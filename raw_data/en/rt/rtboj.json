The purpose of the CHNA was to identify and analyze community health needs and assets and prioritize those needs to inform strategies to improve commun ity health. This assessment focused on the following Hudson County areas: Bayonne, Hoboken 07310), and Union City . Context This CHNA was conducted during an unprecedented period due to the COVID -19 pandemic and the national movement for racial justice. The COVID -19 pandemic impacted both the CHNA data collection process, as well as topics and concerns that residents raised in focus groups and key informant interviews. A wave of national prot ests for racial equity in 2020 highlighted how racism is embedded in systems across the US. The national movement informed the content of this report including the data collection processes, design of data collection instruments, and the input that was shared during focus groups, key informant interviews, and through survey responses. Methods While this CHNA aimed to be comprehensive, its data collection approach focused on the social and economic upstream issues that affect a community's health. Data coll ection was conducted using a social determinants of health framework and a health equity lens. The CHNA process utilized a mixed - methods, participatory approach that engaged agencies, organizations, and community residents through different avenues. The CH NA process was guided by the strategic leadership of the RWJBH Systemwide CHNA Steering Committee, the JCMC Community Outreach & Social Impact Steering Committee , the JCMC/Hudson County CHNA Advisory Committee, and the community overall. Data collection m ethods included: Reviewing existing social, economic, and health data in the JCMC primary and secondary service area s in Hudson County . Conducting a community survey with 273 residents d esigned and administered by Bruno & Ridgway. Facilitating 6 virtual focus groups with 1 05 participants from populations of interest, including veterans, and residents who identified as Black , Asian, and Latino, the latter held in Spanish . Conducting 7 key informant interviews with 12 community stakeholders from a range of sectors. Facilitating a guided discussion with the JCMC Community Outreach & Social Impact Steering Committee. Jersey City Medical Center /Hudson County CHNA Focus Area 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment ii Findings The following provides a brief overview of the key findings that emerged from this assessment: Population Characteristics Demographics. In 2020, Hudson County was the fourth most populous county in New Jersey with 671,923 residents. Its population increased by 1.4% between 2015 and 202 0.1 Participant s in focus group and interview discussions valued Hudson County's racial/ ethnic and language diversit y and robust foreign -born population . Residents identifying as Latino ma de up 40.4% of the county's residents , followed by those identifying as White (28.5%), Asian (17.0%), and Black (9.8%).2 In 2016 - 2020, the foreign -born population ranged from 19.4% in Hoboken to 62.8% in Jersey City zip code 0731 0, with many residents from India and the Dominican Republi c.3 Veterans ma de up about 2% of the Hudson County population , with the highest percentage in the city of Bayonne (3.9% ). Community Social and Economic Environment Community Strengths and Assets. Interviewees and focus group participants mentioned numerous positive aspects of their communities, including an abundance of resources and amenities, community solidarity , and robust partnerships , made stronger during COVID -19. Top strengths identified b y community survey respondents in 2021 include d that it was easy to find fresh produce and that their communities had safe outdoor places to walk and play. Nearly 60% of respondents indicated that their communities were a good place to raise a family and h ad places for everyone to socialize.4 Education. Graduation rates across Hudson County school districts differed, with Bayonne , Union City, and Jersey City experiencing lower graduation rates than the other communities and the state. There were racial/ethnic disparities in graduation rates , with Black and Latino students experiencing lower graduation rates than their White and Asian counterparts.5 Particip ants identified \"Community schools \" and Tiger's Den at Snyder High School, resulting from a partnership between the Jersey City Board of Education , JCMC, educators, families, and the communit y, as promising initiatives to address the needs of low -income st udents of color and increas e graduation rates . Inequality . Growing inequality was a recurrent theme in focus groups and interviews with participants describing the area as \"a tale of two cities .\" Development was seen as focusing on the wealthy, while r esidents emphasized how neighborhood concentrated poverty compounded the effect of household poverty . They highlight ed the linkage between income, hopelessness, poor education outcomes , and violence. Inequality was reflected in education, employment and workforce, income and financial security, access to healthcare, and other areas . 1 U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2011 -2015 and 2016 -2020 2 U.S. Census Bureau, Decennial Census of Population and Housing, 2020 3 U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 4 Community Health Needs Assessment Survey Data, Bruno & Ridgway, 2021 5 New Jersey Department of Education, School Performance, Adjusted Cohort Gradua tion Rates, 2020 -21 \"There is something going on almost every week to help with food, home purchases, and other things. T hat's one of the things I really love about Jersey City.\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment iii Employment and Workforce. Unemployment rates in Hudson County were trending downward over the decade prior to the COVID -19 pandemic and rose substantially in 2020 , similar to the rest of the state and country . While rates declined in 2021, unemployment has not yet fallen to pre -pandemic levels. Unemployment rates in 2016-2020 ranged from 2.4% in Jersey City zip code 07302 to 7.0% in Jersey City zip code 07305 and 9.2% in Jersey City zip code 07304 .6 Fewer than four in ten survey respondents agreed that \"there are job opportunities in my area.\" Participants indicated that LGBTQ+ populations, veterans, and essential workers were the most affected by unemploymen t and underemployment. Income and Financial Security . Median household income in Hudson County showed stark disparities , ranging from $49,457 in Union City, with a majority Latino population , to $153,438 in Hoboken, a predominantly White area.7 In 2019, 29.8% of Black children and 23.4% of Latino children lived in poverty , compared to 9.8% in the county overall .8 Among veterans, 7.5% lived below the poverty line in the county overall , with 21.4% doing so in Jersey City zip code 07306 .9 Focus group participants shared the day -to-day challenges of affording housing , food, and healthcare as prices continue to climb across the board . While the rising cost of living affects everyone, participants shared that it has been most painful for low -wage workers and those on fixed incomes, such as seniors. Food Access and Food Security. Participants mentioned that many families with children - often immigrants -, older adults , and those who were housing insecure were struggling to put food, particularly healthy food, on the table. Residents reported that food insecurity increased during the COVID -19 pandemic, despite stepping up food distribution efforts. Around one in four survey respondents overall, and about one in three Latino respondents, indicated that they relied on food pantries or othe r food assistance programs.10 Housing. Participants reported that affordable housing in their communities was sparse and difficult to obtain. Residents discussed the challenges of qualifying for affordable housing, rising rents due to an influx of New York ers, increasing socioeconomic segregation , and homelessness. More than half of renter -occupied households in Hudson County spend 25% or more of their monthly inc ome on housing costs , ranging from 39. 0% in Jersey City zip code 07302 to 66.5% in Union City and 64.6% in Jersey City zip code 07305 .11 6 U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 7 U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 8 U.S. Census Bureau, Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates, as reported by County Health Rankings, University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2019 9 U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 10 DATA SOURCE: Community Health Needs Assessment Survey Data, Brun o & Ridgway, 2021 11 U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 Percent Population Food Insecure, by State 8.6%11.1% 12.0%15.5% New Jersey Hudson County2019 2020 Feeding America, Map the Meal Gap 2021 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment iv Transportation. Participants valued the ample availability of public t ransportation options in Hudson County. Most participants indicate d that they were not car dependent and noted that it was easy to get around. In addition, participants indicated that the partnership s between health care facilities and private transportation companies facilita ted access to health care for older adults , persons with disabilities, and violence survivors. Green Space and Built Environment. Multiple residents expressed their concerns that there were too many new constructions , result ing in overpopulation and a shrinkage of green space. Participants highlighted the importance of emergency preparedness for flood ing and mentioned that mitigating redevelopment projects were underway. Residents also noted the contribution of grassroots organizations to public park maintenance , also important for increased water absorption. About 70% of Hudson County survey respondents agreed or completely agreed with the statement, \"My community has safe outdoor places to walk and play.\"12 Violence Prevention and Safety . Similar t o the 2019 CHNA, for many, violence prevention and safety continue to be priority issues for many residents. Participants shared differing views about safety and violence. Many indicated being safe in their neighborhoods, while others reported being nervou s about crime . In 2020, Jersey City (432 per 100,000 residents) had more than double the violent crime rate (i.e., murder, rape, aggravated assault) than the state average (195 per 100,000 residents).13 Black residents indicated that they experienced a disproportionate burden of violence, including gun violence, and trauma, with Black survey respondents' marking violence/community safety as the top health priority.14 Key informant interviewees indicated that Jersey City has robust programs and resources to address and mitigate the impact of violence and trauma , including the Anti-Violence Coalition and Project H.U.D.S.O.N . According to interviewees, promising results to interrupt the cycle of violence have been achieved by reaching survivors soon after injury and providing trauma -informed intensive case management and wraparound services, including safe housing and vocational training, in addition to medical care and counseling. Systemic Racism and Discrimination. With few exceptions, participants spoke of pervasive inequities experienced by people of different groups. Residents discussed the multiplying effect of historical and current discriminatory practices due to multiple conditions, such as race/ethnicity, gender, immigrant status, and socioe conomic status, among others. Participants noted these issues largely impacted communities of color because of the policies and practices embedded throughout society. Residents mentioned that some Hudson County municipalities have put in place programs to address the effects of systemic racism, such as first -time homeowner programs for low -income residents, rent control policies, and programs to promote minority and/or wom en owned business. However, participants emphasized that more are needed. 12 Community Health Needs Assessment Survey Data, Bruno & Ridgway, 2021 13 State of New Jersey, Department of Law and Public Safety, Uniform Crime Reporting Unit, 2019 14 Community Health Needs Assessment Survey Data, Bruno & Ridgway, 2021 \"The undocumented are scared to ask for help, and we are seeing that community getting jumped overnight, not wanting to go to the hospital over what they will get charged. \"- Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment v Community H ealth Issues Perceptions of Community Health. Focus group participants and interviewees identified social and economic issues such as financial insecurity, housing, and transportation as top community concerns, noting that these issues affect other aspects of health. Participants also discussed challenges in accessing care, the increase in mental health concerns, and the lingering effects of the COVID -19 pandemic. Community survey respondents ranked mental health, overweight/obesity, high stress lifestyle, affordable housing , and affordable eldercare as the top five health concerns in the community . Leading Causes of Death and Premature Mortality. Heart disease, COVID -19, and cancer were the top three leading causes of death in Hudson County in 2020. In 2018 -2020, Black residents experienced higher rates of premature mortality (deaths before age 75) than any other racial/ethnic groups.15 Obesity, Healthy Eating, and Physical Activity. While overweight/obesity was identified as the second top health concern (after mental health) by community survey respondents,16 it was not a prominent theme in conversations with residents . Participants mentioned disparities in the availability and affordability of healthy foods by neighborhood, with some areas considered food deserts. Some residents indicated enjoying the area's walkability , while others noted safety issues , sidewalks in dis repair , and time constraints as barriers to physical activity . Chronic Diseases . Like findings from the 2019 CHNA , chronic diseases continue to be a top community concern. Data show racial/ethnic disparities in chronic disease burden across Hudson County. Black residents experienced higher cardiovascular disease mortality rates than other racial/ethnic groups in the county. Diabetes was a top priority concern and participant s indicated that it was highly prevalent in their communities. The cancer mortality rate in Hudson County was highest among Black (182.9 per 100,000) , followed by White (148.5 per 100,000) , residents.17 In terms of chronic disease screenings, 70% of community survey respondents indicated that they had participated in a cholesterol screening, and nearly 8 7% had participated in a blood pressure screening in the past two years.18 Many participants mentioned health care costs as a barrier to chronic disease management. Disability. While the issue of disabilities did not emerge often in the qualitative discussions , many people with disabilities face economic instability as they rely on government financial ass istance programs for their basic needs. A key informant interviewee highlighted the importance of early intervention to address the needs of children with disabilities.

Echoing the 2019 CHNA, m ental health disorders were the top health priority selected by survey respondents and a prominent theme in interviews and focus groups. Job loss and economic pressures and the uncertainty associated with the pandemic were cited as contributors to increased stress and depression by Hudson County residents , including among veterans and member s of the LGBTQ+ community . Participants indicated stigma , long wait times for appointments, and unavailability of multilingual mental health care providers as barriers to accessing care. Several participants identified substance misuse , relapse, and overdose deaths among young people as a further health concern in the aftermath of COVID -19, with the drug poisoning rate increasing from 2016 to 2020.20 Environmental Health. The rate of age -adjusted ED visits for asthma declined in Hudson County from 201 8-2020.21 It should be noted that this decline may be due to individuals with asthma being reluctant to seek care during the height of the COVID -19 pandemic. The proportion of children born in 2014 who were tested for lead exposure before 36 months of age is higher in Hudson Count y (77.6%) than in the state (74.4%) .22 Communicable Disease s. Conversations related to COVID -19 primarily focused on how the pandemic exacerbated existing social and economic inequities . Several participa nts were concerned by the increasing rates of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV and chlamydia , among women of color and the LGBTQ+ population . The rate of HIV transmission for Black New Jersey residents was 30.2 per 100,000 persons, ten times higher th an among White residents (3.1 per 100,000). Nearly 3,000 per 100,000 women aged 15-24 contract 19 U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 20 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, Underlying Cause of Death 1999 -2020 on CDC WONDER Online Database, 2016 and 2020 21 New Jersey Discharge Data Collection System, Office of Health Care Quality Assessment, New Jersey Department of Health, New Jersey State Health Assessment Data (NJSHAD), 2018 and 2020 22 New Jersey Birth Certificate Database, Office of Vital Statistics and Registry; Child Health Program, Family Health Services, as reported by, New Jersey Department of Health, New Jersey State Health Assessment Data (NJSHAD), 2022 Population to Mental Health Provider Ratios , by State and County, 2019 450:11570 :1 New Jersey Hudson County DATA SOURCE: National Provider Identification Registry, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \"[COVID impacted] housing, food insecurity, jobs, people have a fear of going back to work, and childcare, because there was a time when everything was virtual, how can parents afford to stay home and put food on the table ?\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment vii chlamydia annually in Hudson County.23 Participants also expressed concerns about the roll -back of reproductive rights and the negative impact that would have on women's health, noting the inequitable burden on low -income women. Maternal and Infant Health. Maternal and infant health indicators are markers of inequity as most maternal and perinatal health complications ar e preventable with access to quality, adequate , timely care and information, including comprehensive sexual ity education . In Hudson County, a lower percentage of Black and Latino residents sought prenatal care in the first trimester compared to Asian and W hite residents. The rates of low birth weight and preterm births among infants born to Black residents roughly double d those of White residents ,24 indicating health care access barriers. Access to Services Access to Preventive Services. Participants reported that access to routine screenings and preventive care declined since the onset of the COVID -19 pandemic , despite the efforts of many partners. Participants indicated that having a primary care provider and/or access to a trusted FQHC facilitated access to care. Approximately 77% of community survey respondents reported having an annual physical exam and 74% a flu shot in the last two years.25 Access to Primary C are Services. Cost, workforce capacity, insurance, and language and cultural factors were most often mentioned by focus group and interview participants as barriers to accessing primary care. Community survey respondents indicated ability to schedule an appointment at a convenient time, insurance problems, cost of car e, and wait times as the main barriers to care.26 About 30% of respondents indicated never experiencing barriers. Within the JCMC service area, the proportion of uninsured residents was highest in Union City (23.4%) and lowest in Hoboken (2.7%) .27 Some p articipants, particularly veterans, mentioned experiencing disruptions in access to mental health services during the pandemic , including to support groups and counseling, leading to treatment setbacks and substance use relapse . Community -Based Organizations and Coalitions . Partnerships between the community -based organizations, hospitals, schools , and the government were seen as a strength in Hudson County and critical to providing services to those in need. City-wide efforts such as HealthierJC have been important to coordinate efforts across multiple partners, including the business community. Residents and public health administrators uplifted the role of community -based nonprofits in bridging the gap to services for those most marginalized. Most participants saw a promising role for a strong and broad coalition in Hudson County. 23 Communicable Disease Reporting and Surveillance System, New Jersey Department of Health, as reported by the New Jersey State Health Assessment Data (NJSHAD), 2020 & 2021 24 New Jersey Birth Certificate Database, Office of Vital Statistics and Registry, New Jersey Department of Health, New Jersey State Health Assessment Data (NJSHAD), 2015 -2019 25 Community Health Needs Assessment Survey Data, Bruno & Ridgway, 2021 26 Community Health Needs Assessment Survey Data, Bruno & Ridgway, 2021 27 U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 \"We have great partners. Hudson County is very tight, so we all work together - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment viii Community Visio n and Suggestions for the Future Health as Human Right: \"It is urgent to have access to free, quality health care .\" To overcome cost barriers, p articipants recommended expanding access to free or low-cost preventive care ; loosening the requirements to qualify for free and/or low -cost health insurance ; and simplifying the charity care application , including for those who are foreign -born . They also suggested \"meeting people where they are\" by using mobile and school -based clinics , organizing education sessions in all neighborhoods , and offering appointments outside of the regular workday . Participants highlighted the community school model as a promising initiative to promote the well -being of low -income families . Improving Access to Services and Community Outreach . Echoing 2019 CHNA priorities, many community participants emphasized improving access to primary care as a priority for the coming years . Numerous interviewees and focus group participants noted the need for better communication about existing programs and services. Participants suggested organizing informational sessions in different neighborhoods and languages on topics that affect the com munity, such as chronic disease management , and developing a centralized list of programs and resources, similar to the mental health directory prepared by the Health Department (https://healthierjc.co m/mental -health/ ), but for other conditions. Greater Accessibility and Availability of Behavioral Health Services . Participants suggested that expanding culturally -competent trauma -informed mental hea lth care , particularly for Black, LGBTQ+, veterans, violence survivors, and young residents, should be a priority in the coming years . They recommended diversifying the mental health work force , expanding community -based affordable mental health services, increasing long -term treatm ent and maintenance options for persons with substance use disorders, and developing additional prevention education programs to destigmatize mental health disorders among many cultural groups. Sexual and Reproductive Health and Women's Health . Participants underscored the importance of offering comprehensive sexuality education in schools to reduce sexually transmitted infections and reduce unplanned pregnancies among teens ; increasing access to information and reproductive health commodities to address the rise in sexually transmitted infections among cisgender women and men -who -have -sex-with -men ; and mitigating the repercussions of the rollback in constitutional protections to reproductive choice that could u nduly affect low -income women and co mmunities of color, thus, exacerbating existing racial/ethnic and social inequities in maternal and infant health. Reducing Inequity and Focusing on the Social Determinants of Health. For several interviewees and focus group members, a vision of the future included steps to reduce inequ ity and address the social determinants of health. o Expanding E mployment Opportunities: Recommendations to improve economic and employment opportunities included: 1) incorporating more vocational training programs in high schools to facilitate transition into the workforce ; 2) incentivizing employers to hire veterans and \"My biggest wish for this community is that we don't have such an economically diverse community. If there's a way to really help the fam ilies with the lowest economic resources to really have more financial stability, that would be ideal .\" - Key informant interviewee 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment ix transgender and other LGBTQ+ people ; 3) providing expanded workforce protections (e.g., sick leave, improved wages, childcare) for all workers, including those who are foreign -born; and 4) supporting small business owners. o Addressing the Housing Deficit : Recommendations related to expanding access to housing and addressing homelessness included: 1) earmarking more affordable housing units in the new developments, including housing for veterans; 2) implementing the existing rent control policies, which also apply to foreign -born residents regardless of immigration status; 3) renovating abandoned build ings for low -income families ; 4) increasing the availability of safe temporary shelters for unhoused individuals, including for domestic and community violence survivors; and 5) fomenting first -time buyers' subsidies as a promising initiative to address in tergenerational poverty . Partnerships, Community Engagement, and Community Building . Participants valued the robust partnerships established among multiple organizations and across sectors and suggested deepen ing engagement with trusted community -based organizations, such as those representing Asian, Latino, and LGBTQ+ residents, as partners in outreach and information sharing about community services and programs. Participants underscored more community outreach, a strong plan to reengage the community, and investing in the community as strategic areas moving forward. Key Themes Several overarching themes emerged from the Jersey City Medical Center /Hudson County 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment. Importantly , several key areas, including increasing access to care, the importance of preventive care , and safety and violence prevention echoed those priorities identified by the community in 2019 as part of the prior CHNA process, and provide an opportunity to continue building upon those efforts. The Hudson County communities that JCMC serves are diverse and health disparities exist. There is great variation in terms of demographic composition, income levels, and health status in Hudson County , with over 40% of residents not English proficient . Secondary data show disparities in healthcare access and health outcomes based on race/ethnicity. A larger proportio n of Asian and Latino community survey respondents reported feeling discriminated against when receiving care. Secondary data show that Black residents experience higher rates of premature, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality, and diabetes compared to residents of other racial/ethnic groups. Residents viewed chronic conditions as prevalent and linked to the social determinants of health . Diabetes and high blood pressure were discussed as prevalent in the community, especially among low-income residents an d communities of color, and survey respondents indicated \"overweight/obesity\" was the second most common health issue in their community. However, focus group participants focused on the barriers to healthy living faced by residents, including affording healthy foods, cost of medication, and having time to exercise and to spend outdoors . \"Prices have been slowly rising, amazing that they have money to build these new buildings but can't help people maintain the property they have here ....\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment x Housing, food insecurity , and employment opportunities are top community concerns. Participants identified lack of quality affordable housing as a ke y gap in the area . Food insecurity was another area of concern , with almost half of Latino survey respondents worrying about running out of money to purchase food. Housing and food are related to income . Over 10% of Hudson residents reported being unemployed during the pandemic, with large variation by neighborhood. Overall, participants recommended the adoption of more policies to promote equity and support the well - being of low-income residents . Mental health was identified as a significant community health concern. Mental health was identified as a top community health concern, closely associated with racial/ethnic disparities, economic instability, and chronic conditions. Black residents faced a dispro portionate mental health burden. The rate of mental health hospitalizations in 2020 was 70% higher among adult Black residents (107.1 per 100,000) than the Hudson County average (63.1 per 100,000). Black children had 38% higher hospitaliz ation rates for mental health conditions than the county rate (34.7 per 100,000 vs. 25.2 per 100,000). Veterans and LGBTQ+ advocates also highlighted the mental health needs of their communities. Residents mentioned stigma and insufficient culturally competent providers as the principal barriers to mental health care access and emphasized the need to engage in more education efforts . Violence as an important health concern . Violence and safety were raised as community concer ns. Some participants indicated that their neighborhoods were safe; however only 40% of survey respondents agreed that violence was not prevalent in their communities.28 Further, violence and safety w ere mentioned as the top health concern by Black survey respondents. Participants suggested continuing to strengthen efforts to end the cycle of violence by addressing its social determinants of health, through support of programs such as the Anti-Violence Coalition and Project H.U.D.S.O.N. Hudson County has a wealth of social service organizations and health care services, including those providing preventive care, though many residents experience barriers to accessing these resources. Residents remarked that Hudson County had a wealth of healt h care and social service assets. Residents noted that having a primary care doctor and being linked to a FQHC and/or a community -based organization were facilitating factors to accessing care. They also discussed the importance of culturally competent providers, including providers who spoke their language and looked like them. Veterans and those working with violence survivors highlighted that having pee rs and mentors who could provide trauma informed care helped to be engaged in care. Participants in the healthcare field unanimously noted a decline in access to preventive care and mentioned this as a priority strategic area. Recommendations in this area included continuing to uplift partnerships and community engagement to bridge the care gap. Another recommendation included better communication about existing programs and services to reach multiple constituencies. Conclusion s Through this comprehensive and iterative assessment process, ten major areas were identified as community needs after gathering input through qualitative data from residents and stakeholders, feedback from a community priorities survey, and quantitative surveillance an d secondary data. These included in no particular order : 28 Community Health Needs Assessment Survey Data, Bruno & Ridgway, 2021 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment xi Financial Insecurity Unemployment Food Insecurity Housing Chronic Diseases (e.g., heart disease, cancer, diabetes) Infectious Diseases, including COVID -19 Violence Prevention & Safety Mental Healt h Substance Use Access to Preventive Care After a prioritization process with the Advisory Committee and discussions within the hospital taking into consideration existing expertise, capacity, and experience, JCMC will focus on Access to Preventive Care; Chronic Disease Management, including Behavioral Health Services; Food Insecurity and Education; and Violence Prevention and Safety as priorities during the development of its implementation plan i n 2023. JCMC will tackle these priority action areas as part of ongoing community engagement efforts and with an overarching emphasis on addressing systemic racism, racial injustice, and discrimination .2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 1 Introduction Community Health Needs Assessment Purpose and Goals A community health needs assessment (CHNA) is a systematic process to identify and analyze community health needs and assets, prioritize those needs, and then implement strategies to improve community health. In 202 2, the RWJBa rnabas Health Jersey City Medical Center (JCMC ) undertook the current CHNA process using a mixed -methods and participatory approach . JCMC is located in Jersey City, Hudson County, New Jersey , and is part of the RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH) system. RWJBH is a non -profit healthcare organization which includes 1 2 acute care hospitals, three acute care children's hospitals, a leading pediatric rehabilitation hospital, a freestanding acute behavioral health hospital, a clinically integrated network of ambulatory care centers, two trauma centers, a satellite emergency department, geriatric centers, the state's largest behavioral health network, ambulatory surgery centers, comprehensive home care and hospice programs, long term care facilities, f itness and wellness centers, retail pharmacy services, medical groups, diagnostic imaging centers, a clinically integrated network and collaborative accountable care organization . As one of the licensed general acute care hospitals and one of two trauma centers within the system, JCMC admits nearly 16,000 inpatients and provides over 201,000 outpatient visits annually. In 202 1, the 34 8-bed hospital attended over 81,100 emergency department visits and delivered nearly 2,000 babies. JCMC is a DNV (which stands for det norske veritas) fully accredited hospital and has been recognized for its excellence in providing care and support for the health and wellness of the Hudson County community. In early 2021, RWJBH hired Health Resources in Action (HRiA) , a non -profit public health consultancy organization, to provide support, help facilitate, and conduct data analysis for the CHNAs across the system. HRiA worked closely with RWJBH, JCMC , the JCMC Community Outreach & Social Impact Steering Committee , and a Jersey City/Hudson County CHNA Advisory Board The RWJBH JCMC /Hudson County CHNA aims to gain a greater understanding of the issues that community residents face, how those issues are currently being addressed, and where there are gaps and opportunities to address these issues in the future. This report presents findings from the 202 2 JCMC needs assessment processes, which was conducted between March -September 2022. The specific goals of this CHNA are to: Systematically i dentify the needs, strengths, and resources of the community to inform future planning, Understand the current health status of the service area overall and its sub -populations within their social context, Engage the community to help determine community needs and social determinant of health needs, and Fulfill the IRS mandate for non -profit hospitals. Area of Focus This CHNA process aims to fulfill multiple purposes for a range of stakeholders. To be as inclusive as possible, t he focus area of the RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center /Hudson County CHNA encompasses JCMC's primary and secondary service areas in Hudson County . JCMC's primary service area include the 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 2 following Jersey City zip codes : includes Bayonne, Union City and Hoboken, which encompass the following zip codes : 07002, 07087, and 07030, respectively. Both the primary and secondary service areas are the focus of this CHNA , represented in Figure 1 below. Context for the Community Health Needs Assessment This CHNA was conducted during an unprecedented time, given the COVID -19 pandemic and the national movement for racial justice. This context had a significant impact on the assessment approach and content. COVID -19 Pandemic The country was still recovering from the novel coronavirus (COVID -19) pandemic when the activities of this assessment were conducted. This impacted both the CHNA data collection process and topics, as well as concerns that participants put forth during discu ssions in focus groups and interviews. In March 2022, at the beginning of this CHNA process, the COVID -19 pandemic had already been in effect for over two year s. Logistically, the pandemic impacted the feasibility of convening in -person groups for the CHNA (e.g., subcommittees, focus groups, etc.) and the availability of key stakeholders and community members to participate in CHNA activities, given their focus on addressing immediate needs. Consequently, all data collection and engagement occurred in a vir tual setting (e.g., telephone or video focus groups, interviews), and engagement of residents and stakeholders was challenging. (A more detailed description of this engagement process may be found in the Methods section, and COVID -19 data specific to this service area is provided in the Infectious and Communicable Disease section of this report.) Substantively, during the CHNA process, COVID -19 was and remains a health concern for communities and has also exacerbated underlying inequities and social needs. The pandemic brought to light both the Figure 1. Focused JCMC CHNA Area Map 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 3 capabilities and gaps in the healthcare system, the public health infrastructure, and social service networks. In this context, an assessment of the community's strengths and needs, and in particular the social deter minants of health, is both critically important and logistically challenging. This CHNA should be considered a snapshot in time, which is consistent with public health best practices. Moving forward , the community should continue to be engaged to understan d how identified issues may evolve and what new issues or concerns may emerge over time. National Movement for Racial Justice Over the past few year s, sparked by the national protests for racial equity amidst the killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, B reonna Taylor, Tony McDade, and many others, national attention was focused on how racism is embedded in every system and structure of our country, including housing, education, employment, and healthcare. This context impacted the content of the CHNA, inc luding the design of data collection instruments and the input that was shared during interviews and focus groups. While racism and oppression have persisted in this country for over 400 years, it is important to acknowledge the recent focus on these issue s in 202 2 in the form of increased dialogue, locally and nationally, as context for this assessment. Awareness of racism and discrimination among Hudson City residents was renewed in 2022 with ongoing incidents of anti -Asian hate crimes and the naming of Jersey City by the Buffalo mass shooter. Methods The following section details how data for the CHNA were compiled and analyzed, as well as the broader lens used to guide this process. Social Determinants of Health Framework While this CHNA aimed to be comprehensive, its data collection approach focused on the social and economic upstream issues that affect a community's health (Figure 2). Upstream Approaches to Health Having a healthy population is about more than delivering quality healthcare to residents. Where a person lives, learns, works, and plays all have an enormous impact on health. Health is not only affected by people's genes and lifestyle behaviors, but by upstream factors such as employment status, quality of housing, and economic policies. Figure 2 provides a visual representation of these relationships, demonstrating how individual lifestyle factors, which are closest to health outcomes, are influenced by more upstream factors, such as employment status and educational opportunities. 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 4 Figure 2. Social Determinants of Health Framework DATA SOURCE: World Health Organization, Commission on the Social Determinants of Health, Towards a Conceptual Framework for Analysis and Action on the Social Determinants of Health, 2005. The data to which we have access is often a snapshot in time, but the people represented by that data have lived their lives in ways that are constrained and enabled by economic circumstances, social context, and government policies. To this end, much of thi s report is dedicated to discussing the social, economic, and community context in which residents live. We hope to understand the current health status of residents and the multitude of factors that influence health to enable the identification of priorit ies for community health planning, existing strengths and assets upon which to build, and areas for further collaboration and coordination. Health Equity Lens The influences of race, ethnicity, income, and geography on health patterns are often intertwined. In the United States, social, economic, and political processes ascribe social status based on race and ethnicity, which may influence opportunities for educational and occupational advancement and housing options, two factors that profoundly affect health. Institutional racism, economic inequality, discriminatory policies, and historical oppression of specific groups are a few of the factors that drive health inequities in the U.S. In the present report, health patterns for the Hudson County area are described overall, as well as areas of need for particular population groups. Understanding factors that contribute to health patterns for these populations can facilitate the identification of data -informed and evidence -based strategies to provid e all residents with the opportunity to live a healthy life. Approach and Community Engagement Process The CHNA aimed to engage agencies, organizations, and community residents through different avenues. The CHNA process was guided by strategic leadersh ip from the RWJBH Systemwide CHNA Steering Committee, the JCMC Community Outreach & Social Impact Steering Committee , and the community overall. RWJBH System Engagement This CHNA is part of a set of CHNAs being conducted across the entire RWJBH system. Ea ch of these CHNAs use s a consistent framework and a minimum set of indicators but the approach and engagement 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 5 process are tailored for each community. A Systemwide CHNA Steering Committee was convened twice prior to the launch of JCMC CHNA process (early a nd late June 2021). This Steering Committee provided input and feedback on major data elements (e.g., secondary data key indicators, overall Table of Contents) and core prioritization criteria for the planning process. A list of Systemwide CHNA Steering Committee members can be found in Acknowledgments section. CHNA Advisory Committee Engagement A CHNA Advisory Committee was constituted to guide th e process . The Advisor y Committee included over 80 stakeholders representing a range of relevant fields and organizations throughout Hudson County. The CHNA Advisory Committee was engaged at critical intervals throughout this process. In March 2022, the Advisory Committee met for a kick -off meeting during which HRiA p rovided an overview of the CHNA process and Bruno & Ridgeway, Inc. presented the findings from a community survey the firm conducted in 2021. These two presentations were followed by a brief Q&A and discussion with Advisory Committee members. After the mee ting, Advisory Committee members were invited to participate in a survey to help identify what populations and sectors to engage in focus groups and key informant interviews. The results of this survey directly informed development of an engagement plan to guide qualitative data collection. During the data collection process, Advisory Committee members also assisted with organizing focus groups with community residents, participating in key informant interviews, and/or connecting HRiA to stakeholders in the community. The Advisory Committee reconvened in October 2022. During this meeting, HRiA staff presented the findings from the CHNA process, including preliminary priorities that emerged upon review of the qualitative and secondary data. Advisory Committe e members had the opportunity to ask questions, then discussed and voted on the top priorities for the hospital to consider when developing its implementation plan. A detailed description of the prioritization process can be found in the Prioritization Pro cess and Priorities Selected for Planning section. In addition, t he JCMC Community Outreach & Social Impact Steering Committee was engaged throughout the process as a means of obtaining feedback from internal JCMC stakeholders who have firsthand knowledge of the community. Members of the JCMC Steering Committee participated in the Advisory Committee activities a nd in a focus group in June 2022 . The JCMC Steering Committee reviewed the report in full and adopted it in a meeting in November 2022 . See Appendix A for a list of CHNA Advisory Committee members , which include the JCMC Steering Committee members . Commun ity Engagement Community engagement is described further below under the primary data collection methods. Capturing and lifting up a range of voices, especially those not typically represented in these processes, was a core component to this initiative. It should be noted that, due to the COVID -19 pandemic, the community engagement for this CHNA occurred virtually. Additionally, while the CHNA aimed to engage a cross -section of individuals and to be inclusive of traditionally under -represented communities, outreach was challenging given the pandemic and competing priorities. Nevertheless, by engaging the community through multiple methods and in multiple languages, this CHNA aims to describe community strengths and needs during this unique time. Secondary Data: Review of Existing Secondary Data, Reports, and Analyses Secondary data are data that have already been collected for another purpose. Examining secondary data helps us to understand trends, provide a baseline, and identify differences by sub -groups . It also helps in guiding where primary data collection can dive deeper or fill in gaps. 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 6 Secondary data for this CHNA were drawn from a variety of sources, including the U.S. Census American Community Survey (ACS), the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Federal Bureau of Investigation Uniform Crime Reports, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, County Health Rankings, the New Jersey Department of Education, New Jersey Department of Health's New Jersey State Health Assessment Data (NJSHAD ), and a number of other agencies and organizations. This CHNA also utilizes reports from a variety of organizations at the community, state, and national level , including , but not limited to , the United Way of New Jersey's ALICE Study, The Partnership for a HealthierJC, and others. Additionally, hospitalization data from the RWJBH system is also included in Appendix H. Secondary data were analyzed by the agencies that collected or received the data. Data are typically presented as frequencies (%) or rates per 100,000 population. It should be noted that when the narrative makes comparisons between towns, by subpopulation, or with NJ overall, these are lay comparisons and not statistically significant differences. It should also be noted that for most social and economic indicators, the U.S. Census American Community Survey (ACS) 5 -year (201 6-2020) aggregate datasets were used over the one -year datasets, to improve statistical reliability for areas with small er population sizes and small population subgroups. Since the ACS uses a probability sampling technique, using the five -year aggregate dataset over the one - year data provides a larger sample size and more precision in its estimates. Primary Data Collection Primary data collection entailed a mixed methods approach consisting of interviews , focus groups, and a community survey, as detailed below. Qualitative Discussion: Key Informant Interviews and Focus Groups Key Informant In terviews A total of seven key informant interview discussions were completed with 1 2 individuals by Zoom or telephone. Interviews were 35-60-minute semi -structured discussions that engaged institutional, organizational, and community leaders as well as front -line staff across sect ors. Discussions explored interviewees' experiences of addressing community needs and priorities for future alignment, coordination, and expansion of services, initiatives, and policies. Sectors represented in these interviews included: local public health department s, public education , housing services, the faith community, and those who serve/work with specific populations (e.g., immigrant community, LGBTQ residents, young people ). See Appendix B f or a list of organizations engaged through key informant interviews and Appendix C for the key informant interview guide. Focus Groups A total of 105 community residents participated in 6 virtual focus groups (telephone or video) conducted with specific populations of interest: veterans, Black residents, Spanish -speaking Latino residents, and Asian residents . Focus groups were up to 60 -minute semi -structured conversations and aimed to delve deeply into the community's needs, strengths, and opportunities for the future and to gather feedback on priorities f or action. Please see Appendix D for the focus group facilitator's guide. In addition, a guided discussion was carried out with the JCMC Community Outreach & Social Impact Steering Committee , who se members are in direct contact with Hudson City residents in their role as health care providers, hospital administrators, leaders, and community residents themselves. The discussion lasted 60 minutes and was conducted via Zoom. The discussion aimed to determine 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 7 perceptions of the strengths and needs of the Hudso n County community served by JCMC, and identify the sub-populations most affected , to explore how these issues can be addressed in the future , and t o identify opportunities for JCMC to address the community needs more effectively moving forward. Analyses The collected qualitative information was coded and then analyzed thematically by data analysts for main categories and sub -themes. Analysts identified key themes that emerged across all groups an d interviews as well as the unique issues that were noted for specific populations. Throughout the qualitative findings included in this report, the term \"participants\" is used to refer to key informant interview and focus group participants. Unique issues that emerged among a group of participants are specified as such. Frequency and intensity of discussions on a specific topic were key indicators used for extracting main themes. While differences between towns are noted where appropriate, analyses emphasi zed findings common across the service area. Selected paraphrased quotes \u2014without personal identifying information \u2014are presented in the narrative of this report to further illustrate points within topic areas. Community Survey A community priorities survey was developed and administered over a six-month period from April to August 2021 by the survey firm Bruno & Ridgway, who was contracted directly by the RWJBH system. The survey focused on health issues and concerns that impact the community; community saf ety and quality of life; personal health attitudes, conditions , and behaviors; barriers to accessing health care; discrimination when receiving medical care; and the impact of COVID -19 and vaccination compliance. The survey was administered online and was available in paper in 5 languages (English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, and Chinese). Outreach for survey dissemination was conducted with assistance from the RWJBH system, the hospital, and its community partners, as well as through social media and the web . Additionally, an online panel sample was recruited to capture additional survey responses from specific areas to augment the larger sample. Postcards with QR codes that linked to the survey were distributed at vaccination events for community members to take while they waited for their COVID -19 vaccine. The final sample of the community priorities survey comprised 273 respondents who were residents of Hudson County. Appendix F provides a table with demographic composition of survey respondents. Respondents to the Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment Survey were predominately White, female, and high er socioeconomic status. About 74% were employed full -time. Throughout this report, Hudson County residen ts who participated in the Community Health Needs Assessment Survey are referred to as \"respondents\" (whereas focus group members and interviewees are referred to as \"participants\" for distinction) . Analyses Frequencies were calculated for each survey question. Not all respondents answered every question; therefore, denominators in analyses reflect the number of total responses for each question, which varied by question. Statistical testing (Z -tests) was cond ucted across sub -groups to determine whether there were significance differences between groups. Survey data by race/ethnicity specifically is presented in this report. Racial/ethnic groups are delineated by a letter (A, B, C, D). When a graph has a letter next to the bar, it indicates that the group for that bar has a statistically significant different frequency of responses compared to the group of the letter shown (e.g., when an A is on the bar of White respondents, it indicates that percentage of White respondents answering the question in that 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 8 particular way is statistically significantly different than Asian respondents). Significant differences at 90% confidence levels are presented in the report. Data Limitations As with all data collection efforts, there are several limitations that should be acknowledged. Numerous secondary data sources were drawn upon in creating this report and each source has its own set of limitations. Overall, it should be noted that differe nt data sources use different ways of measuring similar variables (e.g., different questions to identify race/ethnicity). There may be a time lag for many data sources from the time of data collection to data availability. Some data are not available by sp ecific population groups (e.g., race/ethnicity) or at a more granular geographic level (e.g., town or municipality) due to small sub -sample sizes. In some cases, data from multiple years may have been aggregated to allow for data estimates at a more granul ar level or among specific groups. With many organizations and residents focused on the pandemic and its effects, community engagement and timely response to data collection requests were challenging. Additionally, with its online administration method, the community survey used a convenience sample. Since a convenience sample is a type of non -probability sampling, there is potential selection bias in who participated or was asked to participate in the survey. Due to this potential bias, results cannot ne cessarily be generalized to the larger population. Similarly, while interviews and focus groups provide valuable insights and important in -depth context, due to their non -random sampling methods and small sample sizes, results are not necessarily generaliz able. Due to COVID -19, focus groups and interviews were also conducted virtually, and therefore, while both video conference and telephone options were offered, some residents who lack reliable access to the Internet and/or cell phones may have experienced difficulty participating. This report should be considered a snapshot of an unprecedented time, and the findings in this report can be built upon through future data collection efforts. 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 9 Population Characteristics Population Overview According to the 201 6-2020 American Community Survey (U.S. Census), Hudson County is the fourth most populous county in New Jersey (671,923 residents) . The Jersey City Medical Center's primary and secondary service area comprises 6 Jersey City zip codes (totaling 330,002 residents) , and the cities of Bayonne (65,112 residents) , (68,073) . There has been great variability in population growth across the areas examined. Whereas New Jersey ov erall and Hudson County , specifically, have seen minimal changes in total population between the periods 2011 -2015 and 2016 -2020 , Jersey City zip code 07302 experienced a population growth explosion (18.5 %), whereas zip codes 07306 and 07307 experienced an important population exodus during the same period ( -7.1% and -9.9%, respectively) . The population of Bayonne and Union City declined (-0.4% and -0.8%, respectively ) and that of Hoboken increased (1.6%) minimally over this time (Table 1). Table 1.

Age distribution data by town and gender can be found in the Appendix of additional data. 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 10 Figure 3. Age Distribution, by State and County, 2016 -2020 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2011 -2015 and 2016 -2020 When examining age distribution data by race/ethnicity in Hudson County, children under 18 made up a greater percentage of the population among persons of Other Race (26.9%) and Hispanic/Latino s (15.7%) , followed by Black (14.6%) , and a smaller proportion of Asian (11.2%) and White (10.3%) residents. Adults aged 65 and over comprise d 9.9% of the White population compared to 6 .1% of the Asian population , see Table 2. Table 2.

Racial, Ethnic, and Language Diversity Racial and Ethnic Composition Focus group members and interviewees described their communities as racially and ethnically diverse and valued this diversity as one of Hudson County's greatest assets. The secondary data support these perceptions. Hudson County is predominantly made up of Hispanic/Latino residents, which make up 40.4% of its population , followed by White non - Hispanic (28.5%) , Asian (17.0%), and Black (9.8%). Huds on County has proportionally more Hispanic/Latino and Asian residents than New Jersey as a whole ( Figure 4). See the Appendix for detailed data tables. Figure 4. Racial and Ethnic Distribution, by State and County, 2020 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, Decennial Census of Population and Housing, 2020 Data labels not shown for p ercentages <4% . In 2016 -2020, the racial and ethnic distributions varied widely across Hudson County (Table 3) with Hoboken and Union City being the most homogenous cit ies, and zip codes within Jersey City being quite diverse . For example, in Jersey City zip code 07310, 57.3% of the population identified as Asian, compared to 3.5% in Union City . The largest Black population was found in zip codes 07305 and 07304, which made up 4 4.1% and 3 4.8% of residents, compared to 2. 3% in Union Hispanic/Latino White, non-Hispanic Other, non-Hispanic \"Jersey City's greatest strength has always been diversity .\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 12 Residents identifying as Hispanic/Latino made up 76.7% of the Union City and 42.2 % of the Jersey City zip code 07307 population , in contrast to 9. 3% in zip code 07310. Residents identifying as non -Hispanic White were concentrated in Hoboken ( 67.1% of residents) , followed by Bayonne ( 44.3 %), and made the smallest proportion of the population in zip code 07305 (11. 7%).

Multiple waves of migration resulted in pockets of recent and not -so-recent immigrants from many Latin American and Caribbean as well as South east Asian countries . Secondary data show varying levels of the foreign -born population across Hudson County. More than two out of every five Hudson County residents are foreign born (43.6%), double the percentage of foreign -born residents in New Jersey as a whole (22.7%) . In 201 6-2020, the foreign - born population ranged from 1 9.4% in Hoboken to 62.8% in Jersey City zip code 07310 (Figure 5). In Hudson County, the most common countries of origin for immigrant residents were India and the Dominican Republic (making up 12.8% and 12.1% of the immigrant population, respectively) . The majority of other immigrants were from Latin America and the Caribbean , primarily Ecuador, Cuba, and Colombia (see Table 4). \"The [Filipino] community has strong roots, and generations of families that have made Jersey City their home .\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 13 Figure 5.

The anti -immigrant rhetoric of recent years, coupled with inc reases in raids targeting immigrants, has severely affected the mental well -being of this community , provoking undue stress and anxiety . This is coupled by barriers to access basic protections related to employment and housing due to their legal status. Further, these populations have been among the most affected by COVID -19, both in terms of sickness, as well as in terms of job loss. Whereas free or low-cost medical care is available to everyone regardless of documentation status via the FQHCs and other providers , participants commented that more efforts are needed to reach the entire eligible population and bridge the care gap. Language Diversity A majority of Hudson County residents over age five (59.1%) reported speaking a language other than English at home in 201 6-2020, with large local differences. For example, almost five in six Union County residents (81.8% ) and four in six in Jersey City zip codes 07306 (63.9%), 07307 (64.2%), and 07310 (65.2%) spoke a language other than English at home , compared to one in four Hoboken residents (26.4%) (Figure 6). A variety of languages are spoken across Hudson County, as indicated in the secondary data and supported by qualitative discussions. The most spoken languages other than English are Spanish (37.1%) , other Indo -European (2.6%), Chinese (2.4%), and Tagalog (2.1%) (Table 5). Other languages spoken include Russian, Polish and other Slavic languages ; French , Haitian or Cajun ; Korean ; and Vietnamese, reflecting the county's diverse communities. The distribution of these languages is not even. For example, t hree -quarters of residents in Union City speak Spanish (75.8%) , while 24.9% of residents in Jersey City zip code 07310 speak other Indo -European languages and 19.7% speak Chinese . There are also , for example, pockets of Arabic speakers in Bayonne and Jersey City zip codes 07306 and 07304 ; while the Filipino community is largely concentrated in Jersey City zip codes 07304, 07305 , and 07306 . \"This a time when immigrants are feeling unsafe.

Based on resident feedback, Hudson County is a welcoming place for foreign -born persons, non -English speakers, and people of diverse ethnic backgrounds . A Filipino resident expressed it as, \"the [Filipino] community has strong roots, and generations of families that have made Jersey City their home.\" Overwhelmingly, r esidents indicated that they enjoyed the opportunity to learn about different cultures, and to access foods and other cultural elements from a va riety of regions. As a focus group participant explained, \"It's a multicultural city so you have several different ethnicities... you get to learn about the food and people's culture.\" Residents overall also valued that medical and social services providers looked like them and spoke to them in their native language. However, opinions differed in terms of the availability of multilingual providers and providers of color. Whereas resident s of Indian descent indicated that \"there are plenty of Indian, multiple language speakers, physicians in the JCMC and in the community ,\" Latino residents were more nuanced noting that whereas the federally qualified health centers ( FQHCs ) had ample Spanish speakers, hospitals in the area needed more staff that spoke t heir language. While diversity was a substantial community strength, participants noted that it could also be a challeng e to engagement . In Hudson County, 40.5% of residents were not proficient in English in 2016 - 2020 , ranging from 18.4% in Jersey City zip code 07310 to 48.3% i n Union City . Lack of English proficiency can pose a barrier to entering the professional workforce, learning, and accessing healthcare. Those working in the social sector worr ied about populations not reached with information or services. In the words of a public health official, \"we talk to funders all the time about how to translate health information into other languages, how to connect to communities. We talk about it all the time, how to get into mosques, communicate in o ther ways besides English newspapers, how to create equity for people who are following the news.\" In addition, lack of English -proficiency can lead to discrimination. According to survey data, 22.7% of Asian respondents and 17.6% of Latino community respo ndents specifically described being discriminated against because of language/speech issues when receiving medical care (discussed in greater detail in the Discrimination and Racism section of this report.) \"I do feel welcome by healthcare providers, but I have experienced going with my parents who are immigrants with heavy accents, and I have experienced miscommunication. \" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 17 Figure 7.

About 2% of the Hudson County population are veterans, with the city of Bayonne having the highest percentage of the areas observed (3.9%) ( Figure 8). The race/ethnicity of veterans in Hudson County mimics the diversity of the county's population . Hudson County has proportionately more veterans who identify as Asian (6.1%), Black (15.6%), and Latino (29.1%) residents than the state (Figure 9), with important variation across neighborh oods. A majority of veterans in Jersey City zip codes 07304 and 07305 identify as Black (42.6% and 63.4%, respectively) , whereas 40.8% of veterans in Jersey City zip code 07310 identify as Asian, and 68.6% of veterans in Union City identify as Latino. Bayonne and Jersey City 0 7302 have the highest concentration of White veterans Jersey City (07304) Jersey City (07305) Jersey City (07306) Jersey City (07307) Jersey City (07310) Union City2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 18 Figure 8.

When examining the educational attainment of veterans in Hudson County, we observe that most veterans did not have a bachelor's degree or higher (71.4%) ( Figure 10). Only 10.8% of residents obtained a college degree in Jersey City zip code 07304, where many Black veterans reside . Employment and education , together with mental and physical health, are closely related to poverty. A higher proportion of veterans in Hudson County live below the poverty line than in New Jersey (7.5% vs. 5.2%, respectively). This proportion is much higher in Jersey City 07306, where one in five veterans liv e in poverty, and Jersey City zip code 07305, where 18.0% do. It is important to remember that the poverty line is substantially below a livable income and has become even more so recently with high rates of inflation . Special issues faced by veterans are discussed throughout the report in the specific topic area sections. Figure 10.

Percent Veterans Below Poverty Level, by State, County, and Town, 2016 -2020 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 Community Social and Economic Environment Income, work, education, and other social and economic factors are powerful social determinants of health. For example, j obs that pay a living wage enable workers to live in neighborhoods that promote health (e.g., built environments that promote physical activity and resident engagement, better access to affordable healthy foods), and provide income and benefits to access health care. In contrast, unemployment, underemployment, and job instability make it difficult to afford housing, goods and services that are linked with health and health car e, and also contribute to stressful life circumstances that affect multiple aspects of health . Community Strengths and Assets Understanding the resources and services available in a community \u2014as well as their distribution \u2014helps to elucidate the assets that can be drawn upon to address community health, as well as any gaps that might exist. Strong Community and Partnerships In addition to diversity noted previously , another strength mentioned by participants was solidarity and a strong sense of community . Time and time again, participants noted that neighbors came together to help those in need . As a resident noted, \"My specific neighborhood is very close knit, you know the people in the area and people are willing to help you. For example, when it snows , I've had young kids, young teenagers ask like, can Jersey City (07304) Jersey City (07305) Jersey City (07306) Jersey City (07307) Jersey City (07310) Union City2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 21 Residents remarked that the community was able to organize and take action to address people's needs and this came to the forefront throughout the pandemic , including through generous donations . A healthcare administrator echoed this sentiment , \"these are communities that show up when the need is there, and we saw that during the COVID pandemic. We raised over a million dolla rs for an emergency response fund, from old donors and new donors.\" At an institutional level, another strength are the robust partnerships established among multiple organizations and across sectors , including grassroots organizations , government, small businesses, social services agencies, and health care centers . These collaborations are exemplified by the Partnership for a HealthierJC, made up of nearly 300 member organizations. A public health official noted, \"We have great partners. Hudson County is very tight, so we all work together. \" As a health administrator said when reflecting on the response to COVID -19, \"As organizations ... who did demonstrate that more than whatever resources were available to our community , we all jumped in and that includes J ersey City Medical Center . We were able to get people in and out of the hospitals quickly and people were able to communicate with each other .\" This was echoed by public health staff from different areas of Hudson County, as exemplified by what this participant from Bayonne said, \"Whenever there is an emergency , Bayonne comes together as a community to help people out, through donations or referra ls for services.\" Public Services and Programs Some participants indicated that their elected officials were a source of strength in Hudson County. A diverse array of residents, including from the Latino, Asian, and LGBTQ+ community, indicated being represented and supported by government leaders. One example of support for the LGBTQ+ community was the recent passing of the law to let students use bathrooms that are consistent with their gender identity , considered an important step in fostering welcoming and safe spaces for gender nonbinary youth. Residents noted that the Jersey City government was responsive to their needs and that they received abundant support during the COVID -19 pandemic, as expressed by a Latino resident, \"The mayor's office provides very good services ; for example, if someone has to travel far to get to the doctor, or if they need translation of a document to Spanish \u2014you can call the mayor's office for everything.\" Overall, residents indicated that Hudson County offers many services to people to ensur e that residents live well and can access their basic needs. The map below shows the distribution of hospitals, schools, and childcare centers in the area. There are four acute care hospitals as well as 151 schools and 301 childcare centers in the JCMC s ervice area (Figure 12). \"I'm new to Jersey City, but I noticed since doing Covid work in June that there is a strong sense of community. \" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 22 DATA SOURCE: New Jersey Geographic Information Network (NJGIN), Schools and Child Care Centers, 2018 and Acute Care Hospitals, 2020 As one resident summed up, \"...there is something going on almost every week to help with food, home purchases, that's one of the things I really love about Jersey City.\" A Hoboken resident expressed something similar , noting that a strength in Hoboken were the \"strong non -profit orga nizations and religious organizations that provide supportive services related to housing assistan ce and information, nutritional support, recreational activities for children, tutoring ...\" Latino residents discussed how the county offered resources in the community to support people, including people who are low -income, undocumented , and/ or without health insurance . Other Community Assets Community survey respondents partially agreed with these themes. When asked how much they agreed or disagreed with a number of statements about their community, responses were similar to when this survey was administered in 2019. The strengths identified by the greatest proportion of respondents in 2021 were that it was easy to find fresh fruits and veget ables in their communities (73.6 %), that their communities had safe outdoor places to walk and play (70.3 %), and that their community was a good place to raise a family (59.7%) and to socialize (58.2%) (Figure 13). These were the same top responses in 2019. Figure 12. Community Assets Map of Hudson Count y, 2018 & 2020 \"From my experience, over 20 years, I feel that the greatest strength s are the community -based organizations. We have a wide range of individuals who form different communities, even small grassroots community -based organizations, to engage people in healthy ways .\" - Key informant interviewee 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 23 Figure 13. Percent o f Community Survey Respondents Noting Strengths in Their Community (Agree or Completely Agree with Statements) (n=2 73), 2021 DATA SOURCE: Community Health Needs Assessment Survey Data, Bruno & Ridgway, 2021 However, responses to these questions varied by race/ethnicity . For example, as can be observed in Figure 14, White respondents were significantly more likely than Asian, Black, and Latino respondents to agree or completely agree that their community had safe outdoor places to walk and play. As desc ribed in the Methods section, when a graph of community survey data has a letter next to the bar, it indicates that the group for that bar has a statistically significant different frequency of responses compared to the group of the letter shown . As shown, whereas 81.0% of Wh ite respondents perceived outdoor spaces as safe, only 59.1% of Asian respondents did so. Whereas there were no significant differences by respondents' race/ethnicity to the statement about having spaces to socialize, Asian (63.6%) and White (66.7%) respondents more often indicated that the community was a good place to raise their family than Black (34.6%) respondents (Figure 15). (More detailed discussions of responses by different population groups of other survey questions are found in the topic -specific sections of this report.)

School Environment and Health A positive school environment is an important determinant of physical and mental wellbeing, as well as academic success, staying in school, and opting to continue on to higher education. An interview ee who was a member of the LGBTQ+ community lauded schools for their efforts to make school safe and welcoming to all youth. In their word s, \"[LGBTQ+] youth are still dealing with bullying, [but] schools are reaching out to learn and make spaces safer. School leaders come in to engage us as a liaison, to organize school clubs that are inclusive and to receive cultural competency training from us.\" Conversely, being healthy is a key factor in being academically successful. Schools play an important role in facilitating access to care and helping students stay healthy. A school administrator described some of the public school 's efforts to address the mental health needs of students, \"We've been trying through the schools with our resources to really embed more social and emotional [support to] help students overcome challenges, develop resilience, and be able to speak about thei r emotions. [We have] incorporated that through the curriculum, through our school counselors, through our school psychologist.\" Many students also face poverty and food insecurity; in providing free or low -cost lunches , schools also play an important role in ensuring basic nutrition for children. Public School ing Focus group and interview participants discussed how the public school system in Hudson County faces a variety of issues. One is a lack of sufficient resources to attend to the needs of high -need population groups. There is a perpetual shortage of qualified educators , particularly in those areas where teachers need additional certifications or schooling. An education adminis trator emphasized that more qualified Special Ed ucation teachers, bilingual teachers , and content area teachers, like those that teach Science and Math, are needed to meet the needs of the student population . Another issue that came up was the lack of affordable after school programs, particularly important for children of low-income earners. In some areas of Hudson County, such as Hobo ken, a problem identified by participants was that there is insufficient space to accommodate the growing number of school children . Residents expressed that \"[population] growth was not planned ,\" leading to overcrowding in public and charter schools . Residents discussed how new buildings and improved infrastructure for schools were needed to accommoda te the influx of new residents coming to the new condominium buildings. In spite of these challenges, most Hudson County residents indicated that public school leadership was supportive of students' needs and open to partnerships with different organizations to better serve the community. Many residents remarked that the school leadership was attuned to the needs of students and their families , many of whom face multiple struggles . Given the large immigrant community in Hudson County, schools must accommodate to the needs of English -language learners. 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 26 Key informant interviewees indicated that Hudson County public schools fall along a broad spectrum encompassing both the top-ranking , as well as the lower performing , schools in New Jersey . School p erformance is determined largely by the socioeconomic situation of the community that draws the student population. There is an inverse association between socioeconomic status and high school graduation rates. Key informant interviewees noted that s tudents experiencing poverty often had to drop out of school to start working and contribute an income to their families. These students' vision for the future oftentimes does not include college as a career path unless they have access to a mentor who can help them enter a professional career . Key i nformant interviewees explained that low -income students face d multiple obstacles to entering college , including not being able to afford it; having to full-time to support the family; and not seeing the usefulness of a college degree . Based on this contex t, key informant interviewees indicated that p ublic schools were trying to equip students' transition into the workforce by incorporating classes and training related to workplace readiness. \"We've been working on it trying to incorporate more careers, not just OK you're gonna graduate and go to college and then get a job. But, you kno w, addressing the needs of those students who will not go to college .\" Inequities in school performance are confirmed by graduation rate data from different Hudson County districts . Whereas in 2020 -2021 the Hoboken Public School District had graduation rates slightly above those of New Jersey as whole (93.6% and 92.6%, respectively), the public school districts of Bayonne, Union City, and Jersey City had lower graduation rates , with significant disparities by race/et hnicity within districts ( Table 6). For example, 95.3% of Asian students graduated from High School in Bayonne in 2020 -2021, compared to 86.4% of Black children and 78.5% of Latino children. Additional information on differences in educational attainment by race/ethnicity and by town is available in Appendix F. Table 6. 4-Year Adjusted Cohort High School Graduation Rate, by Race/Ethnicity and School District, 2020 -2021 New Jersey Statewide Asian, Non - Hispanic Black, Non- Hispanic Hispanic/ Latino 95.9% Wide 88.3% 90.5% N DATA SOURCE: New Jersey Department of Education, School Performance, Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rates, 2020 -21 NOTE: * indicates that data is not displayed to protect student privacy. An N indicates that no data is available. \"We have children who are immigrants and come in when they're 16 years old and are learni ng English . They need to graduate from high school, but they also need a job because economically they need to go work. It's a challenge.\" - Key informant interviewee 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 27 Promising Initiatives To better address the needs of community, the Jersey City Board of Education has partnered with educators, families, and the community as a whole to launch a promising model known as 'community schools. ' Community schools provide additional services than regu lar school s to meet the needs of students and families . In addition to regular school offerings, community schools aim to connect students and parents with a wide range of services , including afterschool programs, counseling, and social services. This model has helped to improv e attendance , grades, and student and parent engagement. Some of the schools have brought in health clinics that offer nutrition and health care to both students and the ir families . According to a school administrator , the key to the success of one of the community schools is that \"it's a very cohesive community,\" with \"good leadership at the school that has been good in working with the community, the providers ,\" and the fact that \"the staff, the teachers are all vested and making it successful .\" Another successful initiative that participants discussed was The Tiger's Den at Snyder High School, a result of a partnership between JCMC , The NJ Department of Childre n and Families, and the Jersey City Board of Education. The Tiger's Den offer s free, confidential social services to students, families, and staff , includ ing psychological counseling, vocational counseling , workplace readiness programs, academic support, summer employment, and after school programs . The Tiger's Den also assigns students with mentors who they can talk to about their problems and guide them to resolve issues in a positive way. Graduation rate for students participating in The Tiger's Den was 99% compared to 60% in the school overall. These are promising strateg ies to help more students from low -income families finish High School and either enter the workforce in stable employment or continue on to college , two pathways to facilitate the transition to the middle class . Inequality Growing inequality , exacerbated as much by the COVID -19 pandemic a s by policies and the existing economic model , was a theme that came out strongly in all focus groups and interviews. Most residents across racial/ethnic groups indicated that Jersey City was catering to the wealthy and that income distribution was unequal. As one participant summarized , \"We have the multimillion front, you know , waterfront properties and then we have below the poverty line, urban homes with very urban problems.\" Residents expressed frustration and a sense of injustice witnessing the rapid concentration of w ealth in fewer hands, while employment loss and inflation lead more people into poverty. Residents consistently expressed that the city was catering to affluent families in detriment to middle - and low -inco me residents , and this was evidenced by policies related to real estate credit s; infrastructure and public services investments ; and a regressive taxation structur e. Often, residents attributed racial/ethnic tension to this growing inequality , as expressed by these words , \"From our perspective you do have a lot of stressors around that, especially with gentrification, there is more tension with people originally from the neighborhood as opposite to newcomers. Tax breaks in one section, and in the African American section you can't get your garbage picked up, there is tension and anger from the 'tale of two cities' .\" As these words capture, there is also a racial/ethnic component superimposed on inequality , as Latinos and Black residents are disprop ortionately affected by household and neighborhood poverty. A Black resident reflected thus on the situation , \"they're not really including us in the expansion of Jersey City. Jersey City is up and coming, but they're not making room for low to middle income people... And this is people of all races, they're not gonna pay all that money for taxes, and there are no jobs here.\" 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 28 Neighborhood concentrated poverty compounds the effect of household povert y. Explaining the linkage between income , hopelessness, and violence, a resident noted, \"...And then there's the level of community violence. Feeling really stuck in that cycle that they're in , violence, income or job opportunities, social determinants of health like housing. People are getting push ed out as more development is coming. \" On reflecting about her vision for the future, a key informant interviewee synthesized the voices of many residents , \"My biggest wish for this community is that we don't have such an economically diverse community . If there's a way to really help the families with the lowest resource economic resources to really have a more stable financial sense, that would be the ideal. \" Inequality is reflected in many of the section s of th is report, including education, employment and workforce, income and financial security, and access to healthcare , among others . For example, i ncome inequality is greater in Hudson County (5.9) than in New Jersey overall (5.1) (Figure 16). Income inequality is calculated as the ratio of household income at the 80th percentile to that at the 20th percentile . A higher number indicates a greater income gap between the wealthiest and the poorest households. Figure 16. Income Inequality (80th to 20th Percentile Income Ratio), by State and County, 2016 -2020 DATA SOURCE:U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey as reported by County Health Rankings, University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2016 -2020 NOTE : The ratio of household income at the 80th percentile to that at the 20th percentile, where the incomes of all households in a county are listed from highest to lowest, the 80th percentile is the level of income at which only 20% of households have higher incomes, and the 20th percentile is the level of income at which only 20% of households have lower incomes. A higher inequality ratio indicates greater division between the top and bottom ends of the income spectrum. 5.15.9 New Jersey Hudson County \"It's like they don't want us to be here anymore, they're just welcoming the rich and affluent... It looks like Jersey City is trying to cater to the affluent instead of the people who grew up here.\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 29 Employment and Workforce Employment can confer income, benefits, and economic stability - factors that promote physical and mental health. Two main employment -related issues came out of the focus groups and interviews . On the one hand, many noted that employment opportunities were limited in Hudson County , particularly as a result of the pandemic . Often, they mentioned being unemployed or und eremployed. Residents also said that employment opportunities were limited even among people with college degrees without the right connections. Job instability affected many residents across multiple groups. Multiple residents complained of the dearth of well-paid employment opportunities , that offer employees health and social benefits, a fixed income , and a living wage. Many of the residents we interviewed were working poor, who, despite working , could not afford housing, or had to choose between rent, food or medicine. Indeed, in 2018, one in five of the County's households were Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed (ALICE), meaning that although employed, they did not earn enough to support their families (Figure 17), ranging from 5.1% in Jersey City zip code 07310 to 33% in Union City . Figure 17. Percent Households Falling into ALICE Population, by State and County, 2018 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2014 -2018 as reported by United Ways of New Jersey, Alice in New Jersey: A Financial Hardship Study, 2020 Participants talked about the ch allenges of the COVID -19 pandemic on essential front -line and lower wage workers, many of whom lost their jobs, either temporarily or permanently . Latino participants mentioned that many factories and restaurants closed during the pandemic and that they could not find jobs. The effects of COVID -19 on employment are also reflected in quantitative data. Black and Latino respondents were significantly more likely than White respondents to report having lost income due to COVID -19 (46.2%, 41.2% , and 27.0%, respectively) (Figure 18). Like New Jerse y as a whole, in 2019, prior to the pandemic, Hudson County reported the lowest unemployment rate (3.1%) in recent years according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (Figure 19). However, unemployment rates in 2020 spiked at 10.2% , recover ing slightly to 6.3% in 2021.

However , this varies by race/ethnicity ( Table 8). Indeed, unemployment rates map onto racial/ethnic groups; as discussed in the section on population characteristics, residents in zip code 070302 are predominantly White (40.1%) and Asian (32.2%), whereas over two -thirds of residents in zip codes 07304 and 07305 are Black and Latino (Table 3). The highest unemployment rates in Hudson County were among Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander residents (35.9%), followed by American Indian and Alaska Native residents (10.1%) in 2016 -2020, and the lowest were among Asian (3.5%) and White (4.0%) residents ( Table 8).

Fewer than four in ten respondents agreed that \"there are job opportunities in my area.\" White respondents were more likely than respondents of any other race/ethnicity to perceive that th ere were employment opportunities in their area, although the differences were not statistically significant ( Figure 20). 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 32 Figure 20.

Racial/ethnic differences between groups noted by lettering next to the bars in the graph. It is also important to understand overlapping conditions that may affect entering the workforce. O ver the same period, unemployment rates in Hudson County were highest among women (5.6% among women compared to 4.9% among men) ( Table 22 in the Appendix ) and young people (18.8% among 16 - 19 year -olds and 11.0% among 20 to 24 year -olds) ( Table 23 in the Appendix ). The greatest difference in the female -to-male employment gap was in Jersey City zip code 07304 (10.8% female vs. 7.7% male unemployment rate), an area with many residents of color. Residents noted that certain population subgroups in Hudson County faced more obstacles than others when seeking employment opportunities . Because of stigma and discrimination, Black trans women experienced multiple challenge s to having a professional career and securing living -wage employment. As one key informant interviewee from the LGBTQ+ community explained , \"Black trans women experience the most barriers to employment. They become sex workers for survival. They have difficult experiences applying to jobs. They are ridiculed when applying to places.\" The options for gainful employment also appeared particularly dire for veterans, who are disproportionately Black and Latino. All veteran focus group participants agreed that the only types of jobs available to them either did not pay a living wage or were government jobs. Veteran focus group members expressed frustration at not being able to access satisfying and stimulating employment with growth opportunities. Residents suggested that more should be done to incentivize employers , including private employ ers, to hire trans and veteran residents. When trying to interrupt the cycle of violence, whether domestic or community violence, gainful employment is critical to help survivors get on their feet. As a staff member from a violence interruption program me ntioned, \" Employment is always an issue because you can tell folks a better day is coming, but what is the alternative? We try to never use that language unless we have an alternative. My main thing is stay safe and healthy. With the grant we just received , we have an opportunity to have 40 Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 33 participants, and we train them in electrical, plumbing, HVAC, and carpentry. Now we have something to say, I've got a job for you as long as you learn a skill and graduate from this program.\" Time and time again participants mentioned that lack of secure and well -paid employment was an important contributor to depression. As a public health official said, \"Mental health issues happen because [veterans] cannot find jobs, they don't have the mone y, they have to move in with their parents.\" And she continued , \"it's offensive to put someone who served, someone who earned a degree, behind a cash register... why are companies not stepping up, instead of making exorbitant profits, and training?\" Another resident said, \"[Not having a career], has been a part of my mental health depression.\" Income and Financial Security Income is a powerful social determinant of health that influences where people live and their ability to access resources which affects health and well -being. The effects of poverty \u2014food and housing insecurity, underinsurance , and stress leading to poor physical and mental health \u2014are compounded by environ mental factors. Areas with more concentrated poverty are also those with lower -performing schools, higher rates of community violence and substance use, buildings in worse conditions, and food deserts. Discussing issues related to children, a key informant interviewee said, \"We have, you know, that urban child with very limited resources, poverty, a lot of the issues of poverty and inter generational poverty, with grandparents raising children. \" Many households face financial insecurity across many groups . Both children and youth face substantial insecurity, as well as older adults living on retirement. As discussed in the sections on Inequality and Employment and Workforce , inflation was a major concern for low -income earners as wages have not kept up with the cost of living . People across the spectrum were affected and many residents expressed concerns about the future, mention ing that w ages were not keeping up with inflation , and as a result, more people were experiencing poverty. Income and health are interrelated. Participants mentioned that p eople with chronic illnesses and disabilities often face d financial vulnerability as they were unable to work due to their health . In the words of a resident, \"There's income barriers, which runs into all areas. When you have physical health issues, that leads to loss of income.\" On the other hand, residents noted that healthcare was not a priority when income was limited. Therefore, insufficient income becomes a barrier to accessing health insurance, preventive health care, and even treatment to manage chronic diseases. Many residents described that low -wage earners were faced with the dilemma of having to choose between fo od, rent, or medicine. Household Income and Poverty In Hudson County, financial wellbeing and insecurity varied by area. According to the 2016 -2020 American Community Survey (U.S. Census), while the median household income for Hudson County ($75,062) was below that of New Jersey ($8 5,245) as a whole , the range in household income showed stark disparities. The median annual household income in 201 6-2020 ranged from $49,457 in Union City , where a majority of residents were Latino, to $1 53,438 in Hoboken , with a majority of residents are White (Figure 21). Jersey City zip codes 07304, 07305 , 07306, and 07307 all reported having median household income s below the state average. \"People on the fringe of poverty have suffered .\" - Key informant interview ee 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 34 Figure 21. Median Household Income, by State and County, 2016 -2020 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 When analyzing these figures further, data show that Black and Latino households had lower median household incomes relative to the average across Hudson County. While Asian ($1 16,309) and White ($100,853) households reported incomes that were 55% and 34% higher than median household income in Hudson County ($ 75,062 ), respectively, Black ($ 53,196) and Hispanic/Latino ($ 52,408) households earned 29% and 3 0% below the county median , respectively (Table 9).

Around one in three households in Hoboken (36.9%), Jersey City zip code 07302 (32.4%), and Jersey City zip code 0 7310 (34.8%) had earning s of $200,000 or higher in 201 6-2020 (Figure 22.) On the other hand, more than two in five households in Jersey City zip codes 0730 4, 07305 , and 07306 earn ed a household income of $50,000 or less ; and half of the households in Union City w ere in this situation. Figure 22. Distribution of Household Income, by State, County, and Town, 2016 -2020 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 The percentage of Hudson County residents living below the poverty level represents the most extreme level of financial insecurity. For context, the federal poverty line is the same across the country - regardless of cost of living - but changes by househo ld size. In 2021, individuals living alone or considered a household of one would fall below the federal poverty level at an income level of $12,880, while federal poverty level for a family of four is $26,500. Figure 23 presents data on the percentage of residents falling below the poverty line in the state, county, and town - and zip -code -level. In Hudson County, 14.2% of individuals fall below the poverty line, but it is nearly 20% in Jersey City zip codes 07304, 07305, 07306, and Union City .

Children in Poverty, by State and County, 2019 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates, as reported by County Health Rankings, University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2019 Income and Public Assistance Several national programs administered by the st ate help low -income individuals and families in Hudson County afford basic needs and necessities. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) offers nutrition assistance to certain income -eligible Hudson County residents. From 201 6-2020, 13.9 % of households in Hudson County were receiving SNAP benefits (Figure 25). Of note, Jersey City zip code 07304 had 23.7 % and Union City had 21.6% of households receiving SNAP benefits , compared to 2.3% in Jersey City zip code 07310 . Figure 25. Households Receiving Food Stamps/SNAP, by State, County, and Town, 2016 -2020 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 Public schools nationwide and across New Jersey offer free lunch programs for children living at or near the poverty line (although it should be noted that many public schools currently provide free lunch to all 22.3% 9.8%5.7% 5.7%23.4%29.8% 22.4% 23.4% 7.1%17.2% New Jersey City (07304) Jersey City (07305) Jersey City (07306) Jersey City (07307) Jersey City (07310) Union City2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 38 students as part of the federal COVID -19 relief funding) . However, the percentage of children eligible for the traditional free or reduced -price lunch in Hudson County was 63.5% in the 201 9-2020 school year, much higher than the state overall (38.2%) (Figure 26). Figure 26.

In Figure 27, the participant rate for persons, adults, and children receiving TANF was much higher in Hudson County than in New Jersey overall and peaked in April 2022 with a rate of 648.9 people participating in Hudson County per 100,000 population , more than double the rate of New Jersey as a whole .

However, several focus group participants and key informant interviewees mentioned being faced with the dilemma of not earning sufficient income to cover basic expenses, but not qualify ing for public assistanc e, including housing, food, or health support because they exceeded the poverty line threshold. In the words of a focus group participant , \"I know I don't 38.2%63.6% New Jersey Apr-20 Hudson County2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 39 qualify for housing ---I make too much money. I checked a few years ago because I live with my mom.\" Another participant elaborated, \"The problem in Jersey City is that the preferred housing is based upon income... The problem becomes not making enough to pay the rent, but then living with her mom, so she makes too much money because now they're doing dual income.\" Many residents expressed frustration at losing or not qualifying for benefits because their earnings were t oo high, yet not being able to buy food and other essentials. Residents suggested that the federal government should change the income eligibility limit and that more opportunities should be provided to continue supporting residents as they transition into the workforce. As discussed in the section on Community Strengths and Assets, residents noted that local government had stepped up to address their needs. Food Access and Food Security While many food access barriers are related to income constraints, access may also be more challenging for residents due to geography and transportation challenges. One of the issues highlighted by Hudson County residents was that the quality of the availa ble food varie d a lot by neighborhood. Residents noted that some Jersey City neighborhoods were food deserts , and that in others the supermarkets were not affordable. The availability of supermarkets and grocery stores varied a lot by Hudson County area, with Jersey City zip code 07306 having the largest number of supermarkets (61.7 per 100,000 persons) ( Figure 28). More data on food deserts in Appendix F- Additional Data Tables . Figure 28.

You have to be making way below the poverty level. \" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 40 Food insecurity \u2014not having reliable access to enough affordable, nutritious food \u2014is directly related to financial insecurity. Residents mentioned that many families with children , older adults , and those who are housing insecure were struggling to put food, particularly healthy food , on the table. A focus group participant explained the experience of housing insecure families , \"If I'm staying with someone, I may not be able to cook my own food for my kids, as we just have a room, and maybe I have a little microwave that I could use. I don't want to impose on anybody so I get little , you know , pre-cooked meals ... so we don't get in people's way .\" According to data from Feeding America, Map the Meal Gap confirms that food insecurity is a problem for many residents; Hudson County had a higher percentage of food insecure residents than New Jersey as a whole in 2019 and 2020, and this percentage increased from one year to the next (Figure 29). However, residents also mentioned that food pantries were widely available throughout the city where low-income people could get food and that food vouchers were available to sen iors. Participants spoke about the many food distribution efforts that multiple partners, including government agencies, health care institutions, and non -governmental organizations, carried out during the pandemic to mitigate its effects and make sure that residents did not go hungry. Around one in four survey respondents overall, and about one in three Latino respondents, indicated that they relied on food pantries or other food assistance programs in Hudson County (Figure 30). Other indicators of food insecurity are presented in Figure 30. Figure 29.

Racial/ethnic differences between groups noted by lettering next to the bars in the graph. In addition to food affordability and access, nutrition literacy is important to maintain a healthy diet. Many focus group participants were aware of the association between a h ealthy diet and good health, including its importance in chronic disease management. However, some residents perceived that the main barrier to maintaining a health y diet was lack of education. As one focus group participant mentioned, \"The problem is that people see fast food as a good, cheap option, but it's not healthy - not everyone likes fruit and vegetables.\" Survey data does not seem to support this since perception: whereas a majority of survey respondents of all race/ethnicities reported knowin g what constituted a healthy diet, fewer reported being able to eat healthy foods on a regular basis (Figure 31), indicating that other factors such as affordability and access may be at play . The discrepancy is most marked among Black and Latino respondents. Further, t he availability of fast-food restaurants offering low-cost ultra -processed high caloric food s in certain neighborhoods contributes to the problem (Figure 32).

Housing Landscape As in past CHNAs, there was consensus among focus group members and interviewees that there is a significant need for affordable housing in Hudson County. Many participants noted that housing costs and high taxes were concerns. They described how affordable housing was scarce for members of their community who needed it, like low -wage earners and fixed income residents, and it is harder for others, such as seniors , veterans, and young families, to remain in the area. In the words of a resident, \"One of my friends... his parents had the house, and then he inherited it, but he ended up moving because the taxes were just too high. And that was someone who had been living in that house since birth. And he's sixty -something years old, it's just sad.\" Assessment participants discussed gentrification - the process by which rising housing costs drive out local residents who are replaced by new wealthy residents. As one interviewee described it, \"We can't not mention the housing market, it's a problem overall , but in Jersey the rate of gentrification is increasing rapidly and even those not on the fringe of poverty are experiencing that.\" While participants reported that some new housing is being built, it is not affordable for most. One focus g roup participant explained it thus , \"It's not equal. All the buildings they're putting up are all luxury buildings. When you see the word luxury, you know the rent is astronomical. I can't afford it... whereas affordable housing or housing for seniors is very limited. There are years long waiting lists. It's like they don't want us to be here anymore, they're just welcoming the rich and affluent....\" Housing co sts have been steadily rising in all areas with easy access to New York City, particularly near the waterfront , since 9-11, as New Yorkers sought to leave the city, and COVID -19 accelerated it. Housing Instability and Homelessness Inflation and uncontrolled rent increases following COVID -19 exacerbated people's concerns about housing affordability and housing stability. With some residents' financial situations being more uncertain or diminishing during the pandemic, there was greater concern that residents might lose their housing, even with the multiple housing eviction moratoriums i n place. Overall, 8.8% of respondents in Hudson C ounty reported that they or an immediate family member had lost their housing during the COVID -19 pandemic; this percentage was higher among Latinos (13.2%). Housing availability was also cited by interviewe es as an important barrier to break the cycle of violence . Relocation is one of the strategies used to prevent revictimization of community and domestic violence survivors . However, according to violence interrupters, affordable housing options in low -crim e neighborhoods are limited. Several focus group and interview participants mentioned the problem of homelessness in Hudson County communities. Multiple interviewees and focus group participants indicated that the shelters and temporary housing available were insufficient to meet the needs of the population. They considered the paradox of the proliferation of luxury rental buildings in some neighborhoods, and abandoned buildings in others , while many people are left without homes. One resident emphasized, \"Shelter, I think we need more shelters for the homeless people we have.\" On January 26, 2021, there were 882 persons experiencing homelessness on a single night in Hudson County. Of those counted, 56.1 % lived in Jersey \"It looks like Jersey City is trying to cater to the affluent instead of the people who grew up here .\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 44 City. Black residents shoulder ed the burden of homelessness. Whereas Black residents ma de up 10.3% of the population, and 18.3% of the population living under the poverty line, they made up 39.1% of the population experiencing homelessness. Participants highlighted three priority action areas to mitigate the housing problem in Hudson County : one was enact ing policies related to rent control ; the other was reducing real estate taxes; and the third was the urgent need to build or set aside more affordable housing units . A Latino participant expressed, \"The governor should control the rise of rent prices. These days it can cost $700 for a room in a shared apartment. 10 years ago, an apartment cost $500 -600, but now it can cost $1 ,200.\" Housing quality was another issue that came up in interviews. A few focus group participants commented that s ome of the affordable housing has lead, mold , and asbestos contamination , which can have devastating consequences on residents ' health, particularly among children. The problem was aggravated during COVID -19, which interrupted building quality inspections. Housing data illuminate important disparities and reflects the concerns uplifted by residents. Proportionally f ewer Hudson County residents are homeowners compared to New Jersey as a whole. In New Jersey, 6 4.0% of housing units were owner occupied in 2016 -2020, in cont rast to 32.4% in Hudson County ( Figure 33). Home ownership ranged from 12.5% in Jersey City zip code 07310 to 40.6% in Bayonne . Figure 33.

Median monthly housing costs for owner occupied households with a mortgage ranged from $2, 339 in Jersey City zip code 07304 to roughly $7,600 in Hoboken an d Jersey City zip codes 07302 and 07310 ( Table 11). Median monthly housing costs for renter occupied households ranged from $1, 247 in Union City to $2, 945 in Jersey City zip code 07310 during the same period , 2015 -2019. Table 11. Monthly Median Housing Costs, by State and County, 2015 -2019 Owner -occupied Renter -occupied $1,247 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 The average percent of income spent on housing costs is an important measure of an area's availability of affordable housing. A larger proportion of New Jersey renters, who tend t o be less wealthy than homeowners, spend over a quarter of their earnings on housing. In New Jersey, 4 6.2% of owner - occupied households with a mortgage and 6 2.2% of all renters reported spending spend more than 25% of their income on housing costs ( Table 12). Disparities in housing cost burden exist within Hudson County . In Jersey City zip codes 07302 and in Hoboken , less than one in three owner -occupied and 44% of renter -occupied households reported high housing costs whereas 64.4% of owner -occupied and 66.5% of renter -occupied residences in Union City reported spending more than 25% of their income on housing costs. Additional housing data can be found in Appendix F- Additional Data Tables . Table 12.

Only 27.8 % of survey respondents agreed or complet ely agreed with the statement that there was enough affordable housing that is safe and well -kept in their community. Agreement was least likely among Black and Latino respondents, where only 11.5% and 19.1%, respectively, agreed/completely agreed with the statement about affordable housing , significantly lower than those of White respondents (36.5%) (Figure 34).

Racial/ethnic differences between groups noted by lettering next to the bars in the graph. Homeowner vacancy rate , which represents the proportion of the homeowner inventory that is vacant for sale, is another indicator of lack of affordability , oftentimes due to homeowners' inability to pay real estate taxes. The homeowner vacancy rate was notably higher in Hudson County (2.1%) over the period of 2016 -2020 compared to New Jersey (1.4%) (Figure 35). Vacancy rates were particularly elevated in Hoboken (3.5%) and Jersey City zip code 07307 ( 3.0%) over that time. This reality was also reflected in the interviews with residents. In the words of a Black resident, \"Prices have been slowly rising, amazing that they have money to build these new buildings but can't help people maintain the property they have here - know people who had to move because taxes were too high.\" 27.8% Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 47 Figure 35. Homeowner Vacancy Rate, by State and County, 2016 -2020 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 Housing and Technology Infrastructure Technology is an important tool to access information, services, and resources for individuals, families, and households. The importance of technology - and the consequences of the digital divide - became even more pressing and evident during the COVID -19 pandemic. The ability to be online, participants noted, is essential for residents to connect to resources for education, employment, and other services. Limited technological infrastructure posed an important barrier to learning when public schools moved to online education during COVID -19. Further, given the growth in telehealth, technology is also becoming essential to accessing healthcare. Yet some community residents do not have access to technology \u2014they are unable to afford computers or Internet acces s, or do not know how to use it. One health care provider described, \"People working online tend to be good with telehealth, but there are many who don't know how to connect, don't have what is needed, it is just as hard to get online as it is to travel. \" In 201 6-2020, about 9 3% percent of Hudson County households had access to a computer ( Figure 36). Households in Jersey City zip code 07306 (90.3%) and Bayonne (90.8%) reported computer access that was below the county -wide percentage ; with about 1 in 10 households reporting having no co mputer at home , compared to almost every household in Jersey City Jersey City (07304) Jersey City (07305) Jersey City (07306) Jersey City (07307) Jersey City (07310) Union City2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 48 Figure 36. Households with a Computer, by State, County, and Town, 2016 -2020 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 There were similar trends in household Internet access. Most of the areas that reported a lower percentage of computer access when compared to Hudson County also reported lower levels to the Internet , including Union Cit y (82.5%), and Jersey City zip codes 07304 (84.6%) and 07305 (84.7%) (Figure 37).

Transportation Infrastructure Transportation was often mentioned by focus group and intervie w participants as a top asset in Hudson County . Most participants did not indicate that they were car dependent; instead, they noted that it was easy to get around. A Latino immigrant said that \"public transportation is very good for people who don't drive; everything is close and accessible.\" Affordable and accessible p ublic transportation is important to promote equity, as it provides a means to getting to -and-from work, school, and other locations for low - income residents who cannot afford car expenses and to undocumented residents without a driver's license. Residents appreciated the proximity of Hudson County to New York City, as a source of business and economic development in the area. This is facilitated by the multiple public transportation options available to and from New York City. One resident describ ed Jersey City \"as a transportation rich area where there is a lot of income and economic opportunity, even if it is not very well distributed to everyone who lives here.\" Transportation Partnerships In addition to public transportation, several particip ants indicated that partnership between health care and social services institutions and private transportation companies were an asset and facilitated access to health care and other services and programs, particularly for older adults and violence survivors. While transportation was discussed as a significant asset among focus group and interview participants, survey respondents noted some limit ations of the transportation infrastructure. As shown in Figure 38, only about half of Hudson County survey respondents agreed or completely agreed with the statement, \"My community has transportation services available for seniors and those with disabilities .\" Similarly, slightly over half of survey respondents agreed/completely agreed that their community had transportation services to assist residents in getting to doctor 's appointments . There were no statistically significant differences in these responses by race/ethnicity. 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 50 Figure 38.

Data from the U.S. Census confirmed residents' viewpoints regarding transportation . Residents of Hudson County are a lot less car -dependent than those of Jersey City as a whole . In certain areas, such as Hoboken (52.7%) and Jersey City zip code s 07302 (56.7%) and 07310 (61.8%) , well over half of residents relied on public transportation (Figure 39). Hudson County residents were also more likely to walk to work than in the state overall, with over 7% of survey respondents reporting doing so. One focus group participant summed it up, \"Another strength [of Hudson County] is how easy it is to commute everywhere. We have the Via shuttles, Path trains, buses.\" 53.5%49.8% 54.5%52.3% 50.0%53.8% 50.0%47.1% 57.1%50.8% My community has transportation services for seniors and those with disabilitiesMy community has transportation services that assist residents in getting to doctor appointmentsWhite (n=126) (D) Hispanic/ Latino (n=68) (C) Black (n=26) (B) (n=44) (A) Total (n=273)2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 51 Figure 39. Means of Transportation to Work for Workers Aged 16+, by State, County, and Town 2016 - 2020 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 Similar to other factors, owning a private vehicle is not equally distributed across county residents. Those without a car are usually not home -owners. Acro ss Hudson County, 13.7 % of owner -occupied households and 40.6 % of renter -occupied households did not have access to a personal vehicle in 201 6- 2020 (Table 13); these percentages are much higher than in New Jersey as a whole, possibly denoting the accessibility of public transportation and Jersey City's walkability . Car ownership ranged from 9.8% in Jersey City zip code 07305 to 26.0% in Jersey City zip code 07310 among homeowners ; and from 31.5% in Bayonne to 61.2% in Jersey City Jersey City (07304) Jersey City (07305) Jersey City (07306) Jersey City (07307) Jersey City (07310) Union CityCar, truck, or van (alone) Car, truck, or van (carpooled) Public transportation Walked Other means Worked from home2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 52 Table 13.

Urban environments and physical spaces can expose people to toxins or polluta nts, affecting health conditions such as cancer, lead poisoning, and asthma. Physical space can also influence lifestyles. Playgrounds, green spaces, and trails , as well as bike lanes and safe sidewalks and crosswalks , all encourage physical activity and s ocial interaction, which can positively affect physical and mental health. Residents raised several issues related to the buil t environment. Multiple residents across focus groups expressed their concerns that there were too many new constructions. In their view, overbuilding resulted in overpopulation and shrinkage of green spaces. This issue was summed up by one resident, \"Seein g all of these new buildings that are just being built out of nowhere, blocking the view of the city, being built on green areas, parks. I understand the need to have Jersey City well developed but I think over populating is a concern. Even the smallest em pty area now has a building.\" As mentioned in the Education section, another problem mentioned by residents was that the public school infrastructure in some districts has not kept up with population growth and cannot accommodate the number of school child ren. Other residents mentioned that the older constructions ha d environmental contaminants, including lead and mold, which can have deleterious impact on health (see section on Lead ). Flooding and Emergency Preparedness Participants remarked that s everal areas of Hudson County , particularly those near the waterfront, are flood prone. A housing expert explained that p reparing the county for future floods and an overall rise in water level was an important public health precaution. A key informant interviewee in the housing sector mentioned that several urban redevelopment projects were underway to mitigate possible har m from floods and other natural disasters . The redevelopments would increas e flood storage capacity and improv e floodwater absorption . Further, the interviewee noted that new constructions are planned so as to integrate flooding mitigation and water containment measures . Redevelopment s in some area 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 53 include \"new walkways and parks available for all residents \" and building higher off the ground to prevent water damage. Parks and Green Areas Green area coverage is essential to an environment conducive to good health . Green area coverage not only contribute s to air quality and mental and physical health, but it also serve s as an important flood mitigation strategy as soil absorb s water more readily than concrete. Multiple initiatives are under way in Hudson County to improve green areas; one is the Jersey City Urban and Community Forestry to promote planting efforts and urban reforestation. A health official noted the important contribution of the Jersey City Parks Coalition to these efforts . According to the focus group participan t, the coalition is a volunteer -run grassroots organization which has spearheaded green area betterment and maintenance projects and community events , such as plantings , throughout different Jersey City neighborhood s. The participant mentioned that the y are also lead advocates for more funding for green spaces. The contributions of the Jersey City Parks Coalition were described by a public health official : \"They have worked with the city to determine a priority list, maste r plan, getting a blanket insurance policy to cover all insurance needs for events for all parks.\" According to the participant, t he coalition reflects the city's diversity and serves as a vehicle to engage different sectors of the population. Different g roups mentioned engaging in various outdoor activities. Veterans remarked on how important being involved in organized team sports was to their physical and mental health; they noted that these recreational opportunities were mainly organized by the city. Latino participants indicated walking was their main exercise and valued having access to well -lit, safe parks in their neighborhood. As with other topics, there was a diversity of experience s regarding the availability of green space. Whereas some reside nts indicated that there were plenty of green areas for outdoor activities near their homes, others mentioned not having safe parks nearby . In a participant's words, \"The inner, inner cities , I'm not sure about their parks. I have a park luckily down the street, it's a nice large park, it is safe, it's patrolled by police. But if you go up into the Greenville section , I'm not sure about those parks... it's not as lush and green as Lincoln Park o r Liberty Park.\" These differences were reflected in the community survey . About 70% of Hudson County survey respondents agreed or completely agreed with the statement, \"My community has safe outdoor places to walk and play\" ( Figure 40). However, responses significantly differed by race/ethnicity. Asian (59.1%), Black ( 61.5%), and Latino ( 64.7%) survey respondents were much less likely than White respondents (81.0%) to agre e with the statement about safe outdoor space. \"Where to play safely is not available. When Jersey City is described, it's often just the one nice part of the city, and rarely about the other quadrants.\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 54 Figure 40.

Violence Prevention and Safety Violence and trauma have short - and long -term effects on physical and mental health. People can be exposed to violence in many ways: they may be victims and suffer from premature death or injuries or witness or hear about cri me and violence in their community . Violence and trauma are inextricably linked to the social determinants of health ; people of low socioeconomic status residing in low-resource neighborhoods and schools are at higher risk of experiencing violence. According to an education administrator interviewed , many youths in low -income settings are exposed to domestic and community violence and other adverse childhood experiences , that have a profound impact on their well-being. In 2019, almost two out of every five children in New Jersey had experienced a traumatic event before the age of 18 ( Figure 41). (More localized data not available.) Violence interrupt ion professionals discussed how providing a safe and nurturing environment, access to counseling early on to address the symptoms of t rauma, and paths to educational and economic opportunities were key strategies to interrupt ing the cycle of violence. 70.3% 59.1%61.5%64.7%81.0% (ABC) Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 55 Figure 41.

Many indicated being safe in their neighborhoods , while other s reported being nervous about crime, and yet others that violence was a n \"epidemic .\" Residents' s afety concerns were generally related to gun violence , loitering, and substance use by young people . According to survey data and interviewees, p ersons of color, particularly Black residents, shoulder the burden of violent crime. Figure 42 presents survey data on the percent of respondents who agreed or completely agreed with statements related to violence in their community, overall and by race/ethnicity. Overall, 41.4% of Hudson County survey respondents agreed or completely agreed that vi olence was not prevalent in their community and 34.1 % reported that interpersonal violence was not prevalent in their community. However, responses varied by race/ethnicity , with Black survey respondents being the least likely to agree or completely agree with either of these statements. 61.0% 24.6% 14.4% No ACES 1 ACE 2 or More ACES \"We are very busy, being in Jersey City.

Racial/ethnic differences between groups noted by lettering next to the bars in the graph. Gun Injury and Violent Crime Quantitative data support residents' varied perceptions of risk . Mortality rate by firearm injury in Jersey City from 2015 -2019 was 5.4 deaths per 100,000 residents, higher than those state -wide (5.1 deaths per 100,000 residents) and in Hudson County (3.5 deaths per 100,000 residen ts). In 20 20, rates of violent crime (i.e. , murder, rape, aggravated assault) in Hudson County (280 per 100,000 residents ) were higher than in New Jersey (195 per 100,000 residents ) and varied widely across the county. Jersey City (432 per 100,000 residents ) had more than double the crime rate than the state average and 35% higher crime rate than the county overall ; Union City 's crime rates were slightly higher than Hudson County's (290 per 100,000 residents), whereas Bayonne's (177 per 100,000 residents) and Hoboken's (120 per 100,000 residents) were lower than the state and county average (Figure 43). Property crime (i.e. , burglary, larceny, and auto theft) is much more common than violent crime. Property crime in Hudson County was also above the state average (1,338 and 1,158 incidents per 100,000 persons, respectively). Property crime was most common in Union City (1,694 per 100,000 residents), Jersey City (1,457 per 100,000 residents ), and Hoboken (1,405 per 100,000 residents ) (Figure 44).

Hate Crimes and Anger It is of note that r esidents perceived a change in attitude in the aftermath of COVID -19, which they related to economic and social stressors. Specifically, several residents remarked that people had become less patient and more aggressive since the start of the pandemic . This perception was aggravated by reports of hate crimes motivated by biases against certain groups . As explained by one focus group participant, \"There's an underlying fear, suspicion, you know, not only among African Americans . I mean it wasn't that long ago that we had our own shoot ing up here at a Jewish facility . I think there is a lot of fear in regard to racism and antisemitism.\" Hate crimes were also mentioned as a concern for members of the LGBTQ+ community . A key informant interviewee working with the LGBTQ+ community noted that despite efforts, more action is needed to sensitize police officers , employers, educators, parents, and peer s so as to reduce bullying and harassment , particularly against transgend er youth and children in non -traditional families. 195.4 279.7 176.6 119.8 431.9 290.2 New Jersey City 1,158.2 1,694.1 New Jersey Hoboken Jersey City (citywide) Union City \"It's almost, I don't want to say scary, but after the pandemic , everyone is more angry, everyone wants to argue and fight. \"- Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 58 Violence Interruption Programs According to key informant interviewees, Jersey City has robust programs and resources to address and mitigate the impact of violence and trauma. Since 2014, the grassroots organization Anti-Violence Coalition has been actively working as violence interrupters in the city's South side. As expressed by a coalition member, \"We've been working ... to make an impact on the community, see what the needs are, and lobby or advocate. We've been on the ground occupying corners, conducting surveys, trying to find out the main reasons why people can't be successful in their lives due to issues in the neighborhood that wrap around violence and trauma. \" More recently, t he Jersey City Medical Center created a trauma recovery center, which is a national evidence -based model in treating survivors of violence. Additionally , Project H.U.D.S.O.N. is a Hospital -based Violence Intervention Program, associated with the center , which works with community partners to prevent reinjury and retaliatory action . According to interviewees, p romising results have been achieved b y reaching survivors at bedside , soon after injury, and provid ing trauma -informed intensive case management an d wraparound services , including support for safe housing and vocational training, in addition to medical care and counseling . Systemic Racism and Discrimination Perceptions of racism and discrimination varied in qualitative discussions. Over t discriminat ion due to race /ethnicity or nationality did not often come up . Some participants described witnessing discrimination due to gender and sexual orientation. Focus group and interview participants in multiple conversations brought up issues related to systemic racism and discrimination . With few exceptions, they spoke of pervasive inequities experienced by people of different groups . The conversations highlighted issues of intersectionalit y; participants discussed the multiplying effe ct of historical and current discriminat ory practices due to multiple conditions , such as race/ethnicity, gender, immigrant status, and socioeconomic status, among others . Participants noted these issues largely impacted communities of color because of the policies and practices embedded throughout society. Highlights from these discussions that touch upon specific topic areas (e.g., in equality, education, housing , violence prevention ) are also mentioned in other sections of this report. A theme that was discussed in most focus groups and interviews was the pervasiveness of systemic racism. One of the ways that this was noted was in the gentrification of Hudson County. Multiple participants discussed how the high cost of housing and taxes are driving people of color out of Jersey City. Both quantitative and qualitative data indicate that t here are insufficient affordable housin g units. As a Black resident described, \"A lot of the new constructions are rentals so there would be a reduction of generational wealth. Unless you're earning six figures, it will be a challenge to afford rental units in the future. What is affordable may also not be livable because of gang activity or high crime.\" Residents also noted structural racism in the perennial lack of investment in predominantly Black neighborhoods of Jersey City. They described these areas as having many abandoned buildings in a state of disrepair. Focus group and interview participants acknowledged that there has been much more dialogue about racism and discrimination over the past year. Residents indicated that there were efforts underway in Hudson County to curve at least the most over t forms of discrimination. A focus group participant expressed , \"Jersey City has definitely addressed the Asian hate crimes, even when I was on the PATH train there was a sign that was like there's no room for hate here in Chinese as wel l.\" However, other residents described instances of discrimination and mistreatment against them and their relatives due to their immigrant status. As one resident explained, \"I do feel welcome by healthcare providers, but I have experienced going with my parents who are immigrants with heavy accents, and I have experienced miscommunication.\" 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 59 Systemic Discrimination Based on Legal Status A theme that emerged in some of the interviews and focus groups was the plight of undocumented immigrants , who face multiple economic and social stressors . According to focus group participants, the community is often persecuted by safety systems and live in fear of deportation. Residents explained that undocumented immigrants do not qualify for many government programs, often fear seeking care, and have limited power to negotiate with employers and landlords for salaries and rent control. As noted by several participants, m any have experienced trauma in their home countries, made worse by unstable conditions . Further, par ticipants remarked that c hildren of undocumented parents or who themselves are undocumented often experience depression and anxiety, largely product of an uncertain future. According to residents, a pathway to legalize the situation of undocumented immigra nts to ensure they are afforded all the human rights , many who have been most of their lives in the U.S., is urgently needed to improve their life conditions. Responses also varied by survey respondents. One-quarter of Latino survey respondents indicated that they had ever been personally discriminated against when receiving medical care for their race/ethnicity and 17.6% because of language/speech issues. Asian residents were more likely to report being discriminated against for their culture/religious background (15.9%) and for language/speech issues (22.7%). Percentages for other race/ethnicities was not available due to small sample sizes . Other forms of discrimination were also mentioned in the survey. Among survey respondents, 14.1% reported having ever been discriminated against because of their age ; 14.0% because of their body size; and 16.9% because of their income level. Systemic Discrimination Based on Gender and Sexual Orientation A theme that emerged fr om the qualitative data was discrimination against the LGBTQ+ population. Members of the LGBTQ+ community reported experiencing discrimination based on gender and/or sexual orientation i n medical , educational, and professional settings. As described in the Employment section, Black trans women discussed encountering discrimination in employment due to their gender identity . An LGBTQ+ advocate emphasized more safe spaces for LGBTQ+ youth are needed in schools to prev ent bullying . Also, more education efforts are needed to sensitize parents, educators, and other adults that interact with LQBTQ+ youth to ensure a supportive environment . As noted by an activist, many educators do not have the skills to address the needs of children growing up in non -traditional families. Additional ly, the interviewee discussed how programs to sensitize and train police and healthcare providers should also be offered to promote quality, respectful care that fully addresses the diverse needs of this group , particularly of transgender individuals . One in ten survey respondents in Hudson County reported being discriminated against when receiving medical care because of their gender identity and/or sexual orientation. \"The undocumented are scared to ask for help, and we are seeing that community getting jumped overnight, not wanting to go to the hospital over what they will get charged. \" - Focus group participant \"A doctor told a lesbian woman seeking gynecological care that she didn't need checkups because she didn't have sex with men .\" - Key informant interviewee 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 60 Addressing the Systems of Oppression Quality education is a condition to overcom ing intergenerational poverty resulting from historical systems of oppression . However, residents remarked that, despite attempts to provide adequate budget s, and largely because school financing relies partly on local cost share , public schools in low -income neighborhoods of Hudson County are under - resourced . Residents noted that t he high cost of college poses another barrier for youth growing up in poverty . Further, they explained that the employment opportunities for unskilled workers do not pay a livable wage, nor offer a fixed income and benefits. In the words of a resident, \"There are jobs, I think, if you are well educated that you can sustain yourself on. But if you only have a high -school degree, it might be a bigger challenge.\" Interviewees alluded to how historical discriminatory policies against people of color, such as redlining, coupled with disinvestment and lack of educational and employment opportunities are contributing to growing inequalities and driving more people into the low -middle and low class es. Residents mentioned that some Hudson County municipalities have put in place programs to address the effects of systemic racism, such as first-time homeowner program s for low-income residents , rent control policies , and programs to promote minority and/or woman owned business es. However, participants emphasized that more policies and programs to promote equity and reverse this trend are urgently needed. \"The South side is a beautiful part of town, we've got some issues in some areas because of systemic racism and lack of investment, but it's a beautiful part of town .\" - Key informant interviewee 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 61 Community Health Issues Understanding community health issues is a critical step in the CHNA process. The disparities seen in these issues mirror the historical patterns of structural, economic, and racial inequit ies experienced for generations across the county and the U.S. Community Perceptions of Health Understanding residents' perceptions of health helps provi de insights into lived experiences, including into the key health concerns and facilitators and barriers to addressing health conditions. When asked about top concerns in their co mmunity, focus group participants and interviewees identified social and economic issues such as financial and food insecurity , and housing - and how these were associated with ch ronic conditions that affect many members of the community, including high - blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes . Challenges to accessing healthcare, largely due to cost, was also a top concern among residents. Another issue discussed by multiple groups, was the increase in mental health disorders among th e entire population, but particularly among youth, seniors, and veterans . Other issues that were mentioned included a rise in community and domestic violence, an increase in sexually transmitted infections , and challenges to women's health , the latter in t he context of the wave of legal decisions that curtail reproductive rights . Survey respondents were presented with a list of specific issues and had the ability to add issues not listed. They were asked to mark the top three health concerns or issues for their community. They also were given the option to write in other issues not listed. This feedback complements quantitative data concerning health status and conditions. As shown in Figure 45, mental health, overweight/obesity, and high stress lifestyle were the top three issues noted among survey respondents. This was slightly different than results of the same survey in 2019. In that 2019 s urvey, obesity was the number one community health concern selected by survey respondents, followed by diabetes and then (tied) substance use and mental health. While mental health, overweight/obesity, and high stress lifestyle were the top three communit y health concerns among respondents in the recent survey, d ifferences appear ed by race/ethnicity. While respondents identifying as Asian, Latino, and White shared the three priority health topics describe d above, Black respondents ' top priority area was violence/community safety, followed by mental health issues, and adequate and affordable housing ( Figure 46). \"Diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity in this community is a proble m [among ] people who have a difficult time affording food \"- Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 62 Figure 45.

Leading Causes of Death and Premature Mortality Mortality rates help to measure the burden and impact of disease on a population, while premature mortality data (deaths before age 75 years old) provide a picture of preventable deaths and point to areas where additional health and public health interventions may be warranted. The most current mortality data are available for the period 2018-2020, which includes the first year of the COVID -19 pandemic. The a ge-adjusted mortality rate per 100,000 Hudson County residents was 672.6 in this period ( Figure 47); 7% below the mortalit y rate in New Jersey during the same time period. Figure 47.

Additional leading causes of death include d unintentional injury ( such as unintentional poisonings including drug overdoses, unintentional motor vehicle accidents, unintentional drownings, and falls), stroke, and chronic lower respiratory disease (CLRD - e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma). It is important to note the deleterious impa ct of COVID -19 on mortality , which became the second cause of death in both the state and the county. The mortality rate by COVID - 19 in Hudson County was 46% higher than in the state . Additional data on unintentional injury can be found in Appendix F- Additional Data Tables . Figure 48.

Obesity, Healthy Eating, and Physical Activity Obesity is the second leading cause of preventable death in the United States and increases the likelihood of chronic conditions among adul ts and children. Overweight and Obesity As discussed earlier in the Perceptions of Community Health section, obesity was cited as the second top health concern in the community in the survey (after mental health). However, it was not discussed at length in the focus groups or interviews by participants. Instead, residents from diverse population groups commented on the chronic conditions that are linked to obesity, particularly di abetes , and described how these conditions were prevalent in the community from a very young age . They discussed the social and economic challenges to maintaining a healthy lifestyle , including buying healthy food, access issues in living in a food desert, barriers to seeking medical care, having safe and accessible green space for activity , and time constraints . (See sections related to Food Access and the Built Environment for survey data and surveillance data on perceptions and the landscape related to t he food and physical activity environment.) The latest surveillance data on overweight/obesity is from several years ago. Adults at the state and county level were asked to self -report their height and weight. Based on this self -report, about one in four adults in Hudson County were considered obese , comparable to New Jersey ( Figure 50). In the current community survey for this CHNA, survey respondents were asked to indicate whether they or a ho usehold family member were ever told by a doctor or health professional that they had a 408.7 208.6 146.8 Indian/ Native Asian, Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic Hispanic/ Latino White, Non-HispanicNew Jersey Hudson County2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 66 weight problem ( Figure 51). Among these respondents, almost half ( 46.9%) indicated yes, although responses varied by race/ethnicity . Nearly three in four (72.7%) Black respondents reported this, significantly higher than Asian (41.7%) and Latino (41.0%) respondents. Figure 50.

Participants remarked that physical activity was impor tant for maintaining both physical and mental health. A focus group participant explained the importance of exercise for those experiencing mental health problems and to address isolation, \"I wish more veterans would take advantage of opportunities for umpiring and make a little money on the side - I do various leagues, swimming, softball, baseball . [There are] a lot of opportunit ies for veterans that are just coming out of a mental health area, whereas they want a different avenue to go to, and be part of the community which a lot of veterans try to isolate ... But this is something where you can just come out and do , be a part of the community with fellow veterans, you know. \" Community survey respondents were asked if they were physically active, and nearly 7 8% indicated y es (Figure 52). However, Black and Latino survey respondents were less likely to say that they were currently physically active, with only 6 9.2% and 72.3% saying yes, respectively, a lower proportion when compared to White respondents ( 84.9%). As discussed earlier in this report, Black and Latino survey respondents were also significantly less likel y than White respondents to indicate that there were safe outdoor places to walk and play in their community. Community survey respondents who were parents also indicated whether they would describe their children as physically active or sedentary after sc hool or on weekends . About 78% of Hudson County parent survey respondents described their children as physically active, with 2 1.8% describing them as sedentary. In comparison, only 53.6% of Latino parents indicated their children were physically active. Data is not available for Asian and Black parents. Figure 52.

These data sources collect data on whether respondents had no leisure time activity. Across the state and by county, the percentages of those with no leisure time physical activity were higher in 2018 than in 2014 ( Figure 53). In Hudson County, 29.4 % of adults reported having no leisure time in 2018, compared to 25.3 % in in 2014. Surveillance data from 201 6 to 20 20, by race/ethnicity indicate d that Latino respondents were most likely to report having no leisure physical activity time (32.8%) (Figure 54). Data on access to adequate location to engage in physical activity can be found in Figure 133 in the Appendix. Figure 53.

These difficulties included lack of availability and affordability of healthy foods, depending on food provided by schools or food pantries, living in a \"food desert,\" and not having access t o a kitchen to cook healthier meals for the family. However, other participants mentioned that there were healthy food outlets available in Hudson County. During COVID -19, multiple participants remarked that the community came together to ensure access to healthy foods to those affected by the pandemic via food drives and delivery of healthy food boxes or supermarket gift cards. Residents also noted that low-income seniors could receive food vouchers . In addition, Jersey City Medical Center has a healthy fo od pantry which serves people facing food insecurity, many of whom are seniors. Current surveillance data on fruit and vegetable consumption is not available for Hudson County. New Jersey data indicate that 19.1% of New Jersey adults reported in 2017 that they ate vegetables less than one time per day and 33.6% of New Jersey adults reported eating fruit less than one time per day, according to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey. Eating breakfast daily is an important start to a healthy day. However, c urrent data from the CHNA community survey shows differences by race/ethnicity . Among respondents living with a child, o nly about three -quarters of Black and Lat ino survey respondents (78.6% and 71.4%, respectively) reported that their children eat breakfast daily, significantly fewer than White respondents (97.6%) who se children did so ( Figure 55).

Chronic disease s are also a contributing factor to poor mental health . As a healthcare provider noted, \"There's a lot of depression surrounding getting diagnosed with one of those [chronic] illnesses. They have access to those programs, but they feel beaten down because of misinformation. When they get more information, they feel that they can manage it. The diagnosis can feel like a death sentence sometimes. \" Although chronic diseases are among the most common and costly health problems, they are also among the most preventable through changes in behavior such as reduced use of to bacco and alcohol and improved diet and physical activity. The following section describes the health data (e.g., screening, incidence, mortality, etc.) related to chronic conditions. High Cholesterol and High Blood Pressure Multiple focus group and inter view participants mentioned high cholesterol and hypertension as prevalent in the community , including among children. High cholesterol and high blood pressure are significant risk factors for heart disease, stroke, and other chronic diseases.29 Community survey respondents in spring/summer 2021 were asked about their participation in different types of health screenings over the past two years ( Figure 56). Many respondents (70.0%) in Hudson County indicated that they have received a cholesterol screening, and 86.4% had participated in a blood pressure screening. Black respondents were significantly more likely than Asian , Latino , and White respondents to indicate that they had participated in either type of screening over the past two years. Figure 56.

Approximately 71% and 77% of Hudson County survey respondents indicated that they or member of their family had been told by a health professional that they have high cholesterol and blood pressure , respectively (Figure 57). Black respondents, with the highest rates of both, were significantly more likely than Asian , Latino, or Black respondents to indicate that they or a family member ha d high cholesterol or high blood pressure.

Heart Disease While focus group and interview participants did not directly discuss heart disease, it is the leading cause of death in Hudson County , and closely associated with other conditions mentioned by resident s such as diabetes, high cholesterol, and lifestyle . In the following graph, surveillance data are presented on the numbe r of adults visiting the emergency department for major cardiovascular disease . In 2016 -2020, the rate of heart disease emergency department (ED) visits per 10,000 population in Hudson County was 169.6 visits and the rate of heart disease hospitalizations per 10,000 population was 256.3 , similar to state rates ( (C) White (n=61) (D) Total Asian (n=27) (A) (n=15) (B) Hispanic/ Latino White (n=66) (D)High Cholesterol High Blood Pressure2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 72 Figure 58.

At the county level, the highest percentage was reported by Latino residents (4.3%), higher than the percentage at county and state level. However, data for Black residents was not reliable due to small sample sizes. Figure 59.

Across the state, the overall mortality per 100,000 was 162. 8 and was highest among Black (194 per 100,000) and White (17 2 per 100,000) residents, as well as male (206.7 per 100,000) residents (Figure 60). At the county level, the overall cardiovascular disease mortality per 100,000 was 147, lower t han in the state. Like New Jersey, mortality was highest among Black (194 per 100,000) and White (187 per 100,000) , as well as male (189 per 100,000) residents . Figure 60.

Participants indicated observing an increase in rates of diabetes in recent years and noted that diabetes was highly prevalent in their communities, starting at a young age. A Latino focus group participant described it as, \"Everyone, even children , has diabetes ... What is in the air for everyone to have diabetes?\" Focus group participants attributed the increase in diabetes rates to stress associated with social and economic factors , such as affordable healthy living and access to good healthcare. As one focus group participant stated, \"Diabetes is a very expensive issue in the community, and we'll often see people forgo their medication because they can't afford it or forgo healthy foods because they can't afford it .\" A theme that emerged strongly from participants was the urgent need to address the upstream causes of disease to reduce the incidence of diabetes and other chronic disease among low -income communities and persons of Male FemaleRace/Ethnicity GenderNew Jersey Hudson County2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 74 The following figure shows the percent of adults that reported a diagnosis of diabetes overall and by race/ethnicity from 2016 to 20 20, the most recent that surveillance data is available. In New Jersey, 9.2% of adults reported a diabetes diagnosis. This p ercentage was highest among Black, Non -Hispanics (1 4.7%), followed by Asian, Non -Hispanics (12.1%) and Hispanic/Latino (12. 4%), and lowest among White, Non - Hispanics (6.7%) ( Figure 61). A higher percentage of adults were diagnosed with diabetes in Hudson County (11.5%). Of note, whereas county rates among Black (14.1%) and White (6.9%) residents were comparable to those of the state , Latinos in Hudson County (13.5%) had higher rates and Asians had much lower rates (0.7%) than in New Jersey.

However, cancer incidence and mortality are close ly associated with the social determinants of health. Screening and early detection is a critical strategy to reduce premature deaths and is strongly li nked to access to care. Further, lifestyle factors are the most significant risks of developing cancer . Exposure to carcinogen s in the built environment , the water, the air, and the soil, because of daily activities at home , school , and the workplace , increases the risk of developing cancer . In addition, a healthy lifestyle - maintaining a healthy diet and weight, and not smoking or consum ing alcohol, are preventative factors ; as discussed in other sections of the report, some population groups face substantial barriers to sustaining a healthy lifestyle. 9.2%11.5%12.4% 0.7%14.7%14.1% 12.4%13.5% 6.7% 6.9% New Jersey Hudson CountyOverall Asian, Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic Hispanic/Latino White, Non-Hispanic \"We seem taken aback by how prevalent these chronic diseases are so much so that when somebody's first diagnosed , many times they don't even react to it like, \"Yeah , well, my father had it , my mother had it , my friends have it , and now I have it .\" It's normalized and I think that's a shame .

Across the state, the overall mortality per 100,000 was 1 41.1 and was highest among Black, Non -Hispanics (16 1.5 per 100,000) and White , Non-Hispanics (15 0.6 per 100,000) (Figure 62). The overall cancer mortality rate in Hudson County (121.1 per 100,000) was lower than in the state . Most racial/ethnic groups in Hudson County, had cancer mortality rate s comparable to those in New Jersey . However, Black residents' cancer mortality rate (182.9 per 100,000) in Hudson County , was higher than in New Jersey. Appendix I in the back of this report contains additional cancer data including incidence and mortality data and five -year trends for all cancers across New Jersey and Hudson Count y.

It is the most prevalen t disease in the grouping of chronic lower respiratory disease s (CLRD), the sixth leading cause of death in Hudson County in 20 20. Data are presented on the rate of emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations for COPD per 10,000 population at the state and county level from 201 6-2020. The state overall had a rate of 3, 299 ED visits and 9 39 hospitalizations per 10,000 population ( Figure 75). Hudson County had a rate of 3,477 ED visits, a rate higher than the state , and 925 hospitalizations per 10,000 population , slightly below the state - wide rate. DATA SOURCE: New Jersey Department of Health, Office of Health Care Quality Assessment, New Jersey Data Collection System, as reported by New Jersey State Health Assessment Data (NJSHAD), 2016 -2020 Disability Residents who have some type of disability may have difficu lty getting around, living independently, or completing self-care activities. Other disabilities, such as hearing impairment, vision impairment, and cognitive impairment, may also impact residents ' daily lives. Disabilities affec t people of all ages and are most prevalent among older adults. While the issue of disabilities did not emerge often in the qualitative interviews , many people with disabilities face economic instability as they rely on government financial assistance pr ograms for their basic needs . In New Jersey, the Divisions of Developmental Disabilities (DDD) and Disability Services' (DDS) provide support for individuals until they turn 21, and after individuals reach age 60, they can access resources from the Office of Aging and Disability. In addition, it is often challenging for parents of children with disabilities to navigate the education and healthcare system , particularly if they have limited English abilities . Even obtaining a diagnosis may be difficult . For middle and low -income residents, affording care for children with disabilities is also a barrier.

Hospitalizations due to COPD per 10,000, by State and County, 2016 -2020 \"It's called early intervention, where students are identified early . So, if they or the pediatrician notices that there's some developmental delays, we pick them up. We provide services from preschool on through 21 .\" - Key informant interviewee 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 83 expressed that there were supportive services for children with special needs starting in preschool to age 21. Howe ver, developmental delays are not always easy to diagnose . Further, there are insufficient special education teachers to meet the need. Data on the civilian noninstitutionalized population by age show that almost four percent of children under 18 years o ld (3.5%) , almost eight percent of 18-64-year -old adults (7.7%) , and 30.6% of people 65 or older had a disability in New Jersey in 2016 -2020 (Figure 76). At the county level, 3. 7% of children under 18 years old, 6.4% of 18-to-64-year -old adults, and 32.9% of adults 65 years of age and ol der had a disability in Hudson County. Bayonne had the highest proportion of children living with a disability (5.8%) in 2016 -2020 ; in Jersey City zip code 07304, almost 1 in 10 adults aged 18 -64 had a disability (9.1%); and in Union City more than 2 in 5 (40.7%) adults 65 and older were living with a disabili ty.

In the field, mental health and substance use are typically discussed under the larger framework of behavioral hea lth. Mental Health Mental health was identified as a top community health concern. The topic of mental health arose in almost all conversations conducted for this CHNA. Interviewees and focus group members noted that while mental health has been a longstanding health concern, the COVID -19 pandemic has made the issue more pressin g. In the words of a Latino focus group participant, \"The pandemic had an adverse effect on everyone \u2014children, teens, and adults \u2014and there have been many people affected psychologically.\" Job loss and economic pressures, virtual schooling, social isolation , and the uncertainty associated with the pandemic were all cited as contributors to increased stress, depression, and trauma among Hudson County residents. At the same time, gun violence has also taken a toll on individual and collective psyches . In addit ion, poor mental health is often co -morbid with chronic conditions, which are highly prevalent in the population. Among community survey respondents, mental health was the top community health issue with 3 0.9% of respondents identifying it as an area of concern, as noted previously in the Perceptions of Community Health section. Stigma and Access to M ental Health Care While mental health issues affected people of all ages, races, and genders, mental health for veterans , unhoused individuals, children and youth, seniors, trans persons, Latino residents, immigrants, and low - income adults were highlighted in the qualitative discussions. Focus group participants noted that anxiety and depression were prevalent in the community and mentioned several barriers to care. Participants highlighted stigma associated with mental health as a hindrance . Participants observed that many people affected by mental health did not recogniz e mental health as a medical condition, and this was particularly so among the foreign -born population , veterans , and Black residents . As a focus group participant and veteran described, \"We find that to be a problem, that our veterans don't ask for help, because they're so darn self-sufficient and a little stubborn.\" A key informant interview ee who self - identified as Black explained that for \"those of African descent, counseling was not something that we did.\" Mental Health and Economic Instability Poor mental health is closely associated with economic and housing instability , as described in the section on Employment . Focus group veteran participants expressed that not having employment that afforded them a living wage was a major cause of anxiety and depression. Latino residents in the focus groups shared stories about the challenges of losing their jobs, paying the rent, and feed ing their families. An advocate for the LGBTQ+ community described high levels of stress and depression among transgender residents due to unemployment. \"The first problem is getting people to recognize the need, it's a national problem, with the advertising that it 's okay to ask for help .\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 85 Mental Health and Trauma Trauma is defined as a person's emotional response to a distressing event or series of events, including experiencing or witnessing violence, abuse and neglect in childhood, and war, among others . A person can have a range of psychological and physical symptoms following trauma that can dramatically hinder well-being and daily functioning, and can, in severe case s, develop post -traumatic stress disorder. As described in detail in the section on Violence Prevention and Safety , communit ies of color have experienced an undue burden of multiple forms of intergenerational, childhood, and adult trauma . As noted earlier, violence and community safety was the top health priority for Black survey respondents. Survivors of violence face many barriers to accessing mental health care. Key informant interviewees explained that m any trauma survivors come from cultures and environments that stigmatize mental health conditions. Others experi ence economic barriers to accessing care. Focus group participants and interviewees highlighted the urgent need to provide trauma informed care and to expand access to counseling and allied services for persons recovering from trauma in Hudson County . A focus group participant described the dire situation of mothers o f gun violence victims , \"We met with a group of moms whose children were all impacted by gun violence where the child was lost or criminally involved, the moms decided to get together and suppo rt each other. I asked what they did and they said , \"We just gather and wait for the next support victim .\" These women were in trauma themselves, looking to help others but not able to help themselves .\" Since 2020, JCMC's Trauma Recovery Center, a national evidence -based model to treating survivors of violence , has address ed some of the need . The model is based on providing trauma -informed medical care to violence survivors, in addition to counseling to alleviat e trauma symptoms , and linkage to community resources to address survivors' most immediate needs, including relocation, employment, and housing support, among others. Mental Health and the COVID -19 Pandemic The COVID -19 pandemic had devastating consequences on mental health across many sectors of the population. The pandemic contributed to anxiety, depression, and stress. Partly due to fear of the virus and uncertainty , partly due to the financial impact, and partly due to isolation. Further, many community members lost loved ones due to COVID -19. I nterviewees who work ed with seniors talked about isolation and loneliness among older residents, which was harder during the pandemic when senior centers and other social outlets closed . Many residents noted that children and youth were particularly affected as schools closed and they were isolated from their friends and social environment. They indicated that this was compounded by parents' increased stress levels due to uncertainty and financial worries. Participants mentioned that y outh exposed to domestic violence were particularly affected by stay-at-home orders. Suicide ideation among teenagers was mentioned by sev eral participants. A public health official summed up the situation of young people during the pandemic, \"They weren't in school through the whole pandemic and, you know, perhaps they're at home with an alcoholic father, or abusive mother, or you know, or no one at all. I think the kids are suffering probably the most as a community.\" \"We need more services because people are not getting the help they need ...\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 86 Those working in the health sector talked about the mental health of their staff who have faced tremendous pressure when responding to the pandemic . As an interviewe e from public health described, \"[Mental health] is a problem, I think , especially after Covid ... We were all, you know, as a community , at home . Even me , I wasn't at work , but I was working from home you know, 24 /7, 7 days a week . So, I definitely think mental health is a big issue. .. You have to understand what it is to be doing that all the time .\" Reiterating the impact of the pandemic on mental health, 43.9% of survey respondents reported that they or someone in their family ha d personally experienced difficulty with maintaining a good mental state, while 3 5.1% reported being lonely or isolated from others since COVID -19 began ( Figure 77). More than half of Latino respondents (55.9%) reported that they or a family member had difficulty maintaining a good mental state during COVID -19, significantly more than Black (26.9%) and White (48.0%) respondents. Black respondents (23.1%) were the least likely of all race/ethnic groups to report being isolated. Figure 77.

The overall county rate was slightly higher than at state level (63.1 per 100,000 in Hudson County vs. 60.8 per 100,000 in New Jersey ) (Figure 80). The mental health -related hospitalization rate was highest among the Black population in both the state (94.6 per 100,000) and the county (107.1 per 100,000) , followed by White residents (61.5 per 100 ,000 in New Jersey and 66.9 per 100,000 in Hudson County ). County -level rates for mental health hospitalization of Latino and Asian residents were both lower in Hudson County than in New Jersey . Figure 80.

Rates among Asians were lower in the county than in the state , but higher among the other racial/ethnic groups . White reside nts had the highest suicide rate s in the county (10.5 per 100,000), nearly double those of Black (5.9 per 100,000) and Latino (5.2 per 100,000) residents (Figure 81). Figure 81.

First, even for residents who do seek help, they are not aware of where to obtain it. Second, participants noted that there were insufficient mental health service providers in Hudson County to meet the demand , particularly those that can provide culturally compe tent services to the diverse population, including gender non-binary people, non -English speakers, and veterans. This leads to long waiting times. As described by a focus group participant, \"From the behavioral health side, due to staff shortages and high demand, we've had to limit community referrals and take from within the hospital to treat the most acute clients. Those others who need mental health support, we don't have the bandwidth to help them right now.\" A health administrator described the e fforts made to hire culturally competent staff , \"Not only is it hard finding behavioral health staff, but we also try to mirror the staff we hire, bilingual staff are unicorns because they are hard to find.

JCMC and other pro viders began offering services via telehealth to expand access during the pandemic. However, whereas this strategy worked with certain groups, others without access to technology or with lower digital literacy, did not benefit . Participants mentioned that s chools often identify and connect students to mental health services, but school nurse and student support/counseling offices are understaffed. As one public school administrator expressed , \"We've been trying through the schools with our re sources to really embed more social, emotional, not just the mental health, but before it gets to the mental health , helping students overcome challenges , developing resilience , by b eing able to speak about their emotions .\" However, staffing is limited , as are the mental health services that schools can provide. Data are presented on the ratio of population to mental health providers in 2019. At the state level, there were 450 people for every mental health provider ( Figure 83). In Hudson County, the ratio was 1570 people for every mental health provider. The dearth of mental health providers in Hudson County likely worsened during the pandemic. Figure 83. Ratio of Population to Mental Health Providers, by State and County, 2019 DATA SOURCE: National Provider Identification Regi stry, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, as reported by County Health Rankings, University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2019 Substance Use Substance use was mentioned as a community health concern in conversation s this year, as it was in prior CHNAs. Problem s ubstance use was described as affecting all groups, across all socioeconomic levels . However, i t was mentioned specifically in conversations in the context of unhoused individuals, vete rans, and young people ; some reported that problem substance u se is more hidden among youth in higher income communities. Several participants reported that substance use, particularly alcohol and opioid use, has increased as a result of economic and socia l stressors . Further, overdose deaths among young people were also noted as a health concern. A healthcare provider remarked , \"I'll say for us the top conditions that we tend to get a lot of are readmissions for drug s overdose , heroin, opioids, and alcohol . And it's always the same people who keep coming a nd coming .\" Some participants mentioned substance use associated with safety concerns, particularly among youth who consume substances. A Latino resident provided the following example , \"When I wait for the bus, there are young people doing drugs or drinking alcohol nearby and that scares me a lot .\" Data for prevalence of s ubstance use , substance -use related mortality, and substance use treatment is presented in the sections below. 450:11570 :1 New Jersey Hudson County2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 91 Alcohol Use Focus group and interview participants discussed that they were concerned about alcohol consumption as a problem in the community , particularly given difficulty accessing long -term treatment services . Alcohol use is also a contributing factor t o other preva lent health conditions, including cardiovascular disease, depression , and violence . Data aggregated for 201 7 to 2020 show binge drinking levels - defined as a drinking pattern that brings blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 percent or higher , typically by consuming four or more drinks (female), or five or more drinks (male) in a two-hour period - for the state and county and by race/ethnicity. In New Jersey, 16. 9% of adults reported binge drinking. This percentage was highest among White (20.5%), followed by Latino (16.1%), Black (12. 6%), and Asian (8.8%) residents (Figure 84). At the county level, 1 7.6% of adults in Hudson County reported binge drinking, with the highest percentage among White (27.2%) residents , followed by Latino (15.8%), Black (11.9%), and Asian (8.1%) residents . Of driving deaths over the period 2015 -2019, 22.8% were due to drinking under the influence of alcohol in New Jersey, and 18.1% in Hudson County. Figure 84.

Others expressed concern about the long -term implications of marijuana legalization on substance use trends in the community. The following figure shows the age -adjusted drug poisoning mortality rate per 100,000 population in 2016 and 20 20. In New Jersey, the age -adjusted rate per 100,000 was 23.2 in 201 6 and 32. 1 in 20 20 (Figure 86). The Hudson County rates were lower than the state, with mortality rates per 100,000 at 14.0 in 201 6 and 21.6 in 20 20. Similar trends are also presented in Figure 87 for unintentional drug induced poisoning mortality per 100,000. Figure 86.

When looking at the percentage of adults who are current smokers, Figure 89 show s that in New Jersey, 1 1.8% of adults were current smok ers in 2017 -2020 . This percentage was highest among Black (14.4%) and Latino (14.2%) residents , followed by White (12.0%) and Asian (6.8%) residents . At the county level, 14.2% of residents reported currently smoking overall. Proportionally , more Black residents reported smoking (22.5%) compared to Latino (13.6%), Whit e (13.5%), and Asian (8.1%) adults in Hudson County . Of note, the proportion of Blac k Hudson County residents who smoked was markedly higher than the county average and of Black smokers in the state. Figure 89.

Participants advocated for more local programs, including community -based recovery programs. Several participants mentioned the problem of relapse due t o inadequate treatment programs. The disruption in mental health services due to the COVID -19 pandemic further increased the risk of relapse. As a health administrator noted, \"We can detox folks here, but we can't provide addictions treatment. We can detox people over and over again, and we do, that happens in substance abuse treatments, but not having a better solution to move from detox into a 21 -day program or something similar is a problem we've seen for years ... we need a seamless transition between \" the facilities, short -term, and long -term treatment programs . The following figure shows the percentage of substance use treatment admissions by primary drug in 2020. At the state level, 4 2.0% of admissions were for heroin, 31.0% for alcohol, and under 10% each for marijuana, cocaine, other opiates, and other drugs ( Figure 90). In the Hudson County treatment sites, 39.0% of admissions were for heroin, 26.0% for alcohol, 1 9.0% for marijuana, and under 10% each for other opiates, cocaine, and other drugs. Figure 90.

Environmental factors are various and far reaching and include exposure for hazardous substances in the ai r, water, soil , or food; natural disasters and climate change; and the built environment. Asthma Asthma in children was one of the conditions mentioned in the focus groups and interviews as a community problem and as a major cause of missed school days . Public health data typically show that 1 in 13 adults has asthma , and it disproportionately affects low -income communities and communities of color.30 Perceptions of asthma as a community problem are supported by quantitative data. Data are presente d on the rate of asthma hospitalizations per 100,000 population in 20 20. The following figure shows that the age-adjusted rate was 1 ,064 per 100,000 persons in New Jersey and 80 2 per 100,000 persons in Hudson County (Figure 92). 30 https://www.aafa.org/asthma -facts/ 23.0%27.0% Other, Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 96 DATA SOURCE: DATA SOURCE: New Jersey Discharge Data Collection System, Office of Health Care Quality Assessment, New Jersey Department of Health, New Jersey State Health Assessment Data (NJSHAD), 2018 and 2020 NOTE: Includes all asthma diagnoses, including primary, secondary, and other diagnoses.

At state and county levels , Black residents shared a disproportionate burden of asthma ED visits. State -wide, Black, Non-Hispanics had the highest rate of ED visits (89.0 per 10,000), followed by Hispanics/Latinos (32.3 per 10,000), White, Non -Hispanics (13.1 per 10,000), and Asian, Non -Hispanics (3.5 per 10,000 ). Trends in Hudson County were similar to those state -wide, albeit slightly lower for all race/ethnicities. The highest rate in Hudson County was among Black, Non -Hispanics (7 3.0 per 10,000), followed by Hispanics/Latinos (17.1 per 10,000), White, Non -Hispanics (11.4 per 10,000), and Asian, Non -Hispanics (3.3 per 10,000).

This is a decrease compared to ozone air quality from 2014 -2019 ; however, it is a possibility that COVID -19 impacted these rates as more people spent time indoors and less time traveling ( Figure 95). Data on air quality show a n average daily density of fine particulate of 9.3 micrograms per cubic meter in Hudson County, slightly higher than the state average (8.1) (Figure 96). Whereas air quality was not a n issue of frequent concern for most participants, a few did remark on vehicular traffic as a source of pollution , particularly in certain neighborhoods . 3.5 3.389.0 73.0 32.3 17.113.1 11.4 New Jersey Hudson CountyAsian, Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic Hispanic/Latino White, Non-Hispanic \"The New Jersey Turnpike extension ... is a constant construction hazard .

Exposure to lead among young children, through touching lead dust or paint chips , for example, can harm children's health, including potential damage to the brain and nervous system, slowed growth and development, and hearing and speech problems. As shown in Figure 97, most of the housing in Hudson County (68.4 %) was built prior to 1980 , which is a slightly higher percentage than in New Jersey (65.7%) . In 2022 , New Jersey released new state regulations mandating visual inspections of all rental units built prior to 1 978; however, a public health official noted the challenge of implementing such regulations given the number of older housing and the available human resources.

COVID -19 COVID -19 was not extensively discussed in conversations around infectious and communicable diseases. When it was addressed, focus group and interview participants primarily discussed how COVID -19 and the shutdown of businesses and schools had exacerbated the social and economic inequities that already existed. Participants noted that i ncome loss during COVID-19, coupled with inflation , was a major source of stress, anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. Parents of school children also had to face the challenges of remote schooling , and participants talked about the increase in mental health d isorders among children due to isolation. Participants associated the stress -related to COVID -19 on an increase in domestic violence cases. The socioeconomic impacts of COVID -19 were discussed extensively in prior sections (see , for example, the Inequality, Education, Employment and Workforce , and Income and Financial Security sections ). Additionally, many in the healthcare fields noted a significant disruption in access to services, particularly in preventive care. They remarked that patients we re afraid of seeking care and only did so for emergencies. Several focus group participants observed that COVID -19 had become normalized and were worried that people were not taking the proper precautions, such as masking, to prevent the spread of COVID -19. In terms of COVID -19 testing, there were diverse experiences; whereas some kn ew of free COVID -19 testing sites, others did not. For the latter, cost was a barrier to COVID -19 testing. Since April 2020 until September 2022 , there have been 2.3 million confirmed cases of COVID -19 in New Jersey and nearly 1 90,000 in Hudson County. Cases have fluctuated from January 2020 throughout 2022; notable peaks in cases per day across New Jersey include April 5, 2020 (>4,000 cases), January 4 , 2021 (>6,700 cases), and December 27 , 2021 ( >43,000 cases). Below, Figure 99 shows new confirmed cases per day per 100,000 population on the first of the month from March 202 2 through August 202 2. \"[COVID impacted] housing, food insecurity, jobs, people have a fear of going back to work, and childcare , because there was a time when everything was virtual, how can parents afford to stay home and put food on the table ?\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 101 Figure 99. New COVID -19 Cases per 100,000 pop ulation, by State and County, 2022 DATA SOURCE: New Jersey Department of Public Health, COVID -19 Dashboard, 202 2 According to data from the New Jersey Department of Public Health, a s of August 10, 2022, there were 31,27 5 deaths from COVID -19 in New Jersey and 2,546 in Hudson County. There are racial/ethnic disparities among COVID -19 deaths in New Jersey. While Black residents ma de up 12.4 % of the New Jersey population, they accounted for 1 6.6% of COVID -19 deaths in the state (Figure 100). Of note, 59.8 % of COVID -19 deaths occurred among White residents, even though they only make up 51. 9% of the population. This could potentially be due to the large numbers of White residents aged 65 and older, compared to other racial/ethnic groups . Figure 100. COVID -19 Confirmed Deaths, by Race/Ethnicity, by State, 2022 DATA SOURCE: New Jersey Department of Public Health, COVID -19 Dashboard, updated 8/29/2022 As of July 2 7, 202 2, about 6.8 million individuals in New Jersey ha d been fully vaccinated, representing around 76.5 % of the population ; Hudson County had reported over half a million fully vaccinated individuals , which is about 80.8 % of the population (Table 14).

Many participants also expressed concerns about shrinking reproductive rights with the recent overturn of Roe vs. Wade, and the negative impact that would have on women's health , particularly in terms of the inequitable burden o n low -income women . Participants reported increase s in incident HIV/AIDS cases during the pandemic and decreases in linkage to care for those persons living with HIV/AIDS. In addition, participants noted that the incidence of other ST Is, such as syphilis, had also increased since the pandemic . Limited knowledge related to free testing sites in the population was mentioned as a barrier to timely diagnosis and management. In addition, the cost of treatment , even for insured patients, was brought up as a challenge for middle -low and low -income residents. Another concern raised by participants was the increase in ST Is among young people. As part of the discussion, participants cited parents' lack of awareness of the problem, including in affluent neighborhoods as a main barrier to prevention . Participants raised the absence of comprehensive sexual ity education in schools as another impediment to safe sex . According to participants, comprehensive sexuality education provides critical information on healthy sexuality and reproduction and serves to empower adolescents to make choices regarding their health . As residents noted, access to information is of utmost importance in the current climate of curtailing legal prote ctions to reproductive choice . HIV transmission data was not available for the county but for the state overall. The rate of HIV transmission for Black residents in New Jersey was 30.2 per 100,000 persons, which was ten times the rate of transmission for White residents ( 3.1 per 100,000) and over three times the rate for all New Jersey residents ( 9.9 per 100,000) ( Figure 102). Hispanic/Latino residents had a n HIV transmission rate of 18.4 per 100,00 persons, almost two times greater than that of N ew Jersey residents. \"One thing we have to prevent HIV is PrEP, but we don't know if everyone knows we have it, or where to get tested for free, or even if they should get tested ... Clients who come in late have passed through areas of healthcare where they've not been tested, so access and education is something we need. \" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 104 Figure 102.

Crude rate. Maternal and Infant Health The health and well -being of mothers, infants, and children are important indicators of community health . Maternal and infant health indicators are considered markers of inequit y as most maternal and perinatal health complications are preventable with access to quality, adequate timely care. Whereas participants did not discuss issues related to maternity and newborn care, they did bring up multiple barriers to accessing care , which may have impeded or severely reduced access to this life saving intervention. 2609.5 209.662.12918.0 212.862.7 Chlamydia (females ages 15-24) Gonorrhea (under age 35) Hepatitis C (Acute & Chronic), 2020New Jersey Hudson County 5.39.815.416.5 2016 2021New Jersey Hudson County2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 106 Prenatal Care Prenatal care is an evidenced -based intervention to improve maternal and perinatal health outcomes. Statewide, nearly three in four births had prenatal care within the first trimester ( Figure 105). By race/ethnicity, White, Non -Hispanics (8 2.2%) had the highest percent receiving prenatal care, followed by Asian, Non -Hispanics ( 81.1%), Hispanics/Latinos (6 5.6%), and Black, Non -Hispanic s (60.2%). In Hudson County, 73.9 % of births received prenatal care in the first trimester. Similar to statewide trends, Hispanics/Latinos (6 8.4%) and Black, Non -Hispanics (6 1.2%) in Hudson County had the lowest access to prenatal care . Additional data on access to prenatal care are presented in Figure 131 in the Appendix. Figure 105.

Similarly, in 2020, 8.3% of births in Hudson County were low birthweight births , with Black, Non -Hispanics having the highest proportion of low birthweight births (1 3.0%). In Hudson County, 1.2% of births were very low birthweight (<1,500 grams) , with Black, Non -Hispanics (3.0%) having more than double the proportion of very low birthweight births , followed by Hispanics (1.6%) (See Figure 130 Non-Hispanic Hispanic/Latino White, Non-Hispanic2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 107 Figure 106.

Thus, it is a marker of health disparities. Across the state, the maternal mortality rate was 0.5 deaths per 100,000 population from 2015 to 2019 ( Figure 108). In line with other measures of infant and maternal health, Black, Non -Hispanics had the highest maternal mo rtality rate (1.2 deaths per 100,000), more than double the state -wide rate, with other racial/ethnic groups closer to the state -wide average. Two factors may have exacerbated disparities in maternal deaths in recent years : the COVID -19 pandemic , which is associated with an increased risk of maternal morbidity and mortality, and which disproportionately affected Black residents and curtailed access to safe abortion care .

The infant mortality rate among Black infants (9.3 per 1,000 births) was double to the state -wide rate (4.3 per 1,000 births) ( Table 15). Similarly, the infant mortality rate among Black infants (7.1 per 1,000 births) in Hudson County was 2.5 times the county rate (2.9 per 1,000 births) over the same period . Table 15.

It has long -term social and economic consequences, as often, pregnant teens drop out of school, curtailing futur e opportunities for education and employment, and perpetuating the cycle of poverty. While teen pregnancy was not discussed at length during the assessment conversations, p articipants did talk about how legal challenges and restrictions to safe abortion an d post -abortion care may severely curtail teen's ability to make reproductive choices. Data from the New Jersey Birth Certificate Database show the number of teen births per 1,000 female population from 201 4 to 20 20, by race/ethnicity. At the state level, the overall teen birth rate was 10.9 per 1,000 and the highest teen birth rate was among Hispanics/Latinos ( 25.0 per 1,000), followed by Black, Non -Hispanics (1 9.7 per 1,000). In Hudson County , the overall teen birth rate was higher than the state, 17 .2 per 1, 000 ( Figure 109). The highest teen birth rate in Hudson County was 27.3 per 1,000 among Black, Non -Hispanics, followed by Hispanics/Latinos (21.1 per 1,000). Figure 109.

Access to healthcare services is important for promoting and maintaining health, preventing and managing disease, and reducing the chance of premature death. Access and Utilization of Preventive Services, Including Immunizations Participants in the healthcare field unanimously noted a decline in access to preventive care in Hudson County during the pandemic . Some focus group and interview participants discussed delaying care, particularly routine preventive services, in recent yea rs. Reasons cited included the high cost of care , being uninsured, not having sick leave, not having providers that spoke their language, and/or not having childcare available. On the other hand, participants indicated that having a primary care provider and/ or access to a trusted FQHC were two factors that facilitated access to care. The community survey fielded in spring/summer 2021 asked respondents about their participation in various healthcare screenings, including prev entive services , in the past two years . Approximately 77% of Hudson County survey respondents reported receiving an annual physical exam ; 73% a vision screening; 68% a dental screening ; and approximately 7 4% a flu shot in the past two years. Fewer - 31% - reported having a hearing screening. Figure 110 presents these data for all Hudson County survey respondents and by race/ethnicity. \"Primary care is a big issue for [most ] of our children who have free and reduced meals . They live below the poverty line and they don't have a set primary care provider, pediatrician or doctor, and the y are not going for all the routine tests that children should get.\"- Key informant interviewee 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 111 Figure 110.

These patterns were confirmed by surveillance data. Among children in Hudso n County, surveillance data from 2017 -2018 indicate nearly 96% of children were fully immunized (Figure 111). However, 2019 data indicate that only 38 % of Fee- for-Service (FFS) Medicare enrollees reported having received an annual flu vaccination in Hudson County, compared to 51% in New Jersey over all (Figure 112). Further, only one in five (20.4%) of eligible Hudson County residents reported receiving a pneumonia vaccine in 2020 (Figure 113). Given the disruption of COVID -19 on access to care, current percentages may be lower. Figure 111.

High healthcare cost was the top barrier mentioned by residents , providers, and healthcare administrators . Other barriers identified through discussions were lack of insurance and/or insurance challe nges, scheduling convenience, long wait times, provider availability, stigma and discrimination, and language and cultural barriers. In addition, fear of institutions due to the increase in anti-immigrant discourse and persecution of undocumented individuals was cited as a major impediment for care access among this population. Many r esidents indicated that they only sought care from hospitals in an emergency; high and unpredictable cost of hospital care, trust, and unavailability of bilingual providers were some of the issues that made residents prefer to seek care from community -based clinics, FQHC s, or private practices . Participants also noted that d isruptions to the healthcare system due to the pandemic , e.g., temporary closures and retirement of older providers, further distanced residents from services. Barriers to healthcare access were discussed in multiple ways (e.g., survey, focus groups, interviews) and different issues emerged via the various methods. In the comm unity survey, respondents selected which barriers they ha d experienced from a list. Only 29.4 % of survey respondents indicated that they have never experienced any difficulty in getting healthcare. Overall, t he top issues selected were cost of care (32.4%) and ability to schedule an appointment at a convenient time (30.9%) (Figure 114). Differences emerged by race/ethnicity. White respondents were the most likely to report that they did not have an issue accessing care (34.9%) ; ability to schedule an appointment was marked by 53.5 % of Asian \"Preventive care is pretty much nonexistent. Most community members might not have primary care linkage, they often provide the name of a specialist when asked who their PCP is. There are a lot of gaps in terms of availability and being able to afford to see a PCP .\" - Focus group participant 24.7% 20.4% New Jersey Hudson County2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 114 respondents ; Black respondents were the most likely to note insurance problems (42.3%); and over 40% of Asian and Latino respondents marked cost of care as an issue (See Cost of Care section below) .

As described above, Latino (42.6%) and Asian (41.9%) respondents were more likely than White (23.6%) respondents to mark cost of care as a barrier (Figure 114). Many Black respondents also mentioned cost of care as a barrier (38.5%). This barrier existed for both preventive care and more complex care. Some p articipants noted that they were able to access free health screenings when offered by the city, hospitals or the FQHCs. However, others did not, and remarked on having to pay a fee for basic preventive services, including COVID -19 tests , as a disincentive . In the words of a Latina resident, \"They sent me a $400 bill for a mammogram, and I wasn't working. Later I learned that there are organizations that offer it for free.\" Even for insured individuals, the cost of medication and treatment of chronic diseas es, including diabetes and cancer, is unaffordable. Many patients are faced with the dilemma of paying for rent, food, or medicine. Cost of care is a barrier for low -income residents, overall, but an even greater barrier for undocumented residents, as they are not eligible to receive government insurance. Participants in the Latino focus groups described being particularly wary of going to the hospital because of the high cost of care and going only in emergencies. Numerous residents remarked that obtaining charity care is an onerous task and many remarked that they had been rejected . Cost of care is also a barrier for middle -low income families, as they do not qualify for Medicaid or other government programs, but t hey cannot afford to pay for the medical bills. Even veterans who are insured through the Veterans Administration complained of the hurdles of accessing care and of receiving high hospital bills if they had to seek services in a non -affiliated hospital. Health Insurance Several participants stated that lack of health insurance and insufficient coverage are barriers to accessing healthcare. Healthcare providers and administrators indicated that many patients were uninsured and had difficulty accessing care . Multiple participants noted that uninsured patients would rather seek care from private physicians , rather than the hospital, because they fear the hospital costs. As described by this resident, \"People that don't have insurance or a primary care doctor have to fin d a private physician. When I first arrived to this country and had a job that didn't offer insurance, I had to spend all day waiting to see the doctor. There were usually about 60 people waiting.\" Participants indicated that even with insurance, people f aced many challenges. As one person stated, \"The lack of accepting insurances [is a big problem] , not a lot places accept state insurance. They may not have the \"right state insurance\" according to some companies .\" Participants enrolled in Medicare were grateful to have this insurance, however, one participant mentioned the high copays and the high cost of medi cine without Part D. Census data indicate that health insurance coverage is still an issue for many Hudson County residents, although this varies by neighborhood . A higher percentage of the population in Hudson County was uninsured than in New Jersey (12.4% vs. 7.6%) (Figure 115). Only 2.7% of Hoboken residents were \"If you don't have a doctor who's caring, or for like, people who are on Medicaid and Medicare, it's difficult. Like the seniors who are on Medicare, they have to pay a copay.... If you don't have the Part D for prescriptions, you don't get a deal on the prescriptions. I think that's horrible, after working your whole life... .\" - Key informant interviewee 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 116 uninsured compared to 23.4% of Union City residents , and 14.8% of residents in Jersey City zip code 07304. More than one in ten residents are uninjured in Jersey City zip codes 07305, 07306, and 07 307. Percentage of the population with private health insurance can be found in Figure 132 in the Appendix . Figure 115. Percent Population Uninsured, by State, County, and Town, 2016 -2020 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 Children have greater access to primary care than their caregivers. Many children live in mixed immigration status households ; they qualify for free or low -cost state health insurance as U.S. citizens , but their parents do not . Children can also access primary care through school clinics . In 201 6-2020, 5.4% of children under age 19 were uninsured in Hudson County, less than half of the percentage of uninsured adults (12.4%) in the county , but higher than the state averag e (3.9 %) (Figure 116). No children were uninsured in Hoboken and Jersey City zip code 07310 according to the American Community Survey data , compared to 8.5% of children in Union City and 7.2% of children in Jers ey City zip code 07304.

As a result, patients waited months for an appointment and face d long wait times prior to the visit . Participants indicated a dearth of both primary care providers and specialists. Focus gro up participants in the healthcare field noted that it was difficult to hire and retain staff in communit y-based non-profit organizations . A major barrier w as inadequate compensation. Staff did not receive competitive salaries and benefits package s due to federal funding regulations, including salary caps , lack of sick leave, and temporary contracts . As a focus group participant described, \"We are all struggling with staff retention, providers, nurses, CMAs, everyone right now . It's almost like we can't afford them. No matter how much we pay people , they can be traveling nurses an d make way more. \" According to participants, sickness, s taff burnout , and safety concerns during the pandemic further exacerbated the situation. Another problem noted related to provider retention were the inadequate affordable childcare options for staff with children. Whereas offering appointments during work hours is a problem for clients without sick leave, it is difficult to staff the evening hours. As a focus grou p participant in the healthcare field explained, \"We couldn't extend hours with staff because they need to pick up their children. The policy of the daycare providers is if they aren't there by 6 , they call CPS. If we need to give late hours, Head Start sh ould be required to give late hours. \" Participants in the healthcare field remarked that not all communities were represented by the staff; whereas there were plenty of Indian providers who spoke multiple languages, this was not so for Spanish and other languages. As described about mental healthcare providers in the Mental Health section above , more general and specialty care providers are needed in Hudson County. Surveillance data from 2017 ind icate that Hudson County ha d fewer people per every primary care physician ( 1,950 :1) than New Jersey overall (1,190:1), indicating a smaller person to provider ratio ( Figure 117). The need is noted even more urgent ly with specialty care. For example, the ratio of persons per dentists in Hudson County was 1,590:1 in 2018, compared to 1,160 in New Jersey ( Figure 118). The pandemic has probably increased this ratio. Figure 117. Ratio of Population to Primary Care Physicians, by State and County, 2017 DATA SOURCE: American Medical Association, Area Health Resource File, as reported by County Health Rankings, University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2017 1,190 :11,950 :1 New Jersey Hudson County \"When we studied the data a few years ago, people didn't understand what we meant about the ratio of people to doctors, that was like 2400:1, there were also poor numbers for mental health , and I would guess that's gotten worse. \" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 118 Figure 118. Ratio of Population to Dentists, by State and County, 2018 DATA SOURCE: National Provider Identification file, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Area Health Resource File, as reported by County Health Rankings, University of Wisconsin Population He alth Institute, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2018 Language and Cultural Factors Related to Healthcare Access Participants in the healthcare and social service field noted using different strategies to bridge language and cultural barriers. Many sites, including the hospital and the health department, described having agreements with translation companies to provide telephonic support in any language. In addition, heal thcare partners in most settings develop and disseminate informational materials and provide signage in multiple languages. Staff at many of the healthcare sites are themselves bi - or multilingual speakers. From a cultural perspective, many of the health care institutions in the area hire local staff , wh o represent the community . This strategy goes a long way in building trust with community members and overcoming some of the wariness for hospitals . As one healthcare employee explained, \"Being born and raised here, I can say it's the diversity of who we are that makes us special. Also being residents of the area who can identify what the needs are and try to address them in our agencies as residents.\" Another strategy is finding cultural ambassadors or credible messengers that can be a go -between for the healthcare institutions and the community. In the view of some participants, this strategy is there on paper, but needs to be implemented more proactively. As explained by a parti cipant , \"For people who speak languages other than English, we need not just the commitment to having it there, but actively promoting it, so that influential voices in those communities serve as ambassadors to say, you know if you if you speak Hindi , there's somebody at the medical center for you , or if you speak Pashto .\" 1160 :11590 :1 New Jersey Hudson County \"In general , we see access problems for Latinos, partly language based, and I think I've seen it largely as reflective of the fact that any non -English outreach tends to be an afterthought and not an attempt to truly connect and promote to those communities .\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 119 Certain groups are more represented than others. Healthcare staff explained that good strides had been made in reaching the Black and the Hindi communit ies; however , reaching Latinos and other immigrants has been difficult ; further , more work is needed to increase trust in the Black community . An advocate highlighted the need for more racial equity training for healthcare providers, \"I've heard of horrific experiences because of being African American, healthcare providers don't unde rstand the pain of African American folk .\" When describing the healthcare workforce needed in Hudson County, an administrator described, \"It's not just culturally competent, it's a workforce that looks like the community and helps with institutional trust issues found in different populations but especially with low income, African American, immigrant, rural, blue collar, politically leaning communities. \" To complement this observation, several Latino residents described language as a barrier to accessing health at hospitals . One patient described this experience, \"They gave me a referral for an eye doctor, they made an appointment for a video call, but I couldn't attend the appointment because it's always only in English, nothing else . They need staff who are bilingual.\" Community -Based Organizations and Coalitions Hudson County was described as having substantial and strong social services. Community -based nonprofits were seen as mission -driven and committed to their clients. Partnerships between the community -based organizations, hospitals, schools , and the government were seen as a strength in Hudson County and critical to providing services to those in need . As described by a public health administrator, \"Overall, as a city and a group of health industry collaborators, I think the hospital, the FQHCs, and the Department of Health, we have always worked hand in hand to address the needs, we are also involved in an HIV ending committee, but also access to healthcare, specific and broad topics.\" As mentioned earlier in this report, participants also spoke about city- wide efforts such as HealthierJC , which have promoted prevention, identified and addressed public h ealth gaps, and coordinated efforts across public health, hospitals, and community -based nonprofits , as well engaged the business community. Residents and public health administrators uplifted the role of community -based nonprofits in bridging the gap to services for those most marginalized. Residents noted how staff at FQHCs went out of their way to address their physical, mental, and social needs, bein g their first stop for primary healthcare, regardless of immigration status . Many residents seek free screenings from non -profit groups serving the LGBTQ+, Asian, Latino, and African -American communities. Latino residents expressed trust in the FQHC staff and described getting support to obtain the social services they were eligible for. A community -based service administrator described their vision as an integral part of the community, \"We like that the community thinks of us as their go -to place , community health centers, sometimes generations of patients. Sometimes we see someone as a child now bringing their children to pediatrics, from birth to death.\" One limitation that participants noted about community -based groups w as their limited financial and human resources. Sustainability and dependence o n grant funding, that is, funding which is variable and \"From my experience, over 20 years, I feel that the greatest strength are the community -based organizations. We have a wide range of individuals who form different communities, even small grassroots community -based organizations, to engage people in healthy ways .\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 120 short -term , were mentioned as problems . When speaking about the importance of uplifting community - based partners, a healthc are administrat or noted, \" Most of the strengths we mentioned are double edged. There's a lot of organizations that aren't well resourced financially, they are trying to do some good work , but with no sustainable resources or capacity to expand. \" In part because of this, m ost partic ipants saw a role for a stronger coalition in Hudson County that includes well -resource d hospitals . Participants expressed that there was a lot of collaboration among government actors, hospitals, schools, and community -based organizations. They remarked that each partner complemented each other and collaborated well, as shown during the pandemic. Focus group participants indicated that there was continued room for growth in this area. Community Vision and Suggestions for the Future Focus group and interview participants were asked for their suggestions for addressing identified needs and their vision for the future. The following section summarizes and presents participants' recommendations for future consideration. Expanding and Strengthening Behavioral Health and Overall Healthcare Services Health as Human Right: \"It is urgent to have access to free, quality health care\" Almost unanimously , cost emerged as a primary barrier to health care access in qualitative discussion . Many residents indicated that healthcare should be free. Residents underscored the value of preventive care as a cost -effective intervention and urged partners to continue expandi ng access to these services. Participants also highlighted challenges with health insurance coverage. To address these barriers, residents recommended offering more free screenings , loosening the requirements to qualify for free and/or low -cost health insurance, and simplifying the charity care application . Participants also suggested making more efforts to \"meet people where they are ,\" through mobile clinics and education sessions based in different neighborhoods. Participants highlighted the c ommunity school model, entailing private -public partnerships between the education and healthcare sectors , and the community , as a promising initiative to promote the well -being of low-income families. Greater Accessibility and Availability of Behavioral Health Services Participants remarked on the difficulties faced by all groups, particularly Black, LGBTQ+, veterans, and young residents, to accessing quality, culturally competent mental health care . Participants highlighted the need for more mental health workers . Focus group participants and interviewees hoped to see more community -based ment al health services, including recovery programs that are affordable and accept all insurance types. They also advocated for more prevention education programs to address problem substance use in the community, especially among youth and veterans . Participants suggested providing more education to address the stigma that surrounds mental health among many cultural groups . The need for more language capacity within the behavioral health services field was also discussed , as well as training in caring for patients of different backgrounds, including LGBTQ + patients , and those who have experienced trauma , such as veterans . \"There is also a deficit related to location, both Newark and NYC have better developed social infrastructure, especially in nonprofit, philanthropic, and people -powered engagement. It's a challenge I've seen linked to our location .\" - Focus group participa nt 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 121 Sexual and Reproductive Health and Women's Health Focus group members and interviewees were concerned about the increase in sexually transmitted infections among some groups, including cisgender women and men -who -have -sex-with -men, and about the repercussions of the rollback in constitutional protections to reproductive choice. Several participants warned that access to sexual and reproductive health services could be curtailed, even if New Jersey has progressive reproductive health policies . They noted that this would unduly affect low- income women and communities of color , thus, exacerbating existing racial/ethnic and social i nequities in maternal and infant health. Some p articipants recommended being vigilant a bout reproductive health and rights protections to support the sexual and reproductive rights of all people in New Jersey. They also underscored the importance of offering comprehensive sexuality education in schools. Focusing on the Upstream Factors and the Social Determinants of Health Inequality Growing inequality emerged as an issue of concern among most focus groups an d interview participants . Residents noticed this in neighborhood -level differences in school resources, in safety, in employment opportunities, and in the built environment. Participants attributed growing inequality on policies that cater to residents in the highest social strata and expressed frustration at this 'tale of two cities .' Residents suggested that more progressive polices on taxation, employment, education budgets , and healthcare were needed to reverse this trend. Economic and Employment Opportunities Expanding economic opportunities, especially for low -income workers, Latino residents, veterans, LGBTQ + residents, particularly trans gender people , and violence survivors was suggested as a priority area by many assessment participants. Participants recommended improving initiatives to help those who face barriers to employment obtain jobs. Suggestions included incorporating more vocational training programs in high schools to facilitate transition into the workforce , and education and incentives for employers hiring veterans and trans gender and other LGBTQ + people. Additional proposals included supporting small business owners and providing expanded workforce protections (e.g., sick leave, improved wages , childcare ) for all workers, particularly those in healthcare . Built Environment Several issues emerged as concerns in the built envi ronment. One was overdevelopment leading to overpopulation and loss of green areas; the other was the focus on building luxury rentals, resulting in gentrification. Participants enjoyed Hudson County's varied public transportation options , its walkability , and its parks . They praised current community efforts to extend green areas supportive of healthy lifestyles. Residents also highlighted the need for redevelopment and urban planning in flood -prone area s to mitigate water damage as an important emergency preparedness strategy. \"My biggest wish for this community is that we don't have such an economically diverse community. If there's a way to really help the families with the lowest economic resources to really have more financial stability , that would be ideal .\" - Key informant interviewee 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 122 Housing Access to affordable housing in safe neighborhoods was among the most discussed issues in qualitative discussions. Residents expressed concern about inflation and high taxes, coupled with the lingering economic impact of the pandemic on housing affordability, impending evictions, and homelessness, and looked for initiatives to mitigate these challenges and the high cost of housing. Participants proposed earmark ing more affordable hous ing units in the new developments, including housing for veterans ; implement ing the existing rent control policies, which also apply to foreign -born residents regardless of immigration status ; and fomenting first-time buyers' subsidies as a promising initiative to address intergenerational poverty. Greater Engagement and Access to Existing Initiatives Access to Services and Community Outreach Interviewees and focus group participants observed that information about existing services and programs were not readily accessible to community members. They recommended more be done to raise awareness about existing programs . Participants suggested organizing more education and awareness building effort s both in person and virtually in different neighborhoods and in diffe rent languages on topics that most affect the community, including on managing diabetes and high blood pressure, and on recognizing the signs of stroke. Other suggestions to bridge access to health and social services included deploying mobile vans to othe r areas in the county ; expanding health clinics that offer care for free and/or at low-cost to both children and families, particularly local and school -based clinics ; and offering appointments outside of the regular workday . Some participants recommended developing a centralized list of health and social service programs and resources , similar to the mental health directory prepared by the Health Department (https://healthierjc.com/mental -health/ ), but for other conditions. Partnerships, Community Engagement, and Community Building Participants valued the robust partnerships established among multiple organizations and across sectors, including grassroots or ganizations, government, small businesses, social services agencies, and FQHCs , as exemplified by the Partnership for a HealthierJC . Participants suggested continu ing to deepen engagement and collaboration with trusted community -based organizations , such as those representing Asian, Latino , and LGBTQ+ residents, as partners in outreach and information sharing about community service s and programs. Several participant s stressed the importance of engaging faith -based organizations , especially given their reach and level of trust in the community. Other participants discussed the need to collaborate and hire credible messengers - respected community members - to build bri dges with the community. Participants underscored mor e community outreach, a strong plan to reengage the community , and invest ing in the community as strategic areas moving forward . \"Do more preventive family care, I think it would be very profitable for the state really because it's cheaper to prevent than to deal with .\" - Key informant interviewee 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 123 Key Themes and Conclusions Through a review of the secondary social, economic, and epidemiological data; a community survey; and discussions with community residents and stakeholders, this assessment report examines the current health status of Hudson County during an unprecedented time given economic volatility, the COVID -19 pandemic , and the national movement for racial justice . Several overarching themes emerged from this synthesis: Some residents are struggling with lack of employment and economic opportunities. In 2016 -2020 , unemployment rates across Hudson County ranged from 2.4 % in Jersey City zip code 07302 to 7.0% in Jersey City zip code 07305 and 9.2% in Jersey City zip code 07304 . The u nemployment rates map ped onto racial/ethnic groups; residents in zip code 07302 are predominantly White (40.1%) and Asian (32.2%), whereas over two -thirds of residents in zip codes 07304 and 07305 are Black and Latinos . More resources for career transitions and job training and technology were identified as critical to addressin g these disparities . Focus group participants highlighted the need for more support and employer incentives for veterans and LGBTQ + residents fac ing employment discrimination. Housing affordability is a main concern in Hudson County . Housing affordability was identified as a pressing concern, particularly for persons of color , veteran s, LGBTQ + persons, immigrants, and low - income residents. Participants expressed that too many luxury rentals were being built, instead of affordable housi ng for families. There are m any renters across the area . In New Jersey, 64.0% of housing units were owner occupied in 2016 -2020, in contrast to 32.4% in Hudson County . Home ownership ranged from 12.5% in Jersey City zip code 07310 to 40.6% in Bayonne. Disparities in housing cost burden exist within Hudson County. In Jersey City zip codes 07302 and in Hoboken, less than one in three owner -occupied and 44% of renter -occupied households reported high housing costs whereas 64.4% of owner -occupied and 66.5% of renter -occupied residences in Union City reported spending more than 25% of their income on housing costs. Qualitative discussions highlighted how veterans in Hudson County tend to work in low -wage jobs and often live in multigenerational housing. Housi ng availability was also cited by interviewees as an important barrier to break ing the cycle of violence. Relocation is one of the strategies used to prevent revictimization of community and domestic violence survivors. However, according to violence inter rupters, affordable housing options in low -crime neighborhoods are limited. Several focus group and interview participants mentioned the problem of homelessness in Hudson County communities and indicated that the shelters and temporary housing available we re insufficient to meet the need . Solutions proposed included earmarking more affordable housing units in the new developments ; extending first-time buyers' subsidies , particularly for persons of color; and renovating and repurposing abandoned homes for low-income families . Mental health was identified as a significant community health concern. Mental health was identified as a top community health concern, closely associated with economic instability and chronic conditions . Black residents faced a disproportionate mental health burden. The rate of mental health hospitalizations in 2020 was 70% higher among adult Black residents (107.1 per 100,000) than the Hudson County average (63.1 per 100,000) . Black children had 38% higher hospitalized rates for mental health conditions than the county rate (34.7 per 100,000 vs. 25.2 per 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 124 100,000 ). Residents mentioned stigma and low number s of culturally competent providers as the principal barriers to mental health care access . Residents viewed chronic conditions as prevalent and linked to the s ocial determinants of health . Diabetes and high blood pressure were discussed as prevalent in the community, especially among low-income residents and communities of color, and survey respondents indicated \"overweight/obesity\" was the second most common health issue in their community. However, focus group participants focused on the barriers to healthy living including affording hea lthy food s, cost medication , and having time to exercise and be outside. Educational opportunities were seen as an important driving factor for future success. A positive and supportive school environment is important to physical and mental wellbeing, as well as to future educational and professional opportunities . Health supports academic success. Schools play an important role in facilitating access to care and helping students stay healthy , and Hudson County public schools engage with communities in multiple ways to support students. However, some schools face challenges due to in sufficient resources. Inequities in school performance are confirmed by graduation rate data from different Hudson County districts. Whereas the high school graduation rate in the Hoboken Public School District was 93.6% in 2020 -2021, the public school districts of Bayonne, Union City, and Jersey City had lower graduation rates. There were significant disparities by race/ethnicity withi n districts; 95.3% of Asian students graduated from high school in Bayonne in 2020 -2021, compared to 86.4% of Black children, and 78.5% of Latino children. Partnership based p rograms such as the community schools and The Tiger's Den at Snyder High School are a promising strategy to equalize outcomes among diverse students. Hudson County has a wealth of social service organizations and health care services, including those providing preventive care, though many residents experience barriers to accessing the se resources. Residents remarked that having a primary care doctor and being linked to a FQHC as facilitating factors to accessing care. They also discussed the importance of culturally competent providers , including providers who spoke their language and looked like them . Veterans and those working with violence survivors highlighted that having peers and mentors who could provide trauma informed care helped to be engaged in care . The high healthcare cost was the top barrier mentioned by residents, providers, and healthcare administrators . Participants in the healthcare field unanimously noted a decline in access to preventive care and mentioned this as a priority strategic area . They uplifted partnerships and community engagem ent as ways to bridge the care gap. Prioritization Process and Priorities Selected for Planning Prioritization allows hospitals, organizations, and coalitions to target and align resources, leverage efforts, and focus on achievable goals and strategies for addressing community needs. Priorities for this process were identified by examining data and themes from the CHNA findings utilizing a systematic, engaged approach. This section describes the process and outcomes of the prioritization proce ss. Criteria for Prioritization A set of criteria were used to determine the priority issues for action. The RWJBH Systemwide CHNA Steering Committee put forth the following criteria to guide prioritization processes across the RWJBH system. 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 125 Prioritizat ion Criteria Burden : How much does this issue affect health in the community? Equity : Will addressing this issue substantially benefit those most in need? Impact : Can working on this issue achieve both short -term and long -term changes? Is there an opportunity to enhance access/accessibility? Systems Change : Is there an opportunity to focus on/implement strategies that address policy, systems, and environmental change? Feasibility : Can we take steps to address this issue, given the current infrastru cture, capacity, and political will? Collaboration/Critical Mass : Are existing groups across sectors already working on or willing to work on this issue together? Significance to Community : Was this issue identified as a top need by a significant number of community members? Prioritization Process The prioritization process was multifaceted and aimed to be inclusive, participatory, and data -driven. Step 1: Input from Community Members and Stakeholders via Primary Data Collection During each step of the p rimary data collection phase of the CHNA, assessment participants were asked for input. Key informant interviewees and focus group participants were asked about the most pressing concerns in their communities and the three highest priority issues for futur e action and investment (see Key Informant Interview and Focus Group Guides in the Appendices). Community survey respondents were also asked to select up to four of the most important issues for future action in their communities, noted in the Community He alth Issues section of the CHNA Report. Based on responses gathered from key informant interviews, focus group participants, and community survey respondents, as well as social, economic, and health data from surveillance systems, ten initial issue areas were identified for Hudson County (listed below in no particular order) : Financial Insecurity Unemployment Food Insecurity Housing Chronic Diseases (e.g., heart disease, cancer, diabetes) Infectious Diseases, including COVID -19 Violence Prevention & Safety Mental Health Substance Use Access to Preventive Care Step 2: Data -Informed Voting via a Prioritization Meeting On October 2 7, 2022, a 90 -minute virtual community meeting was held with the RWJBH Jersey City/Hudson County CHNA Advisory Committee (see Appendix A for members), so Advisory Committee members could discuss and vote on preliminary priorities for action. During the virt ual prioritization meeting on Zoom, attendees heard a brief data presentation on the key findings from the CHNAs conducted across Hudson County. 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 126 Next, meeting participants were divided into small groups to reflect on and discuss the data and offer their perspectives and feedback on the various issues. Meeting participants then shared information from their discussions with the full group. At the end of the meeting, using Zoom's polling tool, participants were asked to vote for up to four of the ten prio rities identified from the data and based on the specific prioritization criteria (Burden, Equity, Impact, Systems Change, Feasibility, Collaboration/Critical Mass, and Significance to Community). A total of thirty -two Advisory Committee members voted duri ng the Community Prioritization Meeting. In addition, polling remained open for an additional week to gather responses from those who were not able to attend the meeting. An additional six responses were received during this period. Voting ranked the following issues as top priorities, with mental health receiving the highest percentage of responses. Percentage Vote #s Mental Health 74% 28/38 Housing 19/38 Violence Prevention & Safety 42% 16/38 Access to Preventive 5% 2/38 After a prioritization process with the Advisory Committee and discussions within the hospital taking into consideration existing expertise, capacity, and experience, JCMC will focus on Access to Preventive Care; Chronic Disease Management, including Behav ioral Health Services; Food Insecurity and Education; and Violence Prevention and Safety as priorities during the development of its implementation plan in 2023. JCMC will tackle these priority action areas as part of ongoing community engagement efforts a nd with an overarching emphasis on addressing systemic racism, racial injustice, and discrimination .2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 127 APPENDICES Appendix A - RWJBH Jersey City/Hudson County CHNA Advisory Committee Members Deborah Almonte, Jersey City Medical Center Jenny Andrews, Jersey City Medical Center Maureen Archibald, Jersey City Medical Center Tara Artesi, Legal Assistance to Medical Patients (LAMP) Project Adrienne Austin, Jersey City Medical Center Pamela Baker, Collaborative Support Programs (CSPNJ) Rakel Barri entos, Jersey City Medical Center Patrick Beaty, MD, Metropolitan Family Health Network Paul Bellan -Boyer , Jersey City Department of Health and Human Services Christina Bishop -Feeny, Jersey City Medical Center Sheridan Blackwell, Jersey City Medical Cente r Kimberly Blackwell, Jersey City Medical Center Whitney Bracco, Jersey City Medical Center Jenna Camacho, Jersey City Medical Center Scott Carey, Metropolitan Family Health Network Kristin Carlino, Jersey City Medical Center Kristy Case, Jersey City Med ical Center Suzanne Cavanaugh, City of Bayonne Ritu Chandak, Jersey City Medical Center Jamie Chebra, Jersey City Medical Center Jessica Chung, Jersey City Medical Center Timothy Daniels, Jersey City Medical Center Christine Dimaculangan, Jersey City Medical Center Cheryl Dorn, Peace Care Joan Dublin, Metropolitan Family Health Network Mark Duda, Visiting Nurse Association Health Group Leah Dungee, Jersey City Medical Cen ter Joan Eccleston , Jersey City Department of Health and Human Services Edoardo Ferrante, City of Bayonne Marissa Fisher, Jersey City Medical Center Stacey Flanagan, Jersey City Department of Health and Human Services Juliet Foster , Division of Veterans A ffairs, Jersey City Department of Health and Human Services Katherine Fromm, Jersey City Medical Center Marli Gelfand, Jersey City Medical Center Silvana Gomez, Jersey City Medical Center Stephanie Gonzalez , Jersey City Medical Center William Gonzalez, Jersey City Medical Center Kwaku Gyekye, Jersey City Medical Center Tina Harvey, Jersey City Medical Center Victoria Hayes, York Street Project 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 128 Angelo Hunt, St. Lucy's Shelter Linda Ivory -Green , Jersey City De partment of Health and Human Services Maryanne Kelleher , Jersey City Department of Health and Human Services Surendra Khera, MD, Jersey City Medical Center Kenneth King, Jersey City Medical Center Rita Knause, MD, North Hudson Community Action Corporation Jordan Kowalczewski, Barnabas Health Medical Group Theresa Laflam, Jersey City Medical Center Mabel Laforgia, Jersey City Medical Center Judy Lagani, Lincoln High School and Dickinson High School Maria Veronica Lavarro, Jersey City Medical C enter Michael Loftus, Jersey City Medical Center Mike McLean , Jersey City Department of Health and Human Services Janet Merly -Liranzo, Peace Care St. Ann's Susan Milan, Garden State Episcopal Community Development Corporation Stephanie Mills, Hudson Pride Stacie Newton, Jersey City Medical Center Tri Nguyen, Jersey City Medical Center Michele O'Reilly, City of Bayonne - Health Division Maria Otadoy, Jersey City Medical Center Lashawn Overton, Jersey City Medical Center Grace Palmer, Jersey City Medical Center Alicia Parker, Hyacinth AIDS Foundation Leo Pellegrini, Health & Human Services of Hoboken Joan Quigley, North Hudson Community Action Corporation Tara Reid, Jersey City Medical Center Jeffery Rodriguez, Jersey City Medical Center Elizabeth Schedl, Hudson Pride Aniello Semioli, Jersey City Medical Center Jessica Semioli, Jersey City Medical Center Thomas Sheehy, Peace Care St. Joseph's Tina Siciliano, Jotham W.

The purpose of the CHNA was to identify and analyze community health needs and assets and prioritize those needs to inform strategies to improve commun ity health. This assessment focused on the following Hudson County areas: Bayonne, Hoboken 07310), and Union City . Context This CHNA was conducted during an unprecedented period due to the COVID -19 pandemic and the national movement for racial justice. The COVID -19 pandemic impacted both the CHNA data collection process, as well as topics and concerns that residents raised in focus groups and key informant interviews. A wave of national prot ests for racial equity in 2020 highlighted how racism is embedded in systems across the US. The national movement informed the content of this report including the data collection processes, design of data collection instruments, and the input that was shared during focus groups, key informant interviews, and through survey responses. Methods While this CHNA aimed to be comprehensive, its data collection approach focused on the social and economic upstream issues that affect a community's health. Data coll ection was conducted using a social determinants of health framework and a health equity lens. The CHNA process utilized a mixed - methods, participatory approach that engaged agencies, organizations, and community residents through different avenues. The CH NA process was guided by the strategic leadership of the RWJBH Systemwide CHNA Steering Committee, the JCMC Community Outreach & Social Impact Steering Committee , the JCMC/Hudson County CHNA Advisory Committee, and the community overall. Data collection m ethods included: Reviewing existing social, economic, and health data in the JCMC primary and secondary service area s in Hudson County . Conducting a community survey with 273 residents d esigned and administered by Bruno & Ridgway. Facilitating 6 virtual focus groups with 1 05 participants from populations of interest, including veterans, and residents who identified as Black , Asian, and Latino, the latter held in Spanish . Conducting 7 key informant interviews with 12 community stakeholders from a range of sectors. Facilitating a guided discussion with the JCMC Community Outreach & Social Impact Steering Committee. Jersey City Medical Center /Hudson County CHNA Focus Area 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment ii Findings The following provides a brief overview of the key findings that emerged from this assessment: Population Characteristics Demographics. In 2020, Hudson County was the fourth most populous county in New Jersey with 671,923 residents. Its population increased by 1.4% between 2015 and 202 0.1 Participant s in focus group and interview discussions valued Hudson County's racial/ ethnic and language diversit y and robust foreign -born population . Residents identifying as Latino ma de up 40.4% of the county's residents , followed by those identifying as White (28.5%), Asian (17.0%), and Black (9.8%).2 In 2016 - 2020, the foreign -born population ranged from 19.4% in Hoboken to 62.8% in Jersey City zip code 0731 0, with many residents from India and the Dominican Republi c.3 Veterans ma de up about 2% of the Hudson County population , with the highest percentage in the city of Bayonne (3.9% ). Community Social and Economic Environment Community Strengths and Assets. Interviewees and focus group participants mentioned numerous positive aspects of their communities, including an abundance of resources and amenities, community solidarity , and robust partnerships , made stronger during COVID -19. Top strengths identified b y community survey respondents in 2021 include d that it was easy to find fresh produce and that their communities had safe outdoor places to walk and play. Nearly 60% of respondents indicated that their communities were a good place to raise a family and h ad places for everyone to socialize.4 Education. Graduation rates across Hudson County school districts differed, with Bayonne , Union City, and Jersey City experiencing lower graduation rates than the other communities and the state. There were racial/ethnic disparities in graduation rates , with Black and Latino students experiencing lower graduation rates than their White and Asian counterparts.5 Particip ants identified \"Community schools \" and Tiger's Den at Snyder High School, resulting from a partnership between the Jersey City Board of Education , JCMC, educators, families, and the communit y, as promising initiatives to address the needs of low -income st udents of color and increas e graduation rates . Inequality . Growing inequality was a recurrent theme in focus groups and interviews with participants describing the area as \"a tale of two cities .\" Development was seen as focusing on the wealthy, while r esidents emphasized how neighborhood concentrated poverty compounded the effect of household poverty . They highlight ed the linkage between income, hopelessness, poor education outcomes , and violence. Inequality was reflected in education, employment and workforce, income and financial security, access to healthcare, and other areas . 1 U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2011 -2015 and 2016 -2020 2 U.S. Census Bureau, Decennial Census of Population and Housing, 2020 3 U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 4 Community Health Needs Assessment Survey Data, Bruno & Ridgway, 2021 5 New Jersey Department of Education, School Performance, Adjusted Cohort Gradua tion Rates, 2020 -21 \"There is something going on almost every week to help with food, home purchases, and other things. T hat's one of the things I really love about Jersey City.\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment iii Employment and Workforce. Unemployment rates in Hudson County were trending downward over the decade prior to the COVID -19 pandemic and rose substantially in 2020 , similar to the rest of the state and country . While rates declined in 2021, unemployment has not yet fallen to pre -pandemic levels. Unemployment rates in 2016-2020 ranged from 2.4% in Jersey City zip code 07302 to 7.0% in Jersey City zip code 07305 and 9.2% in Jersey City zip code 07304 .6 Fewer than four in ten survey respondents agreed that \"there are job opportunities in my area.\" Participants indicated that LGBTQ+ populations, veterans, and essential workers were the most affected by unemploymen t and underemployment. Income and Financial Security . Median household income in Hudson County showed stark disparities , ranging from $49,457 in Union City, with a majority Latino population , to $153,438 in Hoboken, a predominantly White area.7 In 2019, 29.8% of Black children and 23.4% of Latino children lived in poverty , compared to 9.8% in the county overall .8 Among veterans, 7.5% lived below the poverty line in the county overall , with 21.4% doing so in Jersey City zip code 07306 .9 Focus group participants shared the day -to-day challenges of affording housing , food, and healthcare as prices continue to climb across the board . While the rising cost of living affects everyone, participants shared that it has been most painful for low -wage workers and those on fixed incomes, such as seniors. Food Access and Food Security. Participants mentioned that many families with children - often immigrants -, older adults , and those who were housing insecure were struggling to put food, particularly healthy food, on the table. Residents reported that food insecurity increased during the COVID -19 pandemic, despite stepping up food distribution efforts. Around one in four survey respondents overall, and about one in three Latino respondents, indicated that they relied on food pantries or othe r food assistance programs.10 Housing. Participants reported that affordable housing in their communities was sparse and difficult to obtain. Residents discussed the challenges of qualifying for affordable housing, rising rents due to an influx of New York ers, increasing socioeconomic segregation , and homelessness. More than half of renter -occupied households in Hudson County spend 25% or more of their monthly inc ome on housing costs , ranging from 39. 0% in Jersey City zip code 07302 to 66.5% in Union City and 64.6% in Jersey City zip code 07305 .11 6 U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 7 U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 8 U.S. Census Bureau, Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates, as reported by County Health Rankings, University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2019 9 U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 10 DATA SOURCE: Community Health Needs Assessment Survey Data, Brun o & Ridgway, 2021 11 U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 Percent Population Food Insecure, by State 8.6%11.1% 12.0%15.5% New Jersey Hudson County2019 2020 Feeding America, Map the Meal Gap 2021 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment iv Transportation. Participants valued the ample availability of public t ransportation options in Hudson County. Most participants indicate d that they were not car dependent and noted that it was easy to get around. In addition, participants indicated that the partnership s between health care facilities and private transportation companies facilita ted access to health care for older adults , persons with disabilities, and violence survivors. Green Space and Built Environment. Multiple residents expressed their concerns that there were too many new constructions , result ing in overpopulation and a shrinkage of green space. Participants highlighted the importance of emergency preparedness for flood ing and mentioned that mitigating redevelopment projects were underway. Residents also noted the contribution of grassroots organizations to public park maintenance , also important for increased water absorption. About 70% of Hudson County survey respondents agreed or completely agreed with the statement, \"My community has safe outdoor places to walk and play.\"12 Violence Prevention and Safety . Similar t o the 2019 CHNA, for many, violence prevention and safety continue to be priority issues for many residents. Participants shared differing views about safety and violence. Many indicated being safe in their neighborhoods, while others reported being nervou s about crime . In 2020, Jersey City (432 per 100,000 residents) had more than double the violent crime rate (i.e., murder, rape, aggravated assault) than the state average (195 per 100,000 residents).13 Black residents indicated that they experienced a disproportionate burden of violence, including gun violence, and trauma, with Black survey respondents' marking violence/community safety as the top health priority.14 Key informant interviewees indicated that Jersey City has robust programs and resources to address and mitigate the impact of violence and trauma , including the Anti-Violence Coalition and Project H.U.D.S.O.N . According to interviewees, promising results to interrupt the cycle of violence have been achieved by reaching survivors soon after injury and providing trauma -informed intensive case management and wraparound services, including safe housing and vocational training, in addition to medical care and counseling. Systemic Racism and Discrimination. With few exceptions, participants spoke of pervasive inequities experienced by people of different groups. Residents discussed the multiplying effect of historical and current discriminatory practices due to multiple conditions, such as race/ethnicity, gender, immigrant status, and socioe conomic status, among others. Participants noted these issues largely impacted communities of color because of the policies and practices embedded throughout society. Residents mentioned that some Hudson County municipalities have put in place programs to address the effects of systemic racism, such as first -time homeowner programs for low -income residents, rent control policies, and programs to promote minority and/or wom en owned business. However, participants emphasized that more are needed. 12 Community Health Needs Assessment Survey Data, Bruno & Ridgway, 2021 13 State of New Jersey, Department of Law and Public Safety, Uniform Crime Reporting Unit, 2019 14 Community Health Needs Assessment Survey Data, Bruno & Ridgway, 2021 \"The undocumented are scared to ask for help, and we are seeing that community getting jumped overnight, not wanting to go to the hospital over what they will get charged. \"- Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment v Community H ealth Issues Perceptions of Community Health. Focus group participants and interviewees identified social and economic issues such as financial insecurity, housing, and transportation as top community concerns, noting that these issues affect other aspects of health. Participants also discussed challenges in accessing care, the increase in mental health concerns, and the lingering effects of the COVID -19 pandemic. Community survey respondents ranked mental health, overweight/obesity, high stress lifestyle, affordable housing , and affordable eldercare as the top five health concerns in the community . Leading Causes of Death and Premature Mortality. Heart disease, COVID -19, and cancer were the top three leading causes of death in Hudson County in 2020. In 2018 -2020, Black residents experienced higher rates of premature mortality (deaths before age 75) than any other racial/ethnic groups.15 Obesity, Healthy Eating, and Physical Activity. While overweight/obesity was identified as the second top health concern (after mental health) by community survey respondents,16 it was not a prominent theme in conversations with residents . Participants mentioned disparities in the availability and affordability of healthy foods by neighborhood, with some areas considered food deserts. Some residents indicated enjoying the area's walkability , while others noted safety issues , sidewalks in dis repair , and time constraints as barriers to physical activity . Chronic Diseases . Like findings from the 2019 CHNA , chronic diseases continue to be a top community concern. Data show racial/ethnic disparities in chronic disease burden across Hudson County. Black residents experienced higher cardiovascular disease mortality rates than other racial/ethnic groups in the county. Diabetes was a top priority concern and participant s indicated that it was highly prevalent in their communities. The cancer mortality rate in Hudson County was highest among Black (182.9 per 100,000) , followed by White (148.5 per 100,000) , residents.17 In terms of chronic disease screenings, 70% of community survey respondents indicated that they had participated in a cholesterol screening, and nearly 8 7% had participated in a blood pressure screening in the past two years.18 Many participants mentioned health care costs as a barrier to chronic disease management. Disability. While the issue of disabilities did not emerge often in the qualitative discussions , many people with disabilities face economic instability as they rely on government financial ass istance programs for their basic needs. A key informant interviewee highlighted the importance of early intervention to address the needs of children with disabilities.

Echoing the 2019 CHNA, m ental health disorders were the top health priority selected by survey respondents and a prominent theme in interviews and focus groups. Job loss and economic pressures and the uncertainty associated with the pandemic were cited as contributors to increased stress and depression by Hudson County residents , including among veterans and member s of the LGBTQ+ community . Participants indicated stigma , long wait times for appointments, and unavailability of multilingual mental health care providers as barriers to accessing care. Several participants identified substance misuse , relapse, and overdose deaths among young people as a further health concern in the aftermath of COVID -19, with the drug poisoning rate increasing from 2016 to 2020.20 Environmental Health. The rate of age -adjusted ED visits for asthma declined in Hudson County from 201 8-2020.21 It should be noted that this decline may be due to individuals with asthma being reluctant to seek care during the height of the COVID -19 pandemic. The proportion of children born in 2014 who were tested for lead exposure before 36 months of age is higher in Hudson Count y (77.6%) than in the state (74.4%) .22 Communicable Disease s. Conversations related to COVID -19 primarily focused on how the pandemic exacerbated existing social and economic inequities . Several participa nts were concerned by the increasing rates of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV and chlamydia , among women of color and the LGBTQ+ population . The rate of HIV transmission for Black New Jersey residents was 30.2 per 100,000 persons, ten times higher th an among White residents (3.1 per 100,000). Nearly 3,000 per 100,000 women aged 15-24 contract 19 U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 20 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, Underlying Cause of Death 1999 -2020 on CDC WONDER Online Database, 2016 and 2020 21 New Jersey Discharge Data Collection System, Office of Health Care Quality Assessment, New Jersey Department of Health, New Jersey State Health Assessment Data (NJSHAD), 2018 and 2020 22 New Jersey Birth Certificate Database, Office of Vital Statistics and Registry; Child Health Program, Family Health Services, as reported by, New Jersey Department of Health, New Jersey State Health Assessment Data (NJSHAD), 2022 Population to Mental Health Provider Ratios , by State and County, 2019 450:11570 :1 New Jersey Hudson County DATA SOURCE: National Provider Identification Registry, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \"[COVID impacted] housing, food insecurity, jobs, people have a fear of going back to work, and childcare, because there was a time when everything was virtual, how can parents afford to stay home and put food on the table ?\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment vii chlamydia annually in Hudson County.23 Participants also expressed concerns about the roll -back of reproductive rights and the negative impact that would have on women's health, noting the inequitable burden on low -income women. Maternal and Infant Health. Maternal and infant health indicators are markers of inequity as most maternal and perinatal health complications ar e preventable with access to quality, adequate , timely care and information, including comprehensive sexual ity education . In Hudson County, a lower percentage of Black and Latino residents sought prenatal care in the first trimester compared to Asian and W hite residents. The rates of low birth weight and preterm births among infants born to Black residents roughly double d those of White residents ,24 indicating health care access barriers. Access to Services Access to Preventive Services. Participants reported that access to routine screenings and preventive care declined since the onset of the COVID -19 pandemic , despite the efforts of many partners. Participants indicated that having a primary care provider and/or access to a trusted FQHC facilitated access to care. Approximately 77% of community survey respondents reported having an annual physical exam and 74% a flu shot in the last two years.25 Access to Primary C are Services. Cost, workforce capacity, insurance, and language and cultural factors were most often mentioned by focus group and interview participants as barriers to accessing primary care. Community survey respondents indicated ability to schedule an appointment at a convenient time, insurance problems, cost of car e, and wait times as the main barriers to care.26 About 30% of respondents indicated never experiencing barriers. Within the JCMC service area, the proportion of uninsured residents was highest in Union City (23.4%) and lowest in Hoboken (2.7%) .27 Some p articipants, particularly veterans, mentioned experiencing disruptions in access to mental health services during the pandemic , including to support groups and counseling, leading to treatment setbacks and substance use relapse . Community -Based Organizations and Coalitions . Partnerships between the community -based organizations, hospitals, schools , and the government were seen as a strength in Hudson County and critical to providing services to those in need. City-wide efforts such as HealthierJC have been important to coordinate efforts across multiple partners, including the business community. Residents and public health administrators uplifted the role of community -based nonprofits in bridging the gap to services for those most marginalized. Most participants saw a promising role for a strong and broad coalition in Hudson County. 23 Communicable Disease Reporting and Surveillance System, New Jersey Department of Health, as reported by the New Jersey State Health Assessment Data (NJSHAD), 2020 & 2021 24 New Jersey Birth Certificate Database, Office of Vital Statistics and Registry, New Jersey Department of Health, New Jersey State Health Assessment Data (NJSHAD), 2015 -2019 25 Community Health Needs Assessment Survey Data, Bruno & Ridgway, 2021 26 Community Health Needs Assessment Survey Data, Bruno & Ridgway, 2021 27 U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 \"We have great partners. Hudson County is very tight, so we all work together - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment viii Community Visio n and Suggestions for the Future Health as Human Right: \"It is urgent to have access to free, quality health care .\" To overcome cost barriers, p articipants recommended expanding access to free or low-cost preventive care ; loosening the requirements to qualify for free and/or low -cost health insurance ; and simplifying the charity care application , including for those who are foreign -born . They also suggested \"meeting people where they are\" by using mobile and school -based clinics , organizing education sessions in all neighborhoods , and offering appointments outside of the regular workday . Participants highlighted the community school model as a promising initiative to promote the well -being of low -income families . Improving Access to Services and Community Outreach . Echoing 2019 CHNA priorities, many community participants emphasized improving access to primary care as a priority for the coming years . Numerous interviewees and focus group participants noted the need for better communication about existing programs and services. Participants suggested organizing informational sessions in different neighborhoods and languages on topics that affect the com munity, such as chronic disease management , and developing a centralized list of programs and resources, similar to the mental health directory prepared by the Health Department (https://healthierjc.co m/mental -health/ ), but for other conditions. Greater Accessibility and Availability of Behavioral Health Services . Participants suggested that expanding culturally -competent trauma -informed mental hea lth care , particularly for Black, LGBTQ+, veterans, violence survivors, and young residents, should be a priority in the coming years . They recommended diversifying the mental health work force , expanding community -based affordable mental health services, increasing long -term treatm ent and maintenance options for persons with substance use disorders, and developing additional prevention education programs to destigmatize mental health disorders among many cultural groups. Sexual and Reproductive Health and Women's Health . Participants underscored the importance of offering comprehensive sexuality education in schools to reduce sexually transmitted infections and reduce unplanned pregnancies among teens ; increasing access to information and reproductive health commodities to address the rise in sexually transmitted infections among cisgender women and men -who -have -sex-with -men ; and mitigating the repercussions of the rollback in constitutional protections to reproductive choice that could u nduly affect low -income women and co mmunities of color, thus, exacerbating existing racial/ethnic and social inequities in maternal and infant health. Reducing Inequity and Focusing on the Social Determinants of Health. For several interviewees and focus group members, a vision of the future included steps to reduce inequ ity and address the social determinants of health. o Expanding E mployment Opportunities: Recommendations to improve economic and employment opportunities included: 1) incorporating more vocational training programs in high schools to facilitate transition into the workforce ; 2) incentivizing employers to hire veterans and \"My biggest wish for this community is that we don't have such an economically diverse community. If there's a way to really help the fam ilies with the lowest economic resources to really have more financial stability, that would be ideal .\" - Key informant interviewee 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment ix transgender and other LGBTQ+ people ; 3) providing expanded workforce protections (e.g., sick leave, improved wages, childcare) for all workers, including those who are foreign -born; and 4) supporting small business owners. o Addressing the Housing Deficit : Recommendations related to expanding access to housing and addressing homelessness included: 1) earmarking more affordable housing units in the new developments, including housing for veterans; 2) implementing the existing rent control policies, which also apply to foreign -born residents regardless of immigration status; 3) renovating abandoned build ings for low -income families ; 4) increasing the availability of safe temporary shelters for unhoused individuals, including for domestic and community violence survivors; and 5) fomenting first -time buyers' subsidies as a promising initiative to address in tergenerational poverty . Partnerships, Community Engagement, and Community Building . Participants valued the robust partnerships established among multiple organizations and across sectors and suggested deepen ing engagement with trusted community -based organizations, such as those representing Asian, Latino, and LGBTQ+ residents, as partners in outreach and information sharing about community services and programs. Participants underscored more community outreach, a strong plan to reengage the community, and investing in the community as strategic areas moving forward. Key Themes Several overarching themes emerged from the Jersey City Medical Center /Hudson County 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment. Importantly , several key areas, including increasing access to care, the importance of preventive care , and safety and violence prevention echoed those priorities identified by the community in 2019 as part of the prior CHNA process, and provide an opportunity to continue building upon those efforts. The Hudson County communities that JCMC serves are diverse and health disparities exist. There is great variation in terms of demographic composition, income levels, and health status in Hudson County , with over 40% of residents not English proficient . Secondary data show disparities in healthcare access and health outcomes based on race/ethnicity. A larger proportio n of Asian and Latino community survey respondents reported feeling discriminated against when receiving care. Secondary data show that Black residents experience higher rates of premature, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality, and diabetes compared to residents of other racial/ethnic groups. Residents viewed chronic conditions as prevalent and linked to the social determinants of health . Diabetes and high blood pressure were discussed as prevalent in the community, especially among low-income residents an d communities of color, and survey respondents indicated \"overweight/obesity\" was the second most common health issue in their community. However, focus group participants focused on the barriers to healthy living faced by residents, including affording healthy foods, cost of medication, and having time to exercise and to spend outdoors . \"Prices have been slowly rising, amazing that they have money to build these new buildings but can't help people maintain the property they have here ....\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment x Housing, food insecurity , and employment opportunities are top community concerns. Participants identified lack of quality affordable housing as a ke y gap in the area . Food insecurity was another area of concern , with almost half of Latino survey respondents worrying about running out of money to purchase food. Housing and food are related to income . Over 10% of Hudson residents reported being unemployed during the pandemic, with large variation by neighborhood. Overall, participants recommended the adoption of more policies to promote equity and support the well - being of low-income residents . Mental health was identified as a significant community health concern. Mental health was identified as a top community health concern, closely associated with racial/ethnic disparities, economic instability, and chronic conditions. Black residents faced a dispro portionate mental health burden. The rate of mental health hospitalizations in 2020 was 70% higher among adult Black residents (107.1 per 100,000) than the Hudson County average (63.1 per 100,000). Black children had 38% higher hospitaliz ation rates for mental health conditions than the county rate (34.7 per 100,000 vs. 25.2 per 100,000). Veterans and LGBTQ+ advocates also highlighted the mental health needs of their communities. Residents mentioned stigma and insufficient culturally competent providers as the principal barriers to mental health care access and emphasized the need to engage in more education efforts . Violence as an important health concern . Violence and safety were raised as community concer ns. Some participants indicated that their neighborhoods were safe; however only 40% of survey respondents agreed that violence was not prevalent in their communities.28 Further, violence and safety w ere mentioned as the top health concern by Black survey respondents. Participants suggested continuing to strengthen efforts to end the cycle of violence by addressing its social determinants of health, through support of programs such as the Anti-Violence Coalition and Project H.U.D.S.O.N. Hudson County has a wealth of social service organizations and health care services, including those providing preventive care, though many residents experience barriers to accessing these resources. Residents remarked that Hudson County had a wealth of healt h care and social service assets. Residents noted that having a primary care doctor and being linked to a FQHC and/or a community -based organization were facilitating factors to accessing care. They also discussed the importance of culturally competent providers, including providers who spoke their language and looked like them. Veterans and those working with violence survivors highlighted that having pee rs and mentors who could provide trauma informed care helped to be engaged in care. Participants in the healthcare field unanimously noted a decline in access to preventive care and mentioned this as a priority strategic area. Recommendations in this area included continuing to uplift partnerships and community engagement to bridge the care gap. Another recommendation included better communication about existing programs and services to reach multiple constituencies. Conclusion s Through this comprehensive and iterative assessment process, ten major areas were identified as community needs after gathering input through qualitative data from residents and stakeholders, feedback from a community priorities survey, and quantitative surveillance an d secondary data. These included in no particular order : 28 Community Health Needs Assessment Survey Data, Bruno & Ridgway, 2021 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment xi Financial Insecurity Unemployment Food Insecurity Housing Chronic Diseases (e.g., heart disease, cancer, diabetes) Infectious Diseases, including COVID -19 Violence Prevention & Safety Mental Healt h Substance Use Access to Preventive Care After a prioritization process with the Advisory Committee and discussions within the hospital taking into consideration existing expertise, capacity, and experience, JCMC will focus on Access to Preventive Care; Chronic Disease Management, including Behavioral Health Services; Food Insecurity and Education; and Violence Prevention and Safety as priorities during the development of its implementation plan i n 2023. JCMC will tackle these priority action areas as part of ongoing community engagement efforts and with an overarching emphasis on addressing systemic racism, racial injustice, and discrimination .2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 1 Introduction Community Health Needs Assessment Purpose and Goals A community health needs assessment (CHNA) is a systematic process to identify and analyze community health needs and assets, prioritize those needs, and then implement strategies to improve community health. In 202 2, the RWJBa rnabas Health Jersey City Medical Center (JCMC ) undertook the current CHNA process using a mixed -methods and participatory approach . JCMC is located in Jersey City, Hudson County, New Jersey , and is part of the RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH) system. RWJBH is a non -profit healthcare organization which includes 1 2 acute care hospitals, three acute care children's hospitals, a leading pediatric rehabilitation hospital, a freestanding acute behavioral health hospital, a clinically integrated network of ambulatory care centers, two trauma centers, a satellite emergency department, geriatric centers, the state's largest behavioral health network, ambulatory surgery centers, comprehensive home care and hospice programs, long term care facilities, f itness and wellness centers, retail pharmacy services, medical groups, diagnostic imaging centers, a clinically integrated network and collaborative accountable care organization . As one of the licensed general acute care hospitals and one of two trauma centers within the system, JCMC admits nearly 16,000 inpatients and provides over 201,000 outpatient visits annually. In 202 1, the 34 8-bed hospital attended over 81,100 emergency department visits and delivered nearly 2,000 babies. JCMC is a DNV (which stands for det norske veritas) fully accredited hospital and has been recognized for its excellence in providing care and support for the health and wellness of the Hudson County community. In early 2021, RWJBH hired Health Resources in Action (HRiA) , a non -profit public health consultancy organization, to provide support, help facilitate, and conduct data analysis for the CHNAs across the system. HRiA worked closely with RWJBH, JCMC , the JCMC Community Outreach & Social Impact Steering Committee , and a Jersey City/Hudson County CHNA Advisory Board The RWJBH JCMC /Hudson County CHNA aims to gain a greater understanding of the issues that community residents face, how those issues are currently being addressed, and where there are gaps and opportunities to address these issues in the future. This report presents findings from the 202 2 JCMC needs assessment processes, which was conducted between March -September 2022. The specific goals of this CHNA are to: Systematically i dentify the needs, strengths, and resources of the community to inform future planning, Understand the current health status of the service area overall and its sub -populations within their social context, Engage the community to help determine community needs and social determinant of health needs, and Fulfill the IRS mandate for non -profit hospitals. Area of Focus This CHNA process aims to fulfill multiple purposes for a range of stakeholders. To be as inclusive as possible, t he focus area of the RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center /Hudson County CHNA encompasses JCMC's primary and secondary service areas in Hudson County . JCMC's primary service area include the 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 2 following Jersey City zip codes : includes Bayonne, Union City and Hoboken, which encompass the following zip codes : 07002, 07087, and 07030, respectively. Both the primary and secondary service areas are the focus of this CHNA , represented in Figure 1 below. Context for the Community Health Needs Assessment This CHNA was conducted during an unprecedented time, given the COVID -19 pandemic and the national movement for racial justice. This context had a significant impact on the assessment approach and content. COVID -19 Pandemic The country was still recovering from the novel coronavirus (COVID -19) pandemic when the activities of this assessment were conducted. This impacted both the CHNA data collection process and topics, as well as concerns that participants put forth during discu ssions in focus groups and interviews. In March 2022, at the beginning of this CHNA process, the COVID -19 pandemic had already been in effect for over two year s. Logistically, the pandemic impacted the feasibility of convening in -person groups for the CHNA (e.g., subcommittees, focus groups, etc.) and the availability of key stakeholders and community members to participate in CHNA activities, given their focus on addressing immediate needs. Consequently, all data collection and engagement occurred in a vir tual setting (e.g., telephone or video focus groups, interviews), and engagement of residents and stakeholders was challenging. (A more detailed description of this engagement process may be found in the Methods section, and COVID -19 data specific to this service area is provided in the Infectious and Communicable Disease section of this report.) Substantively, during the CHNA process, COVID -19 was and remains a health concern for communities and has also exacerbated underlying inequities and social needs. The pandemic brought to light both the Figure 1. Focused JCMC CHNA Area Map 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 3 capabilities and gaps in the healthcare system, the public health infrastructure, and social service networks. In this context, an assessment of the community's strengths and needs, and in particular the social deter minants of health, is both critically important and logistically challenging. This CHNA should be considered a snapshot in time, which is consistent with public health best practices. Moving forward , the community should continue to be engaged to understan d how identified issues may evolve and what new issues or concerns may emerge over time. National Movement for Racial Justice Over the past few year s, sparked by the national protests for racial equity amidst the killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, B reonna Taylor, Tony McDade, and many others, national attention was focused on how racism is embedded in every system and structure of our country, including housing, education, employment, and healthcare. This context impacted the content of the CHNA, inc luding the design of data collection instruments and the input that was shared during interviews and focus groups. While racism and oppression have persisted in this country for over 400 years, it is important to acknowledge the recent focus on these issue s in 202 2 in the form of increased dialogue, locally and nationally, as context for this assessment. Awareness of racism and discrimination among Hudson City residents was renewed in 2022 with ongoing incidents of anti -Asian hate crimes and the naming of Jersey City by the Buffalo mass shooter. Methods The following section details how data for the CHNA were compiled and analyzed, as well as the broader lens used to guide this process. Social Determinants of Health Framework While this CHNA aimed to be comprehensive, its data collection approach focused on the social and economic upstream issues that affect a community's health (Figure 2). Upstream Approaches to Health Having a healthy population is about more than delivering quality healthcare to residents. Where a person lives, learns, works, and plays all have an enormous impact on health. Health is not only affected by people's genes and lifestyle behaviors, but by upstream factors such as employment status, quality of housing, and economic policies. Figure 2 provides a visual representation of these relationships, demonstrating how individual lifestyle factors, which are closest to health outcomes, are influenced by more upstream factors, such as employment status and educational opportunities. 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 4 Figure 2. Social Determinants of Health Framework DATA SOURCE: World Health Organization, Commission on the Social Determinants of Health, Towards a Conceptual Framework for Analysis and Action on the Social Determinants of Health, 2005. The data to which we have access is often a snapshot in time, but the people represented by that data have lived their lives in ways that are constrained and enabled by economic circumstances, social context, and government policies. To this end, much of thi s report is dedicated to discussing the social, economic, and community context in which residents live. We hope to understand the current health status of residents and the multitude of factors that influence health to enable the identification of priorit ies for community health planning, existing strengths and assets upon which to build, and areas for further collaboration and coordination. Health Equity Lens The influences of race, ethnicity, income, and geography on health patterns are often intertwined. In the United States, social, economic, and political processes ascribe social status based on race and ethnicity, which may influence opportunities for educational and occupational advancement and housing options, two factors that profoundly affect health. Institutional racism, economic inequality, discriminatory policies, and historical oppression of specific groups are a few of the factors that drive health inequities in the U.S. In the present report, health patterns for the Hudson County area are described overall, as well as areas of need for particular population groups. Understanding factors that contribute to health patterns for these populations can facilitate the identification of data -informed and evidence -based strategies to provid e all residents with the opportunity to live a healthy life. Approach and Community Engagement Process The CHNA aimed to engage agencies, organizations, and community residents through different avenues. The CHNA process was guided by strategic leadersh ip from the RWJBH Systemwide CHNA Steering Committee, the JCMC Community Outreach & Social Impact Steering Committee , and the community overall. RWJBH System Engagement This CHNA is part of a set of CHNAs being conducted across the entire RWJBH system. Ea ch of these CHNAs use s a consistent framework and a minimum set of indicators but the approach and engagement 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 5 process are tailored for each community. A Systemwide CHNA Steering Committee was convened twice prior to the launch of JCMC CHNA process (early a nd late June 2021). This Steering Committee provided input and feedback on major data elements (e.g., secondary data key indicators, overall Table of Contents) and core prioritization criteria for the planning process. A list of Systemwide CHNA Steering Committee members can be found in Acknowledgments section. CHNA Advisory Committee Engagement A CHNA Advisory Committee was constituted to guide th e process . The Advisor y Committee included over 80 stakeholders representing a range of relevant fields and organizations throughout Hudson County. The CHNA Advisory Committee was engaged at critical intervals throughout this process. In March 2022, the Advisory Committee met for a kick -off meeting during which HRiA p rovided an overview of the CHNA process and Bruno & Ridgeway, Inc. presented the findings from a community survey the firm conducted in 2021. These two presentations were followed by a brief Q&A and discussion with Advisory Committee members. After the mee ting, Advisory Committee members were invited to participate in a survey to help identify what populations and sectors to engage in focus groups and key informant interviews. The results of this survey directly informed development of an engagement plan to guide qualitative data collection. During the data collection process, Advisory Committee members also assisted with organizing focus groups with community residents, participating in key informant interviews, and/or connecting HRiA to stakeholders in the community. The Advisory Committee reconvened in October 2022. During this meeting, HRiA staff presented the findings from the CHNA process, including preliminary priorities that emerged upon review of the qualitative and secondary data. Advisory Committe e members had the opportunity to ask questions, then discussed and voted on the top priorities for the hospital to consider when developing its implementation plan. A detailed description of the prioritization process can be found in the Prioritization Pro cess and Priorities Selected for Planning section. In addition, t he JCMC Community Outreach & Social Impact Steering Committee was engaged throughout the process as a means of obtaining feedback from internal JCMC stakeholders who have firsthand knowledge of the community. Members of the JCMC Steering Committee participated in the Advisory Committee activities a nd in a focus group in June 2022 . The JCMC Steering Committee reviewed the report in full and adopted it in a meeting in November 2022 . See Appendix A for a list of CHNA Advisory Committee members , which include the JCMC Steering Committee members . Commun ity Engagement Community engagement is described further below under the primary data collection methods. Capturing and lifting up a range of voices, especially those not typically represented in these processes, was a core component to this initiative. It should be noted that, due to the COVID -19 pandemic, the community engagement for this CHNA occurred virtually. Additionally, while the CHNA aimed to engage a cross -section of individuals and to be inclusive of traditionally under -represented communities, outreach was challenging given the pandemic and competing priorities. Nevertheless, by engaging the community through multiple methods and in multiple languages, this CHNA aims to describe community strengths and needs during this unique time. Secondary Data: Review of Existing Secondary Data, Reports, and Analyses Secondary data are data that have already been collected for another purpose. Examining secondary data helps us to understand trends, provide a baseline, and identify differences by sub -groups . It also helps in guiding where primary data collection can dive deeper or fill in gaps. 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 6 Secondary data for this CHNA were drawn from a variety of sources, including the U.S. Census American Community Survey (ACS), the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Federal Bureau of Investigation Uniform Crime Reports, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, County Health Rankings, the New Jersey Department of Education, New Jersey Department of Health's New Jersey State Health Assessment Data (NJSHAD ), and a number of other agencies and organizations. This CHNA also utilizes reports from a variety of organizations at the community, state, and national level , including , but not limited to , the United Way of New Jersey's ALICE Study, The Partnership for a HealthierJC, and others. Additionally, hospitalization data from the RWJBH system is also included in Appendix H. Secondary data were analyzed by the agencies that collected or received the data. Data are typically presented as frequencies (%) or rates per 100,000 population. It should be noted that when the narrative makes comparisons between towns, by subpopulation, or with NJ overall, these are lay comparisons and not statistically significant differences. It should also be noted that for most social and economic indicators, the U.S. Census American Community Survey (ACS) 5 -year (201 6-2020) aggregate datasets were used over the one -year datasets, to improve statistical reliability for areas with small er population sizes and small population subgroups. Since the ACS uses a probability sampling technique, using the five -year aggregate dataset over the one - year data provides a larger sample size and more precision in its estimates. Primary Data Collection Primary data collection entailed a mixed methods approach consisting of interviews , focus groups, and a community survey, as detailed below. Qualitative Discussion: Key Informant Interviews and Focus Groups Key Informant In terviews A total of seven key informant interview discussions were completed with 1 2 individuals by Zoom or telephone. Interviews were 35-60-minute semi -structured discussions that engaged institutional, organizational, and community leaders as well as front -line staff across sect ors. Discussions explored interviewees' experiences of addressing community needs and priorities for future alignment, coordination, and expansion of services, initiatives, and policies. Sectors represented in these interviews included: local public health department s, public education , housing services, the faith community, and those who serve/work with specific populations (e.g., immigrant community, LGBTQ residents, young people ). See Appendix B f or a list of organizations engaged through key informant interviews and Appendix C for the key informant interview guide. Focus Groups A total of 105 community residents participated in 6 virtual focus groups (telephone or video) conducted with specific populations of interest: veterans, Black residents, Spanish -speaking Latino residents, and Asian residents . Focus groups were up to 60 -minute semi -structured conversations and aimed to delve deeply into the community's needs, strengths, and opportunities for the future and to gather feedback on priorities f or action. Please see Appendix D for the focus group facilitator's guide. In addition, a guided discussion was carried out with the JCMC Community Outreach & Social Impact Steering Committee , who se members are in direct contact with Hudson City residents in their role as health care providers, hospital administrators, leaders, and community residents themselves. The discussion lasted 60 minutes and was conducted via Zoom. The discussion aimed to determine 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 7 perceptions of the strengths and needs of the Hudso n County community served by JCMC, and identify the sub-populations most affected , to explore how these issues can be addressed in the future , and t o identify opportunities for JCMC to address the community needs more effectively moving forward. Analyses The collected qualitative information was coded and then analyzed thematically by data analysts for main categories and sub -themes. Analysts identified key themes that emerged across all groups an d interviews as well as the unique issues that were noted for specific populations. Throughout the qualitative findings included in this report, the term \"participants\" is used to refer to key informant interview and focus group participants. Unique issues that emerged among a group of participants are specified as such. Frequency and intensity of discussions on a specific topic were key indicators used for extracting main themes. While differences between towns are noted where appropriate, analyses emphasi zed findings common across the service area. Selected paraphrased quotes \u2014without personal identifying information \u2014are presented in the narrative of this report to further illustrate points within topic areas. Community Survey A community priorities survey was developed and administered over a six-month period from April to August 2021 by the survey firm Bruno & Ridgway, who was contracted directly by the RWJBH system. The survey focused on health issues and concerns that impact the community; community saf ety and quality of life; personal health attitudes, conditions , and behaviors; barriers to accessing health care; discrimination when receiving medical care; and the impact of COVID -19 and vaccination compliance. The survey was administered online and was available in paper in 5 languages (English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, and Chinese). Outreach for survey dissemination was conducted with assistance from the RWJBH system, the hospital, and its community partners, as well as through social media and the web . Additionally, an online panel sample was recruited to capture additional survey responses from specific areas to augment the larger sample. Postcards with QR codes that linked to the survey were distributed at vaccination events for community members to take while they waited for their COVID -19 vaccine. The final sample of the community priorities survey comprised 273 respondents who were residents of Hudson County. Appendix F provides a table with demographic composition of survey respondents. Respondents to the Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment Survey were predominately White, female, and high er socioeconomic status. About 74% were employed full -time. Throughout this report, Hudson County residen ts who participated in the Community Health Needs Assessment Survey are referred to as \"respondents\" (whereas focus group members and interviewees are referred to as \"participants\" for distinction) . Analyses Frequencies were calculated for each survey question. Not all respondents answered every question; therefore, denominators in analyses reflect the number of total responses for each question, which varied by question. Statistical testing (Z -tests) was cond ucted across sub -groups to determine whether there were significance differences between groups. Survey data by race/ethnicity specifically is presented in this report. Racial/ethnic groups are delineated by a letter (A, B, C, D). When a graph has a letter next to the bar, it indicates that the group for that bar has a statistically significant different frequency of responses compared to the group of the letter shown (e.g., when an A is on the bar of White respondents, it indicates that percentage of White respondents answering the question in that 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 8 particular way is statistically significantly different than Asian respondents). Significant differences at 90% confidence levels are presented in the report. Data Limitations As with all data collection efforts, there are several limitations that should be acknowledged. Numerous secondary data sources were drawn upon in creating this report and each source has its own set of limitations. Overall, it should be noted that differe nt data sources use different ways of measuring similar variables (e.g., different questions to identify race/ethnicity). There may be a time lag for many data sources from the time of data collection to data availability. Some data are not available by sp ecific population groups (e.g., race/ethnicity) or at a more granular geographic level (e.g., town or municipality) due to small sub -sample sizes. In some cases, data from multiple years may have been aggregated to allow for data estimates at a more granul ar level or among specific groups. With many organizations and residents focused on the pandemic and its effects, community engagement and timely response to data collection requests were challenging. Additionally, with its online administration method, the community survey used a convenience sample. Since a convenience sample is a type of non -probability sampling, there is potential selection bias in who participated or was asked to participate in the survey. Due to this potential bias, results cannot ne cessarily be generalized to the larger population. Similarly, while interviews and focus groups provide valuable insights and important in -depth context, due to their non -random sampling methods and small sample sizes, results are not necessarily generaliz able. Due to COVID -19, focus groups and interviews were also conducted virtually, and therefore, while both video conference and telephone options were offered, some residents who lack reliable access to the Internet and/or cell phones may have experienced difficulty participating. This report should be considered a snapshot of an unprecedented time, and the findings in this report can be built upon through future data collection efforts. 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 9 Population Characteristics Population Overview According to the 201 6-2020 American Community Survey (U.S. Census), Hudson County is the fourth most populous county in New Jersey (671,923 residents) . The Jersey City Medical Center's primary and secondary service area comprises 6 Jersey City zip codes (totaling 330,002 residents) , and the cities of Bayonne (65,112 residents) , (68,073) . There has been great variability in population growth across the areas examined. Whereas New Jersey ov erall and Hudson County , specifically, have seen minimal changes in total population between the periods 2011 -2015 and 2016 -2020 , Jersey City zip code 07302 experienced a population growth explosion (18.5 %), whereas zip codes 07306 and 07307 experienced an important population exodus during the same period ( -7.1% and -9.9%, respectively) . The population of Bayonne and Union City declined (-0.4% and -0.8%, respectively ) and that of Hoboken increased (1.6%) minimally over this time (Table 1). Table 1.

Age distribution data by town and gender can be found in the Appendix of additional data. 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 10 Figure 3. Age Distribution, by State and County, 2016 -2020 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2011 -2015 and 2016 -2020 When examining age distribution data by race/ethnicity in Hudson County, children under 18 made up a greater percentage of the population among persons of Other Race (26.9%) and Hispanic/Latino s (15.7%) , followed by Black (14.6%) , and a smaller proportion of Asian (11.2%) and White (10.3%) residents. Adults aged 65 and over comprise d 9.9% of the White population compared to 6 .1% of the Asian population , see Table 2. Table 2.

Racial, Ethnic, and Language Diversity Racial and Ethnic Composition Focus group members and interviewees described their communities as racially and ethnically diverse and valued this diversity as one of Hudson County's greatest assets. The secondary data support these perceptions. Hudson County is predominantly made up of Hispanic/Latino residents, which make up 40.4% of its population , followed by White non - Hispanic (28.5%) , Asian (17.0%), and Black (9.8%). Huds on County has proportionally more Hispanic/Latino and Asian residents than New Jersey as a whole ( Figure 4). See the Appendix for detailed data tables. Figure 4. Racial and Ethnic Distribution, by State and County, 2020 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, Decennial Census of Population and Housing, 2020 Data labels not shown for p ercentages <4% . In 2016 -2020, the racial and ethnic distributions varied widely across Hudson County (Table 3) with Hoboken and Union City being the most homogenous cit ies, and zip codes within Jersey City being quite diverse . For example, in Jersey City zip code 07310, 57.3% of the population identified as Asian, compared to 3.5% in Union City . The largest Black population was found in zip codes 07305 and 07304, which made up 4 4.1% and 3 4.8% of residents, compared to 2. 3% in Union Hispanic/Latino White, non-Hispanic Other, non-Hispanic \"Jersey City's greatest strength has always been diversity .\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 12 Residents identifying as Hispanic/Latino made up 76.7% of the Union City and 42.2 % of the Jersey City zip code 07307 population , in contrast to 9. 3% in zip code 07310. Residents identifying as non -Hispanic White were concentrated in Hoboken ( 67.1% of residents) , followed by Bayonne ( 44.3 %), and made the smallest proportion of the population in zip code 07305 (11. 7%). Table 3. Racial and Ethnic Distribution, by Town, 2016 -2020 Asian, Non - Hispanic Black, Non - Hispanic Hispanic/ Latino White, Non - Hispanic Other Race/ Ethnicity, SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 Foreign -Born Population Key informant and focus group participants described a robust immigrant community in Hudson County. Multiple waves of migration resulted in pockets of recent and not -so-recent immigrants from many Latin American and Caribbean as well as South east Asian countries . Secondary data show varying levels of the foreign -born population across Hudson County. More than two out of every five Hudson County residents are foreign born (43.6%), double the percentage of foreign -born residents in New Jersey as a whole (22.7%) . In 201 6-2020, the foreign - born population ranged from 1 9.4% in Hoboken to 62.8% in Jersey City zip code 07310 (Figure 5). In Hudson County, the most common countries of origin for immigrant residents were India and the Dominican Republic (making up 12.8% and 12.1% of the immigrant population, respectively) . The majority of other immigrants were from Latin America and the Caribbean , primarily Ecuador, Cuba, and Colombia (see Table 4). \"The [Filipino] community has strong roots, and generations of families that have made Jersey City their home .\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 13 Figure 5.

The anti -immigrant rhetoric of recent years, coupled with inc reases in raids targeting immigrants, has severely affected the mental well -being of this community , provoking undue stress and anxiety . This is coupled by barriers to access basic protections related to employment and housing due to their legal status. Further, these populations have been among the most affected by COVID -19, both in terms of sickness, as well as in terms of job loss. Whereas free or low-cost medical care is available to everyone regardless of documentation status via the FQHCs and other providers , participants commented that more efforts are needed to reach the entire eligible population and bridge the care gap. Language Diversity A majority of Hudson County residents over age five (59.1%) reported speaking a language other than English at home in 201 6-2020, with large local differences. For example, almost five in six Union County residents (81.8% ) and four in six in Jersey City zip codes 07306 (63.9%), 07307 (64.2%), and 07310 (65.2%) spoke a language other than English at home , compared to one in four Hoboken residents (26.4%) (Figure 6). A variety of languages are spoken across Hudson County, as indicated in the secondary data and supported by qualitative discussions. The most spoken languages other than English are Spanish (37.1%) , other Indo -European (2.6%), Chinese (2.4%), and Tagalog (2.1%) (Table 5). Other languages spoken include Russian, Polish and other Slavic languages ; French , Haitian or Cajun ; Korean ; and Vietnamese, reflecting the county's diverse communities. The distribution of these languages is not even. For example, t hree -quarters of residents in Union City speak Spanish (75.8%) , while 24.9% of residents in Jersey City zip code 07310 speak other Indo -European languages and 19.7% speak Chinese . There are also , for example, pockets of Arabic speakers in Bayonne and Jersey City zip codes 07306 and 07304 ; while the Filipino community is largely concentrated in Jersey City zip codes 07304, 07305 , and 07306 . \"This a time when immigrants are feeling unsafe.

Based on resident feedback, Hudson County is a welcoming place for foreign -born persons, non -English speakers, and people of diverse ethnic backgrounds . A Filipino resident expressed it as, \"the [Filipino] community has strong roots, and generations of families that have made Jersey City their home.\" Overwhelmingly, r esidents indicated that they enjoyed the opportunity to learn about different cultures, and to access foods and other cultural elements from a va riety of regions. As a focus group participant explained, \"It's a multicultural city so you have several different ethnicities... you get to learn about the food and people's culture.\" Residents overall also valued that medical and social services providers looked like them and spoke to them in their native language. However, opinions differed in terms of the availability of multilingual providers and providers of color. Whereas resident s of Indian descent indicated that \"there are plenty of Indian, multiple language speakers, physicians in the JCMC and in the community ,\" Latino residents were more nuanced noting that whereas the federally qualified health centers ( FQHCs ) had ample Spanish speakers, hospitals in the area needed more staff that spoke t heir language. While diversity was a substantial community strength, participants noted that it could also be a challeng e to engagement . In Hudson County, 40.5% of residents were not proficient in English in 2016 - 2020 , ranging from 18.4% in Jersey City zip code 07310 to 48.3% i n Union City . Lack of English proficiency can pose a barrier to entering the professional workforce, learning, and accessing healthcare. Those working in the social sector worr ied about populations not reached with information or services. In the words of a public health official, \"we talk to funders all the time about how to translate health information into other languages, how to connect to communities. We talk about it all the time, how to get into mosques, communicate in o ther ways besides English newspapers, how to create equity for people who are following the news.\" In addition, lack of English -proficiency can lead to discrimination. According to survey data, 22.7% of Asian respondents and 17.6% of Latino community respo ndents specifically described being discriminated against because of language/speech issues when receiving medical care (discussed in greater detail in the Discrimination and Racism section of this report.) \"I do feel welcome by healthcare providers, but I have experienced going with my parents who are immigrants with heavy accents, and I have experienced miscommunication. \" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 17 Figure 7.

About 2% of the Hudson County population are veterans, with the city of Bayonne having the highest percentage of the areas observed (3.9%) ( Figure 8). The race/ethnicity of veterans in Hudson County mimics the diversity of the county's population . Hudson County has proportionately more veterans who identify as Asian (6.1%), Black (15.6%), and Latino (29.1%) residents than the state (Figure 9), with important variation across neighborh oods. A majority of veterans in Jersey City zip codes 07304 and 07305 identify as Black (42.6% and 63.4%, respectively) , whereas 40.8% of veterans in Jersey City zip code 07310 identify as Asian, and 68.6% of veterans in Union City identify as Latino. Bayonne and Jersey City 0 7302 have the highest concentration of White veterans Jersey City (07304) Jersey City (07305) Jersey City (07306) Jersey City (07307) Jersey City (07310) Union City2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 18 Figure 8.

The categories of race and ethnicity are not mutually exclusive unless stated. Values under 5.0% are omitted for clarity. Veterans in Hudson County remarked that they had limited e mployment opportunities available to them. They mentioned that, often, the jobs available to them after serving the government were for positions requiring no special skills, underpaid , and with few possibilities for advancement Jersey City (07304) Jersey City (07305) Jersey City (07306) Jersey City Jersey City (07304) Jersey City (07305) Jersey City (07306) Jersey City (07307) Jersey City (07310) Union CityAmerican Indian/Alaska Native Asian Black or African American Hispanic or Latino White, not Hispanic or Latino2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 19 an important factor in gaining access to higher -paying positions. When examining the educational attainment of veterans in Hudson County, we observe that most veterans did not have a bachelor's degree or higher (71.4%) ( Figure 10). Only 10.8% of residents obtained a college degree in Jersey City zip code 07304, where many Black veterans reside . Employment and education , together with mental and physical health, are closely related to poverty. A higher proportion of veterans in Hudson County live below the poverty line than in New Jersey (7.5% vs. 5.2%, respectively). This proportion is much higher in Jersey City 07306, where one in five veterans liv e in poverty, and Jersey City zip code 07305, where 18.0% do. It is important to remember that the poverty line is substantially below a livable income and has become even more so recently with high rates of inflation . Special issues faced by veterans are discussed throughout the report in the specific topic area sections. Figure 10.

For example, j obs that pay a living wage enable workers to live in neighborhoods that promote health (e.g., built environments that promote physical activity and resident engagement, better access to affordable healthy foods), and provide income and benefits to access health care. In contrast, unemployment, underemployment, and job instability make it difficult to afford housing, goods and services that are linked with health and health car e, and also contribute to stressful life circumstances that affect multiple aspects of health . Community Strengths and Assets Understanding the resources and services available in a community \u2014as well as their distribution \u2014helps to elucidate the assets that can be drawn upon to address community health, as well as any gaps that might exist. Strong Community and Partnerships In addition to diversity noted previously , another strength mentioned by participants was solidarity and a strong sense of community . Time and time again, participants noted that neighbors came together to help those in need . As a resident noted, \"My specific neighborhood is very close knit, you know the people in the area and people are willing to help you. For example, when it snows , I've had young kids, young teenagers ask like, can Jersey City (07304) Jersey City (07305) Jersey City (07306) Jersey City (07307) Jersey City (07310) Union City2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 21 Residents remarked that the community was able to organize and take action to address people's needs and this came to the forefront throughout the pandemic , including through generous donations . A healthcare administrator echoed this sentiment , \"these are communities that show up when the need is there, and we saw that during the COVID pandemic. We raised over a million dolla rs for an emergency response fund, from old donors and new donors.\" At an institutional level, another strength are the robust partnerships established among multiple organizations and across sectors , including grassroots organizations , government, small businesses, social services agencies, and health care centers . These collaborations are exemplified by the Partnership for a HealthierJC, made up of nearly 300 member organizations. A public health official noted, \"We have great partners. Hudson County is very tight, so we all work together. \" As a health administrator said when reflecting on the response to COVID -19, \"As organizations ... who did demonstrate that more than whatever resources were available to our community , we all jumped in and that includes J ersey City Medical Center . We were able to get people in and out of the hospitals quickly and people were able to communicate with each other .\" This was echoed by public health staff from different areas of Hudson County, as exemplified by what this participant from Bayonne said, \"Whenever there is an emergency , Bayonne comes together as a community to help people out, through donations or referra ls for services.\" Public Services and Programs Some participants indicated that their elected officials were a source of strength in Hudson County. A diverse array of residents, including from the Latino, Asian, and LGBTQ+ community, indicated being represented and supported by government leaders. One example of support for the LGBTQ+ community was the recent passing of the law to let students use bathrooms that are consistent with their gender identity , considered an important step in fostering welcoming and safe spaces for gender nonbinary youth. Residents noted that the Jersey City government was responsive to their needs and that they received abundant support during the COVID -19 pandemic, as expressed by a Latino resident, \"The mayor's office provides very good services ; for example, if someone has to travel far to get to the doctor, or if they need translation of a document to Spanish \u2014you can call the mayor's office for everything.\" Overall, residents indicated that Hudson County offers many services to people to ensur e that residents live well and can access their basic needs. The map below shows the distribution of hospitals, schools, and childcare centers in the area. There are four acute care hospitals as well as 151 schools and 301 childcare centers in the JCMC s ervice area (Figure 12). \"I'm new to Jersey City, but I noticed since doing Covid work in June that there is a strong sense of community. \" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 22 DATA SOURCE: New Jersey Geographic Information Network (NJGIN), Schools and Child Care Centers, 2018 and Acute Care Hospitals, 2020 As one resident summed up, \"...there is something going on almost every week to help with food, home purchases, that's one of the things I really love about Jersey City.\" A Hoboken resident expressed something similar , noting that a strength in Hoboken were the \"strong non -profit orga nizations and religious organizations that provide supportive services related to housing assistan ce and information, nutritional support, recreational activities for children, tutoring ...\" Latino residents discussed how the county offered resources in the community to support people, including people who are low -income, undocumented , and/ or without health insurance . Other Community Assets Community survey respondents partially agreed with these themes. When asked how much they agreed or disagreed with a number of statements about their community, responses were similar to when this survey was administered in 2019. The strengths identified by the greatest proportion of respondents in 2021 were that it was easy to find fresh fruits and veget ables in their communities (73.6 %), that their communities had safe outdoor places to walk and play (70.3 %), and that their community was a good place to raise a family (59.7%) and to socialize (58.2%) (Figure 13). These were the same top responses in 2019. Figure 12. Community Assets Map of Hudson Count y, 2018 & 2020 \"From my experience, over 20 years, I feel that the greatest strength s are the community -based organizations. We have a wide range of individuals who form different communities, even small grassroots community -based organizations, to engage people in healthy ways .\" - Key informant interviewee 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 23 Figure 13. Percent o f Community Survey Respondents Noting Strengths in Their Community (Agree or Completely Agree with Statements) (n=2 73), 2021 DATA SOURCE: Community Health Needs Assessment Survey Data, Bruno & Ridgway, 2021 However, responses to these questions varied by race/ethnicity . For example, as can be observed in Figure 14, White respondents were significantly more likely than Asian, Black, and Latino respondents to agree or completely agree that their community had safe outdoor places to walk and play. As desc ribed in the Methods section, when a graph of community survey data has a letter next to the bar, it indicates that the group for that bar has a statistically significant different frequency of responses compared to the group of the letter shown . As shown, whereas 81.0% of Wh ite respondents perceived outdoor spaces as safe, only 59.1% of Asian respondents did so. Whereas there were no significant differences by respondents' race/ethnicity to the statement about having spaces to socialize, Asian (63.6%) and White (66.7%) respondents more often indicated that the community was a good place to raise their family than Black (34.6%) respondents (Figure 15). (More detailed discussions of responses by different population groups of other survey questions are found in the topic -specific sections of this report.)

School Environment and Health A positive school environment is an important determinant of physical and mental wellbeing, as well as academic success, staying in school, and opting to continue on to higher education. An interview ee who was a member of the LGBTQ+ community lauded schools for their efforts to make school safe and welcoming to all youth. In their word s, \"[LGBTQ+] youth are still dealing with bullying, [but] schools are reaching out to learn and make spaces safer. School leaders come in to engage us as a liaison, to organize school clubs that are inclusive and to receive cultural competency training from us.\" Conversely, being healthy is a key factor in being academically successful. Schools play an important role in facilitating access to care and helping students stay healthy. A school administrator described some of the public school 's efforts to address the mental health needs of students, \"We've been trying through the schools with our resources to really embed more social and emotional [support to] help students overcome challenges, develop resilience, and be able to speak about thei r emotions. [We have] incorporated that through the curriculum, through our school counselors, through our school psychologist.\" Many students also face poverty and food insecurity; in providing free or low -cost lunches , schools also play an important role in ensuring basic nutrition for children. Public School ing Focus group and interview participants discussed how the public school system in Hudson County faces a variety of issues. One is a lack of sufficient resources to attend to the needs of high -need population groups. There is a perpetual shortage of qualified educators , particularly in those areas where teachers need additional certifications or schooling. An education adminis trator emphasized that more qualified Special Ed ucation teachers, bilingual teachers , and content area teachers, like those that teach Science and Math, are needed to meet the needs of the student population . Another issue that came up was the lack of affordable after school programs, particularly important for children of low-income earners. In some areas of Hudson County, such as Hobo ken, a problem identified by participants was that there is insufficient space to accommodate the growing number of school children . Residents expressed that \"[population] growth was not planned ,\" leading to overcrowding in public and charter schools . Residents discussed how new buildings and improved infrastructure for schools were needed to accommoda te the influx of new residents coming to the new condominium buildings. In spite of these challenges, most Hudson County residents indicated that public school leadership was supportive of students' needs and open to partnerships with different organizations to better serve the community. Many residents remarked that the school leadership was attuned to the needs of students and their families , many of whom face multiple struggles . Given the large immigrant community in Hudson County, schools must accommodate to the needs of English -language learners. 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 26 Key informant interviewees indicated that Hudson County public schools fall along a broad spectrum encompassing both the top-ranking , as well as the lower performing , schools in New Jersey . School p erformance is determined largely by the socioeconomic situation of the community that draws the student population. There is an inverse association between socioeconomic status and high school graduation rates. Key informant interviewees noted that s tudents experiencing poverty often had to drop out of school to start working and contribute an income to their families. These students' vision for the future oftentimes does not include college as a career path unless they have access to a mentor who can help them enter a professional career . Key i nformant interviewees explained that low -income students face d multiple obstacles to entering college , including not being able to afford it; having to full-time to support the family; and not seeing the usefulness of a college degree . Based on this contex t, key informant interviewees indicated that p ublic schools were trying to equip students' transition into the workforce by incorporating classes and training related to workplace readiness. \"We've been working on it trying to incorporate more careers, not just OK you're gonna graduate and go to college and then get a job. But, you kno w, addressing the needs of those students who will not go to college .\" Inequities in school performance are confirmed by graduation rate data from different Hudson County districts . Whereas in 2020 -2021 the Hoboken Public School District had graduation rates slightly above those of New Jersey as whole (93.6% and 92.6%, respectively), the public school districts of Bayonne, Union City, and Jersey City had lower graduation rates , with significant disparities by race/et hnicity within districts ( Table 6). For example, 95.3% of Asian students graduated from High School in Bayonne in 2020 -2021, compared to 86.4% of Black children and 78.5% of Latino children. Additional information on differences in educational attainment by race/ethnicity and by town is available in Appendix F. Table 6. 4-Year Adjusted Cohort High School Graduation Rate, by Race/Ethnicity and School District, 2020 -2021 New Jersey Statewide Asian, Non - Hispanic Black, Non- Hispanic Hispanic/ Latino 95.9% Wide 88.3% 90.5% N DATA SOURCE: New Jersey Department of Education, School Performance, Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rates, 2020 -21 NOTE: * indicates that data is not displayed to protect student privacy. An N indicates that no data is available. \"We have children who are immigrants and come in when they're 16 years old and are learni ng English . They need to graduate from high school, but they also need a job because economically they need to go work. It's a challenge.\" - Key informant interviewee 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 27 Promising Initiatives To better address the needs of community, the Jersey City Board of Education has partnered with educators, families, and the community as a whole to launch a promising model known as 'community schools. ' Community schools provide additional services than regu lar school s to meet the needs of students and families . In addition to regular school offerings, community schools aim to connect students and parents with a wide range of services , including afterschool programs, counseling, and social services. This model has helped to improv e attendance , grades, and student and parent engagement. Some of the schools have brought in health clinics that offer nutrition and health care to both students and the ir families . According to a school administrator , the key to the success of one of the community schools is that \"it's a very cohesive community,\" with \"good leadership at the school that has been good in working with the community, the providers ,\" and the fact that \"the staff, the teachers are all vested and making it successful .\" Another successful initiative that participants discussed was The Tiger's Den at Snyder High School, a result of a partnership between JCMC , The NJ Department of Childre n and Families, and the Jersey City Board of Education. The Tiger's Den offer s free, confidential social services to students, families, and staff , includ ing psychological counseling, vocational counseling , workplace readiness programs, academic support, summer employment, and after school programs . The Tiger's Den also assigns students with mentors who they can talk to about their problems and guide them to resolve issues in a positive way. Graduation rate for students participating in The Tiger's Den was 99% compared to 60% in the school overall. These are promising strateg ies to help more students from low -income families finish High School and either enter the workforce in stable employment or continue on to college , two pathways to facilitate the transition to the middle class . Inequality Growing inequality , exacerbated as much by the COVID -19 pandemic a s by policies and the existing economic model , was a theme that came out strongly in all focus groups and interviews. Most residents across racial/ethnic groups indicated that Jersey City was catering to the wealthy and that income distribution was unequal. As one participant summarized , \"We have the multimillion front, you know , waterfront properties and then we have below the poverty line, urban homes with very urban problems.\" Residents expressed frustration and a sense of injustice witnessing the rapid concentration of w ealth in fewer hands, while employment loss and inflation lead more people into poverty. Residents consistently expressed that the city was catering to affluent families in detriment to middle - and low -inco me residents , and this was evidenced by policies related to real estate credit s; infrastructure and public services investments ; and a regressive taxation structur e. Often, residents attributed racial/ethnic tension to this growing inequality , as expressed by these words , \"From our perspective you do have a lot of stressors around that, especially with gentrification, there is more tension with people originally from the neighborhood as opposite to newcomers. Tax breaks in one section, and in the African American section you can't get your garbage picked up, there is tension and anger from the 'tale of two cities' .\" As these words capture, there is also a racial/ethnic component superimposed on inequality , as Latinos and Black residents are disprop ortionately affected by household and neighborhood poverty. A Black resident reflected thus on the situation , \"they're not really including us in the expansion of Jersey City. Jersey City is up and coming, but they're not making room for low to middle income people... And this is people of all races, they're not gonna pay all that money for taxes, and there are no jobs here.\" 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 28 Neighborhood concentrated poverty compounds the effect of household povert y. Explaining the linkage between income , hopelessness, and violence, a resident noted, \"...And then there's the level of community violence. Feeling really stuck in that cycle that they're in , violence, income or job opportunities, social determinants of health like housing. People are getting push ed out as more development is coming. \" On reflecting about her vision for the future, a key informant interviewee synthesized the voices of many residents , \"My biggest wish for this community is that we don't have such an economically diverse community . If there's a way to really help the families with the lowest resource economic resources to really have a more stable financial sense, that would be the ideal. \" Inequality is reflected in many of the section s of th is report, including education, employment and workforce, income and financial security, and access to healthcare , among others . For example, i ncome inequality is greater in Hudson County (5.9) than in New Jersey overall (5.1) (Figure 16). Income inequality is calculated as the ratio of household income at the 80th percentile to that at the 20th percentile . A higher number indicates a greater income gap between the wealthiest and the poorest households. Figure 16. Income Inequality (80th to 20th Percentile Income Ratio), by State and County, 2016 -2020 DATA SOURCE:U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey as reported by County Health Rankings, University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2016 -2020 NOTE : The ratio of household income at the 80th percentile to that at the 20th percentile, where the incomes of all households in a county are listed from highest to lowest, the 80th percentile is the level of income at which only 20% of households have higher incomes, and the 20th percentile is the level of income at which only 20% of households have lower incomes. A higher inequality ratio indicates greater division between the top and bottom ends of the income spectrum. 5.15.9 New Jersey Hudson County \"It's like they don't want us to be here anymore, they're just welcoming the rich and affluent... It looks like Jersey City is trying to cater to the affluent instead of the people who grew up here.\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 29 Employment and Workforce Employment can confer income, benefits, and economic stability - factors that promote physical and mental health. Two main employment -related issues came out of the focus groups and interviews . On the one hand, many noted that employment opportunities were limited in Hudson County , particularly as a result of the pandemic . Often, they mentioned being unemployed or und eremployed. Residents also said that employment opportunities were limited even among people with college degrees without the right connections. Job instability affected many residents across multiple groups. Multiple residents complained of the dearth of well-paid employment opportunities , that offer employees health and social benefits, a fixed income , and a living wage. Many of the residents we interviewed were working poor, who, despite working , could not afford housing, or had to choose between rent, food or medicine. Indeed, in 2018, one in five of the County's households were Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed (ALICE), meaning that although employed, they did not earn enough to support their families (Figure 17), ranging from 5.1% in Jersey City zip code 07310 to 33% in Union City . Figure 17. Percent Households Falling into ALICE Population, by State and County, 2018 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2014 -2018 as reported by United Ways of New Jersey, Alice in New Jersey: A Financial Hardship Study, 2020 Participants talked about the ch allenges of the COVID -19 pandemic on essential front -line and lower wage workers, many of whom lost their jobs, either temporarily or permanently . Latino participants mentioned that many factories and restaurants closed during the pandemic and that they could not find jobs. The effects of COVID -19 on employment are also reflected in quantitative data. Black and Latino respondents were significantly more likely than White respondents to report having lost income due to COVID -19 (46.2%, 41.2% , and 27.0%, respectively) (Figure 18). Like New Jerse y as a whole, in 2019, prior to the pandemic, Hudson County reported the lowest unemployment rate (3.1%) in recent years according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (Figure 19). However, unemployment rates in 2020 spiked at 10.2% , recover ing slightly to 6.3% in 2021.

Unemployment Rate, by State and County, 2012 -2021 DATA SOURCE: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Local Area Unemployment Statistics, 2012 -2021 NOTE: Not seasonally adjusted The 2016 -2020 aggregated data from the American Community Survey show that u nemployment rates across Hudson County ranged from 2.4% in Jersey City zip code 07302 to 7.0% in Jersey City zip code 07305 and 9.2% in Jersey City zip code 07304 ( Table 7). However , this varies by race/ethnicity ( Table 8). Indeed, unemployment rates map onto racial/ethnic groups; as discussed in the section on population characteristics, residents in zip code 070302 are predominantly White (40.1%) and Asian (32.2%), whereas over two -thirds of residents in zip codes 07304 and 07305 are Black and Latino (Table 3). The highest unemployment rates in Hudson County were among Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander residents (35.9%), followed by American Indian and Alaska Native residents (10.1%) in 2016 -2020, and the lowest were among Asian (3.5%) and White (4.0%) residents ( Table 8).

Fewer than four in ten respondents agreed that \"there are job opportunities in my area.\" White respondents were more likely than respondents of any other race/ethnicity to perceive that th ere were employment opportunities in their area, although the differences were not statistically significant ( Figure 20). 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 32 Figure 20.

Racial/ethnic differences between groups noted by lettering next to the bars in the graph. It is also important to understand overlapping conditions that may affect entering the workforce. O ver the same period, unemployment rates in Hudson County were highest among women (5.6% among women compared to 4.9% among men) ( Table 22 in the Appendix ) and young people (18.8% among 16 - 19 year -olds and 11.0% among 20 to 24 year -olds) ( Table 23 in the Appendix ). The greatest difference in the female -to-male employment gap was in Jersey City zip code 07304 (10.8% female vs. 7.7% male unemployment rate), an area with many residents of color. Residents noted that certain population subgroups in Hudson County faced more obstacles than others when seeking employment opportunities . Because of stigma and discrimination, Black trans women experienced multiple challenge s to having a professional career and securing living -wage employment. As one key informant interviewee from the LGBTQ+ community explained , \"Black trans women experience the most barriers to employment. They become sex workers for survival. They have difficult experiences applying to jobs. They are ridiculed when applying to places.\" The options for gainful employment also appeared particularly dire for veterans, who are disproportionately Black and Latino. All veteran focus group participants agreed that the only types of jobs available to them either did not pay a living wage or were government jobs. Veteran focus group members expressed frustration at not being able to access satisfying and stimulating employment with growth opportunities. Residents suggested that more should be done to incentivize employers , including private employ ers, to hire trans and veteran residents. When trying to interrupt the cycle of violence, whether domestic or community violence, gainful employment is critical to help survivors get on their feet. As a staff member from a violence interruption program me ntioned, \" Employment is always an issue because you can tell folks a better day is coming, but what is the alternative? We try to never use that language unless we have an alternative. My main thing is stay safe and healthy. With the grant we just received , we have an opportunity to have 40 Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 33 participants, and we train them in electrical, plumbing, HVAC, and carpentry. Now we have something to say, I've got a job for you as long as you learn a skill and graduate from this program.\" Time and time again participants mentioned that lack of secure and well -paid employment was an important contributor to depression. As a public health official said, \"Mental health issues happen because [veterans] cannot find jobs, they don't have the mone y, they have to move in with their parents.\" And she continued , \"it's offensive to put someone who served, someone who earned a degree, behind a cash register... why are companies not stepping up, instead of making exorbitant profits, and training?\" Another resident said, \"[Not having a career], has been a part of my mental health depression.\" Income and Financial Security Income is a powerful social determinant of health that influences where people live and their ability to access resources which affects health and well -being. The effects of poverty \u2014food and housing insecurity, underinsurance , and stress leading to poor physical and mental health \u2014are compounded by environ mental factors. Areas with more concentrated poverty are also those with lower -performing schools, higher rates of community violence and substance use, buildings in worse conditions, and food deserts. Discussing issues related to children, a key informant interviewee said, \"We have, you know, that urban child with very limited resources, poverty, a lot of the issues of poverty and inter generational poverty, with grandparents raising children. \" Many households face financial insecurity across many groups . Both children and youth face substantial insecurity, as well as older adults living on retirement. As discussed in the sections on Inequality and Employment and Workforce , inflation was a major concern for low -income earners as wages have not kept up with the cost of living . People across the spectrum were affected and many residents expressed concerns about the future, mention ing that w ages were not keeping up with inflation , and as a result, more people were experiencing poverty. Income and health are interrelated. Participants mentioned that p eople with chronic illnesses and disabilities often face d financial vulnerability as they were unable to work due to their health . In the words of a resident, \"There's income barriers, which runs into all areas. When you have physical health issues, that leads to loss of income.\" On the other hand, residents noted that healthcare was not a priority when income was limited. Therefore, insufficient income becomes a barrier to accessing health insurance, preventive health care, and even treatment to manage chronic diseases. Many residents described that low -wage earners were faced with the dilemma of having to choose between fo od, rent, or medicine. Household Income and Poverty In Hudson County, financial wellbeing and insecurity varied by area. According to the 2016 -2020 American Community Survey (U.S. Census), while the median household income for Hudson County ($75,062) was below that of New Jersey ($8 5,245) as a whole , the range in household income showed stark disparities. The median annual household income in 201 6-2020 ranged from $49,457 in Union City , where a majority of residents were Latino, to $1 53,438 in Hoboken , with a majority of residents are White (Figure 21). Jersey City zip codes 07304, 07305 , 07306, and 07307 all reported having median household income s below the state average. \"People on the fringe of poverty have suffered .\" - Key informant interview ee 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 34 Figure 21. Median Household Income, by State and County, 2016 -2020 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 When analyzing these figures further, data show that Black and Latino households had lower median household incomes relative to the average across Hudson County. While Asian ($1 16,309) and White ($100,853) households reported incomes that were 55% and 34% higher than median household income in Hudson County ($ 75,062 ), respectively, Black ($ 53,196) and Hispanic/Latino ($ 52,408) households earned 29% and 3 0% below the county median , respectively (Table 9).

Around one in three households in Hoboken (36.9%), Jersey City zip code 07302 (32.4%), and Jersey City zip code 0 7310 (34.8%) had earning s of $200,000 or higher in 201 6-2020 (Figure 22.) On the other hand, more than two in five households in Jersey City zip codes 0730 4, 07305 , and 07306 earn ed a household income of $50,000 or less ; and half of the households in Union City w ere in this situation. Figure 22. Distribution of Household Income, by State, County, and Town, 2016 -2020 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 The percentage of Hudson County residents living below the poverty level represents the most extreme level of financial insecurity. For context, the federal poverty line is the same across the country - regardless of cost of living - but changes by househo ld size. In 2021, individuals living alone or considered a household of one would fall below the federal poverty level at an income level of $12,880, while federal poverty level for a family of four is $26,500. Figure 23 presents data on the percentage of residents falling below the poverty line in the state, county, and town - and zip -code -level. In Hudson County, 14.2% of individuals fall below the poverty line, but it is nearly 20% in Jersey City zip codes 07304, 07305, 07306, and Union City .

Children in Poverty, by State and County, 2019 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates, as reported by County Health Rankings, University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2019 Income and Public Assistance Several national programs administered by the st ate help low -income individuals and families in Hudson County afford basic needs and necessities. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) offers nutrition assistance to certain income -eligible Hudson County residents. From 201 6-2020, 13.9 % of households in Hudson County were receiving SNAP benefits (Figure 25). Of note, Jersey City zip code 07304 had 23.7 % and Union City had 21.6% of households receiving SNAP benefits , compared to 2.3% in Jersey City zip code 07310 . Figure 25.

However, the percentage of children eligible for the traditional free or reduced -price lunch in Hudson County was 63.5% in the 201 9-2020 school year, much higher than the state overall (38.2%) (Figure 26). Figure 26.

In Figure 27, the participant rate for persons, adults, and children receiving TANF was much higher in Hudson County than in New Jersey overall and peaked in April 2022 with a rate of 648.9 people participating in Hudson County per 100,000 population , more than double the rate of New Jersey as a whole .

However, several focus group participants and key informant interviewees mentioned being faced with the dilemma of not earning sufficient income to cover basic expenses, but not qualify ing for public assistanc e, including housing, food, or health support because they exceeded the poverty line threshold. In the words of a focus group participant , \"I know I don't 38.2%63.6% New Jersey Apr-20 Hudson County2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 39 qualify for housing ---I make too much money. I checked a few years ago because I live with my mom.\" Another participant elaborated, \"The problem in Jersey City is that the preferred housing is based upon income... The problem becomes not making enough to pay the rent, but then living with her mom, so she makes too much money because now they're doing dual income.\" Many residents expressed frustration at losing or not qualifying for benefits because their earnings were t oo high, yet not being able to buy food and other essentials. Residents suggested that the federal government should change the income eligibility limit and that more opportunities should be provided to continue supporting residents as they transition into the workforce. As discussed in the section on Community Strengths and Assets, residents noted that local government had stepped up to address their needs. Food Access and Food Security While many food access barriers are related to income constraints, access may also be more challenging for residents due to geography and transportation challenges. One of the issues highlighted by Hudson County residents was that the quality of the availa ble food varie d a lot by neighborhood. Residents noted that some Jersey City neighborhoods were food deserts , and that in others the supermarkets were not affordable. The availability of supermarkets and grocery stores varied a lot by Hudson County area, with Jersey City zip code 07306 having the largest number of supermarkets (61.7 per 100,000 persons) ( Figure 28). More data on food deserts in Appendix F- Additional Data Tables . Figure 28. Grocery Stores and Supermarkets per 100,000 by State, County, and Town, 2018 DATA SOURCE: Community Commons, Census County Business Patterns, analyzed by Center for Applied Research and Engagement Systems (CARES), 2020 35.9 26.5 38.1 31.9 51.1 42.7 61.7 27.3 16.1 48.1Hudson County Bayonne Jersey City Jersey City (07304) Jersey City (07305) Jersey City (07306) Jersey City (07307) Jersey City (07310) Union City \"It is hard to get assistance for housing where I am . You have to be making way below the poverty level. \" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 40 Food insecurity \u2014not having reliable access to enough affordable, nutritious food \u2014is directly related to financial insecurity. Residents mentioned that many families with children , older adults , and those who are housing insecure were struggling to put food, particularly healthy food , on the table. A focus group participant explained the experience of housing insecure families , \"If I'm staying with someone, I may not be able to cook my own food for my kids, as we just have a room, and maybe I have a little microwave that I could use. I don't want to impose on anybody so I get little , you know , pre-cooked meals ... so we don't get in people's way .\" According to data from Feeding America, Map the Meal Gap confirms that food insecurity is a problem for many residents; Hudson County had a higher percentage of food insecure residents than New Jersey as a whole in 2019 and 2020, and this percentage increased from one year to the next (Figure 29). However, residents also mentioned that food pantries were widely available throughout the city where low-income people could get food and that food vouchers were available to sen iors. Participants spoke about the many food distribution efforts that multiple partners, including government agencies, health care institutions, and non -governmental organizations, carried out during the pandemic to mitigate its effects and make sure that residents did not go hungry. Around one in four survey respondents overall, and about one in three Latino respondents, indicated that they relied on food pantries or other food assistance programs in Hudson County (Figure 30). Other indicators of food insecurity are presented in Figure 30. Figure 29.

Racial/ethnic differences between groups noted by lettering next to the bars in the graph. In addition to food affordability and access, nutrition literacy is important to maintain a healthy diet. Many focus group participants were aware of the association between a h ealthy diet and good health, including its importance in chronic disease management. However, some residents perceived that the main barrier to maintaining a health y diet was lack of education. As one focus group participant mentioned, \"The problem is that people see fast food as a good, cheap option, but it's not healthy - not everyone likes fruit and vegetables.\" Survey data does not seem to support this since perception: whereas a majority of survey respondents of all race/ethnicities reported knowin g what constituted a healthy diet, fewer reported being able to eat healthy foods on a regular basis (Figure 31), indicating that other factors such as affordability and access may be at play . The discrepancy is most marked among Black and Latino respondents. Further, t he availability of fast-food restaurants offering low-cost ultra -processed high caloric food s in certain neighborhoods contributes to the problem (Figure 32).

Housing Landscape As in past CHNAs, there was consensus among focus group members and interviewees that there is a significant need for affordable housing in Hudson County. Many participants noted that housing costs and high taxes were concerns. They described how affordable housing was scarce for members of their community who needed it, like low -wage earners and fixed income residents, and it is harder for others, such as seniors , veterans, and young families, to remain in the area. In the words of a resident, \"One of my friends... his parents had the house, and then he inherited it, but he ended up moving because the taxes were just too high. And that was someone who had been living in that house since birth. And he's sixty -something years old, it's just sad.\" Assessment participants discussed gentrification - the process by which rising housing costs drive out local residents who are replaced by new wealthy residents. As one interviewee described it, \"We can't not mention the housing market, it's a problem overall , but in Jersey the rate of gentrification is increasing rapidly and even those not on the fringe of poverty are experiencing that.\" While participants reported that some new housing is being built, it is not affordable for most. One focus g roup participant explained it thus , \"It's not equal. All the buildings they're putting up are all luxury buildings. When you see the word luxury, you know the rent is astronomical. I can't afford it... whereas affordable housing or housing for seniors is very limited. There are years long waiting lists. It's like they don't want us to be here anymore, they're just welcoming the rich and affluent....\" Housing co sts have been steadily rising in all areas with easy access to New York City, particularly near the waterfront , since 9-11, as New Yorkers sought to leave the city, and COVID -19 accelerated it. Housing Instability and Homelessness Inflation and uncontrolled rent increases following COVID -19 exacerbated people's concerns about housing affordability and housing stability. With some residents' financial situations being more uncertain or diminishing during the pandemic, there was greater concern that residents might lose their housing, even with the multiple housing eviction moratoriums i n place. Overall, 8.8% of respondents in Hudson C ounty reported that they or an immediate family member had lost their housing during the COVID -19 pandemic; this percentage was higher among Latinos (13.2%). Housing availability was also cited by interviewe es as an important barrier to break the cycle of violence . Relocation is one of the strategies used to prevent revictimization of community and domestic violence survivors . However, according to violence interrupters, affordable housing options in low -crim e neighborhoods are limited. Several focus group and interview participants mentioned the problem of homelessness in Hudson County communities. Multiple interviewees and focus group participants indicated that the shelters and temporary housing available were insufficient to meet the needs of the population. They considered the paradox of the proliferation of luxury rental buildings in some neighborhoods, and abandoned buildings in others , while many people are left without homes. One resident emphasized, \"Shelter, I think we need more shelters for the homeless people we have.\" On January 26, 2021, there were 882 persons experiencing homelessness on a single night in Hudson County. Of those counted, 56.1 % lived in Jersey \"It looks like Jersey City is trying to cater to the affluent instead of the people who grew up here .\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 44 City. Black residents shoulder ed the burden of homelessness. Whereas Black residents ma de up 10.3% of the population, and 18.3% of the population living under the poverty line, they made up 39.1% of the population experiencing homelessness. Participants highlighted three priority action areas to mitigate the housing problem in Hudson County : one was enact ing policies related to rent control ; the other was reducing real estate taxes; and the third was the urgent need to build or set aside more affordable housing units . A Latino participant expressed, \"The governor should control the rise of rent prices. These days it can cost $700 for a room in a shared apartment. 10 years ago, an apartment cost $500 -600, but now it can cost $1 ,200.\" Housing quality was another issue that came up in interviews. A few focus group participants commented that s ome of the affordable housing has lead, mold , and asbestos contamination , which can have devastating consequences on residents ' health, particularly among children. The problem was aggravated during COVID -19, which interrupted building quality inspections. Housing data illuminate important disparities and reflects the concerns uplifted by residents. Proportionally f ewer Hudson County residents are homeowners compared to New Jersey as a whole. In New Jersey, 6 4.0% of housing units were owner occupied in 2016 -2020, in cont rast to 32.4% in Hudson County ( Figure 33). Home ownership ranged from 12.5% in Jersey City zip code 07310 to 40.6% in Bayonne . Figure 33.

Median monthly housing costs for owner occupied households with a mortgage ranged from $2, 339 in Jersey City zip code 07304 to roughly $7,600 in Hoboken an d Jersey City zip codes 07302 and 07310 ( Table 11). Median monthly housing costs for renter occupied households ranged from $1, 247 in Union City to $2, 945 in Jersey City zip code 07310 during the same period , 2015 -2019. Table 11. Monthly Median Housing Costs, by State and County, 2015 -2019 Owner -occupied Renter -occupied $1,247 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 The average percent of income spent on housing costs is an important measure of an area's availability of affordable housing. A larger proportion of New Jersey renters, who tend t o be less wealthy than homeowners, spend over a quarter of their earnings on housing. In New Jersey, 4 6.2% of owner - occupied households with a mortgage and 6 2.2% of all renters reported spending spend more than 25% of their income on housing costs ( Table 12). Disparities in housing cost burden exist within Hudson County . In Jersey City zip codes 07302 and in Hoboken , less than one in three owner -occupied and 44% of renter -occupied households reported high housing costs whereas 64.4% of owner -occupied and 66.5% of renter -occupied residences in Union City reported spending more than 25% of their income on housing costs. Additional housing data can be found in Appendix F- Additional Data Tables . Table 12.

Only 27.8 % of survey respondents agreed or complet ely agreed with the statement that there was enough affordable housing that is safe and well -kept in their community. Agreement was least likely among Black and Latino respondents, where only 11.5% and 19.1%, respectively, agreed/completely agreed with the statement about affordable housing , significantly lower than those of White respondents (36.5%) (Figure 34).

Racial/ethnic differences between groups noted by lettering next to the bars in the graph. Homeowner vacancy rate , which represents the proportion of the homeowner inventory that is vacant for sale, is another indicator of lack of affordability , oftentimes due to homeowners' inability to pay real estate taxes. The homeowner vacancy rate was notably higher in Hudson County (2.1%) over the period of 2016 -2020 compared to New Jersey (1.4%) (Figure 35). Vacancy rates were particularly elevated in Hoboken (3.5%) and Jersey City zip code 07307 ( 3.0%) over that time. This reality was also reflected in the interviews with residents. In the words of a Black resident, \"Prices have been slowly rising, amazing that they have money to build these new buildings but can't help people maintain the property they have here - know people who had to move because taxes were too high.\" 27.8% Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 47 Figure 35. Homeowner Vacancy Rate, by State and County, 2016 -2020 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 Housing and Technology Infrastructure Technology is an important tool to access information, services, and resources for individuals, families, and households. The importance of technology - and the consequences of the digital divide - became even more pressing and evident during the COVID -19 pandemic. The ability to be online, participants noted, is essential for residents to connect to resources for education, employment, and other services. Limited technological infrastructure posed an important barrier to learning when public schools moved to online education during COVID -19. Further, given the growth in telehealth, technology is also becoming essential to accessing healthcare. Yet some community residents do not have access to technology \u2014they are unable to afford computers or Internet acces s, or do not know how to use it. One health care provider described, \"People working online tend to be good with telehealth, but there are many who don't know how to connect, don't have what is needed, it is just as hard to get online as it is to travel. \" In 201 6-2020, about 9 3% percent of Hudson County households had access to a computer ( Figure 36). Households in Jersey City zip code 07306 (90.3%) and Bayonne (90.8%) reported computer access that was below the county -wide percentage ; with about 1 in 10 households reporting having no co mputer at home , compared to almost every household in Jersey City Jersey City (07304) Jersey City (07305) Jersey City (07306) Jersey City (07307) Jersey City (07310) Union City2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 48 Figure 36. Households with a Computer, by State, County, and Town, 2016 -2020 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 There were similar trends in household Internet access. Most of the areas that reported a lower percentage of computer access when compared to Hudson County also reported lower levels to the Internet , including Union Cit y (82.5%), and Jersey City zip codes 07304 (84.6%) and 07305 (84.7%) (Figure 37).

Transportation Infrastructure Transportation was often mentioned by focus group and intervie w participants as a top asset in Hudson County . Most participants did not indicate that they were car dependent; instead, they noted that it was easy to get around. A Latino immigrant said that \"public transportation is very good for people who don't drive; everything is close and accessible.\" Affordable and accessible p ublic transportation is important to promote equity, as it provides a means to getting to -and-from work, school, and other locations for low - income residents who cannot afford car expenses and to undocumented residents without a driver's license. Residents appreciated the proximity of Hudson County to New York City, as a source of business and economic development in the area. This is facilitated by the multiple public transportation options available to and from New York City. One resident describ ed Jersey City \"as a transportation rich area where there is a lot of income and economic opportunity, even if it is not very well distributed to everyone who lives here.\" Transportation Partnerships In addition to public transportation, several particip ants indicated that partnership between health care and social services institutions and private transportation companies were an asset and facilitated access to health care and other services and programs, particularly for older adults and violence survivors. While transportation was discussed as a significant asset among focus group and interview participants, survey respondents noted some limit ations of the transportation infrastructure. As shown in Figure 38, only about half of Hudson County survey respondents agreed or completely agreed with the statement, \"My community has transportation services available for seniors and those with disabilities .\" Similarly, slightly over half of survey respondents agreed/completely agreed that their community had transportation services to assist residents in getting to doctor 's appointments . There were no statistically significant differences in these responses by race/ethnicity. 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 50 Figure 38.

Data from the U.S. Census confirmed residents' viewpoints regarding transportation . Residents of Hudson County are a lot less car -dependent than those of Jersey City as a whole . In certain areas, such as Hoboken (52.7%) and Jersey City zip code s 07302 (56.7%) and 07310 (61.8%) , well over half of residents relied on public transportation (Figure 39). Hudson County residents were also more likely to walk to work than in the state overall, with over 7% of survey respondents reporting doing so. One focus group participant summed it up, \"Another strength [of Hudson County] is how easy it is to commute everywhere. We have the Via shuttles, Path trains, buses.\" 53.5%49.8% 54.5%52.3% 50.0%53.8% 50.0%47.1% 57.1%50.8% My community has transportation services for seniors and those with disabilitiesMy community has transportation services that assist residents in getting to doctor appointmentsWhite (n=126) (D) Hispanic/ Latino (n=68) (C) Black (n=26) (B) (n=44) (A) Total (n=273)2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 51 Figure 39. Means of Transportation to Work for Workers Aged 16+, by State, County, and Town 2016 - 2020 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 Similar to other factors, owning a private vehicle is not equally distributed across county residents. Those without a car are usually not home -owners. Acro ss Hudson County, 13.7 % of owner -occupied households and 40.6 % of renter -occupied households did not have access to a personal vehicle in 201 6- 2020 (Table 13); these percentages are much higher than in New Jersey as a whole, possibly denoting the accessibility of public transportation and Jersey City's walkability . Car ownership ranged from 9.8% in Jersey City zip code 07305 to 26.0% in Jersey City zip code 07310 among homeowners ; and from 31.5% in Bayonne to 61.2% in Jersey City Jersey City (07304) Jersey City (07305) Jersey City (07306) Jersey City (07307) Jersey City (07310) Union CityCar, truck, or van (alone) Car, truck, or van (carpooled) Public transportation Walked Other means Worked from home2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 52 Table 13.

Urban environments and physical spaces can expose people to toxins or polluta nts, affecting health conditions such as cancer, lead poisoning, and asthma. Physical space can also influence lifestyles. Playgrounds, green spaces, and trails , as well as bike lanes and safe sidewalks and crosswalks , all encourage physical activity and s ocial interaction, which can positively affect physical and mental health. Residents raised several issues related to the buil t environment. Multiple residents across focus groups expressed their concerns that there were too many new constructions. In their view, overbuilding resulted in overpopulation and shrinkage of green spaces. This issue was summed up by one resident, \"Seein g all of these new buildings that are just being built out of nowhere, blocking the view of the city, being built on green areas, parks. I understand the need to have Jersey City well developed but I think over populating is a concern. Even the smallest em pty area now has a building.\" As mentioned in the Education section, another problem mentioned by residents was that the public school infrastructure in some districts has not kept up with population growth and cannot accommodate the number of school child ren. Other residents mentioned that the older constructions ha d environmental contaminants, including lead and mold, which can have deleterious impact on health (see section on Lead ). Flooding and Emergency Preparedness Participants remarked that s everal areas of Hudson County , particularly those near the waterfront, are flood prone. A housing expert explained that p reparing the county for future floods and an overall rise in water level was an important public health precaution. A key informant interviewee in the housing sector mentioned that several urban redevelopment projects were underway to mitigate possible har m from floods and other natural disasters . The redevelopments would increas e flood storage capacity and improv e floodwater absorption . Further, the interviewee noted that new constructions are planned so as to integrate flooding mitigation and water containment measures . Redevelopment s in some area 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 53 include \"new walkways and parks available for all residents \" and building higher off the ground to prevent water damage. Parks and Green Areas Green area coverage is essential to an environment conducive to good health . Green area coverage not only contribute s to air quality and mental and physical health, but it also serve s as an important flood mitigation strategy as soil absorb s water more readily than concrete. Multiple initiatives are under way in Hudson County to improve green areas; one is the Jersey City Urban and Community Forestry to promote planting efforts and urban reforestation. A health official noted the important contribution of the Jersey City Parks Coalition to these efforts . According to the focus group participan t, the coalition is a volunteer -run grassroots organization which has spearheaded green area betterment and maintenance projects and community events , such as plantings , throughout different Jersey City neighborhood s. The participant mentioned that the y are also lead advocates for more funding for green spaces. The contributions of the Jersey City Parks Coalition were described by a public health official : \"They have worked with the city to determine a priority list, maste r plan, getting a blanket insurance policy to cover all insurance needs for events for all parks.\" According to the participant, t he coalition reflects the city's diversity and serves as a vehicle to engage different sectors of the population. Different g roups mentioned engaging in various outdoor activities. Veterans remarked on how important being involved in organized team sports was to their physical and mental health; they noted that these recreational opportunities were mainly organized by the city. Latino participants indicated walking was their main exercise and valued having access to well -lit, safe parks in their neighborhood. As with other topics, there was a diversity of experience s regarding the availability of green space. Whereas some reside nts indicated that there were plenty of green areas for outdoor activities near their homes, others mentioned not having safe parks nearby . In a participant's words, \"The inner, inner cities , I'm not sure about their parks. I have a park luckily down the street, it's a nice large park, it is safe, it's patrolled by police. But if you go up into the Greenville section , I'm not sure about those parks... it's not as lush and green as Lincoln Park o r Liberty Park.\" These differences were reflected in the community survey . About 70% of Hudson County survey respondents agreed or completely agreed with the statement, \"My community has safe outdoor places to walk and play\" ( Figure 40). However, responses significantly differed by race/ethnicity. Asian (59.1%), Black ( 61.5%), and Latino ( 64.7%) survey respondents were much less likely than White respondents (81.0%) to agre e with the statement about safe outdoor space. \"Where to play safely is not available. When Jersey City is described, it's often just the one nice part of the city, and rarely about the other quadrants.\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 54 Figure 40.

Violence Prevention and Safety Violence and trauma have short - and long -term effects on physical and mental health. People can be exposed to violence in many ways: they may be victims and suffer from premature death or injuries or witness or hear about cri me and violence in their community . Violence and trauma are inextricably linked to the social determinants of health ; people of low socioeconomic status residing in low-resource neighborhoods and schools are at higher risk of experiencing violence. According to an education administrator interviewed , many youths in low -income settings are exposed to domestic and community violence and other adverse childhood experiences , that have a profound impact on their well-being. In 2019, almost two out of every five children in New Jersey had experienced a traumatic event before the age of 18 ( Figure 41). (More localized data not available.) Violence interrupt ion professionals discussed how providing a safe and nurturing environment, access to counseling early on to address the symptoms of t rauma, and paths to educational and economic opportunities were key strategies to interrupt ing the cycle of violence. 70.3% 59.1%61.5%64.7%81.0% (ABC) Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 55 Figure 41.

Many indicated being safe in their neighborhoods , while other s reported being nervous about crime, and yet others that violence was a n \"epidemic .\" Residents' s afety concerns were generally related to gun violence , loitering, and substance use by young people . According to survey data and interviewees, p ersons of color, particularly Black residents, shoulder the burden of violent crime. Figure 42 presents survey data on the percent of respondents who agreed or completely agreed with statements related to violence in their community, overall and by race/ethnicity. Overall, 41.4% of Hudson County survey respondents agreed or completely agreed that vi olence was not prevalent in their community and 34.1 % reported that interpersonal violence was not prevalent in their community. However, responses varied by race/ethnicity , with Black survey respondents being the least likely to agree or completely agree with either of these statements. 61.0% 24.6% 14.4% No ACES 1 ACE 2 or More ACES \"We are very busy, being in Jersey City.

Racial/ethnic differences between groups noted by lettering next to the bars in the graph. Gun Injury and Violent Crime Quantitative data support residents' varied perceptions of risk . Mortality rate by firearm injury in Jersey City from 2015 -2019 was 5.4 deaths per 100,000 residents, higher than those state -wide (5.1 deaths per 100,000 residents) and in Hudson County (3.5 deaths per 100,000 residen ts). In 20 20, rates of violent crime (i.e. , murder, rape, aggravated assault) in Hudson County (280 per 100,000 residents ) were higher than in New Jersey (195 per 100,000 residents ) and varied widely across the county. Jersey City (432 per 100,000 residents ) had more than double the crime rate than the state average and 35% higher crime rate than the county overall ; Union City 's crime rates were slightly higher than Hudson County's (290 per 100,000 residents), whereas Bayonne's (177 per 100,000 residents) and Hoboken's (120 per 100,000 residents) were lower than the state and county average (Figure 43). Property crime (i.e. , burglary, larceny, and auto theft) is much more common than violent crime. Property crime in Hudson County was also above the state average (1,338 and 1,158 incidents per 100,000 persons, respectively). Property crime was most common in Union City (1,694 per 100,000 residents), Jersey City (1,457 per 100,000 residents ), and Hoboken (1,405 per 100,000 residents ) (Figure 44).

Hate Crimes and Anger It is of note that r esidents perceived a change in attitude in the aftermath of COVID -19, which they related to economic and social stressors. Specifically, several residents remarked that people had become less patient and more aggressive since the start of the pandemic . This perception was aggravated by reports of hate crimes motivated by biases against certain groups . As explained by one focus group participant, \"There's an underlying fear, suspicion, you know, not only among African Americans . I mean it wasn't that long ago that we had our own shoot ing up here at a Jewish facility . I think there is a lot of fear in regard to racism and antisemitism.\" Hate crimes were also mentioned as a concern for members of the LGBTQ+ community . A key informant interviewee working with the LGBTQ+ community noted that despite efforts, more action is needed to sensitize police officers , employers, educators, parents, and peer s so as to reduce bullying and harassment , particularly against transgend er youth and children in non -traditional families. 195.4 279.7 176.6 119.8 431.9 290.2 New Jersey City 1,158.2 1,694.1 New Jersey Hoboken Jersey City (citywide) Union City \"It's almost, I don't want to say scary, but after the pandemic , everyone is more angry, everyone wants to argue and fight. \"- Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 58 Violence Interruption Programs According to key informant interviewees, Jersey City has robust programs and resources to address and mitigate the impact of violence and trauma. Since 2014, the grassroots organization Anti-Violence Coalition has been actively working as violence interrupters in the city's South side. As expressed by a coalition member, \"We've been working ... to make an impact on the community, see what the needs are, and lobby or advocate. We've been on the ground occupying corners, conducting surveys, trying to find out the main reasons why people can't be successful in their lives due to issues in the neighborhood that wrap around violence and trauma. \" More recently, t he Jersey City Medical Center created a trauma recovery center, which is a national evidence -based model in treating survivors of violence. Additionally , Project H.U.D.S.O.N. is a Hospital -based Violence Intervention Program, associated with the center , which works with community partners to prevent reinjury and retaliatory action . According to interviewees, p romising results have been achieved b y reaching survivors at bedside , soon after injury, and provid ing trauma -informed intensive case management an d wraparound services , including support for safe housing and vocational training, in addition to medical care and counseling . Systemic Racism and Discrimination Perceptions of racism and discrimination varied in qualitative discussions. Over t discriminat ion due to race /ethnicity or nationality did not often come up . Some participants described witnessing discrimination due to gender and sexual orientation. Focus group and interview participants in multiple conversations brought up issues related to systemic racism and discrimination . With few exceptions, they spoke of pervasive inequities experienced by people of different groups . The conversations highlighted issues of intersectionalit y; participants discussed the multiplying effe ct of historical and current discriminat ory practices due to multiple conditions , such as race/ethnicity, gender, immigrant status, and socioeconomic status, among others . Participants noted these issues largely impacted communities of color because of the policies and practices embedded throughout society. Highlights from these discussions that touch upon specific topic areas (e.g., in equality, education, housing , violence prevention ) are also mentioned in other sections of this report. A theme that was discussed in most focus groups and interviews was the pervasiveness of systemic racism. One of the ways that this was noted was in the gentrification of Hudson County. Multiple participants discussed how the high cost of housing and taxes are driving people of color out of Jersey City. Both quantitative and qualitative data indicate that t here are insufficient affordable housin g units. As a Black resident described, \"A lot of the new constructions are rentals so there would be a reduction of generational wealth. Unless you're earning six figures, it will be a challenge to afford rental units in the future. What is affordable may also not be livable because of gang activity or high crime.\" Residents also noted structural racism in the perennial lack of investment in predominantly Black neighborhoods of Jersey City. They described these areas as having many abandoned buildings in a state of disrepair. Focus group and interview participants acknowledged that there has been much more dialogue about racism and discrimination over the past year. Residents indicated that there were efforts underway in Hudson County to curve at least the most over t forms of discrimination. A focus group participant expressed , \"Jersey City has definitely addressed the Asian hate crimes, even when I was on the PATH train there was a sign that was like there's no room for hate here in Chinese as wel l.\" However, other residents described instances of discrimination and mistreatment against them and their relatives due to their immigrant status. As one resident explained, \"I do feel welcome by healthcare providers, but I have experienced going with my parents who are immigrants with heavy accents, and I have experienced miscommunication.\" 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 59 Systemic Discrimination Based on Legal Status A theme that emerged in some of the interviews and focus groups was the plight of undocumented immigrants , who face multiple economic and social stressors . According to focus group participants, the community is often persecuted by safety systems and live in fear of deportation. Residents explained that undocumented immigrants do not qualify for many government programs, often fear seeking care, and have limited power to negotiate with employers and landlords for salaries and rent control. As noted by several participants, m any have experienced trauma in their home countries, made worse by unstable conditions . Further, par ticipants remarked that c hildren of undocumented parents or who themselves are undocumented often experience depression and anxiety, largely product of an uncertain future. According to residents, a pathway to legalize the situation of undocumented immigra nts to ensure they are afforded all the human rights , many who have been most of their lives in the U.S., is urgently needed to improve their life conditions. Responses also varied by survey respondents. One-quarter of Latino survey respondents indicated that they had ever been personally discriminated against when receiving medical care for their race/ethnicity and 17.6% because of language/speech issues. Asian residents were more likely to report being discriminated against for their culture/religious background (15.9%) and for language/speech issues (22.7%). Percentages for other race/ethnicities was not available due to small sample sizes . Other forms of discrimination were also mentioned in the survey. Among survey respondents, 14.1% reported having ever been discriminated against because of their age ; 14.0% because of their body size; and 16.9% because of their income level. Systemic Discrimination Based on Gender and Sexual Orientation A theme that emerged fr om the qualitative data was discrimination against the LGBTQ+ population. Members of the LGBTQ+ community reported experiencing discrimination based on gender and/or sexual orientation i n medical , educational, and professional settings. As described in the Employment section, Black trans women discussed encountering discrimination in employment due to their gender identity . An LGBTQ+ advocate emphasized more safe spaces for LGBTQ+ youth are needed in schools to prev ent bullying . Also, more education efforts are needed to sensitize parents, educators, and other adults that interact with LQBTQ+ youth to ensure a supportive environment . As noted by an activist, many educators do not have the skills to address the needs of children growing up in non -traditional families. Additional ly, the interviewee discussed how programs to sensitize and train police and healthcare providers should also be offered to promote quality, respectful care that fully addresses the diverse needs of this group , particularly of transgender individuals . One in ten survey respondents in Hudson County reported being discriminated against when receiving medical care because of their gender identity and/or sexual orientation. \"The undocumented are scared to ask for help, and we are seeing that community getting jumped overnight, not wanting to go to the hospital over what they will get charged. \" - Focus group participant \"A doctor told a lesbian woman seeking gynecological care that she didn't need checkups because she didn't have sex with men .\" - Key informant interviewee 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 60 Addressing the Systems of Oppression Quality education is a condition to overcom ing intergenerational poverty resulting from historical systems of oppression . However, residents remarked that, despite attempts to provide adequate budget s, and largely because school financing relies partly on local cost share , public schools in low -income neighborhoods of Hudson County are under - resourced . Residents noted that t he high cost of college poses another barrier for youth growing up in poverty . Further, they explained that the employment opportunities for unskilled workers do not pay a livable wage, nor offer a fixed income and benefits. In the words of a resident, \"There are jobs, I think, if you are well educated that you can sustain yourself on. But if you only have a high -school degree, it might be a bigger challenge.\" Interviewees alluded to how historical discriminatory policies against people of color, such as redlining, coupled with disinvestment and lack of educational and employment opportunities are contributing to growing inequalities and driving more people into the low -middle and low class es. Residents mentioned that some Hudson County municipalities have put in place programs to address the effects of systemic racism, such as first-time homeowner program s for low-income residents , rent control policies , and programs to promote minority and/or woman owned business es. However, participants emphasized that more policies and programs to promote equity and reverse this trend are urgently needed. \"The South side is a beautiful part of town, we've got some issues in some areas because of systemic racism and lack of investment, but it's a beautiful part of town .\" - Key informant interviewee 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 61 Community Health Issues Understanding community health issues is a critical step in the CHNA process. The disparities seen in these issues mirror the historical patterns of structural, economic, and racial inequit ies experienced for generations across the county and the U.S. Community Perceptions of Health Understanding residents' perceptions of health helps provi de insights into lived experiences, including into the key health concerns and facilitators and barriers to addressing health conditions. When asked about top concerns in their co mmunity, focus group participants and interviewees identified social and economic issues such as financial and food insecurity , and housing - and how these were associated with ch ronic conditions that affect many members of the community, including high - blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes . Challenges to accessing healthcare, largely due to cost, was also a top concern among residents. Another issue discussed by multiple groups, was the increase in mental health disorders among th e entire population, but particularly among youth, seniors, and veterans . Other issues that were mentioned included a rise in community and domestic violence, an increase in sexually transmitted infections , and challenges to women's health , the latter in t he context of the wave of legal decisions that curtail reproductive rights . Survey respondents were presented with a list of specific issues and had the ability to add issues not listed. They were asked to mark the top three health concerns or issues for their community. They also were given the option to write in other issues not listed. This feedback complements quantitative data concerning health status and conditions. As shown in Figure 45, mental health, overweight/obesity, and high stress lifestyle were the top three issues noted among survey respondents. This was slightly different than results of the same survey in 2019. In that 2019 s urvey, obesity was the number one community health concern selected by survey respondents, followed by diabetes and then (tied) substance use and mental health. While mental health, overweight/obesity, and high stress lifestyle were the top three communit y health concerns among respondents in the recent survey, d ifferences appear ed by race/ethnicity. While respondents identifying as Asian, Latino, and White shared the three priority health topics describe d above, Black respondents ' top priority area was violence/community safety, followed by mental health issues, and adequate and affordable housing ( Figure 46). \"Diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity in this community is a proble m [among ] people who have a difficult time affording food \"- Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 62 Figure 45.

Leading Causes of Death and Premature Mortality Mortality rates help to measure the burden and impact of disease on a population, while premature mortality data (deaths before age 75 years old) provide a picture of preventable deaths and point to areas where additional health and public health interventions may be warranted. The most current mortality data are available for the period 2018-2020, which includes the first year of the COVID -19 pandemic. The a ge-adjusted mortality rate per 100,000 Hudson County residents was 672.6 in this period ( Figure 47); 7% below the mortalit y rate in New Jersey during the same time period. Figure 47.

Additional leading causes of death include d unintentional injury ( such as unintentional poisonings including drug overdoses, unintentional motor vehicle accidents, unintentional drownings, and falls), stroke, and chronic lower respiratory disease (CLRD - e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma). It is important to note the deleterious impa ct of COVID -19 on mortality , which became the second cause of death in both the state and the county. The mortality rate by COVID - 19 in Hudson County was 46% higher than in the state . Additional data on unintentional injury can be found in Appendix F- Additional Data Tables . Figure 48.

Overweight and Obesity As discussed earlier in the Perceptions of Community Health section, obesity was cited as the second top health concern in the community in the survey (after mental health). However, it was not discussed at length in the focus groups or interviews by participants. Instead, residents from diverse population groups commented on the chronic conditions that are linked to obesity, particularly di abetes , and described how these conditions were prevalent in the community from a very young age . They discussed the social and economic challenges to maintaining a healthy lifestyle , including buying healthy food, access issues in living in a food desert, barriers to seeking medical care, having safe and accessible green space for activity , and time constraints . (See sections related to Food Access and the Built Environment for survey data and surveillance data on perceptions and the landscape related to t he food and physical activity environment.) The latest surveillance data on overweight/obesity is from several years ago. Adults at the state and county level were asked to self -report their height and weight. Based on this self -report, about one in four adults in Hudson County were considered obese , comparable to New Jersey ( Figure 50). In the current community survey for this CHNA, survey respondents were asked to indicate whether they or a ho usehold family member were ever told by a doctor or health professional that they had a 408.7 208.6 146.8 Indian/ Native Asian, Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic Hispanic/ Latino White, Non-HispanicNew Jersey Hudson County2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 66 weight problem ( Figure 51). Among these respondents, almost half ( 46.9%) indicated yes, although responses varied by race/ethnicity . Nearly three in four (72.7%) Black respondents reported this, significantly higher than Asian (41.7%) and Latino (41.0%) respondents. Figure 50.

Participants remarked that physical activity was impor tant for maintaining both physical and mental health. A focus group participant explained the importance of exercise for those experiencing mental health problems and to address isolation, \"I wish more veterans would take advantage of opportunities for umpiring and make a little money on the side - I do various leagues, swimming, softball, baseball . [There are] a lot of opportunit ies for veterans that are just coming out of a mental health area, whereas they want a different avenue to go to, and be part of the community which a lot of veterans try to isolate ... But this is something where you can just come out and do , be a part of the community with fellow veterans, you know. \" Community survey respondents were asked if they were physically active, and nearly 7 8% indicated y es (Figure 52). However, Black and Latino survey respondents were less likely to say that they were currently physically active, with only 6 9.2% and 72.3% saying yes, respectively, a lower proportion when compared to White respondents ( 84.9%). As discussed earlier in this report, Black and Latino survey respondents were also significantly less likel y than White respondents to indicate that there were safe outdoor places to walk and play in their community. Community survey respondents who were parents also indicated whether they would describe their children as physically active or sedentary after sc hool or on weekends . About 78% of Hudson County parent survey respondents described their children as physically active, with 2 1.8% describing them as sedentary. In comparison, only 53.6% of Latino parents indicated their children were physically active. Data is not available for Asian and Black parents. Figure 52.

These data sources collect data on whether respondents had no leisure time activity. Across the state and by county, the percentages of those with no leisure time physical activity were higher in 2018 than in 2014 ( Figure 53). In Hudson County, 29.4 % of adults reported having no leisure time in 2018, compared to 25.3 % in in 2014. Surveillance data from 201 6 to 20 20, by race/ethnicity indicate d that Latino respondents were most likely to report having no leisure physical activity time (32.8%) (Figure 54). Data on access to adequate location to engage in physical activity can be found in Figure 133 in the Appendix. Figure 53.

These difficulties included lack of availability and affordability of healthy foods, depending on food provided by schools or food pantries, living in a \"food desert,\" and not having access t o a kitchen to cook healthier meals for the family. However, other participants mentioned that there were healthy food outlets available in Hudson County. During COVID -19, multiple participants remarked that the community came together to ensure access to healthy foods to those affected by the pandemic via food drives and delivery of healthy food boxes or supermarket gift cards. Residents also noted that low-income seniors could receive food vouchers . In addition, Jersey City Medical Center has a healthy fo od pantry which serves people facing food insecurity, many of whom are seniors. Current surveillance data on fruit and vegetable consumption is not available for Hudson County. New Jersey data indicate that 19.1% of New Jersey adults reported in 2017 that they ate vegetables less than one time per day and 33.6% of New Jersey adults reported eating fruit less than one time per day, according to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey. Eating breakfast daily is an important start to a healthy day. However, c urrent data from the CHNA community survey shows differences by race/ethnicity . Among respondents living with a child, o nly about three -quarters of Black and Lat ino survey respondents (78.6% and 71.4%, respectively) reported that their children eat breakfast daily, significantly fewer than White respondents (97.6%) who se children did so ( Figure 55).

Chronic disease s are also a contributing factor to poor mental health . As a healthcare provider noted, \"There's a lot of depression surrounding getting diagnosed with one of those [chronic] illnesses. They have access to those programs, but they feel beaten down because of misinformation. When they get more information, they feel that they can manage it. The diagnosis can feel like a death sentence sometimes. \" Although chronic diseases are among the most common and costly health problems, they are also among the most preventable through changes in behavior such as reduced use of to bacco and alcohol and improved diet and physical activity. The following section describes the health data (e.g., screening, incidence, mortality, etc.) related to chronic conditions. High Cholesterol and High Blood Pressure Multiple focus group and inter view participants mentioned high cholesterol and hypertension as prevalent in the community , including among children. High cholesterol and high blood pressure are significant risk factors for heart disease, stroke, and other chronic diseases.29 Community survey respondents in spring/summer 2021 were asked about their participation in different types of health screenings over the past two years ( Figure 56). Many respondents (70.0%) in Hudson County indicated that they have received a cholesterol screening, and 86.4% had participated in a blood pressure screening. Black respondents were significantly more likely than Asian , Latino , and White respondents to indicate that they had participated in either type of screening over the past two years. Figure 56.

Approximately 71% and 77% of Hudson County survey respondents indicated that they or member of their family had been told by a health professional that they have high cholesterol and blood pressure , respectively (Figure 57). Black respondents, with the highest rates of both, were significantly more likely than Asian , Latino, or Black respondents to indicate that they or a family member ha d high cholesterol or high blood pressure.

Heart Disease While focus group and interview participants did not directly discuss heart disease, it is the leading cause of death in Hudson County , and closely associated with other conditions mentioned by resident s such as diabetes, high cholesterol, and lifestyle . In the following graph, surveillance data are presented on the numbe r of adults visiting the emergency department for major cardiovascular disease . In 2016 -2020, the rate of heart disease emergency department (ED) visits per 10,000 population in Hudson County was 169.6 visits and the rate of heart disease hospitalizations per 10,000 population was 256.3 , similar to state rates ( (C) White (n=61) (D) Total Asian (n=27) (A) (n=15) (B) Hispanic/ Latino White (n=66) (D)High Cholesterol High Blood Pressure2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 72 Figure 58.

At the county level, the highest percentage was reported by Latino residents (4.3%), higher than the percentage at county and state level. However, data for Black residents was not reliable due to small sample sizes. Figure 59.

Across the state, the overall mortality per 100,000 was 162. 8 and was highest among Black (194 per 100,000) and White (17 2 per 100,000) residents, as well as male (206.7 per 100,000) residents (Figure 60). At the county level, the overall cardiovascular disease mortality per 100,000 was 147, lower t han in the state. Like New Jersey, mortality was highest among Black (194 per 100,000) and White (187 per 100,000) , as well as male (189 per 100,000) residents . Figure 60.

Participants indicated observing an increase in rates of diabetes in recent years and noted that diabetes was highly prevalent in their communities, starting at a young age. A Latino focus group participant described it as, \"Everyone, even children , has diabetes ... What is in the air for everyone to have diabetes?\" Focus group participants attributed the increase in diabetes rates to stress associated with social and economic factors , such as affordable healthy living and access to good healthcare. As one focus group participant stated, \"Diabetes is a very expensive issue in the community, and we'll often see people forgo their medication because they can't afford it or forgo healthy foods because they can't afford it .\" A theme that emerged strongly from participants was the urgent need to address the upstream causes of disease to reduce the incidence of diabetes and other chronic disease among low -income communities and persons of Male FemaleRace/Ethnicity GenderNew Jersey Hudson County2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 74 The following figure shows the percent of adults that reported a diagnosis of diabetes overall and by race/ethnicity from 2016 to 20 20, the most recent that surveillance data is available. In New Jersey, 9.2% of adults reported a diabetes diagnosis. This p ercentage was highest among Black, Non -Hispanics (1 4.7%), followed by Asian, Non -Hispanics (12.1%) and Hispanic/Latino (12. 4%), and lowest among White, Non - Hispanics (6.7%) ( Figure 61). A higher percentage of adults were diagnosed with diabetes in Hudson County (11.5%). Of note, whereas county rates among Black (14.1%) and White (6.9%) residents were comparable to those of the state , Latinos in Hudson County (13.5%) had higher rates and Asians had much lower rates (0.7%) than in New Jersey.

However, cancer incidence and mortality are close ly associated with the social determinants of health. Screening and early detection is a critical strategy to reduce premature deaths and is strongly li nked to access to care. Further, lifestyle factors are the most significant risks of developing cancer . Exposure to carcinogen s in the built environment , the water, the air, and the soil, because of daily activities at home , school , and the workplace , increases the risk of developing cancer . In addition, a healthy lifestyle - maintaining a healthy diet and weight, and not smoking or consum ing alcohol, are preventative factors ; as discussed in other sections of the report, some population groups face substantial barriers to sustaining a healthy lifestyle. 9.2%11.5%12.4% 0.7%14.7%14.1% 12.4%13.5% 6.7% 6.9% New Jersey Hudson CountyOverall Asian, Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic Hispanic/Latino White, Non-Hispanic \"We seem taken aback by how prevalent these chronic diseases are so much so that when somebody's first diagnosed , many times they don't even react to it like, \"Yeah , well, my father had it , my mother had it , my friends have it , and now I have it .\" It's normalized and I think that's a shame .

Across the state, the overall mortality per 100,000 was 1 41.1 and was highest among Black, Non -Hispanics (16 1.5 per 100,000) and White , Non-Hispanics (15 0.6 per 100,000) (Figure 62). The overall cancer mortality rate in Hudson County (121.1 per 100,000) was lower than in the state . Most racial/ethnic groups in Hudson County, had cancer mortality rate s comparable to those in New Jersey . However, Black residents' cancer mortality rate (182.9 per 100,000) in Hudson County , was higher than in New Jersey.

It is the most prevalen t disease in the grouping of chronic lower respiratory disease s (CLRD), the sixth leading cause of death in Hudson County in 20 20. Data are presented on the rate of emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations for COPD per 10,000 population at the state and county level from 201 6-2020. The state overall had a rate of 3, 299 ED visits and 9 39 hospitalizations per 10,000 population ( Figure 75). Hudson County had a rate of 3,477 ED visits, a rate higher than the state , and 925 hospitalizations per 10,000 population , slightly below the state - wide rate. DATA SOURCE: New Jersey Department of Health, Office of Health Care Quality Assessment, New Jersey Data Collection System, as reported by New Jersey State Health Assessment Data (NJSHAD), 2016 -2020 Disability Residents who have some type of disability may have difficu lty getting around, living independently, or completing self-care activities. Other disabilities, such as hearing impairment, vision impairment, and cognitive impairment, may also impact residents ' daily lives. Disabilities affec t people of all ages and are most prevalent among older adults. While the issue of disabilities did not emerge often in the qualitative interviews , many people with disabilities face economic instability as they rely on government financial assistance pr ograms for their basic needs . In New Jersey, the Divisions of Developmental Disabilities (DDD) and Disability Services' (DDS) provide support for individuals until they turn 21, and after individuals reach age 60, they can access resources from the Office of Aging and Disability. In addition, it is often challenging for parents of children with disabilities to navigate the education and healthcare system , particularly if they have limited English abilities . Even obtaining a diagnosis may be difficult . For middle and low -income residents, affording care for children with disabilities is also a barrier.

Hospitalizations due to COPD per 10,000, by State and County, 2016 -2020 \"It's called early intervention, where students are identified early . So, if they or the pediatrician notices that there's some developmental delays, we pick them up. We provide services from preschool on through 21 .\" - Key informant interviewee 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 83 expressed that there were supportive services for children with special needs starting in preschool to age 21. Howe ver, developmental delays are not always easy to diagnose . Further, there are insufficient special education teachers to meet the need. Data on the civilian noninstitutionalized population by age show that almost four percent of children under 18 years o ld (3.5%) , almost eight percent of 18-64-year -old adults (7.7%) , and 30.6% of people 65 or older had a disability in New Jersey in 2016 -2020 (Figure 76). At the county level, 3. 7% of children under 18 years old, 6.4% of 18-to-64-year -old adults, and 32.9% of adults 65 years of age and ol der had a disability in Hudson County. Bayonne had the highest proportion of children living with a disability (5.8%) in 2016 -2020 ; in Jersey City zip code 07304, almost 1 in 10 adults aged 18 -64 had a disability (9.1%); and in Union City more than 2 in 5 (40.7%) adults 65 and older were living with a disabili ty.

In the field, mental health and substance use are typically discussed under the larger framework of behavioral hea lth. Mental Health Mental health was identified as a top community health concern. The topic of mental health arose in almost all conversations conducted for this CHNA. Interviewees and focus group members noted that while mental health has been a longstanding health concern, the COVID -19 pandemic has made the issue more pressin g. In the words of a Latino focus group participant, \"The pandemic had an adverse effect on everyone \u2014children, teens, and adults \u2014and there have been many people affected psychologically.\" Job loss and economic pressures, virtual schooling, social isolation , and the uncertainty associated with the pandemic were all cited as contributors to increased stress, depression, and trauma among Hudson County residents. At the same time, gun violence has also taken a toll on individual and collective psyches . In addit ion, poor mental health is often co -morbid with chronic conditions, which are highly prevalent in the population. Among community survey respondents, mental health was the top community health issue with 3 0.9% of respondents identifying it as an area of concern, as noted previously in the Perceptions of Community Health section. Stigma and Access to M ental Health Care While mental health issues affected people of all ages, races, and genders, mental health for veterans , unhoused individuals, children and youth, seniors, trans persons, Latino residents, immigrants, and low - income adults were highlighted in the qualitative discussions. Focus group participants noted that anxiety and depression were prevalent in the community and mentioned several barriers to care. Participants highlighted stigma associated with mental health as a hindrance . Participants observed that many people affected by mental health did not recogniz e mental health as a medical condition, and this was particularly so among the foreign -born population , veterans , and Black residents . As a focus group participant and veteran described, \"We find that to be a problem, that our veterans don't ask for help, because they're so darn self-sufficient and a little stubborn.\" A key informant interview ee who self - identified as Black explained that for \"those of African descent, counseling was not something that we did.\" Mental Health and Economic Instability Poor mental health is closely associated with economic and housing instability , as described in the section on Employment . Focus group veteran participants expressed that not having employment that afforded them a living wage was a major cause of anxiety and depression. Latino residents in the focus groups shared stories about the challenges of losing their jobs, paying the rent, and feed ing their families. An advocate for the LGBTQ+ community described high levels of stress and depression among transgender residents due to unemployment. \"The first problem is getting people to recognize the need, it's a national problem, with the advertising that it 's okay to ask for help .\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 85 Mental Health and Trauma Trauma is defined as a person's emotional response to a distressing event or series of events, including experiencing or witnessing violence, abuse and neglect in childhood, and war, among others . A person can have a range of psychological and physical symptoms following trauma that can dramatically hinder well-being and daily functioning, and can, in severe case s, develop post -traumatic stress disorder. As described in detail in the section on Violence Prevention and Safety , communit ies of color have experienced an undue burden of multiple forms of intergenerational, childhood, and adult trauma . As noted earlier, violence and community safety was the top health priority for Black survey respondents. Survivors of violence face many barriers to accessing mental health care. Key informant interviewees explained that m any trauma survivors come from cultures and environments that stigmatize mental health conditions. Others experi ence economic barriers to accessing care. Focus group participants and interviewees highlighted the urgent need to provide trauma informed care and to expand access to counseling and allied services for persons recovering from trauma in Hudson County . A focus group participant described the dire situation of mothers o f gun violence victims , \"We met with a group of moms whose children were all impacted by gun violence where the child was lost or criminally involved, the moms decided to get together and suppo rt each other. I asked what they did and they said , \"We just gather and wait for the next support victim .\" These women were in trauma themselves, looking to help others but not able to help themselves .\" Since 2020, JCMC's Trauma Recovery Center, a national evidence -based model to treating survivors of violence , has address ed some of the need . The model is based on providing trauma -informed medical care to violence survivors, in addition to counseling to alleviat e trauma symptoms , and linkage to community resources to address survivors' most immediate needs, including relocation, employment, and housing support, among others. Mental Health and the COVID -19 Pandemic The COVID -19 pandemic had devastating consequences on mental health across many sectors of the population. The pandemic contributed to anxiety, depression, and stress. Partly due to fear of the virus and uncertainty , partly due to the financial impact, and partly due to isolation. Further, many community members lost loved ones due to COVID -19. I nterviewees who work ed with seniors talked about isolation and loneliness among older residents, which was harder during the pandemic when senior centers and other social outlets closed . Many residents noted that children and youth were particularly affected as schools closed and they were isolated from their friends and social environment. They indicated that this was compounded by parents' increased stress levels due to uncertainty and financial worries. Participants mentioned that y outh exposed to domestic violence were particularly affected by stay-at-home orders. Suicide ideation among teenagers was mentioned by sev eral participants. A public health official summed up the situation of young people during the pandemic, \"They weren't in school through the whole pandemic and, you know, perhaps they're at home with an alcoholic father, or abusive mother, or you know, or no one at all. I think the kids are suffering probably the most as a community.\" \"We need more services because people are not getting the help they need ...\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 86 Those working in the health sector talked about the mental health of their staff who have faced tremendous pressure when responding to the pandemic . As an interviewe e from public health described, \"[Mental health] is a problem, I think , especially after Covid ... We were all, you know, as a community , at home . Even me , I wasn't at work , but I was working from home you know, 24 /7, 7 days a week . So, I definitely think mental health is a big issue. .. You have to understand what it is to be doing that all the time .\" Reiterating the impact of the pandemic on mental health, 43.9% of survey respondents reported that they or someone in their family ha d personally experienced difficulty with maintaining a good mental state, while 3 5.1% reported being lonely or isolated from others since COVID -19 began ( Figure 77). More than half of Latino respondents (55.9%) reported that they or a family member had difficulty maintaining a good mental state during COVID -19, significantly more than Black (26.9%) and White (48.0%) respondents. Black respondents (23.1%) were the least likely of all race/ethnic groups to report being isolated. Figure 77.

The overall county rate was slightly higher than at state level (63.1 per 100,000 in Hudson County vs. 60.8 per 100,000 in New Jersey ) (Figure 80). The mental health -related hospitalization rate was highest among the Black population in both the state (94.6 per 100,000) and the county (107.1 per 100,000) , followed by White residents (61.5 per 100 ,000 in New Jersey and 66.9 per 100,000 in Hudson County ). County -level rates for mental health hospitalization of Latino and Asian residents were both lower in Hudson County than in New Jersey . Figure 80.

Rates among Asians were lower in the county than in the state , but higher among the other racial/ethnic groups . White reside nts had the highest suicide rate s in the county (10.5 per 100,000), nearly double those of Black (5.9 per 100,000) and Latino (5.2 per 100,000) residents (Figure 81). Figure 81.

Pediatric mental health -related hospitalization rates in Hudson County were more than double among Black children (34.7 per 100,000) compared to the follo wing group, White children (16.3 per 100,000 ) (Figure 82).

First, even for residents who do seek help, they are not aware of where to obtain it. Second, participants noted that there were insufficient mental health service providers in Hudson County to meet the demand , particularly those that can provide culturally compe tent services to the diverse population, including gender non-binary people, non -English speakers, and veterans. This leads to long waiting times. As described by a focus group participant, \"From the behavioral health side, due to staff shortages and high demand, we've had to limit community referrals and take from within the hospital to treat the most acute clients. Those others who need mental health support, we don't have the bandwidth to help them right now.\" A health administrator described the e fforts made to hire culturally competent staff , \"Not only is it hard finding behavioral health staff, but we also try to mirror the staff we hire, bilingual staff are unicorns because they are hard to find.

JCMC and other pro viders began offering services via telehealth to expand access during the pandemic. However, whereas this strategy worked with certain groups, others without access to technology or with lower digital literacy, did not benefit . Participants mentioned that s chools often identify and connect students to mental health services, but school nurse and student support/counseling offices are understaffed. As one public school administrator expressed , \"We've been trying through the schools with our re sources to really embed more social, emotional, not just the mental health, but before it gets to the mental health , helping students overcome challenges , developing resilience , by b eing able to speak about their emotions .\" However, staffing is limited , as are the mental health services that schools can provide. Data are presented on the ratio of population to mental health providers in 2019. At the state level, there were 450 people for every mental health provider ( Figure 83). In Hudson County, the ratio was 1570 people for every mental health provider. The dearth of mental health providers in Hudson County likely worsened during the pandemic. Figure 83. Ratio of Population to Mental Health Providers, by State and County, 2019 DATA SOURCE: National Provider Identification Regi stry, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, as reported by County Health Rankings, University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2019 Substance Use Substance use was mentioned as a community health concern in conversation s this year, as it was in prior CHNAs. Problem s ubstance use was described as affecting all groups, across all socioeconomic levels . However, i t was mentioned specifically in conversations in the context of unhoused individuals, vete rans, and young people ; some reported that problem substance u se is more hidden among youth in higher income communities. Several participants reported that substance use, particularly alcohol and opioid use, has increased as a result of economic and socia l stressors . Further, overdose deaths among young people were also noted as a health concern. A healthcare provider remarked , \"I'll say for us the top conditions that we tend to get a lot of are readmissions for drug s overdose , heroin, opioids, and alcohol . And it's always the same people who keep coming a nd coming .\" Some participants mentioned substance use associated with safety concerns, particularly among youth who consume substances. A Latino resident provided the following example , \"When I wait for the bus, there are young people doing drugs or drinking alcohol nearby and that scares me a lot .\" Data for prevalence of s ubstance use , substance -use related mortality, and substance use treatment is presented in the sections below. 450:11570 :1 New Jersey Hudson County2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 91 Alcohol Use Focus group and interview participants discussed that they were concerned about alcohol consumption as a problem in the community , particularly given difficulty accessing long -term treatment services . Alcohol use is also a contributing factor t o other preva lent health conditions, including cardiovascular disease, depression , and violence . Data aggregated for 201 7 to 2020 show binge drinking levels - defined as a drinking pattern that brings blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 percent or higher , typically by consuming four or more drinks (female), or five or more drinks (male) in a two-hour period - for the state and county and by race/ethnicity. In New Jersey, 16. 9% of adults reported binge drinking. This percentage was highest among White (20.5%), followed by Latino (16.1%), Black (12. 6%), and Asian (8.8%) residents (Figure 84). At the county level, 1 7.6% of adults in Hudson County reported binge drinking, with the highest percentage among White (27.2%) residents , followed by Latino (15.8%), Black (11.9%), and Asian (8.1%) residents . Of driving deaths over the period 2015 -2019, 22.8% were due to drinking under the influence of alcohol in New Jersey, and 18.1% in Hudson County. Figure 84.

Others expressed concern about the long -term implications of marijuana legalization on substance use trends in the community. The following figure shows the age -adjusted drug poisoning mortality rate per 100,000 population in 2016 and 20 20. In New Jersey, the age -adjusted rate per 100,000 was 23.2 in 201 6 and 32. 1 in 20 20 (Figure 86). The Hudson County rates were lower than the state, with mortality rates per 100,000 at 14.0 in 201 6 and 21.6 in 20 20. Similar trends are also presented in Figure 87 for unintentional drug induced poisoning mortality per 100,000. Figure 86.

When looking at the percentage of adults who are current smokers, Figure 89 show s that in New Jersey, 1 1.8% of adults were current smok ers in 2017 -2020 . This percentage was highest among Black (14.4%) and Latino (14.2%) residents , followed by White (12.0%) and Asian (6.8%) residents . At the county level, 14.2% of residents reported currently smoking overall. Proportionally , more Black residents reported smoking (22.5%) compared to Latino (13.6%), Whit e (13.5%), and Asian (8.1%) adults in Hudson County . Of note, the proportion of Blac k Hudson County residents who smoked was markedly higher than the county average and of Black smokers in the state. Figure 89.

Participants advocated for more local programs, including community -based recovery programs. Several participants mentioned the problem of relapse due t o inadequate treatment programs. The disruption in mental health services due to the COVID -19 pandemic further increased the risk of relapse. As a health administrator noted, \"We can detox folks here, but we can't provide addictions treatment. We can detox people over and over again, and we do, that happens in substance abuse treatments, but not having a better solution to move from detox into a 21 -day program or something similar is a problem we've seen for years ... we need a seamless transition between \" the facilities, short -term, and long -term treatment programs . The following figure shows the percentage of substance use treatment admissions by primary drug in 2020. At the state level, 4 2.0% of admissions were for heroin, 31.0% for alcohol, and under 10% each for marijuana, cocaine, other opiates, and other drugs ( Figure 90). In the Hudson County treatment sites, 39.0% of admissions were for heroin, 26.0% for alcohol, 1 9.0% for marijuana, and under 10% each for other opiates, cocaine, and other drugs. Figure 90.

Environmental factors are various and far reaching and include exposure for hazardous substances in the ai r, water, soil , or food; natural disasters and climate change; and the built environment. Asthma Asthma in children was one of the conditions mentioned in the focus groups and interviews as a community problem and as a major cause of missed school days . Public health data typically show that 1 in 13 adults has asthma , and it disproportionately affects low -income communities and communities of color.30 Perceptions of asthma as a community problem are supported by quantitative data. Data are presente d on the rate of asthma hospitalizations per 100,000 population in 20 20. The following figure shows that the age-adjusted rate was 1 ,064 per 100,000 persons in New Jersey and 80 2 per 100,000 persons in Hudson County (Figure 92). 30 https://www.aafa.org/asthma -facts/ 23.0%27.0% Other, Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 96 DATA SOURCE: DATA SOURCE: New Jersey Discharge Data Collection System, Office of Health Care Quality Assessment, New Jersey Department of Health, New Jersey State Health Assessment Data (NJSHAD), 2018 and 2020 NOTE: Includes all asthma diagnoses, including primary, secondary, and other diagnoses.

At state and county levels , Black residents shared a disproportionate burden of asthma ED visits. State -wide, Black, Non-Hispanics had the highest rate of ED visits (89.0 per 10,000), followed by Hispanics/Latinos (32.3 per 10,000), White, Non -Hispanics (13.1 per 10,000), and Asian, Non -Hispanics (3.5 per 10,000 ). Trends in Hudson County were similar to those state -wide, albeit slightly lower for all race/ethnicities. The highest rate in Hudson County was among Black, Non -Hispanics (7 3.0 per 10,000), followed by Hispanics/Latinos (17.1 per 10,000), White, Non -Hispanics (11.4 per 10,000), and Asian, Non -Hispanics (3.3 per 10,000).

This is a decrease compared to ozone air quality from 2014 -2019 ; however, it is a possibility that COVID -19 impacted these rates as more people spent time indoors and less time traveling ( Figure 95). Data on air quality show a n average daily density of fine particulate of 9.3 micrograms per cubic meter in Hudson County, slightly higher than the state average (8.1) (Figure 96). Whereas air quality was not a n issue of frequent concern for most participants, a few did remark on vehicular traffic as a source of pollution , particularly in certain neighborhoods . 3.5 3.389.0 73.0 32.3 17.113.1 11.4 New Jersey Hudson CountyAsian, Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic Hispanic/Latino White, Non-Hispanic \"The New Jersey Turnpike extension ... is a constant construction hazard .

Exposure to lead among young children, through touching lead dust or paint chips , for example, can harm children's health, including potential damage to the brain and nervous system, slowed growth and development, and hearing and speech problems. As shown in Figure 97, most of the housing in Hudson County (68.4 %) was built prior to 1980 , which is a slightly higher percentage than in New Jersey (65.7%) . In 2022 , New Jersey released new state regulations mandating visual inspections of all rental units built prior to 1 978; however, a public health official noted the challenge of implementing such regulations given the number of older housing and the available human resources.

COVID -19 COVID -19 was not extensively discussed in conversations around infectious and communicable diseases. When it was addressed, focus group and interview participants primarily discussed how COVID -19 and the shutdown of businesses and schools had exacerbated the social and economic inequities that already existed. Participants noted that i ncome loss during COVID-19, coupled with inflation , was a major source of stress, anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. Parents of school children also had to face the challenges of remote schooling , and participants talked about the increase in mental health d isorders among children due to isolation. Participants associated the stress -related to COVID -19 on an increase in domestic violence cases. The socioeconomic impacts of COVID -19 were discussed extensively in prior sections (see , for example, the Inequality, Education, Employment and Workforce , and Income and Financial Security sections ). Additionally, many in the healthcare fields noted a significant disruption in access to services, particularly in preventive care. They remarked that patients we re afraid of seeking care and only did so for emergencies. Several focus group participants observed that COVID -19 had become normalized and were worried that people were not taking the proper precautions, such as masking, to prevent the spread of COVID -19. In terms of COVID -19 testing, there were diverse experiences; whereas some kn ew of free COVID -19 testing sites, others did not. For the latter, cost was a barrier to COVID -19 testing. Since April 2020 until September 2022 , there have been 2.3 million confirmed cases of COVID -19 in New Jersey and nearly 1 90,000 in Hudson County. Cases have fluctuated from January 2020 throughout 2022; notable peaks in cases per day across New Jersey include April 5, 2020 (>4,000 cases), January 4 , 2021 (>6,700 cases), and December 27 , 2021 ( >43,000 cases). Below, Figure 99 shows new confirmed cases per day per 100,000 population on the first of the month from March 202 2 through August 202 2. \"[COVID impacted] housing, food insecurity, jobs, people have a fear of going back to work, and childcare , because there was a time when everything was virtual, how can parents afford to stay home and put food on the table ?\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 101 Figure 99. New COVID -19 Cases per 100,000 pop ulation, by State and County, 2022 DATA SOURCE: New Jersey Department of Public Health, COVID -19 Dashboard, 202 2 According to data from the New Jersey Department of Public Health, a s of August 10, 2022, there were 31,27 5 deaths from COVID -19 in New Jersey and 2,546 in Hudson County. There are racial/ethnic disparities among COVID -19 deaths in New Jersey. While Black residents ma de up 12.4 % of the New Jersey population, they accounted for 1 6.6% of COVID -19 deaths in the state (Figure 100). Of note, 59.8 % of COVID -19 deaths occurred among White residents, even though they only make up 51. 9% of the population. This could potentially be due to the large numbers of White residents aged 65 and older, compared to other racial/ethnic groups . Figure 100. COVID -19 Confirmed Deaths, by Race/Ethnicity, by State, 2022 DATA SOURCE: New Jersey Department of Public Health, COVID -19 Dashboard, updated 8/29/2022 As of July 2 7, 202 2, about 6.8 million individuals in New Jersey ha d been fully vaccinated, representing around 76.5 % of the population ; Hudson County had reported over half a million fully vaccinated individuals , which is about 80.8 % of the population (Table 14).

Many participants also expressed concerns about shrinking reproductive rights with the recent overturn of Roe vs. Wade, and the negative impact that would have on women's health , particularly in terms of the inequitable burden o n low -income women . Participants reported increase s in incident HIV/AIDS cases during the pandemic and decreases in linkage to care for those persons living with HIV/AIDS. In addition, participants noted that the incidence of other ST Is, such as syphilis, had also increased since the pandemic . Limited knowledge related to free testing sites in the population was mentioned as a barrier to timely diagnosis and management. In addition, the cost of treatment , even for insured patients, was brought up as a challenge for middle -low and low -income residents. Another concern raised by participants was the increase in ST Is among young people. As part of the discussion, participants cited parents' lack of awareness of the problem, including in affluent neighborhoods as a main barrier to prevention . Participants raised the absence of comprehensive sexual ity education in schools as another impediment to safe sex . According to participants, comprehensive sexuality education provides critical information on healthy sexuality and reproduction and serves to empower adolescents to make choices regarding their health . As residents noted, access to information is of utmost importance in the current climate of curtailing legal prote ctions to reproductive choice . HIV transmission data was not available for the county but for the state overall. The rate of HIV transmission for Black residents in New Jersey was 30.2 per 100,000 persons, which was ten times the rate of transmission for White residents ( 3.1 per 100,000) and over three times the rate for all New Jersey residents ( 9.9 per 100,000) ( Figure 102). Hispanic/Latino residents had a n HIV transmission rate of 18.4 per 100,00 persons, almost two times greater than that of N ew Jersey residents. \"One thing we have to prevent HIV is PrEP, but we don't know if everyone knows we have it, or where to get tested for free, or even if they should get tested ... Clients who come in late have passed through areas of healthcare where they've not been tested, so access and education is something we need. \" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 104 Figure 102.

In 20 21, there were 2,610 cases of Chlamydia per 100,000 population in New Jersey among females aged 15 -24, and the case rate was greater for Hudson County ( 2,918 per 100,000 ) (Figure 103). Hudson County reported similar levels of Gonorrhea among people under age 35 , (213 per 100,000) and Hepatitis B ( 63 per 1000,000) compared to New Jersey overall ( 210 and 62 persons per 100,000 persons , respectively).

Crude rate. Maternal and Infant Health The health and well -being of mothers, infants, and children are important indicators of community health . Maternal and infant health indicators are considered markers of inequit y as most maternal and perinatal health complications are preventable with access to quality, adequate timely care. Whereas participants did not discuss issues related to maternity and newborn care, they did bring up multiple barriers to accessing care , which may have impeded or severely reduced access to this life saving intervention. 2609.5 209.662.12918.0 212.862.7 Chlamydia (females ages 15-24) Gonorrhea (under age 35) Hepatitis C (Acute & Chronic), 2020New Jersey Hudson County 5.39.815.416.5 2016 2021New Jersey Hudson County2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 106 Prenatal Care Prenatal care is an evidenced -based intervention to improve maternal and perinatal health outcomes. Statewide, nearly three in four births had prenatal care within the first trimester ( Figure 105). By race/ethnicity, White, Non -Hispanics (8 2.2%) had the highest percent receiving prenatal care, followed by Asian, Non -Hispanics ( 81.1%), Hispanics/Latinos (6 5.6%), and Black, Non -Hispanic s (60.2%). In Hudson County, 73.9 % of births received prenatal care in the first trimester. Similar to statewide trends, Hispanics/Latinos (6 8.4%) and Black, Non -Hispanics (6 1.2%) in Hudson County had the lowest access to prenatal care . Additional data on access to prenatal care are presented in Figure 131 in the Appendix. Figure 105.

Similarly, in 2020, 8.3% of births in Hudson County were low birthweight births , with Black, Non -Hispanics having the highest proportion of low birthweight births (1 3.0%). In Hudson County, 1.2% of births were very low birthweight (<1,500 grams) , with Black, Non -Hispanics (3.0%) having more than double the proportion of very low birthweight births , followed by Hispanics (1.6%) (See Figure 130 Non-Hispanic Hispanic/Latino White, Non-Hispanic2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 107 Figure 106.

Thus, it is a marker of health disparities. Across the state, the maternal mortality rate was 0.5 deaths per 100,000 population from 2015 to 2019 ( Figure 108). In line with other measures of infant and maternal health, Black, Non -Hispanics had the highest maternal mo rtality rate (1.2 deaths per 100,000), more than double the state -wide rate, with other racial/ethnic groups closer to the state -wide average. Two factors may have exacerbated disparities in maternal deaths in recent years : the COVID -19 pandemic , which is associated with an increased risk of maternal morbidity and mortality, and which disproportionately affected Black residents and curtailed access to safe abortion care .

It has long -term social and economic consequences, as often, pregnant teens drop out of school, curtailing futur e opportunities for education and employment, and perpetuating the cycle of poverty. While teen pregnancy was not discussed at length during the assessment conversations, p articipants did talk about how legal challenges and restrictions to safe abortion an d post -abortion care may severely curtail teen's ability to make reproductive choices. Data from the New Jersey Birth Certificate Database show the number of teen births per 1,000 female population from 201 4 to 20 20, by race/ethnicity. At the state level, the overall teen birth rate was 10.9 per 1,000 and the highest teen birth rate was among Hispanics/Latinos ( 25.0 per 1,000), followed by Black, Non -Hispanics (1 9.7 per 1,000). In Hudson County , the overall teen birth rate was higher than the state, 17 .2 per 1, 000 ( Figure 109).

Access to healthcare services is important for promoting and maintaining health, preventing and managing disease, and reducing the chance of premature death. Access and Utilization of Preventive Services, Including Immunizations Participants in the healthcare field unanimously noted a decline in access to preventive care in Hudson County during the pandemic . Some focus group and interview participants discussed delaying care, particularly routine preventive services, in recent yea rs. Reasons cited included the high cost of care , being uninsured, not having sick leave, not having providers that spoke their language, and/or not having childcare available. On the other hand, participants indicated that having a primary care provider and/ or access to a trusted FQHC were two factors that facilitated access to care. The community survey fielded in spring/summer 2021 asked respondents about their participation in various healthcare screenings, including prev entive services , in the past two years . Approximately 77% of Hudson County survey respondents reported receiving an annual physical exam ; 73% a vision screening; 68% a dental screening ; and approximately 7 4% a flu shot in the past two years.

These patterns were confirmed by surveillance data. Among children in Hudso n County, surveillance data from 2017 -2018 indicate nearly 96% of children were fully immunized (Figure 111). However, 2019 data indicate that only 38 % of Fee- for-Service (FFS) Medicare enrollees reported having received an annual flu vaccination in Hudson County, compared to 51% in New Jersey over all (Figure 112). Further, only one in five (20.4%) of eligible Hudson County residents reported receiving a pneumonia vaccine in 2020 (Figure 113). Given the disruption of COVID -19 on access to care, current percentages may be lower. Figure 111.

High healthcare cost was the top barrier mentioned by residents , providers, and healthcare administrators . Other barriers identified through discussions were lack of insurance and/or insurance challe nges, scheduling convenience, long wait times, provider availability, stigma and discrimination, and language and cultural barriers. In addition, fear of institutions due to the increase in anti-immigrant discourse and persecution of undocumented individuals was cited as a major impediment for care access among this population. Many r esidents indicated that they only sought care from hospitals in an emergency; high and unpredictable cost of hospital care, trust, and unavailability of bilingual providers were some of the issues that made residents prefer to seek care from community -based clinics, FQHC s, or private practices . Participants also noted that d isruptions to the healthcare system due to the pandemic , e.g., temporary closures and retirement of older providers, further distanced residents from services. Barriers to healthcare access were discussed in multiple ways (e.g., survey, focus groups, interviews) and different issues emerged via the various methods. In the comm unity survey, respondents selected which barriers they ha d experienced from a list. Only 29.4 % of survey respondents indicated that they have never experienced any difficulty in getting healthcare. Overall, t he top issues selected were cost of care (32.4%) and ability to schedule an appointment at a convenient time (30.9%) (Figure 114). Differences emerged by race/ethnicity. White respondents were the most likely to report that they did not have an issue accessing care (34.9%) ; ability to schedule an appointment was marked by 53.5 % of Asian \"Preventive care is pretty much nonexistent. Most community members might not have primary care linkage, they often provide the name of a specialist when asked who their PCP is. There are a lot of gaps in terms of availability and being able to afford to see a PCP .\" - Focus group participant 24.7% 20.4% New Jersey Hudson County2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 114 respondents ; Black respondents were the most likely to note insurance problems (42.3%); and over 40% of Asian and Latino respondents marked cost of care as an issue (See Cost of Care section below) .

As described above, Latino (42.6%) and Asian (41.9%) respondents were more likely than White (23.6%) respondents to mark cost of care as a barrier (Figure 114). Many Black respondents also mentioned cost of care as a barrier (38.5%). This barrier existed for both preventive care and more complex care. Some p articipants noted that they were able to access free health screenings when offered by the city, hospitals or the FQHCs. However, others did not, and remarked on having to pay a fee for basic preventive services, including COVID -19 tests , as a disincentive . In the words of a Latina resident, \"They sent me a $400 bill for a mammogram, and I wasn't working. Later I learned that there are organizations that offer it for free.\" Even for insured individuals, the cost of medication and treatment of chronic diseas es, including diabetes and cancer, is unaffordable. Many patients are faced with the dilemma of paying for rent, food, or medicine. Cost of care is a barrier for low -income residents, overall, but an even greater barrier for undocumented residents, as they are not eligible to receive government insurance. Participants in the Latino focus groups described being particularly wary of going to the hospital because of the high cost of care and going only in emergencies. Numerous residents remarked that obtaining charity care is an onerous task and many remarked that they had been rejected . Cost of care is also a barrier for middle -low income families, as they do not qualify for Medicaid or other government programs, but t hey cannot afford to pay for the medical bills. Even veterans who are insured through the Veterans Administration complained of the hurdles of accessing care and of receiving high hospital bills if they had to seek services in a non -affiliated hospital. Health Insurance Several participants stated that lack of health insurance and insufficient coverage are barriers to accessing healthcare. Healthcare providers and administrators indicated that many patients were uninsured and had difficulty accessing care . Multiple participants noted that uninsured patients would rather seek care from private physicians , rather than the hospital, because they fear the hospital costs. As described by this resident, \"People that don't have insurance or a primary care doctor have to fin d a private physician. When I first arrived to this country and had a job that didn't offer insurance, I had to spend all day waiting to see the doctor. There were usually about 60 people waiting.\" Participants indicated that even with insurance, people f aced many challenges. As one person stated, \"The lack of accepting insurances [is a big problem] , not a lot places accept state insurance. They may not have the \"right state insurance\" according to some companies .\" Participants enrolled in Medicare were grateful to have this insurance, however, one participant mentioned the high copays and the high cost of medi cine without Part D. Census data indicate that health insurance coverage is still an issue for many Hudson County residents, although this varies by neighborhood . A higher percentage of the population in Hudson County was uninsured than in New Jersey (12.4% vs. 7.6%) (Figure 115). Only 2.7% of Hoboken residents were \"If you don't have a doctor who's caring, or for like, people who are on Medicaid and Medicare, it's difficult. Like the seniors who are on Medicare, they have to pay a copay.... If you don't have the Part D for prescriptions, you don't get a deal on the prescriptions. I think that's horrible, after working your whole life... .\" - Key informant interviewee 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 116 uninsured compared to 23.4% of Union City residents , and 14.8% of residents in Jersey City zip code 07304. More than one in ten residents are uninjured in Jersey City zip codes 07305, 07306, and 07 307. Percentage of the population with private health insurance can be found in Figure 132 in the Appendix . Figure 115. Percent Population Uninsured, by State, County, and Town, 2016 -2020 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 Children have greater access to primary care than their caregivers. Many children live in mixed immigration status households ; they qualify for free or low -cost state health insurance as U.S. citizens , but their parents do not . Children can also access primary care through school clinics . In 201 6-2020, 5.4% of children under age 19 were uninsured in Hudson County, less than half of the percentage of uninsured adults (12.4%) in the county , but higher than the state averag e (3.9 %) (Figure 116). No children were uninsured in Hoboken and Jersey City zip code 07310 according to the American Community Survey data , compared to 8.5% of children in Union City and 7.2% of children in Jers ey City zip code 07304.

As a result, patients waited months for an appointment and face d long wait times prior to the visit . Participants indicated a dearth of both primary care providers and specialists. Focus gro up participants in the healthcare field noted that it was difficult to hire and retain staff in communit y-based non-profit organizations . A major barrier w as inadequate compensation. Staff did not receive competitive salaries and benefits package s due to federal funding regulations, including salary caps , lack of sick leave, and temporary contracts . As a focus group participant described, \"We are all struggling with staff retention, providers, nurses, CMAs, everyone right now . It's almost like we can't afford them. No matter how much we pay people , they can be traveling nurses an d make way more. \" According to participants, sickness, s taff burnout , and safety concerns during the pandemic further exacerbated the situation. Another problem noted related to provider retention were the inadequate affordable childcare options for staff with children. Whereas offering appointments during work hours is a problem for clients without sick leave, it is difficult to staff the evening hours. As a focus grou p participant in the healthcare field explained, \"We couldn't extend hours with staff because they need to pick up their children. The policy of the daycare providers is if they aren't there by 6 , they call CPS. If we need to give late hours, Head Start sh ould be required to give late hours. \" Participants in the healthcare field remarked that not all communities were represented by the staff; whereas there were plenty of Indian providers who spoke multiple languages, this was not so for Spanish and other languages. As described about mental healthcare providers in the Mental Health section above , more general and specialty care providers are needed in Hudson County. Surveillance data from 2017 ind icate that Hudson County ha d fewer people per every primary care physician ( 1,950 :1) than New Jersey overall (1,190:1), indicating a smaller person to provider ratio ( Figure 117). The need is noted even more urgent ly with specialty care. For example, the ratio of persons per dentists in Hudson County was 1,590:1 in 2018, compared to 1,160 in New Jersey ( Figure 118). The pandemic has probably increased this ratio. Figure 117. Ratio of Population to Primary Care Physicians, by State and County, 2017 DATA SOURCE: American Medical Association, Area Health Resource File, as reported by County Health Rankings, University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2017 1,190 :11,950 :1 New Jersey Hudson County \"When we studied the data a few years ago, people didn't understand what we meant about the ratio of people to doctors, that was like 2400:1, there were also poor numbers for mental health , and I would guess that's gotten worse. \" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 118 Figure 118. Ratio of Population to Dentists, by State and County, 2018 DATA SOURCE: National Provider Identification file, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Area Health Resource File, as reported by County Health Rankings, University of Wisconsin Population He alth Institute, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2018 Language and Cultural Factors Related to Healthcare Access Participants in the healthcare and social service field noted using different strategies to bridge language and cultural barriers. Many sites, including the hospital and the health department, described having agreements with translation companies to provide telephonic support in any language. In addition, heal thcare partners in most settings develop and disseminate informational materials and provide signage in multiple languages. Staff at many of the healthcare sites are themselves bi - or multilingual speakers. From a cultural perspective, many of the health care institutions in the area hire local staff , wh o represent the community . This strategy goes a long way in building trust with community members and overcoming some of the wariness for hospitals . As one healthcare employee explained, \"Being born and raised here, I can say it's the diversity of who we are that makes us special. Also being residents of the area who can identify what the needs are and try to address them in our agencies as residents.\" Another strategy is finding cultural ambassadors or credible messengers that can be a go -between for the healthcare institutions and the community. In the view of some participants, this strategy is there on paper, but needs to be implemented more proactively. As explained by a parti cipant , \"For people who speak languages other than English, we need not just the commitment to having it there, but actively promoting it, so that influential voices in those communities serve as ambassadors to say, you know if you if you speak Hindi , there's somebody at the medical center for you , or if you speak Pashto .\" 1160 :11590 :1 New Jersey Hudson County \"In general , we see access problems for Latinos, partly language based, and I think I've seen it largely as reflective of the fact that any non -English outreach tends to be an afterthought and not an attempt to truly connect and promote to those communities .\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 119 Certain groups are more represented than others. Healthcare staff explained that good strides had been made in reaching the Black and the Hindi communit ies; however , reaching Latinos and other immigrants has been difficult ; further , more work is needed to increase trust in the Black community . An advocate highlighted the need for more racial equity training for healthcare providers, \"I've heard of horrific experiences because of being African American, healthcare providers don't unde rstand the pain of African American folk .\" When describing the healthcare workforce needed in Hudson County, an administrator described, \"It's not just culturally competent, it's a workforce that looks like the community and helps with institutional trust issues found in different populations but especially with low income, African American, immigrant, rural, blue collar, politically leaning communities. \" To complement this observation, several Latino residents described language as a barrier to accessing health at hospitals . One patient described this experience, \"They gave me a referral for an eye doctor, they made an appointment for a video call, but I couldn't attend the appointment because it's always only in English, nothing else . They need staff who are bilingual.\" Community -Based Organizations and Coalitions Hudson County was described as having substantial and strong social services. Community -based nonprofits were seen as mission -driven and committed to their clients. Partnerships between the community -based organizations, hospitals, schools , and the government were seen as a strength in Hudson County and critical to providing services to those in need . As described by a public health administrator, \"Overall, as a city and a group of health industry collaborators, I think the hospital, the FQHCs, and the Department of Health, we have always worked hand in hand to address the needs, we are also involved in an HIV ending committee, but also access to healthcare, specific and broad topics.\" As mentioned earlier in this report, participants also spoke about city- wide efforts such as HealthierJC , which have promoted prevention, identified and addressed public h ealth gaps, and coordinated efforts across public health, hospitals, and community -based nonprofits , as well engaged the business community. Residents and public health administrators uplifted the role of community -based nonprofits in bridging the gap to services for those most marginalized. Residents noted how staff at FQHCs went out of their way to address their physical, mental, and social needs, bein g their first stop for primary healthcare, regardless of immigration status . Many residents seek free screenings from non -profit groups serving the LGBTQ+, Asian, Latino, and African -American communities. Latino residents expressed trust in the FQHC staff and described getting support to obtain the social services they were eligible for. A community -based service administrator described their vision as an integral part of the community, \"We like that the community thinks of us as their go -to place , community health centers, sometimes generations of patients. Sometimes we see someone as a child now bringing their children to pediatrics, from birth to death.\" One limitation that participants noted about community -based groups w as their limited financial and human resources. Sustainability and dependence o n grant funding, that is, funding which is variable and \"From my experience, over 20 years, I feel that the greatest strength are the community -based organizations. We have a wide range of individuals who form different communities, even small grassroots community -based organizations, to engage people in healthy ways .\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 120 short -term , were mentioned as problems . When speaking about the importance of uplifting community - based partners, a healthc are administrat or noted, \" Most of the strengths we mentioned are double edged. There's a lot of organizations that aren't well resourced financially, they are trying to do some good work , but with no sustainable resources or capacity to expand. \" In part because of this, m ost partic ipants saw a role for a stronger coalition in Hudson County that includes well -resource d hospitals . Participants expressed that there was a lot of collaboration among government actors, hospitals, schools, and community -based organizations. They remarked that each partner complemented each other and collaborated well, as shown during the pandemic. Focus group participants indicated that there was continued room for growth in this area. Community Vision and Suggestions for the Future Focus group and interview participants were asked for their suggestions for addressing identified needs and their vision for the future. The following section summarizes and presents participants' recommendations for future consideration. Expanding and Strengthening Behavioral Health and Overall Healthcare Services Health as Human Right: \"It is urgent to have access to free, quality health care\" Almost unanimously , cost emerged as a primary barrier to health care access in qualitative discussion . Many residents indicated that healthcare should be free. Residents underscored the value of preventive care as a cost -effective intervention and urged partners to continue expandi ng access to these services. Participants also highlighted challenges with health insurance coverage. To address these barriers, residents recommended offering more free screenings , loosening the requirements to qualify for free and/or low -cost health insurance, and simplifying the charity care application . Participants also suggested making more efforts to \"meet people where they are ,\" through mobile clinics and education sessions based in different neighborhoods. Participants highlighted the c ommunity school model, entailing private -public partnerships between the education and healthcare sectors , and the community , as a promising initiative to promote the well -being of low-income families. Greater Accessibility and Availability of Behavioral Health Services Participants remarked on the difficulties faced by all groups, particularly Black, LGBTQ+, veterans, and young residents, to accessing quality, culturally competent mental health care . Participants highlighted the need for more mental health workers . Focus group participants and interviewees hoped to see more community -based ment al health services, including recovery programs that are affordable and accept all insurance types. They also advocated for more prevention education programs to address problem substance use in the community, especially among youth and veterans . Participants suggested providing more education to address the stigma that surrounds mental health among many cultural groups . The need for more language capacity within the behavioral health services field was also discussed , as well as training in caring for patients of different backgrounds, including LGBTQ + patients , and those who have experienced trauma , such as veterans . \"There is also a deficit related to location, both Newark and NYC have better developed social infrastructure, especially in nonprofit, philanthropic, and people -powered engagement. It's a challenge I've seen linked to our location .\" - Focus group participa nt 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 121 Sexual and Reproductive Health and Women's Health Focus group members and interviewees were concerned about the increase in sexually transmitted infections among some groups, including cisgender women and men -who -have -sex-with -men, and about the repercussions of the rollback in constitutional protections to reproductive choice. Several participants warned that access to sexual and reproductive health services could be curtailed, even if New Jersey has progressive reproductive health policies . They noted that this would unduly affect low- income women and communities of color , thus, exacerbating existing racial/ethnic and social i nequities in maternal and infant health. Some p articipants recommended being vigilant a bout reproductive health and rights protections to support the sexual and reproductive rights of all people in New Jersey. They also underscored the importance of offering comprehensive sexuality education in schools. Focusing on the Upstream Factors and the Social Determinants of Health Inequality Growing inequality emerged as an issue of concern among most focus groups an d interview participants . Residents noticed this in neighborhood -level differences in school resources, in safety, in employment opportunities, and in the built environment. Participants attributed growing inequality on policies that cater to residents in the highest social strata and expressed frustration at this 'tale of two cities .' Residents suggested that more progressive polices on taxation, employment, education budgets , and healthcare were needed to reverse this trend. Economic and Employment Opportunities Expanding economic opportunities, especially for low -income workers, Latino residents, veterans, LGBTQ + residents, particularly trans gender people , and violence survivors was suggested as a priority area by many assessment participants. Participants recommended improving initiatives to help those who face barriers to employment obtain jobs. Suggestions included incorporating more vocational training programs in high schools to facilitate transition into the workforce , and education and incentives for employers hiring veterans and trans gender and other LGBTQ + people. Additional proposals included supporting small business owners and providing expanded workforce protections (e.g., sick leave, improved wages , childcare ) for all workers, particularly those in healthcare . Built Environment Several issues emerged as concerns in the built envi ronment. One was overdevelopment leading to overpopulation and loss of green areas; the other was the focus on building luxury rentals, resulting in gentrification. Participants enjoyed Hudson County's varied public transportation options , its walkability , and its parks . They praised current community efforts to extend green areas supportive of healthy lifestyles. Residents also highlighted the need for redevelopment and urban planning in flood -prone area s to mitigate water damage as an important emergency preparedness strategy. \"My biggest wish for this community is that we don't have such an economically diverse community. If there's a way to really help the families with the lowest economic resources to really have more financial stability , that would be ideal .\" - Key informant interviewee 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 122 Housing Access to affordable housing in safe neighborhoods was among the most discussed issues in qualitative discussions. Residents expressed concern about inflation and high taxes, coupled with the lingering economic impact of the pandemic on housing affordability, impending evictions, and homelessness, and looked for initiatives to mitigate these challenges and the high cost of housing. Participants proposed earmark ing more affordable hous ing units in the new developments, including housing for veterans ; implement ing the existing rent control policies, which also apply to foreign -born residents regardless of immigration status ; and fomenting first-time buyers' subsidies as a promising initiative to address intergenerational poverty. Greater Engagement and Access to Existing Initiatives Access to Services and Community Outreach Interviewees and focus group participants observed that information about existing services and programs were not readily accessible to community members. They recommended more be done to raise awareness about existing programs . Participants suggested organizing more education and awareness building effort s both in person and virtually in different neighborhoods and in diffe rent languages on topics that most affect the community, including on managing diabetes and high blood pressure, and on recognizing the signs of stroke. Other suggestions to bridge access to health and social services included deploying mobile vans to othe r areas in the county ; expanding health clinics that offer care for free and/or at low-cost to both children and families, particularly local and school -based clinics ; and offering appointments outside of the regular workday . Some participants recommended developing a centralized list of health and social service programs and resources , similar to the mental health directory prepared by the Health Department (https://healthierjc.com/mental -health/ ), but for other conditions. Partnerships, Community Engagement, and Community Building Participants valued the robust partnerships established among multiple organizations and across sectors, including grassroots or ganizations, government, small businesses, social services agencies, and FQHCs , as exemplified by the Partnership for a HealthierJC . Participants suggested continu ing to deepen engagement and collaboration with trusted community -based organizations , such as those representing Asian, Latino , and LGBTQ+ residents, as partners in outreach and information sharing about community service s and programs. Several participant s stressed the importance of engaging faith -based organizations , especially given their reach and level of trust in the community. Other participants discussed the need to collaborate and hire credible messengers - respected community members - to build bri dges with the community. Participants underscored mor e community outreach, a strong plan to reengage the community , and invest ing in the community as strategic areas moving forward . \"Do more preventive family care, I think it would be very profitable for the state really because it's cheaper to prevent than to deal with .\" - Key informant interviewee 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 123 Key Themes and Conclusions Through a review of the secondary social, economic, and epidemiological data; a community survey; and discussions with community residents and stakeholders, this assessment report examines the current health status of Hudson County during an unprecedented time given economic volatility, the COVID -19 pandemic , and the national movement for racial justice . Several overarching themes emerged from this synthesis: Some residents are struggling with lack of employment and economic opportunities. In 2016 -2020 , unemployment rates across Hudson County ranged from 2.4 % in Jersey City zip code 07302 to 7.0% in Jersey City zip code 07305 and 9.2% in Jersey City zip code 07304 . The u nemployment rates map ped onto racial/ethnic groups; residents in zip code 07302 are predominantly White (40.1%) and Asian (32.2%), whereas over two -thirds of residents in zip codes 07304 and 07305 are Black and Latinos . More resources for career transitions and job training and technology were identified as critical to addressin g these disparities . Focus group participants highlighted the need for more support and employer incentives for veterans and LGBTQ + residents fac ing employment discrimination. Housing affordability is a main concern in Hudson County . Housing affordability was identified as a pressing concern, particularly for persons of color , veteran s, LGBTQ + persons, immigrants, and low - income residents. Participants expressed that too many luxury rentals were being built, instead of affordable housi ng for families. There are m any renters across the area . In New Jersey, 64.0% of housing units were owner occupied in 2016 -2020, in contrast to 32.4% in Hudson County . Home ownership ranged from 12.5% in Jersey City zip code 07310 to 40.6% in Bayonne. Disparities in housing cost burden exist within Hudson County. In Jersey City zip codes 07302 and in Hoboken, less than one in three owner -occupied and 44% of renter -occupied households reported high housing costs whereas 64.4% of owner -occupied and 66.5% of renter -occupied residences in Union City reported spending more than 25% of their income on housing costs. Qualitative discussions highlighted how veterans in Hudson County tend to work in low -wage jobs and often live in multigenerational housing. Housi ng availability was also cited by interviewees as an important barrier to break ing the cycle of violence. Relocation is one of the strategies used to prevent revictimization of community and domestic violence survivors. However, according to violence inter rupters, affordable housing options in low -crime neighborhoods are limited. Several focus group and interview participants mentioned the problem of homelessness in Hudson County communities and indicated that the shelters and temporary housing available we re insufficient to meet the need . Solutions proposed included earmarking more affordable housing units in the new developments ; extending first-time buyers' subsidies , particularly for persons of color; and renovating and repurposing abandoned homes for low-income families . Mental health was identified as a significant community health concern. Mental health was identified as a top community health concern, closely associated with economic instability and chronic conditions . Black residents faced a disproportionate mental health burden. The rate of mental health hospitalizations in 2020 was 70% higher among adult Black residents (107.1 per 100,000) than the Hudson County average (63.1 per 100,000) . Black children had 38% higher hospitalized rates for mental health conditions than the county rate (34.7 per 100,000 vs. 25.2 per 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 124 100,000 ). Residents mentioned stigma and low number s of culturally competent providers as the principal barriers to mental health care access . Residents viewed chronic conditions as prevalent and linked to the s ocial determinants of health . Diabetes and high blood pressure were discussed as prevalent in the community, especially among low-income residents and communities of color, and survey respondents indicated \"overweight/obesity\" was the second most common health issue in their community. However, focus group participants focused on the barriers to healthy living including affording hea lthy food s, cost medication , and having time to exercise and be outside. Educational opportunities were seen as an important driving factor for future success. A positive and supportive school environment is important to physical and mental wellbeing, as well as to future educational and professional opportunities . Health supports academic success. Schools play an important role in facilitating access to care and helping students stay healthy , and Hudson County public schools engage with communities in multiple ways to support students. However, some schools face challenges due to in sufficient resources. Inequities in school performance are confirmed by graduation rate data from different Hudson County districts. Whereas the high school graduation rate in the Hoboken Public School District was 93.6% in 2020 -2021, the public school districts of Bayonne, Union City, and Jersey City had lower graduation rates. There were significant disparities by race/ethnicity withi n districts; 95.3% of Asian students graduated from high school in Bayonne in 2020 -2021, compared to 86.4% of Black children, and 78.5% of Latino children. Partnership based p rograms such as the community schools and The Tiger's Den at Snyder High School are a promising strategy to equalize outcomes among diverse students. Hudson County has a wealth of social service organizations and health care services, including those providing preventive care, though many residents experience barriers to accessing the se resources. Residents remarked that having a primary care doctor and being linked to a FQHC as facilitating factors to accessing care. They also discussed the importance of culturally competent providers , including providers who spoke their language and looked like them . Veterans and those working with violence survivors highlighted that having peers and mentors who could provide trauma informed care helped to be engaged in care . The high healthcare cost was the top barrier mentioned by residents, providers, and healthcare administrators . Participants in the healthcare field unanimously noted a decline in access to preventive care and mentioned this as a priority strategic area . They uplifted partnerships and community engagem ent as ways to bridge the care gap. Prioritization Process and Priorities Selected for Planning Prioritization allows hospitals, organizations, and coalitions to target and align resources, leverage efforts, and focus on achievable goals and strategies for addressing community needs. Priorities for this process were identified by examining data and themes from the CHNA findings utilizing a systematic, engaged approach. This section describes the process and outcomes of the prioritization proce ss. Criteria for Prioritization A set of criteria were used to determine the priority issues for action. The RWJBH Systemwide CHNA Steering Committee put forth the following criteria to guide prioritization processes across the RWJBH system. 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 125 Prioritizat ion Criteria Burden : How much does this issue affect health in the community? Equity : Will addressing this issue substantially benefit those most in need? Impact : Can working on this issue achieve both short -term and long -term changes? Is there an opportunity to enhance access/accessibility? Systems Change : Is there an opportunity to focus on/implement strategies that address policy, systems, and environmental change? Feasibility : Can we take steps to address this issue, given the current infrastru cture, capacity, and political will? Collaboration/Critical Mass : Are existing groups across sectors already working on or willing to work on this issue together? Significance to Community : Was this issue identified as a top need by a significant number of community members? Prioritization Process The prioritization process was multifaceted and aimed to be inclusive, participatory, and data -driven. Step 1: Input from Community Members and Stakeholders via Primary Data Collection During each step of the p rimary data collection phase of the CHNA, assessment participants were asked for input. Key informant interviewees and focus group participants were asked about the most pressing concerns in their communities and the three highest priority issues for futur e action and investment (see Key Informant Interview and Focus Group Guides in the Appendices). Community survey respondents were also asked to select up to four of the most important issues for future action in their communities, noted in the Community He alth Issues section of the CHNA Report. Based on responses gathered from key informant interviews, focus group participants, and community survey respondents, as well as social, economic, and health data from surveillance systems, ten initial issue areas were identified for Hudson County (listed below in no particular order) : Financial Insecurity Unemployment Food Insecurity Housing Chronic Diseases (e.g., heart disease, cancer, diabetes) Infectious Diseases, including COVID -19 Violence Prevention & Safety Mental Health Substance Use Access to Preventive Care Step 2: Data -Informed Voting via a Prioritization Meeting On October 2 7, 2022, a 90 -minute virtual community meeting was held with the RWJBH Jersey City/Hudson County CHNA Advisory Committee (see Appendix A for members), so Advisory Committee members could discuss and vote on preliminary priorities for action. During the virt ual prioritization meeting on Zoom, attendees heard a brief data presentation on the key findings from the CHNAs conducted across Hudson County. 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 126 Next, meeting participants were divided into small groups to reflect on and discuss the data and offer their perspectives and feedback on the various issues. Meeting participants then shared information from their discussions with the full group. At the end of the meeting, using Zoom's polling tool, participants were asked to vote for up to four of the ten prio rities identified from the data and based on the specific prioritization criteria (Burden, Equity, Impact, Systems Change, Feasibility, Collaboration/Critical Mass, and Significance to Community). A total of thirty -two Advisory Committee members voted duri ng the Community Prioritization Meeting. In addition, polling remained open for an additional week to gather responses from those who were not able to attend the meeting. An additional six responses were received during this period. Voting ranked the following issues as top priorities, with mental health receiving the highest percentage of responses. Percentage Vote #s Mental Health 74% 28/38 Housing 19/38 Violence Prevention & Safety 42% 16/38 Access to Preventive 5% 2/38 After a prioritization process with the Advisory Committee and discussions within the hospital taking into consideration existing expertise, capacity, and experience, JCMC will focus on Access to Preventive Care; Chronic Disease Management, including Behav ioral Health Services; Food Insecurity and Education; and Violence Prevention and Safety as priorities during the development of its implementation plan in 2023. JCMC will tackle these priority action areas as part of ongoing community engagement efforts a nd with an overarching emphasis on addressing systemic racism, racial injustice, and discrimination .2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 127 APPENDICES Appendix A - RWJBH Jersey City/Hudson County CHNA Advisory Committee Members Deborah Almonte, Jersey City Medical Center Jenny Andrews, Jersey City Medical Center Maureen Archibald, Jersey City Medical Center Tara Artesi, Legal Assistance to Medical Patients (LAMP) Project Adrienne Austin, Jersey City Medical Center Pamela Baker, Collaborative Support Programs (CSPNJ) Rakel Barri entos, Jersey City Medical Center Patrick Beaty, MD, Metropolitan Family Health Network Paul Bellan -Boyer , Jersey City Department of Health and Human Services Christina Bishop -Feeny, Jersey City Medical Center Sheridan Blackwell, Jersey City Medical Cente r Kimberly Blackwell, Jersey City Medical Center Whitney Bracco, Jersey City Medical Center Jenna Camacho, Jersey City Medical Center Scott Carey, Metropolitan Family Health Network Kristin Carlino, Jersey City Medical Center Kristy Case, Jersey City Med ical Center Suzanne Cavanaugh, City of Bayonne Ritu Chandak, Jersey City Medical Center Jamie Chebra, Jersey City Medical Center Jessica Chung, Jersey City Medical Center Timothy Daniels, Jersey City Medical Center Christine Dimaculangan, Jersey City Medical Center Cheryl Dorn, Peace Care Joan Dublin, Metropolitan Family Health Network Mark Duda, Visiting Nurse Association Health Group Leah Dungee, Jersey City Medical Cen ter Joan Eccleston , Jersey City Department of Health and Human Services Edoardo Ferrante, City of Bayonne Marissa Fisher, Jersey City Medical Center Stacey Flanagan, Jersey City Department of Health and Human Services Juliet Foster , Division of Veterans A ffairs, Jersey City Department of Health and Human Services Katherine Fromm, Jersey City Medical Center Marli Gelfand, Jersey City Medical Center Silvana Gomez, Jersey City Medical Center Stephanie Gonzalez , Jersey City Medical Center William Gonzalez, Jersey City Medical Center Kwaku Gyekye, Jersey City Medical Center Tina Harvey, Jersey City Medical Center Victoria Hayes, York Street Project 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 128 Angelo Hunt, St. Lucy's Shelter Linda Ivory -Green , Jersey City De partment of Health and Human Services Maryanne Kelleher , Jersey City Department of Health and Human Services Surendra Khera, MD, Jersey City Medical Center Kenneth King, Jersey City Medical Center Rita Knause, MD, North Hudson Community Action Corporation Jordan Kowalczewski, Barnabas Health Medical Group Theresa Laflam, Jersey City Medical Center Mabel Laforgia, Jersey City Medical Center Judy Lagani, Lincoln High School and Dickinson High School Maria Veronica Lavarro, Jersey City Medical C enter Michael Loftus, Jersey City Medical Center Mike McLean , Jersey City Department of Health and Human Services Janet Merly -Liranzo, Peace Care St. Ann's Susan Milan, Garden State Episcopal Community Development Corporation Stephanie Mills, Hudson Pride Stacie Newton, Jersey City Medical Center Tri Nguyen, Jersey City Medical Center Michele O'Reilly, City of Bayonne - Health Division Maria Otadoy, Jersey City Medical Center Lashawn Overton, Jersey City Medical Center Grace Palmer, Jersey City Medical Center Alicia Parker, Hyacinth AIDS Foundation Leo Pellegrini, Health & Human Services of Hoboken Joan Quigley, North Hudson Community Action Corporation Tara Reid, Jersey City Medical Center Jeffery Rodriguez, Jersey City Medical Center Elizabeth Schedl, Hudson Pride Aniello Semioli, Jersey City Medical Center Jessica Semioli, Jersey City Medical Center Thomas Sheehy, Peace Care St. Joseph's Tina Siciliano, Jotham W.

The purpose o f the CHNA was to identify and analyze community health needs and assets and prioritize those needs to inform strategies to improve community health. This assessment focused on the following Hudson Coun ty areas: Bayonne, 07310), and Union City . Context This CHNA was conducted during an unprecedented period due to the COVID -19 pandemic and the national movement for racial justice. The COVID -19 pandemic impacted both the CHNA data collection process, as well as topics and concerns that residents raised in focus groups and key informant interviews. A wave of national protests for racial equity in 2020 highlighted how racism is embedded in systems across the US. The national movement informed the content of this report including the data collection processes, design of data collection instruments, and the input that was shared during focus groups, key informant interviews, and through surve y responses. Methods While this CHNA aimed to be comprehensive, its data collection approach focused on the social and economic upstream issues that affect a community's health. Data collection was conducted using a social determinants of health framework and a health equity lens. The CHNA process ut ilized a mixed - methods, participatory approach that engaged agencies, organizations, and community residents through different avenues. The CHNA process was guided by the strategic leadership of the RWJBH Syste mwide CHNA Steering Committee, the JCMC Commun ity Outreach & Social Impact Steering Committee , the JCMC/Hudson County CHNA Advisory Committee, and the community overall. Data collection m ethods included: Reviewing existing social, economic, and health data in the JCMC primary and secondary service areas in Hudson County . Conducting a community survey with 273 residents designed and administered by Bruno & Ridgway. Facilitating 6 virtual focus groups with 1 05 participants from populations of interest, includ ing veterans, and residents who identified as Black , Asian, and Latino, the latter held in Spanish . Conducting 7 key informant interviews with 12 community stakeholders from a range of sectors. Facilitating a guided discussion with the JCMC Community Outre ach & Social Impact Steering Committee. Jersey City Medical Center /Hudson County CHNA Focus Area 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment ii Findings The following provides a brief overview of the key findings that emerged from this assessment: Population Characteristics Demographics.

Median household income in Hudson County showed stark disparities , ranging from $49,457 in Union City, with a majority Latino population , to $153,438 in Hoboken, a predominantly White area.7 In 2019, 29.8% of Black children and 23.4% of Latino children lived in poverty , compared to 9.8% in the county overall .8 Among veterans, 7.5% lived below the poverty line in the county overall , with 21.4% doing so in Jersey City zip code 07306 .9 Focus group participants shared the day -to-day challenges of affording housing , food, and healthcare as prices continue to climb across the board. While the rising cost of living affects everyone, participants shared that it has been most painful for low -wage workers and those on fixed incomes, such as seniors. Food Access and Food Security. Participants mentioned that many families with children - often immig rants -, older adults , and those who were housing insecure were struggling to put food, particularly healthy food, on the table. Residents reported that food insecurity increased during the COVID -19 pan demic, despite stepping up food distribution efforts. Around one in four survey respondents overall, and about one in three Latino respondents, indicated that they relied on food pantries or other food assistance programs.10 Housing. Participants reported that affordable housing in their communities was sparse and difficult to obtain. Residents discussed the challenges of qualifying for affordable housing, rising rents due to an influx of New York ers, increasing socioeconomic segregation , and homelessness. More than half of renter -occupied households in Hudson County spend 25% or more of their monthly inc ome on housing costs , ranging from 39. 0% in Jersey City zip code 07302 to 66.5% in Union City and 64.6% in Jersey City zip code 07305 .11 6 U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 7 U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 8 U.S. Census Bureau, Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates, as reported by County Health Rankings, University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2019 9 U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 10 DATA SOURCE: Community Health Needs Assessment S urvey Data, Brun o & Ridgway, 2021 11 U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 Percent Population Food Insecure, by State 8.6%11.1% 12.0%15.5% New Jersey Hudson County2019 2020 Feeding America, Map the Mea l Gap 2021 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment iv Transportation. Participants valued the ample availability of public t rans portation options in Hudson County. Most par ticipants indicate d that they were not car dependent and noted that it was easy to get around. In addition, participants indicated that the partnership s between health care facilities and private transportation c ompanies facilitated access to health care for older adults , persons with disabilities, and violence survivors. Green Space and Built Environment. Multiple residents expressed their concerns that there were too many new constructions , result ing in overpo pulation and a shrinkage of green space. Participants highlighted the importance of emergency preparedness for flood ing and mentioned that mitigating redevelopment projects were underway. Residents also noted the contribution of grassroots organi zations to public park maintenance , also important for increased water absorption. About 70% of Hudson County survey respondents agreed or completely agreed with the statement, \"My community has safe outdoor places to walk and play.\"12 Violence Prevention and Safety . Similar to the 2019 CHNA, for many, violence prevention and safety con tinue to be priority issues for many residents. Participants shared differing views about safety and violence. Many indicated being safe in their neighborhoods, while others reported b eing nervous about crime . In 2020, Jersey City (432 per 100,000 resident s) had more than double the violent crime rate (i.e., murder, rape, aggravated assault) than the state average (195 per 100,000 residents).13 Black residents indicated that they experie nced a disproportionate burden of violence, including gun violence, and trauma, with Black survey respondents' marking violence/community safety as the top health priority.14 Key informant interviewees indicated that Jersey City has robust programs and reso urces to address and mitigate the impact of violence and trauma , including the Anti-Violence Coalition and Project H.U.D.S.O.N . According to interviewees, promising results to interrupt the cycle of violence have been achieved by reaching survivors soon af ter injury and providing trauma -informed intensive case management and wraparound services, including safe housing and vocational training, in addition to medical care and counseling. Systemic Racism and Discrimination. With few exceptions, participants spoke of pervasive inequities experienced by people of different groups. Residents discussed the multiplying effect of historical and current discriminatory practices due to multiple conditions, such as race/ethnicity, gender, immigrant status, and socioe conomic status, among others. Participants noted these issues largely impacted communities of color because of the policies and practices embedded throughout society. Residents mentioned that some Hudson County municipalities have put in place programs to address the effects of systemic racism, such as first -time homeowner programs for low -income residents, rent control policies, and programs to promote minority and/or wom en owned business. However, participants emphasized that more are needed. 12 Community Health Needs Assessment Survey Data, Bruno & Ridgway, 2021 13 State of New Jersey, Department of Law and Public Safety, Uniform Crime Reporting Unit, 2019 14 Community Health Needs Assessment Survey Data, Bruno & Ridgway, 2021 \"The undocumented are scared to ask for help, and we are seeing that community getting jumped overnight, not wanting to go to the hospital over what they will get charged. \"- Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment v Community He alth Issues Perceptions of Community Health. Focus group participants and interviewees identified social and economic issues such as financial insecurity, housing, and transportation as top community concerns, noting that these issues affect ot her aspects of health. Participants also discussed challenges in accessing care, the increase in mental health concerns, and the lingering effects of the COVID -19 pandemic. Community survey respondents ranked mental health, overweight/obesity, high stress lifestyle, affordable housing , and affordable eldercare as the top five health concerns in the community . Leading Causes of Death and Premature Mortality. Heart disease, COVID -19, and cancer were the top three leading causes of death in Hudson County in 2020. In 2018 -2020, Black residents experienced higher rates of premature mortality (deaths before age 75) than any other racial/ethnic groups.15 Obesity, Healthy Eating, and Physical Activity. While overweight/obesity was identified as the second top health concern ( after mental health) by community survey respondents,16 it was not a prominent theme in conversations with residents . Participants mentioned di sparities in the availability and affordability of healthy foods by neighborhood, with some areas considered food deserts. Some residents indicated enjoying the area's walkability , while others noted safety issues , sidewalks in disrepair , and time constraints as barriers to physical activity . Chronic Diseases . Like findings from the 2019 CHNA , chronic diseases cont inue to be a top community concern. Data show racial/ethnic disparities in chronic disease burden across Hudson County. Black residents experienced higher cardiovascular disease mortality rates than other racial/ethnic groups in the county. Diabetes was a top priority concern and participant s indicated that it was highly prevalent in their communities. The cancer mortality rate in Hudson County was highest among Black (182.9 per 100,000) , followed by White (148.5 per 100,000) , residents.17 In terms of chroni c disease screenings, 70% of community survey respondents indicated that they had participated in a cholesterol screening, and nearly 8 7% had participated in a blood pressure screening in the past two years.18 Many participants mentioned health care costs a s a barrier to chronic disease management. Disability. While the issue of disabilities did not emerge often in the qualitative discussions , many people with disabilities face economic instability as they rel y on government financial assistance programs fo r their basic needs. A key informant interviewee highlighted the importance of early intervention to address the needs of children with disabilities.

Echoing the 2019 CHNA, m ental health disorders were the top health priority selected by survey respondents and a prominent theme in inter views and focus groups. Job loss and economic pressures and the uncertainty associated with the pandemic were cited as contributors to increased stress and depression by Hudson County residents , including among veterans and members of the LGBTQ+ community . Participants indicated stigma , long wait times for appointments, and unavailability of multilingual mental health care providers as barriers to accessing care. Several participants identified substance misuse , relapse, and overdose deaths among young people as a further health c oncern in the aftermath of COVID -19, with the drug poisoning rate increasing from 2016 to 2020.20 Environmental Health. The rate of age -adjusted ED visits for asthma declined in Hudson County from 2018 -2020.21 It should be noted that this decline may be due to individuals with asthma being reluctant to seek care during the height of the COVID -19 pandemic. The proportion of children born in 2014 who were tested for lead exposure before 36 months of age is higher in Hudson Count y (77.6%) than in the state (74.4%).22 Communicable Disease s. Conversations related to COVID -19 primarily focused on how the pandemic exacerbated existing social and economic inequities . Several participa nts were concerned by the increasing rates of sexually transmitted infections, incl uding HIV and chlamydia , among women of color and the LGBTQ+ population . The rate of HIV transmission f or Black New Jersey residents was 30.2 per 100,000 persons, ten times higher than among White residents (3.1 per 100,000). Nearly 3,000 per 100,000 women aged 15-24 contract 19 U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 20 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, U nderlying Cause of Death 1999 -2020 on CDC WONDER Online Database, 2016 and 2020 21 New Jersey Discharge Data Collection System, Office of Health Care Quality Assessment, New Jersey Department of Health, New Jersey State Health Assessment Data (NJSHAD), 2018 and 2020 22 New Jersey Birth Certificate Database, Office of Vital Statistics and Registry; Child Health Program, Family Health Services, as reported by, New Jersey Department of Health, New Jersey State Health Assessment Data (NJSHAD), 2022 Population to Mental Health Provider Ratios , by State and County, 2019 450:11570 :1 New Jersey Hudson County DATA SOURCE: National Provider Identification Registry, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \"[COVID impacted] housing, food insecurity, jobs, people have a fear of going back to work, and childcare, because there was a time when everything was virtual, how can parents afford to stay home and put food on the table ?\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment vii chlamydia annually in Hudson County.23 Participants also expressed concerns about the roll -back of reproductive rights and the negative impact that would have on women's health, noting the inequitable burden on low -income women. Matern al and Infant Health. Maternal and infant health indicators are markers of inequity as most maternal and perinatal health complications are preventable with access to quality, adequate , timely care and information, including comprehensive sexual ity educati on. In Hudson County, a lower percentage of Black and Latino residents sought prenatal care in the first trimester compared to Asian and White residents. The rates of low birth weight and preterm births among infants born to Black residents roughly double d those of White residents ,24 indicating health care access barriers. Access to Services Access to Preventive Services. Participants reported that access to routine screenings and preventive care declined since the onset of the COVID -19 pandemic , despite the efforts of many partners. Participants indicated that having a primary care provider and/or access to a trusted FQHC facilitated access to care. Approximately 77% of community survey respondents reported having an annual physical exam and 74% a flu shot in the last two years.25 Access to Primary C are Services. Cost, workforce cap acity, insurance, and language and cultural factors were most often mentioned by focus group and interview participants as barriers to accessing primary care. Community survey res pondents indicated ability to schedule an appointment at a convenient time, i nsurance problems, cost of care, and wait times as the main barriers to care.26 About 30% of respondents indicated never experiencing barriers. Within the JCMC service area, the pr oportion of uninsured residents was highest in Union City (23.4%) and lowest in Hoboken (2.7%) .27 Some p articipants, particularly veterans, mentioned experiencing disruptions in access to mental health services during the pandemic , including to support grou ps and counseling, leading to treatment setbacks and substance use relapse . Community -Based Organizations and Coalitions . Partnerships between the community -based organizations, hospitals, schools , and the government were seen as a strength in Hudson Cou nty and critical to providing services to those in need. City-wide efforts suc h as HealthierJC have been important to coordinate efforts across multiple partners, including the business community. Residents and public health administrators uplifted the rol e of community -based nonprofits in bridging the gap to services for those most marginalized. Most participants saw a promising role for a strong and broad coalition in Hudson County. 23 Communicable Disease Reporting and Surveillance System, New Jersey Department of Health, as reported by the New Jersey State Health Assessment Data (NJSHAD), 2020 & 2021 24 New Jersey Birth Certificate Database, Office of Vital Statistics and Registry, New Jersey Depar tment of Health, New Jersey State Health Assessment Data (NJSHAD), 2015 -2019 25 Community Health Needs Assessment Survey Data, Bruno & Ridgway, 2021 26 Community Health Needs Assessment Survey Data, Bruno & Ridgway, 2021 27 U.S. Census Bureau, American Commun ity Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 \"We have great partners. Hudson County is very tight, so we all work together - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment viii Community Vision and Suggestions for the Future Health as Human Right: \"It is urgent to have access to free, quali ty health care .\" To overcome cost barriers, p articipants recommended expanding access to free or low-cost preventive care ; loosening the requirements to qualify for free and/or low -cost health insurance ; and simpl ifying the charity care application , including for those who are foreign -born . They also suggested \"meeting people where they are\" by using mobile and school -based clinics , organizing education sessions in all neighborhoods , and offering appointm ents outsi de of the regular workday . Participants highlighted the community school model as a promising initiative to promote the well -being of low -income families . Improving Access to Services and Community Outreach . Echoing 2019 CHNA priorities, many community pa rticipants emphasized improving access to primary care as a priority for the coming years . Numerous interviewees and focus group participants noted the need for better communication about existing programs and service s. Participants suggested organizing informational sessions in different neighborhoods and languages on topics that affect the community, such as chronic disease management , and developing a centralized list of programs and resources, similar to the mental health directory prepared by the Healt h Department (https://healthierjc.com/mental -health/ ), but for other conditions. Greater Accessibility and Availability of Behavioral Health Services . Participants suggested that expanding culturally -competent trauma -informed mental hea lth care , particularly for Black, LGBTQ+, veterans, violence survivors, and young residents, should be a priority in the coming years . They recommended diversifying the mental health work force , expanding community -based affordable mental health services, increasing long -term treatment and maintenance options for persons with substance use disorders, and developing additional prevention education programs to destigmatize mental health disorders among many cultural groups. Sexual and Reproductive Health an d Women's Health . Participants underscored the importance of offering comprehensive sexuality education in schools to reduce sexually transmitted infections and reduce unplanned pregnancies among teens ; increasing access to information and reproductive health commodities to address the rise in sexually transmitted infections among cisgender women and men -who -have -sex-with -men ; and mitigating the repercussions of the rollback in constitutional protections to reproductive ch oice that could u nduly affect low -income women and communities of color, thus, exacerbating existing racial/ethnic and social inequities in maternal and infant health. Reducing Inequity and Focusing on the Social Determinants of Health. For several interv iewees and focus group members, a vision of the future included steps to reduce inequ ity and address the social determinants of health. o Expanding E mployment Opportunities: Recommendations to improve econom ic and employment opportunities included: 1) incor porating more vocational training programs in high schools to facilitate transition into the workforce ; 2) incentivizing employers to hire veterans and \"My biggest wish for this community is that we don't have such a n economically diver se community. If there's a way to really help the families with the lowest economic resources to really have more financial stability, that would be ideal .\" - Key informant interviewee 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment ix transgender and other LGBTQ+ people ; 3) providing expa nded workforce protections (e.g., sick leave, impr oved wages, childcare) for all workers, including those who are foreign -born; and 4) supporting small business owners. o Addressing the Housing Deficit : Recommendations related to expanding access to housing and addressing homelessness included: 1) earmark ing more affordable hou sing units in the new developments, including housing for veterans; 2) implementing the existing rent control policies, which also apply to foreign -born residents regardless of immigration status; 3) renovating abandoned buildings for low -income families ; 4) increasing the availability of safe temporary shelters for unhoused individuals, including for domestic and community violence survivors; and 5) fomenting first -time buyers' subsidies as a promising initiative to address interg enerational poverty . Partnerships, Community Engagement, and Community Building . Participants valued the robust partnerships established among multiple organizations and across sectors and suggested deepen ing engagement with trusted community -based organi zations, such as those representing Asian, Latino, and LGBTQ+ residents, as partners in outreach and information sharing about community services and programs. Participants underscored more community outreach, a strong plan to reengage the community, and i nvesting in the community as strategic areas moving forward. Key Themes Several overarching themes emerged from the Jersey City Medical Center /Hudson County 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment. Importantly, s everal key areas, including increasing access t o care, the importance of preventive care , and safety and violence prevention echoed those priorities identified by the community in 2019 as part of the prior CHNA process, and provide an opportunity to continue building upon those efforts. The Hudson Co unty communities that JCMC serves are diverse and health disparities exist. There is great variation in terms of demographic composition, income levels, and health status in Hudson County , with over 40% of residents not English proficient . Secondary data s how disparities in healthcare access and health outcomes based on race/ethnicity. A larger proportion of Asian and Latino community survey respondents reported feeling discriminated against when receiving c are. Secondary data show that Black residents expe rience higher rates of premature, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality, and diabetes compared to residents of other racial/ethnic groups. Residents viewed chronic conditions as prevalent and linked to the social determinants of health . Diabetes and high b lood pressure were discussed as prevalent in the community, especially among low-income residents and communities of color, and survey respondents indicated \"overweight/obesity\" was the second most common h ealth issue in their community. However, focus gro up participants focused on the barriers to healthy living faced by residents, including affording healthy foods, cost of medication, and having time to exercise and to spend outdoors . \"Prices have been slowly rising, amazing that t hey have money to build these new buildings but can't help people maintain the property they have here ....\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment x Housing, food insecur ity, and employment opportunities are top communit y concerns. Participants identified lack of quality affordable housing as a key gap in the area . Food insecurity was another area of concern , with almost half of Latino survey respondents worrying about running out of money to purchase food. Housing and fo od are related to income . Over 10% of Hudson residents reported being unemployed during the pandemic, with large variation by neighborhood. Overall, participants recommended the adoption of more policies to promote equity and support the well - being of low-income residents . Mental health was identified as a significant community health concern. Mental health was identified as a top community health concern, closely associated with racial/ethnic disparities, economic instability, and chronic conditions. Blac k residents faced a disproportionate mental health burden. The rate of mental health hospitalizations in 2020 was 70% higher among adult Black residents (107.1 per 100,000) than the Hudson County average (63.1 per 100,000). Black children had 38% higher ho spitaliz ation rates for mental health conditions than the county rate (34.7 per 100,000 vs. 25.2 per 100,000). Veterans and LGBTQ+ advocates also highlighted the mental health needs of their communities. Residents mentioned stigma and insufficient cultural ly competent providers as the principal barriers to mental health care access and emphasized the need to engage in more education efforts . Violence as an important health concer n. Violence and safety were raised as community concer ns. Some participants indicated that their neighborhoods were safe; however only 40% of survey respondents agreed that violence was not prevalent in their communities.28 Further, violence and safety w ere mentioned as the top health concern by Black survey respondents. Participants suggested continuing to strengthen efforts to end the cycle of violence by addressing its social determinants of health, through support of programs such as the Anti-Violence Coalition and Project H.U.D.S.O.N. Hudson County has a wealth of social service organizations and health care services, including those providing preventive care, though many residents experience barriers to accessing these resources. Residents remarked that Hudson County had a wealth of he alth care and social service assets. Residen ts noted that having a primary care doctor and being linked to a FQHC and/or a community -based organization were facilitating factors to accessing care. They also discussed the importance of culturally competent providers, including providers who spoke the ir language and looked like them. Veterans and those working with violence survivors highlighted that having peers and mentors who could provide trauma informed care helped to be engaged in care. Participants in the healthcare field unanimously noted a dec line in access to preventive care and mentioned this as a priority strategic area. Recommendations in this area included continuing to uplift partnerships and community engagement to bridge the care gap. Another recommendation included better communication about existing programs and services to reach multiple constituencies. Conclusion s Through this comprehensive and iterative assessment process, ten major areas were identified as community needs after gathering input through qualitative data from residen ts and stakeholders, feedback from a community priorities survey, and quantitative surveillance and secondary data. These included in no particular order : 28 Community Health Needs Assessment Survey Data, Bruno & Ridgway, 2021 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment xi Financial Insecurity Unemployment Food Insecuri ty Housing Chronic Diseases (e.g., heart disease, c ancer, diabetes) Infectious Diseases, including COVID -19 Violence Prevention & Safety Mental Health Substance Use Access to Preventive Care After a prioritization process with the Advisory Committee and discussions within the hospital taking into consider ation existing expertise, capacity, and experience, JCMC will focus on Access to Preventive Care; Chronic Disease Management, including Behavioral Health Services; Food Insecurity and Education; and Violence Prevention and Safety as priorities during the d evelopment of its implementation plan in 2023. JCMC will tackle these priority action areas as part of ongoing community engagement efforts and with an overarching emphasis on addressing systemic racism, racial injustice, and discrimination .2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 1 Introduction Community Health Needs Assessment Purpose and Goals A community health needs assessment (CHNA) is a systematic process to identify and analyze com munity health needs and assets, prioritize those needs, and then implement strategies to improve community hea lth. In 202 2, the RWJBarnabas Health Jersey City Medical Center (JCMC ) undertook the current CHNA process using a mixed -methods and participatory approach . JCMC is located in Jersey City, Hudson County, New Jersey , and is part of the RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH) system. RWJBH is a non -profit healthcare organization which includes 1 2 acute care hospitals, three acute care children's hospitals, a leading pediatric rehabilitation hospital, a freestanding acute behavioral health hospital, a clinically integrated network of ambulatory care centers, two trauma centers, a satellite emergenc y department, geriatric centers, the state's largest behavioral health network, ambulatory surgery centers, comprehensive home care and hospice programs, long term care facilities , fitness and wellness centers, retail pharmacy services, medical groups, dia gnostic imaging centers, a clinically integrated network and collaborative accountable care organization . As one of the licensed general acute care hospitals and one of two trauma centers within the system, JCMC admits nearly 16,000 inpatients and provides over 201,000 outpatient visits annually. In 202 1, the 34 8-bed hospital attended over 81,100 emergency department visits and delivered nearly 2,000 babies. JCMC is a DNV (which st ands for det norske veritas) fully accredited hospital and has been recognized for its excellence in providing care and support for the health and wellness of the Hudson County community. In early 2021, RWJBH hired Health Resources in Action (HRiA) , a no n-profit public health consultancy organization, to provide support, help facilitate, and conduct data analysis for the CHNAs across the system. HRiA worked closely with RWJBH, JCMC , the JCMC Community Outreach & Social Committee , and a Jer sey City/Hudson The RWJBH JCMC /Hudson County CHNA aims to gain a greater understanding of the issues that community residents face, how those issues are currently being addressed, and where there are gaps and opportunities to address these issues in the future. This report presents findings from the 2022 JCMC needs assessment processes, which was conducted between March -September 2022. The specific goals of this CHNA are to: Systematically identif y the needs, strengths, and resources of the community to inform future planning, Understand the curren t health status of the service area overall and its sub -populations within their social context, Engage the community to help determine community needs and social determinant of health needs, and Fulfill the IRS mandate for non -profit hospitals. Area of Focus This CHNA process aims to fulfill multiple purposes for a range of stakeholders. To be as inclusive as possible, t he focus area of the RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center /Hudson County CHNA encompasses JCMC's primary and secondary service areas in Hudson County . JCMC's primary service area include the 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 2 following Jersey City zip codes : includes Bayonne, Union City and Hoboken, which encompass the following zip codes : 07002, 07087, and 07030, respectively. Both the primary and secondary service areas are the focus of this CHNA , represented in Figure 1 below. Context for the Community Health Needs Assessment This CHNA was conducted during an unprecedented time, given the COVID -19 pandemic and the national movement for racial justice. Th is context had a significant impact on the assessment approach and content. COVID -19 Pandemic The country was still recovering from the novel coronavirus (COVID -19) pandemic when the activities of this assessment were conducted. This impacted both the CHN A data collection process and topics, as well as concerns that pa rticipants put forth during discussions in focus groups and interviews. In March 2022, at the beginning of this CHNA process, the COVID -19 pandemic had already been in effect for over two years. Logistically, the pandemic impacted the feasibility of conven ing in -person groups for the CHNA (e.g., subcommittees, focus groups, etc.) and the availability of key stakeholders and community members to participate in CHNA activities, given their focus on addressing immediate needs. Consequently, all data collection and engagement occurred in a virtual setting (e.g., telephone or video focus groups, interviews), and engagement of residents and stakeholders was challenging. (A more detailed descript ion of this engagement process may be found in the Methods section, an d COVID -19 data specific to this service area is provided in the Infectious and Communicable Disease section of this report.) Substantively, during the CHNA process, COVID -19 was and re mains a health concern for communities and has also exacerbated underl ying inequities and social needs. The pandemic brought to light both the Figure 1. Focused JCMC CHNA Area Map 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 3 capabilities and gaps in the healthcare system, the public health infrastructure, and social service networks. In this context, an assessment of the community's strengths and needs, a nd in particular the social determinants of health, is both critically important and logistically challenging. This CHNA should be considered a snapshot in time, which is consistent with public health best practices. Moving forward , the community should co ntinue to be engaged to understand how identified issues may evolve and what new issues or concerns may emerge over time. National Movement for Racial Justice Over the past few year s, sparked by the national protests for racial equity amidst the killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, and many others, national attention was focused on how racism is embedded in every system and structure of our country, inclu ding housing, education, employment, and healthcare. This context impa cted the content of the CHNA, including the design of data collection instruments and the input that was shared during interviews and focus groups. While racism and oppression have persi sted in this country for over 400 years, it is important to acknowledg e the recent focus on these issues in 202 2 in the form of increased dialogue, locally and nationally, as context for this assessment. Awareness of racism and discrimination among Hudson City residents was renewed in 2022 with ongoing incidents of anti -Asian hate crimes and the naming of Jersey City by the Buffalo mass shooter. Methods The following section details how data for the CHNA were compiled and analyzed, as well as the broader lens used to guide this process. Social Determinants of Health Framew ork While this CHNA aimed to be comprehensive, its data collection approach focused on the social and economic upstream issues that affect a community's health (Figure 2). Upstream Approaches to Health Having a he althy population is about more than delivering quality healthcare to residents. Where a person lives, learns, works, and plays all have an enormous impact on health. Health is not only affected by people's genes and lifestyle behaviors, but by u pstream fac tors such as employment status, quality of housing, and economic policies. Figure 2 provides a visual representation of these relationships, demonstrating how individual lifes tyle factors, which are closest to health outcomes, are influenced by more upstream factors, such as employment status and educational opportunities. 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 4 Figure 2. Social Determinants of Health Framework DATA SOURCE: World Health O rganization, Commission on the Social Determinants of Health, Towards a Conceptual Framework for Analysis and Action on the Social Determinants of Health, 2005. The data to which we have access is often a snapshot in time, but the people represented by th at data have lived their lives in ways that are constrained and enabled by economic circumstances, social context, and government policies. To this end, much of thi s report is dedicated to discussing the social, economic, and community context in which res idents live. We hope to understand the current health status of residents and the multitude of factors that influence health to enable the identification of priorit ies for community health planning, existing strengths and assets upon which to build, and ar eas for further collaboration and coordination. Health Equity Lens The influences of race, ethnicity, income, and geography on health patterns are often intertwin ed. In the United States, social, economic, and political processes ascribe social status ba sed on race and ethnicity, which may influence opportunities for educational and occupational advancement and housing options, two factors that profoundly affect he alth. Institutional racism, economic inequality, discriminatory policies, and historical opp ression of specific groups are a few of the factors that drive health inequities in the U.S. In the present report, health patterns for the Hudson County area are described overall, as well as areas of need for particular population groups. Understanding factors that contribute to health patterns for these populations can facilitate the identifica tion of data -informed and evidence -based strategies to provide all residents with the opportunity to live a healthy life. Approach and Community Engagement Pro cess The CHNA aimed to engage agencies, organizations, and community residents through differe nt avenues. The CHNA process was guided by strategic leadership from the RWJBH Systemwide CHNA Steering Committee, the JCMC Community Outreach & Social Impact Ste ering Committee , and the community overall. RWJBH System Engagement This CHNA is part of a se t of CHNAs being conducted across the entire RWJBH system. Each of these CHNAs use s a consistent framework and a minimum set of indicators but the approach and en gagement 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 5 process are tailored for each community. A Systemwide CHNA Steering Committee was con vened twice prior to the launch of JCMC CHNA process (early and late June 2021). This Steering Committee provided input and feedback on major data elements (e.g., secondary data key indicators, overall Table of Contents) and core prioritization criteria fo r the planning process. A list of Systemwide CHNA Steering Committee members can be found in Acknowledgments section. CHNA Advisory Committee Engagement A CHNA Advisory Committee was constituted to guide th e process . The Advisor y Committee included over 80 stakeholders representing a range of relevant fields and organizations throughout Hudson County. The CHNA Advisory Committee was engaged at critical intervals throughout this process. In March 2022, the Advisory Committee met for a kick -off meeting during which HRiA provided an overview of the CHNA process and Bruno & Ridgeway, Inc. presented the findings from a community survey the firm conducted in 2021. These two presentations were followed by a brief Q&A and discussion with Advisory Co mmittee members. After the meeting, Advisory Committee members were invited to participate in a survey to help identify what populations and sectors to engage in focus groups and key informant interviews. The results of this survey directly informed develo pment of an engagement plan to guide qualitative data collection. During the data collection process, Advisory Committee members also assisted with organizing focus groups with community residents, participating in key informant interviews, and/or connecti ng HRiA to stakeholders in the community. The Advisory Committee reconvened in October 2022. During this meeting, HRiA staff presented the findings from the CHNA process, inclu ding preliminary priorities that emerged upon review of the qualitative and sec ondary data. Advisory Committee members had the opportunity to ask questions, then discussed and voted on the top priorities for the hospital to consider when developing its implementation plan. A detailed description of the prioritization process can be f ound in the Prioritization Process and Priorities Selected for Planning section. In addition, t he JCMC Community Outreach & Social Impact Steering Committee was engaged through out the process as a means of obtaining feedback from internal JCMC stakeholders who have firsthand knowledge of the community. Members of the JCMC Steering Committee participated in the Advisory Committee activities a nd in a focus group in June 2022 . The JCMC Steering Committee reviewed the report in full and adopted it in a meeting in November 2022 . See Appendix A for a list of CHNA Advisory Committee members , which include the JCMC Steering Committee members . Commun ity Engagement Community engagement is described further below under the primary data collection methods. Capturing and lifting up a range of voices, especially those not typically represented in these processes, was a core component to this initiative. It should be noted that, due to the COVI D-19 pandemic, the community engagement for this CHNA occurred virtually. Additionally, while the CHNA aimed to engage a cross -section of individuals and to be inclusive of traditionally under -represented communities, outreach was challenging given the pan demic and competing priorities. Nevertheless, by engaging the community through multiple methods and in multiple languages, this CHNA aims to describe community strengths and needs during this unique time. Secondary Data: Review of Existing Secondary Dat a, Reports, and Analyses Secondary data are data that have already been collected for another purpose. Examining secondary data helps us to understand trends, provide a baseline, and identify differences by sub -groups . It also helps in guiding where primar y data collection can dive deeper or fill in gaps. 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 6 Secondary data for this CHNA were drawn from a variety of sources, including the U.S. Census American Community Survey (ACS), the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Federal Bureau o f Investigation Uniform Crime Reports, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, County Health Rankings, the New Jersey Department of Education, New Jersey Department of Health's New Jersey State Health Assessment Data (NJSHAD ), and a number of other agencies and o rganizations. This CHNA also utilizes reports from a variety of organizations at the community, state, and national level , including , but not limited to , the United Way of New Jersey's ALICE Study, The Partnership for a HealthierJC, and others. Additionall y, hospitalization data from the RWJBH system is also included in Appendix H. Secondary data were analyzed by the agencies that collected or received the data. Data are typically presented as frequencies (%) or rates per 100,000 population. It should be no ted that when the narrative makes comparisons between towns, by subpopulation, or with NJ overall, these are lay comparisons and not statistically significant differences. It should also be noted that for most social and economic indicators, the U.S. Cens us American Community Survey (ACS) 5 -year (201 6-2020) aggregate datasets were used over the one -year datasets, to improve statistical reliability for areas with small er population sizes and small population subgroups. Since the ACS uses a probability sampl ing technique, using the five -year aggregate dataset over the one - year data provides a larger sample size and more precision in its estimates. Primary Data Collection Primary data collection entailed a mixed methods approach consisting of interviews , focu s groups, and a community survey, as detailed below. Qualitative Discussion: Key Informant Interviews and Focus Groups Key Informant In terviews A total of seven key informant interview discussions were completed with 1 2 individuals by Zoom or telephone. Interviews were 35-60-minute semi -structured discussions that engaged institutional, organizational, and community leaders as well as front -line staff across sect ors. Discussions explored interviewees' experiences of addressing community needs and prioriti es for future alignment, coordination, and expansion of services, initiatives, and policies. Sectors represented in these interviews included: local public health department s, public education , housing services, the faith community, and those who serve/wor k with specific populations (e.g., immigrant community, LGBTQ residents, young people ). See Appendix B f or a list of organizations engaged through key informant interviews and Appendix C for the key informant interview guide. Focus Groups A total of 105 community residents participated in 6 virtual focus groups (telephone or video) conducted with specific populations of interest: veterans, Black residents, Spanish -speaking Latino residents, and Asian residents . Focus groups were up to 60 -minute semi -struct ured conversations and aimed to delve deeply into the community's needs, strengths, and opportunities for the future and to gather feedback on priorities f or action. Please see Appendix D for the focus group facilitator's guide. In addition, a guided disc ussion was carried out with the JCMC Community Outreach & Social Impact Steering Committee , who se members are in direct contact with Hudson City residents in their role as health care providers, hospital administrators, leaders, and community residents the mselves. The discussion lasted 60 minutes and was conducted via Zoom. The discussion aimed to determine 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 7 perceptions of the strengths and needs of the Hudso n County community served by JCMC, and identify the sub-populations most affected , to explore how the se issues can be addressed in the future , and t o identify opportunities for JCMC to address the community needs more effectively moving forward. Analyses The collected qualitative information was coded and then analyzed thematically by data analysts for main categories and sub -themes. Analysts identified key themes that emerged across all groups and interviews as well as the unique issues that were noted for specific populations. Throughout the qualitative findings included in this report, the term \"partic ipants\" is used to refer to key informant interview and focus group participants. Uniq ue issues that emerged among a group of participants are specified as such. Frequency and intensity of discussions on a specific topic were key indicators used for extrac ting main themes. While differences between towns are noted where appropriate, analyse s emphasized findings common across the service area. Selected paraphrased quotes \u2014without personal identifying information \u2014are presented in the narrative of this report t o further illustrate points within topic areas. Community Survey A community prioriti es survey was developed and administered over a six-month period from April to August 2021 by the survey firm Bruno & Ridgway, who was contracted directly by the RWJBH sy stem. The survey focused on health issues and concerns that impact the community; comm unity safety and quality of life; personal health attitudes, conditions , and behaviors; barriers to accessing health care; discrimination when receiving medical care; and the impact of COVID -19 and vaccination compliance. The survey was administered online and was available in paper in 5 languages (English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, and Chinese). Outreach for survey dissemination was conducted with assistance from the RWJBH system, the hospital, and its community partners, as well as through social media and the web . Additionally, an online panel sample was recruited to capture additional survey responses from specific areas to augment the larger sample. Postcards with QR codes that linked to the survey were distributed at vaccination events for community members to take while they waited for their COVID -19 vaccine. The final sample of the community priorities survey comprised 273 respondents who were residents of Hudso n County. Appendix F provides a table with demographic composition of survey respondents. Respondents to the Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment Survey were predominately White, female, and high er socioeconomic status. About 74% were employed f ull-time. Throughout this report, Hudson County residen ts who participated in the Community Health Needs Assessment Survey are referred to as \"respondents\" (whereas focus group members and interviewees are referred to as \"participants\" for distinction) . Analyses Frequencies were calculated for each survey que stion. Not all respondents answered every question; therefore, denominators in analyses reflect the number of total responses for each question, which varied by question. Statistical testing (Z -tests) was conducted across sub -groups to determine whether there were significance differences between groups. Survey data by race/ethnicity specifically is presented in this report. Racial/ethnic groups are delineated by a letter (A, B, C, D). When a graph has a letter next to the bar, it indicates that the group f or that bar has a statistically significant different frequency of responses compared to the group of the letter shown (e.g., when an A is on the bar of White respondents, it indicates that percentage of White respondents answering the question in that 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 8 particular way is statistically significantly different than Asian respondents). Significant differences at 90% confidence levels are presented in the report. Data Limitations As with all data collection efforts, there are several limitations that should be acknowledged. Numerous secondary data sources were drawn upon in creating this report and each source has its own set of limitations. Overall, it should be noted that differe nt data sources use differe nt ways of measuring similar variables (e.g., different questions to identify race/ethnicity). There may be a time lag for many data sources from the time of data collection to data availability. Some data are not available by sp ecific population groups (e .g., race/ethnicity) or at a more granular geographic level (e.g., town or municipality) due to small sub -sample sizes. In some cases, data from multiple years may have been aggregated to allow for data estimates at a more granul ar level or among specific groups. With many organizations and residents focused on the pandemic and its effects, community engagement and timely response to data collection requests were challenging. Additionally, with its online administration method, the community survey used a convenience sample. Since a convenience sample is a type of non -probability sampling, there is potential selection bias in who participated or was asked to participate in the survey. Due to this potential bias, results cannot ne cessarily be generalized to the larger population. Similarly, while interviews and focus groups provide valuable insights and important in -depth context, due to their non -random sampling methods and small sample sizes, results are not necessarily generaliz able. Due to COVID -19, focu s groups and interviews were also conducted virtually, and therefore, while both video conference and telephone options were offered, some residents who lack reliable access to the Internet and/or cell phones may have experienced difficulty participating. This report should be considered a snapshot of an unprecedented time, and the findings in this report can be built upon through future data collection efforts. 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 9 Population Characteristics Population Overview According to the 201 6-2020 American Community S urvey (U.S. Census), Hudson County is the fourth most populous county in New Jersey (671,923 residents) . The Jersey City Medical Center's primary and secondary service area comprises 6 Jersey City zip codes (totaling 330,002 residents) , and the cities of Bayonne (65,112 residents) , (68,073) . There has been great variability in population growth across the areas examined. Whereas New Jersey ov erall and Hudson County , specifically, have seen minimal changes in total population between the periods 2011 -2015 and 2016 -2020 , Jersey City zip code 07302 experienced a population growth explosion (18.5 %), whereas zip codes 07306 and 07307 experienced an important population exodus during the same period ( -7.1% and -9.9%, resp ectively) . The Union City declined (-0.4% and -0.8%, respectively ) and that of Hoboken increased (1.6%) minimally over this time (Table 1). Table 1.

Age distribution data by town and gender can be found in the Appendix of additional data. 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 10 Figure 3. Age Distribution, by State and County, 2016 -2020 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2011 -2015 and 2016 -2020 When examining age distribution data by race/ethnicity in Hudson County, children under 18 made up a greater percentage of the population among persons of Other Race (26.9%) and Hispanic/Latino s (15.7%) , followed by Black (14.6%) , and a smaller proportion of Asian (11.2%) and White (10.3%) residents. Adults aged 65 and over comprise d 9.9% of the White population compared to 6 .1% of the Asian population , see Table 2. Table 2.

Racial, Ethnic, and Language Diversity Racial and Ethnic Composition Focus group members and interviewe es described their communities as racially and ethnically diverse and valued this diversity as one of Hudson County's greatest assets. The secondary data support these perceptions. Hudson County is predominantly made up of Hispanic/Latino residents, which make up 40.4% of its population , followed by White non - Hispanic (28.5%) , Asian (17.0%), and Black (9.8%). Huds on County has proportionally more Hispanic/Latino and Asian residents than New Jersey as a whole ( Figure 4). See the Appendix for detailed data tables. Figure 4. Racial and Ethnic Distribution, by State and County, 2020 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, Decennial Census of Population and Housing, 2020 Data labels not shown for p ercentages <4% . In 2016 -2020, the racial and ethnic distributions varied widely across Hudson County (Table 3) with Hoboken and Union City being the most homogenous cit ies, and zip codes within Jersey City being quite diverse . For example, in Jersey City zip code 07310, 57.3% of the population identified as Asian, compared to 3.5% in Union City . The largest Black population was found in zip codes 07305 and 07304, which made up 4 4.1% and 3 4.8% of residents, compared to 2. 3% in Union Hispanic/Latino White, non-Hispanic Other, non-Hispanic \"Jersey City's greatest strength has always been diversity .\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 12 Residents identifying as Hispanic/Latino made up 76.7% of the Union City and 42.2 % of the Jersey City zip code 07307 population , in contrast to 9. 3% in zip code 07310. Residents identifying as non -Hispanic White were concentrat ed in Hoboken ( 67.1% of residents) , followed by Bayonne ( 44.3 %), and made the smallest proportion of the population in zip code 07305 (11. 7%).

Multiple waves o f migration resulted in pockets of recent and not -so-recent immigrants from many Latin American and Caribbean as well as South east Asian countries . Secondary data show varying levels of the foreign -born population across Hudson County. More than two out of every five Hudson County residents are foreign born (43.6%), double the percentage of foreign -born residents in New Jersey as a wh ole (22.7%) . In 201 6-2020, the foreign - born population ranged from 1 9.4% in Hoboken to 62.8% in Jersey City zip code 07310 (Figure 5). In Hudson County, the most common countries of origin for immigrant residents were India and the Dominican Republic (making up 12.8% and 12.1% of the immigrant population, respectively) . The majority of o ther immigrants were from Latin America and the Caribbean , primarily Ecuador, Cuba, and Colombia (see Table 4). \"The [Filipino] community has strong roots, and generations of families that have made Jersey City their home .\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 13 Figure 5.

The anti -immigrant rhetoric of recent years, coupled with increases in raids targeting immigrants, has severely affected the men tal well -being of this community , provoking undue stress and anxiety . This is coupled by barriers to access basic protections related to employment and housing due to their legal status. Further, these populations have been among the most affected by COVID -19, both in terms of s ickness, as well as in terms of job loss. Whereas free or low-cost medical care is available to everyone regardless of documentation status via the FQHCs and other providers , participants commented that more efforts are needed to reach the entire eligible population and bridge the care gap. Language Diversity A majority of Hudson County residents over age five (59.1%) reported speaking a language other than English at home in 201 6-2020, with large local diffe rences. For example, almost five in six Union Co unty residents (81.8% ) and four in six in Jersey zip codes 07306 (63.9%), 07307 (64.2%), and 07310 (65.2%) spoke a language other than English at home , compared to one in four Hoboken residents (26.4%) (Figure 6). A variety of languages are spoken across Hudson County, as indicated in the secondary data and supported by qualitative d iscussions. The most spoken languages other than English are Spanish (37.1%) , other Indo -European languages (e.g., , Arabic (2.6%), Chinese (2.4%), and Tagalog (2.1%) (Table 5). Other languages spoken include Russian, Polish and other Slavic languages ; French , Haitian or Cajun ; Korean ; and Vietnamese, reflec ting the county's diverse commun ities. The distribution of these languages is not even. For example, t hree -quarters of residents in Union City speak Spanish (75.8%) , while 24.9% of residents in Jersey City zip code 07310 speak other Indo -European languages and 19.7% speak Chinese . There are also , for example, pockets of Arabic speakers in Bayonne and Jersey City zip codes 07306 and 07304 ; while the Filipino community is largely concentrated in Jersey City zip codes 07304, 07305 , and 07306 . \"This a time when immigrants are feeling unsafe.

Based on resident feedback, Hudson County is a welcoming place for foreign -born persons, non -English speakers, and people of diverse ethnic backgrounds . A Filipino resident expressed it as, \"the [Filipino] community has strong roots, and generations of families tha t have made Jersey City their home.\" Overwhelmingly, r esidents indicated that they enjoyed the opportunity to learn about different cultures, and to access foods and other cultural elem ents from a variety of regions. As a focus group participant explained, \"It's a multicultural city so you have several different ethnicities... you get to learn about the food and people's culture.\" Residents overall also valued that medical and social servi ces providers looked like them and spoke to them in their native langua ge. However, opinions differed in terms of the availability of multilingual providers and providers of color. Whereas resident s of Indian descent indicated that \"there are plenty of Ind ian, multiple language speakers, physicians in the JCMC and in the comm unity ,\" Latino residents were more nuanced noting that whereas the federally qualified health centers ( FQHCs ) had ample Spanish speakers, hospitals in the area needed more staff that spoke the ir language. While diversity was a substantial community streng th, participants noted that it could also be a challeng e to engagement . In Hudson County, 40.5% of residents were not proficient in English in 2016 - 2020 , ranging from 18.4% in Je rsey City zip code 07310 to 48.3% i n Union City . Lack of English proficiency c an pose a barrier to entering the professional workforce, learning, and accessing healthcare. Those working in the social sector worr ied about populations not reached with information or services. In the words of a public health official, \"we talk to funde rs all the time about how to translate health information into other languages, how to connect to communities. We talk about it all the time, how to get into mosques, communicate in other ways besides English newspapers, how to create equity for people who are following the news.\" In addition, lack of English -proficiency can lead to discrimination. According to survey data, 22.7% of Asian respondents and 17.6% of Latino community respondents specifically described being discriminated against because of lang uage/speech issues when receiving medical care (discussed in greater detail in the Discrimination and Racism section of this report.) \"I do feel welcome by healthcare providers, but I have experienced going with my parents who are immigrants with heavy accents, and I have experienced miscommunication. \" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 17 Figure 7.

About 2% of the Hudson County population are veterans, with the city of Bayonne having the highest percentage of the areas observed (3.9%) ( Figure 8). The race/ethnicity of veterans in Hudson County mimics the di versity of the county's population . Hudson County has proporti onately more veterans who identify as Asian (6.1%), Black (15.6%), and Latino (29.1%) residents than the state (Figure 9), with important variation acro ss neighborhoods. A majority of veterans in Jersey City zip codes 07304 and 07305 identify as Black (42.6% and 63.4%, respectively) , whereas 40.8% of veterans i n Jersey City zip code 07310 identify as Asian, and 68.6% of veterans in Union City identify as Latino.

When examining the educational attain ment of veterans in Hudson County, we observe that most veterans did not have a bachelor's degree or higher (71.4%) ( Figure 10). Only 10.8% of residents obtained a college degree in Jersey City zip code 07304, where many Black veterans reside . Employment and education, together with mental and physical health, are closely related to poverty. A hig her proportion of veterans in Hudson County live below the poverty line than in New Jersey (7.5% vs. 5.2%, respectively). This proportion is much higher in Jersey City 07306, where one in five veterans liv e in poverty, and Jersey City zip code 07305, where 18.0% do. It is important to rememb er that the poverty line is substantially below a livable income and has become even more so recently with high rates of inflation . Special issues faced by veterans are discussed throughout the report in the specific top ic area sections. Figure 10.

For example, j obs that pay a living wage enable workers to live in neighborhoods that promote health (e.g., built environments that promote physica l activity and resident engagement, better access to affordable healthy foods), and provide income and benefits to access health care. In contrast, unemployment, underemployment, and job instability make it difficult to afford housing, goods and services t hat are linked with health and health car e, and also contribute to stressful life circumstances that affect multiple aspects of health . Community Strengths and Assets Understanding the resources and services available in a community \u2014as well as their distr ibution \u2014helps to elucidate the assets that can be drawn upon to address community health, as well as any gaps that might exist. Strong Community and Partnerships In addition to diversity noted previously , another strength mentioned by participants was solidarity and a strong sense of community . Time and time again, participants noted that neighbors came together to help those in need . As a resident noted, \"My specific neighborhood is very close knit, you know the people in the area and people are willing t o help you. For example, when it snows , I've had young kids, young teenagers ask like, can Jersey City (07304) Jersey City (07305) Jersey City (07306) Jersey City (07307) Jersey City (07310) Union City2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 21 Residents remarked that the community was able to organize and take action to address people's needs and this came to the forefront throughout the pa ndemic , including through generous donations . A healthcare administ rator echoed this sentiment , \"these are communities that show up when the need is there, and we saw that during the COVID pandemic. We raised over a million dollars for an emergency respons e fund, from old donors and new donors.\" At an institutional level, another strength are the robust partnerships established among multiple organizations and across sectors , including grassroots organizations , government, small businesses, social service s agencies, and health care centers . These collaborations are exemplified by the Partnership for a HealthierJC, made up of nearly 300 member organizations. A public health official noted, \"We have great partners. Hudson County is very tight, so we all work together. \" As a health administrator said when reflecting on the response to COVID -19, \"As organizations ... who did demonstrate that more than whatever resources were available to our community , we all jumped in and that includes J ersey City Medical Center . We were able to get people in and out of the hospitals quickly and people were able to communicate with each other .\" This was echoed by public health staff from different areas of Hudson County, as exemplified by what this participant from Bayonne said, \"Whenever there is an emergency , Bayonne comes together as a community to help people out, through donations or referrals for services.\" Public Services and Programs Some participants indicated that their elected officials were a source of strength in Hu dson County. A diverse array of residents, including from the Latino, Asian, and LGBTQ+ community, indicated being represented and supported by government leaders. One example of support for the LGBTQ+ community was the recent passing of the law to let stu dents use bathrooms that are consistent with their gender identity , considered an important step in fostering welcoming and safe spaces for gender nonbinary youth. Residents noted that the Jersey City government was responsive to their needs and that they received abundant support during the COVID -19 pandemic, as expressed by a Latino resident, \"The mayor's office provides very good services ; for example, if someone has to travel far to get to the doctor, or if they need translation of a document to Spanish \u2014you can call the mayor's office for everything.\" Overall, residents indicated that Hudson County offers many services to people to ensure that residents live well and can access their basic ne eds. The map below shows the distribution of hospitals, schoo ls, and childcare centers in the area. There are four acute care hospitals as well as 151 schools and 301 childcare centers in the JCMC service area (Figure 12). \"I'm new to Jers ey City, but I noticed since doing Covid work in June that there is a strong sense of community. \" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 22 DATA SOURCE: New Jersey Geographic Information Network (NJ GIN), Schools and Child Care Centers, 2018 and Acute Care Hospitals, 2020 As one reside nt summed up, \"...there is something going on almost every week to help with food, home purchases, that's one of the things I really love about Jersey City.\" A Hoboken r esident expressed something similar , noting that a strength in Hoboken were the \"strong non -profit organizations and religious organizations that provide supportive services related to housing assistan ce and information, nutritional support, recreational a ctivities for children, tutoring ...\" Latino r esidents discussed how the county offered resources in the community to support people, including people who are low -income, undocumented , and/ or without health insurance . Other Community Assets Community survey respondents partially agreed with these themes. When asked how much they agreed or disagreed with a number of statements about their community, responses were similar to when this survey was administered in 2019. The strengths identified by the greatest pr oportion of responden ts in 2021 were that it was easy to find fresh fruits and vegetables in their communities (73.6 %), that their communities had safe outdoor places to walk and play (70.3 %), and that their community was a good place to raise a family (59 .7%) and to socialize (58.2%) (Figure 13). These were the same top responses in 2019. Figure 12. Community Assets Map of Hudson Count y, 2018 & 2020 \"From my experience, over 20 years, I fee l that the greatest strength s are the community -based organizations. We have a wide range of individuals who form different communities, even small grassroots community -based organizations, to engage people in healthy ways .\" - Key informant interviewee 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 23 Figure 13. Percent of Community Survey Respondents Noting Strengths in Their Community (Agree or Completely Agree wi th Statements) (n=2 73), 2021 DATA SOURCE: Community Health Needs Assessment Survey Data, Bruno & Ridgway, 2021 However, responses to these questions varied by race/ethnicity . For example, as can be observed in Figure 14, White respondents were significantly more likely than Asian, Black, and Latino respondents to agree or c ompletely agree that their community had safe outdoor places to walk and play. As described in the Methods section, when a graph of community survey data has a letter next to the bar, it indicates that the group for that bar has a statistically significant different frequency of responses compared to the group of the letter shown . As shown, whereas 81.0% of Wh ite respondents perceived outdoor spaces as safe, only 59.1% of Asian respondents did so. Whereas there were no significant d ifferences by respondents' race/ethnicity to the statement about having spaces to socialize, Asian (63.6%) and White (66.7%) respondents more often indicated that the community was a good place to raise their family than Black (34.6%) respondents (Figure 15).

School Environment and Health A positive school environment is an important determinant of physical and mental wellbeing, as well as academic succ ess, staying in school, and opting to continue on to higher education. An interview ee who was a member of the LGBTQ+ community lauded schools for their efforts to make school safe and welcoming to all youth. In their words, \"[LGBTQ+] youth are still dealin g with bullying, [but] schools are reaching out to learn and make spaces safer. School leaders come in to engage us as a liaison, to organize school clubs that are inclusive and to receive cultural competency training from us.\" Conversely, being healthy is a key factor in being academically successful. Schools play an important role in facilitating access to care and helping students stay healthy. A school administrator described some of the public school 's efforts to address the mental health needs of students, \"We've been trying through the schools with our resources to really embed more social and emotional [support to] help students overcome challenges, develop resilience, and be able to speak about thei r emotions. [We have] incorporated that through th e curriculum, through our school counselors, through our school psychologist.\" Many students also face poverty and food insecurity; in providing free or low -cost lunches , schools also play an important role in ensuring basic nutrition for children. Public School ing Focus group and interview participants discussed how the public school system in Hudson County faces a variety of issues. One is a lack of sufficient resources to attend to the needs of high -need population groups. There is a perpetual shortage of qualified educators , particularly in those areas where teachers need additional certifications or schooling. An education adminis trator emphasized that more qualified Special Ed ucation teachers, bilingual teachers , and content area teachers, like those that teach Science and Math, are needed to meet the needs of the student population . Another issue that came up was the lack of affordable after school programs, particularly important for children of low-income earners. In some areas of Hudson County, su ch as Hobo ken, a problem identified by participants was that there is insufficient space to accommodate the growing number of school children . Residents expressed that \"[population] growth was not planned ,\" leading to overcrowding in public and charter sch ools. Residents discussed how new buildings and improved infrastructure for schools were needed to accommoda te the influx of new residents coming to the new condominium buildings. In spite of these challenges, most Hudson County residents indicated that public school leadership was supportive of students' needs and open to partnerships with different organizations to better serve the community. Many residents remarked that the school leadership was attuned to the needs of students and their families , many of whom face multiple struggles . Given the large immigrant community in Hudson County, schools must accommodate to the needs of English -language learners. 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 26 Key informant interviewees indicated that Hudson County public schools fall along a broad spectrum encompassing both the top-ranking , as well as the lower performing , schools in New Jersey . School p erformance is determined largely by the socioeconomic situation of the community that draws the student population. There is an inverse association between socioeconomic status and high school graduation rates. Key informant interviewees noted that s tudents experiencing poverty often had to drop out of school to start working and contribute an income to their families. These students' vision for the future of tentimes does not include college as a career path unless they have access to a mentor who can help them enter a professional career . Key i nformant interviewees explained that low -income students face d multiple obstacles to entering college , including not being able to afford it; having to full-time to support the family; and not seeing the usefulness of a college degree . Based on this contex t, key informant interviewees indicated that p ublic schools were trying to equip students' transition into the workfo rce by incorporating classes and training related to workplace readiness. \"We've been working on it trying to incorporate more careers, not just OK you're gonna graduate and go to college and then get a job. But, you kno w, addressing the needs of those stu dents who will not go to college .\" Inequities in school performance are confirmed by graduation rate data from different Hudson County districts . Whereas in 2020 -2021 the Hoboken Public School District had graduation rates slightly above those of New Jer sey as whole (93.6% and 92.6%, respectively), the public school districts of Bayonne, Union City, and Jersey City had lower graduation rates , with significant disparities by race/et hnicity within districts ( Table 6). For example, 95.3% of Asian students graduated from High School in Bayonne in 2020 -2021, compared to 86.4% of Black children and 78.5% of Latino children. Additional information on differences in educational attainment by race/ethnicity and by town is a vailable in Appendix F.

They need to graduate from high school, but they also need a job because economically they need to go work. It's a challenge.\" - Key informant interviewee 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 27 Promising Initiatives To better address the needs of community, the Jersey City Board of Education has partnered with educators, families, and the community as a whole to launch a promising model known as 'community schools. ' Community schools provide additional services than regu lar school s to meet the needs of students and families . In addition to regular school offerings, community schools aim to connect students and parents with a wide range of services , including afterschool programs, counseling, and social services. This model has helped to improv e attendance , grades, and student and parent engagement. Some of the schools have brought in health clinics that offer nutrition and h ealth care to both students and the ir families . According to a school administrator , the key to the success of one of the community schools is that \"it's a very cohesive community,\" with \"good leadership at the school that has been good in working with the community, the providers ,\" and the fact that \"the staff, the teachers are all vested and making it successful .\" Another successful initiative that participants discussed was The Tiger's Den at Snyder High School, a result of a partnership between JCMC , The NJ Department of Childre n and Families, and the Jersey City Board of Education. The Tiger's Den offer s free, confidential social services to students, families, and staff , includ ing psychological counseling, vocational counseling , workplace readiness p rograms, academic support, summer employment, and after school programs . The Tiger's Den also assigns students with mentors who they can talk to about their problems and guide them to resolve issues in a positive way. Graduation rate for students participa ting in The Tiger's Den was 99% compared to 60% in the school overall. These are promising strateg ies to help more students from low -income families finish High School and either enter the workforce in stable employment or continue on to college , two path ways to facilitate the transition to the middle class . Inequality Growing inequality , exacerbated as much by the COVID -19 pandemic a s by policies and the existing economic model , was a theme that came out strongly in all focus groups and interviews. Most residents across racial/ethnic groups indicated that Jersey City was catering to the wealthy and that income distribution was unequal. As one participant summarized , \"We have the multimillion front, you know , waterfront properties and then we have below th e poverty line, urban homes with very urban problems.\" Residents expressed frustration and a sense of injustice witnessing the rapid concentration of w ealth in fewer hands, while employment loss and inflation lead more people into poverty. Residents consis tently expressed that the city was catering to affluent families in detriment to middle - and low -inco me residents , and this was evidenced by policies related to real estate credit s; infrastructure and public services investments ; and a regressive taxation structur e. Often, residents attributed racial/ethnic tension to this growing inequality , as expressed by these words , \"From our perspective you do have a lot of stressors around that, especially with gentrification, there is more tension with people origin ally from the neighborhood as opposite to newcomers. Tax breaks in one section, and in the African American section you can't get your garbage picked up, there is tension and anger from the 'tale of two cities' .\" As these words capture, there is also a racial/ethnic component superimposed on inequality , as Latinos and Black residents are disprop ortionately affected by household and neighborhood poverty. A Black resident reflected thus on the situation , \"they're not really including us in the expansion of Je rsey City. Jersey City is up and coming, but they're not making room for low to middle income people... And this is people of all races, they're not gonna pay all that money for taxes, and there are no jobs here.\" 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 28 Neighborhood concentrated poverty compound s the effect of household povert y. Explaining the linkage between income , hopelessness, and violence, a resident noted, \"...And then there's the level of community violence. Feeling really stuck in that cycle that they're in , violence, income or job opportun ities, social determinants of health like housing. People are getting push ed out as more development is coming. \" On reflecting about her vision for the future, a key informant interviewee synthesized the voices of many residents , \"My biggest wish for this community is that we don't have such an economically diverse community . If there's a way to really help the families with the lowest resource economic resources to really have a more stable financial sense, that would be the ideal. \" Inequality is reflect ed in many of the section s of th is report, including education, employment and workforce, income and financial security, and access to healthcare , among others . For example, i ncome inequality is greater in Hudson County (5.9) than in New Jersey overall (5.1) (Figure 16). Income inequality is calculated as the ratio of household income at the 80th percentile to that at the 20th percentile . A higher number indicates a greater income gap between the wealthiest and the poorest households. Figure 16. Income Inequality (80th to 20th Percentile Income Ratio), by State and County, 2016 -2020 DATA SOURCE:U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey as reported by County Health Rankings, University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2016 -2020 NOTE : The ratio of household income at the 80th percentile to that at the 20th percentile, where the incomes of all households in a county are listed from highest to lowes t, the 80th percentile is the level of income at which only 20% of households have higher incomes, and the 20th percentile is the level of income at which only 20% of households have lower incomes. A higher inequality ratio indicates greater division betwe en the top and bottom ends of the income spectrum. 5.15.9 New Jersey Hudson County \"It's like they don't want us to be here anymore, they're just welcoming the rich and affluent... It looks like Jersey City is trying to cater to the affluent instead of the people who grew up here.\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 29 Employment and Workforce Employment can confer income, benefits, and economic stability - factors that promote physical and mental health. Two main employment -related issues came out of the focus groups and interviews . On the one hand, many noted that employment opportunities were limited in Hudson County , particularly as a result of the pandemic . Often, they mentioned being unemployed or und eremployed. Residents also said that employment opportunities we re limited even among people with college degrees without the right connections. Job instability affected many residents across multiple groups. Multiple residents complained of the dearth of well-paid employment opportunities , that offer employees health and social benefits, a fixed income , and a living wage. Many of the residents we interviewed were working poor, who, despite working , could not afford housing, or had to choose between rent, food or medicine. Indeed, in 2018, one in five of the County's households were Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed (ALICE), meaning that although employed, they did not earn enough to support their families (Figure 17), ranging from 5.1% in Jersey City zip code 07310 to 33% in Union City . Figure 17. Percent Households Falling into ALICE Population, by State and County, 2018 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2014 -2018 as reported by United Ways of New Jersey, Alice in New Jersey: A Financial Hardship Study, 2020 Participants talked about the ch allenges of the COVID -19 pandemic on essential front -line and lower wage workers, many of whom lost their jobs, either temporarily or permanently . Latino partici pants mentioned that many factories and restaurants closed during the pandemic and that they could not find jobs. The effects of COVID -19 on employment are also reflected in quantitative data. Black and Latino respondents were significantly more likely tha n White respondents to report having lost income due to COVID -19 (46.2%, 41.2% , and 27.0%, respectively) (Figure 18). Like New Jerse y as a whole, in 2019, prior to the pandemic, Hudson County reported the lowest u nemployment rate (3.1%) in recent years according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (Figure 19). However, unemployment rates in 2020 spiked at 10.2% , recover ing slightly to 6.3% in 2021.

Racial/ethnic differences between groups noted by lettering next to the bars in the graph. Figure 19. Unemployment Rate, by State and County, 2012 -2021 DATA SOURCE: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Local Area Unemployment Statistics, 2012 -2021 NOTE: Not seasonally adjusted The 2016 -2020 aggregated data from the American Community Survey show th at unemployment rates across Hudson County ranged from 2.4% in Jersey City zip code 07302 to 7.0% in Jersey City zip code 07305 and 9.2% in Jersey City zip code 07304 ( Table 7). However , this varies by race/ethnici ty (Table 8). Indeed, unemployment rates map onto racial/ethnic groups; as discussed in the section on population characteristics, residents in zip code 070302 are predominantly White (40.1%) and Asian (32.2%), whereas over two -thirds of residents in zip codes 07304 and 07305 are Black and Latino (Table 3). The highest unemployment rates in Hudson County were among Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander residents (35.9%), followed by A merican Indian and Alaska Native residents (10.1%) in 2016 -2020, and the lowest were among Asian (3.5%) and White (4.0%) residents ( Table 8).

Fewer than four in ten respondents agreed that \"there are job opportunities in my area.\" White respondents were more likely than respondents of any other race/ethnicity to perceive that th ere were employment opportunities in their area, although the differences were not statistically significant (Figure 20). 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 32 Figure 20. Percent of Community Survey Respondents Who Agreed/Completely Agreed with Statement \"There are Job Opportunities in by Race/Ethnicity (n=273) , 2021 DATA SOURCE: Commun Survey Data, Bruno & Ridgway, 2021 NOTE: Statistical significance shown at 90% confidence levels. Racial/ethnic differences between groups noted by lettering next to the bars in the graph. It is also important to underst and overlapping conditions that may affect entering the workforce. O ver the same period, unemployment rates in Hudson County were highest among women (5.6% among women compared to 4.9% among men) ( Table 22 in the A ppendix ) and young people (18.8% among 16 - 19 year -olds and 11.0% among 20 to 24 year -olds) ( Table 23 in the Appendix ). The greatest difference in the female -to-male employment gap was in Jersey City zip code 07304 (10.8% female vs. 7.7% male unemployment rate), an area with many residents of color. Residents noted that certain population subgroups in Hudson County faced more obstacles than others when seeking employment opportunities . Because of stigma and discrimi nation, Black trans women experienced multiple challenge s to having a professional career and securing living -wage employment. As one key informant interviewee from the LGBTQ+ community explained , \"Black trans women experience the most barriers to employme nt. They become sex workers for survival. They have difficult experiences applying to jobs. They are ridiculed when applying to places.\" The options for gainful employment also appeared particularly dire for veterans, who are disproportionately Black and L atino. All veteran focus group participants agreed that the only types of jobs available to them either did not pay a living wage or were government jobs. Veteran focus group members expressed frustration at not being able to access satisfying and stimulat ing employment with growth opportunities. Residents suggested that more should be done to incentivize employers , including private employ ers, to hire trans and veteran residents. When trying to interrupt the cycle of violence, whether domestic or communit y violence, gainful employment is critical to help survivors get on their feet. As a staff member from a violence interruption program me ntioned, \" Employment is always an issue because you can tell folks a better day is coming, but what is the alternative? We try to never use that language unless we have an alternative. My main thing is stay safe and healthy. With the grant we just received , we have an opportunity to have 40 Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 33 participants, and we train them in electrical, plumbing, HVAC, and carpentry. No w we have something to say, I've got a job for you as long as you learn a skill and graduate from this program.\" Time and time again participants mentioned that lack of secure and well -paid employment was an important contributor to depression. As a publi c health official said, \"Mental health issues happen because [veterans] cannot find jobs, they don't have the mone y, they have to move in with their parents.\" And she continued , \"it's offensive to put someone who served, someone who earned a degree, behind a cash register... why are companies not stepping up, instead of making exorbitant profits, and training?\" Another resident said, \"[Not having a career], has been a part of my mental health depression.\" Income and Financial Security Income is a powerful s ocial determinant of health that influences where people live and their ability to access resources which affects health and well -being. The effects of poverty \u2014food and housing insecurity, underinsurance , and stress leading to poor physical and mental heal th\u2014are compounded by environ mental factors. Areas with more concentrated poverty are also those with lower -performing schools, higher rates of community violence and substance use, buildings in worse conditions, and food deserts. Discussing issues related to children, a key informant interviewee said, \"We have, you know, that urban child with very limited resources, poverty, a lot of the issues of poverty and inter generational poverty, with grandparents raising children. \" Many households face financial ins ecurity across many groups . Both children and youth face substantial insecurity, as well as older adults living on retirement. As discussed in the sections on Inequality and Employment and Workforce , inflation was a major concern for low -income earners as wages have not kept up with the cost of living . People across the spectrum were affected and many residents expressed concerns about the future, mention ing that w ages were not keeping up with inflation , and as a result, more people were experiencing povert y. Income and health are interrelated. Participants mentioned that p eople with chronic illnesses and disabilities often face d financial vulnerability as they were unable to work due to their health . In the words of a resident, \"There's income barriers, w hich runs into all areas. When you have physical health issues, that leads to loss of income.\" On the other hand, residents noted that healthcare was not a priority when income was limited. Therefore, insufficient income becomes a barrier to accessing heal th insurance, preventive health care, and even treatment to manage chronic diseases. Many residents described that low -wage earners were faced with the dilemma of having to choose between fo od, rent, or medicine. Household Income and Poverty In Hudson Cou nty, financial wellbeing and insecurity varied by area. According to the 2016 -2020 American Community Survey (U.S. Census), while the median household income for Hudson County ($75,062) was below that of New Jersey ($8 5,245) as a whole , the range in househ old income showed stark disparities. The median annual household income in 201 6-2020 ranged from $49,457 in Union City , where a majority of residents were Latino, to $1 53,438 in Hoboken , with a majority of residents are White (Figure 21). Jersey City zip codes 07304, 07305 , 07306, and 07307 all reported having median household income s below the state average. \"People on the fringe of poverty have suffered .\" - Key informant interview ee 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 34 Figure 21. Median Household Income, by State and County, 2016 -2020 DATA SOURCE: U .S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 When analyzing these figures further, data show that Black and Latino households had lower median household incomes relative to the average across Hudson County. While Asian ($1 16,309) and White ($100,853) households reported incomes that were 55% and 34% higher than median household income in Hudson County ($ 75,062 ), respectively, Black ($ 53,196) and Hispanic/Latino ($ 52,408) households earned 29% and 3 0% below the county median , respectively (Table 9).

Around one in three households in Hoboken (36.9%), Jersey City zip code 07302 (32.4%), and Jersey City zip code 0 7310 (34.8%) had earning s of $200,000 or higher in 201 6-2020 (Figure 22.) On the other hand, more than two in five households in Jersey City zip codes 0730 4, 07305 , and 07306 earn ed a household income of $50,000 or less ; and half of the households in Union City w ere in this situation. Figure 22. Distribution of Household Income, b y State, County, and Town, 2016 -2020 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 The percentage of Hudson County residents living below the poverty level represents the most extreme level of financial insecurit y. For context, the federal poverty line is the same across the country - regardless of cost of living - but changes by househo ld size. In 2021, individuals living alone or considered a household of one would fall below the federal poverty level at an inco me level of $12,880, while federal poverty level for a family of four is $26,500. Figure 23 presents data on the percentage of residents falling below the poverty line in the state, county, and town - and zip -code -level. In Hudson County, 14.2% of individuals fall below the poverty line, but it is nearly 20% in Jersey City zip codes 07304, 07305, 07306, and Union City .

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ( SNAP) offers nutrition assistance to certain income -eligible Hudson County residents. From 201 6-2020, 13.9 % of households in Hudson County were receiving SNAP benefits (Figure 25). Of note, Jersey City zip code 07304 had 23.7 % and Union City had 21.6% of households receiving SNAP benefits , compared to 2.3% in Jersey City zip code 07310 . Figure 25.

However, the percentage of children eligible for the traditional free or reduced -price lunch in Hudson County was 63.5% in the 201 9-2020 school year, much higher than the state overall (38.2%) (Figure 26).

In Figure 27, the participant rate for persons, adults, and children receiving TANF was much higher in Hudson County than in New Jersey overall and peaked in April 2022 with a rate of 648.9 people participating in Hudson County per 100,000 population , more than double the rate of New Jersey as a whole .

However, several focus group participants and key informant interviewees mentioned being faced with the dilemma of not earning sufficient income to cover basic expenses, but not qualify ing for public assistance, including housing, food, or health support because they exceeded th e poverty line threshold. In the words of a focus group participant , \"I know I don't 38.2%63.6% New Jersey Apr-20 Hudson County2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 39 qualify for housing ---I make too much money. I checked a few years ago because I live with my mom.\" Another participant elaborated, \"The problem in Jersey City is that the preferred housing is based upon income... The problem becomes not making enough to pay the rent, but then living with her mom, so she makes too much money because n ow they're doing dual income.\" Many residents expressed frustration at losing or not qualifying for benefits because their earnings were too high, yet not being able to buy food and other essentials. Residents suggested that the federal government should change the income eligibility limit and that more opportunities should be provided to con tinue supporting residents as they transition into the workforce. As discussed in the section on Community Strengths and Assets, residents noted that local government had stepped up to address their needs. Food Access and Food Security While many food ac cess barriers are related to income constraints, access may also be more challenging for residents due to geography and transportation challenges. One of the issues highlighted by Hudson County residents was that the quality of the available food varie d a lot by neighborhoo d. Residents noted that some Jersey City neighborhoods were food deserts , and that in others the supermarkets were not affordable. The availability of supermarkets and grocery stores varied a lot by Hudson County area, with Jersey City zi p code 07306 havin g the largest number of supermarkets (61.7 per 100,000 persons) ( Figure 28). More data on food deserts in Appendix F- Additional Data Tables . Figure 28.

Residents mentioned that many families with children , older adults , and those who are housing insecure were struggling to put food, particularly healthy food, on the table. A focus group participant explained the experience of housing insecure families , \"If I'm staying with someone, I may not be able to cook my own food for my kids, as we just have a room, and maybe I have a little microwave that I could use. I don't want to impose on anybody so I get little , you know , pre-cooked meals ... so we don't get in people's way .\" According to data from Feeding America, Map the Meal Gap confirms that food insecurity i s a problem for many residents; Hudson County had a higher percentage of food insecure residents than New Jersey as a whole in 2019 and 2020, and this percentage increased from one year to the next (Figure 29). However, residents also mentioned that food pantries were widely avai lable throughout the city where low-income people could get food and that food vouchers were available to seniors. Participants spoke about the many food distribution efforts that multiple partners, including government agencies, health care institutions, and non -governmental organizations, carried out during the pandemic to mitigate its effects and make sure that residents did not go hungry. Around one in four survey respondents overall, and about one in three Latino respondents, indicated that they relied on food pantries or other food assistance programs in Hudson County (Figure 30). Other indicators of food insecurity are presented in Figure 30. Figure 29.

Racial/ethnic differences between groups noted by lettering next to the bars in the graph. In addition to food affordability an d access, nutrition literacy is important to maintain a healthy diet. Many focus group participants were aware of the association between a healthy diet and good health, including its importance in chroni c disease management. However, some residents percei ved that the main barrier to maintaining a health y diet was lack of education. As one focus group participant mentioned, \"The problem is that people see fast food as a good, cheap option, but it's not hea lthy - not everyone likes fruit and vegetables.\" Survey data does not seem to support this since perception: whereas a majority of survey respondents of all race/ethnicities reported knowing what constituted a healthy diet, fewer reported being able to eat healthy foods on a regular basis (Figure 31), indicating that other factors such as affordability and access may be at play . The discrepancy is most marked among Black and Latino respondents. Further, t he availability of fast-food restaurants offering low-cost ultra-processed high caloric food s in certain neighborhoods contributes to the problem (Figure 32).

Housing Landscape As in past CHNAs, there was consensus among focus group members and interviewees that there is a significant need for affordable housing in Hudson County. Many participants noted that housing costs and high taxes were concerns. The y described how affordable hou sing was scarce for members of their community who needed it, like low -wage earners and fixed income residents, and it is harder for others, such as seniors , veterans, and young families, to remain in the area. In the words of a resident, \"One of my friends... his parents had the house, and then he inherited it, but he ended up moving because the taxes were just too high. And that was someone who had been living in that house since birth. And he's sixty -something y ears old, it's just sad.\" Assessment participants discussed gentrification - the process by which rising housing costs drive out local residents who are replaced by new wealthy residents. As one interviewee described it, \"We can't not mention the housing market, it's a problem overall , but in Jersey the rate of gentrification is increasing rapidly and even those not on the fringe of poverty are experiencing that.\" While participants reported that some new housing is being built, it is not affordabl e for most. One focus g roup participant explained it thus , \"It's not equal. All the buildings they're putting up are all luxury buildings. When you see the word luxury, you know the rent is astronomical. I can't afford it... whereas affordable housing or housing for seniors is ver y limited. There are years long waiting lists. It's like they don't want us to be here anymore, they're just welcoming the rich and affluent....\" Housing co sts have been steadily rising in all areas with easy access to New York City, particularly near the wa terfront , since 9-11, as New Yorkers sought to leave the city, and COVID -19 accelerated it. Housing Instability and Homelessness Inflation and uncontrolled rent increases following COVID -19 exacerbated people's concerns about housing affordability and hou sing stability. With some residents' financial situations being more uncertain or diminishing during the pandemic, there was greater concern that residents might lose their housing, even with the multip le housing eviction moratoriums in place. Overall, 8.8 % of respondents in Hudson C ounty reported that they or an immediate family member had lost their housing during the COVID -19 pandemic; this percentage was higher among Latinos (13.2%). Housing availabi lity was also cited by interviewees as an important ba rrier to break the cycle of violence . Relocation is one of the strategies used to prevent revictimization of community and domestic violence survivors . However, according to violence interrupters, affordable housing options in low -crime neighborhoods are l imited. Several focus group and interview participants mentioned the problem of homelessness in Hudson County communities. Multiple interviewees and focus group participants indicated that the shelters and temporary housing available were insufficient to meet the needs of the population. They considered the paradox of the prolifera tion of luxury rental buildings in some neighborhoods, and abandoned buildings in others , while many people are left without homes. One resident emphasized, \"Shelter, I think we need more shelters for the homeless people we have.\" On January 26, 2021, there were 882 persons experiencing homelessness on a single night in Hudson County. Of those counted, 56.1 % lived in Jersey \"It looks like Jersey City is trying to cater to the affluent instead of the people who grew up here .\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 44 City. Black residents shoulder ed the burden of homelessn ess. Whereas Black residents ma de up 10.3% of the population, and 18. 3% of the population living under the poverty line, they made up 39.1% of the population experiencing homelessness. Participants highlighted three priority action areas to mitigate the housing problem in Hudson County : one was enact ing policies related to rent control ; the other was reducing real estate taxes; and the third was the urgent need to build or set aside more affordable housing units . A Latino participant expressed, \"The gover nor should control the rise of rent prices. These days it can cost $700 for a room in a shared apartment. 10 years ago, an apartment cost $500 -600, but now it can cost $1 ,200.\" Housing quality was another issue that came up in interviews. A few focus group participants commented that s ome of the affordable housing has lead, mold , and asbestos contamination , which can have devastating consequences on residents' health, particularly among children. The problem was aggravated during COVID -19, which interrupted building quality inspections. Housing data illuminate important disparities and reflects the concerns uplifted by residents. Proportionally f ewer Hudson County residents are homeowners compared to New Jersey as a whole. In New Jersey, 6 4.0% of housing un its were owner occupied in 2016 -2020, in contrast to 32.4% in Hudson County ( Figure 33). Home ownership ranged from 12.5% in Jersey City zip code 07310 to 40.6% in Bayonne . Figure 33.

Median monthly housing costs for owner occupied households with a mortgage ranged from $2, 339 in Jersey City zip code 07304 to roughly $7,600 in Hoboken and Jersey City zip codes 07302 and 07310 ( Table 11). Median monthly housing costs for renter occupied households ranged from $1, 247 in Union City to $2, 945 in Jersey City zip code 07310 during the same period , 2015 -2019. Table 11. Monthly Median Housing Costs, by State and County, 2015 -2019 Owner -occupied Renter -occupied $1,247 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 The average percent of income spent on housing costs is an important measure of an area's availability of affordable housing. A larger proportion of New Jersey renters, who tend t o be less wealthy than homeowners, spend over a quarter of their earnings on housing. In New Jersey, 4 6.2% of owner - occupied households with a mortgage and 6 2.2% of all renters reported spending spend more than 25% of their income on housing costs ( Table 12). Disparities in housing cost burden exist within Hudson County . In Jersey City zip codes 07302 and in Hoboken , less than one in three owner -occupied and 44% of renter -occupied households reported high housing costs whereas 64.4% of owner -occupied and 66.5% of renter -occupied residences in Union City reported spending more than 25% of their income on housing costs. Additional housing data can be found in Appendix F- Additional Data Tables . Table 12.

Only 27.8 % of survey respondents agreed or complet ely agreed with the statement that there was enough affordable housing that is safe and well -kept in their community. Agreement was least likely among Black and Latino respondents, where only 11.5% and 19.1%, respectively, agreed/completely agreed with the statement about affordable housing , significantly lower than those of White respondents (36.5%) (Figure 34).

Racial/ethnic differences between groups noted by lettering next to the bars in the graph. Homeowner vacancy rate , which represents the proportion of the homeowner inventory that is vacant for sale, is another indicator of lack of affordability , oftentimes due to homeowners' inability to pay real estate taxes. The homeowner vacancy rate was notably higher in Hudson County (2.1%) over the period of 2016 -2020 compared to New Jersey (1.4%) (Figure 35). Vacan cy rates were particularly elevated in Hoboken (3.5%) and Jersey City zip code 07307 ( 3.0%) over that time. This reality was also reflected in the interviews with residents. In the words of a Black resident, \"Prices have been slowly rising, amazing that th ey have money to build these new buildings but can't help people maintain the property they have here - know people who had to move because taxes were too high.\" 27.8% Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 47 Figure 35. Homeowner Vacancy Rate, by State and County, 2016 -2020 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 Housing and Technology Infrastructure Technology is an important tool to access information, services, and resources for individuals, families, and households. The imp ortance of technology - and the consequences of the digital divide - became even more pressing and evident during the COVID -19 pandemic. The ability to be online, participants noted, is essential for residents to connect to resources for education, employm ent, and other services. Limited technological infrastructure posed an important barrier to learning when public schools moved to online education during COVID -19. Further, given the growth in telehealth, technology is also becoming essential to accessing healthcare. Yet some comm unity residents do not have access to technology \u2014they are unable to afford computers or Internet access, or do not know how to use it. One health care provider described, \"People working online tend to be good with telehealth, but there are many who don't know how to connect, don't have what is needed, it is just as hard to get online as it is to travel. \" In 201 6-2020, about 9 3% percent of Hudson County households had access to a computer ( Figure 36). Households in Jersey City zip code 07306 (90.3%) and Bayonne (90.8%) reported computer access that was below the county -wide percentage ; with about 1 in 10 households reporting having no computer at home , compared to almost every household in Jersey City Jersey City (07304) Jersey City (07305) Jersey City (07306) Jersey City (07307) Jersey City (07310) Union City2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 48 Figure 36. Households with a Computer, by State, County, and Town, 2016 -2020 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 There were similar trends i n household Internet access. Most of the areas that reported a lower percentage of computer access when compared to Hudson County also reported lower levels to the Internet , including Union City (82.5%), and Jersey City zip codes 07304 (84.6%) and 07305 (8 4.7%) (Figure 37).

Transportation Infrastructure Transportation was often mentioned by focus group and intervie w participants as a top asset in Hudson County . Most particip ants did not indicate that they were car dependent; instead, they noted that it was easy to get around. A Latino immigrant said that \"public transportation is very good for people who don't drive; everything is close and accessible.\" Affordabl e and accessi ble public transportation is important to promote equity, as it provides a means to getting to -and-from work, school, and other locations for low - income residents who cannot afford car expenses and to undocumented residents without a driver's license. Residents appreciated the proximity of Hudson County to New York City, as a source of business and economic development in the area. This is facilitated by the multiple public transportation options available to and from New York City. One resident described Jersey City \"as a transportation rich area where there is a lot of income and economic opportunity, even if it is not very well distributed to everyone who lives here.\" Transportation Partnerships In addition to publ ic transportation, several participan ts indicated that partnership between health care and social services institutions and private transportation companies were an asset and facilitated access to health care and other services and programs, particularly for older adults and violence survivor s. While transportation was discussed as a significant asset among focus group and interview participants, survey respondents noted some limit ations of the transportation infrastructure. As shown in Figure 38, only about half of Hudson County survey respondents agreed or completely agreed with the statement, \"My community has transportation services available for seniors and those with disabilities .\" Similarly, slightly over half of survey respondents agreed/compl etely agreed that their community had transportation services to assist residents in getting to doctor 's appointments . There were no statistically significant differences in these responses by race/ethnicity. 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 50 Figure 38.

Data from the U.S. Census confirmed residents' viewpoints regarding transportation . Residents of Hudson County are a lot less car-dependent than those of Jersey City as a whole . In certain areas, such as Hoboken (52.7%) and Jersey City zip code s 07302 (56.7%) and 07310 (61.8%) , well over half of residents relied on public transportation (Figure 39). Hudson County residents were also more likely to walk to work than in the state overall, with over 7% of survey respondents reporting doing so. One focus group participant summed it up, \"Another strength [of Hudson County] is how easy it is to commute everywhere. We have the Via shuttles, Path trains, buses.\" 53.5%49.8% 54.5%52.3% 50.0%53.8% 50.0%47.1% 57.1%50.8% My community has transportation services for seniors and those with disabilitiesMy community has transportation services that assist residents in getting to doctor appointmentsWhite (n=126) (D) Hispanic/ Latino (n=68) (C) Black (n=26) (B) (n=44) (A) Total (n=273)2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 51 Figure 39. Means of Transportation to Work for Workers Aged 16+, by State, County, and Town 2016 - 2020 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 Similar to other factors, owning a private vehicle is no t equally distributed across county residents. Those without a car are usually not home -owners. Across Hudson County, 13.7 % of owner -occupied households and 40.6 % of renter -occupied households did not have access to a personal vehicle in 201 6- 2020 (Table 13); these percentages are much higher than in New Jersey as a whole, possibly denoting the accessibility of public transportation and Jersey City's walkability . Car ownership ranged from 9.8% in Jersey City zip cod e 07305 to 26.0% in Jersey City zip code 07310 among homeowners ; and from 31.5% in Bayonne to 61.2% in Jersey City Jersey City (07304) Jersey City (07305) Jersey City (07306) Jersey City (07307) Jersey City (07310) Union CityCar, truck, or van (alone) Car, truck, or van (carpooled) Public transportation Walked Other means Worked from home2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 52 Table 13.

Urban environments and physical spaces can expose people to toxins or pollutants, affecting health conditions such as cancer, lead poisoning, and ast hma. Physical space can also influence lifestyles. Playgrounds, green spaces, and trails , as well as bike lanes a nd safe sidewalks and crosswalks , all encourage physical activity and social interaction, which can positively affect physical and mental healt h. Residents raised several issues related to the buil t environment. Multiple residents across focus groups expressed their concerns that there were too many new constructions. In their view, overbuilding resulted in overpopulation and shrinkage of green spaces. This issue was summed up by one resident, \"Seein g all of these new buildings that are just being built out of nowhere, blocking the view of the city, being built on green areas, parks. I understand the need to have Jersey City well developed but I think over populating is a concern. Even the smallest em pty area now has a building.\" As mentioned in the Education section, another problem mentioned by residents was that the public school infrastructure in some districts has not kept up with population growth and cannot accommodate the number of school child ren. Other residents mentioned that the older constructions ha d environmental contaminants, including lead and mold, which can have deleterious impact on health (see section on Lead ). Flooding and Em ergency Preparedness Participants remarked that s everal areas of Hudson County , particularly those near the waterfront, are flood prone. A housing expert explained that p reparing the county for future floods and an overall rise in water level was an import ant public health precaution. A key informant interviewee in the housing sector mentioned that several urban redevelopment projects were underway to mitigate possible har m from floods and other natural disasters . The redevelopments would increas e flood sto rage capacity and improv e floodwater absorption . Further, the interviewee noted that new constructions are planned so as to integrate flooding mitigation and water containment measures . Redevelopment s in some area 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 53 include \"new walkways and parks available for all residents \" and building higher off the ground to prevent water damage. Parks and Green Areas Green area coverage is essential to an environment conducive to good health . Green area coverage not only contribute s to air quality and mental and physical health, but it also serve s as an important flood mitigation strategy as soil absorb s water more readily than concrete. Multiple initiatives are under way in Hudson County to improve green areas; one is the Jersey City Urban and Community Forestry to promote planting efforts and urban reforestation. A health official noted the important contribution of the Jersey City Parks Coalition to these efforts . According to the focus group participan t, the coalition is a volunteer -run grassroots organization whi ch has spearheaded green area betterment and maintenance projects and community events , such as plantings , throughout different Jersey City neighborhood s. The participant mentioned that the y are also lead advocates for more funding for green spaces. The co ntributions of the Jersey City Parks Coalition were described by a public health official : \"They have worked with the city to determine a priority list, maste r plan, getting a blanket insurance policy to cover all insurance needs for events for all parks.\" According to the participant, t he coalition reflects the city's diversity and serves as a vehicle to engage different sectors of the population. Different g roups mentioned engaging in various outdoor activities. Veterans remarked on how important being i nvolved in organized team sports was to their physical and mental health; they noted that these recreational opportunities were mainly organized by the city. Latino participants indicated walking was their main exercise and valued having access to well -lit, safe parks in their neighborhood. As with other topics, there was a diversity of experience s regarding the availability of green space. Whereas some reside nts indicated that there were plenty of green areas for outdoor activities near their homes, other s mentioned not having safe parks nearby . In a participant's words, \"The inner, inner cities , I'm not sure about their parks. I have a park luckily down the street, it's a nice large park, it is safe, it's patrolled by police. But if you go up into the Gre enville section , I'm not sure about those parks... it's not as lush and green as Lincoln Park o r Liberty Park.\" These differences were reflected in the community survey . About 70% of Hudson County survey respondents agreed or completely agreed with the stat ement, \"My community has safe outdoor places to walk and play\" ( Figure 40). However, responses significantly differed by race/ethnicity. Asian (59.1%), Black ( 61.5%), and Latino ( 64.7%) survey respondents were much less likely than White respondents (81.0%) to agre e with the statement about safe outdoor space. \"Where to play safely is not available. When Jersey City is described, it's often just the one nice part of the city, and rarely about the other quadrants.\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 54 Figure 40.

Violence Prevention and Safety Violence and trauma have short - and long -term effects on physical and mental health. People can be exposed to violence in many ways: they may be victims and suffer from premature death o r injuries or witness or hear about cri me and violence in their community . Violence and trauma are inextricably linked to the social determinants of health ; people of low socioeconomic status residing in low-resource neighborhoods and schools are at higher risk of experiencing violence. According to an education administrator interviewed , many youths in low -income settings are exposed to domestic and community violence and other adverse childhood experiences , that have a profound impact on their well-being. In 2019, almost two out of every five children in New Jersey had experienced a traumatic event before the age of 18 ( Figure 41). (More localized data not available.) Violence interrupt ion professionals discussed h ow providing a safe and nurturing environment, access to counseling early on to address the symptoms of t rauma, and paths to educational and economic opportunities were key strategies to interrupt ing the cycle of violence. 70.3% 59.1%61.5%64.7%81.0% (ABC) Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 55 Figure 41.

Many indicated being safe in their neighborhoods , while other s reported being nervous about crime, and yet others that violence was a n \"epidemic .\" Residents' s afety concerns were generally related to gun violence , loitering, and substance use by young people . According to survey data and interviewees, p ersons of color, particularly Black residents, shoulder the burden of violent crime. Figure 42 presents survey data on the percent of respondents who agreed or completely agreed with statements related to violence in their community, overall and by race/ethnicity. Overall, 41.4% of Hudson County survey r espondents agreed or completely agreed that vi olence was not prevalent in their community and 34.1 % reported that interpersonal violence was not prevalent in their community. However, responses varied by race/ethnicity , with Black survey respondents being the least likely to agree or completely agree with either of these statements. 61.0% 24.6% 14.4% No ACES 1 ACE 2 or More ACES \"We are very bu sy, being in Jersey City.

Racial/ethnic differences between groups noted by lettering next to the bars in the graph. Gun Injury and Vio lent Crime Quantitative data support residents' varied perceptions of risk . Mortality rate by firearm injury in Jersey City from 2015 -2019 was 5.4 deaths per 100,000 residents, higher than those state -wide (5.1 deaths per 100,000 residents) and in Hudson C ounty (3.5 deaths per 100,000 residen ts). In 20 20, rates of violent crime (i.e. , murder, rape, aggravated assault) in Hudson County (280 per 100,000 residents ) were higher than in New Jersey (195 per 100,000 residents ) and varied widely across the county. Jersey City (432 per 100,000 residents ) had more than double the crime rate than the state average and 35% higher crime rate than the county overall ; Union City 's crime rates were slightly higher than Hudson County's (290 per 100,000 residents), whereas Bayonne's (177 per 100,000 residents) and Hoboken's (120 per 100,000 residents) were lower than the state and county average (Figure 43). Property crime (i.e. , burglary, larceny, and auto theft) is much more common t han violent crime. Property crime in Hudson County was also above the state average (1,338 and 1,158 incidents per 100,000 persons, respectively). Property crime was most common in Union City (1,694 per 100,000 residents), Jersey City (1,457 per 100,000 re sidents ), and Hoboken (1,405 per 100,000 residents ) (Figure 44).

Hate Crimes and Anger It is of note that r esidents perceived a change in a ttitude in the aftermath of COVID -19, which they related to economic and social stressors. Specifically, several residents remarked that people had become less patient and more aggressive since the start of the pandemic . This perception was aggravated by reports of hate crimes motivated by biases against certain groups . As explained by one focus group participant, \"There's an underlying fear, suspicion, you know, not only among African Americans . I mean it wasn't that long ago that we had our own shoot ing up here at a Jewish facility . I think there is a lot of fear in regard to racism and antisemitism.\" Hate crimes were also mentioned as a concern for members of the LGBTQ+ community . A key informant interviewee working with the LGBTQ+ community noted that despite efforts, more action is needed to sensitize police officers , employers, educators, parents, and peer s so as to reduce bullying and harassment , particularly against transgend er youth and children in non -traditional families. 195.4 279.7 176.6 119.8 431.9 290.2 New Jersey City 1,158.2 1,694.1 New Jersey Hoboken Jersey City (citywide) Union City \"It's almost, I don't want to say scary, but after the pandemic , everyone is more angry, everyone wants to argue and fight. \"- Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 58 Violence Interruption Pro grams According to key informant interviewees, Jersey City has robust programs and resources to address and mitigate the impact of violence and trauma. Since 2014, the grassroots organization Anti-Violence Coalition has been actively working as violence in terrupters in the city's South side. As expressed by a coalition member, \"We've been working ... to make an impact on the community, see what the needs are, and lobby or advocate. We've been on the ground occupying corners, conducting surveys, trying to find out the main reasons why people can't be successful in their lives due to issues in the neighborhood that wrap around violence and trauma. \" More recently, t he Jersey City Medical Center created a trauma recovery center, which is a national evidence -based model in treating survivors of violence. Additionally , Project H.U.D.S.O.N. is a Hospital -based Violence Intervention Program, associated with the center , which works with community partners to prevent reinjury and retaliatory action . According to intervie wees, p romising results have been achieved b y reaching survivors at bedside , soon after injury, and provid ing trauma -informed intensive case management an d wraparound services , including support for safe housing and vocational training, in addition to medi cal care and counseling . Systemic Racism and Discrimination Perceptions of racism and discrimination varied in qualitative discussions. Over t discriminat ion due to race /ethnicity or nationality did not often come up . Some participants described witnessing discrimination due to gender and sexual orientation. Focus group and interview participants in multiple conversations brought up issues related to systemic racism and discrimination . With few exceptions, they spoke of pervasive inequities experienced by p eople of different groups . The conversations highlighted issues of intersectionalit y; participants discussed the multiplying effe ct of historical and current discriminat ory practices due to multiple conditions , such as race/ethnicity, gender, immigrant status, and socioeconomic status, among others . Participants noted these issues largely impacted communities of color because of the policies and practices embedded throughout society. Highlights from these discussions that touch upon specific topic areas (e. g., in equality, education, housing , violence prevention ) are also mentioned in other sections of this report. A theme that was discussed in most focus groups and interviews was the pervasiveness of systemic racism. One of the ways that this was noted was in the gentrification of Hudson County. Multiple participants discussed how the high cost of housing and taxes are driving people of color out of Jersey City. Both quantitative and qualitative data indicate that t here are insufficient affordable housin g un its. As a Black resident described, \"A lot of the new constructions are rentals so there would be a reduction of generational wealth. Unless you're earning six figures, it will be a challenge to afford rental units in the future. What is affordable may also not be livable because of gang activity or high crime.\" Residents also noted structural racism in the perennial lack of investment in predominantly Black neighborhoods of Jersey City. They described these areas as having many abandoned buildings in a state of disrepair. Focus group and interview participants acknowledged that there has been much more dialogue about racism and discrimination over the past year. Residents indicated that there were efforts underway in Hudson County to curve at least the mo st over t forms of discrimination. A focus group participant expressed , \"Jersey City has definitely addressed the Asian hate crimes, even when I was on the PATH train there was a sign that was like there's no room for hate here in Chinese as wel l.\" However, other residents described instances of discrimination and mistreatment against them and their relatives due to their immigrant status. As one resident explained, \"I do feel welcome by healthcare providers, but I have experienced going with my parents who are immigrants with heavy accents, and I have experienced miscommunication.\" 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 59 Systemic Discrimination Based on Legal Status A theme that emerged in some of the interviews and focus groups was the plight of undocumented immigrants , who face multiple econ omic and social stressors . According to focus group participants, the community is often persecuted by safety systems and live in fear of deportation. Residents explained that undocumented immigrants do not qualify for many government programs, often fear seeking care, and have limited power to negotiate with employers and landlords for salaries and rent control. As noted by several participants, m any have experienced trauma in their home countries, made worse by unstable conditions . Further, par ticipants r emarked that c hildren of undocumented parents or who themselves are undocumented often experience depression and anxiety, largely product of an uncertain future. According to residents, a pathway to legalize the situation of undocumented immigra nts to ensu re they are afforded all the human rights , many who have been most of their lives in the U.S., is urgently needed to improve their life conditions. Responses also varied by survey respondents. One-quarter of Latino survey respondents indicated that they had ever been personally discriminated against when receiving medical care for their race/ethnicity and 17.6% because of language/speech issues. Asian residents were more likely to report being discriminated against for their culture/religious background (15.9%) and for language/speech issues (22.7%). Percentages for other race/ethnicities was not available due to small sample sizes . Other forms of discrimination were also mentioned in the survey. Among survey respondents, 14.1% reported having ever been dis criminated against because of their age ; 14.0% because of their body size; and 16.9% because of their income level. Systemic Discrimination Based on Gender and Sexual Orientation A theme that emerged fr om the qualitative data was discrimination against the LGBTQ+ population. Members of the LGBTQ+ community reported experiencing discrimination based on gender and/or sexual orientation i n medical , educational, and professional settings. As described in the Employment section, Black trans women discussed en countering discrimination in employment due to their gender identity . An LGBTQ+ advocate emphasized more safe spaces for LGBTQ+ youth are needed in schools to prev ent bullying . Also, more education efforts are needed to sensitize parents, educators, and ot her adults that interact with LQBTQ+ youth to ensure a supportive environment . As noted by an activist, many educators do not have the skills to address the needs of children growing up in non -traditional families. Additional ly, the interviewee discussed h ow programs to sensitize and train police and healthcare providers should also be offered to promote quality, respectful care that fully addresses the diverse needs of this group , particularly of transgender individuals . One in ten survey respondents in Hu dson County reported being discriminated against when receiving medical care because of their gender identity and/or sexual orientation. \"The undocumented a re scared to ask for help, and we are seeing that community getting jumped overnight, not wanting to go to the hospital over what they will get charged. \" - Focus group participant \"A doctor told a lesbian woman seeking gynecological care that she didn't n eed checkups because she didn't have sex with men .\" - Key informant interviewee 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 60 Addressing the Systems of Oppression Quality education is a condition to overcom ing intergenerational poverty resulti ng from historical systems of oppression . However, residents remarked that, despite attempts to provide adequate budget s, and largely because school financing relies partly on local cost share , public schools in low -income neighborhoods of Hudson County are under - resourced . Residents noted that t he high cost of college poses another barrier for youth growing up in poverty . Further, they explained that the employment opportunities for unskilled workers do not pay a livable wage, nor offer a fixed income and benefits. In the words of a resident, \"There are jobs, I think, if you are well educated that you can sustain yourself on. But if you only have a high -school degree, it might be a bigger challenge.\" Interviewees alluded to how historical discriminatory policies against people of color, such as redlining, coupled with disinvestment and lack of educational and employment opportunities are contributing to growing inequalities and driving more people into the low -middle and low class es. Residents mentioned th at some Hudson County municipalities have put in place programs to address the effects of systemic racism, such as first-time homeowner program s for low-income residents , rent control policies , and programs to promote minority and/or woman owned business es. However, participants emphasized that more policies and programs to promote equity and reverse this trend are urgently needed. \"The South side is a beautiful part of town, we've got some issues in some areas because of systemic racism and lack of investment, but it's a beautiful part of town .\" - Key i nformant interviewee 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 61 Community Health Issues Understanding community health issues is a critical step in the CHNA process. The disparities seen i n these issues mirror the historical patterns of structural, economic, and racial inequit ies experienced for generations across the county and the U.S. Community Perceptions of Health Understanding residents' perceptions of health helps provi de insights into lived experiences, including into the key health concerns and facilitators and barriers to addressing health conditions. When asked about top concerns in their community, focus group participants and interviewees identified social and economic issues such as financial and food insecurity , and housing - and how these were associated with ch ronic conditions that affect many members of the community, including high - blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes . Challenges to accessing healthcare, largely due to cost, was also a top concern among residents. Another issue discussed by multiple groups, was the increase in mental health disorders among the entire population, but particularly among youth, seniors, and veterans . Other issues that were mentioned included a rise i n community and domestic violence, an increase in sexually transmitted infections , and challenges to women's health , the latter in the context of the wave of legal decisions that curtail reproductive rights . Survey respondents were pre sented with a list of specific issues and had the ability to add issues not listed. They were asked to mark the top three health concerns or issues for their community. They also were given the option to write in other issues not listed. This feedback comp lements quantitative data concerning health status and conditions. As shown in Figure 45, mental health, overweight/obesity, and high stress lifestyle were the top three issues noted among survey respondents. This was slightly different than results of the same survey in 2019. In that 2019 survey, obesity was the num ber one community health concern selected by survey respondents, followed by diabetes and then (tied) substance use and mental health. While mental hea lth, overweight/obesity, and high stress lifestyle were the top three community health concerns among re spondents in the recent survey, d ifferences appear ed by race/ethnicity. While respondents identifying as Asian, Latino, and White shared the three prior ity health topics describe d above, Black respondents ' top priority area was violence/community safety, followed by mental health issues, and adequate and affordable housing ( Figure 46). \"Diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity in this community is a proble m [among ] people who have a difficult time affording food \"- Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 62 Figure 45.

Leading Causes of Death and Premature Mortality Mortality rates help to measure the burden and impact of disease on a population, while premature mortality data (deaths before age 75 years old) provide a picture of preventable deaths and point to areas wh ere additional health and public health interventions may be warranted. The most current mortality data are available for the period 2018-2020, which includes the first year of the COVID -19 pandemic. The a ge-adjusted mortality rate per 100,000 Hudson County residents was 672.6 in this period ( Figure 47); 7% below the mortalit y rate in New Jersey during the same time period. Figure 47. Age-Adjusted Mortality Rate per 100,000 population, 2 018-2020 DATA SOURCE: New Jersey Department of Health, New Jersey Death Certificate Database, Office of Vital Statistics and Registry, 2018 -2020 722.2672.6 New Jersey Hudson County2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 64 The leading cause of death in Hudson County in 20 20 was heart disease (1 62.9 per 100,000), followed by COVID -19 (226.6 per 100,000) , and cancer ( 111.6 per 100,000 ) (Figure 48). Additional leading causes of death include d unintentional injury ( such as unintentional poisonings including drug overdoses, unintentional motor vehicle accidents, unintentional drownings, and falls), stroke, and chronic lower respiratory disease (CLRD - e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma). It is important to note the deleterious impact of COVID -19 on mortality , which bec ame the second cause of death in both the state and the county. The mortality rate by COVID - 19 in Hudson County was 46% higher than in the state . Additional data on unintentional injury can be found in Appendix F- Additional Data Tables . Figure 48.

Obesity, Healthy Eating, and Physical Activity Obesity is the second leading cause of preventable death in the United States and in creases the likelihood of chronic conditions among adul ts and children. Overweight and Obesity As discussed earlier in the Perceptions of Community Health section, obesity was cited as the second top health concern in the community in the survey (after m ental health). However, it was not discussed at length in the focus groups or interviews by participants. Instead, residents from diverse population groups commented on the chronic conditions that are linked to obesity, particularly di abetes , and described how these conditions were prevalent in the community from a very young age . They discussed the social and economic challenges to maintaining a healthy lifestyle , including buying healthy food, access issues in living in a food desert, barriers to seeking medical care, having safe and accessible green space for activity , and time constraints . (See sections related to Food Access and the Built Environment for survey data and surveillance data on perceptions and the landscape related to t he food and physical activity environment.) The latest surveillance data on overweight/obesity is from several years ago. Adults at the state and county level were asked to self -report their height and weight. Based on this self -report, about one in four adults in Hudson County were considered obese, comparable to New Jersey ( Figure 50). In the current community survey for this CHNA, survey respondents were asked to indicate whether they or a household family member were ever told b y a doctor or health professional that t hey had a 408.7 208.6 146.8 Indian/ Native Asian, Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic Hispanic/ Latino White, Non-HispanicNew Jersey Hudson County2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 66 weight problem ( Figure 51). Among these respondents, almost half ( 46.9%) indicated yes, although responses varied by race/ethnicity . Nearly three in four (72.7%) Black respondents reported this, significantly higher than Asian (41.7%) and Latino (41.0%) respondents. Figure 50.

Participants remarked that physical activity was important for maintaining both physical and mental health. A focus group participant explained the importance of exercise for those experiencing mental health problems and to address isolation, \"I wish more veterans would take advantage of opportunities for umpiring and make a little money on the s ide - I do various leagues, swimming, softball, baseball . [There are] a lot of opportunit ies for veterans that are just coming out of a mental health ar ea, whereas they want a different avenue to go to, and be part of the community which a lot of veterans try to isolate ... But this is something where you can just come out and do , be a part of the community with fellow veterans, you know. \" Community survey respondents were asked if they were physically active, and nearly 7 8% indicated y es (Figure 52). However, Black and Latino survey respondents were less likely to say that they were currently physically active, wit h only 6 9.2% and 72.3% saying yes, respectively, a lower proportion when compared to White respondents ( 84.9%). As discussed earlier in this report, Black and Latino survey respondents were also significantly less likely than White respondents to indicate that there were safe outdoor places to walk and play in their community. Community survey respondents who were parents also indicated whether they would describe their children as physically act ive or sedentary after school or on weekends . About 78% of Hudson County parent survey respondents described their children as physically active, with 2 1.8% describing them as sedentary. In comparison, only 53.6% of Latino parents indicated their children were physically active. Data is not available for Asian and Bl ack parents. Figure 52.

These data sou rces collect data on whether respondents had no leisure time activity. Across the state and by county, the percentages of those with no leisure time physical activity were higher in 2018 than in 2014 ( Figure 53). In Hudson County, 29.4 % of adults reported having no leisure time in 2018, compared to 25.3 % in in 2014. Surveillance data from 201 6 to 20 20, by race/ethnicity indicate d that Latino respondents were most likely to report having no leisure physical activity time (32.8%) (Figure 54).

These difficultie s included lack of availability and affordability of healthy foods, depending on food provided by schools or food pantrie s, living in a \"food desert,\" and not having access to a kitchen to cook healthier meals for the family. However, other participants mentioned that there were healthy food outlets available in Hudson County. During COVID -19, multiple participants remarked that the community came together to ensure access to healthy foods to those affected by the pandemic via food drives and delivery of healthy food boxes or supermarket gift cards. Residents also noted that low-income seniors could receive food vouchers . In addition, Jersey City Medical Center has a healthy food pantry which serves people facing food insecurity, many of whom are seniors. Current surveillance data on fruit and vegetable consumption is not available for Hudson County. New Jersey data indicate that 19.1% of New Jersey adults reported in 2017 that they ate vegetables less than one time per day and 33.6% of New Je rsey adults reported eating fruit less than one time per day, according to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey. Eating break fast daily is an important start to a healthy day. However, c urrent data from the CHNA community survey shows differences by race/ethnicity . Among respondents living with a child, o nly about three -quarters of Black and Latino survey respondents (78.6% and 71.4%, respectively) reported that their children eat breakfa st daily, significantly fewer than White respondents (97.6%) who se children did so ( Figure 55).

Chronic disease s are also a contributing factor to poor mental health . As a healthcare provider noted, \"There's a lot of depression surrounding getting diagnosed with one of those [chronic] illnesses. They have access to those programs, but they feel beaten down because of misinformation. When they get more information, they feel that they can manage it. The diagnosis can feel like a death sentence sometimes. \" Although chronic diseases are among the most common and cos tly health problems, they are also among the most preventable through changes in behavior such as reduced use of tobacco and alcohol and improv ed diet and physical activity. The following section describes the health data (e.g., screening, incidence, morta lity, etc.) related to chronic conditions. High Cholesterol and High Blood Pressure Multiple focus group and interview participants mentioned high cholesterol and hypertension as prevalent in the community , including among children. High cholesterol and h igh blood pressure are significant risk factors for heart disease, stroke, and other chronic diseases.29 Community survey respondents in spring/summer 2021 were asked about their participation in different types of health screenings over the past two years (Figure 56). Many respondents (70.0%) in Hudson County indicated that they have received a cholesterol screening, and 86.4% had participated in a blood pressure screening. Black respondents were significantly more likely than Asian , Latino , and White respondents to indicate that they had participated in either type of screening over the past two years. Figure 56.

Approximately 71% and 77% of Hudson County survey respondents indicated that they or member of their family had been told by a health professional that they have high cholesterol and blood pressure , respectively (Figure 57). Black respondents, with the highe st rates of both, were significantly m ore likely than Asian , Latino, or Black respondents to indicate that they or a family member ha d high cholesterol or high blood pressure.

Heart Disease While focus group and interview participants did not directly discuss heart disease, it is the leading cause of death in Hudson County , and closely associated with other conditions mentioned by resident s such as diabetes, high cholesterol, and lifestyle . In the following graph, surveillance data are presented on the number of adults visiting the emergency department for major cardiovascular disease . In 2016 -2020, the rate of heart disease emergency department (ED) visits per 10,000 population in Hudson Cou nty was 169.6 visits and the rate of heart disease hospitalizations per 10,000 population was 256.3 , similar to state rates ( (C) White (n=61) (D) Total Asian (n=27) (A) (n=15) (B) Hispanic/ Latino White (n=66) (D)High Cholesterol High Blood Pressure2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 72 Figure 58.

Across the state, the overall mortality per 100,000 was 162. 8 and was highest among Black (194 per 100,000) and White (17 2 per 100,000) residents, as well as male (206.7 per 100,000) residents (Figure 60). At the county level, the overall cardiovascular disease mortality per 100,000 was 147, lower t han in the state. Like New Jersey, mortality was highest among Black (194 per 100,000) and White (187 per 100,000) , as well as male (189 per 100,000) residents . Figure 60.

Participants indicated observing an increase in rates of diabetes in recent years and noted that diabetes was highly prevalent in their communities, starting at a young age. A Latino focus group participant described it as, \"Everyone, even children , has diabetes ... What is in the air for everyone to have diabetes?\" Focus group participants attributed the increase in diabetes rates to stress associated with social and economic factors , such as affor dable healthy living and access to good healthcare. As one focus group participant stated, \"Diabetes is a very expensive issue in the community, and we'll often see people forgo their medication because they can't afford it or forgo healthy fo ods because t hey can't afford it .\" A theme that emerged strongly from participants was the urgent need to address the upstream causes of disease to reduce the incidence of diabetes and other chronic disease among low -income communities and persons of Male FemaleRace/Ethnicity GenderNew Jersey Hudson County2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 74 The follow ing figure shows the percent of adults that reported a diagnosis of diabetes overall and by race/ethnicity from 2016 to 20 20, the most recent that surveillance data is available. In New Jersey, 9.2% of adults reported a diabetes diagnosis. This p ercentage was highest among Black, Non -Hispanics (1 4.7%), followed by Asian, Non -Hispanics (12.1%) and Hispanic/Latino (12. 4%), and lowest among White, Non - Hispanics (6.7%) ( Figure 61). A higher percentage of adults were dia gnosed with diabetes in Hudson County (11.5%). Of note, whereas county rates among Black (14.1%) and White (6.9%) residents were comparable to those of the state , Latinos in Hudson County (13.5%) had higher rates and Asians had much lower rates (0.7%) than in New Jersey.

However, cancer incid ence and mortality are close ly associated with the social determinants of health. Screening and early detection is a critical strategy to reduce premature deaths and is strongly li nked to access to care. Further, lifestyle factors are the most significant risks of developing cancer . Exposure to carcinogens in the built environment , the water, the air, and the soil, because of daily activities at home , school , and the workplace , increases the risk of developing cancer . In addition, a healthy lifestyle - main taining a healthy diet and weight, and not smoking or consum ing alcohol, are preventative factors ; as discussed in other sections of the report, some population groups face substantial barriers to sustaining a healthy lifestyle. 9.2%11.5%12.4% 0.7%14.7%14.1% 12.4%13.5% 6.7% 6.9% New Jersey Hudson CountyOverall Asian, Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic Hispanic/Latino White, Non-Hispanic \"We seem taken aback by how prevalent these chronic diseases are so much so that when somebody's first diagnosed , many times they don't even react to it like, \"Yeah , well, my father had it , my mother had it, my friends have it , and now I have it .\" It's normalized and I think that's a shame .

Across the state, the overall mortality per 100,000 was 1 41.1 and was highest among Black, Non -Hispanics (16 1.5 per 100,000) and White , Non-Hispanics (15 0.6 per 100,000) (Figure 62). The overall cancer mortality rate in Hudson County (121.1 per 100,000) was lower than in the state . Most racial/ethnic groups in Hudson County, had cancer mortality rate s comparable to those in New Jersey . However, Black residents' cancer mortality rate (182.9 per 100,000) in Hudson County , was higher than in New Jersey. Appendix I in the back of this report contains additional cancer data including incidence and mortality data and five -year trends for all cancers across New Jersey and Hudson Count y.

Hudson County had a rate of 3,477 ED visits, a rat e higher than the state , and 925 hospitalizations per 10,000 population , slightly below the state - wide rate. DATA SOURCE: New Jersey Department of Health, Office of Health Care Quality Assessment, New Jersey Data Collection System, as reported by New Jer sey State Health Assessment D ata (NJSHAD), 2016 -2020 Disability Residents who have some type of disability may have difficu lty getting around, living independently, or completing self-care activities. Other disabilities, such as hearing impairment, visio n impairment, and cognitive impairment, may also impact residents ' daily lives. Disabilities affect people of all ages and are most prevalent among older adults. While the issue of disabilities did not emerge often in the qualitative interviews , many peo ple with disabilities face economic instability as they rely on government financial assistance programs for their basic need s. In New Jersey, the Divisions of Developmental Disabilities (DDD) and Disability Services' (DDS) provide support for individuals until they turn 21, and after individuals reach age 60, they can access resources from the Office of Aging and Disability. In addition, it is often challenging for parents of children with disabilities to navigate the education and healthcare system , parti cularly if they have limited English abilities . Even obtaining a diagnosis may be difficult . For middle and low -income residents, affording care for children with disabilities is also a barrier.

At the county level, 3. 7% of children under 18 years old, 6.4% of 18-to-64-year -old adults, and 32.9% of adults 65 years of age and ol der had a disability in Hudson County. Bayonne had the highest proportion of children living with a disability (5.8% ) in 2016 -2020 ; in Jersey City zip code 07304, almost 1 in 10 adults aged 18 -64 had a disability (9.1%); and in Union City more than 2 in 5 (40.7%) adults 65 and older were living with a disabili ty.

In the field, mental health and substance use are typically discussed under the larger framework of behavioral hea lth. Mental Health Mental health was identified as a top community health concern. The topic of mental health arose in almost all conversations conducted for this CHNA. Interviewees and focus group members noted that while mental health has been a longstanding health concern, the COVID -19 pandemic has made the issue more pressin g. In the words of a Latino focus group participant, \"The pandemic had an adverse effect on everyone \u2014children, teens, and adults \u2014and there have been many people affected psychologically.\" Job loss and economic pressures, virtual schooling, social i solation , and the uncertainty associated with the pandemic were all cited as contributors to increased stress, depression, and trauma among Hudson County residents. At the same time, gun violence has also taken a toll on individual and collective psyches . In addit ion, poor mental health is often co -morbid with chronic conditions, which are highly prevalent in the population. Among community survey respondents, mental health was the top community health issue with 3 0.9% of respondents identifying it as an ar ea of concern, as noted previously in the Perceptions of Community Health section. Stigma and Access to M ental Health Care While mental health issues affected people of all ages, races, and genders, mental health for veterans , unhoused individuals, child ren and youth, seniors, trans persons, Latino residents, immigrants, and low - income adults were highlighted in the qualitative discussions. Focus group participants noted that anxiety and depression were prevalent in the community and mentioned several bar riers to care. Participants highlighted stigma associated with mental health as a hindrance . Participants observed that many people affected by mental health did not recogniz e mental health as a medical condition, and this was particularly so among the for eign -born population , veterans , and Black residents . As a focus group participant and veteran described, \"We find that to be a problem, that our veterans don't ask for help, because they're so darn self-sufficient and a little stubborn.\" A key informant interview ee who self - identified as Black explained that for \"those of African descent, counseling was not something that we did.\" Mental Health and Economic Instability Poor mental health is closely associated with economic and housing instability , as desc ribed in the section on Employment . Focus group veteran participants expressed that not having employment that afforded them a living wage was a major cause of anxiety and depression. Latino residents in the focus groups shared stories about the challenges of losing their jobs, paying the rent, and feed ing their families. An advocate for the LGBTQ+ community described high levels of stress and depression among transgender residents due to unemployment. \"The first problem is getting people to recognize the need, it's a national problem, with the advertising that it 's okay to ask for help .\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 85 Mental Health and Trauma Trauma is defined as a perso n's emotional response to a distressing event or series of events, including experiencing or witnessing violence, abuse and neglect in childhood, and war, among others . A person can have a range of psychological and physical symptoms following trauma that can dramatically hinder well-being and daily functioning, and can, in severe case s, develop post -traumatic stress disorder. As described in detail in the section on Violence Prevention and Safety , communit ies of color have experienced an undue burden of multiple forms of intergenerational, childhood, and adult trauma . As noted earlier, violence and community safety was the top health priority for Black survey respondents. Survivors of violence face many barriers to accessing mental health care. Key inform ant interviewees explained that m any trauma survivors come from cultures and environments that stigmatize mental health conditions. Others experi ence economic barriers to accessing care. Focus group participants and interviewees highlighted the urgent need to provide trauma informed care and to expand access to counseling and allied services for persons recovering from trauma in Hudson County . A focus group participant described the dire situation of mothers o f gun violence victims , \"We met with a group of moms whose children were all impacted by gun violence where the child was lost or criminally involved, the moms decided to get together and suppo rt each other. I asked what they did and they said , \"We just gather and wait for the next support victim .\" Thes e women were in trauma themselves, looking to help others but not able to help themselves .\" Since 2020, JCMC's Trauma Recovery Center, a national evidence -based model to treating survivors of violence , has address ed some of the need . The model is based on providing trauma -informed medical care to violence survivors, in addition to counseling to alleviat e trauma symptoms , and linkage to community resources to address survivors' most immediate needs, including relocation, employment, and housing support, amo ng others. Mental Health and the COVID -19 Pandemic The COVID -19 pandemic had devastating consequences on mental health across many sectors of the population. The pandemic contributed to anxiety, depression, and stress. Partly due to fear of the virus and uncertainty , partly due to the financial impact, and partly due to isolation. Further, many community members lost loved ones due to COVID -19. I nterviewees who work ed with seniors talked about isolation and loneliness among older residents, which was har der during the pandemic when senior centers and other social outlets closed . Many residents noted that children and youth were particularly affected as schools closed and they were isolated from their friends and social environment. They indicated that thi s was compounded by parents' increased stress levels due to uncertainty and financial worries. Participants mentioned that y outh exposed to domestic violence were particularly affected by stay-at-home orders. Suicide ideation among teenagers was mentioned by sev eral participants. A public health official summed up the situation of young people during the pandemic, \"They weren't in school through the whole pandemic and, you know, perhaps they're at home with an alcoholic father, or abusive mother, or you know, or no one at all. I think the kids are suffering probably the most as a community.\" \"We need more services because people are not getting the help they need ...\" - Focus gr oup participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 86 Those working in the health sector talked about the mental health of their staff who have faced tremendous pressure when responding to the pandemic . As an interviewe e from public health described, \"[Mental health] is a problem, I think , especially after Covid ... We were all, you know, as a community , at home . Even me , I wasn't at work , but I was working from home you know, 24 /7, 7 days a week . So, I definitely think mental health is a big issue. .. You have to understand what it is to be doing that all the time .\" Reiterating the impact of the pandemic on mental health, 43.9% of survey respondents reported that they or someone in their family ha d personally experienced diffi culty with maintaining a good mental state, while 3 5.1% reported being lonely or isolated from others since COVID -19 began ( Figure 77). More than half of Latino respondents (55.9%) reported that they or a family me mber had difficulty maintaining a good mental state during COVID -19, significantly more than Black (26.9%) and White (48.0%) respondents. Black respondents (23.1%) were the least likely of all race/ethnic groups to report being isolated. Figure 77.

The overall county rate was slightly higher than at state level (63.1 per 100,000 in Hudson County vs. 60.8 per 100,000 in New Jersey ) (Figure 80). The mental health -related hospitalization rate was highest among the Black population in both the state (94.6 per 100,000) and the county (107.1 per 100,000) , followed by White residents (6 1.5 per 100 ,000 in New Jersey and 66.9 per 100,000 in Hudson County ). County -level rates for mental health hospitalization of Latino and Asian residents were both lower in Hudson County than in New Jersey . Figure 80.

Rates among Asians were lower in the county than in the state , but higher among the other racial/ethnic groups . White residents had the highest suicide rate s in the county (10.5 per 100,000), nearly double those of Black (5.9 per 100,000) and Latino (5.2 per 100,000) residents (Figure 81). Figure 81.

Pediatric mental health -related hospitalization rates in Hudson County were more than double among Black children (34.7 per 100,000) compared to the following group, White children (16.3 per 100,000 ) (Figure 82).

First, even for residents who do seek help, they are not aware of where to obtain it. Second, participants noted that there were i nsufficient mental health service providers in H udson County to meet the demand , particularly those that can provide culturally competent services to the diverse population, including gender non-binary people, non -English speakers, and veterans. This leads to long waiting times. As described by a focus group participant, \"From the behavioral health side, due to staff shortages and high demand, we've had to limit community referrals and take from within the hospital to treat the most acute clients. Those others who need mental health support, we don't hav e the bandwidth to help them right now.\" A health administrator described the e fforts made to hire culturally competent staff , \"Not only is it hard finding behavioral health staff, but we also try t o mirror the staff we hire, bilingual staff are unicorns b ecause they are hard to find. Matching makeup of the staff, specifically behavioral health, is challenging.\" 27.625.2 7.9*37.434.7 18.2 7.127.4 16.3 New Jersey Hudson CountyOverall Asian, Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic Hispanic/Latino White, Non-Hispanic \"[It] has been very difficult for our patients to access behavioral health services ... we have an extensive waiting list. At any given time to get an appointment with us can take 4 to 6 months, so we've tried as much as we can to reach out to all of our partners ...\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 90 To facilitate referrals, during COVID -19, the Health Department consolidated a mental health directory , including the suicide prevention hotlines , available at: https://healthierjc.com/mental -health/ . JCMC and other providers began offering services via telehealth to expand access during the pandemic. However, whereas this strategy worked with certain groups, others without access to technology or with lower digital literacy, did not benefit . Participants mentioned that s chools often identify and connect students to mental health services, but school nurse and student support/counseling offices are understaffed. As one public school administrator ex pressed , \"We've been trying through the schools with our resources to really embed more social, emotional, not just the mental health, but before it gets to the mental health , helping students overcome challenges , developing resilience , by b eing able to sp eak about their emotions .\" However, staffing is limited , as are the mental health services that schools can provide. Data are presented on the ratio of population to mental health providers in 2019. At the state level, there were 450 people for every men tal health provider ( Figure 83). In Hudson County, the ratio was 1570 people for every mental health provider. The dearth of mental health providers in Hudson County likely worsened during the pandemic. Figure 83. Ratio of Population to Mental Health Providers, by State and County, 2019 DATA SOURCE: National Provider Identification Registry, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, as reported by County Health Rankings, University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2019 Substance Use Substance use was mentioned as a community health concern in conversation s this year, as it was in prior CHNAs. Problem s ubstance use was described as affecting all groups, across all socioeconomic levels . However, i t was mentioned specifically in conversations in the context of unhoused individuals, veterans, and young people ; some reported that problem substance u se is more hidden among youth in higher income communi ties. Several participants reported that substance use, particularly alcohol and opioid use, has increased as a result of economic and social stressors . Further, overdose deaths among young people were also noted as a health concern. A healthcare pr ovider remarked , \"I'll say for us the top conditions that we tend to get a lot of are readmissions for drug s overdose , heroin, opioids, and alcohol . And it's always the same people who keep coming a nd coming .\" Some participants mentioned substance use associated with safety concerns, particularly among youth who consume substances. A Latino resident provided the following example , \"When I wait for the bus, there are young people doing drugs or drinking alcohol nearby and that scares me a lot .\" Data for prevalence of substance use , substance -use related mortality, and substance use treatment is presented in the sections below. 450:11570 :1 New Jersey Hudson County2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 91 Alcohol Use Focus group and interview participants discussed that they were concerned about alcohol consumption as a problem in the communit y, particularly given difficulty accessing long -term treatment services . Alcohol use is also a contributing factor t o other prevalent health conditions, including cardiovascular disease, depression , and violence . Data aggregated for 201 7 to 2020 show binge drinking levels - defined as a drinking pattern that brings blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 percent or higher , typically by consuming four or more drinks (female), or five or more drinks (male) in a two-hour period - for the state and county and by race/ethnicity. In New Jersey, 16. 9% of adults reported binge drinking. This percentage was highest among White (20.5%), followed by Latino (16.1%), Black (12. 6%), and Asian (8.8%) residents (Figure 84). At the county level, 1 7.6% of adults in Hudson County reported binge drinking, with the highest percentage among White (27.2%) residents , followed by Latino (15.8%), Black (11.9%), and Asian (8.1%) residents . Of driving deaths over the period 2015 -2019, 22.8% wer e due to drinking under the influence of alcohol in New Jersey, and 18.1% in Hudson County. Figure 84.

Others expressed concern about the long -term implication s of marijuana legalization on substance use trends in the community. The following figure shows the age -adjusted drug poisoning mortality rate per 100,000 population in 2016 and 20 20. In New Jersey, the age -adjusted rate per 100,000 was 23.2 in 201 6 and 32. 1 in 20 20 (Figure 86). The Hudson County rates were lower than the state, wi th mortality rates per 100,000 at 14.0 in 201 6 and 21.6 in 20 20. Similar trends are also presented in Figure 87 for unintentional drug induced poisoning mortality per 100,000. Figure 86.

When looking at the percentage of adults who are current smokers, Figure 89 show s that in New Jersey, 1 1.8% of adults were current smok ers in 2017 -2020 . This percentage was highest among Black (14.4%) and Latino (14.2%) residents , followed by White (12.0%) and Asian (6.8%) residents . At the county level, 14.2% of residents reported currently smoking overall. Proportionally , more Black residents reported smoking (22.5%) compared to Latino (13.6%), Whit e (13.5%), and Asian (8.1%) adults in Hudson County . Of note, the proportion of Blac k Hudson County residents who smoked was markedly higher than the county average and of Black smokers in the state. Figure 89.

Participants advocated for more local program s, including community -based recovery programs. Several participants mentioned the problem of relapse due to inadequate treatment programs. The disruption in mental health services due to the COVID -19 pandemic further increased the risk of relapse. As a h ealth administrator noted, \"We can detox folks here, but we can't provide addictions treatment. We can detox people over and over again, and we do, that happens in substance abuse treatments, but not ha ving a better solution to move from detox into a 21 -day program or something similar is a problem we've seen for years ... we need a seamless transition between \" the facilities, short -term, and long -term treatment programs . The following figure shows the percentage of substance use treatment admissions by prim ary drug in 2020. At the state level, 4 2.0% of admissions were for heroin, 31.0% for alcohol, and under 10% each for marijuana, cocaine, other opiates, and other drugs ( Figure 90). In the Hudson County treatment si tes, 39.0% of admissions were for heroin, 26.0% for alcohol, 1 9.0% for marijuana, and under 10% each for other opiates, cocaine, and other drugs. Figure 90.

Environmental factors are various and far reaching and include exposure for hazardous substances in the air, water, soil, or food; natural disasters and climate change; and the built environment. Asthma Asthma in children was one of the conditions mentioned in the focus groups and interviews as a community problem and as a major cause of missed school days . Public hea lth data typically show that 1 in 13 adults has asthma , and it disproportionately affects low -income communities and communities of color.30 Perceptions of asthma as a community problem are supported by quantitative data. Data are presented on the rate of asthma hospitalizations per 100,000 population in 20 20. The following figure shows that the age-adjusted rate was 1 ,064 per 100,000 persons in New Jersey and 80 2 per 100,000 persons in Hudson County (Figure 92). 30 https://www.aafa.org/asthma -facts/ 23.0%27.0% Other, Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 96 DATA SOURCE: DATA SOURCE: New Jersey Discharge Data Collection System, Office of Health Care Quality Assessment, New Jersey Department of Health, New Jersey State Health Assessment Data (NJSHAD), 2018 and 2020 NOTE: Includes all asthma diagnoses, including primary, secondary, and other diagnoses.

At state and county levels , Black residents shared a disproportionate burden of asthma ED visits. State -wide, Black, Non -Hispanics had the highest rate of ED visits (89.0 per 10,000), followed by Hispanics/Latinos (32.3 per 10,000), White, Non -Hispanics (13.1 per 10,000), and Asian, Non -Hispanics (3.5 per 10,000 ). Trends in Hudson County were similar to those state -wide, albeit slightly lower for all race/ethnicities. The highest rate in Hudson Cou nty was among Black, Non -Hispanics (7 3.0 per 10,000), followed by Hispanics/Latinos (17.1 per 10,000), White, Non -Hispanics (11.4 per 10,000), and Asian, Non -Hispanics (3.3 per 10,000).

This is a decrease compared to ozone air quality from 2014 -2019 ; however, it is a possibility that COVID -19 impacted these rates as more people spent time indoors and less time traveling ( Figure 95). Data on air quality show a n average daily density of fine particulate of 9.3 micrograms per cubic meter in Hudson County, slightly higher than the state average (8.1) (Figure 96).

Exposure to lead among young children, through touching lead dust or paint chips, for example, can harm children's health, including potential damage to the brain and nervous system, slowed growth and development, and hearing and speech problems. As shown in Figure 97, most of the housin g in Hudson County (68.4 %) was built prior to 1980 , which is a slightly higher percentage than in New Jersey (65.7%) . In 2022 , New Jersey released new state regulations mandating visual inspections of all rental units built prior to 1 978; however, a public health official noted the challenge of implementing such regulations given the number of older housing and the available human resources.

COVID -19 COVID -19 was not extensively discussed in conversations around infectious and communicable diseases. When it was addressed, focus group and interview participants primarily discussed how COVID -19 and the shutdown of businesses and schools had exacerbated the social and economic inequities that already existed. Participants noted that i ncome loss during COVID-19, coupled with inflation , was a major source of stress, anxiety, depression, and other mental hea lth issues. Parents of school children also had to face the challenges of remote schooling , and participants talked about the increase in mental health d isorders among children due to isolation. Participants associated the stress -related to COVID -19 on an increase in domestic violence cases. The socioeconomic impacts of COVID -19 were discussed extensively in prior sections (see , for example, the Inequality, Education, Employment and Workforce , and Income and Financial Security sections ). Additionally, many in the healthcare fields noted a significant disruption in access to services, particularly in preventive care. They remarked that patients we re afraid of seeking care and only did so for emergencies. Several focus group participants observed that COVID -19 had become normalized and were worried that people were not taking the proper precautions, such as masking, to prevent the spread of COVID -19. In terms of COVID -19 testing, there were diverse experiences; whereas some kn ew of free COVID -19 testing sites, others did not. For the latter, cost was a barrier to COVID -19 testing. Since April 2020 until September 2022 , there have been 2.3 million confirmed cases of COVID -19 in New Jersey and nearly 1 90,000 in Hudson County. Cases have fluctuated from January 2 020 throughout 2022; notable peaks in cases per day across New Jersey include April 5, 2020 (>4,000 cases), January 4 , 2021 (>6,700 cases), and December 27 , 2021 ( >43,000 cases). Below, Figure 99 shows new confirme d cases per day per 100,000 population on the first of the month from March 202 2 through August 202 2. \"[COVID impacted] housing, food insecurity, jobs, people have a fear of going back to work, and childcare , because there was a time when everything was virtual, how can parents afford to stay home and put food on the table ?\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 101 Figure 99. New COVID -19 Cases per 100,000 pop ulation, by State and County, 2022 DATA SOURCE: New Jersey Department of Public H ealth, COVID -19 Dashboard, 202 2 According to data from the New Jersey Department of Public Health, a s of August 10, 2022, there were 31,27 5 deaths from COVID -19 in New Jersey and 2,546 in Hudson County. There are racial/ethnic disparities among COVID -19 d eaths in New Jersey. While Black residents ma de up 12.4 % of the New Jersey population, they accounted for 1 6.6% of COVID -19 deaths in the state (Figure 100). Of note, 59.8 % of COVID -19 deaths occurred among White r esidents, even though they only make up 51. 9% of the population. This could potentially be due to the large numbers of White residents aged 65 and older, compared to other racial/ethnic groups . Figure 100. COVID -19 Confirmed Death s, by Race/Ethnicity, by State, 2022 DATA SOURCE: New Jersey Department of Public Health, COVID -19 Dashboard, updated 8/29/2022 As of July 2 7, 202 2, about 6.8 million individuals in New Jersey ha d been fully vaccinated, representing around 76.5 % of the population ; Hudson County had reported over half a million fully vaccinated individuals , which is about 80.8 % of the population (Table 14).

Many participants also expressed concerns about shrinking reproductive rights with the recent overturn of Roe vs. Wade, and the negative impact that would have on women's health , particularly in terms of the inequitable burden o n low -income women . Partici pants reported increase s in incident HIV/AIDS cases during the pandemic and decreases in linkage to care for those persons living with HIV/AIDS. In addition, participants noted that the incidence of other ST Is, such as syphilis, had also increased since th e pandemic . Limited knowledge related to free testing sites in the population was mentioned as a barrier to timely diagnosis and management. In addition, the cost of treatment , even for insured patients, was brought up as a challenge for middle -low and low -income residents. Another concern raised by participants was the increase in ST Is among young people. As part of the discussion, participants cited parents' lack of awareness of the problem, including in affluent neighborhoods as a main barrier to prevention . Participants raised the absence of comprehensive sexual ity education in schools as another impediment to safe sex . According to participants, comprehensive sexuality education provides critical information on hea lthy sexuality and reproduction and serves to empower adolescents to make choices regarding their health . As residents noted, access to information is of utmost importance in the current climate of curtailing legal prote ctions to reproductive choice . HIV transmission data was not available for the county but for the state overall. The rate of HIV transmission for Black residents in New Jersey was 30.2 per 100,000 persons, which was ten times the rate of transmission for White residents ( 3.1 per 100,000) a nd over three times the rate for all New Jersey residents ( 9.9 per 100,000) ( Figure 102). Hispanic/Latino residents had a n HIV transmission rate of 18.4 per 100,00 persons, almost two times greater than that of N ew Jersey residents. \"One thing we have to prevent HIV is PrEP, but we don't know if everyone knows we have it, or where to get tested for free, or even if they should get tested ...

In 20 21, there were 2,610 cases of Chlamydia per 100,000 population in New Jersey among females aged 15 -24, and the case rate was greater for Hudson County ( 2,918 per 100,000 ) (Figure 103). Hudson County reported similar levels of Gonorrhea among people under age 35 , (213 per 100,000) and Hepatitis B ( 63 per 1000,000) compare d to New Jersey overall ( 210 and 62 persons per 100,000 persons , respectively). Figure 104 confirms participants' observations on STI incidence during the pandemic , showing an increase in Syphilis infection rates from 5.3 to 9.8 per 100,000 between 2016 and 2021 in New Jersey, and from 15.4 to 16.5 per 100,000 in Hudson County over the same peri od.

Crude rate. Maternal and Infant Health The health and well -being of mothers, infants, and children are important indicators of community health . Maternal and infant health indicators are considered markers of inequit y as most maternal and perinatal health complications are preventable with access to quality, adequate timely care. Whereas participants did not discuss issues related to maternity and newborn care, they did bring up multiple barriers to accessing care , which may have impeded or severely reduced access to thi s life saving intervention. 2609.5 209.662.12918.0 212.862.7 Chlamydia (females ages 15-24) Gonorrhea (under age 35) Hepatitis C (Acute & Chronic), 2020New Jersey Hudson County 5.39.815.416.5 2016 2021New Jersey Hudson County2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 106 Prenatal Care Prenatal care is an evidenced -based intervention to improve maternal and perinatal health outcomes. Statewide, nearly three in four births had prenatal care within the first trimester ( Figure 105). By race/ethnicity, White, Non -Hispanics (8 2.2%) had the highest percent receiving prenatal care, followed by Asian, Non -Hispanics ( 81.1%), Hispanics/Latinos (6 5.6%), and Black, Non -Hispanic s (60.2%). In Hudson County, 73.9 % of births received prenatal care in the first trimester. Similar to statewide trends, Hispanics/Latinos (6 8.4%) and Black, Non -Hispanics (6 1.2%) in Hudson County had the lowest access to prenatal care . Additional data on access to prenatal care are presented in Figure 131 in the Appendix. Figure 105.

Across New Jersey, 8.0% of births were low birthweight (weighing less than 2,500 grams) ( Figure 106). In New Jersey, Black, Non -Hispanics ha d the greatest proportion of low weight births (12. 6%), followed by Asian, Non -Hispanics (9. 0%), Hispanics/Latinos (7. 5%), and White, Non -Hispanics (6. 4%). Similarly, in 2020, 8.3% of births in Hudson County were low birthweight births , with Black, Non -Hispanics having the highest proportion of low birthweight births (1 3.0%). In Hudson County, 1.2% of births were very low birthweight (<1,500 grams) , with Black, Non -Hispanics (3.0%) having more than double the proportion of very low birthweight births , followed by Hispanics (1.6%) (See Figure 130 Non-Hispanic Hispanic/Latino White, Non-Hispanic2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 107 Figure 106.

Thus, it is a marker of health disparities. Across the state, the maternal mortality rate was 0.5 deaths per 100,000 popul ation from 2015 to 2019 ( Figure 108). In line with other measures of infant and maternal health, Black, Non -Hispanics had the highest maternal mortality rate (1.2 deaths per 100,000), more than double the state -wide rate, with other racial/ethnic groups closer to the state -wide average. Two factors may have exacerbated disparities in maternal deaths in recent years : the COVID -19 pandemic , which is associated with an increased risk of maternal morbidity and mortality, and which disproportionately affected Black residents and curtailed access to safe abortion care .

The infant mortality rate among Black infants (9.3 per 1,000 births) was double to the st ate-wide rate (4.3 per 1,000 births) ( Table 15). Similarly, the infant mortality rate among Black infants (7.1 per 1,000 births) in Hudson County was 2.5 times the county rate (2.9 per 1,000 births) over the same p eriod . Table 15.

It has long -term social and economic consequences, as often, pregnant teens drop out of school, curtailing future opportunities for education and employment, and perpetuating the cycle of poverty. While teen pregnancy was not discussed at length during the assessment conversations, p articipants did talk about how legal challenges an d restrictions to safe abortion and post -abortion care may severely curtail teen's ability to make reproductive choices. Data from the New Jersey Birth Certificate Database show the number of teen births per 1,000 female population fro m 201 4 to 20 20, by r ace/ethnicity. At the state level, the overall teen birth rate was 10.9 per 1,000 and the highest teen birth rate was among Hispanics/Latinos ( 25.0 per 1,000), followed by Black, Non -Hispanics (1 9.7 per 1,000). In Hudson County , the ove rall teen birth rate was higher than the state, 17 .2 per 1, 000 ( Figure 109).

Access to healthcare services is important for promoting and maintaining health, preventing and managing disease, and reducing the chance of premature death. Access and Utilization of Preventive Services, Including Immunizations Participants in the healthcare field unanimously noted a decline in access to preventive care in Hudson County during the pandemic . Some focus group and interview participants discussed delaying care, particularly routine preventive services, in recent years . Reasons cited included the high cost of care , being uninsured, not having sick leave, not having providers that spoke their lang uage, and/or not having childcare available. On the other hand, participants indicated that having a primary care provider and/ or access to a trusted FQHC were two factors that facilitated access to care. The community survey fielded in spring/summer 202 1 asked respondents about their participatio n in various healthcare screenings, including preventive services , in the past two years . Approximately 77% of Hudson County survey respondents reported receiving an annual physical exam ; 73% a vision screening; 68% a dental screening ; and approximately 7 4% a flu shot in the past two years. Fewer - 31% - reported having a hearing screening. Figure 110 presents these data for all Hudson County survey respondents and by race/ethnicity. \"Primary care is a big issue for [most ] of our children who have free and reduced meals .

These patterns were confirmed by surveillance data. Among children in Hudson County, surveill ance data from 2017 -2018 indicate nearly 96% of children were fully immunized (Figure 111). However, 2019 data indicate that only 38 % of Fee- for-Service (FFS) Medicare enrollees reported having received an annua l flu vaccination in Hudson County, compared to 51% in New Jersey overall ( Figure 112). Further, only one in five (20.4%) of eligible Hudson County residents reported receiving a pneumonia vaccine in 2020 (Figure 113). Given the disruption of COVID -19 on access to care, current percentages may be lower. Figure 111.

High healthc are cost was the top barrier mentioned by residents , providers, and healthcare administrators . Other barriers identified through discussions were lack of insurance and/or insurance challe nges, scheduling convenience, long wait times, provider availability, stigma and discrimination, and language and cultural barriers. In addition, fear of institutions due to the increase in anti-immigrant discourse and persecution of undocumented individuals was cited as a major impediment for care access among this populat ion. Many r esidents indicated that they only sought care from hospitals in an emergency; high and unpredictable cost of hospital care, trust, and unavailability of bilingual providers were some of the issues that made residents prefer to seek care from com munity -based clinics, FQHC s, or private practices . Participants also noted that d isruptions to the healthcare system due to the pandemic , e.g., temporary closures and retirement of older providers, further distanced residents from services. Barriers to he althcare access were discussed in multiple ways (e.g., survey, focus groups, interviews) and different issues emerged via the various methods. In the comm unity survey, respondents selected which barriers they ha d experienced from a list. Only 29.4 % of surv ey respondents indicated that they have never experienced any difficulty in getting healthcare. Overall, t he top issues selected were cost of care (32.4%) and ability to schedule an appointment at a convenient time (30.9%) (Figure 114). Differences emerged by race/ethnicity. White respondents were the most likely to report that they did not have an issue accessing care (34.9%) ; ability to schedule an appointment was marked by 53.5 % of Asian \"Preventive care is pretty much nonexistent.

As described above, Latino (42.6%) and Asian (41.9%) respondents were more likely than White (23.6%) respondents to mark cost of care as a barrier (Figure 114). Many Black respondents also mentioned cost of care as a barrier (38.5%). This barrier existed for both preventive care and more complex care. Some p articipants noted that they were able to access free health screenings when offered by the city, hospitals or the FQHCs. However, others did not, and re marked on having to pay a fee for basic preventive services, including COVID -19 tests , as a disincentive . In the words of a Latina resident, \"They sent me a $400 bill for a mammogram, and I wasn't working. Later I learned that there are organizations that offer it for free.\" Even for insured individuals, the cost of medication and treatment of chronic diseas es, including diabetes and cancer, is unaffordable. Many patients are faced with the dilemma of paying for rent, food, or medicine. Cost of care is a ba rrier for low -income residents, overall, but an even greater barrier for undocumented residents, as they are not eligible to receive government insurance. Participants in the Latino focus groups described being particularly wary of going to the hospital be cause of the high cost of care and going only in emergencies. Numerous residents remarked that obtaining charity care is an onerous task and many remarked that they had been rejected . Cost of care is also a barrier for middle -low income families, as they d o not qualify for Medicaid or other government programs, but t hey cannot afford to pay for the medical bills. Even veterans who are insured through the Veterans Administration complained of the hurdles of accessing care and of receiving high hospital bills if they had to seek services in a non -affiliated hospital. Health Insurance Several participants stated that lack of health insurance and insufficient coverage are barriers to accessing healthcare. Healthcare providers and administrators indicated that many patients were uninsured and had difficulty accessing care . Multiple participants noted that uninsured patients would rather seek care from private physicians , rather than the hospital, because they fear the hospital costs. As described by this residen t, \"People that don't have insurance or a primary care doctor have to fin d a private physician. When I first arrived to this country and had a job that didn't offer insurance, I had to spend all day waiting to see the doctor. There were usually about 60 pe ople waiting.\" Participants indicated that even with insurance, people f aced many challenges. As one person stated, \"The lack of accepting insurances [is a big problem] , not a lot places accept state insurance. They may not have the \"right state insurance \" according to some companies .\" Participants enrolled in Medicare were grateful to have this insurance, however, one participant mentioned the high copays and the high cost of medicine without Part D. Census data indicate that health insurance coverage is still an issue for many Hudson C ounty residents, although this varies by neighborhood . A higher percentage of the population in Hudson County was uninsured than in New Jersey (12.4% vs. 7.6%) (Figure 115). Only 2.7% of Hoboken residents were \"If you don't have a doctor who's caring, or for like, people who are on Medicaid and Medicare, it's difficult. Like the seniors who are on Medicare, they have to pay a copay.... If you don't have the Part D for prescriptions, you don't get a deal on the prescriptions. I think that's horrible, after working your whole life... .\" - Key informant interviewee 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 116 uninsured compared to 23.4% of Union City residents , and 14.8% of residents in Jersey City zip code 07304. More than one in ten residents are uninjured i n Jersey City zip codes 07305, 07306, and 07 307. Percentage of the populat ion with private health insurance can be found in Figure 132 in the Appendix . Figure 115. Percent Population Uninsured, by State, County, and Town, 2016 -2020 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, American Co mmunity Survey 5-Year Estimates, 2016 -2020 Children have greater access to primary care than their caregivers. Many children live in mixed immigration status households ; they qualify for free or low -cost state health insurance as U.S. citizens , but their parents do not . Children can also access primary care through school clinics . In 201 6-2020, 5.4% of children under age 19 were uninsured in Hudson County, less than half of the percentage of uninsured adults (12.4%) in the county , but higher than the state averag e (3.9 %) (Figure 116). No children were uninsured in Hoboken and Jersey City zip code 07310 according to the American Community Survey data , compared to 8.5% of children in Union City and 7.2% of children in Jersey City zip code 07304.

As a result, patients waited months for an appointment and face d long wait times prior to the visit . Participants indicated a dearth of both primary care providers and specialists. Focus gro up participants in the healthcare field noted that it was difficult to hire and retain staff in communit y-based non-profit organizations . A major barrier w as inadequate compensation. Staff did not receive competitive salaries and benefits package s due to federal funding regulations, including salary caps , lack of sick leave, and temporary contracts . As a focus group participant described, \"We are all struggling with staff retention, providers, nurses, CMAs, everyone right now . It's almost like we can't afford them. No matter how much we pay people , they can be traveling nurses an d make way more. \" According to participants, sickness, s taff burn out, and safety concerns during the pandemic further exacerbated the situation. Another problem noted related to provider retention were the inadequate affordable childcare options for staff with children. Whereas offering appointments during work hours is a problem for clients without sick leave, it is difficult to staff the evening hours. As a focus grou p participant in the healthcare field explained, \"We couldn't extend hours with staff because they need to pick up their children. The policy of the dayca re providers is if they aren't there by 6 , they call CPS. If we need to give late hours, Head Start sh ould be required to give late hours. \" Participants in the healthcare field remarked that not all communities were represented by the staff; whereas there were plenty of Indian providers who spoke multiple languages, this was not so for Spanish and other languages. As described about mental healthcare providers in the Mental Health section above , more general and specialty care providers are needed in Hudso n County. Surveillance data from 2017 ind icate that Hudson County ha d fewer people per every primary care physician ( 1,950 :1) than New Jersey overall (1,190:1), indicating a smaller person to provider ratio ( Figure 117). The need is noted even more urgent ly with specialty care. For example, the ratio of persons per dentists in Hudson County was 1,590:1 in 2018, compared to 1,160 in New Jersey ( Figure 118). The pandemic has p robably increased this ratio. Figure 117. Ratio of Population to Primary Care Physicians, by State and County, 2017 DATA SOURCE: American Medical Association, Area Health Resource File, as reported by County Health Rankings, University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2017 1,190 :11,950 :1 New Jersey Hudson County \"When we studied the data a few years ago, people didn't understand what we meant about the ratio of people to doctors, that was like 2400: 1, there were also poor numbers for mental health , and I would guess that's gotten worse. \" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 118 Figure 118. Ratio of Population to Dentists, by State and County, 2018 DATA SOURCE: National Provider Identification file, Centers for Medica re and Medicaid Services, Area Health Resource File, as reported by County Health Rankings, University of Wisconsin Population He alth Institute, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2018 Language and Cultural Factors Related to Healthcare Access Participants in the healthcare and social service field noted using different strategies to bridge language and cultural barriers. Many sites, including the hospital and the health department, described having agreements with translation companies to provide telephonic support in any language. In addition, heal thcare partners in most settings develop and disseminate informational materials and provide signage in multiple languages. Staff at many of the healthcare sites are themselves bi - or multilingual speakers. From a cultural perspective, many of the health care institutions in the area hire local staff , wh o represent the community . This strategy goes a long way in building trust with community members and overcoming some of the wariness for hospitals . As one healthc are employee explained, \"Being born and raised here, I can say it's the diversity of who we are that makes us special. Also being residents of the area who can identify what the needs are and try to address them in our agencies as residents.\" Another str ategy is finding cultural ambassadors or credible messengers that can be a go -between for the healthcare institutions and the community. In the view of some participants, this strategy is there on paper, but needs to be implemented more proactively. As exp lained by a parti cipant , \"For people who speak languages other than English, we need not just the commitment to having it there, but actively promoting it, so that influential voices in those communities serve as ambassadors to say, you know if you if you speak Hindi , there's somebody at the medical center for you , or if you speak Pashto .\" 1160 :11590 :1 New Jersey Hudson County \"In general , we see access problems for Latinos, partly language based, and I think I've seen it largely as reflective of the fact that any non -English outreach tends to be an afterthought and not an attempt to truly connect and promote to those communities .\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 119 Certain groups are more represented than others. Healthcare staff explained that good strides had been made in reaching the Black and the Hindi communit ies; however , reaching Latinos and other immigrants has been difficult ; further , more work is needed to increase trust in the Black community . An advocate highlighted the need for more racial equity training for healthcare providers, \"I've heard of horrific experiences bec ause of being African American, healthcare providers don't unde rstand the pain of African American folk .\" When describing the healthcare workforce needed in Hudson County, an administrator described, \"It's not just culturally competent, it's a workforce th at looks like the community and helps with institutional trust issues found in different populations but especially with low income, African American, immigrant, rural, blue collar, politically leaning communities. \" To complement this observation, several Latino residents described language as a barrier to accessing health at hospitals . One patient described this experience, \"They gave me a referral for an eye doctor, they made an appointment for a video call, but I couldn't attend the appointment because i t's always only in English, nothing else . They need staff who are bilingual.\" Community -Based Organizations and Coalitions Hudson County was described as having substantial and strong social services. Community -based nonprofits were seen as mission -drive n and committed to their clients. Partnerships between the community -based organizations, hospitals, schools , and the government were seen as a strength in Hudson County and critical to providing services to those in need . As described by a public health a dministrator, \"Overall, as a city and a group of health industry collaborators, I think the hospital, the FQHCs, and the Department of Health, we have always worked hand in hand to address the needs, we are also involved in an HIV ending committee, but als o access to healthcare, specific and broad topics.\" As mentioned earlier in this report, participants also spoke about city- wide efforts such as HealthierJC , which have promoted prevention, identified and addressed public h ealth gaps, and coordinated effor ts across public health, hospitals, and community -based nonprofits , as well engaged the business community. Residents and public health administrators uplifted the role of community -based nonprofits in bridging the gap to services for those most marginali zed. Residents noted how staff at FQHCs went out of their way to address their physical, mental, and social needs, bein g their first stop for primary healthcare, regardless of immigration status . Many residents seek free screenings from non -profit groups s erving the LGBTQ+, Asian, Latino, and African -American communities. Latino residents expressed trust in the FQHC staff and described getting support to obtain the social services they were eligible for. A community -based service administrator described the ir vision as an integral part of the community, \"We like that the community thinks of us as their go -to place , community health centers, sometimes generations of patients. Sometimes we see someone as a child now bringing their children to pediatrics, from birth to death.\" One limitation that participants noted about community -based groups w as their limited financial and human resources. Sustainability and dependence o n grant funding, that is, funding which is variable and \"From my experience, over 20 years, I feel that the greatest strength are the community -based organizat ions. We have a wide range of individuals who form different communities, even small grassroots community -based organizations, to engage people in healthy ways .\" - Focus group participant 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 120 short -term , were mentioned as prob lems . When speaking about the importance of uplifting community - based partners, a healthc are administrat or noted, \" Most of the strengths we mentioned are double edged. There's a lot of organizations that aren't well resourced financially, they are trying t o do some good work , but with no sustainable resources or capacity to expand. \" In part because of this, m ost partic ipants saw a role for a stronger coalition in Hudson County that includes well -resource d hospitals . Participants expressed that there was a lot of collaboration among government actors, hospitals, schools, and community -based organizations. They remarked that each partner complemented each other and collaborated well, as shown during the pandemic. Focus group participants indicated that there was continued room for growth in this area. Community Vision and Suggestions for the Future Focus group and interview participants were asked for their suggestions for addressing identified needs and their vision for the future. The following section sum marizes and presents participants' recommendations for future consideration. Expanding and Strengthening Behavioral Health and Overall Healthcare Services Health as Human Right: \"It is urgent to have access to free, quality health care\" Almost unanimo usly, cost emerged as a primary barrier to health care access in qualitative discussion . Many residents indicated that healthcare should be free. Residents underscored the value of preventive care as a cost -effective intervention and urged partners to conti nue expandi ng access to these services. Participants also highlighted challenges with health insurance coverage. To address these barriers, residents recommended offering more free screenings , loosening the requirements to qualify for free and/or low -cost health insurance, and simplifying the charity care application . Participants also suggested making more efforts to \"meet people where they are ,\" through mobile clinics and education sessions based in different neighborhoods. Participants highlighted the c ommunity school model, entailing private -public partnerships between the education and healthcare sectors , and the community , as a promising initiative to promote the well -being of low-income families. Greater Accessibility and Availability of Behavioral Health Services Participants remarked on the difficulties faced by all groups, particularly Black, LGBTQ+, veterans, and young residents, to accessing quality, culturally competent mental health care . Participants highlighted the need for more mental healt h workers . Focus group participants and interviewees hoped to see more community -based ment al health services, including recovery programs that are affordable and accept all insurance types. They also advocated for more prevention education programs to add ress problem substance use in the community, especially among youth and veterans . Participants suggested providing more education to address the stigma that surrounds mental health among many cultural groups . The need for more language capacity within the behavioral health services field was also discussed , as well as training in caring for patients of different backgrounds, including LGBTQ + patients , and those who have experienced trauma , such as veterans . \"There is also a deficit related to location, both Newark and NYC have better developed social infrastructure, especially in nonprofit, philanthropic, and people -powered engagement. It's a challenge I've seen linked to our location .\" - Focus group participa nt 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 121 Sexual and Reproductive Health and Women's Health Focus group members and interviewees were concerned about the increase in sexually transmitted infections among some groups, including cisgender women and men -who -have -sex-with -men, and about the repercussions of the rollback in constitutional protections to reproductive choice. Several participants warned that access to sexual and reproductive health services could be curtailed, even if New Jersey has progressive reproductive health policies . They noted that this would unduly affect low- income women and c ommunities of color , thus, exacerbating existing racial/ethnic and social i nequities in maternal and infant health. Some p articipants recommended being vigilant a bout reproductive health and rights protections to support the sexual and reproductive rights of all people in New Jersey. They also underscored the importance of offering comprehensive sexuality education in schools. Focusing on the Upstream Factors and the Social Determinants of Health Inequality Growing inequality emerged as an issue of concer n among most focus groups an d interview participants . Residents noticed this in neighborhood -level differences in school resources, in safety, in employment opportunities, and in the built environment. Participants attributed growing inequality on policies that cater to residents in the highest social strata and expressed frustration at this 'tale of two cities .' Residents suggested that more progressive polices on taxation, employment, education budgets , and healthcare were needed to reverse this trend. Economic and Employment Opportunities Expanding economic opportunities, especially for low -income workers, Latino residents, veterans, LGBTQ + residents, particularly trans gender people , and violence survivors was suggested as a priority area by many assess ment participants. Participants recommended improving initiatives to help those who face barriers to employment obtain jobs. Suggestions included incorporating more vocational training programs in high schools to facilitate transition into the workforce , and education and incentives for employers hiring veterans and trans gender and other LGBTQ + people. Additional proposals included supporting small business owners and providing expanded workforce protections (e.g., sick leave, improved wages , childcare ) for all workers, particularly those in healthcare . Built Environment Several issues emerged as concerns in the built envi ronment. One was overdevelopment leading to overpopulation and loss of green areas; the other was the focus on building luxury rentals, r esulting in gentrification. Participants enjoyed Hudson County's varied public transportation options , its walkability , and its parks . They praised current community efforts to extend green areas supportive of healthy lifestyles. Residents also highlighted the need for redevelopment and urban planning in flood -prone area s to mitigate water damage as an important emergency preparedness strategy. \"My biggest wish for this community is that we don't have s uch an economically diverse community. If there's a way to really help the families with the lowest economic resources to really have more financial stability , that would be ideal .\" - Key informant interviewee 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 122 Housing Access to affordable housing in safe neighborhoods was among the most discussed issues in qualitative discussions. Residents expressed concern about inflation and high taxes, coupled with the lingering economic impact of the pandemic on housing affordability, impending evictions, and homelessness, and looked for initiatives to mitigate these challenges and the high cost of housing. Participants proposed earmark ing more affordable hous ing units in the new developments, including housing for veterans ; implement ing the existing rent control policies, which also apply to foreign -born residents regardless of imm igration status ; and fomenting first-time buyers' subsidies as a promising initiative to address intergenerational poverty. Greater Engagement and Access to Existing Initiatives Access to Services and Community Outreach Interviewees and focus group part icipants observed that information about existing services and programs were not readily accessible to community members. They recommended more be done to raise awareness about existing programs . Participants suggested organizing more education and awarene ss building effort s both in person and virtually in different neighborhoods and in diffe rent languages on topics that most affect the community, including on managing diabetes and high blood pressure, and on recognizing the signs of stroke. Other suggestio ns to bridge access to health and social services included deploying mobile vans to othe r areas in the county ; expanding health clinics that offer care for free and/or at low-cost to both children and families, particularly local and school -based clinics ; and offering appointments outside of the regular workday . Some participants recommended developing a centralized list of health and social service programs and resources , similar to the mental health directory prepared by the Health Department (https://healthierjc.com/mental -health/ ), but for other conditions. Partnerships, Community Engagement, and Community Building Participants valued the robust partnerships established among multiple organizations and acro ss sectors, including grassroots organizations, government, small businesses, social services agencies, and FQHCs , as exemplified by the Partnership for a HealthierJC . Participants suggested continu ing to deepen engagement and collaboration with trusted community -based organizations , such as those representing Asian, Latino , and LGBTQ+ residents, as partners in outreach and information sharing about community service s and programs. Several participant s stressed the importance of engaging faith -based organizations , especially given their reach and level of trust in the community. Other participants discussed the need to collaborate and hire credible messengers - respected community members - to build bri dges with the community. Participants underscore d mor e community outreach, a strong plan to reengage the community , and invest ing in the community as strategic areas moving forward . \"Do more preventive family care, I think it would be very profitable for the state really because it's cheaper to prevent than to deal with .\" - Key informant interviewee 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 123 Key Themes and Conclusions Through a review of the secondary social, economic, and epidemiological data; a community su rvey; and discussions with community residents and stakeholders, this assessment report examines the current health status of Hudson County during an unprecedented time given economic volatility, the COVID -19 pandemic , and the national movement for racial justice . Several overarching themes emerged from this synthesis: Some residents are struggling with lack of employment and economic opportunities. In 2016 -2020 , unemployment rates across Hudson County ranged from 2.4 % in Jersey City zip code 07302 to 7.0% in Jersey City zip code 07305 and 9.2% in Jersey City zip code 07304 . The u nemployment rates map ped onto racial/ethnic groups; residents in zip code 07302 are predominantly White (40.1%) and Asian (32.2%), whereas over two -thirds of residents in zip codes 07304 and 07305 are Black and Latinos . More resources for career transitions and job training and technology were identified as critical to addressin g these disparities . Focus group participants highlighted the need for more support and employer incentive s for veterans and LGBTQ + residents fac ing employment discrimination. Housing affordability is a main concern in Hudson County . Housing affordability was identified as a pressing concern, particularly for persons of color , veteran s, LGBTQ + persons, immi grants, and low - income residents. Participants expressed that too many luxury rentals were being built, instead of affordable housi ng for families. There are m any renters across the area . In New Jersey, 64.0% of housing units were owner occupied in 2016 -2020, in contrast to 32.4% in Hudson County . Home ownership ranged from 12.5% in Jersey City zip code 07310 to 40.6% in Bayonne. Disparities in housing cost burden exist within Hudson County. In Jersey City zip codes 07302 and in Hoboken, less than one in th ree owner -occupied and 44% of renter -occupied households reported high housing costs whereas 64.4% of owner -occupied and 66.5% of renter -occupied residences in Union City reported spending more than 25% of their income on housing costs. Qualitative discuss ions highlighted how veterans in Hudson County tend to work in low -wage jobs and often live in multigenerational housing. Housi ng availability was also cited by interviewees as an important barrier to break ing the cycle of violence. Relocation is one of th e strategies used to prevent revictimization of community and domestic violence survivors. However, according to violence inter rupters, affordable housing options in low -crime neighborhoods are limited. Several focus group and interview participants mentio ned the problem of homelessness in Hudson County communities and indicated that the shelters and temporary housing available we re insufficient to meet the need . Solutions proposed included earmarking more affordable housing units in the new developments ; extending first-time buyers' subsidies , particularly for persons of color; and renovating and repurposing abandoned homes for low-income families . Mental health was identified as a significant community health concern. Mental health was identified as a top community health concern, closely associated with economic instability and chronic conditions . Black residents faced a disproportionate mental health burden. The rate of mental health hospitalizations in 2020 was 70% higher among adult Black residents (107.1 per 100,000) than the Hudson County average (63.1 per 100,000) . Black children had 38% higher hospitalized rates for mental health conditions than the county rate (34.7 per 100,000 vs. 25.2 per 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 124 100,000 ). Residents mentioned stigma and low number s of culturally competent providers as the principal barriers to mental health care access . Residents viewed chronic conditions as prevalent and linked to the s ocial determinants of health . Diabetes and high blood pressure were discussed as prevalent in the comm unity, especially among low-income residents and communities of color, and survey respondents indicated \"overweight/obesity\" was the second most common health issue in their community. However, focus group participants focused on the barriers to healthy li ving including affording hea lthy food s, cost medication , and having time to exercise and be outside. Educational opportunities were seen as an important driving factor for future success. A positive and supportive school environment is important to physi cal and mental wellbeing, as well as to future educational and professional opportunities . Health supports academic success. Schools play an important role in facilitating access to care and helping students stay healthy , and Hudson County public schools engage with communities in multiple ways to support students. However, some schools face challenges due to in sufficient resources. Inequities in school performance are confirmed by graduation rate data from different Hudson County districts. Whereas the hig h school graduation rate in the Hoboken Public School District was 93.6% in 2020 -2021, the public school districts of Bayonne, Union City, and Jersey City had lower graduation rates. There were significant disparities by race/ethnicity withi n districts; 95 .3% of Asian students graduated from high school in Bayonne in 2020 -2021, compared to 86.4% of Black children, and 78.5% of Latino children. Partnership based p rograms such as the community schools and The Tiger's Den at Snyder High School are a promising strategy to equalize outcomes among diverse students. Hudson County has a wealth of social service organizations and health care services, including those providing preventive care, though many residents experience barriers to accessing the se resources. Residents remarked that having a primary care doctor and being linked to a FQHC as facilitating factors to accessing care. They also discussed the importance of culturally competent providers , including providers who spoke their language and looked like them. Veterans and those working with violence survivors highlighted that having peers and mentors who could provide trauma informed care helped to be engaged in care . The high healthcare cost was the top barrier mentioned by residents, providers, and healthc are administrators . Participants in the healthcare field unanimously noted a decline in access to preventive care and mentioned this as a priority strategic area . They uplifted partnerships and community engagem ent as ways to bridge the care gap. Prioriti zation Process and Priorities Selected for Planning Prioritization allows hospitals, organizations, and coalitions to target and align resources, leverage efforts, and focus on achievable goals and strategies for addressing community needs. Priorities for this process were identified by examining data and themes from the CHNA findings utilizing a systematic, engaged approach. This section describes the process and outcomes of the prioritization proce ss. Criteria for Prioritization A set of criteria were u sed to determine the priority issues for action. The RWJBH Systemwide CHNA Steering Committee put forth the following criteria to guide prioritization processes across the RWJBH system. 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 125 Prioritizat ion Criteria Burden : How much does this issue affect heal th in the community? Equity : Will addressing this issue substantially benefit those most in need? Impact : Can working on this issue achieve both short -term and long -term changes? Is there an opportunity to enhance access/accessibility? Systems Change : Is t here an opportunity to focus on/implement strategies that address policy, systems, and environmental change? Feasibility : Can we take steps to address this issue, given the current infrastru cture, capacity, and political will? Collaboration/Critical Mass : Are existing groups across sectors already working on or willing to work on this issue together? Significance to Community : Was this issue identified as a top need by a significant number of community members? Prioritization Process The prioritization p rocess was multifaceted and aimed to be inclusive, participatory, and data -driven. Step 1: Input from Community Members and Stakeholders via Primary Data Collection During each step of the p rimary data collection phase of the CHNA, assessment participants were asked for input. Key informant interviewees and focus group participants were asked about the most pressing concerns in their communities and the three highest priority issues for futur e action and investment (see Key Informant Interview and Focus Gr oup Guides in the Appendices). Community survey respondents were also asked to select up to four of the most important issues for future action in their communities, noted in the Community He alth Issues section of the CHNA Report. Based on responses gathe red from key informant interviews, focus group participants, and community survey respondents, as well as social, economic, and health data from surveillance systems, ten initial issue areas were identified for Hudson County (listed below in no particular order) : Financial Insecurity Unemployment Food Insecurity Housing Chronic Diseases (e.g., heart disease, cancer, diabetes) Infectious Diseases, including COVID -19 Violence Prevention & Safety Mental Health Substance Use Access to Preventive Care Step 2 : Data -Informed Voting via a Prioritization Meeting On October 2 7, 2022, a 90 -minute virtual community meeting was held with the RWJBH Jersey City/Hudson County CHNA Advisory Committee (see Appendix A for members), so Advisory Committee members could discu ss and vote on preliminary priorities for action. During the virt ual prioritization meeting on Zoom, attendees heard a brief data presentation on the key findings from the CHNAs conducted across Hudson County. 2022 RWJBH Jersey City Medical Center/Hudson County Community Health Needs Assessment 126 Next, meeting participants were divided into small groups to reflect on and discuss the data and offer their perspectives and feedback on the various issues. Meeting participants then shared information from their discussions with the full group. At the end of the meeting, using Zoom's polling too l, participants were asked to vote for up to four of the ten prio rities identified from the data and based on the specific prioritization criteria (Burden, Equity, Impact, Systems Change, Feasibility, Collaboration/Critical Mass, and Significance to Commun ity). A total of thirty -two Advisory Committee members voted duri ng the Community Prioritization Meeting. In addition, polling remained open for an additional week to gather responses from those who were not able to attend the meeting. An additional six re sponses were received during this period.

The Plan can be accessed at https://www.rwjbh.org/documents/community-health-needs-assessment/JCMC-CHNA- 1219.pdf Through the CHNA process, health need priorities were chosen based on the Medical Center's capacity, resources, competencies, and the needs specific to the populations it serves. These issues are within the hospital's purview, competency and resources to impact in a meaningful manner. The Implementation Plan addresses the manner in which JCMC will address each priority need and the expected outcome for the evaluation of its efforts. After a comprehensive analysis and rigorous prioritization process resulted in the following final four selected priority areas*: 1. Preventive Health Care Services 2. Access to Health Care (Primary Care and Behavioral Health) 3. Chronic Disease Management (Diabetes & Hypertension) 4. Violence/Safety JCMC is active as a founding member of HealthierJC which is made up of key stakeholders (government, civic, community-based organizations, faith-based organizations and healthcare providers) who are focused on proactively reducing health disparities and improving the health of community members. JCMC will continue to work with the HealthierJC coalition, other providers and community organizations to improve the health and welfare of our communities. *The four priority areas do not represent the full extent of the Medical Center's community benefit activities or its support of the community's health needs. Other significant needs identified through the CHNA include maternal/infant care, transportation, insurance, finances/poverty, language barriers, and outreach to diverse populations. Many of which are already being addressed in existing programs and through other credible means. The hospital, with limited resources, will work on prioritized needs and continually work with the community and other providers and agencies to improve health status. Action for some needs may be better addressed by other agencies/organizations or deferred to another timeframe.01/01/2019 Official Kick off of 2019- 2021 CHNA Process 01/31/2019 Local CHNA Executive Committee Meeting - Review of Draft Survey Data and Secondary Sources Data 4/25/2019 Key Informants Interviews - Community groups and community physicians groups 7/16/2019 Population Health Council Meeting - Review of all Data and Interviews and Establishment of Priority Areas and Define Priority Health Needs 08/09/2019 Brainstorming Session to Develop Priority Health Goals and Strategies2019-2021 CHNA Process09/2019 Meeting with Leaders to review the assigned Goals and identify appropriate Strategies 10/2020 Implementation Plan is finalized 12/19/2019 - Board of Trustees approved the 2019- 2021 CNHA Report to be reviewed and approved by the Community Outreach Steering Committee .
