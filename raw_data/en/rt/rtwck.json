While doctors and scientists are figuring out the ins-and-outs specific to long COVID, chronic debilitating symptoms after a viral infection are surprisingly common. They have been documented after a number of viruses, including SARS and MERS, Epstein-Barr, enteroviruses, human herpesvirus-6, and even the common flu.1 2 Often referred to as post-viral syndrome, each one may look a little different depending on the specific virus, but they all tend to share common symptoms such as fatigue, sleep disturbances, brain fog, changes in mood, joint and muscle pain, and GI issues. If you're struggling with post-viral syndrome and the lingering and seemingly mysterious symptoms that come with it, consider a natural approach to restoring health, one that recognizes the body as a whole. Relief may not be as easy as popping a single pill, but there is hope. The short answer is, we don't exactly know. In some cases, organ and tissue damage caused by the virus, or the body's immune response to the virus, may cause lingering symptoms while the damage heals. A virus may cause immune system dysregulation, which may in turn stimulate or cause a chronic inflammatory state. In response to an infection, the immune system uses free radicals to destroy viruses and bacteria. In cases of post-viral syndrome, the body may not be adequately able to clear these free radicals, leading to a state of oxidative stress, which also causes inflammation. It is likely that the chronic symptoms felt by many after a virus are a result of several processes gone awry. The good news is that, with a worldwide focus on COVID-19 and potentially millions of people who will suffer from long-COVID, it is likely we will see research that improves our knowledge of post-viral syndrome from other illnesses as well\u2014a topic that has generally been ignored or written off as psychosomatic by allopathic medicine. While managing symptoms is important for comfort and day-to-day function, it is critical to address any underlying imbalances that may have predisposed you to a post-viral syndrome in the first place and may be perpetuating it. Functional medicine doctors report that they rarely see a person with post-viral syndrome who doesn't have some imbalance, so take a hard look at your current state of health.3 Even if you are free of any diagnosed disease, you may still have underlying imbalances that need to be addressed. Start building your foundation of health by optimizing each of the following components, adding supplements as necessary for individualized support. It's easy to let a healthy diet slip when you don't feel well and have no energy, but how you eat plays an integral role in how you feel and how well you recover from an illness. Be sure to load up on a rainbow of organic fruits and veggies every day. They not only supply vitamins, minerals, and fiber, but also a wide array of phytonutrients that support healthy immune function and overall health. Make sure to eat healthy fats in the form of nuts, seeds, olives and olive oil, coconut oil, and butter or ghee from pasture-raised cows. Equally important is to ditch the fats and oils that cause inflammation like soy, corn, cottonseed, vegetable oil blends, and fried foods. Add quality protein from free-range, antibiotic-free chicken, wild caught salmon and other wild caught, cold-water fatty fish, grass-fed meats, and pasture-raised eggs. Reduce your consumption of sugar and artificial sweeteners, especially drinks with added sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, or artificial sweeteners. It's almost shocking how far-reaching the impact of blood sugar imbalances are on our health, especially immune function. In addition to increasing the risk of nearly every chronic disease, imbalanced blood sugar affects mood, increases inflammation, and impairs immune function. Eating a healthy diet like the one mentioned above is the absolute first step; supplements provide extra support. Being chronically sick is stressful; couple that with life's everyday stresses plus things going on in the world that you have no control over, and you've got a recipe for some major stress. We can't make all the stress in our lives go away, but we can change how we respond to it. Try breathing exercises, meditation, tai chi, yoga, forest bathing, and allow yourself downtime to relax and do enjoyable things like play games with your kids, take a hot bath, watch your favorite show, or sit under a tree and read. When we are sleeping, our bodies are busy repairing, detoxifying, making hormones, and much more. Sleep deprivation leads to decreased insulin function and increased inflammation. Despite how important it is, sleep can be elusive for fatigued people with post-viral syndrome, so pull out all the stops: practice good sleep hygiene; sleep in a dark, cool room; turn off all electronics at least one hour before bed; and use supplements as necessary. Notice I didn't say exercise, for fear of conjuring up images of treadmills or cross-fit gyms. While exercise is great, for someone recovering from post-viral syndrome, it might not be an option. But movement that is appropriate to your body and energy level is still important, whether it is a walk, some stretching, or exercises done exclusively lying down. The above five components are the foundation of optimal health, and together they influence every aspect of healing and recovery, including a balanced inflammatory response and immune system healing and restoration. If you've mastered these facets and are still struggling, consider adding additional support in the following areas: A buildup of pro-inflammatory compounds from the body's response to a virus may be contributing to post-viral symptoms. Nearly every cell has mitochondria that produce the energy needed to run the body. Mitochondrial dysfunction is believed to be at the heart of many post-viral symptoms.13 14 Having a healthy balance of bacteria in the gut supports optimal immune function as well as a healthy inflammatory response throughout the body.20 While not necessarily life-threatening, losing your sense of smell and taste can have a significant impact on quality of life. Most people will regain their senses as they recover, but if you are left with a lingering loss, you may want to try smell retraining therapy. To try it, you will need at least four essential oils from different categories. Good choices would be lavender (flowery), lemon or orange (fruity), cloves or cinnamon (spicy/aromatic), and eucalyptus (resinous). Smell each oil, one at a time, for 10-20 seconds, concentrating on your memory of each scent as you smell the oil. Do this at least twice a day, up to five times a day until your sense of smell returns, or for at least 12 weeks.17 18 Alpha lipoic acid (600 mg/daily) has also been found to be helpful in restoring sense of smell after upper respiratory tract infections.21 Both of these methods help to improve sense of smell by stimulating the re-growth and activation of olfactory receptors.
