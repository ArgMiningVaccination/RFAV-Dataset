Methods: Eighty adult male C57BL/6 inbred mice were randomly allocated to ve groups treated with biotherapy (nosode) of T. cruzi 12dH (12 33) pre- and post-infection; Phosphorus 12dH post-infection; infected control treated with control solution and unin- fected control. The biotherapy was prepared by the Costa method from the blood of mice experimentally infected with the Y strain of T. cruzi .Phosphorus was used because of its clinical and reportorial similarity to Chagas disease. T. cruzi (104) sanguineous forms were inoculated intraperitoneally per animal. Parasitaemia was monitored, leukocyte and serological responses were evaluated at 0, 7, 14 and 42 days after infection. The prepatent and patent periods of parasitaemia, maximum of parasitaemia, day of maximum parasi-taemia and mortality rates were compared between groups.Results: A signicantly shorter period of patent parasitaemia was observed in the group treated with the biotherapy before infection ( p< 0.05) than in the other groups. This group also had the lowest parasitaemias values at 9, 13, 15 ( p< 0.05), 17 ( p< 0.05), 22, 24 and 28 days, a lower rate of mortality and a signicant increase of lymphocytes compared to theinfected control group. The Phosphorus group had the longest period of patent parasitae- mia, higher maximum parasitaemia, and a signicant reduction of lymphocyte numbers,but no mortality. The infected control group had the highest mortality rate (not statisti-cally signicant), and the highest IgG titres at 42 days ( p< results suggest that pre-treatment biotherapy modulates host immune response to T. cruzi , mainly during the acute phase of the infection.

One of the main characteristics of homeopathic medi- cines is the low concentration of substances they contain.With potencies above approximately 12cH, there are nomolecules of the original substance present to provide a spe- cic molecular stimulus. 3However, there is much evidence that these 'ultramolecular' dilutions exert biological effectsin living systems 4that cannot be explained with our current knowledge. There are numerous speculative hypotheses asto how such information might be captured and stored atultradiluted preparations, if this indeed occurs. 5 Biotherapies, also called nosodes, are homeopathic med- icines, in which the aetiologic agent is in ac- cordance with the homeopathic pharmacotechnic method. Biotherapies are widely used in homeopathy, and theiruse in treatment and prophylaxis of infectious and parasiticdiseases have been investigated and questioned by manyauthors. They have been used as a substitution for vaccines,in the absence of scientic evidence. 6But there is little in- formation available based on adequate methodology, ontheir action. In Chagas disease it is important to develop strategies to reduce the inflammation that leads to severe organic dys-function without compromising the control of parasitism. 7 Hahnemann developed the concept that chronic disease isbased on an acquired and/or hereditary principle, whichhe called ''miasms'', now sometimes called diatheses.The miasm or diathesis is a state of, or a disposition ofthe body to be susceptible to certain types of diseases, and the impact of an aetiological agent on an individual's predisposition. 8 In the present study, we analyzed whether an ultradiluted and dynamized biotherapy preparation from blood ofT. cruzi infected mice and the homeopathic medicine Phosphorus induced protective or therapeutic effects in mice experimentally infected with T. cruzi . We used a murine model of Chagasic infection by T. cruzi Y strain since it is well characterized as having dened AP and chronic phase (CP). Materialand methods Animals Eighty adult C57BL/6 male mice bred at CECAL- Fiocruz, RJ, living in conventional cages (maximum of 8mice/cage), with a controlled temperature (22 /C63 /C14C) and light cycle (12 h dark/day, lights on at 06:30), and receivingfood and water ad libitum . The methodology was autho- rized by the Ethics Committee for Animal Experimentation (CEUA-Fiocruz, license number: P0209-04). Parasite.

The biotherapy was made in a specialized homeopathic pharmacy from blood of experi-mentally infected mice with the T. cruzi Y strain (1 /C210 4blood forms of T. cruzi /mL), according to Living Nosodes technique,10the blood containing living microorganisms initially diluted in a saline solution to the 11dH potencythen in hydroalcoholic solution.

Control solution was 15% ethanol in water. Treatment. Mice were randomly allocated to ve exper- imental groups ( n= 16): Treated with biotherapy before experimental infection for a total of 20 days, with an interval of 10 days in themiddle of this period (Bbi).Treated with biotherapy post-infection for 20 post-infection for 20 days (Phosphorus ). Treated with control solution before and after infection (infected control). Control group not infected (uninfected control). Dose was 3 drops (0.6 mL) daily, orally by dropper. Experimental infection of mice. Animals of experimental groups were inoculated intraperitoneally with 1 /C2104 blood forms of T. cruzi Y strain. After detection of parasitaemic peak mice were euthanized, blood was ob-tained by cardiac punction and the inoculum was adjustedin a Neubauer chamber. Parameters evaluated. From the fth day after infection, parasitaemia (parasites/mL of blood) was monitored at 2 days intervals in a Neubauer chamber. Prepatent and patent periods, maximum of parasitaemia, day of maximum para-sitaemia, mortality rate and time of death were determined.The period post-infection during which the parasitaemiawas detectable at fresh blood examination was consideredthe AP, and the period post-infection when the micepresented parasitaemia sub-patent was considered the CP.At 0, 7, 14 and 42 days post-infection (D0, 7, 14, 42) blood was sampled to analyze the leukocyte response, by global (Neubauer chamber) and differential (smears stained withPanotico Kit) leukocytes count. At D7, 14, and 42 the hu-moral immune response was evaluated by Indirect Immuno-fluorescence 11for anti- T. cruzi IgM and IgG. Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis of the prepatent and patent periods was completed using the analysis ofvariance (ANOVA), the mortality rate was analyzed by Chi-square test. To analyze the parasitaemia, serological titres and leukocyte parameters were analyzed by the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test followed by the Mann-Whitney test when necessary.

The mathematical reper- torization of these rubrics is shown in Table 2 , 11 medicines were selected, ordered by symptoms represented andweighting. The homeopathic medicine Phosphorus mostly fully reflected the clinical and repertorial image of theT. cruzi infection, covering the greatest number of symp- toms, with the heaviest weighting. The pathogenetic image of Phosphorus is associated with weakness and sudden prostration. It also has been related to heart and liver disorders, inflammation of the intestines andother inflammatory alterations 12as well as haemorrhage caused by irritative, inflammatory and degenerative actionsresulting in blood vessel damage. 13These characterize Phosphorus as a medicine of syphilitic diathesis.14The study of Chagas disease diathesic origin shows a relation between syphilitic diathesis and Chagas disease. 9These ndings possibility leads to the adoption of a new prophylactic and therapeutic approaches. Experimental evaluations At D5 T. cruzi tripomastigotes forms were detected in the blood of infected mice. The results of parasitologicalparameters ( Table 3 ) did not show any variation of the prepatent period between infected groups, nor did the dayof maximum parasitaemia (mean D7 for all groups). But variation of parasitaemia values was found ( Figure 1 ). A shorter patence period ( p< 0.05) and lower parasitaemia values were observed in the T. cruzi biotherapic pre-treated group (Bbi) than in the placebo group at D09, 13, 15(p< 0.05), 17 ( p< 0.05), 22, 24 and 28. Phosphorus treated mice showed a longer patent period than the remaininggroups and higher parasitaemias at D7 ( p= 0.05) and 20 (p< 0.01) than the infected control group and at D07 (<0.05), 17(<0.05), 20(<0.05), and 24 (<0.05), compared to Bbi. Nevertheless, no death was observed in thePhosphorus group during the experimental period. The mortality in T. cruzi experimentally infected mice is a result of both the parasite and of the host's own immuneresponse. Excessive parasite multiplication in the host canlead to death in susceptible animals. 15The 100% survival rate observed in the Phosphorus treated group, although not statistically signicant (which may be due to relatively small numbers), suggests an action on the T. cruzi inducedmorbidity, since this group showed higher maximum of parasitaemia ( p< 0.05) than Bbi and infected control groups, and more resistance, since all the animals attained the CP of infection. High parasitaemia with low mortalityinT. cruzi infected mice suggests a regulatory and anti-in- flammatory action, 16or an action on the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators, that should be stud-ied when homeopathy is employed. The results suggesta difference in effect between the biotherapy pre-treatedgroup (Bbi), the Phosphorus treated group and the infected control group, the latter exhibited the highest mortality rate. All infected groups showed a decrease in number of lymphocytes from 0 to 7 days post-infection, characteristicof the AP of infection, and already well described. Never-theless, after D7, only the group treated before infection(Bbi) showed a signicant increase of lymphocytes(p< 0.05) during the course of infection ( Figure 2 ), and a signicant increase in neutrophils count ( p< 0.05) (Figure 3 ), showing an action of innate and acquired immu- nity on parasitaemia control during the AP in this group. Discussion More experiments are needed to elucidate the specic mechanism of the biotherapy immunomodulatory action inT. cruzi infection. It is important to develop strategies aiming to reduce the inflammation that leads to severe heartdysfunction, without compromising the parasitism control. A new concept of immunomodulation was proposed based on a new response ability of the organism, rather Table 1 Repertorial rubrics of T. cruzi infection symptoms (Sihore Max Software).

Since the immune system is sub- jected to a complex network of cellular and molecular inter-actions, it seems that the ''qualitative'' aspect rather than thequantitative can be important and a single 'information'ofan immunomediator can be understood by the organism. 3 Recent studies report that ultradiluted antigens can transfersignals to the immune system and modulate its responsewhen the organism is in challenge with the related anti- gen, 17,5,3,18and even before the challenge.5The auto- reactivity of T-cells is managed by the immune system,dependent upon the concentration of the antigen they en-counter: if they ''see'' high concentrations of a self-antigenthey are deleted (killed), but when exposed to low dosesthey undergo a special kind of active inhibition (called'bystander suppression'). 19 Therefore, the ability of ultradiluted antigen to manipu- late the nature of a specic immune response to T. cruzi antigens, stimulating regulatory T-cells, avoiding immuno-mediated tissue lesions observed at T. cruzi infection should be studied. The Phosphorus treated group showed a signicant (p< 0.05) decrease of lymphocytes number at D42 (Figure 2 ). This could be with increased mono- cytes count ( p< 0.05) ( Figure 4 ) observed in this group, which could be due to the greater parasitaemia in this group during the AP of infection. The excessive nitric oxide (NO)production by macrophages during T. cruzi infection,among others factors, is suppressive to T cell. 20Neverthe- less, the decrease of lymphocyte number in the CP of infec-tion could be important to avoid immunomediated lesions. These ndings should be better explained by further histo- pathological evaluation. The humoral immune response was studied by analysis of IgM and IgG levels at D7, 14 and 42 ( Table 4 ). Signi- cant variations of IgM levels between groups were not ob-served, but Bbi, Bpi and Phosphorus group tended to show higher IgM titres than the infected control group. At D7 themice of the biotherapy pre-treated group (Bbi) showed an IgG response not observed in the other groups. At D42 mice of infected control group showed the highest IgG titres(1:128) ( p< 0.05). It may demonstrate a lower control of immune response in the CP of infection, this may be asso-ciated with host immunomediated lesions. Previous studieshave indicated that parasite-specic antibody production isimportant in both resistance to and pathogenesis of dis-ease. 20-22B cells and specic immunoglobulins are related to the autoimmune mechanisms of Chagas disease during the CP and higher serum IgG levels are found in symptom-atic patients. 22051015202530354045 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 20 22 24 26 28days post-infectionParasites x 105 / mL of bloodBbi Bpi Figure 2 Mean rank of lymphocytes number in experimental groups treated with homeopathy, placebo and control group not infected, at 0, 7, 14 and 42 days post- T. cruzi 7 14 42 dias PI* Figure 3 Mean rank of neutrophils number in experimental groups treated with homeopathy, placebo and control group notinfected, at 0, 7, 14 and 42 days post- T. cruzi infection. *Variation Mean rank of monocytes number at 0, 7, 14 and 42 days post- T. cruzi infection. * p, 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test.Homeopathy in T. cruzi infected mice L Rodrigues de Almeida et al 68 HomeopathyConclusions Our research suggests that oral pre-treatment with bio- therapy modulates host immune response to T. cruzi infec- tion, mainly in the AP of the infection. These results werenot observed when biotherapic was given after an infectiouschallenge. Based on the principle of similarity, the homeopathic medicine Phosphorus seems indicated in T. cruzi infection symptoms, as well as its diathesis. Our results suggest an action on the impact of T. cruzi infection, since no death occurred in this group. The action of the biotherapy andPhosphorus on the T. cruzi infection should be better studied. There are still many questions and studies possible, mainly about the ultradilutions employed; the way and themoment of administration of the medicine and the prepara- tion of the biotherapic: infected blood or isolated parasite?
