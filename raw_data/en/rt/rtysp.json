Being our first child we weren't very aware of the milestones a child goes through and enjoyed all her achievements as they came. In the first 2 years all her milestones such as crawling, teething, walking and feeding habits looked absolutely normal when compared to others. However towards the end of her second year we noticed that our child did not respond to our gestures and seemed a bit aloof or lacked interest in the things around her. Her speech for a 2 year child was fine; however she wasn't picking up new words or lacked the desire to learn new words as other kids of her age did. By the time she was 3 yrs we started to notice that she preferred to stay aloof, away from social interactions as well as verbal communication with other children. Time went by and our lack of knowledge prevented us from seeking the correct counseling and intervention. On entering preschool we got our first inclination of the diagnosis as the teachers there began to notice certain patterns and referred us to a therapist. By that time she had pronounced fear of loud, sudden noises such as bursting of crackers, fear of crossing the streets and sudden flashes of light such as while taking photographs. She had a peculiar habit of lifting her skirt repetitively or asking for the same thing aggressively over and over again till she got it. She liked rocking while sitting and could not relate to our emotions of anger in response to her behavior. Changes on starting treatment At this stage we were referred to Dr. Anish Vaknalli as our therapist had seen numerous children doing well under his treatment and progressed significantly. On our first visit, doctor spent close to an hour with us observing her movements and social interactions and asked her entire history, preferences and habits thoroughly. From what I understood about Homeopathy and his specialized approach was that unlike conventional therapies where the same line of treatment is prescribed for a particular condition, here, every child is gauged differently and treated constitutionally. On starting this line of Homeopathic treatment with Dr. Anish we began to notice changes after the first couple of months which are in the sequence as follows: The first and most important change we noticed was that our child who till date did not bother to ask for things or share her likings or dislikes began to do so and felt less vulnerable, fearful or shy is what we felt. She lacked eye contact and always looked away while spoken to. Now, she had more confidence and made continuous eye contact which was totally absent prior to this treatment. Though she did well in her school and got good overall grades she lacked the ability to communicate through essay writings and emotions which we felt were changing too. Her repetitive actions reduced by more than 50%, though her fear of loud noises and light flashes took a bit longer to subside, which eventually did significantly. After 8-11 months of continuous treatment I am glad to say that my daughter (Ameya) is coping much better than she did a year ago with all the new introductions made in her life. Her social interaction has noticeably increased and knows what she wants and asks for it confidently. I am sure in the following months she will be as normal as any other child and encourage parents like me to opt for Homeopathy along with any other therapy they choose. Father of Ameya (Case number 657, Name changed) Cured Case 2 Name: Master Ahsan|Age 5 | Diagnosis: Autism | Evaluation Method: ATEC (Autism treatment evaluation checklist) (As closely narrated by the parent and translated) We live in a small town in M.P known as Katni. Our son of 5 years began schooling where the principal and teachers noticed certain behavioral patterns preventing our child from moving on to the next grade. At first, not knowing what Autism was, we considered his behavior as a reflection of his personality and accepted that he wasn't as smart as the other kids in his school. Fortunately, the school's Principal happened to visit Dr. Anish Vaknalli online and convinced that he would be the right person to help our child. We travelled overnight and scheduled an appointment with Dr. Vaknalli who happened to see us in person a couple of days later. On our first visit we learnt that our child suffered from ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) and has numerous characteristics which were as follows: He had an unusual quite disposition and liked to play by himself. Very capricious by nature and demonstrated numerous repetitive gestures. He could continuously write on a wall and had a distinct affinity for mechanical toys. He showed fear towards large gathering of people, loud noises and of water. Academically he lacked the ability to excel and was not able to go beyond writing simple alphabets and numbers. Changes on starting treatment It's been only 3 months since we have started the treatment and amazed at the changes we have seen in him which has helped him cope better with his surroundings. Prior to the treatment he was a shy, quiet boy who avoided his brother and any form of playing activity. Now, he enjoys playing with his brother and looks forward to the same. His lack of communication and non-responsive behavior when questioned has dramatically changed. He now replies to questions, asks for things when he needs them and confidently communicates his needs. He never asked for food or when he needed to use the toilet. Now, he gives us clear indications for the same and does so confidently. He has stopped repetitively writing on the walls and has very less fear of sudden loud noises. Previously, he was startled by sudden loud sounds, whereas now he first analyses whether the sounds are threatening and then responds. He miraculously got over his fear of water and now enjoys his baths and even noticed him doing so when it rained here heavily. We are aware that the treatment has miles to go before we see a complete reversal. We are as committed as our doctor has been and intend to continue the same till he recovers. Having seen such drastic changes in only 3 months we are optimistic of the treatment here and are thankful to the schools Principal and Dr. Anish Vaknalli, who have given our son a new life.

In this period doctors injected here with a lot of general antibiotics following which she was transferred to Jaslok hospital wher her treatment for CMV began. As a result of this condition we found her speech and her motor skills were delayed. We consulted a psychiatrist, neurologist and what not. We were very worried for her speech and motor function delay. One day we watched an interview on Autism and Homeopathy by luck. Though my daughter was not diagnosed with Autism we knew that homeopathy was very good for conditions with symptoms like autism. I went through Dr. Anish Vaknalli's website and happened to consult him soon after. I am now taking medicines for 2 years for my daughter and during this period she has improved a lot. On starting treatment she started talking, became much calmer and started to focus and concentrate which was absent before. She was very scared of loud voices like crackers, lightening etc and now she is very much better. I am very grateful to Dr. Anish Vaknalli and our treatment is still on. Best Regards, Parent of Miss...(Case no: 998, Name undisclosed on request of Parent) Cured Case 4 Name: Master Shiv.. | Diagnosis: ADHD with Autism traits | Evaluation Method: ATEC (Autism treatment evaluation checklist) Dear Dr. Vaknalli, this is regarding my nephew Shiv.... On 9th August 2011 we received the homeopathic medicine sent through you as per our order no.477. We started giving the medicine as suggested by you from 10th August 2011 onwards. Shiv... has been attending 'Play group' at 'Kid..' since 4th July 2011. He enjoys going to school. He also has been getting 'Behavioral Therapy' from 26th June 2011. Since last few days we have observed that his vocabulary has increased. He repeats a new word as soon as he hears it or even repeats words, when asked to for eg. Zoo, Circus, Cake, Ice-Cream, Auto, Nal (tap), Joker, Kitchen, Lucknow, etc. Now he enjoys watching his surroundings and points out to cow, horse, scooter, rickshaw and other objects which he sees on the road or in a magazine or even on T.V. He recognizes alphabets and numbers. He picks up any magazine or newspaper and at random points out individual alphabets (A-Z) and also numbers ( 1-10). He takes interest in solving puzzles, recognizing pictures of fruits, animals, vegetables, recognizing colours and shapes. He is now more obedient during 'work-time' both at home and during the 'Behavioral Therapy'. However, since last one week he looks into the eyes of the 'Behavioral Therapist' or rather has a proper eye contact with her, when she asks him to repeat words after her. Of course, to make him look into her eyes she holds his chin and makes him listen to a sentence or a phrase, so that he can repeat the same. Now he tries to combine two or three words. Now he does not throw tantrums when asked to repeat a phrase or a sentence. When he is in a good mood he does recite full nursery rhymes - 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star', 'JohnyJohny Yes Papa' and the song 'ChandaHaiTu, MeraSurajHaiTu'. He continues to jump while watching 'commercials' as though 'springs' are attached to his feet. Now he can recognize his relatives and says their names Now he has started enjoying his baths. He does not make fuss while taking medicines. I look forward to your guidance in this matter. Kindly let us know as to when we should get in touch with you, after this. Most Recent update (16th Nov, 2011) as narrated... He has started picking up new words very quickly. Besides repeating the words and sentences that he has been made to learn over a period of time, he uses short sentences at appropriate time. Earlier when asked to talk over the phone, he used to stay quiet and listen to what the person at the other end of the line said, but now he readily recites poems, songs, says numbers from 1-30 and alphabets from A-Z when we ask him to do so. He tries to reply to the questions asked over the phone by his father on a daily basis. He has developed a good ear for music. He catches a new tune and sings a song with a near perfect tune but using his own words to fit the tune! At times he even tries to express his feelings and says a full sentence but we are not able to understand the same. Yours sincerely, VB (Name changed) Autism and Homeopathy: Dr. Anish Vaknalli's observations What is Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)? Autism is a childhood disorder in which the normal ability of a child to perceive, process, interpret and respond to external inputs is affected, making it harder for them to communicate and interact in a social environment. Children with this condition find it challenging to link words to their meanings. Parents will usually complaint that their child isn't responding to their name when called or pays no heed when asked to follow simple commands. Speech tends to be initially gibberish and usually develops late. Till date, there is no known definite cause of ASD. Suspected causes are: Genetics, vaccines, food malabsorption, environmental toxins, brain structure and function. Autistic children tend to experience and react abnormally to sensory inputs like loud sounds, bright light, touch, crowds etc. and may show repetitive self-stimulatory behavior (stimming) such hand flapping, rocking, head banging, excessive jumping, spinning objects etc. Stimming is believed to help the child calm down or pleasantly stimulate their abnormal sensitivity to stimuli. Autism is a spectrum disorder as children in this spectrum may experience a wide range of symptoms and their level of disability can vary considerably. Children with 'Asperger's Syndrome' are considered to be 'High-Functioning Autism' as they usually have a normal to high IQ and may only lack in social interaction and non-verbal communication (physical appearance, body language, distance, voice etc). Homeopathic treatment for Autism Spectrum Disorders, ADHD, ADD, Asperger's syndrome, delayed speech, behavioral and learning disabilities is a bit complex. Children tend to present this condition differently and in layers. An individualistic approach is required in each and every case. Different homeopathic medicines may be prescribed at different stages of this condition, working to unfold and cure the different layers one by one. The ultimate outcome of our treatment is rewarding and we consistently see a significant reversal in a large number of children. Also, not all those treated improve in the same time frame or to the same extent and usually depends on the complexity and age at which treatment is initiated. I therefore strongly urge parents to start this treatment as early as 1.5-2 years of age for maximum benefits. Older children and those in their teens too benefit and is never too late to start. We strongly recommend parents to be patient, positive, committed and observant to the changes during the course of our Homeopathic treatment as prescribing the correct remedy as this condition unfolds is the key to treating this condition successfully. Safety & Efficacy: Homeopathic remedies in general have no known side effects whatsoever. They are recommended for all age groups and can be taken for longer durations without the fear of any harmful side-effects. You can be 100% sure of their safety and efficacy.
