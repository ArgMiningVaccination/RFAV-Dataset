He has been able to help thousands of residents with his unique approach to holistic health care. Nutrition Response Testing is an approach that uses different points on the surface of the body that relate to the state of health and to the flow of energy to treat and improve the function of each organ and/or gland in the body. The NRT analysis is done by testing the body's neurological reflexes and acupuncture points. Each NRT reflex represents a specific organ, tissue, or function and allows the practitioner to locate functional disorders that may be contributing to numerous health problems. We at Natural Health Renewal Center employ a multidisciplinary approach to help our patients, who suffer from many different health challenges. Along with specific, gentle, full-body chiropractic care to remove nerve interference, we use Nutrition Response Testing (NRT) to find the cause of many difficult health problems. Many people have come to us as a last resort because of an inability to find help for their health challenges and have been amazed at how successful our treatment is. We have been able to find the cause of their health problems, and have been able to help them overcome many of their challenges and restore their bodies to a more optimum state of health. For more information on NRT, go to [http://www.brwellness.com/docs...](http://www.brwellness.com/docs/2011-Nutrition-Response-Testing.pdf) Along with chiropractic care and Nutrition Response Testing, we specialize in restorative/functional endocrinology. This is a natural, holistic way to restore function to the endocrine system and to balance hormones in both men and women. In Western medicine, when it comes to balancing hormones, the assumption is that there are no restorative capabilities. Understanding and respecting human physiology and how the endocrine system regulates bodily functions, and working with that physiology rather than against it, brings about amazing results. The hypothalamus and pituitary glands, or what we refer to as the HP axis, control and regulate endocrine function and hormone balance. Our approach to endocrinology with the HP axis helps to restore normal function. As function improves, and proper nutrition and lifestyle changes are adopted, many conditions, such as thyroid dysfunction, menstrual disorders, menopausal symptoms, adrenal dysfunction, chronic fatigue, depression, weight problems, prostate conditions, and much more can be alleviated or eliminated.
