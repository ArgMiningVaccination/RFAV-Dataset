It was formed by the users of these medicines and therapies together with medical professionals, including doctors and therapists, who work with an Anthroposophic approach to healthcare, healing and diagnosis. PAFAM's main aim is to promote and enable the furtherance of Anthroposophic Medicine within the UK and to support the individual's right to choose their own medical treatment whilst becoming more aware of their personal responsibility towards their individual healthcare process. The main aim of Anthroposophic Medicine is to stimulate the natural healing forces within the human being, taking into consideration the physical body as well as the soul and spirit of the individual. In other words, Anthroposophic Medicine treats the whole person in a uniquely holistic way and works as an extension to allopathic medical care. PAFAM is run by a committee elected annually and is also a member of [EFPAM](http://www.efpam.eu/), the European Federation of Patients Associations for Anthroposophic Medicine, of which amongst others, France, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Germany are also members.
