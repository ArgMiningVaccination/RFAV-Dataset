The Chemical C21H27N5O4S; the molecular weight is 445.55; the structural formula is shown below: NN H3C CONHCH2CH2SO2NHCONH Glipizide is a whitish, odorless powder with a pKa of 5.9. I t is insoluble in water and alcohols, but soluble in 0.1 N NaOH; it is freely soluble in dimethy lformamide. Glipizide extended - release tablets are formulated as a once -a-day controlled release tablet for oral use and is designed to deliver 2.5, 5, or 10 mg of glipizide. Inert ingredients in the 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg formulations are: poly ethylene oxide, hypromellose, magnesium stearate, sodium chloride, red ferric oxide, cellulose acetate, polyethylene gly col, Opadry\u00ae blue (OY -LS-20921)(2.5 mg tablets), Opadry\u00ae white (YS-2-7063)(5 mg and 10 mg tablet) a nd black ink (S -1-8106). System Components and Performance Glipizide extended -release tablets are similar in appearance to a conventional tablet. I t consists, however, of an osmotically active drug core surrounded by a semipermeable membrane. The core itself is divided into two lay ers: an \"active\" lay er containing the drug, and a \"push\" lay er containing pharmacologically inert (but osmotically active) components. The membrane surrounding the tablet is permeable to water but not to drug or osmotic excipien ts. As water from the gastrointestinal tract enters the tablet, pressure increases in the osmotic lay er and \"pushes\" against the drug lay er, resulting in the release of drug through a small, laser -drilled orifice in the membrane on the drug side of the tab let. Glipizide extended -release tablets are designed to provide a controlled rate of delivery of glipizide into the gastrointestinal lumen which is independent of pH or gastrointestinal motility . The function of the glipizide extended -release tablets depe nds upon the existence of an osmotic 2gradient between the contents of the bi -layer core and fluid in the GI tract. Drug delivery is essentially constant as long as the osmotic gradient remains constant, and then gradually falls to zero. The biologically inert components of the tablet remain intact during GI transit and are eliminated in the feces as an insoluble shell. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action: Glipizide appears to lower blood glucose acutely by stimulating the release of insulin from th e pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets. Extrapancreatic effects also may play a part in the mechanism of action of oral sulfony lurea hy pogly cemic drugs. Two extrapancreatic effects shown to be important in the action of glipizide are an increase in insulin sensitivity and a decrease in hepatic glucose production. However, the mechanism by which glipizide lowers blood glucose during long -term administration has not been clearly established. Stimulation of insulin secretion by glipizide in response to a meal is of major importance. The insulinotropic response to a meal is enhanced with glipizide extended -release tablet administration in diabetic patients. The postprandial insulin and C -peptide responses continue to be enhanced after at least 6 months of treatment. I n 2randomized, double -blind, dose -response studies comprising a total of 347 patients, there was no significant increase in fasting insulin in all glipizide extended -release tablet -treated patients combi ned compared to placebo, although minor elevations were observed at some doses. There was no increase in fasting insulin over the long term. Some patients fail to respond initially , or gradually lose their responsiveness to sulfony lurea drugs, including g lipizide. Alternatively , glipizide may be effective in some patients who have not responded or have ceased to respond to other sulfony lureas. Effects on Blood Glucose : The effectiveness of glipizide extended -release tablets in ty pe 2 diabetes at doses fr om 5 -60mg once daily has been evaluated in 4 therapeutic clinical trials each with long -term open extensions involving a total of 598 patients. Once daily administration of 5, 10 and 20 mg produced statistically significant reductions from placebo in hemo globin A 1C, fasting plasma glucose and postprandial glucose in patients with mild to severe ty pe2 diabetes. In a pooled analy sis of the patients treated with 5 mg and 20 mg, the relationship between dose and glipizide extended -release tablet's effect of reducing hemoglobin A 1C was not established. However, in the case of fasting plasma glucose patients treated with 20 mg had a statistically significant reduction of fasting plasma glucose compared to the 5 mg-treated group. The reductions in hemoglobin A 1C and fasting plasma glucose were similar in y ounger and older patients. Efficacy of glipizide extended -release tablets was not affected by gender, race or weight (as assessed by body mass index). I n long-term extension trials, efficacy of glipizide e xtended - release tablets was maintained in 81% of patients for up to 12 -months. In an open, two -way crossover study 132 patients were randomly assigned to either glipizide extended -release tablets or glipizide tablets for 8 weeks and then crossed over to t he other drug for an additional 8 weeks. Glipizide extended -release tablet administration resulted in 3significantly lower fasting plasma glucose levels and equivalent hemoglobin A 1C levels, as compared to glipizide tablets. In 12 week, well -controlled stu dies there was a maximal average net reduction in hemoglobin A1C of 1.7% in absolute units between placebo -treated and GLI PIZIDE EXTENDED - RELEASE -treated patients. Other Effects: It has been shown that glipizide extended -release tablet therapy is effec tive in controlling blood glucose without deleterious changes in the plasma lipoprotein profiles of patients treated for ty pe 2 diabetes. In a placebo -controlled, crossover study in normal volunteers, glipizide had no antidiuretic activity , and, in fact, led to a slight increase in free water clearance. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism: Glipizide is rapidly and completely absorbed following oral administration in an immediate release dosage form. The absolute bioavailability of glipizide was 100% after sin gle oral doses in patients with ty pe2 diabetes. Beginning 2 to 3 hours after administration of glipizide extended -release tablets, plasma drug concentrations gradually rise reaching maximum concentrations within 6 to 12 hours after dosing. With subsequent once daily dosing of glipizide extended -release tablets, effective plasma glipizide concentrations are maintained throughout the 24 hour dosing interval with less peak to trough fluctuation than that observed with twice daily dosing of immediate release g lipizide. The mean relative bioavailability of glipizide in 21 males with ty pe2 diabetes after administration of 20 mg glipizide extended -release tablets, compared to immediate release glipizide (10 mg given twice daily ), was 90% at steady -state. Steady -state plasma concentrations were achieved by at least the fifth day of dosing with glipizide extended -release tablets in 21 males with ty pe2 diabetes and patients y ounger than 65 years. Approximately 1 to 2 days longer were required to reach steady -state in 24 elderly (65years) males and females with ty pe2 diabetes. No accumulation of drug was observed in patients with ty pe2 diabetes during chronic dosing with glipizide extended -release tablets. Administration of glipizide extended -release tablets with food has no effect on the 2 to 3 hour lag time in drug absorption. I n a single dose, food effect study in 21 healthy male subjects, the administration of glipizide extended -release tablet immediately before a high fat breakfast resulted in a 40% increase in the glipizide mean Cmax value, which was significant, but the effect on the AUC was not significant. There was no change in glucose response between the fed and fasting state. Markedly reduced GI retention times of the glipizide extended -release tablets over prolonged periods (e.g., short bowel sy ndrome) may influence the pharmacokinetic profile of the drug and potentially result in lower plasma concentrations. I n a multiple dose study in 26 males with ty pe2 diabetes, the pharmacokinetics of glipizide w ere linear over the dose range of 5 to 60 mg of glipizide extended -release tablets in that the plasma drug concentrations increased proportionately with dose. I n a single dose study in 24 healthy subjects, four 5-mg, two 10-mg, and one 20-mg glipiz ide extended -release tablets were bioequivalent. I n a separate single dose study in 36 healthy subjects, four 2.5 -mg glipizide extended -release tablets were bioequivalent to one 10 extended -release tablets.4Glipizide is eliminated primarily by hepatic biotransformation: less than 10% of a dose is excreted as unchanged drug in urine and feces; approximately 90% of a dose is excreted as biotransformation products in urine (80%) and feces (10%). The major metabolites of glipizide are products of hy pogly cemic activity A minor metabolite which accounts for less than 2% of a dose, an acety lamino -ethyl benzene derivative, is reported to have 1/10 to 1/3 as much hy pogly cemic activity as the parent compound. The mean total body clearance of glipizide was approximately 3liters per hour after single intravenous doses in patients with ty pe2 diabetes. The mean apparent volume of distribution was approximately 10liters. Glipizide is 98 -99% bound to serum proteins, primar ily to albumin. The mean terminal elimination half -life of glipizide ranged from 2 to 5 hours after single or multiple doses in patients with ty pe2 diabetes. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of glipizide after single dose admi nistration to older diabetic subjects compared to y ounger healthy subjects. There is only limited information regarding the effects of renal impairment on the disposition of glipizide, and no information regarding the effects of hepatic disease. However, since glipizide is highly protein bound and hepatic biotransformation is the predominant route of elimination, the pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacody namics of glipizide may be altered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. In mice no glipizide or me tabolites were detectable autoradiographically in the brain or spinal cord of males or females, nor in the fetuses of pregnant females. I n another study , however, very small amounts of radioactivity were detected in the fetuses of rats given labelled drug. INDICATIONS AND USAGE GLIPIZIDE EXTENDED -RELEASE is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with ty pe 2 diabetes mellitus. CONTRAINDICATIONS Glipizide to glipizide or any excipients in the TS tablets. 2. Ty pe 1 diabetes mellitus , diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma. This condition should be treated with insulin. WARNINGS SPECIAL WARNING ON INCREASED RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALIT Y: The administration of oral hypoglycemic drugs has been reported to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality as compared to treatment with diet alone or diet plus insulin. This warning is based on the study conducted by the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP), a long -term prospective clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of glucose -lowering drugs in preventing or delaying vascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes. The study involved 823 patients who were ran domly assigned to one of four treatment groups ( Diabetes , 19, SUPP. 2: 747 -830, 1970).5UGDP reported that patients treated for 5 to 8 years with diet plus a fixed dose of tolbutamide (1.5 grams per day) had a rate of cardiovascular mortality approximately 2\u00bdtimes that of patients treated with diet alone. A significant increase in total mortality was not observed, but the use of tolbutamide was discontinued based on the increase in cardiovascular mortality, thus limiting the opportunity for the study to sh ow an increase in overall mortality. Despite controversy regarding the interpretation of these results, the findings of the UGDP study provide an adequate basis for this warning. The patient should be informed of the potential risks and advantages of glipi zide and of alternative modes of therapy. Although only one drug in the sulfonylurea class (tolbutamide) was included in this study, it is prudent from a safety standpoint to consider that this warning may also apply to other oral hypoglycemic drugs in th is class, in view of their close similarities in mode of action and chemical structure. As with any other non -deformable material, caution should be used when administering glipizide extended -release tablets in patients with preexisting severe gastrointes tinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive sy mptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of another drug in this non -deformable sustained release formulation. PRECAUTIONS Genera l Macrovascular Outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with GLIPIZIDE EXTENDED -RELEASE or any other anti - diabetic drug. Renal and Hepatic Disease: The pharmacokinetics and/or pharmaco dynamics of glipizide may be affected in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. I f hypogly cemia should occur in such patients, it may be prolonged and appropriate management should be instituted. GI Disease: Markedly reduced GI retention times of the glipizide extended -release tablets may influence the pharmacokinetic profile and hence the clinical efficacy of the drug. Hypoglycemia: All sulfony lurea drugs are capable of producing severe hy pogly cemia. Proper patient selection, dosage, and instr uctions are important to avoid hy pogly cemic episodes. Renal or hepatic insufficiency may affect the disposition of glipizide and the latter may also diminish gluconeogenic capacity , both of which increase the risk of serious hy pogly cemic reactions. Elderly , debilitated or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency are particularly susceptible to the of glucose -lowering drugs. Hy pogly cemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly , and in people who are ta king beta -adrenergic blocking drugs. Hy pogly cemia is more likely to occur when caloric intake is deficient, after severe or prolonged exercise, when alcohol is ingested, or when more than one glucose -lowering 6drug is used. Therapy with a combination of glu cose-lowering agents may increase the potential for hy pogly cemia. Loss of Control of Blood Glucose: When a patient stabilized on any diabetic regimen is exposed to stress such as fever, trauma, infection, or surgery , a loss of control may occur. At such times, it may be necessary to discontinue glipizide and administer insulin. The effectiveness of any oral hy pogly cemic drug, including glipizide, in lowering blood glucose to a desired level decreases in many patients over a period of time, which may be du e to progression of the severity of the diabetes or to diminished responsiveness to the drug. This phenomenon is known as secondary failure, to distinguish it from primary failure in which the drug is ineffective in an individual patient when first given. Adequate adjustment of dose and adherence to diet should be assessed before classify ing a patient as a secondary failure. Hemolytic Anemia: Treatment of patients with glucose 6 -phosphate dehy drogenase (G6PD) deficiency with sulfony lurea agents can lead to hemoly tic anemia. Because GLIPIZIDE EXTENDED -RELEASE belongs to the class of sulfony lurea agents, caution should be used in patients with G6PD deficiency and a non -sulfony lurea alternative should be considered. I n post marketing reports, hemoly tic anemi a has also been reported in patients who did not have known G6PD deficiency . Laboratory Tests: Blood and urine glucose should be monitored periodically . Measurement of hemoglobin A 1C may be useful. Information for Patients: Patients should be informed th at glipizide extended -release tablets should be swallowed whole. Patients should not chew, divide or crush tablets. Patients should not be concerned if they occasionally notice in their stool something that looks like a tablet. I n the glipizide extended -release tablets, the medication is contained within a nonabsorbable shell that has been specially designed to slowly release the drug so the body can absorb it. When this process is completed, the empty tablet is eliminated from the body . Patients should be informed of the potential risks and advantages of glipizide extended -release tablets and of alternative modes of therapy . They should also be informed about the importance of adhering to dietary instructions, of a regular exercise program, and of regular testing of urine and/or blood glucose. The risks of hy pogly cemia, its sy mptoms and treatment, and conditions that predispose to its development should be explained to patients and responsible family members. Primary and secondary failure also should be ex plained. Physician Counseling Information for Patients : In initiating treatment for ty pe 2 diabetes, diet should be emphasized as the primary form of treatment. Caloric restriction and weight loss are essential in the obese diabetic patient. Proper dieta ry management alone may be effective in controlling the blood glucose and sy mptoms of hypergly cemia. The importance of regular phy sical activity should also be stressed, and 7cardiovascular risk factors should be identified and corrective measures taken whe re possible. Use of glipizide extended -release or other antidiabetic medications must be viewed by both the physician and patient as a treatment in addition to diet and not as a substitution or as a convenient mechanism for avoiding dietary restraint. Furt hermore, loss of blood glucose control on diet alone may be transient, thus requiring only short -term administration of glipizide extended - release or other antidiabetic medications. Maintenance or discontinuation of glipizide extended - release or other anti diabetic medications should be based on clinical judgment using regular clinical and laboratory evaluations Drug Interactions: The hy pogly cemic action of sulfony lureas potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory agents and other drugs that are lates, -adrenergic blocking agents. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving glipizide, the patient should be observed closely for hy pogly cemia. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving glipizide, the patient should be observed closely for loss of control. In vitro binding studies with human serum proteins indicate that glipizide binds differently than tolbutamide and does not interact with salicy late or dicumarol. However, caution must be exercised in extrapolating these findings to the clinical situation and in the use of glipizide with these drugs. Certain drugs tend to produce hy pergly cemia and may lead to loss of control. These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, sy mpathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, an d isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving glipizide, the patient should be closely observed for loss of control. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving glipizide, the patient should be observed closely for hy pogly cemia. A potential interaction between oral miconazole and hy pogly cemic agents leading to severe hypogly cemia has been reported. Whether this interaction also occurs with the intravenous, topical, or vaginal preparations of miconazole is not known. T he effect of concomitant administration of Diflucan\u00ae (fluconazole) and glipizide tablets has been demonstrated in a placebo -controlled crossover study in normal volunteers. All subjects received glipizide tablets alone and following treatment with 100 mg o f Diflucan\u00ae as a single daily oral dose for 7 days. The mean percentage increase in the glipizide tablet AUC after fluconazole administration was 81%). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: A twenty month study in rats and an eighteen month study in mice at doses up to 75 times the maximum human dose revealed no evidence of drug -related carcinogenicity . Bacterial and in vivo mutagenicity tests were uniformly negative. Studies in rats of both sexes at doses up to 75 times the human dose showed no effects on fertility . Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C: Glipizide was found to be mildly fetotoxic in rat reproductive studies at all dose levels (5 -50mg/kg). This fetotoxicity has been similarly noted with other sulfony lureas, s uch as tolbutamide and tolazamide. The effect is perinatal and believed 8to be directly related to the pharmacologic (hy pogly cemic) action of glipizide. I n studies in rats and rabbits no teratogenic effects were found. There are no adequate and well control led studies in pregnant women. Glipizide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Because recent information suggests that abnormal blood -glucose levels during pregnancy are associated with a higher incidence of congenital abnormalities, many experts recommend that insulin be used during pregnancy to maintain blood -glucose levels as close to normal as possible. Nonteratogenic Effects: Prolonged severe hy pogly cemia (4 to 10 days) has been repo rted in neonates born to mothers who were receiving a sulfony lurea drug at the time of delivery . This has been reported more frequently with the use of agents with prolonged half -lives. I f glipizide is used during pregnancy , it should be discontinued at le ast one month before the expected delivery date. Nursing Mothers: Although it is not known whether glipizide is excreted in human milk, some sulfony lurea drugs are known to be excreted in human milk. Because the potential for hypogly cemia in nursing infan ts may exist, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. If the drug is discontinued and if diet alone is inadequate for controlling blood glucose, insu lin therapy should be considered. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established. Geriatric Use: Of the total number of patients in clinical studies of glipizide extended -release tablets, 33 percent were 65 and over. Approx imately 1-2days longer were required to reach steady -state in the elderly . (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) There were no overall differences in effectiveness or safety between younger and older patients, but greater sensitivity of some individuals cannot be ruled out. As such, it should be noted that elderly , debilitated or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency , are particularly susceptible to the hy pogly cemic action of glucose - lowering drugs. H ypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly . In addition, in elderly , debilitated or malnourished patients, and patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, the initial and maintenance dosing should be conservative to avoid hy pogly cemic r eactions. ADVERSE REACTIONS In U.S. controlled studies the frequency of serious adverse experiences reported was very low and causal relationship has not been established. The 580 patients from 31 to 87 years of age who received glipizide extended -release tablets in doses from 5 mg to 60 mg in both controlled and open trials were included in the evaluation of adverse experiences. All adverse experiences reported were tabulated independently of their possible causal relation to medication.9Hypoglycemia: See PRECAUTIONS and OVERDOSAGE sections. Only 3.4% of patients receiving glipizide extended -release tablets had hy cemia measurement <60 sy mptoms believed to be associated with hypogly cemia. I n a comparative efficacy study of glipizide extended -release tablets and glipizide tablets, hy pogly cemia occurred rarely with an incidence of less than 1% with both drugs. In double -blind, placebo -controlled studies the adverse experiences reported with an incidence of 3% or more in glipizide extended -release tablet -treated patients GLIPIZIDE EXTENDED (%) (N=278) (N=69) Adverse Effect Asthenia 10.1 13.0 Headache 8.6 8.7 Dizziness 6.8 5.8 Nervousness 3.6 2.9 Tremor 3.6 0.0 Diarrhea 5.4 0.0 Flatulence 3.2 1.4 The following adverse experiences occurred with an incidence of less than 3% in glipizide extended -release tablet -treated patients: Respiratory -rhinitis Special senses -blurred vis ion Urogenital -polyuria Other adverse experiences occurred with an incidence of less than 1% in glipizide extended - release tablet -treated patients: Body as a whole -chills Nervous sy conjuncti vitis and retinal hemorrhage Urogenital -dysuria Although these adverse experiences occurred in patients treated with glipizide extended -release tablets, a causal relationship to the medication has not been established in all cases. There have been rare r eports of gastrointestinal irritation and gastrointestinal bleeding with use of another drug in this non -deformable sustained release formulation, although causal relationship to the drug is uncertain. Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse even ts have been reported in post -marketing surveillance: Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain Hepatobiliary : Cholestatic and hepatocellular forms of liver injury accompanied by jaundice have been reported rarely in association with glipizide; glipizide extended -release tablets should be discontinued if this occurs. The following are adverse experiences reported with immediate release glipizide and other sulfony lureas, but have not with sulfony lureas. I n the mouse, glipizide pretreatment did not cause an accumulation of acetaldehy de after ethanol administration. Clinical experie nce to date has shown that glipizide has an extremely low incidence of disulfiram -like alcohol reactions. Endocrine Reactions: Cases sy ndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SI ADH) secretion have been reported with glipizide and other sulfony lureas. Laboratory Tests: The pattern of laboratory test abnormalities observed with glipizide was similar to that for other sulfony lureas. Occasional mild to moderate elevations of SGOT, L DH, alkaline phosphatase, BUN and creatinine wer e noted. One case of jaundice was reported. The relationship of these abnormalities to glipizide is uncertain, and they have rarely been associated with clinical sy mptoms. OVERDOSAGE There is no well -documented experience with glipizide extended -release t ablets overdosage in humans. There have been no known suicide attempts associated with purposeful overdosing with glipizide extended -release tablets. I n nonclinical studies the acute oral toxicity of glipizide was 11extremely low in all species tested (L D50greater than 4 g/kg). Overdosage of consciousness or neurologic findings should be treated aggressively with oral glucose and adjustments in drug dosage and/or meal patterns. Close monitoring should continue until the physician is assured that the patient is out of danger. Severe hy pogly cemic reactions with coma, seizure, or other neurological impairment occur infrequently , but constitute medical emergenci es requiring immediate hospitalization. I f hypogly cemic coma is diagnosed or suspected, the patient should be given rapid intravenous injection of concentrated (50%) glucose solution. This should be followed by a continuous infusion of a more dilute (10%) glucose solution at a rate that will maintain the blood glucose at a level above 100 mg/dL. Patients should be closely monitored for a minimum of 24 to 48 hours since hy pogly cemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery . Clearance of glipizide from plas ma may be prolonged in persons with liver disease. Because of the extensive protein binding of glipizide, dialy sis is unlikely to be of benefit. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of diabetes mellitus with glip izide extended -release pogly cemic agent. Gly cemic control should be monitored with hemoglobin A 1C and/or blood -glucose levels to determine the minimum effective dose for the patient; to detect primary failure, i.e., inadequate loweri ng of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication; and to detect secondary failure, i.e., loss of an adequate blood -glucose -lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness. Home blood -glucose monitoring may also provide useful in formation to the patient and phy sician. Short -term administration of glipizide extended -release tablets may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually controlled on diet. In general, glipizide extended -release tablets sh ould be given with breakfast. Recommended Dosing: The usual starting dose of glipizide extended -release tablets as initial therapy is 5 mg per day , given with breakfast. Those patients who may be more sensitive to hypogly cemic drugs may be started at a lo wer dose. Dosage adjustment should be based on laboratory measures of gly cemic control. While fasting blood -glucose levels generally reach steady -state following initiation or change in glipizide extended -release tablets dosage, a single fasting glucose d etermination may not accurately reflect the response to therapy . In most cases, hemoglobin A 1C level measured at three month intervals is the preferred means of monitoring response to therapy . Hemoglobin A 1C should be measured as glipizide extended -releas e tablets therapy is initiated and repeated approximately three months later. I f the result of this test suggests that gly cemic control over the preceding three months was inadequate, the glipizide extended -release tablets dose may be increased. Subsequent dosage adjustments should be made on the basis of hemoglobin A 1C levels measured at three month intervals. I f no improvement is seen after three months of therapy with a higher dose, the previous dose should be resumed. Decisions which utilize fasting blo od 12glucose to adjust glipizide extended -release tablets therapy should be based on at least two or more similar, consecutive values obtained seven day s or more after the previous dose adjustment. Most patients will be controlled with 5 mg to 10 mg taken o nce daily . However, some patients may require up to the maximum recommended daily dose of 20 mg. While the gly cemic control of selected patients may improve with doses which exceed 10 mg, clinical studies conducted to date have not demonstrated an addition al group average reduction of hemoglobin A 1C beyond what was achieved with the 10 mg dose. Based on the results of a randomized crossover study , patients receiving immediate release glipizide may be switched safely to glipizide extended -release tablets on ce-a-day at the nearest equivalent total daily dose. Patients receiving immediate release glipizide also may be titrated to the appropriate dose of glipizide extended -release tablets starting with 5 mg once daily . The decision to switch to the nearest equi valent dose or to titrate should be based on clinical judgment. In elderly patients, debilitated or malnourished patients, and patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, the initial and maintenance dosing should be conservative to avoid hypogly cemi c reactions (see PRECAUTIONS section). Combination Use: When adding other blood -glucose -lowering agents to glipizide extended - release tablets for combination therapy , the agent should be initiated at the lowest recommended dose, and patients should be observed carefully for hy pogly cemia. Refer to the product information supplied with the oral agent for additional information. When adding glipizide extended -release tablets to other blood -glucose -lowering agents, glipizide extended -release tablets can be initiated at 5 mg. Those patients who may be more sensitive to hypogly cemic drugs may be started at a lower dose. Titration should be based on clinical judgment. Patients Receiving Insulin: As with other sulfony lurea -class patients wi th stable ty pe2 diabetes receiving insulin may be transferred safely to treatment with glipizide extended -release tablets. When transferring patients from insulin to glipizide extended -release tablets, the following general guidelines should be considered : For patients whose daily insulin requirement is 20 units or less, insulin may be discontinued and glipizide extended -release tablets therapy may begin at usual dosages. Several day s should elapse between titration steps. For patients whose daily insuli n requirement is greater than 20 units, the insulin dose should be reduced by 50% and glipizide extended -release tablets therapy may begin at usual dosages. Subsequent reductions in insulin dosage should depend on individual patient response. Several days should elapse between titration steps.13During the insulin withdrawal period, the patient should test urine samples for sugar and ketone bodies at least three times daily . Patients should be instructed to contact the prescriber immediately if these tests a re abnormal. I n some cases, especially when the patient has been receiving greater than 40 units of insulin daily , it may be advisable to consider hospitalization during the transition period. Patients Receiving Other Oral Hypoglycemic Agents: As with oth er sulfony lurea -class hypogly cemics, no transition period is necessary when transferring patients to glipizide extended - release tablets. Patients should be observed carefully (1-2weeks) for hy pogly cemia when being transferred -life sulfony lureas (e.g., chlorpropamide) to glipizide extended - release tablets due to potential overlapping of drug effect.
