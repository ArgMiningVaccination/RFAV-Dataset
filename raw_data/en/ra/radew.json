Prof. Manuel Elk in Patarroyo SUMMARY vi Summary The increase of Plasmodium falciparum 's drug resistance and the resurgence of Mycobacterium ulcerans disease through environmental changes aggravate he alth problems caused by these pathogens. Buruli ulcer, caused by M. ulcerans , is after tuberculosis and leprosy the third most common mycobacterial human infection and the most p oorly understood of these three diseases. It is characterized by chronic, necrotizi ng ulceration of subcutaneous tissues and the is a broa d antigenic overlap between mycobacterial species, which complicates the analysis of adaptive immune responses and hampers the development of specific sero-diagnostic tests for M. ulcerans in areas where BCG vaccination has been implemented and tuberculosis i s endemic. In an effort to identify immunodominant antigens of M. ulcerans, we have generated panels of monoclonal antibodies from mice immunized with this pathogen. Cross-reactivity studies with other mycobacterial species performed by Western blot and immunofluorescence assays have identified immunodominant epitopes with a limited c ross-species distribution (18kDa and the 34-37kDa proteins). In contrast, the majority o f antigens were spread widely amongst different mycobacterial species. One set of non-cro ssreactive monoclonal antibodies recognized an 18kDa protein of M. ulcerans that is associated with the cell-wall fraction, and expressed in Buruli ulcer lesions . The target protein was identified by mass- spectroscopy as the M. ulcerans orthologue of the M. leprae 18kDa small heat shock protein, which has no orthologues in the genomes of M. bovis and M. tuberculosis . Human anti-18kDa small heat shock protein antibodies were found in the serum of all Buruli ulcer patients tested, but not in sera from Europeans vol unteers and only rarely in sera from Africans living in Buruli ulcer non-endemic regions . Reactivity of sera from a proportion of people living in a Buruli ulcer endem ic area and in contact with Buruli ulcer patients indicated that an 18kDa small heat shock p rotein-based serological test is suitable to detect exposure to M. ulcerans. Since M. ulcerans shows only very limited genetic diversity, standar d multi-locus sequence typing of housekeeping genes is not a suit able tool for molecular epidemiological SUMMARY vii analysis of Buruli ulcer. Among the monoclonal anti bodies exhibiting broad inter-species cross-reactivity, one group recognized the M. ulcerans orthologue of mycobacterial laminin-binding protein. DNA sequence analysis demo nstrated that the corresponding hupB gene from M. ulcerans isolates of diverse geographical origin exhibited considerable diversity based both on insertional/deletional poly morphism and on single base exchanges. Dominance of non-conservative exchanges was indicat ive of a diversifying selection pressure. Sequences analysis of a set of such varia ble genes may develop into a new tool for genetic fingerprinting of isolates. There is great need to identify new malaria vaccine and drug targets. Monoclonal antibodies were used to characterize a novel conser ved protein of P. falciparum designated D13. Western blot analysis demonstrated that D13 is stage-specif ically expressed during schizogony in asexual blood stages of the parasite. It has a functionally essential role in parasite biology, since anti-D13 monoclonal antibodies have parasite growth inhibito ry activity. The D13 protein may represent a suitable target for a malaria vaccine design. Immunofluorescence analysis with monoclonal antibod ies specific for glyceraldehydes-3- phosphate sh owed that pfGAPDH and pfAldolase colocalise in early stages of both liver and asexual blood stage parasite development. However, during schizogony, unlike pfA ldolase, pfGAPDH was enriched in the apical region of the parasites. In addition, We stern blot analyses demonstrate that pfGAPDH is in both the membrane-containing pellet a nd supernatant fractions. These results have that pfGAPDH exerts non-glycolytic function(s) in P. falciparum ; including possibly role in vesicular transport and biogenesis of apical organelles. This data together with the limited ami no acid sequence identity with human GAPDH suggest that the pfGAPDH could be a promising safe target for drug treatment.

Introduction 1 INTRODUCTION Chapter 1 CHAPTER 1. Introduction 2 Buruli ulcer, caused by the environmental pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans, is disease of skin and soft tissue with the potential to leave sc arring and deformities. The causative organism is from the bacterial family which causes tuberculosis and leprosy, and produces a dermonecrotic toxin. Most patients are children w ho live in rural sub-Saharan Africa; however, healthy people of all age, race and socio- economic class are susceptible. 1.1 History and epidemiology Buruli ulcer is the third most important mycobacter ial disease after tuberculosis and leprosy in humid tropical countries of West Africa 1. The definitive description of M. ulcerans was published in 1948 by MacCallum et al . where they reported 6 cases of an unusual skin infection in Australia, caused by a my cobacterium that could only be cultured in L\u00f6wenstein-Jensen medium when the incubation tem perature was set lower than for M. tuberculosis 2. Before, large skin ulcers almost certainly caused by M. ulcerans were previously described in Uganda in 1897 by Sir Alber t Cook, and by Kleinschmidt in northeast Congo during the 1920s 3, however these cases were not published in the med ical literature. Prior to 1980, M. ulcerans infections were reported in several African countr ies: Congo, Uganda, Gabon, Nigeria, Cameroon and Ghana 4. The term \"Buruli ulcer\" was chosen by the Uganda Buruli Group after they studied the clin ic-pathological and epidemiological aspects of the disease extensively in a county call ed Buruli, near Lake Kyoga 5. Since the 1980s, Buruli ulcer has emerged as a seri ous public health problem in an increasing number of countries. West Africa thus fa r appears to be the most affected area, especially C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Benin 6 and Ghana 7. New foci were discovered recently in Togo 8, Angola 9 and Guinea 4. In Ghana, the overall crude prevalence rate was 2 0.7 per 100,000 persons in 1999, but rose to 150.8 per 100,000 in t he most disease-endemic district 7. In southern Benin, Buruli ulcer had a higher detection rate (21.5 per 100,000 per year) than leprosy (13.4 per 100,000) and tuberculosis (20.0 p er 100,000)6. In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, over 15,000 cases were recorded between 1978 and 1999 10 . In West Africa, about 70% of affected individuals a re children under the age of 15 years, and between 20 to 25 percent of those with healed l esions are left with disabilities. CHAPTER 1. Introduction 3 Several other countries outside Africa are also end emic such as rural areas of Papua New Guinea, Australia, Malaysia, French Guyana and Mexi co. French Guiana has the highest prevalence of Buruli ulcer cases among Latin Americ an countries with 193 cases reported, whereas only 8 cases were registered in Peru, 8 in Mexico 11 , 1 in Bolivia and 1 in Suriname 12 . Since the first Australian cases reported in 1948, until the 1990s, one or two cases have occurred annually. In the 1990s, however, incidence of the disease increased suddenly with the development of new foci on Phillip Island and t he Frankston/Langwarrin district south of suburban Melbourne. There are now 20-30 cases pe r annum, a 10-fold increase over the past 15 years 12 . Few cases have been reported in non-endemic areas in North America and Europe as a consequence of international travel 10,13 .The worldwide distribution of Buruli ulcer disease is shown in figure 1. Figure 1 . Countries reporting Buruli ulcer (Source: Johnson et al., . 2005) 1.2 Causative Organism M. ulcerans , together with the other mycobacteria, corynebacte ria and nocordia form a monophyletic taxon within the family of actinomycet es 13 . The slowly growing M. ulcerans belongs to a group of mycobacteria that are potenti ally pathogenic for humans and animals. These are sometimes called \"opportunistic mycobacte ria\" or \"occasional pathogens\" to CHAPTER 1. Introduction 4 distinguish them from strict pathogens. Most specie s belonging to this group are widespread in the environment and may become pathog enic under specific circumstances 14 . The generation time of M. ulcerans in vitro is 20 hours, as is the case for the M. tuberculosis -complex organisms, and a positive culture requires an incubation time of 6 to 8 weeks 3. M. ulcerans is possibly the only pathogenic mycobacterium spec ies that does not have a significant intracellular existence 15 . However, recent studies showed that M. ulcerans proceeds through an initial phase where bacilli ar e internalized by phagocytic cells, like most mycobacterial species. The transit ion to a second phase, where the bacteria are extracellular, occurs by action of mycolactone 16 . The best growing rates are achieved at low temperature (32\u00baC) on Lowenstein-Jensen medium. It grows best in microaerophilic conditions 17 . Figure 2. Acid fast bacilli ( M. ulcerans ) in a smear taken from an ulcer. The bacteria can be clearly seen as red clumps on a blue background. Oil immersion microscopy (1000x). 1.2.1 . M. ulcerans toxin The pathogenesis of M. ulcerans is closely associated with expression of a macroli de toxin, mycolactone. Mycolactone was identified by two-dime nsional nuclear magnetic resonance spectral analysis as a polyketide-derived 12-membered ring m acrolide (C 44 H70 O9) (fig. 3). The mycolactone is a major component of acetone-sol uble lipids (ASL) present in an CHAPTER 1. Introduction 5 organic extract from an M. ulcerans sterile filtrate. The toxin was named mycolactone to reflect its mycobacterial source and chemical structure. Mycolactone isolated from M. ulcerans cultures has been shown to be immunosuppressive and cytotoxic in vitro , as addition of mycolactone to macrophages and fib roblast has effects on the cytoskeleton and leads to cell growt h arrest in the G 0/G 1 stage and apoptosis 15 . Injection of mycolactone into the dermis of guine a pigs is sufficient to induce ulcers 18 , and natural mycolactone deficient mutants failed to induce ulcers in these animals 15 . Mycolactones induce cell death by apoptosis, whic h may explain the absence of an inflammatory immune response despite extensive t issue damage 18 . Until now, no cell receptor has been found to expla in the cascade of effects induced by mycolactones 19 . The lipid toxin mycolactone is synthesized by the giant polyketide synthases, which are encoded by three very large an d homologous genes, harboured in the 174-kb virulence plasmid pMUM001 20 . In contrast to the wild type M. ulcerans, mycolactone negative mutants fail to colonize the salivary glands of water insects, suggesting that t hese molecules may play a role in the ability of M. ulcerans to colonize reservoir species 15,21 . Figure 3. Mycolactone is composed of a 12-membered ring to which two polyketide- derived side chains (R1 and R2) are attached. (Sour ce: George, et al., , Science 1999). CHAPTER 1. Introduction 6 1.3 Pathology and Clinical Presentation 1.3.1 Clinical features A papule or a firm nodule indicates the first stage of the disease. A papule is defined as a painless, raised skin lesion surrounded by reddened skin (Fig. 4a). The nodule is characterized as an extended lesion from the skin i nto the subcutaneous tissue. It is usually painless as a papule but may be itchy while the sur rounding skin may be discoloured compared to adjacent areas (Fig.4b). Occasionally, some patients develop extensive indurate lesions or plaques that are painless and p resent irregular edges (Fig.4c). In the second stage, ulceration takes place on the floor o f the ulcer which displays a white cotton wool-like appearance in the necrotic slough (Fig.4d ). Many acid-fast bacilli are present in the slough, and the necrosis can extend away from t he site where M. ulcerans is placed. The ulcer is usually painless, unless there is a se condary bacterial infection. Complications include loss of organs such as the eye and breast, amputation of limbs and other permanent disabilities 22,23 . In advanced cases the bone may also become involv ed 23 . Papule (a) Nodule (b) CHAPTER 1. Introduction 7 Plaque (c) Ulcerative form (d) Figure 4. Clinical forms of Buruli ulcer. (Source: Portaels F. Johnson P, Meyers WM editors, 2001. World Health Organisation) 1.3.2 Histopathology Progressive M. ulcerans infection causes characteristic tissue changes. Th e first stage of the disease (papule, nodule) presents coagulative n ecrosis of the lower dermis and subcutaneous fat. The organisms are present in clum ps or in smaller microcolonies in the centre of the lesion. In these early lesions there is little cellular reaction despite the presence of large clumps of extracellular organisms and there is no evidence of an inflammatory response or the development of granulo mas. The second stage of the disease (ulcerative form) produces granulomatous reactions with epithelioid macrophages, a variable numbers of giant cells of the Langhans typ e, and relatively few acid-fast organisms 24 . As the disease progresses, all elements of the sk in are affected including nerves and blood vessels. Later, during the natural course of the disease, the immunosuppressive effect of the toxin is somehow ov ercome by the host, allowing then immunity to develop and healing to commence. This may account for the observation that patients with active lesions are often unresponsive to M. ulcerans -derived antigens (burulin) on skin testing 25 . Later, during the healing phase, characterized by the appearance of g ranulomas, there is conversion to a positive burulin test indicating that a specific ce llular response develops. CHAPTER 1. Introduction 8 1.4 Diagnosis In endemic areas, the clinical diagnosis of ulcerat ing lesions by experienced clinicians is straightforward. The painless ulcer with undermined edges and a necrotic slough can be recognised easily. Patients with Buruli ulcer have no clinically detectable lymphadenitis, no systemic symptoms such a fever or malaise sugges ting a staphylococcal or streptococcal infection. Since early and healing lesions may be c onfused with other skin diseases endemic in tropical areas, probable cases defined c linically have to be confirmed. Commonly used diagnostic laboratory tests are: i) d etection of mycobacteria by Ziehl- Neelsen (ZN) staining, a technique which lacks sens itivity and specificity, ii) culture of M. ulcerans , which may take several months, iii) detection of characteristic histopathological changes in excised tissue, iv) detection of M. ulcerans DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR); PCR is a rapid, sensitive and specific diagn ostic method but requires advanced technical expertise and is not always available in developing countries. A dry-reagent- based PCR formulation using (IS2404 TaqMa n) ulcerans DNA by monitoring the real-time amplification of IS2404 represent modifications of the conventional IS2404 PCR method 27 . Real-time PCR offers the possibility to measure t he starting amount of target DNA in clinical specimens and other samples, thus providing a measure of mycobacterial burden as well 28 . Although molecular biological methods are quickly a ble to confirm the clinical diagnosis, high laboratory standards are needed to avoid the c ontamination risk and thus false positive results. While swabs can be taken to test the undef ined edges of ulcerative lesions, it is much more problematic to take punch biopsies from p re-ulcerative lesions, since this technique promotes the spread of the mycobacterium. The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Buruli U lcer Initiative has asked the research community to develop a simple and rapid di agnostic test which could be used to identify patients early during the course of the in fection, so that the detection rate of patients with Buruli ulcer could be improved and pr eventive therapy and early treatment options could be fully implemented. Humoral immuni ty has been studied for the diagnosis of the disease, since serum samples from infected i ndividuals from different regions of Buruli ulcer endemicity have shown high titers of a ntibodies to M. ulcerans antigens. CHAPTER 1. Introduction 9 Three M. ulcerans antigens of 70, 38/36 and 5 kDa of M. ulcerans culture filtrate have been commonly recognized Buruli ulcer patient an tibodies 29,30 . However, sera of household contacts and tuberculosis patients from e ndemic areas showed cross-reactivity to M. ulcerans antigens 31 . Recent studies showed that IgM antibody responses from Buruli ulcer patients recognized antigens from M. ulcerans culture filtrate. A total of 84.8% of the Buruli ulcer patients present IgM antibody response s, whereas only 4.5% of household contacts exhibited such responses32 . The publication of the genomic sequence of M. ulcerans will be soon available and could assist the develo pment of a non-invasive serodiagnostic assay based on M. ulcerans -specific antigens. 1.5 Treatment 1.5.1 Surgery The standard treatment is limited to surgical excis ion, followed by skin grafting, but this intensive therapy and the required need for long-te rm care results in great economic impact on affected communities. The aim of the treatment i s to halt the infection and repair existing damage. After the early excision of small pre-ulcerative lesions (papules and nodules) the skin can often be closed requiring no skin grafting. Necrotic ulcers are easily recognised and should be carefully removed, with ex cision extending into healthy tissue, to prevent persistent subcutaneous infection from resi dual bacilli 10 . Relapse after surgery may occur in 5%-47% of the cases 33,34 . Early excision can prevent development of the lar ge and disfiguring ulcers often associated with persistent deformity after healing 35 . 1.5.2 Drug treatment Treatment of M. ulcerans infections with antimycobacterial agents has gener ally been disappointing, especially in extensive ulcers. The only published controlled trials in humans suggest that both clofazamine 36 and cotrimoxazole 37 are ineffective and that rifampicin and dapsone combined have limited effica cy for ulcers 38 . Anecdotal reports of antibiotic administration have been discouraging, a nd it has been postulated that antibiotics fail to penetrate M. ulcerans lesions because of the extensive necrosis caused b y CHAPTER 1. Introduction 10 mycolactone. M. ulcerans has been shown in vitro to be susceptible to rifampicin, some amino glycosides, macrolides and quinolones 39,40 . M. ulcerans was susceptible to the same drugs in the mouse footpad model 41 , where the size of the mouse's footpad lesions tre ated with rifampicin and amikacin together for 12 weeks decreased progressively, reducing the mean CFU counts of M. ulcerans while no relapse occurred 42 . Recent studies suggest that a combination of anti-mycobacterial antibiotics that include rifampicin and either streptomycin or amikacin for 4 weeks are able to ki ll M. ulcerans in human lesions. In this study, no lesion became enlarged during antibiotic treatment and most became smaller 43 . Recent, successful results have encouraged the WHO to recommend the use of this combination for the treatment of small early M. ulcerans lesions. The treatment (duration) and the doses of the antibiotics depend of the size of the lesion and other complications. For example, small early lesions should be treated after surgery with this combination for 4 weeks, and ulcerative plaque or oedematous forms sh ould be treated at least 4 weeks with antibiotics before and after surgery 44 . 1.5.3 Heat treatment One study following eight patients showed that cont inuous local heating to 40\u00b0 C for 4-6 weeks promotes healing even without excision. In a ddition, heat treatment may improve blood flow, antibiotic penetration and phagocytosis45 . 1.6 Transmission The exact mode of transmission of M. ulcerans is an enigma. Epidemiological studies demonstrated that M. ulcerans is strongly associated with swampy areas 21,23,46-50 . Changes in the environment, such as the construction of irr igation systems and dams, seem to play a role in the resurgence of the disease. In Nigeria, infections have emerged when a small stream was dammed to make an artificial lake 51 . In Phillip Island, Australia, a recent outbreak was associated with the formation of a swa mpy area and the outbreak stopped once the swamp's drainage was improved 52 . M. ulcerans is thought to reach the human dermis through wound s or skin abrasions via contact with M. ulcerans -containing environmental reservoirs. In addition, M. ulcerans CHAPTER 1. Introduction 11 was detected in aquatic insects obtained from endem ic areas in Africa by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)48 , leading to the possibility that M. ulcerans may be transmitted by bites of the insect order Hemiptera (fig 5). Figure 5. Semi-Aquatic Hemiptera positive for M. ulcerans by PCR . The top row is Macrocoris sp ., 1.0 body length (Naucoridae), and the bottom row is Appassus sp ., about 2.5 cm body lengths (Belastomatidae). Ventral view (A, C) and dorsal view (B, D) (Source: Johnson, et al. , PLoS Med . 2005) In support of this hypothesis, M. ulcerans has been detected in the salivary glands of Naucoris sp ., and a mouse tail exposed to this aquatic insect (Naucoridae) that had ingested a M. ulcerans -loaded prey, displayed cutaneous lesions from whic h M. ulcerans was isolated 21 . There is additional evidence that M. ulcerans DNA can be detected by PCR in other aquatic insect predators (Odonata and Coleopt era), as well as in aquatic snails, small fish and the biofilms of aquatic plants 50 . The possible mechanisms through which M. ulcerans infects water bugs that may act as hosts and vectors have been describe recently. Coel omic plasmatocytes could be the first cells of Naucoris cimicoide to be involved in the infection process, acting as shuttle cells that deliver M. ulcerans to the salivary glands. After ingestion of M. ulcerans -loaded food, the accessory salivary glands were shown to contain increasing numbers of bacilli, A . D C B CHAPTER 1. Introduction 12 indicating that these metabolically active tissues can be weakened/adopted as optimal niches for bacteria multiplication. This process is strictly dependent on mycolactone as mycolactone deficient bacilli were unavailable to e stablish long-term infectious niches. In addition, the bacilli can be rapidly detected withi n the cavity of raptorial legs. The setae of these appendages are covered by M. ulcerans -containing material resembling biofilms 53 . Other transmission pathways have been suggested in Australia: Aerosols arising from contaminated water may disseminate M. ulcerans and infect humans via the respiratory tract, or through contamination of skin lesions and minor abrasions 52,54 , however this has yet to be demonstrated. The discovery of the IS2406 and IS2606 sequences, u sed for epidemiological investigation of Buruli ulcer disease in M. liflandi 55 , was a major finding that made the interpretation of environmental studies of M. ulcerans questionable. 1.7 Prevention There is no specific vaccine against M. ulcerans , but Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e8rin (BCG) vaccination has an incomplete but significantly pro tective effect against the most severe forms of Buruli ulcer 56 . Mechanical protection of exposed areas of the bo dy, such as wearing trousers, shirt-sleeves and shoes, may also protect individuals at risk 57,58 . Additional studies to identify modifiable risk fact ors for infection and disease are needed. 1.8 Genome and bacterial population structure M. ulcerans is an emerging pathogen that seems to have evolved from M. marinum by the acquisition and concomitant loss of DNA, in a manne r analogous to the emergence of M. tuberculosis , where species diversity is being driven mainly by the activity of mobile DNA elements. A hallmark is the acquisition of a virule nce plasmid, which encodes a polyketide synthase responsible synthesis of mycolacto ne 20,49 . This plasmid has a common evolutionary origin in M. ulcerans isolates from diverse geographical locations around the world 59 . Several conventional and newly developed typing t echniques have attempted to describe the population structure of M. ulcerans and to investigate its evolution. CHAPTER 1. Introduction 13 Comparing the sequences of housekeeping genes by Mu ltilocus Sequence Typing (MLST), 6 genotypes were identified from 18 different M. ulcerans strains. The 6 genotypes were related to the 6 geographical areas of Suriname, Me xico, China/Japan, Africa and Australia (Victoria). Comparative analysis between M. marinum and M. ulcerans confirmed their relatedness, suggesting a recent divergence of M. ulcerans, by the acquisition and concomitant loss of DNA, such as the specific inser tions sequences IS2404 identi for M. ulcerans and M. marinum 61 , supporting the hypothesis that both species share common ancestors. Analysis of the 3'-terminal region of the 16S rRNA sequences of seventeen isolates of M. ulcerans from Africa, the Americas and Australia revealed t hree subgroups corresponding to the continent of origin 62 . The analysis of 12 M. ulcerans strains from Australia, Malaysia and Africa by Amp lified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) could discrimin ate just two groups of isolates: the African group and the Australian (and Malaysian) gr oup 63 . IS2404 Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RF LP) subtyping divided M. ulcerans isolates into six groups related to six geographica l regions, including Africa, Australia, Mexico, South America, Asia and Southeast Asia 64 . PCR amplification with primers based on IS2404 and GC-rich repeat sequence of 32 M. ulcerans isolates revealed 10 different patterns correspond ing to the geographic origin of the isolates. All of the 16 isolates from six diffe rent African countries produced identical profile; two different genotypes were identified in East Asia (Japan and China), Australia (Victorian and Queensland) and in Papua New Guinea (PNG I and II genotypes), the Malaysian genotype, South America (French Guiana an d Suriname with identical profile) and the Mexican genotype 65 . Eight different M. ulcerans genotypes were found by Variable Number Tandem Rep eat (VNTR) typing, including Australia, Africa, Southea st Asia, Papua New Guinea, Asia, and Mexico. This technique made it also possible to dif ferentiate between the South American strains (French Guiana and Suriname) 66 . M. ulcerans DNA which co mprises 81 protein- coding sequences. The primary function of this plas mid is mycolactone toxin production 20 . The occurrence of inter-strain variability was also discovered at the plasmid level, which CHAPTER 1. Introduction 14 was related to the mycolactone structure 67 and to frequent genetic rearrangements that render the virulence plasmid particularly unstable 59 . The clonal population structure of M. ulcerans is reflected by the fact that all genetic fingerprinting methods applied so far for M. ulcerans have resolved only a limited number of geographical types, which is particularly insuff icient to differentiate among isolates from the same area. This makes the methods unsuitab le to perform micro-epidemiological studies, where the fingerprinting of the strains is aimed at revealing transmission pathways and environmental reservoirs. The expected publicat ion of the entire M. ulcerans genome sequence in 2005 will provide an opportunity to dis criminate M. ulcerans strains by differential genomic hybridisation using microarray s. 1.9 Immune responses The immune mechanisms involved in protection agains t Buruli ulcer are largely unknown at present. Buruli ulcer disease follows an indolen t course, with a lack of immflamatory cells in lesions and predominantly negative M. ulcerans and M. bovis purified protein derivative (PPD) skin tests22 . Tuberculin or burulin skin tests switch positive over time 25 , and intralesional influx of leucocytes has been rep orted in late stages, suggesting a change in inflammatory response 29,68 . A cellular Th-1 immune response with high levels of gamma interferon (IFN- ) is regarded as crucial for the host defence again st mycobacteria 69 . In vitro immune analysis has confirmed the notion of a syst ematic T-cell anergy, as peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with active d isease or whom had recovered from surgical excision of Buruli ulcer showed significan tly reduced lymphoproliferation and IFN- production in response to stimulation with M. bovis BCG or M. ulcerans , and Th-1 down-regulation. In o ne case study, it has been shown that the development of ulcerative M. ulcerans disease is associated with a shift from the Th-1 to Th-2 phenotype 70 . Other studies have shown that IL-10 may be a key cy tokine that mediates local Th- phenotype switching within nodules and ulcers. IL-1 0 can facilitate both Th-2 and Th-1 down-regulation and is not exclusively produced by Th-2 cells 71,72 . Recently, Pr\u00e9vot et al., evaluated cytokine production by peripheral whole-b lood mononuclear cells and detected CHAPTER 1. Introduction 15 high IFN- but low IL-10 mRNA levels in nodular lesions, wher eas high IL-10 but low IFN- mRNA levels were present in ulcerative lesions. Mo reover, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- ) as expressed in lesions from both patients groups , and levels of TNF- expression were higher in nodular than in ulcerativ e lesions. TNF- could be one of the additional factors involved in the pathology of Bur uli disease, but its precise role in the development of the skin lesions remains to be eluci dated 73 . In contrast, a study of cytokine responses of peripheral whole-blood mononuclear cel ls from patients with Buruli ulcer disease in Ghana showed Th-1 down-regulation in ear ly Buruli ulcer and down-regulation reversed in later stages of the disease without ass ociation with IL-10 or IL-4 production 74 . Whether Buruli ulcer disease is associated with a s hift in T-helper subset responses is still unclear. A mouse model has been used to analyse the primary immune response against M. ulcerans 13 . Histopathological analysis of the lesions induced by M. ulcerans infections showed comparable necrosis and changes in vasculatu re and collagen degeneration as the ulcerative lesions in Buruli ulcer patients. Simila r to most mycobacterial species, M. ulcerans infection proceeds through an initial phase, where bacilli are internalized by phagocytic cells. Transition to an extracellular ph ase is caused by mycolactone, which induces host cell death within days of infection in vitro . Several lines of evidence suggest that this transient intracellular step may contribu te to the successful establishment of a chronic extracellular infection. First, the uptake of M. ulcerans by phagocytes may induce Th-1 host immune responses, ineffective for clearan ce of extracellular bacteria. Second, the suppression of TNF- production together with stimulation of inflammato ry chemokines by infected phagocytes may prevent the o rganization of granulomas able to control the infection 16 . Other evidence exists for the protective role of ac quired cellular immunity: bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e8rin vaccination is protective in mice a gainst low-dose inoculation and to some extent in man 75 . Finally, data from Benin suggest that there is a second peak of incidence in the elderly, which may correspond with declining immunity 76 . Although, cell-mediated immunity is considered to b e the major component of the host response against M. ulcerans , antibodies may also have a protective role agains t the bacteria, as the pathogen is extracellular during a ctive disease. Several studies have shown that serum samples of infected individuals from geo graphically distinct regions have high CHAPTER 1. Introduction 16 antibody titers to M. ulcerans antigens, and that antibody responses are not corr elated with disease stage 29-31 . The nature of the bacterial antigens to region wh ich these antibodies are directed is unknown, but the range of molecular wei ghts, together with the smeared appearance of the antigens suggest that both protei n and non-protein antigens are recognized 77 . In recent years, studies from several groups have c hallenged the traditional dogma that cell-mediated immunity is the major component of th e host response against M. tuberculosis , and have demonstrated that monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can modify various aspects of mycobacterial infection. The stu dies performed using mAbs against various mycobacterial epitopes suggest that certain antibodies present during infection can affect the course of the disease to benefit the hos t. One of the studies with mAbs showed that mAbs directed to arabinomannan and the carbohy drate portion of lipoarabinomannan induced protection 78,79 . The role of the antibodies in protection against Bu ruli ulcer disease has not been studied. Experimental infection of mice genetically inactiva ted in various compartments of the immune response (B lymphocytes, Th-cells, and cytol ytic T lymphocytes, cytokines, and monokines) will help to understand how host immunit y is acquired. There is no specific vaccine against M. ulcerans available, but M. bovis - BCG offers some protection, albeit short lived 75 . BCG may also provide more enduring protection ag ainst the most severe forms of Buruli 56 . Current prospects for better vaccines include impro ved or repeated BCG vaccination, attenuation of an M. ulcerans isolate, and subunit vaccines aimed at immunodomin ant protein antigens or the toxin itself 80 . CHAPTER 1. Introduction 17 10.1 Aim of the thesis 10.1.1 Buruli ulcer In May 2004, the World Health Assembly adopted a re solution on Buruli ulcer that called for research in areas that provide direct benefit t o Buruli ulcer patients: These include: 1. Studies on the transmission of Buruli ulcer 2. Development of methods for early diagnosis 3. Vaccine development Within the framework of these priorities, the aim o f this thesis was to identify, clone, recombinant express, purify and characterize immuno dominant antigens of M. ulcerans using mAbs. This approach was based on the hypothes is that some of the immunodominant antigens might be suitable targets for serological tests, and micro-epidemiology studies based on polymorphism. 10.1.2 Malaria The drive to identify novel vaccine candidates or d rug targets has in part focussed on identifying genes coding for transmembrane or secre ted proteins of Plasmodium falciparum 81,82 . Access to the sequence of the entire genome of P. falciparum has provided the opportunity to deduce the function of many of t he predicted proteins through the identification of orthologue genes and motifs in ot her organisms81 . However, a large proportion of the predicted genes have no detectabl e orthologues in other organism, reminding researchers that many aspects of parasite biology still have to be uncovered 83 . The elucidation of molecular mechanisms responsible for recognition and the subsequent invasion of erythrocytes by malaria parasites are o f central importance towards the development of new intervention strategies. Novel p roteins encoded by open reading frames designated D13 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphat e dehydrogenase (pfGAPDH) were identified functionally by an in vitro transcription-translation-translocation system. CHAPTER 1. Introduction 18 The aim of the project was to generate mAbs agains t the two recombinantly expressed proteins and to use them to describe the sub-cellul ar localisation, the stage-specific expression and the biological function, particularl y the interaction with host cell.

Mycobacterium ulcerans Laminin-Binding Protein 27 Abstract Mycobacterium ulcerans is an emerging pathogen which has diverged from M. marinum by acquisition of a virulence plasmid bearing a clu ster of genes necessary for the synthesis of the macrolide toxin mycolactone. This slow growi ng mycobacterium causes an disease characterized by chronic, necrot izing ulceration of subcutaneous tissues and the overlying skin, commonly designated as Buru li ulcer. Standard genetic fingerprinting methods including multi-locus sequen ce typing have resolved only a limited number of geographical types of M. ulcerans . We reasoned that immunodominant proteins may be under selection pressure and exhibit more di versity than most other M. ulcerans proteins. Among immunodominant proteins recognized by monoclonal antibodies, one was identified by mass spectrometric analysis as the M. ulcerans homolog of the mycobacterial laminin-binding protein. DNA sequence analysis demo nstrated that the corresponding hupB gene represents a relatively variable element with in the highly conserved genetic background of M. ulcerans . Sequence typing based on a set of such variable g enes may develop into a new tool for molecular epidemiologic al studies. Diversity was based both on insertional/deletional polymorphism and on single b ase exchanges. Dominance of non- conservative exchanges was indicative for a diversi fying selection pressure. We demonstrate that the M. ulcerans laminin-binding protein is associated with the cel l wall fraction and expressed in Buruli ulcer lesions. The Laminin-binding protein is involved in the adherence of mycobacteria to target tissues and it remains to be elucidated whether the M. ulcerans homologue plays a role in host-pathogen interaction and/or persistence in an environmental habitat. CHAPTER 2. Mycobacterium ulcerans Laminin-Binding Protein 28 Introduction Buruli ulcer is a devastating human disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans and characterized by chronic, necrotizing ulceration of subcutaneous tissues and the overlying skin (1). It has been observed in more than 30 trop ical and subtropical countries, but the main burden of disease falls on children living in sub-Saharan Africa (33). M. ulcerans is a slow-growing environmental mycobacterium, which can be cultured from infected human tissue on mycobacterial media at 30-32 C. In Burul i ulcer lesions clumps of extracellular acid-fast organisms surrounded by areas of necrosis are found in particular in subcutaneous fat tissue (8). A diffusible toxic macrolide, mycol actone, plays a key role in the massive tissue destruction seen in Buruli ulcer (7). The to xin causes mammalian cells to undergo apoptosis and its action explains at least in part that in Buruli ulcer lesions inflammatory response are poor (8). Genetic analyses suggest the recent divergence of M. ulcerans from M. marinum (30), which is well known as fish pathogen and can cause limited granulomatous skin infections in humans. One of the hallmarks of the emergence of M. ulcerans as a more severe pathogen is the acquisition of a 174-kb plasmid bearing a cluster of genes necessary for the synthesis of mycolactone (29); (31). While it is well established that proximity to mars hes and wetlands is a risk factor for contracting Buruli ulcer, the exact mode of transmi ssion of M. ulcerans is incompletely understood (1). M. ulcerans DNA has been detected in aquatic organisms and biof ilms (14); (19); (23); (28). Since many patients have ha d antecedent trauma at the site where the lesion later occurred (16), contamination of lesions by di rect contact with environmental reservoirs, such as water or mud may play an import ant role. Since M. ulcerans has been detected in the salivary glands of carnivorous aqua tic insects it has been hypothesized that it may be transmitted by water bug bites (11-13); ( 19). Currently no molecular fingerprinting method for M. ulcerans is available, that has a sufficiently high resoluti on for micro-epidemiological analyses. The apparent la ck of genetic diversity of M. ulcerans within individual geographical regions (3); (4); (2 0); (28); (32); (30) is indicative for a clonal population structure. We reasoned that immun odominant proteins may be under selection pressure and exhibit more diversity than the housekeeping genes used for multi- locus sequence typing (30). Here we demonstrate tha t the M. ulcerans homologue of the mycobacterial laminin binding protein (LBP) immunogenic and shows CHAPTER 2. Mycobacterium ulcerans Laminin-Binding Protein 29 considerable diversity based both on insertional/de letional polymorphism and on point mutations. CHAPTER 2. Mycobacterium ulcerans Laminin-Binding Protein 30 Materials and Methods Mycobacterial lysates and subcellular fractions M. ulcerans isolates from diverse geographical origins used in this study are listed in Table 1. Other mycobacterial species included in the anal smegmatis terrae (clinical isolate) and M. tuberculosis (Pasteur 14001.0001). For the preparation of lysates mycobacterial cells were heat-inactivated at 80\u00b0C for 1 hour and suspended in PBS (50mM sodium phosphate, 150mM sodium chloride, pH trypsin inhibitor (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo). 200mg of cell suspension (wet weight) was subjected to a bead beater (Mikro- Dismembrator, Braun Biotech International) treatment with 400\u00b5l of 0.1mm zirconia beads (BioSp ec Products) at 2300 rpm for 15 minutes. Beads and unbroken cells were r emoved by centrifugation at 10000g for 10 min. Protein content of the lysate was quan tified using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). For the preparation of sub cellular fractions 400 mg of heat inactivated M. ulcerans cells were suspended in 3 ml of PBS containing 0.1% Tween 80 and a proteinase inhibitor cocktail described above. Cells were broken by thre e cycles of ultrasonic disruption (Branson sonifier 250) on ice for 10 min with 50% D uty cycle and 40% output using a microtip probe. Unbroken cells were removed by cent rifugation at 3000g for 10 min. A cell wall fraction was prepared from the supernatan t by centrifugation at 27000g for 1 hour and was washed twice with PBS. The supernatant was subjected to a 100000g centrifugation for 4h; a cytosol fraction was obtai ned from the supernatant and the membrane fraction from the pellet. The membrane fra ction was washed with PBS and suspended in 0.01M ammonium bicarbonate and the sup ernatant was dialyzed ammonium bicarbonate (2). CHAPTER analysis sub-cellular fractions (1 0\u00b5g of total protein/lane) were separated on 12% SDS PAGE gels under reducing conditions in L aemmli buffer (24). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose paper (BioRad) in Tri s glycine buffer (25 mM Tris and 192 mM Glycine pH 8.3). Filters were blocked in 5% skim milk in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 overnight. Sera or monoclonal antibodies diluted in blocking solution were incubated with membranes for two hours. Bound antibodies using phosphatase conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma . Louis, Mo) as secondary antibodies and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (BCIP)-nitr o blue tetrazolium (BioRad) as substrate. Generation of monoclonal antibodies Hybridoma cell lines were generated as described ( 25) from mice immunized intraperitoneally three times with 20 \u00b5g of a lysate of the M. ulcerans strain 97-610 from Ghana formulated in the MPL +TDM adjuvant (Sigma Ch emicals, St. Louis, Mo) and immune sera were analyzed by Western blotting with the same lysates. Three days before cell fusion, mice that recognized a broad range of mycobacterial proteins received an intravenous booster injection with 20 \u00b5g of M. ulcerans lysate in PBS. Antibodies specific for M. ulcerans antigens were identified by ELISA using Immunolon 4 plates (Dynes Technologies Inc., Chantilly, Va.) coated with M. ulcerans lysate. From a panel of hybridomas generated (manuscript in preparation), t wo (designated DD2.2 and DD2.3) that secrete mAbs specific for a 27 kDa protein were ide ntified by Western blotting. Partial purification and identification of the mAb DD2.2/3 reactive protein from M. tuberculosis A lysate of M. tuberculosis cells (strain QK 228) in 8M urea was fractionated by column ilent Fractions containing the mAb DD2.2/.3-reactive protein were i dentified by Western blot analysis. Proteins in the peak fraction were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and a band of apparent molecular mass of 27 kDa was cut out and digested w ith trypsin as described (6). The protein was identified by matrix assisted laser des orption ionization-mass spectrometry CHAPTER 2. Mycobacterium digestion in low-salt, non-volatil e buffer and simplified peptide recovery as described (6). DNA extraction and sequence analysis of the M. ulcerans hup B gene For DNA extraction 100\u00b5l of a 100mg/ml lysozyme sol ution were added to a suspension of heat inactivated M. ulcerans cells in 10\u00b5l a 20mg/ml proteinase K solution were added. After incubation at 45\u00b0C overnight, the samples were subjected to bead beater treatment with 300\u00b5l of 0. 1mm zirconia beads (BioSpec Products) at 3000 rpm for 7 minutes. Beads and unbroken bacte ria were removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was transferred to fresh tubes. An equal volume of phenol-chloroform (Fluka) was added and the DNA contained in the uppe r phase was precipitated and washed with ethanol. For sequences analysis two overlapping fragments of the hupB gene were amplified by PCR using the primer combinations CGC-3' 5'-GCCAAGAAGGTGACCAA-3' and 5'- Amplificati ons were performed with the following profile: 5 min 96\u00b0C; 30 x (1min 96\u00b0C, 1 min 63\u00b0C, 1 min 72\u00b0C), 7 min Amplicons were purified a PCR product purific ation kit (Qiagen) and sequenced using genetic analyzer (Perkin-Elm er). All sequences were reconfirmed least PCR pr oducts. Nucleotide sequences The nucleotide sequences reported in this paper hav e been submitted to the GenBank with the accession numbers: AY954292 to AY954299, corres ponding to the hup 1 to 8. CHAPTER 2. Mycobacterium ulcerans Laminin-Binding Protein 33 Results Identification of an immunodominant protein of M. ulcerans that shows size variation Sera from M. ulcerans immunized mice showed reactivity with a broad range of mycobacterial antigens in Western blot analysis. Th e bands stained by all mouse sera included a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 27 kDa (data not shown). Within a panel of mAbs generated from the spleen cells of a M. ulcerans immunized mouse, two mAbs (designated DD2.2 and DD2.3) were identified, which reacted with this 27 kDa protein. Both mAbs stained one additional band with an apparent molecular mass of 32 kDa. Western blot analysis with a spectrum of M. ulcerans isolates of geographically diverse origins revealed size variation in the stai ned protein bands (Fig. 1). A mAb DD2.2/3-reactive homologue was found in whole cell lysates of all 20 mycobacterial species tested (Fig. 2). Variation in the number and size of the stained bands may reflect differences in length of the coding gen e sequences and/or in posttranslational modification. In indirect immunofluorescence assays all mycobacterial species tested were stained by mAbs DD2.2 and DD2.3 (data not shown). Identification of the M. tuberculosis homolog of the mAb DD2.2/3-reactive protein Since a completely annotated M. ulcerans genome was not available, we identified the mAb DD2.2/3-reactive homolog of M. tuberculosis instead of the M. ulcerans protein itself. A M. tuberculosis whole cell lysate was fractionated by reverse-phas e chromatography on a C8 column. Fractions were analy zed by Western blotting, and a band of apparent molecular mass of 27KDa was cut out fro m a SDS-PAGE lane loaded with the peak fraction. The excised protein was digested wit h trypsin, and the total peptide mixture was extracted and analyzed protei n as laminin binding protein hupB gene. mAbs DD2.2 and DD2.3 with a GS T-LBP fusion protein of M. tuberculosis (5) reconfirmed the identification (data not shown). CHAPTER 2. Mycobacterium ulcerans Laminin-Binding Protein 34 Localization and expression of M. ulcerans LBP The two mAb DD2.2/3-reactive bands were primarily p resent in M. ulcerans cell wall fractions (Fig. 3B), but undetectable in culture fi ltrate (Fig. 3A) and in a cytosol fraction (Fig. 3B). The M. ulcerans LBP is expressed in vivo , as it was detectable in a tissue lysate from the centre of an excised Buruli ulcer Fig. 3C). No staining was in lysates from the healthy margins of the excised tis sue . Diversity of the hupB gene in M. ulcerans isolates The hup B gene of M. ulcerans was identified by homology search in the M. ulcerans genome project database 3' and 5' untranslated regions flanking the hup B gene were used to analyze hup B gene diversity in M. ulcerans by PCR amplification and DNA sequence analysis . Significant diversity based both on insertional/del etional polymorphism and on point mutations was observed. In addition to three differ ent types of deletions in the LBP repeat region, point mutations at altogether 15 positions were found (Table 1). Based on the sequence of their hup B genes the 24 M. ulcerans strains analyzed could be subdivided into eight groups (Table 1). While all nine African isol ates (from six countries) analyzed had the same allele, three different alleles were found among the six Australian strains included. Allele 2 differed in one and allele 3 in three non-synonymous point mutations from the hup B gene sequence (allele 1) of the African isolates. Compared to allele 1, allele 4 had a 27 base deletion in the repeat region of hup B. Of the two isolates from PNG, one had allele 1 and one allele 4. Allele 5 found in th e two Mexican isolates analyzed differed from allele 1 in seven non-synonymous point mutatio ns plus a 27 base deletion located at another position than that of allele 4. While the s ame deletion was also found in the isolates from China and Japan, the three isolates f rom Malaysia, French Guiana and Suriname shared another (54 bp) deletion. While all ele 6 from Japan and China differed in six point mutations form allele 5 (Mexico), there w as a difference in only one position between allele 7 (Malaysia) and allele 8 (French Gu iana and Suriname). While all Asian and American isolates had a T 509 and a C 593 , all African, Australian and PNG isolates had a C509 and a G 593 . CHAPTER 2. Mycobacterium ulcerans Laminin-Binding Protein 35 All three types of deletions were located in a regi on of LBP containing AKKA and ATKAP repeats (Fig. 4). Compared to allele 1, allel e 4 was shortened by a nine amino acid (ATKAP-AKKA) block. In alleles 5 and 6 a variant bl ock (ATKA R-AKKA) present in alleles 1 to 4 was missing. Alleles 7 and 8 shared an 18 amino acid deletion (AKKA- ATKA R-AKKA-ATKAP). Twelve of the 15 single nucleotide po lymorphisms found were non-synonymous. While all but one (C/G 593 ) of these non-synonymous polymorphisms were located within the repeat encoding sequence st retches, two of the three synonymous polymorphisms (C/T 102 and C/T 117 ) were located outside the repeats. An alignment of deduced amino acid sequences of LBP from other myco bacterial species revealed that the N- terminal portion of the protein is highly conser ved between species. Like the intra- species diversity in M. ulcerans, the inter-species diversity is based both on deletional/insertional and on point mutational chan ges and is focused in the C-terminal portion of the protein (Fig. 4). CHAPTER 2. Mycobacterium ulcerans Laminin-Binding Protein 36 Discussion M. ulcerans is an emerging pathogen that seems to have evolved from M. marinum by acquiring a virulence plasmid encoding a polyketide synthase responsible for the synthesis of mycolactone (30, 31). This plasmid has a common evolutionary origin in M. ulcerans isolates from diverse geographical locations around the world (29). The clonal population structure of M. ulcerans is reflected by the fact, that all genetic fingerp rinting method applied so far for M. ulcerans have resolved only a limited number of geographical types (3, 4); (20); (28, 28, 30). To date, the highest re solution, nine distinct profiles related to geographical regions, was obtained by a PCR method that captures differences in regions between the high-copy-number insertion sequences IS 2404 and IS 2606 (28). Only six multi-locus sequence types were found among 18 M. ulcerans isolates of diverse geographical origin when seven unlinked gene loci w ere sequenced (30). In view of this extremely low genetic diversity, it is highly remar kable, that sequencing of the hupB gene of 24 M. ulcerans isolates has identified eight alleles. Interesting ly, three different hupB alleles were found among the six Australian isolate s analyzed here. Two of these alleles (2 and 4) were found in isolates coming from the Victo ria region, and allele 3 was found in a strain from the Queensland area. Of the two analyze d isolates from Papua New Guinea one had an allele 4 found in three isolates from the Vi ctoria region, while the other one had allele 1, which was found in all African isolates, irrespective of the country of origin. Only a single base-exchange distinguished allele 8 found in isolates from Suriname and French Guiana from allele 7 found in a Malaysian isolate. Both alleles share a unique deletion (bp 445-498) which may be indicative for import of the pathogen by Asian contract workers in the last century. The polymorphism of the highly immunogenic LBP may reflect inherent instability of the repetitive sequence stretch or diversifying selecti on pressure. In addition to three different types of deletion in the repeat region, point mutat ions at altogether 15 positions were found. Twelve of these 15 types of point mutation w ere non-synonymous, which indicates that this diversity does not represent accumulation of neutral mutations but is rather the result of some type of selection. The predicted siz e of LBPs is smaller than the observed size in SDS/PAGE, which may be related to the high content of lysine and arginine. The observed variation in protein size and the occurren ce of a second protein band in many of CHAPTER 2. Mycobacterium ulcerans Laminin-Binding Protein 37 the mycobacterial lysates suggest posttranslational modification, such as methylation of the lysine-rich repeats (17). Consistent with our finding of an association of M. ulcerans LBP with the cell wall fraction, homologues of this protein in other mycob acterial species are localized on the mycobacterial surface (26), (15), (18). LBPs seem t o play an important role in the adherence of pathogenic mycobacteria to their targe t tissues within the infected host. LBP of M. leprae binds to the peripheral nerve laminin-2 isoform an d may be involved in the invasion of Schwann cells (26), (22). LBP of M. smegmatis has been shown to promote mycobacterial adherence to pneumocytes and macropha ges (18). It remains to be elucidated, whether LBP of the extracellular pathog en M. ulcerans plays a role in host- pathogen interaction, persistence in insect salivar y glands and/or establishment of biofilms on plant surfaces (14). In M. smegmatis LBP is upregulated by cold-shock stress (27) and in the anaerobiosis-induced dormant state (9). In v iew of these findings it is interesting that the M. ulcerans LBP was detectable in lysates of Buruli ulcer lesio ns. Currently it is not clear whether M. ulcerans can enter into a dormant state and persist in this stage in the mammalian host. LBPs represent immunodominant antig ens (21), (10) and their potential as vaccine components or target structures for immu nodiagnostic tests should be evaluated further.

Mycobacterium ulcerans 18kDa shsp 47 Abstract While it is well established that proximity to wetl ands is a risk factor for contracting Buruli ulcer, it is not clear, which proportion of a popul ation living in an endemic area is exposed to M. ulcerans . Immunological cross-reactivity among mycobacteria l species complicates development of a specific serological test. Among i mmunodominant proteins recognized by a panel of anti- M. ulcerans monoclonal antibodies, the M. ulcerans homologue of the M. leprae 18 kDa small heat shock protein (shsp) was identif ied. Since this shsp has no homologues in M. bovis and M. tuberculosis , we evaluated its use as target antigen for a serological test. Anti-18 kDa shsp antibodies were frequently found in the serum of Buruli ulcer patients and healthy household contacts, but rarely in controls from non-endemic regions. Results indicate that only a small proport ion of M. ulcerans infected individuals develop the clinical disease. CHAPTER 3. Mycobacterium ulcerans 18kDa shsp 48 Introduction Buruli ulcer is a chronic necrotizing disease of sk in and soft tissue caused by M. ulcerans . The disease starts as a subcutaneous nodule, papule or plaque that eventually ulcerates and progresses over months to years. After tuberculosis and leprosy, Buruli ulcer is the third most common mycobacterial infection in immunocompet ent humans. The main burden of disease falls on children living in sub-Saharan Afr ica, but healthy people of all ages, races and socioeconomic class are susceptible as well (2) . In Buruli ulcer lesions, clumps of extra-cellular a cid-fast organisms surrounded by areas of necrosis are often found in subcutaneous fat tissue (19). M ulcerans produces a family of macrolide toxin molecules, the mycolactones, which are associated with tissue destruction and local immunosuppression (13). In cell culture e xperiments, mycolactones produce apoptosis and necrosis in many human cell types (8, 14). The toxin appears to play a role in inhibiting the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the site of infection, which explains at least in part why inflammatory responses are poor i n Buruli ulcer lesions (19). Down- regulation of Th-1 responses may play a role in the progression of early Buruli ulcer disease (15-17,34), but may reverse in later stages (11). Intralesional influx of leukocytes and granulomatous responses in the dermis and panni culus has been reported in late stages of the disease (11,18). Spontaneous healing can occur and is often accompanied by a conversion of the Burulin (M. ulcerans sonicate) skin test from negative to positive. In spite of some degree of local and peripheral T c ell anergy, Buruli ulcer patients seem to be able to raise a humoral immune response against M. ulcerans antigens (15), and the analysis of serological responses to culture filtra te antigens of M. ulcerans has suggested that serological tests may be useful in the diagnos is and surveillance of the disease (9,31). Broad antigenic cross-reactivity between mycobacter ial species represents a major problem for the development of a serological test that is s pecific and sensitive enough to monitor immune responses against M. ulcerans in populations where exposure to M. tuberculosis and BCG vaccination is common. We reasoned that the identification, recombinant ex pression and immunological profiling of immunodominant proteins will provide target stru ctures for analyzing protective CHAPTER 3. Mycobacterium ulcerans 18kDa shsp 49 immune mechanisms and for the development of a sero logical test suitable for detecting M. ulcerans exposure and/or disease. Here, we describe serolog ical responses against a highly immunogenic 18 kDa shsp of M. ulcerans , which has homologue in M. bovis and M. tuberculosis . Serological analysis indicates that this protein represents a suitable target antigen for monitoring exposure to M. ulcerans. CHAPTER 3. Mycobacterium ulcerans 18kDa shsp 50 Materials and Methods Mycobacterial isolates Mycobacterial species included in the study M. (clinical isolate), M. tuberculosis (Pasteur 14001.0001) and M. leprae (offered kindly by Dr. Brennan). M. ulcerans isolates of diverse geographical origin analyzed in this stu dy are: Democratic Republic of Congo (5151), Angola (960657), mycobacteria were cultured as described (37). Mycobacterial lysates and sub cellular fractions Mycobacterial cells were heat-inactivated at 80\u00b0C f or 1 hour and suspended in PBS (50 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.4 ) containing 5% SDS and 1 mM phenylmethyl-sulphonyl fluoride (PMFS), and 10 \u00b5g/m l each of leupeptine and soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo). Two hundr ed mg of cell suspension was subjected to a bead beater (Mikro-Dismembrator, Braun Biotech International) treatment with 400 \u00b5l of 0.1 mm zirconia beads (Bio Spec Products) at 2300 rpm for 15 minutes. Beads and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 10 000 x g for 10 min. Protein content of the lysate was quantified using the BCA protein ass ay (Pierce). For the preparation of sub-cellular fractions, 400 mg of heat inactivated M. ulcerans cells were suspended in 3 ml of PBS containing 0.1% Tween 80 and the proteinase inhibitor cocktail described above. Cells were broken by thre e cycles of ultrasonic disruption (Branson sonifier 250) on ice for 10 min with 50% D uty cycle and 40% output using a microtip probe. Unbroken cells were removed by cent rifugation at 3000 x g for 10 min. A cell-wall fraction was prepared from the supernatan t by centrifugation at 27000 x g for 1 CHAPTER 3. Mycobacterium ulcerans 18kDa shsp 51 hour and was washed twice with PBS. The supernatant was subjected to a 100000 x g centrifugation for 4 h; a cytosol fraction was obta ined from the supernatant and the membrane fraction from the pellet. The membrane fra ction was washed with PBS and dialyzed against 0.01 M ammonium bicarbonate (3). Western blots analysis Mycobacterial lysates and sub-cellular fractions (1 0 \u00b5g of total protein/lane) were separated on 12% SDS PAGE gels under reducing condi tions in Laemmli buffer. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (BioRa d) in tris glycine buffer (25 mM Tris and 192 mM glycine pH 8.3). Filters were blocked wi th 5% skim-milk in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 overnight. Mouse sera or monoclonal antibo dies diluted in blocking solution were incubated with membranes for two hours. Bound antibodies were detected using alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (BCIP)-nitro blue tetrazolium (BioRad) as substrate. For the analysis of human sera, 1 \u00b5g of recombinant 18 kDa shsp of M. ulcerans was on 12% SDS PAGE preparative gels and tran sferred as described above. Human sera diluted 1:100 were incubated with the antigen strips for 1 h. These were washed five times with either non-stringent (0.15 M PBS pH 7.2, 0.1% Tween 20) or stringent wash buffer (0.3 M PBS pH 7.2, 1% Tween 20). After incub ation for 1 h (BCIP)-nitro used as substrate. Generation of monoclonal antibodies Hybridoma cell lines were generated as described (3 2) from mice immunized intra- peritoneally three times with 20 \u00b5g of a lysate of the M. ulcerans strain 97-610 from Ghana formulated in the MPL +TDM adjuvant (Sigma Ch emicals). Three days before cell fusion, mice received an intravenous booster inject ion with 20 \u00b5g of M. ulcerans lysate in PBS. Antibodies specific for M. ulcerans antigens were identified by ELISA using Immunolon 4 plates (Dynes Technologies Inc., Chanti lly, Va.) coated with M. ulcerans lysate. From the panel of hybridomas generated, Wes tern blotting analysis identified three CHAPTER 3. ulcerans mAbs specific for an 18 kDa protein.

After centrifugation at 20000 x g for 30 min the supernatant was applied on to a RP-8 HPLC column (Nucleosil C8). The column was washed 0.1% trifluor oacetic acid in water and then eluted with a gradient of acetonitril. After separation on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, a band with an apparent molecular weight of 18 kDa was excised and digested with trypsin as described (12). For nanoelectrospray ionization tandem mass s pectrometry, the peptides obtained were desalted and concentrated on POROS R2 reverse phase material (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). They were eluted with 60% acetonitrile in 5% formic acid directly into a nanoelectrospray capillary needle. Mass spectra were acquired on a QSTAR i quadrupole TOF tandem mass spectrometer with a nano electrospray ion source (Proxeon, Odense, Denmark) as described (42). Fragmentation by tandem MS yielded a stretch of amino acid sequence together with its location in the peptide (sequence tag). With this sequence tag information, appropriate protein databases were sea rched using MASCOT Search software (Matrix Science, London, UK). These searches were n ot successful because the corresponding protein from M. ulcerans was not in the database. Therefore, the amino acid sequences of the peptides were determined ( de novo tandem MS sequencing) to perform database searches based on sequence homology using FastA software (Genetics computer group, Madison, WI). Sequence analysis of the M. ulcerans 18 kDa shsp encoding gene For sequence analysis, the 18 kDa shsp encoding gen e was amplified by PCR using the primers 5'-CCATGGTGATGCGTACCGACCCG-3' and 5'- CTCGAGGGCTTCTATCACCTCAGG-3'. DNA was extracted as d escribed ((37)) and amplifications were performed with the following pr ofile: 5 min 96\u00b0C; 30 x (1 min 96\u00b0C, 1 min 63\u00b0C, 1 min 72\u00b0C), 7 min 72\u00b0C. Amplicons were p urified using a PCR product purification kit (Qiagen), and then sequenced using an ABI PRISM 310 (Perkin-Elmer). All were reconfirmed at l east twice using independent PCR products. Recombinant expression of the M. ulcerans 18 kDa shsp The M. ulcerans 18 recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli as his- tagged fusion protein (M 1V2M3---A149 LEH 6), comprising the entire open-reading frame of 149 codons with one amino acid exchange (L 2 to V 2). Briefly, the 453-bp PCR product generated from genomic DNA of the Ghanaian M. ulcerans isolate ITM 97-483, using the primers described above, was digested with the rest riction enzymes Nco I and Xho I and cloned into the pETBLUE2 vector employing its Nco I and Xho I/uniF020 sites. Competent E. coli Tuner cells (pLac) (Novagen) were transformed and e xpression of the fusion protein was induced by addition of 1 mM isopropyl thiogalactosi de (IPTG) (Calbiochem) for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. Cells were lysed on ice for 30 min with 8 M u rea, 0.1 M NaH 2PO 4, 0.01 M Tris/HCl (pH 8.0). After centrifugation at 10000 x g, the pr otein was purified from the supernatant by nitrilotriacetic acid column chromatogr M. r18 kDa shsp Antiserum was obtained from mice immunized three ti mes with 20 \u00b5g of M. ulcerans r18 kDa shsp formulated in the MPL +TDM adjuvant (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, Mo). Human sera and tissue lysates Tissue specimens were taken from the IS2404 PCR pos itive center and the PCR negative an excised Buruli ulcer lesion described by Rondini et al. ((37)). Samples of about 100 mg were heat inactivated at 80\u00b0C for 1 h, suspended in reducing Laemmli buffer (39) and subjected to bead beater treatment as desc ribe above. Sera from BU patients and household contacts residing in the Buruli ulcer end emic Ga district of Ghana were collected after informed consent was obtained. Ethi cal approval for the study was obtained from the local ethical review board of the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, Legon, Ghana. CHAPTER 3. Mycobacterium ulcerans 18kDa shsp 54 Results Inter-species cross-reactivity patterns of mAbs rai sed against a whole cell lysate of M. ulcerans To identify immunodominant antigens of M. ulcerans, mice were immunized with a complete lysate of the Ghanaian M. ulcerans strain 97-610. In Western blot analysis, the generated antisera exhibited cross-reactivity with a broad range of M. bovis and M. tuberculosis antigens (data not shown). In order to identify M. ulcerans antigens not present in these two mycobacterial pathogens, B cel l hybridomas were generated with spleen cells of the immunized mice. While some of t he obtained mAbs showed cross- reactivity with all 21 mycobacterial species tested , others were more selective (Fig.1). The highest selectivity was observed with three mAbs, d esignated DD2.5, 2.6 and 3.6, which stained a M. ulcerans protein with an apparent molecular mass of 18 kDa. Although generated from two different mice, all three mAbs s hared the same limited inter-species cross-reactivity pattern, i.e. they only reacted wi th M. chelonae, where a protein with an apparent mass of 20 kDa was recognized. In indirect immunofluorescence assays only M. ulcerans was stained by mAbs DD2.5, DD2.6 and DD3.6 (data no t shown), indicating that cross-reactivity with M. chelonae was too low in affinity to be detectable in this a ssay. The mAbs stained an 18 kDa band in all ten M. ulcerans isolates of different geographical origins tested (data not shown). Identification of the mAb DD2.5/2.6/3.6 reactive pr otein For the identification of the ctive kDa was by reverse-phase HPLC. Fractions in which the immune reactive protein was enriched were identified by We stern blot analysis, peak fractions were pooled, and the 18 kDa band cut-out from a SDS-PAGE gel loaded with the pooled material. The excised protein was analyzed by matri x-assisted laser desorption ionization- mass spectrometry (Fig. 2). The three peptide seque nces obtained matched to sequence stretches (Table 1) of a M. leprae protein (Swissprot:18kd_mycle) designed 18 kDa shs p (HSP 16.5) (5). A M. ulcerans homologue with 79 % protein identity (Fig. 3) and 8 5 % identity at the DNA sequence level was identified b y homology search in the M. ulcerans genome project database (http: genopole.pasteur.fr/ Mulc/BuruList.html). Codon analysis of the M. ulcerans gene predicted a functional open-reading frame of 1 49 amino acids and CHAPTER 3. Mycobacterium ulcerans 18kDa shsp 55 a molecular mass of 16,556 Da. A gene bank Blast se arch identified homologues of 18 kDa shsp in M. intracellulare , M. avium , with protein sequence identity of 79.5%, 71.5% and 78.8%, respectively, and extensive inter-species diversity focused on the carboxyl-terminus (Fig.3). In contrast, no homo logues are present in the M. tuberculosis and M. bovis genomes. To confirm the identification of the 18 kDa shsp as target for mAbs DD2.5, DD2.6 and DD3.6, the complete coding sequence of the M. ulcerans homologue was expressed as carboxy-terminally hexa-histidine tagged fusion pro tein in E. coli. All three mAbs showed reactivity with the affinity-purified recombinant p rotein in Western blot analysis (data not shown). Inter-species immunological cross-reactivity of the 18 kDa shsp was analyzed further by Western blot analysis with mouse antisera raised ag ainst the recombinant M. ulcerans 18 Like the mAbs DD2.5, DD3. all six antisera tested exhibited cross-reactivity with M. chelonae (Fig. 4). In addition, antisera cross-reacted with an 18 kDa M. leprae protein, which was only stained by mAbs DD2.5, DD2 .6 and DD3.6 when they were used at very high ( 5 \u00b5g/ml) concentrations (data not shown). When a s et of ten overlapping synthetic 20mer peptides spanning the e ntire sequence of the M. ulcerans 18 kDa shsp was tested in ELISA, mAbs DD2.5, DD2.6 and DD3.6 showed no reactivity and only some of the antisera bound weakly to the C-ter minal peptide. Sequence conservation, sub-cellular localization an d expression the M. ulcerans 18 kDa shsp in Buruli ulcer lesions Only four were dete cted when the 18 kDa shsp encoding genes of ten M. ulcerans isolates of diverse geographical origin were compar ed by PCR amplification and DNA sequence analysis of PCR prod ucts (Fig. 3) . Two single nucleotide polymorphisms, one non-synonymous (G/T 424 ) and one synonymous (T/C 374 ) distinguished the sequence of strain 7922 from French Guiana from that of the Ghanaian genome proj ect reference strain Agy-99. Strain 8756 exh ibited two synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (G/A 278 and C/T 395 ) with respect to the reference sequence. CHAPTER 3. Mycobacterium ulcerans 18kDa shsp 56 Sequences from the other eight M. ulcerans strains analyzed were identical with the Agy- 99 reference sequence. The mAb DD2.5/6/3.6-reactive band was primarily fou nd in M. fractions (Fig. 5A), but was undetectable in cytoso l fractions (Fig. 5A) and in culture filtrate (not shown). The M. ulcerans 18 kDa shsp was detectable in human tissue lysates from the centre of excised Buruli ulcer lesions (Fi g. 5B). No staining was observed in lysates from the healthy margins of the excised tis sue (Fig. 5B) . Reactivity of human sera with the recombinant 18 kD a shsp of M. ulcerans In Western blot analyses, the majority of sera from pre-ulcerative (Fig. showed reactivity the 18 kDa protein of M. ulcerans . While 75% (24/32) of the patient sera were tested positive, 38% (9/24) of sera from house hold contacts also showed reactivity (Fig. 6D). Samples from Europeans (Fig 6F) and from the vast majority of Africans living in Buruli ulcer non-endemic regions (Fig. 6E) were negative. CHAPTER 3. Mycobacterium ulcerans 18kDa shsp 57 Discussion Currently it is not clear, which proportion of a po pulation living in an African Buruli ulcer focus area is exposed to M. ulcerans . In the case of M. tuberculosis , an infection remains latent in 90-95% of individuals and progressive dis ease development is only observed in a minority of infected individuals. Likewise a signif icant proportion of individuals infected by M. ulcerans may not develop the disease. Few data are availabl e on co-infections of HIV and M. ulcerans and it is not entirely clear whether HIV infection is a risk factor for Buruli ulcer (1). Anecdotal evidence indicates that HIV infection affects the outcome of Buruli ulcer disease (21). For the assessment of the prevalence of exposure, a test is required that is negative for non- exposed persons from non-endemic regions and positi ve for a significant proportion of exposed individuals in an endemic region. The test should discriminate between immune responses against M. ulcerans and other mycobacteria, in particular M. tuberculosis and M. bovis BCG . Serological studies performed with complex antigen preparations have suggested that serological tests may be useful in t he diagnosis and surveillance of Buruli ulcer (9,16,31). In view of the presence of species cross-reactive antibodies in sera of Africans living in Buruli ulcer endemic regions, th oroughly selected recombinantly expressed target antigens are required. Our search for immunodominant proteins of M. ulcerans has identified the 18 kDa shsp as promising candida te for a serological test suitable to monitor the exposure of a population to M. ulcerans. While the 18 kDa shsp has no homologue in the genomes of M. bovis and M. tuberculosis, homologues have been described in M. leprae , M. intracellulare , and M. avium against the recombinantly expressed M. ulcerans protein showed cross-reactivity with a 18 kDa protein of M. leprae and a 20 kDa protein of M. chelonae , but not with M. , and lysates. The 18 kDa shsp of M. leprae has been evaluated as target antigen for serological and cellular diagnostic tests for l eprosy (10,29,43). While the M. leprae protein seems to share epitopes with an unidentifie d M. tuberculosis antigen (30,36,41), our mAbs and mouse sera specific for the M. ulcerans 18 kDa shsp did not cross-react with M. tuberculosis and M. bovis BCG lysates. from individuals li ulcer non-endemic regions were largely ne gative. These results indicate, that immune responses against environmental mycobacteria , such M. chelonae, which is widely CHAPTER 3. Mycobacterium ulcerans 18kDa shsp 58 distributed in the environment (4,22) expresses a cross-reactive homologue of the 18 kDa shsp, do not obscure results with the M. ulcerans 18 kDa shsp based serological test. Like its homologue in M. leprae (23), the 18 kDa shsp of M. ulcerans is associated with the cell-wall fraction. It has been postulated, tha t the 18 kDa shsp of M. leprae is relevant for the survival of the mycobacteria within macroph ages (7). While M. ulcerans is largely an extracellular pathogen, it appears to be capture d by phagocytes and transported to draining lymph nodes within host cells during the e arly stage of infection (6). The M. ulcerans 18 kDa shsp may play a role in this early intracell ular stage of the infection and protect the mycobacteria in extreme environmental c onditions by stabilizing the cell wall (25,26). While it is clear from many epidemiological studies , that proximity to wetlands is a risk factor for M. ulcerans infection, the exact mode of transmission is not c lear (20). Recent field and laboratory studies have implicated aquati c insects in the transmission of the pathogen (25,33) and is has been demonstrated that mycolactone toxin-producing M. ulcerans isolates are able to invade the salivary glands of water insects (24). M. ulcerans DNA has also been detected by PCR in aquatic snails , fish, and the biofilm of aquatic plants (27,38,40), but the contributions of these e lements of the environment in transmission has remained largely unknown. M. ulcerans may often reach the human dermis through minor wounds or skin abrasions via c ontact with M. ulcerans containing environmental reservoirs (28). Our analysis of sera from healthy household contacts indicates that exposure to M. ulcerans leads only in a minority of exposed individuals to clinical disease. Most of the others may only devel op transient infection foci and even nodular lesions may resolve spontaneously (35). Imm une responses in healthy household contacts have also been described in an Australian study (16), where a lower background staining than with African sera facilitated analysi s with cellular extracts. Our preliminary analysis of sera from Africans living in Buruli ulc er endemic regions indicate that exposure is common in these environments also among non-hous ehold contacts. Future prospective analysis of cellular and humoral immune responses w ith recombinant M. ulcerans proteins in a population living in a highly endemic region o f Africa should give better insight into CHAPTER 3. Mycobacterium ulcerans 18kDa shsp 59 patterns of exposure. Such studies may also lead to the identification of surrogate markers of protection crucial for the development of a vacc ine against M. ulcerans infection.

Abstract Buruli ulcer characterized by chronic, necrotizing ulceration of subcutaneous tissues and the overlyin g skin. M. ulcerans produces a family of macrolide toxin molecules, the mycolactones, which are associated with tissue destruction and local down-regulation of Th-1 responses. Since M. ulcerans ulcer lesions, antibody-mediated immune e ffector functions may be of great importance for immune protection. By generating pan els of monoclonal antibodies from M. ulcerans antigen immunized mice we identified a range of immunodominant mycobacterial antigens. Some of these may have pote ntial as vaccine candidate antigens or as target structures for serological or cellular di agnostic test systems. CHAPTER 4. M. ulcerans ' Immunodominant antigens 73 Introduction Buruli ulcer caused by the slow growing environment al pathogen M. ulcerans is characterized by the development of chronic, necrot izing skin and soft tissue ulcers 1. The disease starts as a subcutaneous nodule or plaque t hat eventually ulcerates and progresses over weeks to months until surgical excision or spo ntaneous healing occurs. In endemic regions, BU is the most common mycobacterial diseas e after tuberculosis and leprosy among immunocompetent people. It has been observed in over 30 tropical and subtropical countries, but the main burden of disease falls on children living in sub-Saharan Africa 2. Although it is well established that proximity to m arshes and wetlands is a risk factor for contracting BU, the natural reservoir and the exact mode of transmission is unclear 1. In BU lesion, clumps of extra-cellular acid-fast or ganisms surrounded by areas of necrosis are found primarily in subcutaneous fat tissue 3. A diffusible toxic macrolide, mycolactone, plays a key role in the pathogenesis 4. Since the toxin causes mammalian cells to undergo apoptosis, its action explains at least in part tha t inflammatory responses in BU lesions are poor 3. Th-1 cell driven production of gamma interferon a ppear to be down-regulated in Buruli ulcer patients in the early stage of the dis ease 5-7. This down-regulation may reverse in later stages 8. M. ulcerans infection leads to the generation of antibodies aga inst a variety of mycobacterial antigens 5-7,9,10 . analysis of anti- M. ulcerans immune responses. All humans are exposed to environ mental mycobacteria which frequently come into the contact with the skin and mucous membranes. In addition, in areas where M. ulcerans is endemic, the majority of children are vaccinated with BCG and exposed to M. tuberculosis . In the last 20 years, the isolation and characterization of antigens from complex mixtu res such as parasites and bacteria, including M. leprae and M. tuberculosis , have been vastly facilitated by monoclonal antibodies technology 11-14 . In the present report we describe a panel of mono clonal antibodies generated from mice immunized with M. ulcerans cell lysates. While our primary interest was to identify antigens suitable as target structures for M. ulcerans specific immunodiagnostic assays, some of the immun odominat antigens identified may also have potential as vaccine components or as tar get structures for genetic fingerprinting methods required for micro-epidemiological studies . CHAPTER 4. M. ulcerans ' Immunodominant antigens 74 Materials and Methods Mycobacterial lysates and sub cellular fractions M. ulcerans isolates of diverse geographical origin used in thi s study are: Suriname (ITM 842), Democratic Republic (001441). All strains except for 001441 (isolated f rom an infected insect) were clinical isolates. Other mycobacterial species included in t he analyses are M. 19977), M. smegmatis terrae (clinical isolate), and M. tuberculosis (Pasteur 14001.0001). For the preparation of lysates, mycobacterial cells were heat-inactivated at 80\u00b0C for 1 hour and suspended in PBS (50mM sodium phosphate, 150mM sodium chloride, pH trypsin inhibitor (Sigma, St . Louis, Mo). Two hundred mg of cell suspension was subjected to a bead beater (Mikro-Di smembrator, Braun Biotech International) treatment with 400\u00b5l of 0.1mm zirconia beads (Bio S pec Products) at 2300 rpm for 15 minutes. Beads and unbroken cells were r emoved by centrifugation at 10000g for 10 min. Protein content of the lysate was quan tified using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). For the preparation of sub-cellular fractions, 400 mg of heat inactivated M. ulcerans cells were suspended in 3 ml of PBS containing 0.1% Tween 80 and the proteinase inhibitor cocktail described above. Cells were broken by thre e cycles of ultrasonic disruption (Branson sonifier 250) on ice for 10 min with 50% D uty cycle and 40% output using a microtip probe. Unbroken cells were removed by cent rifugation at 3000g for 10 min. A cell wall fraction was prepared from the supernatan t by centrifugation at 27000g for 1 hour CHAPTER 4. M. ulcerans ' Immunodominant antigens 75 and was washed twice with PBS. The supernatant was subjected to a 100,000g centrifugation for 4h; a cytosol fraction was obtai ned from the supernatant and the membrane fraction from the pellet. The membrane fra ction was washed with PBS and suspended in 0.01M ammonium bicarbonate and the sup ernatant was dialyzed against ammonium bicarbonate 15 . Immunization with M. ulcerans lysate and whole cells Groups of mice carrying immunoglobulin heavy chain 2a and light chain replacement mutations 16 were used for intraperitoneal immunization with M. ulcerans antigens. Group I was immunized with approximately 2 x 10 8 heat-inactivated M. ulcerans 97-610 cells emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Group I I received 20 \u00b5g of a lysate of strain 97-610 in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Group III w as immunized with 20 \u00b5g of the lysate in MPL +TDM adjuvant (Sigma Chemicals, St. L ouis, Mo). Humoral immune responses against M. ulcerans antigens were evaluated by ELISA and Western blot analyses. Generation of monoclonal antibodies Hybridoma cell lines were generated as described 17 . Three days before cell fusion, mice received an intravenous booster injection with M. ulcerans lysate or capsular material in PBS. Hybridomas secreting antibodies specific for M. ulcerans lysate antigens were identified by ELISA using Immunolon 4 plates (Dynes Technologies Inc., Chantilly, Va.) coated with M. ulcerans lysate. Indirect immunofluorescence test Heat inactivated M. ulcerans cells were placed on a poly-L-Lysine-coated glass microscope slide (Erie-Scientific ES-242B-AD) and f ixed by drying over night at room temperature. Slides were incubated for 30 min at ro om temperature with sera or mAbs diluted in 1% skim milk in water and washed five ti mes with distilled water. Bound antibodies were detected using FITC- or Cy3-conjuga ted goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, Mo) as secondary antibodies. The DNA of M. ulcerans was label with Hoechst dye no. 33256 (bisBenzimidine, Sigma C hemicals, St. Louis, Mo). After washing with water slides were sealed with mounting medium [o-phenydiamine CHAPTER 4. M. ulcerans ' Immunodominant antigens 76 dihydrochloride (Sigma, Chemicals. St. Louis, Mo), 0.1M tris and Glycerol (Sigma, Chemicals, St. Louis, Mo)]. Western blot analysis Mycobacterial lysates and sub-cellular fractions (1 0\u00b5g of total protein/lane) were separated on 12% SDS PAGE gels under reducing conditions in L aemmli buffer 18 . Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose paper (BioRad) in Tri s glycine buffer (25 mM Tris and 192 mM glycine pH 8.3). Filters were blocked overnight with PBS containing 5% skim milk and 0.1% Tween 20. Mouse sera or monoclonal antibod ies diluted in blocking solution were incubated with membranes for two hours. Bound antibodies were detected using alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, Mo) as secondary antibodies and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP)-nitro blue tetrazolium (BioRad) as substrate. CHAPTER 4. M. ulcerans ' Immunodominant antigens 77 Results Dissection of the complex anti- M. ulcerans antibody responses of mice by generation of mAbs Complex antibody responses were observed in Western blotting analysis of sera from mice immunized with whole heat inactivated M. ulcerans cells or with lysates. Sera of mice immunized with whole heat inactivated mycobacterial (Fig. 1A) showed reactivity against a broad-range of antigens. The most promine nt bands had an apparent molecular mass of about 250kDa and 71kDa and were also found in lysates of the three other mycobacterial species ( M. tuberculosis , M. marinum and M. bovis ) tested. Antibodies elicited by M. ulcerans lysate in combination with Freund's (Fig. 1B) or M PL-KLP adjuvant (Fig. 1C) showed predominantly inter-speci es cross-reactivity with M. marinum. Reactivity with protein bands of apparent molecular masses between 36 and 32kDa dominated. Antigens recognized by antisera elicited with M .ulcerans lysate and MPL- KLP included a 35kDa band present in all four mycob acterial species tested and an 18kDa band only found with M. ulcerans (Fig. 1C). Immunofluorescence analysis also demonstrated broad cross-reactivity of all sera wit h all four mycobacterial species tested (data not shown). Monoclonal antibodies were generated from mice immu nized with a lysate of M. ulcerans strain 97-610 in incomplete Freund's adjuvant and w ith the lysate in MPL +TDM adjuvant. Eighteen mAbs were selected for further a nalysis; their isotypes and binding pattern to a range of M. ulcerans proteins are summarized in table 1. Fifteen of the eighteen mAbs reacted against M. ulcerans antigens in Western blot analysis (Fig. 2). MAbs VC1.3 and DD2.4 were negative in Western blots , but strongly positive in immunofluorescence analysis. Fourteen of the 18 mAb s showed reactivity against M. ulcerans by immunofluorescence analyses. The mAbs DD2.7/3.1 /2/4 were IFA negative, however, they bond to denature proteins by Western blot analyses. Different staining patterns were observed, including cellular and diff use extra-cellular staining patterns (Fig 3). Association of the mAb-reactive antigens with subce llular fractions of M. ulcerans was analyzed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4). The 50k Da protein recognized by mAbs DD2.1/VC1.1/2, the binding protei 4. M. ulcerans ' Immunodominant antigens 78 the 18kDa small heat shock protein (shsp) recognize d by mAbs DD2.5/6/3.5/6 were primarily present in the cell wall fraction. Identification of the latter tw o proteins will be described elsewhere. Two other immunodominant antig ens, the 71 kDa protein recognized recogn ized DD3.3/4 were detected in more than one subcellular fraction. Sta ining of the 34-37 kDa protein was observed in extracts obtained with 1% SDS or 1% Sar cosyl, but not with other detergents or with 8M urea (data not shown). None of the immun odominant antigens were detectable in culture filtrate cross- reactivity of anti- M. ulcerans mAbs and size variation in M. ulcerans isolates of diverse geographical origin Cross-reactivity of mAbs was analysed by Western bl otting with from mycobacterial Orthologues of 71 kDa pr otein (Fig 5D), and the laminin- binding protein (data not shown) were detectable in all 20 mycobacterium species tested. In contrast, mAb DD3.3/4 stained 34-37 kDa bands (Fig. DD2.1 and VC1.1/2 st ained a 50 kDa protein in a broader spectrum of mycobacterial species (Fig. 5A and 5B, respectively). MAbs DD2.5/6/3.5/6 stained an orthologue of the M. ulcerans 18kDa shsp only in M. (data not shown). Immunofluorescence analysis reconfirmed the cross-r that reco gnized only M. ulcerans (data no shown). Western blot analysis with a spectrum of M. ulcerans isolates of geographically diverse origin revealed slight size variation in the staine d 50kDa, 34-37kDa and 27-32kDa protein bands. The 50kDa protein (fig. 8D and 8E) was sligh tly larger in American than in African strains. In the case of the 34-37 kDa double bands, the bands were slightly smaller in isolates from China and Japan (Fig.8A-8C). No size variation was found in the 18kDa shsp and the 71kDa protein (data not shown). Variation i n the number and size of the stained bands may reflect differences in length of the codi ng gene sequences and/or in posttranslational modification. CHAPTER 4. M. ulcerans ' Immunodominant antigens 79 Discussion Analysis of immune responses to M. ulcerans may contribute to a more effective control of Buruli ulcer by identifying antigens suitable as ta rgets for a specific diagnostic test or a vaccine. Studies of immunodominant antigens of M. tuberculosis and M. leprae have provided such candidate target structures including antigens belonging to the family of heat shock proteins 11 carbohydrates-glicolipids [arabinomannan 23 , lipoarabinomannan 24 ]. While various techniques have been used for the identification of protective antigens and targets for diagnostic test s, most structures have been identified and characterized with mAbs 11,25,26 or by characterization of T-cell responses in mous e models27 . Since our knowledge of immune responses against M. ulcerans antigens is very limited, we have started to identify immunodominant antigens by generating a panel of mAbs from M. ulcerans immunized mice. The nature of the humoral immune re sponse of mice to M. ulcerans antigens was strongly dependant on the immunisation procedure, facilitating the generation of mAbs against a broad range of antigen s. We observed a broad inter-species cross-reactivity of most mAbs within the non-tuberc ulous and the tuberculous group. This antigenic overlap complicates the development of a M. ulcerans serodiagnostic test in endemic areas where BCG vaccination has been implem ented and tuberculosis is also endemic. On the other hand, it may facilitate the d evelopment of a vaccine which can protect simultaneously against several mycobacteria l diseases. In this context, it is of interest that BCG offers some protection against Bu ruli ulcer in general and in particular against the most severe forms of the disease 28 . The cell surface associated immunodominant antigens here (50kDa, 71kDa, 18kDa shsp, laminin binding protein) may have potential for sub unit vaccine development. In the case of tuberculosis, surface exposed and secreted antig ens recognized by antibodies and IFN- secreting T-cells have been considered promising ca ndidate antigens. The most extensively studied candidate antigens for a tuberculosis subun it vaccine 22 . Subunit vaccine formulations incorporating recombinant proteins, synthetic peptides or DNA vac cines have conferred partial CHAPTER 4. M. ulcerans ' Immunodominant antigens 80 protection against tuberculosis in experimental ani mals. The most common approach is now to test more than one antigen in a single vacci ne to ensure broad coverage of an immunogenetically heterogeneous population. In the case of the extracellularly multiplying pathogen M. ulcerans, antibodies may play a key role in immunoprotection and a combination of several surface exposed antigens may be suitable for vaccine development. Future passive immune protection experiments with t he mAbs described in this study may help to identify antigens suitable for inclusion in to a subunit vaccine. CHAPTER 4.

D13, A Conserved-Stage-Specific Antigen of P. falciparum 93 Abstract We have identified a novel conserved protein of Plasmodium falciparum , designated D13, that is stage-specifically expressed in asexual blood stages of the parasite. The predicted open reading frame (ORF) D13 contains 863 amino acids with a calculate d molecular mass of 99.7 kDa and displays a repeat region composed o f pentapeptide motives. Northern blot analysis with lysates of synchronized blood stage parasites showed that D13 is highly expressed at the mRNA level during schizogony. The first N'-term inal 138 amino acids of D13 were expressed in Escherichia coli and the purified protein was used to generate anti- D13 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Using total lysates of blood stage parasite s and Western blot analysis, these MAbs stained one single band o f 100 kDa, corresponding to the predicted molecular mass of ORF D13. Western blot analysis demonstrated further that D13 is expressed during schizogony, declines rapidly in early ring stages a nd is undetectable in trophozoites. D13 protein is localized in indivi dual merozoites in a distinct area, as demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescenc e analysis. After subcellular fractionation, D13 was confined to the pelleted fraction of the parasite lysate and its extraction by alkaline carbonate buffer treatment indicated th at D13 is not a membrane- integral protein. Inclusion of certain anti-D13 MAbs into in vitro cultures of blood stage parasites resulted in considerable reduction in parasite growth. The N '-terminal domain encompassing 158 amino acids is 94 and 95%, respect ively, identical at the amino acid level between Plasmodium knowlesi , Plasmodium yoelii , and P. falciparum . In summary, we describe a novel stage-specifically expressed, highly conser ved gene product of P. falciparum that is recognized by parasite growth inhibitory antibodies. CHAPTER 5. D13, A Conserved-Stage-Specific Antigen of P. falciparum 94 Introduction Malaria is a debilitating and frequently fatal dise ase of the tropics caused by parasites of the genus Plasmodium . Four different species cause human malaria, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax accounting for the majority of the problem. The fo rmer causes widespread mortality, and the latter is most prevalent outside Africa. Annually 300 million clinical malaria cases are reported, with over 1 million deaths in sub-Sah aran Africa alone (23). Widespread and increasing drug and inse cticide resistance has exacerbated the situation, undermining the effectiv eness of malaria control methods that depend on chemotherapy and vector control, respectively (21). Novel means to fight th e disease are urgently needed, and a vaccine is predicted to have the greatest impact in addition to being the most cost-effective control measure (11,20). Access to the sequence of the entire genome of P. falciparum has provided the opportunity to deduce the function of many of the predicted proteins through the identificatio n of orthologue genes and motifs in other organism (11). However, a s with annotation of the human genome, the annotation of the complete P. falciparum genome represents a major challenge. Almost two-thirds of the predicted genes of the published chromosomes 2 and 3 had no detectable orthologues in other organisms, suggesti ng that many aspects of parasite biology has still to be discovered (9). P. falciparum has a complex life cycle involving transmission within and between vertebrate and invertebrate hosts by specialized cell-invasive stages, termed zoites. Sporozoites injected into a human host by the bite of an infective mosquito i nvade hepatocytes and, after schizogony, release thousands of merozoi tes capable of invading red blood cells (RBC). All of the clinical symptoms and pathogenic manifestations associated with mammalian malaria infections are caused by the asexual erythrocytic p hase of the Plasmodium life cycle. After invasion of erythrocyt es, merozoites develop into trophozoites, and multiply further within these cells, forming multinucleated blood stage schizonts. These infected RBC rupture, releasing newly formed merozoites into the circulation that can invade new erythrocytes. An intricate seri es of biological events and developmental processes must occur for this cyclica l erythrocytic stage of the infection to continue in a vertebrate host. Thus, the elucidation of molecular mechanisms responsible for recognition and subsequent invasion of erythroc ytes by the malaria parasite is of central importance towards the development of new intervention strategies. CHAPTER 5. D13, A Conserved-Stage-Specific Antigen of P. falciparum 95 In this study properties of a novel protein encoded by an open reading frame (ORF), designated D13, is described. The sequence of D13 is highly conserved in several P. falciparum isolates and orthologues of it are identified in the genome of Plasmodium knowlesi and Plasmodium yoelii . The parasite growth inhibitory activity of anti-D13 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) is indicative for a functionally essential role of this protein in parasite biology. CHAPTER 5. D13, A Conserved-Stage-Specific Antigen of P. falciparum 96 Materials and Methods Identification of ORF D13 A cDNA library was constructed from total RNA isola ted from P. falciparum strain K1 employing the SMART PCR cDNA Library Construction Kit (Clontech) as described (5). Briefly, 2 \u00b5g of total RNA was reverse transcribed using a modifi ed oligo(dT) primer, and the SMART oligonucleotide was added to the reaction to serve as a short, extended template at the 5' end of the RNA for reverse transcription. To select for PCR pr oducts longer than 0.7 kb, PCR products were run on a 1% agarose gel, selectively excised, and purified. PCR products were into pGem 5 T vector (Promega). DH125 cells (BRL- Life Technologies) were transformed by electroporation with the P. falciparum cDNA library. Plasmid DNA of randomly picked clones was digested with enzymes Not I/ Nco I, and the insert size was analyzed on 1% agarose gels . Clones carrying inserts of more than 1 kb were chosen for further analysis. Linearized DNA was transcribed and transl ated in vitro as described (6) and positive cDNA clones were char acterized further by sequencing employing an ABI 310 automatic sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). P. falciparum culture and Northern blot analysis P. falciparum strains K1 and FVO were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing gentamicin (50 mg/li ter) and 10% A + human serum at a hematocrit of 5%, essentially as described previously (14). In some experiments, the cultures were synchronized by hemolysis of mature trophozoit e stage-parasitized erythrocytes in a 5% (wt/vol) sorbitol solution wit h two sorbitol synchronization steps one cycle before harvesting. Synchronization was confirmed and the level of parasitemia estimated by standard microscopy. Aliquots of cells were taken every 6 h postsynchronization. Cells were washed and total RNA prepared using TRIz ol reagent (Gibco-BRL) as described previously (25). Total RNA (25 \u00b5g) was separated on 0.8% agarose gel and transferred to Hybond-XL nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a vacuum blotter (Appligene) as described elsewhere (25). Hy bridization was performed in an UltraHyb device (Ambion) at (complete cDNA; AF03044) (5) generated by random priming using High Prime solution (Roche Biochemicals). High stringency washes were performed at 42\u00b0C. Memb ranes were CHAPTER 5. D13, A Conserved-Stage-Specific Antigen of P. falciparum 97 subjected to autoradiography using X-ray films. Loa ding of equal amounts of RNA on agarose gels was confirmed by comparison of the intensity of ethidium bromide stained bands of 18S and 28S RNA. Recombinant expression of N'-terminal fragment of D 13 The N'-terminal 139 amino acid residues were recomb inant expressed in Escherichia coli using the pETBlue2 expression system (Novagen). Briefly, PCR product of D13 was generated from a cDNA library of P. falciparum strain K1 employing the following primer combination: 5'-CAACACCATGGTTTATGCCACACTTTTGAGTG-3' and 5'- CGTTTGCTCGAGTGGCAACTTGTAAGTACCAGGG-3', containing Nco I and Xho I sites, respectively. The 422-bp amplicon was digested with the restriction enzymes and cloned into the pETBlue2 vector employing its Nco I and Xho I sites. Recombinant plasmids were sequenced to ensure that the D13 fragment was in the correct reading frame and to exclude PCR errors. Competent E. coli Tuner cells (pLys) (Novagen) were transformed with the recombinant plasmid and expression of the fusion pr otein was induced by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl thiogalactoside (IPTG) (Calbiochem) after the A600 reached 0.6. The cells were induced at 37\u00b0C for 4 h and were harvested by centrifugatio n and lysed on ice for 30 min with 8 M urea, 0.1 M NaH 2PO 4, 0.01 M Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) and sonicated. After centrifugation at 10,000 x g, the supernatant was loaded onto an nitrilotriacet ic acid column (Qiagen) and purified according to manufactu rer's instructions. The hexahistidine- tagged recombinant protein was recovered using elution buffer (8 M urea, 0.1 M NaH 2PO 4, 0.01 M Tris-HCl [pH 4.5], 500 mM imidazole). protein sodium dodecyl sulfate-15% polyacrylamide gel electrophore sis (SDS-15% PAGE), and the protein concentration was determined according to the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as the standard.

A group of five mice was immunized subcutaneously three times with 50 \u00b5g recombinant D13 protein isolated under denaturing conditions and formulated in MPL+T DM adjuvant (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, Mo.). Three days befor e cell fusion, the mice received an CHAPTER 5. D13, A Conserved-Stage-Specific Antigen of P. falciparum 98 intravenous booster injection with 20 \u00b5g of recombinant D13 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were fused with PAI mouse myeloma cells as a fusion partner (19). Hybrids were selected in hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine (HAT) medium, and cells secreting D13-specific immunoglobulin (IgG) by (ELISA) using Immunolon 4 plates (Dynex Technologies Inc., Chantilly, Va.) coated with D13 protein. Four hybridoma cell lines (named DD1.1, DD1.2, DD1.3, and DD1.4) specific for the D13 N'-terminal fragment could be established and characterized. Western blot analysis and fractionation of infected erythrocytes SDS-PAGE was performed essentially as described (5) . Briefly, total cell lysates of asynchronous or synchronous cultures of P. falciparum (strain FVO) were run on 10% gels. For time course analyses, aliquots of synchronous cultures of malar ia-infected erythrocytes were harvested at 6-h intervals and wa shed with PBS, pH 8.0. The cells were lysed in 10 ml of 0.15% saponin in H 2O, and hemoglobin-depleted infected erythrocytes were collected by centrifugation. Aliquots of the samples were mix ed with loading buffer and heated 5 min at 95\u00b0C before loading on the gels . As a molecular weight marker, SeeBluePlus (Invitrogen) was used. Separated proteins were transferred electrophoretic ally filter (Protean Nitrocellulose, BA then incubated with hybridoma supernata nt for 1 h. After several washing steps, were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugat Ig (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif.) for 1 h. Blots were developed using the ECL system according to manufacturer's instructions. For subcellular fractionation experiments, late sta ge infected erythrocytes were enriched to 95 to 99% using 60% Percoll gradient essentially as described previously (29). Cells wer e washed three times in Hanks buffered salt solution and lys ed by three cycles of freeze-thaw in 10 volumes of double-distilled water A total membrane fraction was collected by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 x g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. For certain experiments, equivalent amounts of the sediments were treated with 100 mM Na 2CO 3, pH 11.3, or with distilled H 2O containing protease inhibitors for 30 min on ice prior to further centrifugation for 1 h at 1 00,000 x g (6). Samples were solubilized in denaturing SDS sample b uffer and equivalent amounts of each CHAPTER 5. D13, A Conserved-Stage-Specific Antigen of P. falciparum 99 sample were subjected to Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was conducted with anti-D13 MAb DD1.1 and the N'-terminal block 1 MSP-1 (Helg et al., submitted for publication). The blots were developed using the ECL system. Immunofluorescence analysis of asexual blood stage parasites Immunofluorescence analysis of blood stage parasite s was conducted essentially as described (5). Briefly, multitest immunofluorescenc e microscopy slides (Flow Labs, Switzerland) were pretreated with 0.01% (wt/vol) poly-L-lysine (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature and washed. Erythrocytes from in vitro cultivated P. falciparum (strain FVO) were washed and mixed with 2 volumes of a solu tion containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Triton X-100. Droplets of 30 \u00b5l of cell suspension were added to each well and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Cells wer e blocked with blocking solution containing 100-mg/ml fatty acid-f ree bovine serum albumin in PBS. Cells were incubated with hybridoma supernatants for 1 h. After several washing steps, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies specific for mo use IgG conjugated with Cy3. The immunoreactivity was observed using a Leic a TCS NT confocal microscope. Images were acquired with a 63x Plan-Apochromat oil immersion objective (NA 1.32). Pinhole settings were 1 airy unit for all images that were processed with Imaris (Bitplane, Switzerland) and Adobe Photoshop (Mountain View, Ca lif.). Sequence analysis of D13 derived from parasite stra ins. Genomic DNA was prepared from P. falciparum strains K1, IFA9, and MAD20 and used for PCR amplification of D13 in order to gain insight into possible nucleotide sequence poly morphism. For sequence analysis, D13 was amplified in two overlapping fragments with the following primer combinations: forward (p17), performed with the following profile: 5 min 94\u00b0C; (25 x 20 s 94\u00b0C, 30 s 44\u00b0C, 2 min 68\u00b0C) 7 min 72\u00b0C, soak at 4\u00b0C. Amplicons were purified using a PCR product purification kit (Roche CHAPTER 5. D13, A Conserved-Stage-Specific Antigen of P. falciparum 100 Molecular Biochemicals) according to manufacturer's protocol and cloned int o the pGEM5 T-vector (Promega, Catalys AG). After isolation kit (Macherey-Nagel AG), double-stranded plasmid DNA was sequenced and analyzed employing an ABI PRISM 310 genetic analyzer (Perkin-Elmer). All strains we re amplified twice and several independent plasmids were sequenc ed on both strands using internal primers designed according to the D13 sequence available from the genome project. In vitro parasite growth inhibition assays In vitro growth inhibition assays with P. falciparum strain K1 were conducted essentially as described (16). Briefly, synchronous late trophozoites were diluted with fresh RBC to give a parasitemia of 0.5% and were mixed with purified MAbs at the in dicated concentrations. Parasites were cultivated under an atmosphere of 4% CO 2, 3% O2, and 93% N2 at 37\u00b0C. Final hematocrit in cultures was adjusted to 0.5%. Each culture was set up in sextuplicate in 96-well flat-bottom culture plates. After 96 h plat es were centrifuged at 180 x g for 5 min and culture supernatants were discarded. Pelleted erythrocytes were resuspended in 200 Warrington, Pa.) and incub ated at room temperature for 45 min. The erythrocytes were washed twice with PBS, resuspended in 400 \u00b5l of PBS, and analyzed in a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, Calif.) with CELLQuest program. The hydroethidine emission was d etected in the FL2 channel by logarithmic amplification, and the erythrocytes were gated on the basis of their forward and sideward scatters. A total of 30,000 cells per sample were analyzed. P ercent inhibition was calculated from the geometric mean parasitemias of sextuplicate test and control wells as 100 x (control - test)/control. Statistical significance was calculated by a two-sided t test. Confidence intervals (P < 95%) were calculated by antilogging the confidence limits calculated on the log scale.

D13, A Conserved-Stage-Specific Antigen of P. falciparum 101 Results Identification and sequence analysis of ORF D13 of P. falciparum In order to identify novel secreted and transmembra ne gene products of P. falciparum involved in host-parasite interactions, a P. falciparum cDNA library was screened in an in vitro transcription-translation-translocation assay for genes encoding protein products that are translocated into microsomes and are therefore protected from pr oteinase K digestion (6). One of the plasmids, designated D13, gave rise to a 37-kDa protein product that resisted proteinase K digestion indicative for membrane association or translocatio n (data not shown). The 1.2-kb insert of this plasmid was seque nced and results compared with sequence data of the ongoing P. falciparum Genome Project available at PlasmoDB database [http://plasmodb.org]) (27). One predicted ORF (chr14_1.glm_722) that encompassed the partial sequence of plasmid D13 was identified. The complete predicted ORF D13 is 2,586 bp and codes for 862 amino acid re sidues, with a calculated molecular mass of 99.7 kDa and an pI of 5.30. The three gene prediction algorithms used by the genome project, Glimmer, Genefinder, and Path, predicted identicall y D13. Screening of the PlasmoDB database using the Blast program showe d that D13 is present on chromosome 14 as a single-copy gene. The identifica tion of the predicted initiation codon is supported by the nucleotide context of the ATG start codon, AAATGG, found in ot her genes of P. falciparum and the lack of alternative start codons anywhere in vicinity (4). D13 is intron-less and the protein 1). D13 has no predicted N'-terminal signal sequence and other primary structural charac teristics of an integral membrane protein are also lacking. Analysis of the predicted secondary structure of D13 with the Predictprotein program package (http://bioc.cubic.colombia.edu/pre dictprotein) identified several low-complexity, nonglobular regions separat ing two globular domains located each at the N'- and C'-terminal ends. Searching databases of sequenced genomes of e ukaryotes and prokaryotes demonstrated no significant homolog y to functional domains of other characterized gene products and hence no functional classification can currently be assigned (17). D13 nucleotide sequences of P. falciparum strains K1, MAD20, and IFA9 (13) were compared with the 3D7 sequence available from the genome project. D13 was amplified by CHAPTER 5. D13, A Conserved-Stage-Specific Antigen of P. falciparum 102 PCR from genomic DNA of in vitro-grown blood stage parasites, cloned into pGem5T vector and sequenced as described previously (13). All sequences obtained were identical to the P. falciparum 3D7 sequence apart from one nonsynonymous base exchange at nucleotide position 1444 in P. falciparum K1. This exchange resulted in a conservative amino acid exchange of D to E and was reconfirmed b y a second analysis using an independent PCR product. The nucleotide sequences were deposited in the GenBank with the accession numbers AF491296 to AF491298. Sequence comparison of D13 of P. falciparum using Blast program and the PlasmoDB database [http://plasmoDB.org]) revealed that full-length putative orthologues of present P. knowlesi (chrPkn_008795-6-7284-4963) and P. yoelii (chrPyl_cpy805-2-1337-3844) (Fig. 1). When the D13 amino acid sequence of P. falciparum was compared using the Blast program to putative or thologues in P. knowlesi and P. yoelii , sequence identities were 38 and 41%, respectively. Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that a repeat region with twelve consecuti ve repeats of the pentapeptide motif (K/R)(N/S)(D/E)N(I/M/T) is uniqu e for D13 of P. falciparum and is absent in the orthologues sequences of the other Plasmodium spp. aligned. This repeat region constituted 8% of the molecule. In contrast to the low overall conservation of the D13 sequence, the N'-terminal domain encompassing t he first 158 amino acid residues is highly conserved between the three Plasmodium spp. aligned displaying sequence identities of 94 and 95%, respectively, between P. knowlesi , P. yoelii , and P. falciparum (Fig. 1). Ten strictly conserved cysteine residues with the spacing H 2N-19-C-7-C-6-C-11- C-16-C-14-C-5-C-20-C-7-C-4 are present. Shorter stretches of conserved sequenc e motifs at the C'-terminal end of the D13 amino acid sequen ce were also found (Fig. 1). Stage-specific expression of ORF D13 mRNA in synchr onized blood stage parasites In order to define the transcription pattern of D13 , Northern blot analysis was performed using total RNA isolated from asexual blood stage parasites. After hybridization with a radiolabeled PCR product representing the 5'-terminal 422 bp of D13, one specific signal was detected in RNA from unsynchronized blood stage parasites (data not shown). The size of the transcript was about 7.5 kb by comparison with the RNA size ma rker, indicating the presence of extensive 5'- and 3'-untranslated r egions. In parasites from synchronized cultures, this transcript was only detected in RNA of schizonts collected 48 h after CHAPTER 5. D13, A Conserved-Stage-Specific Antigen of P. falciparum 103 synchronization (Fig. 2A, panel I, lane 8). In order to verify the integrity of the RNA preparations isolated at different times after sync hronization, the blot was rehybridized with a radiolabeled cDNA of pfGAPDH (5). The pfGAPDH-specific hybridization signal of 3.6 kb was observed in each lane confirming that the RNA was i ntact and comparable amounts of RNA were present for hybridization (Fig. 2A, panel I and II). Establishment of D13-specific MAbs and analysis of the expression of D13 protein in blood stage parasites After having established that D13 transcription is largely confined to the schizont stage, we wanted to analyze next whether, when and at what size D13 protein is expressed. The N'- terminal 139 amino acids of D13 were expressed in E. coli as hexahistidine tagged fusion protein using the pETBlue2 expression system. Purification by nitrilotriacetic acid-affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions yielded a recombinant p rotein of the predicted molecular mass of 17 kDa in SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The purified recombinant protein was identified as the expected D13 protein by matrix-assisted laser desor ption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. D13-specific MAbs were generated from mice carrying human heavy and light immunoglobulin chain replacement mutations (18). After repeated immunization with the recombinant fragment of D13 delivered with MPL+ TDM as adjuvant, four anti-D13 MAbs were generated that reacted with the recombinant 17 kDa fragment in ELISA (Table 1). DD1.1 and DD1.2, but n ot DD1.3 and DD1.4, recognized in Western blot analysis of total lysates of unsynchronized blood stage parasites one distinct band of 100 kDa (Fig. 2B and data not shown). The size of t he identified band corresponded to the predicted molecular weight of 99,7 kDa of ORF D13 (chr14_1.glm_722). As a representative example, results obtained with MAb DD1.1 are shown in Fig. 2B, lane 9. In the light of the highly regulated transcription of the D13 gene, we investigated the presence of D13 protein during asexual blood stage development. Aliquots of the lysates from the identical synchronized cultures that had been used for Northe rn blot analysis were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with MAb DD1.1. D1 3 protein was detectable in ring stage parasites (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 to 4), disappeared during the trophozoite stage (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 6), and reappeared in the schizont stage (Fig . 2B, lanes 7 and 8). In the late schizont stage at 48 h postsynchronization, the relative abundance was highest (Fig. 2B, CHAPTER 5. D13, A Conserved-Stage-Specific Antigen of P. falciparum 104 lane 8). Uninfected RBC yielded no detectable signal, confirming the sp ecificity of MAbs DD1.1 for a parasite-encoded protein (Fig. 2B, lane 10). Results obtained with MAb DD1.2 were comparable to DD1.1, although considerably weaker signals were obtained (data not shown). Protein staining of SDS-PAGE demonstrated t hat comparable amounts of total cell lysates from synchronized blood stage parasites were present on nitrocellulose membranes (data not shown). Immunolocalization of D13 in asexual blood stages o f P. falciparum All anti-D13 MAbs were tested for parasite binding using indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). DD1.1 bound strongest to the parasite in IFA, while DD1.2 and DD1.4 yielded only weak signals at high antibody concentrations indicating that the ir affinity for the native D13 protein was considerably lower compa red to DD1.1 (Table 1). Therefore, MAb DD1.1 was used for the characterization of the subcellular localization of D13 protein by IFA and confocal microscopy. In column 1 of Fig. 3, typical results of the indirect IFA are depicted, while in column 2, phase contrast pictures of the corresponding parasites are shown. Specific staining of schizonts (first row), segmenters (second row) a nd released merozoites (third row) are presented. Interestingly , in the merozoite stage, D13 protein seemed to be concentrated in a distinct area of the cell, while during schizont st ages the protein was more evenly distributed in the parasite . Subcellular fractionation of P. falciparum infected erythrocytes In order to investigate whether D13 protein is asso ciated with parasite membranes, cell fractionation experiments were performed and the distribution of D13 protein into sediment and supernatant fractions examined using the anti-D13 MAb DD1.1 for Western blot analysis. Infected erythrocytes were Percoll-purifi ed to maximize parasite protein content, washed thoroughly and hypotonically lysed in water. A membrane-containing fraction was pelleted by ultracentrifugation and analyzed. In the sedimen t fraction derived from infected erythrocytes, a specific band corresponding to the D13 protein could be detected (Fig. 4A, lane 1). This band was considerably weaker in the supernatant fra ction of infected erythrocytes (Fig. 4A, lane 2). To analyze the natu re of the association of D13 with the pellet fraction, total membrane fractions were stripped of peripherally attached pr oteins by treatment at high pH with sodium carbonate. After c entrifugation, D13 protein could be CHAPTER 5. D13, A Conserved-Stage-Specific Antigen of P. falciparum 105 detected in both the pellet and supernatant fractions, indicating that D13 is not a membrane-integral protein (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4). In pellets incubated with water, D13 protein remained in the sediment and was not detect ed in the supernatant fraction (Fig. 4A, lanes 5 and 6). Aliquots of the same samples were blotted onto nitrocellulose and p robed with MAb specific for the abundant membrane-integral pro tein MSP-1. MSP-1 is synthesized as a large ( 195 kDa) precursor that is held by a glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol anchor on the parasite membrane. It undergoes posttranslational proteolyti c processing to produce fragments of 83, 42, 38, and 28 to 30-kDa, which persist as a noncovalently linked complex on the surface of mature merozoites (12). The anti-MSP-1 antibody 7/2 7 is specific for block 1 of MSP-1 present on both the precursor molecule and the processed 83 kDa fragment. As expected, MAb 7/27 detected a major band of 195 kDa in the sediment of untreated, alkaline carbonate and water treated pellets but not in the supernatants (Fig. 4B). The smaller band of 83 kDa represent processing products of MSP-1 (Fig. 4B). These results indicated that D13 is pelleted with the membrane-fraction but it is not a membrane-integral protein. P. falciparum in vitro growth inhibition assays wit anti-D13 having DD1.1, DD1.2, and DD1.4 but not DD1.3 bind to native D13 protein expressed in the invasive stage of the parasite blood stage cycle, we conduct ed in vitro growth inhibition assays for two cycles of merozoit e invasion. At 500 \u00b5g/ml the anti-D13 MAb DD1.1 showed growth inhibitory effects in three independent experiments (47.6% average growth inhibition) conducted with two different batches of antibody preparations (Fig. 5). This inhibition was statisti cally significant as judged by a two-sided t test. At an antibody concentration of 250 \u00b5g/ml, the measured inhibition remained statistically significant, while at 100 \u00b5g/ml the effect was dimi nished by dilution. In contrast DD1.1, the IFA-negative anti-D13 MAb DD1.3 did not interfere with the growth of the parasite in vitro (Fig. 5). CHAPTER 5. D13, A Conserved-Stage-Specific Antigen of P. falciparum 106 Discussion Research conducted in recent years identified the i mportance of both antibody-dependent and cell-mediated mechanisms of immunity to the erythrocytic stage of P. falciparum (15). A protective role for antimalaria antibodies was shown by the pi oneering studies of Cohen et al. (3), who showed that protective immunity could be transferred by using the IgG fraction of sera from immune West African adults. Administration of large doses of antimalaria antibodies to children with acute infec tion resulted in reduction of parasitemia and recovery from clinical illness (3). It was thought that these antibodies interacte d with either late-stage schizonts or free merozoites (2). Furthe r studies showed that antimalarial IgG from immune sera of West Africans protected against P. falciparum infection in East Africa (2). Additionally, transfer of purified, pooled hyperimm une IgG from African adults to Thai patients was found to reduce parasite level. These transfer experiments suggest that geographically diverse parasite strains may share antigens importa nt in inducing protection (22). Hence, there is considerable interest in the molecular identification of parasite proteins as potential targets of vaccine-induced antibodies preventing invasion o f erythrocytes. We are currently characterizing secretory and trans membrane gene products of P. falciparum stage-specifically expressed during schizogony. Expression screening of a P. falciparum cDNA library for in vitro-translated and -translocated cDNA clone D13 encompassing the N'-terminal 1.2-kb fragment of a novel predicted ORF (chr14_1.glm_722). The expression of D13 mRNA turned out to be highly regulated and detectable by Northern blot analysis only in schizont development . Therefore, we decided to characterize D13 in more detail. D13 is a single -copy gene localized on chromosome 14 according to the ongoing P. falciparum genome project and is predicted to code for a 99.7- kDa protein. D13 contains a region of low-complexity co nstituted by 12 tandem repeats of a pentapeptide sequence motif that is followed by shorter homopolymer runs of asparagine residues. Many of the malaria antigens that have been charact erized in P. falciparum contain tandem arrays of relatively short sequences . A number of characteristics allow distinctions to be drawn among such malaria antigens. One group is characterized b y one centrally located block of tandem repeats that constitutes a significant proportion of the polypeptide chain. This group includes the S antigens, MSP-2 and the circumsporozoite protein (1). Other antigens contain a single set of repeats comprising a minor segment of CHAPTER 5. D13, A Conserved-Stage-Specific Antigen of P. falciparum 107 the polypeptide chain. This group includes the thro mbospondin-related adhesive protein, the exported protein 1, and also D13, since the repeat region constitutes about 8% of the whole molecule (1). Other characteristics that distinguish between different repeat- containing antigens are diversity of repeat sequenc es and variation in the number of tandemly repeated sequences. Sequence diversity can be observed both within bloc ks of repeats and between equivalent repeat segments in allelic g ene products (1). In D13, there is variation between the 12 sequence repeats that are based mainly on single base pair exchanges (data not shown). Surprisingly, sequence polymorphism of the low-complexity region of D13 of P. falciparum in the laboratory is olates 3D7, K1, and MAD20 and the field isolate IFA9 was not detected although polymorphism of antigens of P. falciparum is usually particularly extensive in repeat regions of the molecules (1). In order to study whether and when D13 protein is e xpressed during asexual blood stages, the N'-terminal 138 amino acids were expressed in E. coli as hexahistidine-tagged p rotein, purified, and used to raise specific MAbs in mice. Immunogeni city of the recombinant protein was low but we were able to establish sever al anti-D13 MAbs. The anti-D13 MAbs DD1.1 and DD1.2 recognized a of 100 kDa in lysates of blood stage parasit es in Western blot analysis. This size of the band corresponded t o the predicted molecular weight of D13. In IFA, the cross-reactivity of MAb DD1.1, DD1.2, and DD1.4 with the native parasite protein was established. Western blotting and IFA both showed t hat the abundance of D13 protein was highest in schizonts. It decline d during ring stage while D13 was undetectable in trophozoites. D13 protein was detectable for about 30 h during the asexual blood stage cycle, while D13 specific mRNA was present only dur ing the last 6 h of schizont development. Hence, the D13 protein was de tectable four to five times longer than the D13-specific mRNA during one asexual developmental cycle. The strict regulation of D13 mRNA expression togeth er with the highest expression of D13 protein in schizonts suggested an involvement of the protein in the complex biologica l processes of merozoite development, rupture of mature schizon ts, release of merozoites and invasion of fresh erythrocytes. Therefore, we used an in vitro parasite growth inhibition assay to test whether anti-D13 MAb influence the progression of t he infective cycle. The results showed that incorporation of the strongest parasite binding anti-D13 MAb DD1.1 inhibited parasite growth by an average of several independent exper had no parasite growth. These results CHAPTER 5. D13, A Conserved-Stage-Specific Antigen of P. falciparum 108 indicate that the affinity and/or the epitope recognized by the anti-D13 MAbs might be important for the inhibitory function. Currently, it is not possi ble to assign exactly the subcellular localization of D13 by IFA using confoc al microscopy. D13 is not obviously expressed on the surface of merozoites like the MSPs but might be rather concen trated on one distinct pole of the merozoite. The combined re sults of the in vitro parasite growth inhibition assays with the cell fractionation experiments indicate that D13 is duri ng blood stage development accessible to antibodies in solut ion and becomes enriched in the pelleted fraction of malaria parasites. However, more detailed analyses, including immuno- electron microscopy, are essential to determine the exact subcellular lo calization of D13 protein. Currently, the correlation of in vitro growth inhib itory activities of antibodies with their potential protective capacity in vivo is incompletely understood. Active immunization studies in animal models are therefore essential to demonstrate unequ ivocally that the N'- terminal domain of D13 might be a target of protect ive antibody responses in vivo. The fact that D13 is conserved in four parasite iso lates may suggest that it is not under immune pressure, although sera from donors naturally exposed to malaria contain antibodies reacting with the recombinant N'-terminal domain of D13 in ELISA (unpublished observation). The high level of sequen ce conservation is in marked contrast to MSPs like MSP-1 and MSP-2 (7, 8, 10). In contrast, the rhoptry-associated protein 2 displays very limited sequence diversity (24). It has been demons trated that antibodies raised against rhoptry-associated protein 2-derived peptides reduce parasite growth in vitro, indicating that conserved proteins can be targeted by parasite inhibitory ant ibodies (26). Besides offering the possibility to improve the ann otations of the P. falciparum genome through comparative analysis, animal models represent a potent source of information concerning protein function within the context of the infected host or vector (30). Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of pu tative D13 orthologues in P. falciparum, P. knowlesi, and P. yoelii showed that the N'-terminal domain is highly conserved, while the rest of the molecule displayed extensive sequence variat ion. The high degree of amino acid sequence conservation between rodent, monkey and human malaria species suggests a conserved biological role of the N'-terminal domain in malaria. The prominence of synonymous versus nonsynonymous base exchanges in t his domain (data not shown) suggests that apart from differences in the codon usage in different Plasmodium CHAPTER 5. D13, A Conserved-Stage-Specific Antigen of P. falciparum 109 species (28) a negative selection pressure might be operating to preserve a distinct three- dimensional structure. The conserved N'-terminal do main of D13 might bind to and interact tightly with other proteins to conduct its biological function(s). Functional investigations of the biological role(s) of D13 will probably furt her our understanding of molecular mechanism(s) mediating evasion, recogniti on, invasion and subsequent establishment of the parasites in host cells.

Time points analyzed were 0 to 6 h , 6 to 12 h, 12 to 18 h, 18 to 24 h, 24 to 30 h, 30 to 36 h, 36 to 42 h and 42 to 48 h (lan es 1 to 8) after synchronization. Panel II shows the blot rehybridized with an [ -32 P]-dCTP-labeled probe of cDNA of pfGAPDH (5). (B) Western blot analysis of total lysates of blood stage parasites. Total lysates of infected RBC were separated by SDS-10% PAGE under r educing conditions and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Samples were taken at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, and 48 h (lanes 1 to 8) after synchronization. Lysates of un synchronized infected RBC (lane 9) and uninfected RBC (lane 10) were also loaded. The blot was incubated with anti-D13 MAb DD1.1 and developed using the ECL system. MAb DD1.1 recognized a single protein band of about 100 kDa in most lanes containing lysates o f infected, but not in uninfected RBC. CHAPTER 5.

P. falciparum 's GAPDH: Potential drug target 120 Summary Spatial and temporal distribution of the glycolytic enzymes glyceraldehydes-3- phosphate dehydrogenase (pfGAPDH) and aldolase (pfAldolase) o f Plasmodium were investigated using specific mAbs and indirect immun ofluorescence analysis (IFA). Both glycolytic enzymes co-localized during ring and tro phozoite stages of both liver and asexual blood stage parasites. During schizogony, pfGAPDH became associated with the periphery of the parasites and eventually accumulat ed in the apical region of merozoites while pfAldolase showed no segregation. Sub-cellula r fractionation experiments demonstrated that pfGAPDH was found in both the mem brane-containing pellet and the supernatant fraction of parasite lysates. In contra st, pfAldolase was only found in the supernatant fraction. A quantitative binding assay showed that pfGAPDH could be recruited to HeLa membranes onse cytos olic components to membranes is conserved in evolution. Two overlapping fragments of pfGAPDH (residues 1 - 192 and 133 - 337) were evaluated in the microsomal binding assay. We found that the N'-terminal fragment competitively inhibited Rab2-stimulated pf GAPDH recruitment. mediating the pendent membrane-recruitment is located in the N'-terminus combined results suggest that pfGAPDH exerts non-glycolytic function(s) in P. falciparum , possibly vesicular transport and apical organelles. Key words: / Rab2 /evolution CHAPTER 6. P. falciparum 's GAPDH: Potential drug target 121 Introduction Malaria caused by the apicomplexan parasite Plasmodium falciparum is one of the most important parasitic diseases in man (World Health O rganization, 2001) (Sachs and Malaney, 2002) Sporozoites injected into a human ho st by the bite of an infective mosquito invade hepatocytes and, after schizogony, release t housands of merozoites capable of invading red blood cells (RBC). Malaria pathogenesi s is associated with this intracellular blood-stage of the parasite's life cycle involving repeated rounds of invasion, growth and schizogony in the erythrocyte. Trophozoite, schizon t and merozoite stages develop during the liver stage that lasts ~ 5 - 7 days in man, whi le ring, trophozoite, schizont and merozoite stages are distinguished during asexual b lood stage development that takes ~ 48 h. P. falciparum targets a distinct set of proteins to each of the a pical secretory organelles (Preiser et al., 2000). These proteins enable merozoites to selecti vely adhere and invade host cells and, once within, to cause modifi cations of the host cell (Preiser et al., 2000; Preiser et al., 2002). Rhoptries appear to be formed by fusion of vesicles derived from the Golgi cisternae (Bannister et al., 2000). The rhoptry associated protein 1 (RAP-1) has been localized exclusively to rhoptries (Clark et al., 1987) and can be used as a marker for the localization of the apical complex (Howard et al., 1998; Moreno et al., 2001). Recent results suggest that the parasite uses a \"just in time\" developmental strategy where compartments of the secretory pathway are strategic ally positioned when and where they are needed during organelle biogenesis (Kocken et al., 1998; Noe et al., 2000). However, there are still major unanswered questions related to the components involved in the secretory pathway of P. falciparum (Ward et al., 1997; Albano et al., 1999; Wiser et al., 1999). In mammalian cells and in yeast, a multitude of pr oteins have been shown to play a role in sub-cellular trafficking including the Rab protein family. The Rab proteins are GTPases that regulate vesicular traffic between spe cific endocytic pathways (Nuoffer and Balch, 1994). When t hese proteins are membrane associated, they promote recruitment of cytosolic c omponents that function in vesicle formation, docking and fusion. For example, the act ivated form of Rab2 initiates in mammalian cells a cascade of events leading to the recruitment of soluble factors to pre- CHAPTER 6. P. falciparum 's GAPDH: Potential drug target 122 Golgi intermediates that ultimately leads to the re lease of (Tisdale et 1999). Int erestingly, one of the soluble factors recruited has been identified as gl yceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, EC 1.2.1.12) (Tisdale, as a key enzyme in glycolysis and catalyses the reversible oxidative p hosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3- phosphate to 1,3 diphosphoglycerate in the presence of NAD + and inorganic phosphate. There is substantial evidence suggesting that GAPDH might be involved in additional cellular activities unrelated to its role in glycol ysis (Sirover, 1999). Multiple studies from different groups employing independent methods have demonstrated the participation of one or more GAPDH isoforms in membrane fusion and t rafficking in biological systems (Lopez Vinals et al., 1987; Robbins et al., 1995; Volker and 1997; al., 2001; Bressi et al., 2001; Glaser et al., 2002). Guided by the crystal structures of Trypanos omatidae GAPDH's in comparison with human GAPDH, an structure-based approach of de signing competitive and selective inhibitors of Glycolysis was successfully followed (Verlinde et al., 2001). In the current study we have established monoclona l antibodies (mAbs) specific for pfGAPDH and pfAldolase. Co-localization studies by con-focal microscopy and sub-cel lular fractionation in combination with ent assay provide evidence that pfGAPDH exerts non-glycolytic functions. CHAPTER 6. P. falciparum 's GAPDH: Potential drug target 123 Results Generation and Characterization of Monoclonal Antib odies Specific for GAPDH and Aldolase of having produced enzymatically active recombin ant pfGAPDH (Daubenberger et al., 2000), we wanted to investigate whether this enzyme is involved in additional non- glycolytic functions. Therefore, mAbs specific for pfAldolase and pfGAPDH were established from mice immunized with the respective recombinant proteins (D\u00f6beli et al., 1990; Daubenberger et al., 2000). These mAbs were tested in Western blot anal ysis for their antigen specificity (Figure 1) using infected red blood cells (RBC) (lanes 1), uninfected RBC (lanes 2), recombinant pfAldolase, ( lanes 3) and pfGAPDH (lanes 4). SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining demons trated the purity of the preparations of recombinant proteins (Figure 1 A). Out of a panel of anti-pfAldolase mAbs, two, design ated P.41-2/3-7 and P.41-1/2-7, recognized in total lysates of infected but not uni nfected RBC a band of 41 kDa, representing the predicted molecular weight of pfAl dolase (Figure 1 B, lanes 1, 2). Additionally, the recombinant pfAldolase but not pf GAPDH was identified by P41-2/3-7 (Figure 1 B, lanes 3, 4). Results obtained with the second anti-pfAldolase mAb P.41-1/2-7 reactive in Western blot analysis were comparable ( data not shown). The other anti- pfAldolase mAbs were not reactive in Western blot a nalysis but precipitated from metabolically labeled blood stage parasites one maj or band of 41 kDa. All anti-pfAldolase mAbs stained infected RBC in IFA (data not shown). Two anti-pfGAPDH mAbs, designated 1.4 and 1.10, wer e isolated from mice immunized with recombinant pfGAPDH (Daubenberger et al., 2000). Western blot analysis showed that both mAbs recognized the recombinant pfGAPDH b ut not pfAldolase (Figure 1, C, D, lanes 3, 4). Also, in total lysates of infected RBC (Figure 1, C, D, lane 1) but not in uninfected RBC (Figure 1, C, D, lane 2) a protein o f 36 kDa, the predicted molecular weight of pfGAPDH, was detected. Taken together, da ta presented in Figure 1 showed that we obtained mAbs specific for the glycolytic enzyme s Aldolase and GAPDH of P. falciparum that are not cross-reactive with human erythrocyte proteins. In order to CHAPTER 6. P. falciparum 's GAPDH: Potential drug target 124 delineate closer the epitope recognized by the anti -pfGAPDH mAbs, we produced two fragments of recombinant proteins in E. coli encompassing the first 192 N'-terminal or the C'-terminal 204 amino acids of pfGAPDH, respectivel y. Both fragments overlapped by a stretch of 59 amino acids. Separation by SDS-PAGE a nd staining with Coomassie blue showed that the affinity purified recombinant pfGAP DH-fragments were of the predicted molecular sizes of 24,2 kDa and 23,0 kDa, (Figure 2 , lanes 2, 3). Immuno-detection with mAb 1.4 and mAb 1.10 (data not shown) demonstrated that both recognized the complete pfGAPDH (lane 1) and the N'-terminal fragment there of (lane 3), whereas the C'-terminal fragment (lane 2) was not detected. Hence, the anti -pfGAPDH mAbs 1.4 and 1.10 recognized an epitope located within the first 192 amino acid residues of pfGAPDH. Sub-Cellular Distribution of pfGAPDH and pfAldolase During Asexual Blood-Stage Parasite Development In order to assess whether the two glycolytic enzym es co-localize during P. falciparum asexual parasite development, indirect IFA and con- focal microscopy was performed. In columns I and II of Figure 3 A, results obtained wi th the anti-pfGAPDH and anti- pfAldolase mAbs are shown in green and red, respect ively. In column III, the super- positioning of both images given in columns 1 and 2 and in column 4 the phase contrast of the parasites is depicted. Cultured parasites were synchronized and at 10 h (row 1), 20 h (row 2), 30 h (row 3) and 40 h (row 4) post synchro nization aliquots of cells were removed and analyzed. The pictures obtained at time points 10 h and 20 h demonstrated that pfAldolase and pfGAPDH were co-localized in the ear ly stages of parasite development since both, the green and the red signals were supe r-imposed resulting in orange signals. Cells harvested 40 h post synchronization displayed a different distribution pattern. The green signal of the anti-pfGAPDH staining was large ly confined to the periphery of the schizont while the red signal of the anti-pfAldolas e staining remained distributed equally throughout the schizont. In column III of row 4, th e overlay of the images showed a distinct central region stained in red and a periph eral region stained in orange. Therefore, pfGAPDH seemed to be enriched in the periphery of t he developing schizont relative to pfAldolase. At the time point of 30 h this segregat ion process has started already as indicated by the red signal in the center of the pa rasites (column III, row 3). CHAPTER 6. P. falciparum 's GAPDH: Potential drug target 125 Since the spatial separation of pfGAPDH and pfAldol ase could be observed in the late schizont stage, we wanted to see whether pfGAPDH wa s enriched in the sub-cellular region containing the apical complex of P. falciparum . Single merozoites after schizont rupture were analyzed similarly as described above. In row 1 of Figure 2 B, results of IFA and con-focal microscopy using anti-pfGAPDH (green) and anti-pfAldolase (red) mAbs are shown. The overlay in Figure 3 B, column III, r ow 1, shows that regions stained in green and red appeared indicating that pfGAPDH and pfAldolase were preferentially localized at opposite cell poles. Additionally, reg ions of overlapping fluorescence signals (orange) were present. In Figure 3 B, row 2, result s obtained with anti-pfGAPDH (green) and anti-RAP-1 mAbs (red) demonstrated that pfGAPDH was preferentially co-localized with RAP-1 that is associated with the apical compl ex of the merozoites (Clark et al., 1987). Immunolocalization Studies of pfGAPDH and pfAldolas e in Liver Stage Parasites In order to analyze whether the spatial and tempora l changes in the sub-cellular distribution of pfAldolase and pfGAPDH is comparabl e between liver and asexual blood- stages of P. falciparum , human liver cells were infected with sporozoites isolated from salivary glands of infected Anopheles mosquitoes. T he liver parenchymal cells were stained on days 2, 4 and 7 after infection with ant i-pfGAPDH and anti-pfAldolase mAbs and analyzed by con-focal microscopy (Figure 4). In non-mature liver schizonts (days 2 and 4), both glycolytic enzymes were co-localized i n the cytosol (Figure 4, rows 1 and 2). In contrast, in maturing schizonts (day 7), pfGAPDH seemed to be localized at a higher concentration in the periphery of the schizont whil e pfAldolase remained evenly distributed (Figure 4, row 3). Hence, the enrichmen t of pfGAPDH in the periphery of the developing schizont in comparison to pfAldolase was comparable to the results obtained with asexual blood stage parasites. Sub-Cellular Fractionation of P. falciparum Infected Erythrocytes The combined results obtained by IFA and con-focal microscopy of liver and asexual blood stage parasites strongly indicated that pfGAP DH and pfAldolase are not distributed CHAPTER 6. P. falciparum 's GAPDH: Potential drug target 126 equally during schizont and merozoite stages. In or der to verify these observations, cell fractionation experiments of blood stage schizonts were performed and the distribution of pfGAPDH and pfAldolase in sediment and supernatant fractions examined. Schizonts of blood stage parasites of strains K1 and FVO were en riched up to 95 - 99% purity using Percoll gradient centrifugation as described (Wahlg ren et al., 1983). Purified parasites were washed thoroughly, lysed by repeated cycles of freeze/thaw in water and the membrane and sediment fractions were separated by u ltracentrifugation. Aliquots of these fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and probed with anti- pfGAPDH mAbs, respectively. One specific band corresponding to pfGAPDH could be detected in both the pellet (Figur e 5 A, lanes 1 and 3) and supernatant fractions (Figure 5 A, lanes 2 and 4). In contrast, the anti-pfAldolase mAb detected exclusively in the supernatant fraction one single band (Figure 5 B). Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments and indic ated that a substantial fraction of pfGAPDH was associated with the membrane-containing , pelleted sub-cellular fraction of the parasite obtained after ultracentrifugation, wh ile pfAldolase resided in the supernatant fraction. Mammalian Rab2 Stimulates pfGAPDH Recruitment to He La Cell Derived Microsomal Membranes After having established that pfGAPDH was detectabl e in the membrane-containing sub- cellular fraction, we wanted to investigate the fun ctional basis of membrane recruitment of pfGAPDH. Rab2 protein and a peptide representing t he N'-terminal thirteen amino acids of Rab2 (Rab2 13-mer) have been reported previously to stimulate mammalian GAPDH binding to membranes (Tisdale, 2001). Using sequenc e data from the P. genome project (http://plasmodb.org), potential R ab2 homol ogue displayed an overall 75% identity at the amino acid level with human Rab2 an d was highly conserved in the domain that stimulates Rab2 dependent recruitment of solub le factors (AYAYLFKYIIIGD Rab2 versus PYEYLFKYIIIGD of pfRab2). We perf ormed a quantitative binding assay to measure pfGAPDH recruitment using microsom es prepared from whole cell homogenates of HeLa cells as described (Tisdale and Balch, 1996; Tisdale, 2001). Briefly, CHAPTER 6. P. 's Potential drug target 127 salt-washed HeLa microsomes pre-incubated increasing Rab2 protein supplemented with recombina nt pfGAPDH for 10 min on ice. Cytosol and GTP S were added and the membranes incubated for 15 min at 32 \u00baC. The membranes were collected by centrifugation and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-pfGAPDH mAb 1.4 to asse ss the level of membrane-bound pfGAPDH. As shown in Figure 6 A, Rab2 peptide and R ab2 protein promoted pfGAPDH membrane association in a dose-dependent manner. Th e amount of membrane bound pfGAPDH increased ~ 5-fold when incubated with 100 \u00b5 of Rab2 peptide. In order to confirm that mAb 1.4 does not cross-react with huma n or rat GAPDH also present in microsomes, rat and SDS-PAGE, transferred nitrocellulose and immuno- blotted. The results confirmed that mAb 1.4 lacks cross-reactivity with rat liver or hu man GAPDH (Figure 6 B) and indicated that Rab2 protein and Rab2 peptide stimulated pfGAP DH recruitment to membrane in a dose-dependent manner. The N'-Terminal Fragment of pfGAPDH Binds to Micros omal Membranes in Response to Rab2 After establishing that pfGAPDH was recruited to mi crosomal membranes in response to Rab2 and Rab2 peptide, we investigated which domain of pfGAPDH was involved in this interaction. Salt-washed HeLa microsomes were ncubated with Rab2 protein sup plemented with recombinant pfGAPDH N'-terminal domain (residues 1 - 192) for 1 0 min on ice. Cytosol and GTP S were then added, and the microsomes incubated. The membranes were collected by centrifugation, separated by SDS-PAGE and immuno-bl otted. Results shown in Figure 7 A demonstrated that Rab2 and Rab2 peptide stimulated membrane recruitment of the N'- terminal fragment in a dose-dependent manner. Next we wanted to learn whether the N'- terminal fragment could effectively compete for mem brane binding with the full-length recombinant Rab2 and supplemented with the i ndicated concentrations of N'-terminal fragment for 10 min on ice (Figure 7 B). Recombinan t pfGAPDH at a constant concentration, cytosol and GTP S were added and the membranes incubated as describ ed CHAPTER 6. P. falciparum 's GAPDH: Potential drug target 128 above. To terminate the reaction, membranes were co llected by centrifugation and then analyzed as above. Results demonstrated that the N' -terminal fragment competed with recruitment of the full-length pfGAPDH (Figure 7 B) . In contrast, the C'-terminal fragment of pfGAPDH (encompassing residues 133 - 337) did no t interfere with the ability of Rab2 or Rab2 peptide to recruit full-length recombinant pfGAPDH to membrane (Figure 7 C). In summary, these results indicated that the N'-termin al fragment of pfGAPDH contains the domain leading to Rab2 dependent recruitment to HeL a cell derived microsomal membranes. CHAPTER 6. P. falciparum 's GAPDH: Potential drug target 129 Discussion In this report we provide evidence that GAPDH of P. falciparum is partially segregated in the late stages of parasite development from the cy tosol, suggesting additional non- glycolytic function(s) of this enzyme. First, using IFA and con-focal microscopy, we found that the two glycolytic enzymes pfGAPDH and pfAldol ase co-localize in early stages of both liver and asexual blood-stage parasite develop ment. However, during schizogony pfGAPDH was in comparison to pfAldolase enriched in the periphery of the developing parasites. Hence, pfGAPDH might be concentrated dur ing schizogony in the same sub- cellular region where vesicular-tubular clusters an d the developing apical complex are observed (Bannister et al., 2000). Second, sub-cellular fractionation experime nts demonstrated that pfGAPDH was in contrast to pfAldo lase easily detected in both the membrane-containing pellet and supernatant frac tions. Third, a quantitative recruitment assay showed that pfGAPDH an d the N'-terminal domain thereof were recruited to HeLa cell derived microsomes in a Rab2 dependent manner. These results are consistent with other reports sh owing that GAPDH exerts non- glycolytic functions in mammalian cells (Sirover, 1 999). Protein transport in the early secretory pathway of mammalian cells requires Rab2 (Tisdale et to pre-Golgi intermediates and mediates the recruitmen t of soluble factors including GAPDH to these structures (Tisdale, 2001). The amino term inus of Rab2 (residues 1 - 13) is essential for Rab2 activity. Deletion of these resi dues result in loss of function, whereas the Rab2 peptide mimics the downstream enlistment of ac cessory proteins similar to the intact Rab2 protein (Tisdale and Balch, 1996; Tisdale and Jackson, 1998). In the light of the sub- cellular fractionation experiments and the evolutio nary conservation of the functional domain of pfRab2, we investigated whether recombina nt pfGAPDH could be recruited to HeLa cell microsomes after incubation with mammalia n Rab2. Our results suggested that the Rab2 mediated recruitment of GAPDH to membrane is also operating in P. falciparum . Results with fragments of pfGAPDH demonstrated furt her that the N'-terminal fragment of pfGAPDH encompass the domain interacting with Rab2 leading to membrane recruitment. Several independent groups reported that GAPDH is i nvolved in membrane fusion and trafficking (Lopez Vinals et al., 1987; Han et al., 1998; Hessler et al., 1998; de Arcuri CHAPTER 6. P. falciparum 's GAPDH: Potential drug target 130 et al., 1999; Bressi et al., 2001; Glaser et al., 2002) and in the modulation of the cytoskeleton by promoting actin polymerization and 1983; Reiss et al., 1996; Tisdale, 2002). Th ese observations lead to the hypothesis that mammalian GAPDH is recruited to tubulin associ ated vesicles in and phosphorylation res ults in a conformational change of GAPDH altering its interactions with tubulin and fa cilitating membrane fusion by de- inhibition of GAPDH. After membrane fusion, GAPDH i s released from the vesicles in an ATP- dependent manner followed by de-phosphorylatio n of GAPDH (Glaser et al., 2002). Our data indicate that the proposed mechanism of GA PDH involvement in the secretory system of mammalian cells might be conserved in api complexan organisms. This is particularly interesting since the phylum apicomple xa is most closely related to the ciliates and dinoflagellates, branching off from the eukaryo tic lineage prior to the divergence of animals, fungi and plants (Roos et al., 1999). What could be the possible non-glycolytic role of p fGAPDH during parasite development? It is tempting to speculate that the d istribution of pfGAPDH in schizont and merozoite stages in the sub-cellular region close t o the apical complex implicates that pfGAPDH could be involved in the fusion of vesicles during biogenesis of the organelles of the apical complex. Alternatively, pfGAPDH might participate in the interaction between vesicular or intracellular compartment(s) w ith the cytoskeleton mediating the positioning of the apical complex during its biogen esis. In malaria parasites, no energy reserves are stored and almost all metabolized glucose passes through the anaerobic Embden-Meyerho ff-Parnas pathway resulting in a 100-fold increase in glucose consumption of infecte d RBC versus uninfected cells (Roth, Jr. et al., 1988). The obligate dependence on glycolysis for A TP production combined with the possible involvement of pfGAPDH in other biolog ical functions renders this conserved, single copy gene product a particularly attractive target for malaria drug development. PfGAPDH has only limited (63.5%) amino acid sequenc e identity with human erythrocytic GAPDH. Certain sequence features at the active site (an insertion at position 206 and an amino acid exchange at position 198) are unique for the parasite enzyme and suggest that selective inhibitors of pfGAPDH could be developed (Daubenberger et al., 2000). This is supported by the successful development of anti-try panosomatid parasite drugs like CHAPTER 6. P. falciparum 's GAPDH: Potential drug target 131 adenosine analogues as potent and selective GAPDH i nhibitors following a structure based drug design approach (Bressi et al., 2001; Verlinde et al., 2001). CHAPTER 6. P. falciparum 's GAPDH: Potential drug target 132 Materials and Methods Expression and Purification of Recombinant pfGAPDH and N'- and C'-Terminal Fragments Thereof The complete cDNA of pfGAPDH was amplified from a c DNA library of P. falciparum strain K1 by containin Nde I and Xho I sites as described (Daubenberger et al., 2000). For the amplification of the N- and C'- terminal fragments of pfGAPDH the following primer combinations digested with Nde I and Xho I, gel purified and then cloned in frame into the bacterial expression vector pET28a+ (Novagen). Comp etent E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells (Novagen) were transformed with the recombinant pET 28a+ plasmids and expression of the His 6-tagged fusion protein was induced by the addition of 1 m M isopropyl thiogalactoside (IPTG) (Calbiochem) at 0.6 OD 600 . E. coli cells expressing recombinant protein were collected by centrifugation and resusp ended in lysis buffer (50 m M NaH 2P0 4, 300 m M NaCl, 10 m M imidazole) with 1 mg/ml lysozyme (Appligene Oncor) for 30 min. on ice and sonicated. After centrifugation at 10 000 g the supernatant wa s loaded onto a Ni 2+ -NTA agarose column ( Qiagen) and purified according to the manufacturer' s instructions. The recombinant protein was recovered using elution buffer (50 m M NaH 2P04, pH 8.0, 300 m M NaCl, 500 m M imidazole). After analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, purified proteins were pooled, di alyzed against a buffer containing 25 mM Tris / 500 m M (NH 4)2SO 4 / 0,1 m M NAD + / 2 m M TCEP / 2 m M DTT and stored at 4 \u00baC. The recombinant proteins differed from the pred icted natural parasite protein by the additional N'-terminal amino acid sequence MGSSHHHH HHSSGLVPRGSH. CHAPTER 6. P. falciparum 's GAPDH: Potential drug target 133 Generation of Hybridoma Cell Lines Producing anti-p fGAPDH and anti-pfAldolase immunized with GAPDH (Daubenberger et al., 2000) or pfAldolase (D\u00f6beli et al., 1990) and hybridoma cell lines were generated essentially as described (Pluschke et al., 1998). The hybridoma cell lines secreting anti- pfAldolase mAb were generated from Balb/c mice and contained a light and 1 heavy chains. In contrast, hybridoma cell lines producing anti-pfGAPDH antibodies were generated from mice carrying immunoglobulin heavy c hain 2a and light chain replacement mutations (Pluschke et al., 1998). Fusion with these mice yielded either mouse light chain or human light chain containing mAbs. These mAbs are ideall y suited for double staining immunofluorescence analy ses in conjunction with mouse chain carrying mAbs obtained from un-mutated mouse strain s. Accordingly, the anti-pfGAPDH mAbs 1.4 and 1.10 express IgG2a: and P.41- doma supernatant by affinity chromatography HighTrap Protein A anti -RAP-1 mAb 5-2 (IgG1: ) has been described previously (Moreno et al., 2001). Cultivation and Sub-Cellular Fractionation of P. falciparum Blood Stage Parasites and Western Blot Analysis P. falciparum strain 3D7 parasites were cultured and synchronized using standard methods (Matile and Pink, 1990) with two sorbitol synchroni zation steps one cycle before harvesting. Synchronization was confirmed and the l evel of parasitemia estimated by standard microscopy. SDS-PAGE was performed essenti ally as described (Daubenberger et al., 2000). Briefly, total cell lysates of cultures of P. falciparum were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8,0. The cells were lysed in 10 ml of 0.15% saponin in SSC (150 m M, NaCl, 15 m M sodium citrate) and haemoglobin-depleted iRBC were collected by centrifugation at 2000 g for 20 min and separated on 12% SDS-PAGE, and then transferred electrophoretically to Schuell). were incubated with blocking buffer CHAPTER 6. P. falciparum 's GAPDH: Potential drug target 134 (0.1% Tween / 5% skimmed milk powder in PBS) and th en incubated with purified anti- GAPDH mAbs 1.4, mAb 1.10 and anti-pfAldolase mAb P. 41-2/3-7 for 1 h. After several washing steps, blots were incubated with appropriat ely ely diluted goat anti-mouse peroxidase antibodies (Sigma) developed using ECL s ystem following manufacturer's instructions (Figure 2). For sub-cellular fractionation experiments, late st age infected erythrocytes were enriched to 95 - 99% using 60% Percoll gradient as described (Wahlgren et al., 1983). Cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by three cycles of freeze/thaw in 10 volumes of double-distilled water. Total pell et and supernatant fractions were collected by ultracentrifugation at 100 000 g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. Samples were harvested and solubilized in denaturing SDS sample buffer and equ ivalent amounts of each sample were subjected to Western blot analysis. Western blot an alysis was conducted with anti- pfGAPDH mAb 1.4 and P.41-2/3-7. Indirect Immunofluorescence Analysis of Asexual Blo od-Stage Parasites IFA of blood-stage parasites was conducted essentia lly as described (Daubenberger et al., 2000). P. falciparum cultures were synchronized twice and aliquots of ce lls were removed for staining every 10 h. Multi-test immunofluoresce nce microscopy slides (Flow Labs, Switzerland) were pre-treated with 0.01% (w/v) poly L-lysine (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature and washed. Infected RBC were washed a nd mixed with two volumes of a solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Tr iton X-100. Droplets of 30 \u00b5l cell suspension were added to each well and incubated fo r 30 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked with 100 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA in PBS. Cells were incubated with of anti-GAPDH mAb 1.4 and anti -pfAldolase mAb P.41-2/3-7 and after several washing steps, cells were incubated w ith secondary antibodies specific for mouse or immunglobulin light chains conjugated with TXRD an d FITC, respectively (Southern Biotechnology Associates). The immuno-rea ctivity was observed using a Leica CHAPTER 6. P. falciparum 's GAPDH: Potential drug target 135 TCS NT con-focal microscope. Images were acquired w ith a 63x Plan-Apochromat oil immersion objective (NA 1.32). Pinhole settings wer e 1 airy unit for all images that were processed with Imaris (Bitplane, Switzerland) and A dobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop (Mountainview, USA). Immunofluorescence Analysis of Liver Stage Parasite s Primary cultures of human hepatocytes were prepared from liver segments taken from adult patients during partial hepatectomy. Hepatocy tes were isolated using the two-step enzymatic perfusion technique with minor modificati ons (Guguen-Guillouzo et al., 1982). Briefly, the hepatic cells were successively perfus ed with HEPES buffer and 0.05% collagenase D (Roche), dissociated, and viable cell s were isolated on a 36% Percoll gradient. Cells were seeded at density of 1.4 x 10 5 per cm 2 in eight-chamber permanox Lab-Tek culture slides (Nalge Nunc International) c tail collagen I (Beckton- Dickinson) and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 4% CO 2 atmosphere. Hepatocytes were cultivated in Williams medium E (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies), 2 m M L-glutamine (Life Technologies), 1 m M sodium pyruvate (Bio- Whittaker), 10 mg l -1 insulin (Sigma), 200 U ml -1 penicillin and 200 \u00b5g ml -1 streptomycin (Life Technologies). After complete adherence of th e cells, culture medium was replaced by fresh medium supplemented with 10 -7 M dexamethasone (Sigma). P. falciparum NF54 strain sporozoites aseptic o stephensi salivary glands were co-cultured with hepatocytes essentiall y as described (Ponnudurai et al., 1982). After the indicated time periods cultures we re washed, fixed in cold methanol and the liver schizonts were labeled with mAb as descri bed for the blood-stage parasites. Samples were analyzed by con-focal microscopy. Quantitative Microsomal-Binding Reaction HeLa cells were washed three times with ice-cold PB S. The cells were scraped off the dish with a rubber policeman into 10 m M Hepes (pH 7.2) and 250 m M mannitol, then broken with 15 passes of a 27 gauge syringe. The b roken cells were pelleted at 500 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, and the supernatant removed and re-c entrifuged at 20,000 g for 20 min at CHAPTER 6. P. falciparum 's GAPDH: Potential drug target 136 4\u00b0C. The pellet containing ER, pre-Golgi, and Golg i membranes was washed with 1 M KCl in 10 m M Hepes, (pH 7.2) for 15 min on ice to remove periph erally associated proteins, then centrifuged at 20,000 g for 20 min at 4\u00baC. The membranes were resuspended in 10 m M Hepes (pH 7.2) and 250 m M mannitol and employed in the binding reaction (Tisdale, 2001). Membranes (30 \u00b5g of total protein) were added to a reaction mixture that contained 27.5 m M Hepes (pH 7.2), 2.75 m M MgOAc, 65 m M KOAc, 5 m M EGTA, 1.8 m M CaCl 2, 1 m M ATP, 5 m M creatine phosphate, and 0.2 U of rabbit muscle creatine kinase. Recombinant Rab2, and C'-terminal pfGAPDH domains were added at the concentrations indicated under \"Results\" and the reaction mix incubated on i ce for 10 min. Rat liver cytosol (50 \u00b5g) and 2.0 \u00b5M GTP S were then added, and the reactions shifted to 32 \u00b0C and incubated for 15 min. The binding reaction was terminated by transferring the samples to ice and then centrifuged at 20,000 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The pellet was resuspended in sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to ni trocellulose in 25 m M Tris, pH 8.3, 192 m M glycine, 20% methanol. The blot was blocked in TB S which contained 5% non- fat dry milk and 0.5% Tween-20, incubated with a mA b 1.4 made to pfGAPDH, washed, further incubated with a horseradish peroxidase (HR antibody, developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Am ersham, Arlington Heights, IL), and then quantified by densitometry.

Discussion 151 DISCUSSION Chapter 7 CHAPTER 7. Discussion 152 7. Discussion 7. 1 Monoclonal antibodies: important tool in biomedic al research and applications Antibodies are host proteins that represent one of the principal effectors of the adaptive immune system. They are produced in response to mol ecules or organisms which they eliminate and/or neutralize. The ability of antibod ies to bind to the antigen with a high degree of affinity and specificity has led to their use in research, diagnostics and in the treatment of diverse diseases. Most antigens are highly complex, and present vario us epitopes recognized by a large number of lymphocyte receptors. Activate B lymphocy tes differentiate into antibody secreting plasma cell clones, and the resulting ant ibody response is usually polyclonal. In contrast, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are produced by a single B lymphocyte clone. These were first recognized in sera of patients wit h multiple myeloma in which clonal expansion of malignant plasma cells produced high l evels of an identical antibody resulting in a monoclonal gammopathy. In 1975, K\u00f6hler and Mil stein devised a technique for generating mAbs in vitro 1. The decision whether to use polyclonal antibodies o r mAbs as laboratory reagent depends on a number of factors, the most important of which is its intended use. Polyclonal antibodies can be generated much more rapidly at le ss expense and technical skill that is required to produce mAbs. However, with mAbs it is possible to target unknown molecules, undetectable with polyclonal antibodies. Moreover, mAbs are homogeneous and available in a limitless supply, and their mono specificity is useful in evaluating changes in molecular conformation, protein-protein interactions and phosporylation states, as well as in identifying single members of protein families. Also, mAbs are acquiring more and more importance as therapeutic agents. The re are more than twelve mAbs licensed for therapeutic use, including two that ar e labelled with radionuclides to deliver tumoricidal radiation (Ibritumomab-tiuxetan-90 Y, and Tositumomab-131 I, anti-lymphoma). The other commercial mAbs are used in the treatment of asthma, autoimmune diseases, cancer, respiratory syncytial virus, and preventing organ rejection 2. More than one hundred thousand scientific papers ar e available on mAbs, clearly showing that these antibodies (as a reagent) have contribut ed directly or indirectly to many CHAPTER 7. Discussion 153 scientific discoveries. In research, they are emplo yed for analysis, purification, enrichment, and to mediate or modulate physiological responses. Basic techniques such as and immunoprecipitation are examples in which mAbs are used to establish whethe r an antigen or related molecule is present in a biological samples (i.e., body fluid, cell suspension or tissue lysate) (Chapter 2-6). Combinations of these analytic techniques and mAbs has been successfully used in diagnosis of diseases such as hematological maligna ncies 3,4 , also in the monitoring of the disease 5, and the detection of many cancers 6. MAbs are also tools to identify and purify target antigens for serodiagnosis and vaccine candi dates 7-10 (Chapter 4). They have been used, at the same time, as fundamental tools for bo th functional (neutralize activity and activate signaling) and molecular biology studies o f target proteins. Within the framework of the present thesis, mAbs we re generated to study M. ulcerans and P. falciparum antigens, allowing the identification and characte rization of protein targets as candidates for serological tests, molecular fing erprinting and/or vaccine design. 7.2 Buruli ulcer In contrast with the existing knowledge on tubercul osis and leprosy, and despite that research on M. ulcerans has intensified in the last years, many aspects of Buruli ulcer are still incompletely understood. The identification a nd characterization of immunodominant antigens of M. ulcerans may contribute to our knowledge in its transmission , micro- epidemiology, and immune protection. 7.2.1. Immune protection and vaccine design It is thought that antibodies play no significant r ole in protection against intra-cellular mycobacterial infections such as tuberculosis and l eprosy. Therefore humoral responses have drawn little attention in the field of vaccine design against these diseases. Traditionally, most of our knowledge on antibody re sponses during mycobacterial infections has been derived from serodiagnostic stu dies. CHAPTER 7. Discussion 154 The advances in recombinant DNA technology have fac ilitated the identification of several major antigens of M. tuberculosis and M. leprae . Young et al. reported the first breakthrough in this field by using a lambda gt11 p hage expression system for efficient expression of mycobacterial DNA as fusion proteins in E. coli . They screened the mycobacterial libraries with antibody probes and su cceeded in identifying several recombinant mycobacterial antigens 11 . Testing these antigens with T-cell lines and clon es showed that human T-cell recognized most of them as well 9,12-20 . Several studies suggest that a number of these M. tuberculosis immunodominant antigens have potential as candidate antigens for a new vaccine against tuberc ulosis 21 . The most extensively studied antigens used in developing a new vaccine against t uberculosis recombinant live vacc ines and recombinant plasmids for DNA vaccines have all been tried out to protect against tuberculosis in experimental animals. Unlike other mycobacteria, M. ulcerans remains extracellular throughout the infection 24 and stimulates antibody responses 25-29 , therefore the potential of antibodies in controll ing the infection is higher. An important question abou t the pathogenesis of the disease concerns ulcer is ch aracterized by a down-regulation Th- 1 responses, potentially associated with the cytopa thic activity of mycolactone 26-28,30 . Spontaneous healing is frequently observed in late stages of M. ulcerans diseases. It is currently not clear, how the host eventually overco mes immune suppressed and develops a protective immune response? The explanation could b e that the mycobacterium is neutralized by an antibody response that develops s lowly over the course of the disease. However, antibody responses against mycolactone hav e not been observed in Buruli ulcer patients. Future studies in humoral response agains t recombinant immunodominant antigens identified in the present work may help to understand the role of antibodies in the control of the disease. Passive immune protection e xperiments in a mouse model with the mAbs generated in this thesis may help to give insi ght into the potential role of antibody responses against mycobacteria. If antibodies play a major role, it may in the end be easier to develop a vaccine against M. ulcerans disease than against leprosy or tuberculosis. CHAPTER 7. Discussion 155 7.2.2. Identification of polymorphic immunodominant protei ns and molecular fingerprinting of M. ulcerans isolates The antigenic overlap among mycobacterial species h as limited the studies of antibody responses against mycobacterial pathogens, of the i mmunopathogenesis of mycobacterial diseases, and the development of serological tests (diagnosis, mycobacteria exposure and evaluation of new vaccine). All humans are exposed to water- and air-borne environmental mycobacteria, which frequently come into contact wi th the skin and mucous membranes (digestive and respiratory epithelia). In addition, many children, particularly in developing countries, are inoculated with live BCG vaccine and frequently exposed to M. tuberculosis . Antigen overlap is also revealed for M. ulcerans , since most immunodominant antigens characterized in this thesis by mAbs contained epit opes present in many mycobacterial species (chapter 4), resulting in serological cross -reactivity. The use of these antigens in serological tests for M. ulcerans exposure of disease has limitations in endemic areas where BCG vaccination has been implemented and tube rculosis is also endemic. However, cross-reactive antigens could be used as p olymorphic genetic markers, and also as vaccine candidates. M. tuberculosis immunodominant antigens such as hsp65 showed more divergence between mycobacterial species than the 16S rRNA gene did 31 . Other polymorphic loci of M. tuberculosis included a phospholipase C, a membrane lipoprotein, members of an adenylate cyclase gene family, and members of the PE/PPE gene family, some of which have been implicated in virulence or the host immune response. Several gene families, including the PE/PPE gene family, also had significantly higher synonymo us and non-synonymous substitution frequencies compared to the genome as a whole. A number of these polymorphisms appear to have occurred multiple times as independe nt events, suggesting that these changes could be under select ive pressure 32 . The studies of M. ulcerans diversity performed with different typing technique s have all revealed a clonal population structure within speci fic geographical regions 33-38 and a low level of genetic variation, as also observed in M. tuberculosis . Nevertheless, sequence analysis of immunodominant antigens may reveal gene tic diversification. In this thesis, gene sequencing of only one immunodominant antigen (Laminin-Binding protein) allowed the description of eight different alleles, four of them were found in Australian isolates. CHAPTER 7. Discussion 156 7.2.3. Identification of target antigens for serolo gical analysis The clinical diagnosis of M. ulcerans can be confirmed by Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining, the culture of M. ulcerans , the detection of characteristic histopathological changes in excised tissue or the detection of M. ulcerans DNA by PCR. Since the vast majority of mycobacterial diseases (tuberculosis, leprosy and B uruli ulcer) occur in developing countries with limited resources, rapid and inexpen sive diagnostic tests would help limit the spread of the disease in the community. Assays based on the detection of immunological resp onses to M. ulcerans are attractive alternatives to current methods. In particular for pre-ulcerative disease where the collection of punch biopsies may enhance the spreading of the pathogen, a test requiring only a peripheral blood would be highly preferable. One of the aims of the present thesis was to identify M. ulcerans specific antigens as targets for a serodiagnostic m arkers or T-cell stimulation based assay. Unfortunately, the most im munodominant antigens characterized contained epitopes present in other mycobacteria. I n contrast, M. ulcerans 18 kDa shsp, which has no homologue in M. tuberculosis and M. bovis , turned out to be a suitable marker for exposure to M. ulcerans (chapter 3). The publication of the fully annotate d M. ulcerans genome will open new possibilities to identify spec ific immunodominant antigens for serodiagnostic tests or T-cell based tests diff erentiating the M. ulcerans exposure and disease. In the case of M. tuberculosis, the availability of the genome sequence has accele rated identification of antigens for serodiagnosis of tub erculosis, and a number of new antigens are being tested in various combinations to produce cocktails with high sensitivity and specificity. In tuberculosis, assays based on the s erological immunodominant antigen 38- kDa antigen 22 alone or in combination with other proteins have a chieved a high sensitivity (~80%) 39,40 . ESAT-6 and CFP10 are a lready used for diagnosis of active tuberculosis by the detection of interfer on (IFN)- production by ESAT-6/CFP10- specific CD4 T cells. Released IFN- can be measured by assessment of the supernatant o f the stimulated cells 41 or by using the enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) method 42 . CHAPTER 7. Discussion 157 The development of PCR-based assays to detect M. ulcerans has provided a tool to study its epidemiology and its mode of transmission 43 . Nevertheless, the epidemiology of M. ulcerans is only incompletely understood and the irregular d istribution of cases and considerable underreporting make it hard to draw an overall picture of the prevalence of Buruli ulcer disease. In tuberculosis, exposure has been measured through use of a delayed hypersensitivity (DTH) skin-test reaction using a p urified protein derivate (PPD). However, the highly cross-reactive nature of the PP D confounds the interpretation of skin- test positive for individuals who either have a his tory of vaccination with M. bovis BCG or who live in areas with a high environmental load of non-tuberculous bacteria 44 . A Buruli test is not suitable to measure exposure to M. ulcerans , because early Buruli ulcer patients are predominantly negative 45, and the first stage of the disease is characteriz ed by a down- regulation of Th-1 responses 26-28,30 . The detection of M. ulcerans exposure could be based on antibody responses, since household contacts and Buruli ulcer patients produce antibody responses against M. ulcerans antigens 26-28 . One of the main contributions of this thesis was the identification of a specific immunod ominant protein (18 kDa protein; chapter 3), which could be used as a serological ex posure target in Buruli ulcer endemic regions. Previous studies on tuberculosis suggest that for the development of a serological test, a cocktail of specific antigens is required t o increase the sensitivity of the test. Serological studies using multiple purified protein antigens have shown that the antibody response during tuberculosis is directed against ma ny mycobacterial antigens. Moreover, the antigen recognition is highly heterogeneous -no two single antigens or common set of antigens respond alike 46 . The identification and characterization of other M. ulcerans specific immunodominant antigens may help to increa se the sensitivity of the M. ulcerans exposure test further. 7.2.4. Antigen detection in environmental samples While it is clear from many epidemiological studies that the proximity to swamps and wetlands is a risk factor for M. ulcerans infection, the exact mode of transmission remains unknown 47 . Farming activities close to rivers in endemic are as, wading and swimming in rivers while not wearing protective clothing may re present risk factors 48,49 . The predominance of Buruli ulcer lesions on the extremi ties and, in males, on the trunk involves passive exposure of exposed body parts, su ch as by bites of insect vectors. Since CHAPTER 7. Discussion 158 M. ulcerans has been detected in the salivary glands of carnivo rous aquatic insects, it has been hypothesized that it may be transmitted by wat er bug bites 50-52 . M. ulcerans DNA has also been detected in aquatic organisms and biofilm s of aquatic plants 37,52-54 , but the contribution of these environmental elements in tra nsmission remains largely unknown. The discovery of IS2404 and IS2606 sequences in M. liflandii55 complicates the interpretation of past environmental studies. Immun oassays based on the sensitive detection of M. ulcerans specific antigens may in the future complement PCR -based analyses. In this thesis, it is shown that M. ulcerans antigens can be detected in Buruli ulcer lesions by western-blotting (chapters 2 and 3 ). Future studies using magnetic beads coated with mAbs against specific M. ulcerans immunodominant antigens may help to selectively recover and concentrate M. ulcerans from environmental samples to discover their ecological niche. CHAPTER 7. Discussion 159 7.3. Malaria Malaria, together with HIV and tuberculosis, is one of the major causes of disease in tropical countries. The accurate estimation of how many people die from malaria per year is difficult to achieve. Most estimates suggest tha t malaria directly causes about 300-660 million clinical cases and between one million deat hs per year 56 . Malaria has become a priority for the international health community and is now the focus of several new initiatives. The emergence and/or resurgence of mal aria in many parts of the world have resulted from the spread of the parasite's drug-res istant to various drugs, which has to rising malaria-associated mortality, especially in Africa 57 . An antimalarial vaccine has long been a public health priority but, despite ext ensive research, there is still no effective vaccine available 58 . Several studies have indicated that malaria vacci nes may be feasible. First, immunization with irradiated sporozoites pro tects or partially protects rodents 59 , monkeys 60 and humans 61,62 from being infected by sporozoites. Second, peopl e infected repeatedly by malaria develop \"natural acquired non -sterile immunity\"63 . Passive transfer experiments showed that immunoglobulins of such sem i-immune individuals can protect against clinical disease 64 . 7.3.1. Characterization of potentially novel vaccine candi date by mAbs Plasmodia are complex organisms. Each infection lau nches thousands of antigens against the human immune system, which differ with each sta ge of the parasite's life cycle. The main difficulty in finding a successful vaccine is i) due to the fact that P. falciparum can adapt to the human immune system and misdirect or s uppress it 65 , and ii ) our poor understanding of the natural immune response to mal aria. Conserved epitopes of the leading vaccine candidates are often not particular ly immunogenic 66 . While many other implicated epitopes are highly polymorphic (vary be tween strains) or change with time within strains 67 . Vaccine candidates targeting the erythrocytic stage s of the parasite have been the most intensively studied 68 . Antibody mediated neutralisation of the merozoite s, preventing their entry into erythrocytes 69 , or clearance of infected erythrocytes expressing merozoites surface antigens, represent potential mechanisms of immune protection 70 . Recent, access to CHAPTER 7. Discussion 160 the sequence of the entire genome of P. falciparum has provided opportunity to deduce the function of the predicted proteins through the iden tification of orthologue genes and motifs in other organisms 71 . The drive to identify novel vaccine candidates ha s in part focussed on identifying genes coding for transmembrane or secre ted proteins of P. falciparum 71,72 . Furthermore, these antigens should be accessible to the immune system, inducing protective immune responses in animal models. They should either lack antigenic diversity or have at least limited diversity, this allowing t o focus the immunoresponse on conserved functional domains 73 . Monoclonal antibodies represent an important tool to analyse new candidate vaccine antigens (localization, purificat ion, enrichment and functional activity). In the framework of these strategies for malaria su bunit vaccine design, using together computational models, expression tools and mAbs, th e characterization of a novel antigen designated D13 was accomplished. As shown by Weste rn blot analysis with anti-D13 mAbs (chapter 5), D13 is stage-specific, expressed during schizogony and is localized on one distinct pole of individual merozoites. The D13 N'-terminal region is a highly conserved gene product, which seems to have a funct ionally essential role in parasite biology, since anti-D13 mAbs have shown parasite gr owth inhibitory activity. In particular, the highly conserved N-terminal domain may represent a suitable target for malaria vaccine design. 7.3.2. Characterization of potentially drug target by mAbs Spreading of resistance to chloroquine in the early 1960's has had a dramatic impact on malaria treatment worldwide, making the development of new antimalarial drugs necessary. The identification and characterization of novel protein targets for drug development has been a very active area of research in the past 30 years that crosses many disciplinary boundaries such as biochemistry and mo lecular biology of malaria parasites, focusing on specific parasite molecules, which are key to the parasite's life-cycle or the induction of its pathogenesis. In the case of the a sexual blood stage, the parasite resides in erythrocytes: There are multiple membranes that mus t be traversed to access most intraparasitic targets, including the host cell-mem brane, the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane, the parasite plasma membrane, and in some cases, a further organelle membrane. Therefore, the parasite trafficking func tion and specificity offers huge CHAPTER 7. Discussion 161 potential for the future of parasite chemotherapy. In this thesis, using the anti-pfGAPDH mAbs by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopic analyses, we demonstrated that GAPDH is segregated in the late stages of parasite development from the cytosol, enriched in the apical region of merozoites. Furthermore, We stern blot analyses showed that pfGAPDH is in both the membrane-containing pellet a nd the supernatant fraction of parasite lysate. In addition, a quantitative micros omal recruitment assay confirmed that pfGAPDH and the thereof were rec ruited to HeLa cell-derived microsomes in a Rab2-dependent pfGAPDH exerts non-glycolytic function(s) in P. falciparum including vesicular transport and biogenesis of apical organelles (chap ter 6). The obligate dependence of P. falciparum on glycolysis for ATP production combined with the possible involvement of pfGAPDH in other biological functions makes it an a ttractive target for antimalarial drug development. This is supported by the development o f anti-trypanosomatid parasite drugs. The trypanosomatid glycolysis is compartmentalized, and many of its enzymes display unique structural and kinetic features. Structure- and catalytic mechanism-based approaches have been applied to design compounds wh ich inhibit the glycolytic enzymes like adenosine and GAPDH 74,75 . The limited amino acid sequence identity with hum an GAPDH, and the unicity of sequence features at the active site of pfGAPDH, suggests that potent and selective inhibitors could affect only t he growth of P. falciparum without affecting the corresponding proteins of the human h ost. Screening of a large library of compounds for pfGAPDH inhibitory activity in a high -through put screen has recently identified several structures with potential as lea d compounds for a drug development process (unpublished results). CHAPTER 7. Discussion 162 7.4. Concluding Remarks This PhD thesis identifies and characterizes immuno dominant antigens of M. ulcerans and characterizes of two P. falciparum proteins . These antigens were characterised by mAbs, which were generated from mice immunized with eithe r M. ulcerans antigens or P. falciparum recombinant proteins. We can conclude: 1. The study of M. ulcerans antigens contributed: i) to the development of a s erological test which may allow the assessment of exposure to M. ulcerans in endemic areas and ii) the identification of a polymorphic marker for strain t yping. 2. Characterisation of the D13 protein and GAPDH of P. falciparum revealed their potential as vaccine and drug targets, respectively . 3. Besides the availability of parasite genome sequ ences and the development of new bioinformatics models, mAbs will continue to provid e scientists with a powerful and important research tool. Working together, both tec hnologies could improve and speed-up the advance in the development of serological tests (diagnosis, exposure test) and/or the identification of a potential vaccine candidates an d potential drug targets, needed in developing countries.
