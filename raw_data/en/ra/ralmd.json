While deciding on my path there was a great debate whether to go the Naturopathic College or Homeopathic College. My own [ years of personal healing](https://alexgellman.com/?p=608) made that decision for me. I experienced both protocols growing up and decided to pursue a career as a Homeopathic practitioner. My principal reasons for embracing this path are simple: 1. Homeopathic medicine has the ability to deal with the skeletons in the closets, fears, obsessions and negative beliefs and thoughts that humans are plagued by. 2. This wondrous line of remedies has the ability to address the root cause of the problem and heal symptoms the individual is experiencing. 3. A well trained homeopath administering a remedy can expect a shift in the condition of the individual within a couple of hours or sometimes even less. Depending on the severity of the symptoms the condition can often take longer to respond. 4. Herbs, vitamins and other products of this type take days, weeks and often months for the individual to experience a shift in their condition. 5. Homeopathic medicines cost less than $10.00 each, so it can be accessible to all, even those with limited budgets. Most, physicians believe over 90% of all healing takes place \"between the ears\". Homeopathy helps with the necessary shift at that level. In a nutshell, that is why I believe homeopathy is one of the most effective and most reliable natural cures we have available to the human race. The Greek physician Hippocrates is the principal father of homeopathy. He introduced the principle that \"like cures like\". This concept means that a person suffering from violent vomitting, would be given a remedy that would produce that effect in a healthy person. The medical beliefs of the time embraced The Law of Contraries, which is the treatment of a condition with a substance that will create the opposite reaction. Homeopathy and the principles of healing of Hippocrates are also based onthe belief of the vital force, Chi or Tao in the Oriental systems or the Kundalini in the Tibetan/India yoga systems. What this means is - that within every living creature there is an energy force that drives it and keeps it alive. As we proceed through life that vital force is disturbed by traumas, disappointments, and unmet expectations. Think of an electrical cord and over the years a mouse has chewed little holes into the wires - after some time the light would no longer come on due to the electrical current being unable to flow through the slightly broken wires. The homeopathic remedy has the ability to go in and repair the many wires at many levels to bring the individual back to their original force they were born to embrace. The Father of Homeopathy who in 1790 documented the great works we use today is Samuel Christian Hahnemann. Hahnemann was a medical Doctor discouraged by the practices of the time so he began to explore new ways to treat patients. He discovered an article by Dr. William Cullen on the miracles of the Cinchona Peruvian bark, useful in treating malaria. He chose to experiment on himself and found to his astonishment that taking the Cinchona Peruvian bark in a diluted substance produced all the symptoms of malaria. He spent years testing his theories. The responses and reactions varied in individuals, but in everyone, the Cinchona Peruvian bark produced symptoms of malaria to different degrees. He continued this process of multiple dilutions, and discovered that themore diluted the product the less reactions his patients experienced. In addition he introduced a concept called \"succusion\". This process is achieved by vigorously shaking the remedy. There is research being done in the UK to support and show scientific evidence how the succusion process releases molecules of the original substance to increase the healing effect of the remedy. He believed that the homeopathic remedy has the ability to stimulate the vital force of the body and regain the body's' natural innate ability to heal itself. As the vital force becomes stronger, the body has the ability to fight illness and infection. Hahnemann devoted his life to the investigation and development of remedies. He discovered that the greater the dilution the more potent the remedy became. This is a brief overview of the dilution process and effect of the remedies: . Remedies that have an X after the number have been diluted in 10 ml of water . Remedies with a CH after the number have been diluted in a 100 ml of water . Remedies in number less than 29 have the ability to address the physical aspect of the condition . Remedies that have been diluted 30 times address the physical and emotional symptoms . For a physical ailment like a broken bone use a very low number like4 or 6 . Remedies diluted 200 times address the emotional and spiritual aspects of the person . Remedies diluted 1,000 times and higher address the spirits and the hereditary code we received from our ancestors, both physical and emotional predispositions After Hahnemann came Kent and Hering, who put together our Materia Medicas. This is an encyclopedia of every symptom a person could experience, and the remedies that will shift those conditions. Remedies are made from the minerals of the earth, animal and plant sources. How are Homeopathic Remedies Prescribed? A homeopath prescribes a remedy based on a thorough fact finding process. The patient tells their story from their conception to the present. After hearing the personal history, the homeopath will ask questions that will begin to create a picture of the individual, including: . Their personality e.g. extrovert or introvert. . Their fears. . Their goals, desires and wishes. . What makes them feel better/what makes them feel worse. . How they react to external stimuli like weather and stress. . Food preferences and dislikes and/or reactions. . Circadian rhythm - what is their best and worst time of day or night . Whether discomforts in the body focus on the right or left side, or travel from one side of the body to the other. . Individual sleep positions. . Temperature preferences. . Particular habits and/or idiosyncrasies. These are the external clothes of the body. The homeopath also delves into an individual's spirit realm with questions such as: . What do they dream about. . Childhood and present dreams. . Aspirations. . Emotions. . Phantasmal perceptions - like a feeling somebody is standing behind you, or the childs' fear that somebody is hiding under the bed. When all this information is compiled a remedy is identified that will support all the criteria, and also address the physical manifestations of the life force imbalance. To recap, if a person was totally healthy and they took a certain remedy, it would produce those mental, physical and emotional symptoms that the remedy would address in an unhealthy person. Healing is incredibly fast. Often patients leave the office and phone when they get home to report that their acid digestion or depression feels better. It will come back perhaps the next day, and we will need to administer the remedy again, but eventually the old symptoms will dwindle away. HOMEOPATHIC CASE HISTORY #1: Ryan Homeopathy is prescribed based on as individual's total life experiences. For example, Ryan (name changed) came to see me recently suffering from partial facial paralysis, excruciating hip and leg pains, colitis and depression. I used Iridology first to read Ryan's eye and get a clear picture of what was going on inside him physically, mentally and emotionally, without being clouded by anything I might hear from him later. I next took a comprehensive homeopathic history. I then put all the pieces together, much like solving a puzzle, to identify the precise homeopathic remedy Ryan needed. Ryan's eye structure revealed he was a Humanitarian (see [Emotional Iridology)](http://www.alexgellman.dreamhosters.com/doctor_of_homeopathy.html), a person who under stress can withdraw and keep his emotions and feelings locked inside. These stored negative feelings had been eating away at Ryan for over fifty years, and in his case that lead to bowel problems. Ryan's eye structure also revealed tremendous emotional pain after the loss of first his father and then his mother. Ryan confirmed this finding. Sometimes people can become so disconnected from their feelings that they might not themselves be able to articulate the feeling. That is when my eye reading can help me fully understand what is going on with a person. Ryan's father died seven years ago. His mother died two years before the paralysis on the left side of his face showed itself; and the left side of the body rules nurturing and other issues related to one's relationship and interaction with mother. The grief experienced after the loss of a loved one is a very deep pain that will often bring other uncomfortable feelings to the surface that may include anger, guilt, or any unresolved past emotional issue. The good news is that it is always possible to resolve these emotional issues at any time with the help of homeopathic remedies. I then took a comprehensive historical timeline of when each of Ryan's physical symptoms first appeared, and when key mental and emotional traumas in his life occurred. I treated Ryan with a specific customized homeopathic remedy that would help him change at a very deep emotional level and release layers of grief, guilt and anger. The outcome was a healthier bowel and the face paralysis was completely corrected. NOTE: Because everyone's life experiences differ, the specific homeopathic remedy will differ, even though people may share similar physical symptoms. For this reason I never disclose personalized remedies because they are arrived at only after a thorough personalized consultation. HOMEOPATHY AND EMERGENCIES Homeopathic remedies are wonderful to have in the medicine cabinet for emergencies. As already mentioned it is best to put yourself in the care of a qualified practitioner, however, the basic potencies noted here are safe for home use. A key remedy to have on hand is Arnica. This remedy is made from the leopard's bane plant. Legend has it that mountain climbers in Switzerland nibbled on the bark of leopard's bane to help ease aching muscles. This remedy can help heal all physical ailments after an accident such as: bone fracture, sprains, nosebleeds, eye injuries, and concussions. Arnica works best if administered as soon as possible after the injury occurs. Use a basic potency of Arnica 30 CH, and take 3 pills every two hours until the pain eases. Continue taking Arnica as needed every two hours, reducing it to 3-4 times a day, for up to seven days depending upon the severity of the symptoms. "}
