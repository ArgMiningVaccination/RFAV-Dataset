The use of these ravishing rocks to heal various ailments dates back to 30,000 years. \"Crystals are Mother Nature's bounty. They are formed when the lava, minerals and other elements inside the earth find their way to the crust during events such as tectonic movements, and crystallise while cooling down. What distinguishes crystals from other stones are that they can absorb, retain and emit energy. They can be used to heal physical ailments as well as emotional distresses caused by energy imbalances,\" says Dr Meeta Sharma, psychologist and proponent of alternative medicine. Healers use crystals either alone or in tandem with esoteric traditions such as Reiki, Chakra healing and even with the popular allopathic treatment. Based on empirical evidence, benefactors vouch for crystal cure. One may ask whether it is the placebo effect or the belief that heals. \"Whether you believe or not, the fact is a tree gives out oxygen. Similarly, crystals emit good energy, no matter what. Belief just makes you conscious of the changes they bring in,\" smiles Dr S0harma, adding, \"It takes dedication and belief to understand crystals.\" Over 500 types of crystals, each with distinctive properties, are used in healing. At times, one or more crystals are used in combination for curing an ailment. The Indian Chakra healing practice is based on the concept of the seven chakras or energy grids (psychic centres) around the physical body. Each chakra caters to certain organs or parts of organs. Healers align competent crystals with chakras associated with the respective body part to treat an ailment. For example, amethyst can be aligned with the crown chakra, which is located over the head, to cure stress, anxiety and insomnia. Alternatively, it can boost spiritual energy. \"Similarly, rose quartz is compatible with the heart chakra. Issues related to blood pressure and diabetes can be treated with this crystal. In psychology, it could be used to resolve relationship issues, bring in more love and compassion in life, and balance emotional energy,\" says Dr Sharma. Buddhists and Muslims were traditionally fond of turquoise, which aids expression. Since expression is associated with creativity, artists could benefit from it. Alternatively, it could be used to cure throat ailments. Carnelian is a crystal associated with Sacral Chakra, including the womb. Understandably, it can cure fertility and menstruation-related issues, and polycystic ovarian diseases. Selenite, named after the Greek moon goddess Selene, can absorb negative energy in a space. This can be aligned with any chakra for treatment. So, why alternative medicine? \"There are no side effects,\" says Dr Sharma. \"Crystals store energy, and are very powerful. We pop up pills even for a headache, but if it can be cured with Mother Earth's gift, why resort to something that could harm your body in the long run? Not all mental issues can be cured completely using Western medicine-based psychotherapy and cognitive behaviour therapy. When established treatments fail, what next?\" she asks. "}
