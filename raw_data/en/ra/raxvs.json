Often referred to as an epidemic in the U.S., obesity is known to worsen serious health issues like heart disease, cancer and diabetes. Ragui Sadek, MD, FACS, Director of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Hamilton and RWJUH in New Brunswick, explains how excess weight affects infection risks. Why is obesity connected with serious illness from infection? There's a significant link between fatty tissue and immune cells, with overweight people being prone to experience an increase in the body's inflammatory response. A certain amount of inflammation helps the body heal injuries and fight infections. But too much inflammation or inflammation that continues for extended periods can lead to numerous health problems\u2014and being overweight or obese is a hyperinflammatory state. Hormonal changes associated with obesity can affect important immune system components such as infection-fighting T cells. Deregulation of certain hormones due to obesity weakens the immune system and makes the body more susceptible to infection. Why are overweight people more likely to get seriously ill from a viral infection? When obese people experience a major respiratory infection, for example, they may lack cardiopulmonary strength in the heart and lungs to battle it. COVID-19 is a perfect example in that overweight people are not as able to fight it off as non-overweight people. But other types of infection pose greater risks to the overweight as well. For example, when overweight people have diabetes or prediabetes, any infection can be significantly worse. Bacterial skin infections in the extremities can occur from something as simple as a pinprick or scratch. How can a bariatrics program and weight loss surgery help? Losing weight improves overall health and helps the body fight infection. Bariatric surgery changes the digestive system in ways that foster weight loss and can lower blood sugar, improve or even cure diabetes, and boost cardiopulmonary function.

To connect with a top cardiovascular specialist at RWJBarnabas Health, call 888.724.7123 or visit www.rwjbh.org/heart.Coronary artery disease (CAD)\u2014 when major arteries to the heart are damaged and blood flow is partially or totally blocked\u2014is the most common type of heart disease in the U.S. However, new technology, along with a team-based approach to treatment, have greatly improved patient outcomes, says interventional cardiologist Bruce Haik, MD, Chief of the Division of Cardiology and Director of the Cardiac Catheterization Lab at Cooperman Barnabas Medical Center (CBMC), who is also a member of RWJBarnabas Health Medical Group. \"Treating CAD sometimes involves a complex decision tree requiring a Heart Team consultation,\" says Dr. Haik. \"When a patient and family have input from cardiac specialists with a wide array of expertise, they can feel confident in making a decision about treatment.\" MEMBERS OF THE TEAM CAD can be diagnosed in a variety of ways, including cardiac stress tests, which show how the heart works during physical activity; a coronary CT scan, a specialized, ultra-fast imaging test that can provide a calcium score and also provide noninvasive information about the arteries; and an angiogram, an X-ray that can accurately detect blockages. These tests are often ordered by a cardiologist , a doctor trained in finding, treating and preventing cardiac disease. The noninvasive cardiologist may refer the patient to an interventional cardiologist . \"This is a specialist in the nonsurgical opening of arteries,\" says Dr. Haik. A procedure done by an interventional cardiologist is angioplasty, also known as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In this procedure, a soft, flexible guide wire and various balloon catheters and devices are inserted into a narrowed blood vessel in order to open the artery with stents. The process is sometimes aided by imaging from within the blood vessel utilizing specialized imaging systems. The interventional cardiologist will consult with a cardiac surgeon , whose specialty is open heart surgery, in which an incision is made in the chest in order to perform coronary artery bypass graft surgery, sometimes combined with valve repair or replacement. Both of those doctors will rely on the information provided by a cardiac imaging specialist , who uses sophisticated technology to provide detailed images of a heart's chambers, valves, walls and blood vessels. \"It's important to know the severity, location and extent of the narrowing, but also to understand whether the blockage is rigid and calcified, or is more consistent with soft plaque,\" says Dr. Haik. MAKING THE CALL The Heart Team approaches each patient's individual treatment plan by considering many clinical factors, including age, frailty and coexisting medical conditions like diabetes in order to achieve the best possible outcomes. \"The cardiology field has evolved so that we now have many effective ways of treating CAD and related conditions,\" says Dr. Haik. \"For example, the Shockwave balloon utilizes ultrasound waves to break up calcified plaque before placing a stent, allowing for more complete expansion. \"All of these options are weighed along with the particular patient's risk profile,\" he explains. \"A major benefit of the Heart Team process is that sometimes a hybrid approach using both catheter-based procedures and surgery turns out to be the safest and most effective means of treatment.\" BRUCE HAIK, MD A TEAM APPROACH TO CORONARY ARTERY DISEASEHEALING HEARTS RWJBarnabas Health | RWJBH.ORG | 9 Healthy Together | PB Summer 2022 System_CardiacCAD_Sum22_Final.indd 9System_CardiacCAD_Sum22_Final.indd 9 6/1/22 6:59 AM6/1/22 6:59 AMOUR PATIENTS HAVE THE BENEFIT OF ADVANCED TREATMENT OPTIONS, CLINICAL TRIALS AND GREATER ACCESS TO EXPERT CARE. \"Over the years, there's been a revolution in the way we treat skin cancers, especially melanoma,\" says Sarah Weiss, MD, Director, Melanoma/Cutaneous Oncology Program at Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, the state's only NCI-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. \"The important thing to know is that with skin cancer, even if it's advanced, there are now a number of potentially effective therapies available.\" \"A diagnosis of skin cancer can be scary,\" says Adam Berger, MD, FACS, Chief, Melanoma and Soft Tissue Surgical Oncology at Rutgers Cancer Institute, \"but when you're treated by a multidisciplinary team, the chances of a good outcome are excellent.\"NEW WAYS TO TREAT SKIN CANCER ADAM BERGER, MD RWJBarnabas Health, together with Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey\u2014the state's only NCI-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center\u2014 provides close-to-home access to the latest treatment options.

SARAH WEISS, MD RWJBarnabas Health | RWJBH.ORG | 11 Healthy Together | 10 melanoma accounts for only 1 percent of skin cancers, it causes the majority of skin cancer deaths. \"Physicians at Rutgers Cancer Institute and RWJBarnabas Health treat all types of skin cancers, but we worry about melanoma because it has the highest chance of spreading in the body,\" says Dr. Weiss. \"The majority of patients we see will have surgery to remove the melanoma, and that will be the only treatment they'll need,\" explains Dr. Berger. However, if a lymph node biopsy reveals that the cancer has spread, systemic treatment may be given. This may include targeted therapy or immunotherapy. \"The FDA has approved many new therapies over the past 10 years, including several new ones just this year, that enable us to harness a patient's immune system to fight melanoma as well as other skin cancers,\" says Dr. Weiss. Patients may be eligible for one of a number of clinical trials available at Rutgers Cancer Institute or one of the RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH) hospitals. \"Our goal is to offer clinical trials in every setting of the disease, for patients who've never had treatment to patients who've had prior treatments but are in need of new therapies,\" says Dr. Weiss. MANY MINDS Multidisciplinary care means that patients at RWJBH hospitals and Rutgers Cancer Institute benefit from the expertise of a dedicated team of specialists, including surgical oncologists, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, radiologists, dermatologists, pathologists, nurses, nurse navigators and social workers. \"We meet on a weekly basis to discuss each patient's case,\" says Dr. Berger. \"We put our heads together to create a personalized plan of care for each individual.\" Physicians throughout Rutgers Cancer Institute and RWJBH coordinate care across the state at RWJBH hospitals. Their mission, says Dr. Berger, is to make top-level cutaneous oncology (skin cancer) care available for patients close to home. Franz O. Smith, MD, MAcM, MMM, FACS, Northern Lead, Melanoma and Soft Tissue Oncology Program, RWJBarnabas Health, and Medical Director, The Melanoma Center at Cooperman Barnabas Medical Center, collaborates with the cutaneous oncology team at Rutgers Cancer Institute, attends the weekly multidisciplinary tumor board meetings and offers patients access to clinical trials. He also sees patients at Clara Maass Medical Center in Belleville. The cutaneous oncology team at Rutgers Cancer Institute also works closely with surgical oncologist Victor Gall, MD, who treats melanoma and skin cancer patients at Community Medical Center in Toms River, Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch and Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus in Lakewood.

It's more likely than other skin cancers to spread to other parts of the body if not treated early. \"I advise patients to see a dermatologist for a skin check regularly, and if there's any change in a mole, to be seen right away,\" says Adam Berger, MD, FACS, Chief, Melanoma and Soft Tissue Surgical Oncology at Rutgers Cancer Institute. The most important warning sign of melanoma is a new spot on the skin or a spot that is changing in size, shape or color. Be on the lookout for spots that have any of the following features: A IS FOR ASYMMETRY: One half of a mole or birthmark does not match the other.A B IS FOR BORDER: The edges are irregular, ragged, notched or blurred.B C IS FOR COLOR: The color is not the same all over and may include different shades of brown or black, or sometimes patches of pink, red, white or blue.C D IS FOR DIAMETER: The spot is larger than 6 millimeters across (about \u00bc inch\u2014the size of a pencil eraser), although melanomas can sometimes be smaller than this.D E IS FOR EVOLVING: The mole is changing in size, shape or color.E Source: American Cancer Society\u00bc\" RWJBarnabas Health | RWJBH.ORG | 11 Healthy Together | 11System_Melanoma_Sum22_REV1.indd 11 6/1/22 2:14 CAN PLA Y RWJBarnabas Health | RWJBH.ORG | 13 Healthy Together | 12 FIELD OF DREAMS IS OPEN TO KIDS OF ALL ABILITIES. \"Gavin has no place to go. He used to have places to go, but a beer truck changed all that. And that can happen to you or someone you love in the blink of an eye.\" That's how Christian Kane explained the need for a recreational complex for people with disabilities to potential donors. In 2012, the car Christian was driving was hit by a truck, leaving his son, Gavin, just 19 months old, with a fractured skull and severe disabilities. Since then, Kane and his wife, Mary, who also have four other children, have spared no effort to help Gavin have as normal a childhood as possible. That's how they learned that even \"inclusive\" playgrounds\u2014\"with some rubber flooring and a big red swing chair\"\u2014can create an environment in which disabled children feel unwelcome. And that's why they decided it was necessary to build a comprehensive recreational facility where children of all abilities, and their caretakers, would feel at home. So Kane, a math teacher at Toms River North High School, became the chief organizer, fundraiser and salesperson for their dream. \"To sell teenagers on the idea that math is cool, you have to know how to sell,\" he says with a laugh. Five years and one month from the day the couple had the idea, the RWJBarnabas Health Field of Dreams opened in Toms River. It features a basketball court, baseball field, nine-hole miniature golf course and a playground area specially designed for wheelchairs and adaptive equipment. The complex has a \"quiet corner\" pavilion for children with autism, strategically placed outlets for recharging wheelchairs and more. There's nothing like it anywhere in the country. \"The Kanes' passion project aligned perfectly with RWJBarnabas Health's commitment to health equity and supporting community-based initiatives,\" says Barry Ostrowsky, Chief Executive Officer of RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH). OUTSIDE THE BOX The Kanes already had a connection with RWJBH through Children's Specialized Hospital in Toms River, an RWJBH facility, where Gavin has been receiving physical and occupational therapy since the accident. \"Mind you, most of the doctors we were seeing early on told us to put Gavin in a home because he would amount to nothing,\" says Kane. \"We said, we'll take him to our home, and we found help for Gavin at Children's Specialized. The physical and occupational therapists there have basically treated Gavin like their own child. They're always thinking outside the box, trying new things\u2014anything to help him get better.\" Gavin is now in fourth grade in the Toms River public school system. \"Through the use of a tablet, he's able to communicate and learn,\" says Kane. \"Through the use of my body and my wife's body, he's able to walk around. He's come a long way, but he's still not where we want him to be. That's our number one project.\" After that priority comes Field of Dreams, which now needs to be maintained and to grow. Adults with disabilities\u2014who often have limited options after they age out of support provided by the public school system\u2014will make up a large part of the staff. Sports leagues are being formed. Since the complex is a private entity and doesn't get state funding, fundraising will be a constant need. \"This project is immensely important to individuals with special healthcare needs,\" says Matthew McDonald III, MD, Chief Executive Officer of Children's Specialized Hospital. \"It gives folks an opportunity to socialize and exercise. We are so looking forward to packing this place.\" \"Gavin is extremely excited,\" says Kane. \"Now he can play with his friends and meet new people.\" .To learn more, visit www.rwjbhfieldofdreams.com.

People were staying in jobs longer, experts speculated, because of factors such as increased life expectancy, higher education levels and the rise in the minimum age to collect full Social Security benefits. In the past two years, that trend began to reverse: Beginning with the pandemic-related economic shutdown, a significant number of U.S. adults who hadn't necessarily planned to retire did so. It's estimated that two and a half million \"excess\" retirements took place between March 2020 and the second quarter of 2021. \"What we've been seeing is a wave of people who have rethought the contract between themselves and the world of work,\" says Frank A. Ghinassi, PhD, Senior Vice President of Behavioral Health and Addictions at RWJBarnabas Health and President and CEO of Rutgers University Behavioral Health Care. \"The question is whether they made the choice with a complete understanding of what the consequences would be.\" REASONS TO LEAVE Fear was a motivator for many, Dr. Ghinassi says. \"Early in the pandemic, before we had vaccinations and better medications, lots of people were dying,\" he says. \"People began to ask themselves, is going into work worth my personal risk? You saw this in people who couldn't work from home, such as environmental services workers, first responders and healthcare workers. \"Also, many individuals began to experience symptoms of anxiety and depression. Surveys indicate that's been true for an increasing number of people in the past two years. \"Then, as the pandemic ground on, making decisions about vaccination and risks and new variants have all begun to weigh on people,\" Dr. Ghinassi explains. \"Older adults started thinking about how they wanted to spend the rest of their lives. A lot of employees began to examine whether they could make retirement work earlier than previously planned.\" For a fortunate subset of people, personal wealth grew during this time period due to a heated housing market and booming stock market. With more money came more options. AND THEN WHAT? \"Some people have a good plan for retirement and have really thought out the budget and what they'll do,\" says Dr. Ghinassi. \"But often, people have a fantasy of retirement life that's based on their vacations: You don't have the stress of work, you go somewhere nice and spend more money than you usually do. The reality of retirement is that you have to create a lifestyle that can fit your budget, 52 weeks a year for the next 25 to 30 years.\" Retirees also need to be prepared to find new ways of being with their families, he says. \"Americans tend to be very hardworking. That means you were away from your family 45, 55, sometimes more hours a week,\" he says. \"When you retire, your family members are going to see you infinitely more than they have before and that's a big change, even in happy, well-adjusted families,\" he says. \"Now you have to find structured ways not only to be together, but to be apart. People deal with issues like, how do you get your alone time when your spouse is always around?\" Selling a house and downsizing to a smaller space can present challenges as well. \"You're not only spending way more time together, but now you're doing it in a smaller space,\" Dr. Ghinassi says. \"That's not necessarily good or bad, but it does require renegotiation. Ideally, retirement is based on a realistic plan.\" If it turns out that full-time retirement doesn't suit, the current shortage of employees in the U.S. offers opportunities to return to the workforce. \"Some people,\" says Dr. Ghinassi, \"decide to rejoin the workforce in a totally different profession and become reinvigorated about work.\" To learn about mental health services at RWJBarnabas Health, call the Behavioral Health Access Center, which is open 24 hours a day, at 800.300.0628.FRANK A. GHINASSI, PHD 8 QUESTIONS TO ASK \"It's important to walk through the actual realities of retirement as thoroughly as you can before you take that step,\" says behavioral health specialist Frank A. Ghinassi, PhD. How are you going to cover medical costs? What is your debt situation? How much of your nest egg is tied to the stock market? Finances can be a source of significant stress. Are your friends retired and if not, how will that affect your social life? How will you structure a typical day, from the time you get up until the time you go to bed? What will a typical week look like? A month? What are your hobbies, and how will they help provide structure for your time? Have you talked to people you know well and asked them what retirement has meant for them? If you've decided to move away from where you've lived, how will you make new friends? If your partner is also retired or not working, how will you negotiate daily life now that you're together for a greater part of the day? RWJBarnabas Health | RWJBH.ORG | 15 Healthy Together | Hospital, we provide world-class care for children and young adults who face special health challenges across the state of New Jersey and beyond. We treat everything from chronic illnesses and complex physical disabilities, like brain and spinal cord injuries, to a full scope of developmental, behavioral and mental health concerns. We have convenient locations throughout the state: Bayonne, Clifton, East Brunswick, Egg Harbor Township, Hamilton, Jersey City, Monmouth, New Brunswick, Newark, Somerset, Toms River, Union and West Orange.When lockdowns created by the pandemic began, the staff at Opportunity Project, a program for adults with brain injury, knew they had to pivot quickly. Members of the Opportunity Project Clubhouse were relying on them as they worked to rebuild their life skills\u2014and they were used to meeting in person at the Millburn-based facility. \"People were in a panic,\" says Jacqueline Marino Rizzi, Cognitive and Community Integration Skills Counselor. \"We had to think fast. Right away, we created a Facebook private group for members. But we knew our members varied greatly in technology know-how and access.\" The staff learned how to create meetings that members could join by either video or phone. They helped those without an internet connection get one. Members left their iPads out on their porches so a staffer could download the apps needed for virtual meetings. Soon, just about everyone had the appropriate technology to participate in video calls. \"Then we made sure to keep our programs very consistent, because our members are routine-oriented,\" Marino Rizzi says. \"We held the groups at the same times and we provided reminders to make sure people would stay engaged.\" A NEW MODEL Now there's a range of new services, including Mental Health Mondays, Grief Counseling Tuesdays, Wellness Wednesdays, Team-Building Fridays and an Adjustment Counseling Group on Saturdays. There's virtual cognitive retraining, adaptive chair yoga, music therapy, team building, stress relief and more. The OP Resilience Squad, where members provide peer-to-peer support, was launched, as was the OP Caregiver Support Group.Similarly, Melissa Moyer, Nutrition Counselor, adapted her wellness groups to the virtual world. Fitness classes became videos that groups watched together, following along at home. Opportunity Project teamed with the SPIRIT Club to connect with its online database of inclusive fitness classes. Healthy cooking classes were livestreamed from the Clubhouse. In individual and group sessions, members discussed ways to overcome limitations related to their brain injury that hinder them from meeting their health and wellness goals. Now, as COVID-19 health protocols permit, the Opportunity Project Clubhouse has transitioned to a hybrid model, with limited in-person activities. Counselors say, however, that a virtual component is here to stay. \"Sometimes members had transportation barriers to coming to our in-person programs,\" Moyer says. \"Others struggled with the amount of preparation it takes to get out of the house. The fact that they can participate from their living rooms has been a great thing for them.\" \"We've evolved and been able to keep providing positive support,\" says Marino Rizzi. \"Our members are continuing to make progress!\" Children's Specialized Hospital partners with Opportunity Project to ensure that children in its brain injury programs can continue to have the support they need throughout adulthood.

THE VIRTUAL CLUBHOUSE Healthy Together | 16 | University Hospital (RWJUH) Hamilton is helping to safely and comfortably transport qualifying patients to their medical appointments free of charge thanks to funding from the RWJUH Hamilton Foundation Patient Assistance Fund. The program, in partnership with the community-based, nonprofit transportation service Greater Mercer RideProvide, offers door-to-door transportation in private vehicles with professional drivers Monday through Friday between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. \"I've been using the transportation program for about a year,\" says Trudy Mohrman, an 85-year-old RWJUH Hamilton patient. \"It's been very helpful since I need to go to rehab twice a week after I fell and broke my leg. I can't drive due to my injury, and I don't have family in the area to drive me to my appointments. The program has allowed me the independence to get to my appointments and back home until I can start driving again.\" RWJUH Hamilton patients can sign up to use the RideProvide service for RWJUH Hamilton medical appointments at no cost if they are seniors 65 and over or visually impaired adults. \"The program not only offers a safe and convenient service to area residents in need, but also ensures vulnerable members of the community have access to vital medical care while allowing them to maintain their mobility and independence and reducing their risk of isolation,\" says Diane Grillo, Vice President, Health Promotion, RWJUH Hamilton. \"In 2021, we provided transportation to over 900 medical visits for seniors and visually impaired patients and are looking forward to growing that number in the years to come.\" REMOVING CARE BARRIERS RideProvide is just one way in which the Patient Assistance Fund supports patients. The fund also helps those in need cover costs for appointments, medications, therapies and equipment. Staples such as gas and groceries are often covered as well. \"Many times, there are financial constraints and barriers that prevent patients from accessing treatments,\" says Jason Collier, Manager, Case Management, RWJUH Hamilton. \"The foundation's financial assistance creates a pathway for our patients to overcome these obstacles and provides access so they can transition to the next level of care and progress in their recovery.\" Each year, RWJUH Hamilton has supported over 100 patients to ensure discharge and continued care at home. \"It's a real positive experience to tell a patient who is struggling to pay for their medications that they no longer need to worry about the cost and can now focus on getting well because the Foundation has provided payment for the treatments,\" Collier says. \"The relief on their faces is worth a thousand words.\" MEDICAL ADVISORY PANEL MEMBERS The following physicians and experts provide guidance and expertise in developing our community health education programs.

The two women met in the Cancer Center lobby in November 2021 as Longo waited for a ride and Martin grappled with a mannequin. They struck up a conversation. Then Longo learned in a subsequent meeting that Martin once owned a clothing store called Flutter Boutique. Both women, it turned out, had an affinity for butterflies. \"I see butterflies as a metaphor for a woman,\" Martin says. They bonded over the notion that, like a woman, a butterfly can seem delicate yet is able to break out of its cocoon and take flight. \"Like the butterfly, women are much stronger than we're given credit for,\" Martin says. \"I couldn't help but think that she might see herself in that metaphor as she battles her disease.\" FINDING WHAT SOOTHES \"Holistic therapies empower individuals to improve health by tapping their inner healing abilities through things like relationships, art, music, environmental interaction and nature,\" says Diane Grillo, Vice President, Health Promotion, RWJUH Hamilton. \"The Holistic Program teaches you to know yourself in ways you might not have known before and find what soothes and heals.\" Ahead of its time when it started 20 years ago, the program engages patients not only through activities and services but also through facilities. A fireplace greets Can a chance encounter that leads to friendship help someone battle cancer? Lucinda Longo and Linda Martin bet yes. Longo, a Hamilton resident, was diagnosed with bladder cancer in April 2021 and chose treatment at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Hamilton. She knew the hospital's Cancer Center provided advanced treatment options close to home. The Cancer Center also features a Holistic Program that focuses on healing the whole person by addressing a range of physical, emotional, mental, social, spiritual and environmental influences on health.

After bonding over butterflies, Longo gave Martin a butterfly pin to thank her for her kindness and volunteer work. \"I was touched by her gift,\" Martin says. The friends offer each other support and a sense of community. For Longo, whose family lives in the Midwest, this has meant added local support during a challenging time. For Martin, Longo's positive attitude has provided perspective on difficulties like the pandemic. The two try to talk at least once a week and often get together for lunch. \"I have her butterfly pin on the table next to my bed as a constant reminder to stop dwelling on what is wrong in the world and let in the light,\" Martin says. \"And as I learned recently, the name Lucinda means 'light.'\" To learn more about the Holistic Program at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton's Cancer Center, call 609.584.2827. HEALING THE WHOLE PERSON The Holistic Program at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton's Cancer Center offers features and programs such as these at no cost to patients and families. Grounds for Healing\u00ae: A private garden in the Cancer Center provides natural landscaping including water features and a wisteria-covered trellis, along with sculptures to create a calming outdoor space. Reiki and massage: Reiki, a whole-body energy healing experience, and massage both can be beneficial to health and well-being. Sessions with licensed professionals are offered in various settings, including infusion rooms. Pet therapy: Visits with certified pet therapy animals can provide comfort and help patients and loved ones cope with cancer and other conditions. Aromatherapy and gazing therapy: Taking in scents or visually focusing on an object or image can be soothing or meditative. Yoga and meditation: Both help clear the mind and induce relaxation. Chair yoga and meditation sessions allow patients going through treatment to participate while seated. Spiritual care: A chaplaincy team is available to provide emotional support and assist patients and loved ones grappling with spiritual questions and thoughts that illness can raise regardless of faith, tradition or culture. Boutique services: Collaborations with local aestheticians and salon professionals allow patients to receive hair, wig and makeup services tailored to the unique needs of people undergoing cancer treatment. Music and singing: Live performances, recordings and, in some cases, lessons allow patients to experience calming sounds from instruments such as cello, violin, ukulele, flute, piano and bedside harp.

This minimally invasive procedure, which is usually performed in a cardiac catheterization lab, allows treatment of heart attack and chest pain syndromes. The state of New Jersey recently certified Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Hamilton to perform nonemergency, elective angioplasty in addition to emergency angioplasty. Mahmoud Ghusson, MD, a cardiologist at RWJUH Hamilton, explains how a basic balloon angioplasty with stent procedure works: MAHMOUD GHUSSON, MD A catheter (a small plastic tube) is inserted through the wrist or groin and threaded through an artery toward the heart. Contrast dye is injected so the doctor can see any blockage or plaque buildup. The stent may be coated in a medication that helps prevent scarring and reocclusion.Some patients stay in the hospital overnight after the procedure; others go home the same day. Moderate-intensity activities can be resumed in a week. The blockage is crossed with a very thin wire that will serve as a rail to deliver the balloons and stents. A collapsed balloon holding a stent (a tiny metal mesh tube) is advanced and positioned to cover the blockage. The balloon is then inflated, embedding the stent in the vessel wall and collapsing the blockage. The balloon is deflated and removed, leaving the stent fully deployed and working like a scaffold to keep the vessel from reoccluding (becoming obstructed). CATHETERPLAQUE CONTRAST DYE Arteries begin with the aorta, the main artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body.HEARTAORTA Healthy Together | 20 | Summer 2022 Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton | RWJBH.ORG/HAMILTON RWJUHH_Angioplasty_Sum22_Final.indd 20RWJUHH_Angioplasty_Sum22_Final.indd 20 HEART Angioplasty can be lifesaving, but healthy practices that keep your heart healthy can help you avoid treatment in the first place or maintain treatment benefits after a procedure. Key steps include: KNOW THE WARNING SIGNS OF A HEART ATTACK Every 40 seconds, someone in the U.S. has a heart attack. Know what to watch for\u2014and realize that warning signs may be different for a woman than for a man. It's common for women to experience more subtle angina (chest pain), as well as shortness of breath and upper back pain prior to having a heart attack. Call 911 as soon as you think you or someone you're with may be having a heart attack. Whoever your heart beats for, our hearts beat for you.

MAKE SMART LIFESTYLE CHOICES GET PHYSICAL: Aim to exercise each week for at least 150 minutes at moderate intensity or 75 minutes at vigorous intensity (or a combination). EAT HEALTHY FOODS: Get a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy, poultry, fish and nuts. Eat small portions and try to avoid red and processed meats, sugar, salt and saturated fat. QUIT SMOKING TRACK RISKS: Schedule regular checkups with your doctor to keep tabs on factors like weight, blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol, calcium score and sleep quality.Chest pain, but not always Jaw, neck or upper back pain Nausea or vomiting Shortness of breath Pain or pressure in the lower chest or upper abdomen Fainting Indigestion TYPICAL WARNING SIGNS IN WOMEN Squeezing chest pressure or pain Jaw, neck or back pain Nausea or vomiting Shortness of breath IndigestionTYPICAL WARNING SIGNS IN MEN Healthy Together | 20 | Summer 2022 Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton | RWJBH.ORG/HAMILTON RWJUHH_Angioplasty_Sum22_Final.indd 21RWJUHH_Angioplasty_Sum22_Final.indd 21 5/31/22 OF A 'VERY BIG' SPINE SURGERY CHOOSES CARE CLOSE TO HOME. Marcia says. \"I thought something was definitely wrong, and it was more than what anybody had been saying.\" She decided to go to a hospital for a comprehensive workup. Familiar with healthcare throughout the region, she opted to seek treatment at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Hamilton. \"I did part of my nursing training there in 2013,\" Marcia says. \"I knew RWJUH Hamilton was one of the best hospitals in New Jersey.\"A DIFFICULT DIAGNOSIS Team members at the Center for Neurosciences and The Orthopedic and Spine Institute at RWJUH Hamilton quickly diagnosed Marcia's true problem. The news wasn't good: Marcia had a cancerous tumor toward the base of her neck's cervical spine, at vertebrae C5 and C6. \"It was traumatic,\" Marcia says. She had a history of breast cancer, including a double mastectomy to remove her breasts in 2014. \"I had thought that was the end of Marcia* of Burlington didn't know what to make of the pain she felt in her neck. It started mild but gradually got worse. Was it an injury from lifting? As a 61-year-old neurology nurse working in New York City, Marcia often needed to assist patients on the job. Doctors she consulted offered different opinions. One thought she had a pinched nerve, another arthritis. \"Then one day around the holidays in 2021, the pain got really bad,\" 'SHE TRUSTED OUR NEUROSCIENCE PROGRAM'Neurosurgeons Kenneth Liebman, MD (left), and Zakaria Hakma, MD (right), are part of a collaborative neuroscience team. Healthy Together | 22 | Summer 2022 Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton | RWJBH.ORG/HAMILTON RWJUHH_NeuroPatient_Sum22_Final.indd she says. \"I knew it was possible for cancer to come back, but I didn't expect it.\" She consulted Zakaria Hakma, MD, Director of Neurosciences and Chief of Neurosurgery at RWJUH Hamilton, and a member of Global Neurosciences Institute, about what to do next. \"We went over details of my extensive workup,\" Marcia says. The two brought Marcia's sister into the conversation by phone for another perspective. \"We decided I definitely had to do surgery,\" Marcia says. \"I felt safe with Dr. Hakma.\" \"It speaks volumes that she's a neurology nurse and, when diagnosed with a serious problem, had informed confidence in the expertise and capabilities available at RWJUH Hamilton,\" Dr. Hakma says. \"She trusted our neuroscience program with a complex surgical procedure and didn't feel the need to travel anywhere else.\" REMOVING CANCER In January, Dr. Hakma performed what Marcia calls \"a very big surgery.\" It involved both a corpectomy, in which the diseased vertebrae were removed, and spinal fusion, in which remaining vertebrae were stabilized and joined with help from a cage-like implant. The surgery was successful, and after six days in the hospital, Marcia went home wearing a neck brace that facilitated healing. Outpatient physical therapy in the weeks that followed helped her recover and improve functions such as walking. She continued being treated for cancer with both radiation and ongoing chemotherapy. Marcia says her care was everything she had hoped for. \"My incisions healed well, with no signs of drainage or infection,\" she says with trained perspective. \"I'm walking, and my gait is steady. I felt my care was great.\" * Marcia chose to use only her first name for this article.

COMPREHENSIVE, CONVENIENT CARE FOR NEUROLOGICAL ISSUES \"Neuroscience services at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Hamilton have the clinical expertise and tools to provide advanced care close to home,\" says Zakaria Hakma, MD, Director of Neurosciences and Chief of Neurosurgery. Enhancing the hospital's neurosciences care are: Sophisticated technology: Tools include GPS-like intraoperative navigation that maps the brain and helps guide procedures more precisely; single-plane angiography that helps image arteries during procedures to restore blood flow to the brain; a state-of-the-art microscope that allows surgeons to perform more delicate operations; and a wide range of other advanced imaging technologies. Highly specialized doctors: \"Our comprehensive services cover virtually every neurologic specialty,\" Dr. Hakma says. These include general, spinal and cranial surgery along with subspecialties like functional neurosurgery to treat disorders such as Parkinson's disease; neuropsychology to care for cognitive problems such as dementia or deficits after stroke; cognitive neurology treating Alzheimer's disease and dementia; and neuromuscular neurology. A diverse, expert team: \"In addition to a deep roster of doctors, we have specialized staff such as physician assistants trained in neuroscience along with neuropharmacists who are tremendously helpful for complex patients who can sometimes take more than a dozen medications,\" Dr. Hakma says. Advanced rehabilitation: Rehab services are integral to comprehensive neurosciences care provided in a single location at Pennington. \"This is the greatest concentration of neurology services in the area,\" Dr. Hakma says. \"Having services in one place is more convenient for patients, and they feel at ease when doctors can walk over and personally introduce them to physical and occupational therapists.\" Collaborative care: \"We don't work in silos but work hand in hand across subspecialties,\" Dr. Hakma says. \"It's rare to see that kind of collaboration, but it improves care and makes things easier for patients.\" \"We have a truly patient-centered approach to groundbreaking therapies and new surgical techniques,\" says Richard Freeman, President and Chief Executive Officer, RWJUH Hamilton. \"Our innovative team of neurosurgeons, specialty neurologists and neurologic researchers, coupled with specially trained nurses, therapists and other allied health professionals, work together to provide a world-class, integrative, multidisciplinary approach to complete patient care.\" RWJBarnabas Health and Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton, in partnership with Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey\u2014the state's only NCI-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center\u2014provide close-to-home access to the most advanced treatment options.
