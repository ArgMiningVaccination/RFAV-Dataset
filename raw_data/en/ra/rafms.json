Foreword SocietyThe future has begun. The world around us is changing and the pace of change is faster than ever before. The future has begun and those who don't want to get left behind must ensure their ability to look ahead. That is why ISO has developed a Standardization Foresight Framework; to help us look more systematically at the long-term and to encourage discussion and exchange within the ISO system about future opportunities for International Standardization. This trend report is the output of the first phase of the Standardization Foresight Framework: environmental scanning . It is designed to support the ISO community to navigate global trends as we work towards achieving the goals and priorities of the ISO Strategy 2030 . In this report, we expand upon the drivers of change identified in the Strategy, breaking them down into smaller trends and analyzing their links to existing ISO work. Our ultimate aim is to better understand the context in which we operate, so that ISO can effectively meet emerging-market needs and help to shape a more sustainable future.ISO Standardization Foresight Framework | Trend Report 2022 In this report, we expand upon the drivers of change identified in the Strategy, breaking them down into smaller trends and analyzing their links to existing ISO work. ForewordTechnology Environment Economy Politics Science Where to from here? Foreword SocietyMany of the future trends in this report will be familiar. Readers will recognize, for example, the climate emergency, accelerating and converging technologies, shifting geopolitical and economic power, changing demographics and evolving consumer preferences. Although the content may not come as a surprise, we hope that pulling together this information will provide readers with a new, macro perspective on the world around us and standardization's place in it. This broad perspective should help to inform strategy and decision-making. The selected trends and STEEPS classification This trend report does not claim to be all-encompassing - the trends presented here are high-level and have been selected because of their relevance to standardization or to the international landscape within which ISO operates. They are long-term driving forces that are already having a visible impact at the global level. Specific events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or the conflict in Ukraine, are generally not mentioned at this level, although an understanding of the trends presented here can help us to better grasp the context of these events and think more broadly about their potential long- term consequences. Taking inspiration from the STEEPS analysis , which is a tool used in strategy to evaluate the external factors impacting an organization (also known as PEST or PESTLE analysis), we have chosen to classify our selected trends using the STEEPS categories of: SOCIETY , TECHNOLOGY , ENVIRONMENT , ECONOMY , POLITICS and SCIENCE .Convergence Above all, what emerges clearly from the trend descriptions in this report is the high degree of convergence and interlinkages between trends. Societal trends are inextricably linked to technological advances, which are themselves affected by economic and political trends, and so on. Many future challenges will arise at the intersections of these trends, as domains that were once distinct from one another - such as biology and information technology - become increasingly intertwined. What could this mean for standardization? ForewordTechnology Environment Economy Politics Science Where to from here? Foreword SocietyHow to explore this trend report Within the high-level STEEPS categories, trends have been grouped into 15 sub-categories. The trends can be browsed in any order, according to interest. Every trend includes an overall description, a list of ISO committees and key standards related to the trend (if any), and links to other ISO resources such as news stories or publications. For a more interactive experience and easier access to links to committees and resources, we invite you to consult the Web version of the report: https://www.iso.org/foresight.html .

Foreword SocietyResearch and methodology The contents of this report are the result of an environmental scanning process implemented by the ISO Central Secretariat (ISO/CS) Research and Innovation Unit (R&I).1 In order to identify the list of trends relevant for standardization, the R&I team selected and reviewed publicly available trend reports from a wide variety of organizations (including governments, international organizations, think tanks, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), research institutes and consulting firms).2 To be selected for review, the trend reports had to meet a series of criteria: less than five years old, published by a reputable source (no ideological bias and no profit motive), include references and a clear methodology for identifying and investigating trends, and be regional or global in focus. The trends chosen for inclusion in this report were those that featured most frequently across these publications and/or those that had a strong link to standardization, as revealed by mapping the trends to ISO's current and planned technical activities. 1. The methodology was developed as part of the elaboration of the ISO Standardization Foresight Framework, in collaboration with foresight experts from Future Impacts, https://future-impacts.de 2.

ForewordSociety Age groups Consumption Movement of people Prosperity Tech risks The changing nature of workSocietyTechnology Environment Economy Politics Science Where to from here? Society Foreword Age groups Ageing population | Young generation influences These trends are about demographic changes at both ends of the spectrum. Overall, the world's population is growing older, but there are nevertheless some regions where growing young populations will have significant impacts. While ageing populations will have implications for the sustainability of public financing models and healthcare, growing young populations will have implications for political behaviours and education systems. Both trends will profoundly affect workforce and employment models. Ageing population Populations are ageing in most countries in the world.3 Population ageing describes an increase in the size of a country's population over a certain age. Generally, the cut-off for analyzing growth in the 'old age' group is 65 years. That is, people considered to be of 'old age' are aged 65 and over. For years now, increases in the proportion of populations aged 65 and over have occurred in most countries. Population ageing occurs as a result of multiple factors: Increase in average life expectancy: Average life expectancy is generally calculated as 'life expectancy at birth'. Life expectancy can be increased by decreasing child mortality; improvements in overall population health; the elimination of diseases that contribute to premature deaths; and increased access to healthcare and other factors. In many countries, life expectancy has increased with economic development.4 3. Future Outlook. 100 Global Trends for 2050 (UAE Ministry of Cabinet Affairs and the Future, 2017) 4.

Society Foreword In developed regions, life expectancies are increasing by about two months per year. This adds about five years to the average person's lifespan per generation (all other factors being equal).5 By 2040, average life expectancy will be above 80 in 59 countries6; in 2050, the global average life expectancy will be 76.7 Low fertility rates: If people do not have enough children to 'replace' the population, older age groups can start to outnumber younger age groups. Reduced migration: Migration generally brings young, working- age people into a population. If migration is reduced, the proportion of the population in those age groups may grow less. Although every country will experience an increase in its average age over the next few decades, the balance of forces driving this trend will differ from country to country. 5.

Paradox of progress (US National Intelligence Council, 2017)While population ageing started in high-income countries (for example in Japan 30% of the population is already over 60 years old), it is now low- and middle-income countries that are experiencing the greatest change. By 2050, two-thirds of the world's population over 60 years will live in low- and middle-income countries.8 In developing countries, populations can 'age before they grow rich'9,10, leading to challenging strains on public resources. The number of people reaching working age during the coming decades will be significantly lower than in the preceding decades.11 The size of the working age population relative to the population of retirees is called the 'dependency ratio'. It is likely that by 2050, the dependency ratio will be below 2:1 in 35 countries around the world. Conversely, the dependency ratio is expected to improve in many African countries and parts of Asia.SocietyTechnology Environment Economy Politics Science Where to from here? Society Foreword Migration can be an important contributor to increasing the dependency ratio in an otherwise ageing population.12 In many countries, migration is already an important factor in maintaining a working population that can meet the needs of the ageing population.13 Immigration policies, particularly in developed countries, will need to balance a growing demand for workers with internal political tensions in the future.14 While some older people will require care and support, older populations in general are very diverse and make multiple contributions to families, communities, and society more broadly. Yet the extent of these opportunities and contributions depends heavily on one factor: health. Supportive physical and social environments enable people to do what is important to them, despite losses in capacity. 12. Global trends.

These may include mobility, safety, and medical products, but also increased tourism, leisure, and spending.20 Opportunities are expected in the SocietyTechnology Environment Economy Politics Science Where to from here?

Younger population groups will have an influence on workforces, the economy and demand for products and services. Young populations are of particular importance in sub-Saharan Africa, where half of the citizens will still be under 21 years of age by 2035.24 Young people from all economic and cultural backgrounds are increasingly interacting in online spaces. They are both influencing and being influenced by a global spectrum of ideas, trends, opinions, and advertising.25 These younger generations will pose challenges to governments, in their increasing political engagement, and to businesses, as their over- exposure to advertising leads to more sophisticated purchasing decisions. Many people see younger generations as having strong opinions around climate change, political issues, and social injustices.26 The influence of educated and tech-savvy young people in the world of work will require responsive talent management and creative thinking about staff development and career opportunities.27 The employment opportunities of today's youth have been affected by successive financial crises. 24.

Society Foreword Consumption The experience economy | Sustainable production | Customized products Consumer attitudes and preferences are constantly changing as a result of megatrends, such as increasing ' Connectivity', ' Environmental degradation', demographic changes, shifting inequalities, and more. The trends described below are some of the more long-term driving forces that are affecting how companies think about value creation today - it is no longer just about the final product, but about the inputs that went into it along the whole value chain, how that product is produced, and how unique it is (tailored to a specific customer's needs). Indeed, it may no longer be about a product at all, as consumers move away from wanting 'things' to wanting experiences that bring them personal growth and more than material satisfaction. Given that consumer spending drives such a large part of the global economy, these consumption related trends have wide-ranging impacts and will affect many of the other trends featured in this report. The experience economy The growth of the experience economy reflects people's increasing desire to 'experience' rather than 'consume'; to 'do' rather than to 'have'. It is about generating memorable events that are personal and unique and have an important emotional impact. The experience economy is especially evident in the travel and tourism sector, where \" Travelers today are increasingly drawn to travel as a form of self-actualization and personal transformation and growth. They want more than a simple visit to a new destination or days spent relaxing on a beach. Instead, the travel they are seeking is an experience of the world that goes deep one that changes them in ways they may not even be aware of.\"30 30. Skift trends report. The rise of transformative travel (Skift, 2018)Related trends: Extended reality , New business models, Rise of the middle class , Services moving online , Spread of the Internet , Sustainable productionSocietyTechnology Environment Economy Politics Science Where to from here? Society Foreword There are several possible explanations for the growth of the experience economy. Some see it as a reaction to the increasingly digital nature of our lives - in a world where we are always connected and spend so much time interacting in cyberspace, the marginal value of the physical world increases. We may no longer need to go to a physical shop, office, or restaurant but we choose to do so because of the value of experiencing social interactions and different environments. In the same way, we seek out more in-person experiences and greater cultural participation, rather than simply the acquisition of more 'stuff'.31 Others understand the experience economy trend as a natural progression in attitudes to consumption for the growing middle classes who may have reached 'peak stuff'. As wealth increases, there comes a point where material status symbols become less attractive compared to services and experiences that can lead to 'self-actualization' by helping people achieve their aspirations.32 Some people even speak of a 'transformation economy' emerging, where experiences are no longer about enjoyment, but about personal transformation. Increasingly, these experiences are facilitated by new technologies (e.g. 4D cinema, virtual reality), especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. 31. Digital megatrends.

Future Outlook. 100 Global Trends for 2050 (UAE Ministry of Cabinet Affairs and the Future, 2017) 33. Future possibilities report 2020 (UAE Government, 2020)Yet another perspective is that the experience economy is, in part, a reaction to increasing societal concern about sustainability and ' Environmental degradation ' (see ' Sustainable production '). People looking to consume less are driving the growth of the sharing economy, and the rise of rent and subscription models for things (from furniture to cars and even clothes) and services (from transport to accommodation).33 These models allow consumers to experience/use products without owning them, and to enjoy more interactive services usually linked to an idea of greater authenticity and responsibility. Overall, what this means is an important shift in economic value-generation, from products to services, and an imperative for producers/retailers to rethink how they provide customer experiences and create a service culture. This includes using new technologies (albeit with the caveat that technological developments must support the provision of personalized service and people's desire for emotion and intimacy, not replace them).SocietyTechnology Environment Economy Politics Science Where to from here?

Society Foreword Sustainable production Consumers are becoming more environmentally aware and more empowered. Studies show that around 65% of consumers are willing to pay more for products/services that are environmentally friendly and socially responsible, and they also increasingly expect companies to pay attention to the environment and be transparent about their behaviours.34 This sentiment is especially strong amongst the younger generations and is predicted to grow. At the same time, governments are putting pressure on industry through environmental regulations, as they reflect the growing environmental concerns of their electorates and put in place policies to help them achieve their commitments to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As a result, 'going green' has become an important business strategy and increasingly, companies are redesigning their business models to be more environmentally friendly and sustainable. This includes adopting life cycle models such as cradle-to-cradle (circular economy), sharing economy or peer-to-peer economic models (see ' New business models '), reducing emissions and creating shorter supply chains.35,36 And it is not just about reputation and marketing - companies also adopt sustainable business models to foster innovation, improve operational efficiency, and lower costs. While this trend of increasing demand for eco-friendly and sustainable products has been evident (and growing) for many years now, a more recent countertrend of climate 34. Beyond the Noise.

Older generations, in particular, do not trust what scientists say on environmental issues (53% of 60-74-year-olds compared to 39% of 16-24-year-olds).

Society Foreword Customized products Personalization of the customer experience has been a growing trend for some years now. One clear example of this is in the digital world, where, for example, services offered by Google, Facebook, YouTube, Apple, etc. curate searches, news feeds, products, advertisements and more based on a user's personal history of searches, purchases, and online interactions.38 Digital platforms and the increased connectivity of customers also offer customization of physical goods - through digital platforms, customers have products and services available at their fingertips and the digital medium allows them to specify instantly and conveniently what they want, providing feedback to companies on what to produce. Technological advances in ' Additive manufacturing ' (3D printing), machine learning and the 'Internet of Things ' (IoT) will likely accelerate this trend, reducing the cost to businesses of customizing their products and services. This affects business models (most companies already view customization as a strategic priority and may move away from mass manufacturing models)39 and could also affect global value chains (which need to become shorter and more flexible, leading to changes in the nature of goods being shipped and the move of production closer to markets).40 While some industry surveys show that demand for customization and personalization is high, for example, 67% of respondents in a survey run by Adobe said customized content 38.

Society Foreword Movement of people Urbanization | Increasing migration Whether within or between countries, by choice or by force, these trends demonstrate that people are definitely on the move. As the global population grows, so do rates of urbanization and migration, with potentially significant social, political, and environmental implications (see ' Age groups '). There is a multitude of factors pushing people to move, including economic development, conflict, political instability and, increasingly, the impacts of climate change. More people live outside their country of birth than ever before and many of them end up in cities, which are growing in number, in size and in importance. Indeed, the power of cities as economic and social centres could potentially see them overtake countries as the dominant political entities in future (see ' Changing trade pattern '). If managed well, urban centres will foster social and economic development and more sustainable living. But in places where the pace of growth outstrips the resources to support it, this trend could compound social inequalities and lead to greater conflict. Urbanization Increasingly, people are moving from rural areas to cities, resulting in significant growth in urban populations. People are seeking the economic opportunities and increased quality of life that living in cities can offer. It is expected that 70% of the world's population will live in cities by 2045.43 43.

Paradox of progress (US National Intelligence Council, 2017)Particularly in the developing world, where urban planning has not anticipated substantial growth and resources are already stretched, increasing urbanization may create problems as well as opportunities in the coming decades. Historically, unplanned, or informal urban settlements have exacerbated inequalities49, and in many countries, service provision in these areas is not keeping pace with urban population growth.50 Rapid urbanization could lead to conflict in places where resources are insufficient and/or poorly managed51, but where it is well-managed it may yield significant benefits to urbanizing populations.52SocietyTechnology Environment Economy Politics Science Where to from here? Society Foreword Multiple city 'types' are expected to increase in number in the coming decades. Much of the attention around urbanization is focused on so-called 'mega-cities', usually defined as having populations of at least 10 million.53,54,55 While the number of mega-cities is expected to grow somewhat, the bulk of the growth in cities will occur in 'small' (under 1 million inhabitants), 'medium' sized (1-5 million inhabitants)56 and 'large' (5-10 million inhabitants) cities.57 The World Bank58 offers a classification of large cities: Global hubs: Cities that wealth and talent flow though. Examples include Singapore, London, and New York. Mega-cities: Cities with large populations that are 'population magnets' for their respective regions. Examples include Mumbai, Sao Paolo, Jakarta. Gateway cities: Cities that function as part of regional clusters that facilitate access to specific markets. Examples include Dubai, Almaty, Johannesburg. 53. Global Trends to 2030.

Future Outlook. 100 Global Trends for 2050 (UAE Ministry of Cabinet Affairs and the Future, 2017)Thinking of these functions of cities raises interesting questions for city planners and for the role of cities in global trade, both physical and digital. According to the European Strategy and Policy Analysis System59, \"When we say 2030 will be urban, this is not merely an expression of residency, it will be the way of life of society as a whole.\" Perhaps paradoxically, cities can provide opportunities for increased sustainability and reduction of environmental impacts. While cities are expected to be responsible for 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions, they are also places where proactive and innovative environmental management and urban planning can yield substantial benefits. Higher density living allows for more coordination of waste management, innovative energy management, reduced reliance on cars for transport and efficient distribution of food and other resources.

Society Foreword Politically, urbanization can increase the power of local governments, leading to more localized decision-making and, perhaps, more empowerment of citizens.61 Cities have been described as 'virtual islands'; places where resource allocation and generation/distribution of power can be managed within a relatively closed system to the benefit of all.62 The Inter- American Development Bank and the Inter-American Dialogue63 suggest we can look forward to a positive future in cities. Successful urban areas will be the ones that: improve services; enhance national and international connectivity (the Internet); ensure water and electricity supplies; raise levels of education and healthcare; anticipate adaptation to climate change plans and measures; consider greening cities; provide talent pools of technical specialists and other experts; secure efficient and reliable financial systems; cultivate cultural activity, and; provide citizens with two important benefits, i.e. an improved quality of life and increased productivity. 61.

In fact, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has noted that \"the greatest single impact of climate change could be on human migration.\" 68 The number of people displaced by conflict and political instability is also expected to increase.69 More refugees moving along new and existing migration routes will have implications for public policy and international governance. Economic development in the global south may also contribute to higher levels of international migration. While many assume that economic development will reduce the number of people emigrating in search of economic opportunities, in fact it is observed that economic growth leads to an initial increase in emigration, presumably as citizens are better educated and have more access to connectivity, transport and international job opportunities.

Diversifying inequalities | Rise of the middle class | Stagnating happiness levels The world is undoubtedly more prosperous today than it has ever been before. But the way that prosperity is shared across the globe is still far from equal and the trends that affect prosperity are far from simple. This is especially true if you consider the meaning of 'prosperity' to go beyond money, and include things like wellbeing and equality. Economic growth, demographic change and technological advances are just some of the complex forces driving these trends in prosperity. Diversifying inequalities Inequality is growing. While economic (income) inequality is often the focus of discussion, it is linked to many other types of inequality that are also on the rise, including gender, intergenerational, digital and racial/ethnic inequality.73 This trend of 'diversifying inequalities' also has strong links to many other trends. Although economic inequality between countries has reduced over the last 30 years (largely due to rapid economic growth in Asia), inequality within many countries has increased and is predicted to rise steeply in coming decades, if current trends continue.74 73.

Society Foreword Rise of the middle class The trend towards poverty reduction around the world has been ongoing for decades, in Europe for at least 50 years, and more recently in Asia and Latin America. In particular, extreme poverty (defined as living on less than USD 1.90/day) saw a huge decrease, from 36% of the world's population in 1990 to 10% in 2015.78 Some reports predict that by 2030, the majority of the world's population will be middle class (defined as those falling between 67-200% of the median income in a country)79, with the middle class in the Asia-Pacific growing at a tremendous rate, led by China and India. Indeed, by 2030, the Asia-Pacific region is forecast to be home to two-thirds of the global middle class, who will become the world's biggest spenders.80 As people get richer, they can shift their focus from survival to enjoyment of life, progressively seeking better quality (and more) goods and services. The rising middle classes could become a key engine of economic growth in coming decades, as they consume higher quality goods, travel more, invest more and improve their education levels. With more purchasing power and more access to information, they may develop a stronger political voice and create pressure in many parts of the world to strengthen democratic processes and institutions.81 At the same time, however, this will also lead to increased consumption of energy (largely fossil fuels in Asia and Africa) and could exacerbate risks related to climate change and 78.

Of course, the economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has slowed progress in reducing poverty and stalled the expansion of the global middle class, so some of these predictions may have to be revised once the longer-term effects of the pandemic become clearer.82 In a more pessimistic scenario where economic slowdown is protracted, some predict that a frustrated middle class, fearing a backslide into poverty, may become a force for instability or a bastion of populism. 82.

Society Foreword Stagnating happiness levels People are becoming more prosperous overall as the global middle class grows, but this growth is mostly in developing countries. In developed countries, by contrast, middle class wages and employment could be threatened by increased automation and global competition in low-cost manufacturing (for example, McKinsey estimated that as of 2014, two-thirds of households in developed economies had real incomes at or below their 2005 levels).83 Slow economic growth means that these citizens, who have come to expect regular rises in living standards over time, will no longer perceive any visible improvements, leading to public dissatisfaction, disappointment and stagnating happiness levels. As their societies also become more unequal, this dissatisfaction could even lead to social divisions and internal conflict.84 At the same time, governments will find it increasingly difficult to fund rising welfare costs and investment in public services without sufficient economic growth. In the absence of an economic miracle, governments will have to concentrate more on the other elements that can determine human happiness such as mental wellbeing and social connectivity.85 83.

New advances in many kinds of technologies pose potentially, significant ethical challenges (e.g. ' Artificial intelligence ' (AI), ' Biotechnology ', or decarbonization technologies). This coincides with our increasing use of these technologies, creating potential risks at a macro-level (e.g. cybersecurity of a nation's critical infrastructures) and at a micro-level (e.g. security of personal data and individuals' vulnerability to online manipulation). Such risks are certainly to be expected with the advent of disruptive technologies and they are the price we have to pay for the great benefits these technologies offer us; it is a question of how well we recognize and mitigate these risks so as to ensure that new technologies can be used for the benefit of all. Ethics of technology Many governments around the world are turning their attention to the ethics of technology and the implications of fast-developing technology for future societies. Ethics related to the use of ' Artificial intelligence ' for automated vehicles, automated decisions, and consumer interactions are topics that are frequently raised86 and governments will increasingly be expected to address concerns around digital harm, disinformation, antitrust and foreign interference.87 The AI-enabled technologies of the future must benefit 86.

While machines could behave without regard for human suffering, they may also more accurately calculate the costs of conflict. Complexities can be expected to arise if countries develop conflicting ethical and legal frameworks for AI, both in military contexts and more broadly.89 Other key ethical issues related to AI systems are about unwanted bias, eavesdropping, and safety, and industry is already busy trying to address these. The ISO/ IEC committee working on AI (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42) has collected 132 use cases for AI, including ethical considerations and societal concerns for each (for more details, see ISO/IEC TR 24030:2021, Information technology - Artificial intelligence (AI) - Use cases ). When considering the ethics of using AI, however, it is equally important to consider the ethics of not using AI. The risks of using AI are frequently discussed, but one question that is not addressed often enough is - when does it become unethical for us not to use AI? For example, if AI technology could predict the next pandemic or speed up vaccine development, one could argue that it would be unethical not to use this technology. There are plenty of examples like this, for 88. Global Strategic Trends. The future starts today (UK Ministry of Defence, 2018) 89. Global Strategic Trends.

But is this the right question if the proper use of AI-enabled autonomous driving can help save lives by reducing accidents overall? Of course, AI is not the only emerging technology that could pose significant ethical challenges in the future. Advancements in biotechnology could - alone, or in combination with AI - lead to the creation of synthetic life forms or augmented human beings, with enhanced physical or cognitive abilities. How to regulate technologies that can fundamentally alter human capabilities or change the human gene pool \"could prompt strident domestic and international battles\" in coming decades (see ' Gene editing ').90 Even technological advances to treat diseases could engender political debates about the ethics of access (since treatments are likely to be available only to those who can afford them).91 Not to mention continued ethical debates about genetically engineered crops and foods and their potential ecological or health- related consequences.92 As the climate crisis becomes more urgent, we may also soon face ethical issues related to the use of new technologies for SocietyTechnology Environment Economy Politics Science Where to from here?

While geoengineering technologies (carbon dioxide [CO2] removal and solar- radiation management) have for many years been considered morally unacceptable, they are now gaining more attention as potential solutions of last resort.93 Ethical concerns here range from distributive justice for future generations or vulnerable populations (negative effects of geoengineering actions could disproportionately some countries or populations e.g. by increasing drought in Africa and Asia), to procedural justice questions (who should decide to use these technologies and how?).

Many sources agree that there is a clear trend towards the progressive loss of privacy that accompanies new developments in technology. According to the UK Ministry of Defence, \"In the coming decades, every facet of one's life is likely to be recorded by the ubiquitous presence of wearable devices, smart sensors and the ' Internet of Things ' .\"95 But at the same time, there is also a trend towards emphasizing privacy, for example, using privacy by design development. Once privacy- respecting technology is available, the market has the choice, and the global success of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) principles is an indicator of this trend.96 The use of biometric data, such as fingerprints and facial mapping, is increasing in both private (e.g. social media and personal technology products) and public (law enforcement and population surveillance) contexts.97,98 Consumer trust will be an increasingly important issue as technology becomes increasingly prolific in everyday activities.

Initiatives allowing the creation of 'digital trust', such as Yelp and Foursquare, are thus likely to grow in popularity.103 Once society acknowledges that data has a value and therefore the data owner needs to be paid, a 'new balance' will be established. The question is, if and when such an acknowledgement may come...? In the meantime, to reassure consumers, both government regulation and business leadership are necessary to establish privacy and data management standards that keep pace with emerging needs.104 Indeed, this will be a growing consumer expectation.105 Ultimately, it seems inevitably that technology will permeate almost everything we do and lead to enormous improvements in quality of life across society.

Looked at from a slightly different perspective, the vulnerability of individuals is also set to increase because of their online exposure. For example, more people will get their information online, leaving them potentially more exposed to misinformation ('fake news'), which could be used to manipulate individuals or even on a larger scale to influence public opinion.117 To effectively mitigate these risks related to cyber-vulnerability, people cannot rely on government action alone - society needs to be the driving force.

Society Foreword The changing nature of work Effects of automation | Reinventing the workplace History has seen several industrial revolutions that have each dramatically changed the labour market, as means of production and levels of productivity have continually evolved with the introduction of new technologies. Today, new technologies are converging to make for even faster progress and more disruptive changes to the nature of work. Automation will change the kinds of jobs needed in the future, while digital technologies and societal preferences will change how and where we work. Thus, not only is the definition of 'workforce' changing, but the scope and focus of what a human resource department does may be shifting from being 'workforce focused' to 'human capital focused'. Effects of automation The increasing automation of industry is already a very observable and well-studied trend. With advances in ' Artificial intelligence ', 'Smart manufacturing ', and ' Robotics ', the ability of machines to perform tasks more effectively than people is steadily increasing. This will have enormous consequences for the global employment landscape, with some studies predicting that, at the global level, \"automation could eliminate 9% of existing jobs and radically change approximately one-third in the next 15 to 20 years\" .119 What sets this industrial transformation apart from those that came before it is the speed at which it is occurring. This 'Fourth Industrial Revolution', as it is often known, is happening so rapidly that careful governance will be required in order to maximize its potential benefits. 119. Global trends 2040.

Society Foreword While many studies focus on the potential job losses that could result from automation, it is important to keep in mind that, at least in the longer term, automation will also result in significant job creation. It will create new kinds of jobs, removing the need for humans to do unsafe, boring, and repetitive tasks, while increasing productivity and giving workers more flexibility and leisure time than in the past.120,121 These new jobs will likely require higher-level technical skills and more social and/or creative skills than the jobs that will disappear.122 Of course, the ability of individual countries to benefit from automation varies significantly depending on several factors: Demographics: Countries with ageing populations will likely promote faster adoption of automation to replace and augment their ageing workforces, especially in sectors such as health, aged care, mining, and agriculture.123,124 Automation in countries with younger populations and a growing workforce could, on the one hand, have more disruptive effects and potentially exert a downward pressure on wages.

What's more, a lot of manufacturing could be 're-shored' back to developed countries by using robots, which would decrease opportunities for developing countries to grow their economies through export-led manufacturing.126 But advanced economies will not be unchallenged either - they may see revenue shortages as the number of workers paying tax decreases, and they may be more susceptible to societal upheaval as segments of their populations who are used to experiencing a steady growth in living standards become more disadvantaged.127SocietyTechnology Environment Economy Politics Science Where to from here?

In countries where women tend to have lower education levels and fewer technical skills than men, their jobs may be at greater risk from automation, and this may lead to women being disproportionately excluded from the workforce.128 Therefore policymakers will need to ensure that sufficient retraining and upskilling initiatives are put in place to make the transition as smooth as possible, in particular for low and medium-skilled workers and (in some cases) women.129 Relevant ISO technical committees and standards ISO/TC 184, Automation systems and integration ISO/TR 23087:2018 , Automation systems and integration - The Big Picture of standards ISO/TC 232, Education and learning services ISO 29994:2021 , Education and learning services - Requirements for distance learning ISO/AWI TR 29996 , Education and learning services - Distance and digital learning services (DDLS) - Case studies ISO/TC 299, Robotics ISO/TS 15066:2016 , Robots and robotic devices - collaborative robots Relevant ISO news stories ISO - New (e-)takeoff for aviation industry ISO - From high-tech gadgets to the smart enterprise ISO - Unearthing the potential of autonomous mining with ISO 17757 ISO - Robots and humans can work together with new ISO guidance 128.

Society Foreword Reinventing the workplace While automation is changing the kind of jobs that dominate the employment landscape, other new technologies and societal pressures are transforming workplace culture and how we work. Digital technology is allowing more people to work remotely and with much more flexible schedules. This trend did not begin with the COVID-19 pandemic but has certainly been accelerated by it - the pandemic led to a dramatic increase in the number of people working remotely and in the use of videoconferencing and virtual meetings, alongside a large decrease in business travel and the use of physical office space.130 Surveys show that these trends align with the preferences of the great majority of millennials (92% want to work remotely and 87% want to work according to their own schedule131) and allow people to better balance their work and home lives. However, there are also potential negatives some workers may suffer increased stress levels due to being continually connected to work132, while others may become disengaged and less productive, as they lose their physical connection to co-workers and a dedicated workspace.133 Organizations are therefore facing the double challenge of investing in the necessary technologies to enable a hybrid or remote work environment in order to attract and retain the best talent, while also developing strategies to combat increased employee stress or fragmentation and disengagement of their workforce. 130.

With digital capabilities alone no longer serving as a differentiator, future-minded business leaders will need more in their technology arsenals to succeed.134 Innovative technologies are catalysts for change, offering businesses extraordinary new capabilities. ' Distributed ledger technology', ' Artificial intelligence ', 'Extended reality ' and 'Quantum computing ' (known collectively as DARQ technologies) will be the next set of emerging technologies to spark profound change, letting businesses reimagine entire industries.135 In fact, individual DARQ technologies are already making a difference across industries today. But collectively, the DARQ technologies will also power the innovation and opportunity uniquely associated with the coming post-digital era. As the business landscape becomes increasingly dominated by digital natives and companies that have undergone successful digital transformations, DARQ is the key that will open unimagined new pathways into the future.136 134.

The post-digital era is upon us (Accenture, 2019)Society Technology Environment Economy Politics Science Where to from here? Technology Foreword Artificial intelligence AI today includes a whole host of technologies from data science to computer science, to electronics and social disciplines.137 It is a very broad field within information technology that is enabling the digital transformation of industry and society by creating computers that have the ability to learn as they are programmed to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence. This includes reasoning, problem-solving, understanding language, making predictions or inferences, and perceiving situations or environments. Essentially, it involves computers being able to provide better, deeper, and otherwise practically unachievable insights in an efficient way by leveraging computer-learning algorithms. This trend is about the rapid adoption of AI technologies whose increased capabilities and applications have the potential to reshape almost every industry and profession as they fundamentally change the ways in which humans interact with machines.138 This should be considered a megatrend because of the scale and geographic reach of its potential economic and societal impacts. The projected impacts of AI are significant. Many different projections and estimates exist, but to provide an example of the magnitude of these projections, UN Conference on Trade and Development's Digital Economy Report139 estimates that AI has the potential to generate USD 13 trillion of additional global economic output by 2030, contributing an additional 1.2% to annual GDP growth. The Future Today Institute predicts that the global AI market will grow at a CAGR of 42.2% from 2021 to 2027 .140 137.

Some key examples include: Changing the labour market: With AI's huge potential to boost productivity and economic growth, it will certainly have a significant effect on the labour market. In the short term, automation driven by AI (e.g. 'Robotics ') could introduce some disruption to many current jobs.141 But in the longer term, AI promises to create a significant number of new jobs; jobs which can remove the need for humans to do unsafe and repetitive tasks (see 'Effects of automation ').142 Better healthcare: AI is already transforming healthcare in areas such as pathology and radiology, by improving the speed and accuracy of diagnosing diseases such as breast cancer.143 In future, AI will facilitate personalized medicine and drug 141.

Technology Foreword More efficient and effective governance: AI could help formulate and evaluate the effectiveness of government policies and even be used to perform legal tasks that require the sifting and analysis of huge amounts of data.151 Challenges and risks Although the expected benefits of AI are enormous, good governance of the technology will be essential if we are to realize them. The development of appropriate legal and ethical frameworks for AI will be critical to build societal trust and to mitigate the potential risks and challenges. International Standards will have an important role to play as part of such frameworks to ensure the responsible adoption of AI. Social implications: Because the ability to adopt and benefit from AI is dependent on the presence of adequate digital infrastructures, relevant technical skills in the workforce, and appropriate regulatory systems, AI has the potential to widen the technology gap between those that have the capabilities to benefit from it, and those who do not. This is the case in terms of both countries and companies (large corporations may 151. Global Strategic Trends. The future starts today (UK Ministry of Defence, 2018) 152. 2021 Tech Trends Report.

For example, AI is learning to do things that even humans often find difficult - reading human expressions, interpreting the emotions behind them, and analyzing a person's level of emotional engagement. Researchers are even working on teaching AI to convincingly exhibit human emotions.155,156Society Technology Environment Economy Politics Science Where to from here? Technology Foreword Legal and ethical implications: Advanced AI that can make autonomous decisions could be applied to medical diagnoses, legal judgements or even used in warfare. This could be problematic because of the risk of bias in AI - if given incorrect or skewed data, this could lead to algorithmic discrimination being deployed on a large scale (e.g. some facial analysis AI has been shown to be less accurate at identifying minorities and women, because the data it was trained on was not representative).157,158 AI has the potential to reduce the impact of human biases, but only if humans can identify and adequately address bias in AI. 157.

Technology Foreword Extended reality Extended reality (XR) refers to environments that combine the real and the virtual, through the use of computer technology and wearable devices. XR technologies consist of virtual, augmented and mixed reality (respectively VR, AR and MR).159 Each of VR, AR, and MR defines a specific technology to reach XR, including the Metaverse. VR is fully digital and immersive, AR can digitally enhance our view of the real world and more recently, MR can create a hybrid reality where virtual and real worlds coexist. XR technologies are transforming the way that people interact, live and work by offering access to a new mode of social interactions within the digital space.160,161 The endgame is the full development of the Metaverse, an online digital world where people can interact with each other and with the computerized environment to do a variety of activities as an extension of reality. Part of the emerging DARQ technologies, XR is a building block in many companies' innovation strategies, with the power to significantly transform industries.162 With the combined global spending in AR and VR expected to reach USD 160 billion by 2023163, and repercussion in both leisure and business sectors, this is a trend with rapidly increasing significance. 159.

Technology Foreword The experience economy: from ownership to usership in the digital space AR and VR immersive technologies have been in use for some time already (especially, in online games), but their application is increasingly business-focused, helping the field's rapid expansion. Epic Games' Unreal Engine for example, used in the popular Fortnite game, created an online, digital space for users to exchange and participate in a multiplicity of experiences. This gaming engine can also be used for business purposes, with architectural firms using it to showcase their designs to clients, or Finnair using it to build a digital twin of Helsinki Airport for staff training purposes, for example.164 The uptake of XR technology in business can be linked back to other societal trends, such as the development of 'The experience economy'. The experience economy is slowly replacing consumerism, where businesses sell experiences rather than a product. The customer is fully involved in the customization process, shifting its role from ownership to usership.165 With XR technologies becoming cheaper and more sophisticated, the opportunities for customization are endless, allowing users to 164.

In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic is accelerating the need to move everyday experiences to the digital space in order to limit physical interactions, and technologies are rapidly evolving to offer virtual access to a multiplicity of experiences in response to mobility restrictions and isolation policies such as teleworking.166 With such technologies, customers can try on outfits in the virtual space and see themselves from multiple angles, or travel and work from the comfort of their armchairs. XR technologies thus open the door to alternative approaches to address current social needs, from wellness tourism167 to training opportunities and even criminal rehabilitation, simulating real life scenarios to prepare offenders before their reintegration into society.168Society Technology Environment Economy Politics Science Where to from here? Technology Foreword Innovation in communication and visual technologies accelerating the uptake of XR technologies This expansion in XR use is driven largely by innovations in communication and visual technologies that are improving the user experience and making these technologies more popular and accessible to the general public. Key enabling developments include portability, high speed Internet access, graphic and sound quality as well as GPS data, which increases the potential reach of those technologies.169 With the evolution of wearable XR technologies such as smart-glasses or contact lenses that include quality sensors, users can experience their surroundings with additional computer- generated inputs that appear real.170 In manufacturing, for example, the development of such sensors and AR glasses can help workers with efficiency and safety by giving hands-free access to user manuals and audio instructions, helping them locate items, tracking stock in real time or warning the wearer of equipment needing maintenance or showing defects.171 169.

Technology Foreword Risks The increasing use of cyberspace to perform everyday activities could give more influence and authority to non-traditional actors, possibly leading to the creation of new forms of authority beyond the individual countries.175 Already, such groups can use social media to exert significant societal pressures - one example of this is how users of Reddit (a social news aggregation, Web content rating and discussion Website), managed to shake the stock market with 'meme-stocks' and the coordinated buying of GameStop stocks by retail investors in 2021.176 In a pessimistic scenario, expanding the competitive space to the digital realm could also provide a new medium for conflict and warfare, which is already seen with the rise in cyber-terrorism. The virtual arena and XR technologies provide increasing opportunities for misinformation and propaganda, as well as avenues for cyber- attacks and hybrid forms of conflict.177 Another risk is that XR technologies might complicate pre-existing issues linked with digital technologies and social media, such as those related to the protection of identity and ownership, as well 175.

Additional trending technologies such as the roll out of ' 5G' will further support the development of XR experiences, by enabling more people to be connected at the same time to enjoy a quality experience with minimal latency.180 With other DARQ technologies, it holds the power to radically modify how we behave and interact and will be directly dependent on innovation in communication and visual technologies, with which it shares similar risks that must be addressed.Society Technology Environment Economy Politics Science Where to from here?

Technology Foreword Blockchain Blockchain technology is a form of distributed ledger technology (DLT), which provides unprecedented potential for removing intermediaries by allowing participating parties to exchange not only information but also value (money, contracts, property rights) without necessitating trust in specific, pre-determined intermediaries such as banks or servers.181,182,183 This is because DLT enables transaction data to be validated within a system wherein control is distributed among multiple, independent participants and stored in a manner that is tamper- evident and immutable by design. By ensuring system-wide agreement about the state of the ledger, DLT can be used to promote privacy, safety, transparency, and integrity of the transaction process.184,185 Distributed ledgers open up many new possibilities; for example, for monitoring the supply chain or managing digital rights. DLT is therefore regarded as a central enabler for digital, self- executing contracts, so-called smart contracts.186 Many industry leaders have already achieved significant business benefits, including greater transparency, enhanced security, improved traceability, increased efficiency, faster transactions, and reduced costs by DLTs.187 Financial services and banking are the most 181.

While cryptocurrencies (like physical money) are 'fungible', meaning they are equal in value and can be traded or exchanged for one another (one dollar is always worth another dollar; one Bitcoin is always equal to another Bitcoin), NFTs each have their own digital signature that makes it impossible for NFTs to be exchanged, as no two are equal (hence, non-fungible).193 NFTs are digital assets with programmed scarcity, and as such are ideal to represent ownership of unique virtual assets and digital identities in Web 3.0 and the Metaverse.194 188.

Blockchain Kenya's $20 Billion Informal Economy (Bloomberg, 2018)But blockchain can be used for a much wider variety of applications beyond cryptocurrency and the financial services and banking sectors. Although much focus is still put on monetary uses, there is an increasing interest in non-monetary uses and applications, e.g. digital identity, healthcare, supply chain, and energy.195 For example: In West Africa and Kenya, blockchain has enabled the efficient verification of property records and transactions, and expanded access to credit in some previously informal sectors of the economy.196 The London-based start-up Resonance uses blockchain to automate the transfer of product information between brands, manufacturers, and retailers. According to Resonance, over 30% of product data in product catalogues is wrong, with each error costing an average of USD 60 to fix. The innovative technology ensures that only trustworthy information is forwarded and is done so anonymously. The recipients first check the data sheets Society Technology Environment Economy Politics Science Where to from here?

The sticker is fitted with an array of sensors that identify issues such as location, acceleration, and temperature. The data collected in this way is managed by Streamr's blockchain network and based on smart contracts. The stickers can be used in the transport of goods, for example. Customers would only find out where they are currently located if the forwarder violates the previously agreed terms and conditions of transportation.198 In Australia Power Ledger has developed a blockchain-based platform that enables users to invest in major, renewable- energy projects.

Technology Foreword Edge computing Cloud technology allows users to access scalable technology services immediately via the Internet's existing network, promoting lower costs for infrastructure and inventory, reducing overheads, and creating leaps in computing power and speed, data storage, and bandwidth.204 However, it has one major problem - the latency (time lag or communication delay over the network) that results from the physical distance between users and the data centres hosting cloud-based services. This problem can be overcome using Edge computing; this is a different technology from cloud computing and its relevance is set to increase as the ' Internet of Things ' becomes ubiquitous and the sheer amount of data that needs to be moved and processed increases exponentially.205 This is because edge computing allows users to overcome the latency issue by performing computations near or at the source of data - data is processed directly on-site using dedicated hardware. Edge thus provides an important advantage when processing time- sensitive data, or when data processing is needed in a remote location where there is limited connectivity. In future, edge computing will be important for health care, automotive and manufacturing applications, because of the increased speed and security of processing data directly on devices (as opposed to sending it into the Cloud).206,207 Aside from reducing latency, edge computing has several other advantages, such as saving bandwidth and network costs, and enhancing security and privacy.208 Microsoft, for example, 204.

Intelligent transportation systems enable passenger information systems, vehicle monitoring and tracking systems, intelligent surveillance of transportation vehicles and stations, intelligent traffic management systems and more. Fleet management allows organizations to intelligently manage their vehicle fleets with a variety of rich information. Remote monitoring of oil and gas assets can be deployed in oil and gas fields where process conditions (such as extreme temperature variations) can be effectively and safely monitored and managed offsite.211 209.

Technology Foreword Quantum technologies Quantum technologies rely on the principles of quantum physics and cover a broad range of applied areas like quantum communication, quantum computing, quantum cryptography, quantum imaging, quantum metrology, quantum sensors, and quantum simulation. Quantum computing, in particular, could be a game changer and revolutionize the way we perform calculations.214 Quantum computers are the next generation of computers, which operate based on the laws of quantum mechanics and are made up of quantum circuits. The fundamental building-block of the quantum computer is the quantum bit or 'qubit', the quantum analogue of the binary digit or classical computing bit. The qubit can exist in two states (analogous to the '1' and '0' of the classical bit) as well as a superposition state (where it is both '1' and '0' at the same time). Because qubits can exist in multiple states at the same time, the quantum computer has the potential to be a hundred million times faster than a traditional computer. With its help, databases can be searched faster, complex systems such as molecular-level behaviour can be modelled and simulated to make better medicines and today's encryption technologies can be strengthened or cracked.215,216 In the future, it will be possible to book and obtain quantum computing power via the Cloud from providers such as Amazon and IBM, triggering the era of hypercomputation.217 214.

Technology Foreword Even though quantum could be considered the most nascent DARQ technology, investment has been growing rapidly and this investment is happening at multiple levels, e.g. from companies through to supranational institutions and countries. For example, China set up the world's first quantum cryptographic network (Jinan Project) in 2 017.218 Meanwhile, the European Union launched a quantum flagship initiative in 2018 covering quantum communication, quantum simulation, quantum computing, quantum metrology, and sensing as well as the basic science behind quantum technologies. With a budget of at least EUR 1 billion over ten years, the long-term vision of the flagship initiative is to develop a quantum Web in Europe, where quantum computers, simulators and sensors are interconnected via quantum communication networks.219 In terms of private sector advancements, major players like Google, Alibaba, IBM, Baidu and Hewlett Packard are all busy doing their own research.220 In 2021, IBM Quantum unveiled the Eagle chip, delivering 127 qubits on a single IBM quantum processor for the first time with breakthrough packaging technology. Eagle broke the 100 -qubit processor barrier and is leading quantum computers into a new era. IBM anticipates that, with Eagle, users will be able to explore 218.

For example, the quantum computer market of the future is only predicted to grow to about the size of today's supercomputer market, worth around USD 50 billion (as compared to today's market for classical computing devices, which was already worth over USD 1 trillion in 2019) and, even by 2030, none of the smartphones, tablets and computers in use will be quantum powered.222Society Technology Environment Economy Politics Science Where to from here?

Connectivity Spread of the Internet | 5G | Services moving online Connectivity acts as one of the drivers towards a more pluralistic world, deepening connections between businesses, services, and communities across the globe. Mobile, or wireless, technologies (mobile phones, tablets, and other wireless devices) have become basic communication tools of everyday life. These enable billions of people around the world to stay connected. For many worldwide, mobile is the primary - and sometimes the only - channel for accessing the Internet and the benefits it brings.223 The number of connected devices on the Internet is projected to reach 50 billion any time from 2025 onwards.224 Consumer demands are shaping the development of mobile broadband services. Anticipated increases in traffic (estimated to grow between 10 and 100 times in the period from 2020 to 2030), growth in the number of devices and services, as well as demand for enhanced affordability and user experience, will require innovative solutions. Spread of the Internet The spread of the Internet influences almost all current and future trends, with repercussions across all sectors, connecting systems and people at an exponential rate and facilitating the digitalization of businesses and everyday services (see ' Services moving online '). Indeed, \"some estimates indicate that the Internet's influence over the next 15 years will exceed the 223. 5G.

Effective cybersecurity will therefore be vital if society is to benefit from all the Internet has to offer, without exposure to threats from malicious (state and non-state) actors who can use cyberspace as a battle arena, with impacts ranging from outages of 225.

Meanwhile, improving digital infrastructures will be key to dealing with the major challenge of unequal access to the Internet. Access already varies greatly both within and between countries and, in least developed countries, only 20% of people use the Internet largely due to inadequate infrastructure, making it slow and expensive.229 More generally worldwide, digital divides exist between rural and urban areas, between genders, and ' Age groups '. Because Internet access variability can reinforce pre-existing inequalities, connectivity differences are one factor that will contribute to defining the inequalities of tomorrow (see ' Diversifying inequalities '). Taking action to address such connectivity differences will ensure more countries can access global markets and more people can connect and benefit from technological innovation. Accounting for current efforts, optimistic scenarios suggest that global Internet penetration could reach 90% by 2030, with 75% of the world's population having mobile connectivity, and 60% having broadband access.230,231 Technology Foreword Society Technology Environment Economy Politics Science Where to from here? Because the Internet has the power to spread false, misleading, or harmful information just as easily as it provides truth and knowledge, another challenge for regulators revolves around Internet censorship and safety. While there are legitimate reasons to censor harmful Internet content, access can also be used as a means of political control. States can limit or control platforms for Internet access, for propaganda purposes, and to restrict access to information. To date, over 23% of countries still ban or censor news, and, in some cases, shut down access to certain sites, effectively reducing their citizens' access to digital information and resources.232 Nevertheless, the Internet remains a valuable tool for citizens to search for more sources of information beyond state-controlled media.

Meanwhile, 5G is expected to be faster, connecting more people, things, data, applications, transport systems and cities in smart, networked, communication environments. It should transport a huge amount of data much faster, reliably connect an extremely large number of devices, and process very high volumes of data with minimal delay.233,234 Whereas 4G systems, for example, have opened a new era for mobile Internet, enabling many app-based businesses used for services such as m-Learning, m-Health and mobile money, 5G is seen as opening yet another new era, supporting applications such as: smart homes and buildings; smarter and cleaner cities; self-driving cars and other intelligent transport systems; 3D video; work and play in the Cloud; remote medical services; virtual and augmented reality (see ' Extended reality '), and; massive machine-to-machine communications for industry automation and manufacturing. The 3G and 4G networks currently face challenges in supporting these services.235,236 Although the business cases and scope of use present challenges, these new functionalities and new services necessitate a new way of deploying advanced mobile services, as well as new approaches to making 5G technologies work together in industrial settings by machine- to-machine communications, the ' Internet of Things ' or with connected vehicles.237 233. 5G.

The advent of 5G has arrived, and with it comes a world that is better connected and more powerful than ever before: 5G rollouts are happening worldwide. The US, UK, Germany, and South Korea already have 5G in some regions, with many more countries planning to follow suit.238 South Korea's SK Telecom hit one million 5G subscribers in the first 140 days of service, surpassing its 2011 4G LTE uptake.239 And 5G is expected to account for 40-50% of global mobile connections by 2034.240 In 2019, carriers AT&T and Verizon both launched their 5G networks in more than a dozen US sports stadiums. The concentration of people, along with an augmented reality experience use case, made these venues the ideal place to test the early rollouts. In the stadium, fans could connect to the network and participate in AR experiences through their smartphones, such as dancing with virtual National Football League players.241 238.

The Mobile Economy 2019 (GSMA, 2019)The record-breaking speeds, capacity for a higher number of connections and minimal latency of 5G are enabling a new frontier in the IoT. In the healthcare industry, technologists are already developing 5G devices to enable remote surgery, which would allow for highly specialized training of the next generation of doctors and bring previously inaccessible healthcare to populations worldwide.242 5G wireless technology is expected to be critical for the IoT due to its greater ability to handle massive volumes of data: 5G networks can process around up to 1,000 times more data than today's systems.243 In particular, it offers the possibility to connect many more devices (e.g. sensors and smart devices). It is estimated that by 2025, the United States, followed by Europe and the Asia-Pacific, will be leaders in 5G adoption. In order for developing countries to maximize the impact of the IoT, significant investments in 5G infrastructure will be required. By 2025, the share of 5G in total connections is expected to reach 59% in the Republic of Korea, compared with only 8% in Latin America and 3% in sub-Saharan Africa.244 Moreover, the deployment of 5G may further Technology Foreword Society Technology Environment Economy Politics Science Where to from here? increase the urban-rural digital divide, as setting up 5G networks in rural areas with lower demand will be commercially challenging.245,246 Estimates put 5G as contributing up to USD 12.3 trillion to global economic output over the next decade.247 Rapidly maturing technologies are expanding businesses' experience customization capabilities, making the balance between customization and consumer choice increasingly critical: as 5G networks are expected to enable faster and more interconnected networks of people and devices, the opportunities are growing quickly.

Services moving online The development of digital technologies such as ' 5G', 'Internet of Things ', 'Artificial intelligence ', machine learning and big data, is leading to an increasing number of services moving online (we define services here as the result of interactions/activities performed between a supplier and a customer/user). Such services include business activities (including business to business), finance, e-commerce, education, healthcare, and the entertainment industry with e-sports, ' Extended reality ' gaming and e-tourism. While such a shift towards online platforms can positively increase accessibility and connectivity, it can also increase digital inequalities and cybersecurity issues if left unregulated. The digitalization of services has strong implication for the future of trade and business interactions: it can make shorter supply chains economically viable, in addition to increasing the market reach of companies with an online presence.250 Some analysts suggest that the digitalization of the economy will significantly increase in the next 20 years, where many global activities will be \"digitally intermediated, customized, on demand and globally distributed.\"251 During the period 2020-2021 alone, the pace of change in this trend was significantly accelerated due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced many businesses and individuals to both provide and access online services because of social distancing and movement restrictions. In terms of education, this meant the implementation of innovative teaching and learning methods. For healthcare, as communities faced lockdowns and isolation, and hospitals were under pressure to deal with the outbreak, the availability of virtual doctor's appointments and health tracking apps for diagnosis and monitoring enabled a certain continuity of service for the population.

Overall, both public and private initiatives for digital platforms are emerging to offer products and services online.255 The effect of digitalizing some sectors will, of course, also disrupt the job market negatively, reducing the need for certain jobs. However, studies suggest that \"the vast majority of jobs of the future do not exist yet\" , which leaves space for adaptation to the new job market needs created by the online services sector.256 252.

Value Creation and Capture: Implications for Developing Countries (UN Conference on Trade and Development, 2019)At the same time, the recent expansion of digitalized human interactions and online services can also exacerbate or create new inequalities. When workplaces and schools moved their operations online during the COVID-19 pandemic, those that lacked the digital knowledge and skills, the practical tools, or the available infrastructures (e.g. laptop computers and Internet connectivity - see ' Spread of the Internet ') to successfully transition, were at risk of being excluded.257 These digital inequalities are growing, not only between, but also within countries, with age and socio-economic status being key players (see ' Diversifying inequalities '). In addition, the development of online services can be linked to power concentration and monopolies. A few digital platforms are getting most of the benefits from services moving online, and have strengthened their position thanks to the pandemic, making it difficult for new providers to enter the market.258 \"Digital power concentration could confine political and societal discourse to a limited number of platforms that have the capability of filtering information and further reduce the already limited agency of Technology Foreword Society Technology Environment Economy Politics Science Where to from here? individuals and organizations over how their data are used.\"259 This leads to an increase in regulatory pressure from governments to protect online consumer rights by targeting anti- competitive behaviour and monopolization, ensuring providers' responsibility for aspects such as illegal activities on their platforms, and the protection of privacy.

A key challenge, however, is the need for engineering innovation to work in coordination with information technology innovation, as the physical meets the digital. Developing common languages and other commonalities in this pluri-disciplinary field will facilitate future development of these systems. In addition, as with many technological advances, unintended consequences of integrating cyber-physical systems are likely to emerge in future, and it is therefore important to think ahead about the ethics surrounding these systems and how future regulation can limit risks related to safety, responsibility, liability, privacy and more.

The agricultural sector will increasingly use robots for manual tasks such as seeding, weeding, and harvesting, with sensors improving in their ability to identify ripe produce, harvest plants and detect disease.268 A range of military applications is anticipated, raising increasingly complex ethical questions. If terrorist organizations and non-state armed groups have access to this technology, it will increase the complexity of conflict.269 The automotive and transportation sector will move towards increasing production and use of ' Autonomous vehicles ', made possible by advances in robotics and other emerging technologies (see ' 5G').270 The carsharing company Uber, for example, is currently expanding its driverless-car programme. This may lead to a reduction in private car ownership and use.271 As robots increase in power, their applications are likely to grow. Computing for robots is now possible in the Cloud, increasing their processing power and speed.272 Advances in sensors, speech-recognition technology and computer vision will all contribute to more advanced robotics products, including robots that are able to operate in uncontrolled settings - known as 'open-world autonomy'.273 268.

Autonomous vehicles Autonomous vehicle technology is not a one-size-fits-all concept, as there are different considerations and implications for road, ship, or rail transport. The degree of automation can vary as well, and classified in ranges from Level 0 (fully manual) to Level 5 (driverless). The following discussion explores autonomous vehicles as a high-level trend only, where autonomous vehicles are understood as all forms of driverless transport systems. Autonomous vehicles are already used in industrial settings, in some public transport systems (e.g. driverless trains), and automation technology is increasingly integrated in our cars (e.g. cruise control, self-parking technology or traffic jam pilot).274,275 While the autonomous vehicle market is growing as a whole, with an expected CAGR of over 39% from 2019 to 2026, the deployment of fully automated (driverless) vehicles on public roads is still years away.276,277 The impact of more autonomous vehicles is likely to be double-sided. They may eliminate the need for drivers of vehicles of all kinds: trucks, taxis, and public transport vehicles, representing a significant labour force impact in the coming decades.278 At the same time, they may create opportunities for more efficient transport of goods and people to regional areas.279 Indeed, a significant, expected benefit to society is improved population mobility due to use of autonomous vehicles for public transport, particularly in rural areas.280 274.

Internet of Things The IoT refers to a system of interconnected devices embedded with software, sensors, and other technologies (such as digital twin, cloud computing, big data and ' Artificial intelligence '), which allows them to exchange data over the Internet for the purpose of improving functionality and monitoring. IoT systems are software and data-intensive, as well as network centric. They can be quite complex, ranging from simple architecture to systems which are multi-tiered, distributed, and ' Cyber-physical systems '. IoT systems are key enablers of 'smart everything', including smart homes and buildings, ' Smart manufacturing ', 'Smart cities ', and smart farming, but also wearable technologies, medical devices, and vehicles.284 Currently, there are twice as many devices connected to the Internet as people, and IoT connections are still expected grow at 17% per year.285,286 Experts predict that, by 2025, an average Internet user will be interacting with IoT devices nearly 4,900 times each day.287 This increased device connectivity will result in massive amounts of data, creating growing needs for data storage, analytical capacity, and data protection. The data gathered by these devices can contribute to improved strategies to reduce poverty in some contexts, as well as increased sustainability and environmental protection. However, the IoT could also pose risks, if data are not sufficiently protected, or if it is used for unethical purposes.288 284. Future possibilities report 2020 (UAE Government, 2020) 285.

Smart cities Cities are the future of human organization, with over two-thirds of the global population expected to live in urban areas by 2030.292 This raises significant challenges, including the allocation of resources to growing populations and the management of their consumption and waste. Smart cities are rising to address these challenges by integrating smart technologies to address citizens' needs more safely, sustainably, and efficiently, from goods and services to transport and logistics management. The World Economic Forum293 predicts that the technological tipping point for smart cities - that is, when they move from being novel entities to representing the norm - could occur as early as 2026. 'Smart' can mean different things to different people. In ISO, a 'smart city' is considered to be one with \"effective integration of physical, digital and human systems in the built environment to deliver a sustainable, prosperous and inclusive future for its citizens\" (ISO/IEC 30182:2017 , 2.14). Another helpful way to understand it is to look at smart as having three pillars: digital, physical, and economic. Digitally smart refers to the effective deployment of digital and communication technologies for city management. Physically smart refers to the adjustment and construction of sustainable infrastructures and processes that enhance the city's resilience and the residents' quality of life. Finally, economically smart refers to the effective collaboration between citizens and local businesses to share assets and resources to build a resilient community.294 The evolution of smart cities is closely linked to innovation in ' Internet of Things ', '5G' and DARQ technologies, ' Distributed ledger ', 'Artificial intelligence ', 'Extended 292.

They do this by integrating smart grids (see ' Energy '), energy-saving construction materials and buildings, efficient digital management systems for waste and other logistical needs and services to citizens.296 This results in a more efficient use of resources and resilient, better-connected systems. However, with this increased connectivity also brings risks related to privacy and big data sharing. Because a smart city depends on a highly interdependent connected network, this increases the risk that a security breach, hacking or technical issue such as a power cut could affect the entire system, with repercussions in all sectors.297 ,298 There is also a concern about the 'Big Brother' dilemma - for smart technology to efficiently relay information and adapt systems to residents' needs, big data must be collected using things like cameras, sensors, and IoT tools.299 To maintain citizens' trust in the smart city concept, effective policies and regulations will be needed to protect residents' privacy and personal information. Standardization plays an important role towards bringing trust amongst citizens, thanks to transparency and open processes, which is key for citizens acceptance and confidence. 295.

The question is, how will we ensure we have the materials for the future without compounding these problems? Many companies are developing alternatives based on renewable, biomass materials, including e.g. flax, mushrooms, and shrimp shells.303,304 The formulation of existing plastics can also be changed to make them more degradable305 and, finally, innovations in recycling technologies will make manufacturing the materials of the future more sustainable. As one of the largest sectors in the manufacturing industry, innovations in plastic production systems themselves are also a key driver of change. The data collected by more efficient sensors and smart machinery (see ' Internet of Things ') can improve the consistency of products, limiting defects (and ultimately reducing plastic pollution), reducing energy consumption and costs, and improving competitiveness.306,307 303.

Additive manufacturing Additive manufacturing produces objects through a process of layering together raw materials. This is different to traditional (subtractive) manufacturing, which creates parts out of raw materials.308 Additive manufacturing is widely known as '3D printing', but this style of manufacturing also Includes '4D printing', an emerging approach that allows the manufacture of products that respond to things like heat, light, and the passing of time.309 The use of additive manufacturing is expected to increase, with many new applications for both commercial and personal use. The ability to print products for personal use will open markets for blueprints and designs, while increasing the customization options available to consumers (see 'Customized products '). A potentially endless range of products could be manufactured using additive methods, including machinery parts, consumer goods such as shoes and furniture and healthcare products like hearing aids and prosthetics.310,311 If additive manufacturing grows, we can expect an increased impact on trade - perhaps a reduction in the transport of goods, along with an increase in the transport of raw materials. Overall, this would be expected to reduce global freight volume.312 Of course, additive manufacturing has some challenges, such as ensuring cybersecurity and management of intellectual property. Companies and governments will need to be attentive to emerging issues to ensure the benefits of additive manufacturing are enjoyed by all. 308.

Technology Foreword Energy sources | Energy storage and distribution Global energy use is increasing dramatically, primarily driven by increasing demand for electricity. In addition, energy-related CO2 emissions are too high to meet international commitments to the climate agenda by 2050. The only path to success will be through technological innovations leading to energy savings, low/zero carbon energy sources, carbon capture, and greater energy efficiency (see ' Environmental degradation ' for more on resource management and carbon storage). The number of potential power sources is expected to increase over the next 30 years, as technological innovations in energy production and storage make renewables and new generation batteries cheaper and more efficient. Changes in electricity markets, such as growth in developing countries and regionalization of energy systems, will set the scene for future evolutions in the sector. Although energy trends involve significant technological and societal aspects, they have been included in the environment section of this trend report because the evolution of the energy sector is so interdependent with the global climate agenda 2050. From greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction to energy efficiency and the increased use of renewable-energy sources for power, heat or fuel, future innovations and standardization work in the energy sector must take a sustainability lens. Energy as a mega trend has a multiplicity of facets, not all of which can be included in this report. We focus our discussion on energy issues including the diversification of energy sources, and innovations in access, storage, and distribution of energy, with a strong focus on the transport sector and electricity market developments.Energy Environment EnvironmentSociety Economy Politics Science Where to from here? Technology Foreword Energy sources The demand for energy continues to rise, linked to demographic and economic growth, especially in the transport, industry, and construction sectors.313 With developing countries' growing energy needs, it is expected that global energy demand will rise by 40-60% by 2050314 if we do not make additional energy savings.315 In parallel, the increasing awareness, pressure and need to reduce emissions and improve energy security demonstrate the need to reconsider energy production and use patterns across the globe. Already, the diversification of energy sources highlights progress in this area, with wind, solar, water, nuclear fusion, geothermal, bioenergy and others paving the way towards low-carbon economies. By 'energy sources', we consider here the resources or technical systems from which energy can be extracted or recovered to be transported by a medium such as fuel or electricity (see ISO/IEC 13273, all parts). Although batteries technically fit this definition, they will be reviewed in the Energy Storage section of this report. 313. Global Connectivity Outlook to 2030 (World Bank, 2019) 314.

This includes solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power sources. As economies become more reliant on electricity as a key energy carrier, renewables could, in combination with nuclear energy, provide over half of total electricity generation capacity by 2050.318 In addition, renewables are becoming competitive with fossil fuels faster than expected as prices drop, which has already started to 316.

Although nuclear energy production is unpopular in some countries due to the radioactive waste it creates and its connection to several recent accidents, it is nevertheless expected to increase in the future, with countries like China, India, South Korea and Finland planning to continue using nuclear power.321 In addition, technological innovations mean fusion fuel (deuterium and tritium) can now also be extracted more sustainably from water and sea water, and guidelines on waste management should increase its popularity in the future.322 Environment EnvironmentSociety Economy Politics Science Where to from here? Technology Foreword The future of fossil fuels Current low-emission and renewable technologies cannot keep up with increasing global energy demand.323 As a result, dependence on the use of coal and oil is likely to continue for the next 20 years, with projections showing that hydrocarbons might still meet around 70% of overall energy demand by 2050, even though demand is also expected to decelerate in the 2040s.324,325 Trade routes may shift, however, as countries in Europe reduce their reliance on fossil fuels and energy demand increases in emerging economies (especially with an expected growth in the number of cars), leading to a rise in oil trade between Asia and the Middle East.326 Asia might become the largest global market for oil exports, with scenarios suggesting that around 75% of the world's oil will be used in Asia, and China will likely consume more oil than the US as early as 2030.327 323.

At the same time, transition away from coal is predicted with renewables like wind, solar and hydropower to surpass coal as the main source of electricity by 2030.329 Recent announcements during the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 26) seem to support this prediction, with China and the US announcing a collaboration on environmental standards related to reducing emissions of GHGs in the 2020s.330 Environment EnvironmentSociety Economy Politics Science Where to from here? Technology Foreword The case of shale oil and gas, and liquid natural gas Shale oil and gas (extracted using fracking), and liquid natural gas (LNG) are also increasingly relied on as fossil energy sources. While they have been used for years, recent technological innovations have opened more commercially-viable reserves globally. This has shifted the balance of power from traditional oil exporters, to the US, for example, which is now the world's leading oil producer.331,332 As a region, southwest Asia/the Middle East is still expected to remain the largest hydrocarbon-based producing region in the next decades, but these countries are likely to become net energy importers as reliance on fossil fuel decreases.333 In this context, it is predicted that LNG will become a key export resource. The continued expansion of fracking will, however, strongly depend on the evolution of international efforts towards a low- carbon economy334, as drilling involves vast amounts of water, can contaminate groundwater and release harmful GHGs.

A key opportunity for the future is to consider green energy and alternative energy sources as a competitive advantage, rather than a costly transition, representing opportunities for development and job creation in future economies.337, 338 Environment EnvironmentSociety Economy Politics Science Where to from here?

The desired shift towards a net-zero economy is driving innovation in energy storage and research into direct power conversion.339,340 Our increasingly, complex energy sector is supplying more interdependent technologies which will require more efficient and cheaper tools to address energy demand. As a result, innovation in battery technologies, fuel alternatives, energy efficient (smart) appliances/buildings/cities, process energy-improvements (industry), and direct power conversion technologies such as fuel cells should be expected to distribute power to an increasing amount of people in the near future.341 339.

Technology Foreword Batteries Energy storage will play a crucial role in delivering lower-cost renewable energy in a more flexible and reliable manner. A major driver of energy storage technologies is to better integrate intermittent renewable-energy sources into the grid. As intermittency requires another energy source to fill in gaps, energy storage - and large battery banks especially - can provide a solution. The race for leadership in energy storage solutions that increase the market infiltration/diffusion of renewables has already begun, with organizations investing heavily in new battery technologies. Giant battery 'giga-factories' are being built around the globe to address the demand, as a testament to this increased interest. As of today, no battery can store and release significant volumes of electricity in an affordable manner. The next generations of batteries will need improvements to battery life and energy density, Battery production will also need to become cleaner and more efficient.342 Lithium-ion is the current leading battery technology, powering laptops and electric cars alike, but rare and expensive materials required to build these batteries means they also need to evolve. Battery technology has improved significantly over the last two decades and progress continues. Extensive research and development are currently underway to improve battery chemistry 342.

The future starts today (UK Ministry of Defence, 2018)and identify better battery constituents, to allow a greater energy- density at lower costs. Engineers are researching new cathode materials like graphene or hexagonal boron-nitride, and at replacing lithium with sodium, aluminum, or zinc to build cheaper products. Alternative research into solid-state batteries might also pave the way forward. Such changes could lead to smaller batteries that last longer, charge faster and conduct less heat.343,344 A consideration for the future, however, is the cost of energy storage using batteries. Storing and discharging electricity comes at a cost (capital plus energy consumption and losses) which must be added to electricity-production costs. Using power directly can ultimately be cheaper and investing in the efficient distribution and sharing/ trading of direct power sources could be a viable alternative long- term investment choice. Environment EnvironmentSociety Economy Politics Science Where to from here? Technology Foreword Power to X - Direct power conversion Power to X technologies, also known as direct power conversion, are technologies aiming to transform sources of energy (e.g. renewable sources like sunlight or wind and gases like hydrogen and methane) directly into heat, electricity, chemicals, or fuel through a process of electrolysis or synthesis. This energy can then be stored or used to manufacture goods and power various systems.345 Power to X technologies therefore provide potential avenues to help decarbonize energy-intensive industries with high CO2 emissions, such as construction, manufacturing, and transport. Green hydrogen has received particular attention for its potential to transform the energy sector, with the International Energy Agency (IEA) highlighting the role it could play in reducing global CO2 emissions. Green hydrogen is carbon-neutral and is produced using electrolysis from renewable resources, as opposed to the steam reforming of natural gases (fossil fuel) used to produce grey and blue hydrogen. Until recently, the high costs of producing and storing green hydrogen have been a major barrier to its widespread use, but technological advances (e.g. better electrolysers and surplus electricity) are now making green hydrogen an attractive option346 345.

Horizon scanning by Europe's technology leaders (European Commission, 2019) 350. Technical and economic conditions for injecting hydrogen into natural gas networks (GRTgaz, 2019)- trend reports suggest that efficient electrolysers to produce green hydrogen as cheaply as its grey or blue counterpart could be developed within the next decade.347 In addition, projects such as Gigastack explore the production of green hydrogen at industrial scale, integrating electrolysers directly into offshore wind farms to produce green hydrogen.348 Challenges remain however for the efficient storage and conversion of hydrogen and other Power to X innovations, and existing infrastructure will need updating to effectively integrate these technologies.349 A current transition strategy for lower-carbon fuel sources is the integration of hydrogen into natural-gas networks (to prepare for the development of power-to-gas processes), which improves the energy efficiency of the resulting fuel mixture.350 Environment EnvironmentSociety Economy Politics Science Where to from here? Technology Foreword Fuel substitution According to some forecasts, energy use in the transport sector might rise by 45% of 2010 figures by 2040.351 Improving energy efficiency and transitioning to alternative technologies to power the transport sector is therefore essential to achieve GHG reduction targets and reduce overall power consumption. The desire to shift our energy use away from fossil fuels has propelled research into 'clean cars', which are leading innovation in energy storage and distribution, with vehicles readily available in some markets. Clean cars can be defined as electrically-propelled vehicles using hydrogen fuel cells, batteries or a combination of methods also known as hybrid. This last category does, however, still rely partly on combustion engines, so considering them as clean is debatable. The main challenges facing clean cars are ensuring fuel economy for consumers, delivering performance and reliability at a cost competitive with conventional vehicles, and ensuring that electrical grids have the capacity to cope with the increased demand from clean cars. However, the emergence of clean cars also opens up possibilities of using the transport network as distributed-energy storage system within future smart grids.352,353 In such a system, 351.

Future Outlook. 100 Global Trends for 2050 (UAE Ministry of Cabinet Affairs and the Future, 2017)electric cars could act as batteries to absorb grid excess power during times of low demand and reinject energy in power grids at peak hours.354 Hybrid and electric engines should soon become the norm for personal vehicles and are expected to successfully compete with internal combustion engines by 2030 thanks to new generation batteries.355 Similarly, the rise of shale gas and biofuels suggests the share of natural-gas powered vehicles could also increase in regions where it is abundant (and therefore cheaper), though difficulties in storing natural gas (pressurized tanks) is a challenge that still needs addressing. The shape of the private-vehicle market and which system take the lead will strongly depend on incoming innovations and be driven by consumer choices in developing countries.356 Environment EnvironmentSociety Economy Politics Science Where to from here? Technology Foreword Commercial fleets, however, are still likely to rely on fossil fuel and diesel for some time to come. For alternative engines to truly compete with conventional vehicles, improvements will be required in terms of battery cost, size, weight and power to increase the range possible on a single charge; the number of charging points available; and the charging time required to power up the car.357,358,359 One key technology to watch is hydrogen-powered fuel cells as a potential solution for shipping and heavy vehicles.360 Commercial transport (buses, commercial vehicles, delivery fleets, and trucks) is often seen as the most promising sector to promote hydrogen as an energy carrier in order to cut emissions, though costs and efficiency improvements are required before the technology is ready to be scaled up.361 Innovations in other categories of the transport sector are also emerging, including hybrid systems for ships and aircraft. For ships, using natural gas, marine diesel-gas or heavy fuel-oil to power a tri-fuel diesel electric propulsion system is entering the market as a possible alternative. Another is the current transition towards shore-side power, whereby shipping ports provide electric power 357.

This transition is slow, however, filled with distrust and minimal investments.362 For aircraft, a full transition to electric is likely further down the line (2050+), whether it be battery or solar based, though battery-powered electric aircraft could start being deployed as early as 2025 for flights under 800 km.363 Environment EnvironmentSociety Economy Politics Science Where to from here? Technology Foreword Energy distribution The digitalization of the energy sector The digitalization of our economies, with advances in, for example, the 'Internet of Things ' and big data analytics, has radically changed energy transmission, distribution requirements and demand. Although this implies greater energy use, it also holds promises to optimize energy usage.364 The era of smart technologies is predicted to rapidly expand, but these technologies also raise new security and privacy questions that will need to be addressed (see ' Tech risks '). Similarly, electricity grids will become more complex, with more actors involved, creating greater challenges for risk management and greater potential for systemic failure.365 364.

The future starts today (UK Ministry of Defence, 2018) 367. Global Connectivity Outlook to 2030 (World Bank, 2019)Smart technologies 'Smart' technologies are not well defined, but generally refer to three kinds of objects: smart devices that can be programmed and have some level of automation but no connectivity (e.g. a smart thermostat or coffee machine); connected devices that are controlled via wirelessly through Bluetooth or Wi-Fi (e.g. wearables, smartphones), and IoT devices that connect to the Internet and can send and receive data between other devices and systems. In terms of energy storage and distribution, smart technologies (such as smart grids) will blur the lines between supplier and end user, by allowing businesses and households alike to track and generate their own energy supplies (and even share or sell their surplus). By including operational and energy measures along the supply chain (e.g. smart meters), and due to big-data analytics and machine learning, smart technologies could predict system failures or allow devices and systems to adjust energy use in response to specific conditions. The latter could include, for example. being active when supply is abundant and inactive or in battery-saving mode when supply is limited.366,367 This could lead to overall energy savings and more efficiency in the system. Environment EnvironmentSociety Economy Politics Science Where to from here? Technology Foreword Beyond those promises, smart technologies, as a whole, raise new security and privacy questions, such as how household, energy data is collected and stored in order to predict grid conditions. Guidelines and regulations will be required to protect users and promote good practice in how to deal with sensitive data and ensure privacy and security (see ' Data privacy ').368 Ultra high-voltage direct-current transmission lines Ultra high-voltage direct-current (UHVDC) transmission lines are expected to become the main electricity-transmission technology to enable a more efficient, bulk-power transfer over long distances, than alternating current (AC).369 Currently, over 250 gigawatts of interconnectors and high-voltage transmission links are installed globally, which is expected to increase exponentially towards 2030, with countries like China, India, the US, and the EU heavily investing in the technology.370 The higher voltage available in energy transmission technologies will enable the movement of energy as electricity over long distances 368.

Global Connectivity Outlook to 2030 (World Bank, 2019)rather than relying on moving energy resources themselves. By carrying electricity directly from the source to where it is needed and then used, it will be more efficient and potentially cheaper than existing technologies. This in turn will make it attractive to use and giving it the power to change the economics of energy distribution.371 This will have a significant impact on shipping in particular, which will no longer be needed to transport large quantities of coal and oil. Some estimates suggest that \"energy-related shipping might decline by 50% for coal and 25% for oil by 2050.\"372 It will also promote emissions reductions and the transition to a low-carbon economy. UHVDC can increase the attractiveness of renewables by addressing their apparent lack of reliability - by transferring electricity from areas with a surplus or high production capacity to other areas across interconnected systems, operators can adjust supply and demand efficiently.373 This is possible thanks to innovative sensors and controls that allow minute-by-minute variances in the direction and magnitude of flow. In addition, the reduced need to ship energy resources will help lower emissions from the transport industry. Environment EnvironmentSociety Economy Politics Science Where to from here? Technology Foreword Finally, UHVDC can also connect more people to the energy supply system. While the IEA reports that over 750 million people still do not have access to electricity, access is increasing rapidly.374 New transmission technologies could accelerate the spread of access to electricity and even lead developing countries to leapfrog in the energy sector375 - over the next 30 years, many countries in Africa are expected to potentially skip development phases that older economies have transitioned through, and move straight into digital and sustainable infrastructure. As a region where a majority of the population does not have access to electricity, this is expected to dramatically change the power dynamics in the energy sector. It is also an opportunity for African countries rich in natural resources to combine the development goal of access to electricity with resilient, low-carbon development.376 374.

Global Connectivity Outlook to 2030 (World Bank, 2019)The future of distribution: From state-based centralized systems to regional and local solutions Regional solutions: sub-national interconnected energy networks In the context established above, countries currently face a choice between pursuing electrification and distribution through a national agenda, or through an approach of energy interdependence at regional or local levels.377,378 Considering the commercial cost of investment in new transmission lines and other energy technologies, as well as resource limitations in any single country, cooperation and energy trade between countries yields many benefits. It can minimize energy-production costs and increase regional surplus through sharing infrastructure and resources, and taking advantage of the different renewable- energy profiles of participating countries in order to adjust supply and demand efficiently.379 \"In sub-Saharan Africa, where the cost of energy supply is amongst the highest in the world, regional trade may reduce costs by an average of 40%.\" 380 Latin America can serve as an example, as countries have largely invested in regional energy systems to reduce energy costs, improve reliability and diversify Environment EnvironmentSociety Economy Politics Science Where to from here? Technology Foreword the region's energy sources (see, for example, the Central American Electrical Interconnection System (SIEPAC), and the Andean Electrical Interconnection System).381 However, this regional approach is not without significant challenges, including those related to cooperation across multiple jurisdictions and countries, with varied infrastructures and legislation and the fact that existing electricity grid facilities in both developing and developed countries will need to be updated to accommodate renewable-energy sources, which are different from the infrastructure used for fossil fuels.382 381.

With such innovations, homes, cities, and local equipment could act as tools for electricity production, storage, and distribution, thereby removing local communities' reliance on centralized and state-based grids.383 This can lead to more resilient communities, with increased security of energy supplies for remote communities that have a reduced access to the grid, or in the event of natural disasters. It could also provide opportunities to generate income.384 However, with more actors involved, the complexity of the energy system would increase, and with it, the risk of failures.385 Environment EnvironmentSociety Economy Politics Science Where to from here?

Technology Foreword Natural resources scarcity | Threatened ecosystems The natural world has been irreversibly changed by human actions and this has led to long- term trends towards increasing environmental degradation and scarcity of natural resources. Both of these trends are closely interlinked and will pose significant challenges over the next few decades, requiring large-scale, international action to avoid the worst-case scenario. Human activities have resulted in air pollution, habitat destruction, soil erosion, desertification, ocean acidification and many other changes that are causing significant stress to ecosystems. With a growing global population, demand for fresh water and arable land for agriculture are expected to increase in the future. The development of new technologies (such as smart farming) will be essential to overcome some of these challenges. However, many such technologies, including clean energy technologies, require critical minerals that are also in short supply. Substantial efforts in terms of both mitigation (reduction of carbon emissions) and adaptation (changing behaviours, consumption patterns, resource management and more) will be required to maintain a level of ecosystem services needed for human wellbeing. Natural resources scarcity As the effects of climate change continue to impact the globe, precious, natural resources like fresh water, arable land and minerals are expected to become increasingly scarce, with significant implications for agriculture and food security, as well as the production of many new innovative technologies. According to the US National Intelligence Council, \"nearly all of the Earth's systems are undergoing natural and human-induced stresses outpacing national and international environmental protection efforts.\"386 The World Economic Forum identifies 386.

Only 3% of the world's water is freshwater, and much of this is is not readily accessible due to factors that include remote location, political boundaries, economics, and purity. The UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) estimates that 1.8 billion people worldwide will face water scarcity by 2025 and 5.2 billion are expected to face water stress. By 2050, the FAO estimates that only 60% of the water needed will be available.390 Although climate change may promote glacier melting that could lead to increased flows of water, higher temperatures are also expected to increase 387.

This is a serious challenge when projections estimate that average levels of food production will have to increase by around 50% by 2050 (from a 2012 baseline) to meet the needs of the world's population.394 Indeed, it is impossible to separate out the issues of water and land scarcity as each affects the other in a significant way. For example, around 70% of global water consumption goes to agriculture, agriculture will be responsible for a Environment EnvironmentSociety Economy Politics Science Where to from here? Technology Foreword large part of the increased demand for water in future395, and current intensive farming techniques are linked to water pollution, along with air pollution, soil degradation and pest resistance.396 Water scarcity and other consequences of climate change, such as volatile weather events and sea-level rise, will, on the one hand, reduce the amount of land available for developing new agricultural areas and, on the other hand, lead to reduced agricultural production. The resulting food insecurity is predicted to have a disproportionate effect on developing countries, with some predicting that \" Africa could face a near double-digit reduction in crop yields and production volumes over the next decade, as well as rising food prices by similar margins.\"397 Technology will need to play a major role in overcoming natural resource scarcity and improving agricultural productivity.398 'Smart farming' and techniques such as hydroponics and vertical farming will be key. Smart farming involves the use of digital technologies - e.g. unmanned machinery, robots, sensors, drones, big data, and advanced analytics - to be able to analyse the individual needs of specific fields, crops, or animals.399 This kind of precision agriculture 395.

Hydroponics (growing plants in mineral solutions instead of soil) and vertical farming (growing crops in vertically stacked layers) both reduce the need for land to grow certain crops and make it more practical to farm them in urban environments.400 Critical minerals and consequences for emerging technologies and the energy transition Scarcity issues also apply to lesser-known natural resources like critical minerals - rare metals such as lithium, tellurium and rare earth metals that are used for batteries, solar panels, and various electronic devices. Demand for these product types will only increase in the coming decades as more people join the middle class and purchase consumer electronics such as smartphones. In addition, as the global community steps up efforts to cut GHG emissions, and transition to cleaner sources of energy such as electric vehicles (which require a lot of lithium) and solar power, this will increase the demand for these rare metals. As this demand grows, pressure on these limited resources will be significant. Environment EnvironmentSociety Economy Politics Science Where to from here?

Technology Environment Economy ForewordChanging trade patterns | New business models Trade has been increasingly globalized in recent decades, but this trend is now slowing, and the future may see an increasing fragmentation and a shift towards regionalization and localization. Drivers of these changing trade patterns will include shifting consumption patterns (with, for example, goods produced in China increasingly being consumed in Southeast Asia), changes in the political environment (see ' Power transition '), changing consumer preferences (see ' Consumption'), and the growth of new business models that are made possible by new technologies (such as ' Blockchain ' and ' Additive manufacturing '). Changing trade patterns Regionalization / localization Although digital globalization looks set to continue apace, trade globalization has been slowing down over the past 10 to 15 years as the number of bilateral and regional trade agreements proliferates, and countries increase their use of restrictive, trade policy measures.415,416 Regional trade agreements may increase the intensity of trade between their signatory countries417 while regional connectivity initiatives (for example, the Master Plan on The Association of Southeast Asian Nations [ASEAN] connectivity) will make intra-regional trade more efficient.418 This may have particular impacts for developing economies - the African 415.

Cities will increasingly \"shape the dynamics of international trade\"421 over the next 30 years as more people move to urban areas because of better opportunities for work and education. Cities may even strengthen their position in the global economy to the extent that they \"could replace countries as the most important economic entities\" (see ' Smart cities ').422 419.

South-South Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) already make up more than half the total number of RTAs in the world, with the majority in Asia.423 Further South-South trade growth will be driven by an increase in demand for consumer goods from a growing middle class (often goods that are produced in emerging economies), alongside better communications and easier customs arrangements.424 Economy EconomySociety Economy Politics Science Where to from here? Technology Environment Economy ForewordWhat and how we trade The composition of trade flows and the means by which they are transported are evolving. In terms of what we trade, for several decades, international trade in services has grown at a much faster pace than trade in goods, and, despite being hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, global trade in a wide range of services (e.g. financial, communications, tourism) is expected to increase over the next 20 years.425 Trade in digital services (i.e. services provided over digital networks, such as computer network maintenance, entertainment, broadcasting, or financial management) is one area that has seen a huge growth recently (see ' Services moving online '), and this has led to a massive increase in the amount of cross-border data flows.426 Such cross-border data flows are essential for digital services trade but must also be carefully managed due to privacy concerns. Countries must ensure they place adequate restrictions on cross-border data flows to protect personal data and national security, without these restrictions being so severe that they negatively affect the level of digital services trade.427 The importance of trade in digital services means that all countries will have to make 425.

The digital divide (related to levels of connectivity and access to the Internet) and data-related dive (related to the ability to capture, analyze and transform data into digital intelligence) between developed and developing countries is therefore a major challenge to overcome.429 In terms of how we trade, climate change, new technologies and shifting customer preferences are all contributing to reshaping the trade and logistics sectors. The potentially disruptive effects of climate change are causing companies to modify the way they operate to increase the resilience and reliability of their supply chains.430 In some cases, this means the shortening of supply chains, which is made possible by new digital technologies such as automation and ' 5G' (note: this contributes to the trend away from trade globalization).431 Growth in the 3D-printing market (see ' Additive manufacturing ') also facilitates this, by allowing for what's called 're-shoring' or 'near-shoring' of production - where manufacturing Economy EconomySociety Economy Politics Science Where to from here? Technology Environment Economy Forewordcan be performed on demand and much closer to the end user.432 While this may decrease the need for long-distance transport, it will not eliminate it and thus the long-distance transport sector is also evolving in the face of new technologies and the imperative to reduce carbon emissions. For example, driverless freight using autonomous trucks may become a reality in the next 10 to 15 years, improving delivery times, and reducing traffic congestion, operating costs and accidents.433 Meanwhile, in shipping, many companies are exploring low- carbon fuels, renewable energy, and new ship designs (e.g. hulls and propellors) to increase efficiency and reduce carbon footprints.434 These kinds of changes are also propelled by an increasing customer demand for more sustainable production and more customized products (see 'Consumption').

The sharing economy is expected to grow significantly over the next ten years (with a predicted 35% growth per year in Europe)441 and this growth is driven by societal and environmental trends such as ' Urbanization ', consumer demand for 'Sustainable production ' and ' Consumption', and ' Natural resource scarcity '.442,443 440.

Digital currencies include cryptocurrencies, virtual currencies and central bank digital currencies (CBDC). Today, the most popular digital currencies are cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which use ' Blockchain ' technology to verify transactions (in a very energy-intensive manner).444 However, it is predicted that digital currencies will gain wider acceptance over the next 20 years as more central banks begin to issue them to supplement or replace fiat (physical) currencies.445 Developing countries, particularly in Africa, have already shown a huge interest in digital currencies, driven by the high use of mobile-banking services and young consumers. Nigeria launched Africa's first CBDC, the eNaira, in October 2021.446 China, South Africa and Sweden are amongst 14 countries piloting a CBDC and, as of January 2022, 87 countries (making up over 90% of global GDP) are exploring a CDBC (up from only 35 countries in May 2020).447 Economy EconomySociety Economy Politics Science Where to from here?

Technology Environment Foreword Economy Multipolarity | Decline of multilateralism | Regionalization As the world moves towards multipolarity, some predict a decline of multilateralism as international coordination becomes more difficult. Others see multipolarity as a potential driver of increased interstate cooperation, forcing countries to form alliances to counteract fragmentation. In either case, regional alliances are likely to become stronger and the regionalization that is already evident in trade statistics will probably continue. Multipolarity It is likely that, in the next 20 years, there will be no single state that can dominate all regions of the world or all domains of influence. The relative power of countries such as China and India is increasing with respect to existing powers such as Europe, the US and Russia. Alongside these, emerging powers such as Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Turkey and Vietnam, will also increasingly exert their influence at a regional and global level.450 The nature of the relationships between these countries will be key to determining the kind of international order that will emerge - if ideological differences and divisions over models of governance grow, then this could foster competition instead of cooperation and \"the intensity of competition for global influence is likely to reach its highest level since the Cold Wa r \".451 But this global influence will not be decided primarily by military and economic power, but by trade flows, aid and technology transfers, plus the number and quality of bilateral relationships.452 What this multipolarity means for global governance is not yet clear (see 'Decline of multilateralism '). 450.

But these institutions may no longer be fit for purpose in a multipolar world and there are already serious signs of weaknesses in the system (as demonstrated by the response to the COVID-19 pandemic).453 As global power becomes more diffused, it may become even more difficult to reach agreement between countries within international institutions such as the United Nations. As a result, the universalist approach to international law and human rights could be challenged - \"with competing local and regional understandings of international norms likely to prevail\" .454 If international institutions are weakened or even collapse, responses to global challenges such as climate change, poverty or technology governance will become more uncertain.455 The rise in nationalism, protectionism and populism in some countries has been linked to this sense of increased uncertainty about multipolarity and its effects on multilateralism.456 453.

The majority of countries may continue to see value in international institutions and, even if their reform is challenging, these institutions could continue to exist and remain influential.457 Regionalization If globalization has slowed or stalled, then it has arguably been replaced by regionalization - countries are trading more and becoming more interdependent with those in geographical proximity to them.458 Regional alliances are forming out of economic pragmatism, to strengthen security, and to increase regional resilience to global shocks or crises.459 However, there is a risk that as integration within regions increases, divisions between regions could grow, especially if nationalism continues to flourish and leads to more protectionist policies.460 457.

Over the last 50 years, this field has developed rapidly because of advances in genetic engineering that allow scientists to make changes to organisms' DNA. New methods of genetic modification have led to rapid advances in gene editing and testing and have also become much more targeted, quicker, and cheaper. According to the US National Intelligence Council, \"biotechnologies are at an inflection point [...] turning science fiction into reality.\"461 Within the broad category of biotechnology, there are many emerging developments that are mentioned below (and many, many more that we do not have space to cover). Although it lies at the crossroads between the categories of science and technology, biotechnology is included in the 'Science' category here because its foundations are in scientific research and experimentation - and it overlaps with many other scientific fields such as molecular biology, biochemistry, and genomics. Nevertheless, a lot of the developments mentioned here have strong links to other trends in the technology category (e.g. ' Artificial intelligence '). While international standardization is no stranger to the field of biotechnology (ISO/TC 276, Biotechnology, was created back in 2013), the pace of development in this field and the breadth of its applications means that this is an area to watch for emerging-market needs. 461.

Technologies such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) have transformed this field, by enabling extensive genome editing and allowing scientists to precisely edit DNA using a bacterial enzyme.462 Gene editing could lead to significant improvements in human health and medicine by eliminating hereditary diseases (by modifying or replacing illness-causing genes), providing more effective and targeted treatments for diseases such as cancer, and eliminating causes of disease (e.g. malarial carrying mosquitoes).463,464 As gene editing technologies become faster and cheaper, they will foster the shift towards personalized medicine.465 They could even allow the transplant of animal organs into humans - in October 2021, a significant step was made towards animal-to-human transplants as surgeons in the US tested the transplant of a genetically modified pig kidney on a deceased recipient.466,467 Applying biotechnology such as gene editing to food production has the potential to significantly increase the sustainability of food production by boosting agricultural yields while reducing land and water use, increasing the nutritional content of food, and increasing crop 462. 2021 Tech trends report.

Technology Environment Foreword Economy Synthetic Biology Synthetic biology refers to the use of certain tools and approaches within biotechnology to create new biological parts or systems, for a specific purpose. These tools may include gene editing and there is certainly overlap and blurred lines between these two trends. However, the scale of DNA changes introduced in synthetic biology is generally larger, and synthetic biology also incorporates the fields of engineering, design, and computer science. A consensus definition drafted by a group of European experts defined synthetic biology as follows: Synthetic biology is the engineering of biology: the synthesis of complex, biologically based (or inspired) systems, which display functions that do not exist in nature. This engineering perspective may be applied at all levels of the hierarchy of biological structures from individual molecules to whole cells, tissues, and organisms. In essence, synthetic biology will enable the design of biological systems in a rational and systematic way.472 The emerging global market for synthetic biology was estimated to be worth USD 11 billion in 2018 and to grow by 24% by 2025.473 Several notable trends in synthetic biology include474: mRNA vaccines: Instead of using bits of a live or dead virus, these vaccines introduce mRNA molecules that cause the body's own cells to produce a protein, which then elicits an immune response. The mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 approved in December 2020 (Pfizer and Moderna) were the first ever mRNA vaccines to be marketed. In addition this type of vaccine has huge promise because it is quicker to design and test and can be made synthetically, without cultured cell-lines. 472. Synthetic Biology.

Technology Environment Foreword Economy Organoids and organs-on-chips: Organoids are tiny in vitro organs grown from human stem-cells. These allow scientists to study how human tissue responds to drugs, viruses, and other stimuli in vitro. Organs-on-chips (or micro-physiological systems) are used for the same purpose but are engineered systems where cells from organs are grown on a chip (instead of in culture), which allows for a much more precise control of the cells and their micro-environment. This can lead to the development of much more advanced in vitro models of human systems. DNA memory: In 2018, scientists discovered how to create random access memory (RAM) on DNA at scale. In 2020, Chinese scientists at Tianjin University stored 445 kB of data in a cell on the E. coli bacterium. Current magnetic or optical data-storage systems require huge amounts of space and energy. Using DNA as a medium for storing data could potentially solve future data-storage problems, as DNA data storage is durable and hundreds of terabytes of capacity could be stored in a pill-sized container.

Technology Environment Economy ForewordThe purpose of this report is to get you thinking about the trends that will shape the future. We have provided a high-level overview of how the world is changing and how the future is emerging, linking this to the work currently underway in ISO's technical committees. The trends we have covered are diverse, and yet, the number of interlinkages between them demonstrates that they are all connected. What is clear is that we cannot understand the future by thinking in silos; it is the interactions between these drivers of change that will shape the world in the years to come and that will provide both challenges and opportunities for standardization.The future doesn't stand still: Continuation of environmental scanning Because the trends presented in this report are high-level and long-term driving forces, they do have some degree of longevity. But they are nevertheless in continual evolution and will no doubt interact in unpredictable ways, leading to changing trajectories. The environmental scanning phase of the ISO Foresight Framework therefore does not end with this report. The ISO/CS R&I Unit will continue to review new trend reports and analyze as they are published, with a view to updating this trend report and publishing a new edition, as necessary.ISO Standardization Foresight Framework | Trend Report 2022 Where to from here?
