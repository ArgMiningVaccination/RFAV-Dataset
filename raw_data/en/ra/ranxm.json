A system of health care that utilizes education, natural medicines, and natural therapies to support and stimulate a patient's intrinsic self -healing processes and prevents, diagnoses, and treats human health conditions, injuries, and pain. How are Naturopathic Physicians (NDs) Licensed in Vermont? There are 5 accredited schools of naturopathic medicine in the US and 2 in Canada. Naturopathic physicians were recognized as primary care providers (PCP) in 2009. (18 V.S.A. \u00a7704) There are 355 NDs licensed in VT, and 88 NDs with a VT address. (VT licensing data, 2020) 81% participate in Medicaid. (2016 Medicaid data) 25 states currently offer licensure or registration to naturopathic physicians. (Fig. 1) Vermont, Arizona and Washington permit fullprescriptive authority for licensed NDs.Naturopathic Medicine in Vermont's Healthcare System: A Thematic Analysis of Medicine at The University of Vermont, 2UVM Office of Primary Care and AHEC Program BACKGROUND OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of naturopathic physicians in Vermont's healthcare system1.To what extent are NDs practicing as PCPs vs.specialists? 2.Would a residency program influence patients' and healthcare providers' views of NPs? 3.If we expand the scope of this study to include other regions in the US, how might the role of NPs as PCPs change, if at all? 4.Given the widespread physician shortage, should naturopaths have a larger role in primary care delivery and increasing access to care? 5.Should Naturopaths be included in Medicare? How would this affect the healthcare landscape in terms of access to care? Limitations Small sample size may not be representative of ND practice across VT. Lack of ND on the research team may bias thematic analysis. NDs in VT practice within different models of care from primary care to specialty care, and some are fully integrated into allopathic practice. NDs are afforded access to the same prescribing formulary as allopathic/osteopathic physicians NDs face healthcare policy issues that interrupt continuity of care Future Directions Systematic survey of all NDs in VT Claims analysis: Summarize clinical activity based on billing/utilization data in the VT all -payer claims dataset Patient perspective regarding naturopathic medicineMETHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION CONCLUSIONS & NEXT STEPS Supported by UVM Office of Primary Care and AHEC Scholars Program; HRSA U77HP03624Figure 1: Map of ND Regulation in the United States (The American Association of Naturopathic Physicians, February 2020)Interview Process Three NDs from practices in Chittenden County, (two independent practices, one community health center). Interview guide developed by the research team. Inquiry focused on education and training, and the practicalities of naturopathic practice in Vermont.QUALITATIVE THEMES & QUOTES FROM VT NDs Scope of Practice Collaboration & Consultation Education & Training ND's treat many of the same conditions as allopathic (MD) and osteopathic (DO) physicians, (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, anxiety and depression, musculoskeletal disorders, and irritable bowel syndrome). They may have specific areas of focus or expertise. ND's perform procedures such as suturing, skin biopsies, joint and trigger point injection, and therapeutic ultrasound. Insurance \"I have a foot in the worlds of both alternative and conventional medicine.\" \"I see all the normal primary care conditions.\" \"Vermont allows me to be a PCP, bill insurance, and practice as I'm trained.\" NDs collaborate with MDs/DOs and may be fully integrated as a member of the care team in allopathic primary care practice. NDs may provide primary care or specialty/consultative services.\"I co-manage patients with both allopathic and osteopathic physicians, which includes sending and receiving referrals, exchanging notes, and calling with questions. I interact with virtually every single specialty.\" \"About 75% of my patients have a conventional PCP [of record], but they see me exclusively; the other is more of a formality.\" ND clinical training takes place primarily in outpatient primary care practices. Residency programs are available, but they areunderdeveloped and unfunded . ND degree programs are four years in duration; residencies consist of a one -year apprenticeship with a licensed naturopathic doctor. Currently, naturopathic medicine is NOT covered by Medicare, which is a significant obstacle for the continuity of care of ND patients. In Vermont, naturopathic medicine IScovered by Medicaid and many private insurance companies.\"I believe that every graduate should complete a residency program, but there isn't enough funding.\" \"About 95% of my practice is insurance based and the rest pay out of pocket.\"\"[Lack of Medicare coverage] essentially means that patients lose their doctors at age 65.\"\"Specialty societies are beginning to develop for NDs, which will present opportunities to receive extra training in specialized care.\" ANALYSIS: Thematic analysis by four reviewers to reach consensus; subsequent discussion with the entire research team.
