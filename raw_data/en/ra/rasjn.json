In our office, we take away that burden by offering a unique way to triage what is happening inside your body in order and immediately manage the symptoms you are experiencing. Clinical \"Quick Intake\" Homeopathy Homeopathic intake with us are only 90 minutes long! If you are completely new to homeopathy, a brief and over-generalized definition is: a potentiated dilution (potency) of medicine made from animals, plants or minerals and prescribed on the basis of symptom similarity... that is to say that a substance, which causes a certain set of symptoms when exposed to in toxic doses, can be used in dilution to treat the same set of symptoms when caused by something else. In other words, the medicine that best fits the symptom picture is the medicine chosen to treat the patient. Example: patient has area of skin that is red, swollen and itchy (just like a bee sting but the person has not been stung by a bee). In this case the bee sting remedy (called Apis) would be used to treat the itchy red patch of skin even through it is not a hive or a result of being stung. How is Clinical Homeopathy different from Classical Homeopathy? The practitioner using Classical Homeopathy is trying to learn your whole life's pattern in one sitting, which is why the initial appointment tend to last for three or more hours. Embarking on this therapy is like beginning traditional \"talk\" therapy, it is a commitment and requires you to be willing to connect with your thoughts and emotions in ways many people are rarely interested. On the other hand, Clinical Homeopathy is only interested in why you have shown up in the clinic today. In other words, we are only interested in managing the immediate symptoms that are distressing you or are causing you issues at the present time. As long as you can tell us how it started, When it started and exactly how it feels we can prescribe a medicine for you in as little as 30 to 45 minutes. A follow up visit will be required a week or so later and that should be the end of the acute care. If you are dealing with a more chronic problem then another follow up visit approximately a month after the first visit may also be required to make sure the chronic issue is being well managed and resolving according to expectations. Are Homeopathic medicines safe? Homeopathic medicines are prepared by strict FDA guidelines and are one of the safest forms of medicine because there are no side effects, no interactions with food, supplements or other prescribed medications and no unwanted reaction to the homeopathic medicine itself. In fact, homeopathic medicines are ideal even for infants and pregnant women. How are Homeopathic medicines taken? Homeopathic medicines come in several forms, but the most common is small, round pellets. The pellets are dissolved under the tongue and can be taken acutely for stand alone issues, daily as a support for a long-standing problem or as a single dose to jump-start the system. Currently, there are over 3000 homeopathic medicines available for use. Why choose Homeopathy?
