We are a full-service veterinary practice that incorporates all styles and modes of medicine, and we research and implement whatever it takes to get your pet healthy, happy, and hanging out with you again. While we offer a great variety of services, what is more important is the style and grace in which we practice. Does your pet always need every diagnostic and every treatment? Do you have to do it all right now? At PAZ, we spend time and work hard to understand you and your loved one. This way, we can recommend the best course of action for you and your pet. The difference? You'll never feel pressured, intimidated, confused, or guilty. We're on your team, and you'll feel it. Vaccines & Preventatives Vaccines are a hot button topic in many medical circles. You can find a handful of doctors from either camp: vaccinate for everything or don't vaccinate at all. As with most things in life, there is a happy medium between these two camps, and with proper risk assessment we can find exactly what fits your pet's needs best. All of our Rabies vaccines are Thimeserol free, which means they are free of any hard metals added to the vaccine. The core vaccines we choose for dogs are for Distemper and Parvo, without additional flu types that are typically not effective. We do this to target the issues that most dogs face and leave the antigens out that are not necessary in all cases. If your furry friend needs additional protection, we have separate vaccines which can supplement the core vaccines. Our feline vaccines are of the \"PureVax\" brand. These are longer lasting, safer, and cause fewer reactions. What to vaccinate for is a more complicated conversation than you might have thought, but by thoroughly explaining and educating you, we empower you to make easy, educated and safe decisions for your pet's health. In order to prevent illness or catch it early on, we recommend annual wellness visits for dogs and cats of all ages and breeds. There are numerous diagnostics and preventatives that we'll discuss at your annual exams, and we'll make sure they make sense for you and your pet. We want to ensure your beloved pets live the healthiest and longest lives possible! Internal medicine PAZ approaches each pet as an individual as opposed to a sub-category mentioned in a scientific paper. Two pets with the identical disease come with different health histories, genetics, and environments. No two pets heal the same way, and we acknowledge this. Comprehensive exams and evaluations are priority and they are complemented with the best diagnostic tests and procedures. Whether it's an endocrine disease (like diabetes, thyroid imbalance, Cushing's, or Addison's) or a mysterious infectious disease, it is our mission to help you find the answers and work to provide you and your pet with the appropriate treatment. Herbals & Acupuncture Herbals Have you ever wondered where drugs come from in the first place? Most pharmaceuticals were developed based on \"natural\" treatments already in place (and in some cases, around for thousands of years!). If an herbal approach is likely to be effective and reduce the risk of potential side-effects, we will work to help you identify the best time to initiate this form of therapy. As with any \"drug\" (defined as a \"medicine\" or other substance which has a physiologic effect when ingested or otherwise introduced into the body) you must always understand the risks and side effects, although they are generally minimal with herbals. Acupuncture Acupuncture stimulates the body's own pain relieving and anti-inflammatory response. It relaxes muscles, helping to relieve both local and generalized pain. It also improves blood flow and oxygenation, and even helps remove metabolic toxins. Unlike medications, acupuncture doesn't put your pet's internal organs at risk of adverse side effects. If your pet needs medications or supplements, feel at ease knowing acupuncture won't interfere with them or create adverse effects. Please contact our East and South locations to schedule with our staff TCVM DVMs. There are many benefits of acupuncture and we can help you decide if it's right for your pet. Animal Well-Being & Psychology Most clients have never had an opportunity to be educated on animal wellness and how maintaining good mental happiness translates to a happy and more fit pet. Whether it's an indoor Maine Coon or an Aussie Shepherd that has no Cattle to corral, understanding your pet's needs is vital in helping your pet thrive and be happy in your home. Does Sparky sing the song of his people the entire time you aren't home? Does Snickers pee on your bed sometimes? What if Fluffy is a bit too wound up about seeing other dogs? If your pet needs more assistance with their mental health, we offer specialized behavior services with a residency-trained doctor. Dr. Sirois uses a holistic approach to manage and treat emotional concerns of all kinds and in all pets. Head on over to our [Behavior FAQs](https://pazvet.com/about/frequently-asked-questions/#behavior) to learn more and see if this is a good fit for your pet! Dermatology Austin is the bomb, but we are known for more than one allergen in these parts. Whether its flea allergies, pemphigus foliaceus, or a nasty skin infection picked up from the greenbelt, we will be here to spot it, treat it, and have your baby ready to head back out to Zilker without the embarrassing itch. Radiology & Ultrasound We have the latest technology in digital X-ray, making the procedure faster, more accurate, and easy to share for consultation with other radiologists world-wide. We also offer dental radiology so we can provide the most thorough dental care. All our doctors are also trained on body scanning and tumor detection with ultrasonography. This is an added benefit to our senior pet screens in an effort to detect anything irregular, both inside and out! Dentals & Surgery All our doctors are skilled and confident surgeons, capable of performing all common procedures in general practice. We can help with tumor removal, laceration repair, spay and neuter, as well as dental cleanings and extractions. For very complicated surgical cases, rest assured that Dr. Tim Julien, our very own Chief Medical Officer, or our partnered mobile surgeons, will take great care of your pet.
