It is a federally recognized form of medicine regulated by the FDA. Homeopathy can help strengthen the body to fight short-term illness such as colds, flus, earache, sore throats, and more. With the help of a professionally trained homeopath, it can assist those suffering from chronic conditions like asthma, depression, autism, arthritis, and many other chronic illnesses. Homeopathic remedies are environmentally friendly, cruelty free, and derived from natural sources. Affordable, over-the-counter remedies are available at natural food stores, homeopathic pharmacies, online retailers, and even some traditional grocery stores and pharmacies. Homeopathy differs from conventional medicine in several ways including how symptoms are defined, how \"medicines\" are chosen, how much \"medicine\" is given, and cost. First, homeopathy regards symptoms as the body's healthy attempt to restore itself to balance. Therefore, a homeopathic practitioner chooses a remedy that supports, not suppresses, symptoms. Why is this? Homeopathy is based on a rule of nature called the Law of Similars. This \"like cures like\" Law states that a substance that can cause a \"sickness\" in a healthy person can help restore health to a person suffering with a similar \"sickness\". For instance, when you peel an onion, your eyes burn, itch, and water. You might also have sneezing and runny nose. During a cold or allergy attack, Allium cepa, a homeopathic remedy derived from red onion, can help your body heal itself from runny nose, watery eyes, and sneezing. Conventional medicine uses antihistamines to dry up (suppress) runny nose and watery eyes, and the medication often causes drowsiness and constipation. Second, homeopathy recognizes that each person exhibits \"sickness\" in a unique and slightly different way. That is why two people with the same illness will not necessarily receive the same homeopathic remedy. A homeopathic practitioner chooses a remedy that matches the unique symptom profile of the individual. For example, a person with upset stomach who is chilly and not thirsty would receive a different remedy than someone with upset stomach who is hot, sweaty, and craves water. This practice is known as Totality of Symptoms, an important homeopathy guiding principle. Conventional medicine prescribes treatments based on a diagnosis. Next, in homeopathy, a person takes just enough of a homeopathic remedy to stimulate their body's healing response. When this occurs, the person stops taking the remedy, and the body will continue to heal itself. This homeopathy guiding principle is known as Minimum Dose. Conventional medicine seeks to control illness through the continued and regular use of medications; if the medicine is withdrawn, the person's symptoms may return. Finally, homeopathic remedies are less expensive than conventional medicines, costing on average $8-$10 for a bottle that contains multiple doses. Sometimes only a single dose of a remedy is needed to help the body restore health. Remedies have an extended shelf life, and each may be used for several different conditions. Although homeopathic remedies are derived from natural substances, homeopathy should not be confused with other natural healing modalities like herbalism or Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Homeopathy is a unique therapeutic healing system, and the word homeopathy is not an umbrella term that includes other natural therapies. The Law of Similars has been documented since at least the time of Hippocrates (ca. 400 B.C.), but Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), a German doctor and chemist, is credited with founding homeopathy. Dr. Hahnemann observed the Law of Similars in action by testing small doses of substances on himself. By 1900, about twenty percent of doctors in the United States were homeopaths. However, due to various political and social changes, homeopathy became relatively unknown in the US until more recently. There is wider acceptance of homeopathy in such countries as France, Germany, Mexico, Argentina, India, and Great Britain. In fact, the family doctor to England's Queen Elizabeth is a homeopathic physician. The World Health Organization estimates that homeopathy is currently used by over 500 million people worldwide. At the core of nearly all of the definitions for \"classical\" homeopathy over the past 200 years are the following guiding principles: - The Law of Similars: This \"like cures like\" Law in nature states that a substance that can cause a \"sickness\" in a healthy person can help restore health to a person suffering with a similar \"sickness\". - Minimum Dose: In homeopathy, a person takes just enough of a homeopathic remedy to stimulate their body's own healing response. - Totality of Symptoms: Homeopathy recognizes that each person exhibits \"sickness\" in a unique and slightly different way. A homeopathic practitioner chooses a remedy that matches the unique symptom profile of the individual. - Single Remedy: Only one remedy is given at a time. Combination remedies are homeopathic products that combine several different homeopathic remedies. Each remedy in the combination is known to support the body as it heals through certain conditions. For example, a combination product for earaches might contain the five most frequently used homeopathic remedies for earaches. The hope is that the combination remedy will contain the remedy needed by an individual with that condition. These combination remedies are often used for simple acute conditions; however, their use does not constitute classical homeopathy. Homeopathic medicines are considered drugs under U.S. federal law, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates the manufacture, marketing, and sale of all homeopathic remedies. Homeopathic remedies are made by homeopathic pharmacies according to standards and processes outlined in the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States (HPUS), the official US homeopathic remedy manufacturing manual. The HPUS contains information necessary for proper identification of raw materials, techniques for remedy manufacture, and quality control measures. Homeopathic remedies are FDA-regulated, non-drowsy, non-habit-forming, and non-toxic. Homeopathic medicines have been used for more than 200 years and have established a remarkable safety record over that time. Homeopathic medicines offer some of the safest choices for self-treatment. Homeopathic medicines above 8x or 4C have a very low risk of side effects and no contraindications. The labeling of any lower attenuation products that might have concerns will provide appropriate warnings. Some homeopathic products are restricted to sale on a prescription basis to ensure they are used properly to obviate any problems. Additionally, some products are labeled for external use only. They can be safely taken with other conventional medications and are sometimes recommended to complement other treatments. As with all Over the Counter (OTC) medicines, if you are pregnant or nursing, you should check with your health care practitioner before using any medicines. Homeopathic medicines have a remarkable safety record, but this is a special time in your life when you will want a professional's judgment regarding what you expose you and your little one to. Several books have been written by qualified professionals on the proper use of homeopathy for babies and children. Homeopathy is very safe to use with animals. As with people, many can learn to use homeopathy at home to help their pets with simple conditions, but chronic and serious illnesses require consulting a trained homeopath with experience with animals. Working with a veterinarian who is familiar with homeopathic medicines, animals of all sizes can be helped, especially if the owner has made a careful assessment of the symptoms to assist the vet in choosing the right remedy. Most over-the-counter homeopathic remedies are available at natural food stores, organic markets, homeopathic pharmacies and manufacturers, online retailers, and even some traditional grocery stores and pharmacies. Many in the community mail order their remedies from the manufacturers directly.
