While integrative medicine has been referred to as the [\"new\" medicine](http://www.bravewell.org/integrative_medicine/new_medicine/), it is in many ways a return to principles of medicine from the time of Hippocrates: a focus on science-based practices while acknowledging the body's natural healing capacity. By combining conventional Western medicine with time-tested, proven practices from around the world, we expand our care options for a variety of conditions and diseases. By remembering the core principles of healing and the need to care for the whole patient, we can better relieve suffering. | | News and Events In-Person and Telehealth Visits* The following services can be scheduled currently for In-Person care: The following services can be scheduled for Telehealth Visits only*: For other questions about scheduling please call 312.926.3627 or send your provider a MyNM Patient Portal message directly.

Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine, or DOs, are fully licensed physicians who practice in all areas of medicine. DOs receive special training in the musculoskeletal system during medical school and use their hands to diagnose and treat illness and injury. Osteopathic physicians focus on prevention, tuning into how a patient's lifestyle and environment can impact their wellbeing. A typical office visit includes a normal history, physical, and treatment plan. DOs practice according to the latest science and technology, but also consider options to complement pharmaceuticals and surgery. The treatment plan may include Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT) in addition to medications, lab work, imaging, referrals etc. What is OMT? Osteopathic manipulative treatment- hands-on procedures that identify and treat painful structural abnormalities in the body, promote healing and increase overall mobility. OMT can be used with people of all ages. OMT is often used to treat muscle pain, but can also help provide relief for patients with asthma, sinus disorders, carpal tunnel syndrome, plantar fasciitis, headaches, chronic pain and more. OMT can be used to complement, and sometimes even replace medications or surgery. What is Neuromusculoskeletal Medicine? Neuromusculoskeletal medicine is a specialty in osteopathic medicine that diagnoses and treats conditions involving nerves, muscles, soft tissue and bones. The goal of this type of medicine is to help the body heal itself. The fellowship and board certification distinguishes physicians who regularly practice OMT and have at least one year of additional training in OMT.
