The dependable parts of life - even the most mundane tasks - give you a reason to get up and going every morning. In their own ways, they are the rituals of your life. Some are simple yet important, like washing your hair, and any task can be elevated when you switch from mindful repetition to mindfulness. Cooking meals becomes more meaningful when you think about the nourishment it provides, from farm to table, and the joy it can give you and others. Finding spiritual resonance in your rituals can enrich your life and help you thrive. Understanding Rituals Every day, we practice rituals - we brush our teeth, eat breakfast, watch a favorite show. We do them with ease and often without much thought. Spiritual rituals hold more meaning - they resonate with us - and it can be important for spiritual health and overall happiness to engage in some on a regular basis. \"They allow us to step into the sacred,\" says Canyon Ranch Director of Spiritual Wellness Stephanie Ludwig, PHD, MA, MDiv. Even simple rituals can be made spiritual through an intention to bring love and awareness to them. The meaning and repetition you bring to it remind you that it's sacred. What can become a spiritual ritual may surprise you - and may be something you're already doing. \"Whatever it is, you're bringing consciousness to it, which allows you to turn inward and reflect,\" Ludwig says. These rituals can be personally meaningful, whether performed alone or with others. Ludwig shares some of her favorite suggestions for incorporating a spiritual ritual into your life: Enjoy a Hobby \"Explore your creativity as a spiritual ritual,\" advises Ludwig. Expressive dance, poetry, drawing, writing, singing \u2014 even cooking and gardening \u2014 are all examples of activities that can provide a deeper experience. \"Hobbies are personal, and when you make time for an activity that means something to you, it feeds your spirit.\" Connect with Others Calling a friend or family member each week, or connecting monthly with a group of friends who are uplifting to you, can be a ritual that becomes sacred and nourishes your spirit. The same goes for volunteering or engaging in a community group. \"It's the ritual of showing up to help someone \u2014 no matter the cause \u2014 that can be deeply fulfilling,\" says Ludwig. \"The relationships that are formed in those situations also contribute to your spiritual health.\" Exercise Though moving your body is certainly something you do for your physical health, it can also be a spiritual practice. \"Many people feel spiritually connected when they're running,\" says Ludwig. But any form of exercise \u2014 lap swimming, walking, indoor cycling \u2014 can offer you that. Often, exercise can be a vehicle to help calm and still the mind, which allows us to be in the present moment. Yoga, tai chi and qi gong are particularly helpful, as they're mind/body practices that help you find focus as you consciously move through poses and positions. Perform Affirmations \"Affirmations, whether written down or said aloud, are a daily reminder to yourself that you're moving in the direction you want to move in or that you're becoming the person you want to be,\" says Ludwig. Saying these words is a method of acknowledging that your spirit is fulfilled in certain ways and that you're continuing to achieve feelings of contentment and happiness. Try a few when you wake up or before you go to sleep, such as: I have energy and am filled with joy. I am healthy and my mind is sharp. I am blessed to have such wonderful family and friends Breathe Mindfully Taking a few minutes each day to breathe with purpose is one of the simplest rituals you can include in your life. \"Your breath is connected with your spirit,\" says Ludwig. Mindful breathing increases your awareness and brings you into the moment, allowing you to focus on you. Embrace Nature Spending time outdoors and observing your surroundings can help you feel connected to the larger world around you. Watch the sun rise or set, notice the wildlife on a hike, or listen to the wind pass through the trees as you stroll on a walking path. Just sitting outdoors and taking in all the colors, smells and sounds can provide comfort, increase your energy and mood and reduce stress. Set Your Intention \"Whether it's daily or weekly, reflecting on your intention helps you go through life with consciousness,\" says Ludwig. It allows us to think about what we want to work on and what we hope to achieve in order to maintain spiritual health. Write it down, say it out loud, tell a friend. This is also a great annual ritual to adopt \u2014 how do you want to feel fulfilled this year? Practice Gratitude & Forgiveness Keep a gratitude journal \u2014 jot down three things each day \u2014 or tell your partner or friend what you're thankful for. \"It can change the way you feel pretty quickly,\" says Ludwig. \"Particularly in times of stress or difficulty, practicing gratitude can be helpful. Focusing on the positive helps ease worry and pain, and brings forth an indescribable sense of well-being.\" Practicing forgiveness is a similar ritual. \"Take an honest assessment of what happened during the day and, if something doesn't feel right, find forgiveness so you don't carry it with you,\" Ludwig advises. These practices are great end-of-day rituals that require you to reflect internally. Pray & Meditate \"The nature of the mind is to bring us off track, which can lead to stress and lack of clarity,\" says Ludwig. \"But if you're committed to a prayer or meditation practice, even for just five minutes, you can bring yourself into balance.\" Whether you say a prayer for yourself or for someone else, it's about connecting with something larger than yourself. Relax Your Body & Mind Receiving a massage can be a wonderful self-care ritual, and can also offer you a chance to breathe mindfully, think things through and assess what you need. \"Water, for many people, is peaceful and purifying, and represents letting things go,\" says Ludwig. \"Soak in a bath or sit by a running fountain.\" Using other tools, like essential oils, candles or music, to create a personal experience can also become rituals that help you feel spiritually sound.
