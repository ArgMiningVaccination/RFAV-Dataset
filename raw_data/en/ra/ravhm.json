Indian efforts to popularise Yoga globally got a boost with June 21 being declared as the International Day of Yoga since 2015.

I can say with confidence that if today the figures of Yoga practitioners are collected all over the world, then amazing facts will be revealed to the world. Prime Minister Narendra Modi This remarkable analogy which was postulated centuries ago means by practising Yoga regularly some very good qualities are imbibed. Courage is developed from the regular practise of Yoga which protects us like a father. Yoga also helps in building the quality of forgiveness as possessed by a mother. It also helps in developing mental peace which becomes our permanent friend. Bharthari has said through regular practise of Yoga truth becomes our child, mercy our sister, self-control our brother, the earth itself becomes our bed and knowledge satiates our hunger. When so many qualities become the friend of the Yoga practitioner then he overcomes fear. And above all Yoga practise needs no financial investment. Highlighting the role of Yoga amidst the Corona pandemic Prime Minister Narendra Modi said,\" In this century we realise that Yoga has united the world. Like Yoga connects body, mind, and soul similarly today Yoga is connecting the world. The desire to be free from stress and disease and have a very happy life could be only attained through the path of Yoga.\" It strikes a balance in life through undertaking the journey to not only ensure good health for the body but also the purity of mind and thoughts. According to Yoga Guru K Pattabhi Jois, Yoga is true enlightenment, an inner cleansing. Apart from its health benefits, this ancient form of science also ties society together.People from every walk of life are now adopting Yoga which has emerged as the most trusted mean to boost physical and mental well-being. Yoga has crossed the regional boundaries to reach off-shore destinations where it is becoming very popular. Centuries ago one of the most popular Sanskrit poets Bhartrhari while highlighting the specialty of Yoga has said: S New India Samachar June 15-30, 202116 Yoga transforms our lifestyle which helps the body to adapt to natural changes. Just four months after Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister he made an effort to get international recognition for Yoga. In his address to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), he proposed the idea to adopt International Yoga Day. Amidst the Corona pandemic, many heads of the states have discussed the role of Yoga in curbing the ill-effect of Corona with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In his virtual address on the occasion of International Yoga Day last year Prime Minister Modi said, \"Yoga is all about connecting and bringing us together.\" According to him, Yoga gives a message of international brotherhood and bridges the differences. If today the power of Yoga is recognised across the globe then it has been made possible by the untiring efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. WHEN THE WORLD REALISED THE IMPORTANCE OF YOGA Due to the Narendra Modi Government's relentless efforts, June 21 was declared as the International Yoga Day by UNGA. On December 11, 2014, the 193-membered UNGA approved the proposal by consensus with a record 177 co-sponsoring countries passing the resolution to establish June 21 as \"International Day of Yoga\". In its resolution, the UNGA endorsed that \"Yoga provides a holistic approach to health and well-being apart from striking a balance between all aspects of life. The wider dissemination of information about the benefits of practising Yoga would be beneficial for the health of the world population.\" This infused an era of holistic health revolution in the country in which more attention was given to prevention rather than the cure. The main event marking the first International Yoga Day was held at Rajpath in the national capital on June 21, 2015 set two Guinness World Records. One for the largest Yoga session ever in the world which saw the participation of 35,985 Yoga enthusiasts.

In 2003 under the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Government, it was renamed AYUSH. The Narendra Modi Government created a separate AYUSH Ministry in 2014 with an aim to get global recognition for Ayurveda and Yoga. Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the initiative to popularise Yoga by sharing its importance in his address to UNGA on September 27, 2014. Soon after, the UNGA adopted the resolution with a consensus to celebrate June 21 as International Yoga Day.

It establishes coordination between the mind and body. Yoga is the confluence of art and science which guides us to live a healthy life. As per the root word yujir in Sanskrit, the term Yoga means to join or unite. It is said that Yoga practice connects our individual consciousness to universal consciousness. The origin of Yoga is considered to date back to Indus-Saraswati Valley Civilization period that is nearly 2700 BC ago. Even in the pre-Vedic period Yoga was practised. Maharishi Patanjali was the first to organize and codify the then ancient practices through his systematic treatise Yoga Sutra. He is also called the father of traditional yoga because of his immense contribution to the field. Scholars after him have also made a tremendous contribution towards the conservation and development of Yoga through documenting the Yoga practises and promoting it worldwide.

EFFORTS TO BOOST YOGA After independence efforts were made to integrate Yoga with the programmes of public health services but its pace was very slow due to which it cannot attain its rightful place. In 1976, country's first Central Yoga Research Institute (now known as Morarji Desai National Yoga Institute) was established. In 1978, Central Council for Research in Yoga and Naturopathy was established. In 2003, Indian Systems of Medicine and Homoeopathy was renamed as AYUSH department. But the real transformational journey of Yoga begins from November 9, 2014, when a separate AYUSH ministry was created. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's address at the UNGA in 2014 highlighting the importance of Yoga received wide acceptance from the international community which helped in its global proliferation. In February 2016, National Board for Promotion and Development of Yoga & Naturopathy (NBPDYN) was established with an aim to improve the quality of yoga training available to the citizens. For this purpose, professionals from AIIMS and IITs were involved. India plays a very important role in organizing various events at the global level for International Yoga Day. As the nodal ministry, the AYUSH has also released a common Yoga protocol according to which youths and senior citizens can participate in a 45 minutes programme without any hassles. Under a pilot project, ASHA workers are getting Yoga training in Pune for its promotion in rural areas.

Through regular Yoga exercises, the immunity is enhanced manifold. In various scientific studies, it has been proved beyond doubt that Yoga makes every cell of the body healthy and strong.\" Yoga can play an important role in achieving our age-old philosophy of (Universal Brotherhood). Importance Increased during COVID-19 Emphasising on the relevance of Yoga during COVID-19, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said last year that Yoga strengthens the body's immune system and prnyma must be included in one's daily life. The prnyma or breathing exercise strengthens our respiratory system. It is more relevant in the present times because it is the respiratory system of the body which is badly affected by the Coronavirus. During COVID-19, Yoga has also strengthened the family bond and infused a new positive energy into the compulsion to stay locked up in homes. Studies revealed that Yoga has played a very important role in COVID-19 management and reducing stress during lockdown. Not only this, even the medical science is acknowledging the importance of Yoga for building a healthy life. IIT Delhi had also published a research paper on it. A study conducted at AIIMS, Rishikesh, revealed that compound prnyma and diaphragmatic breathing helped glaucoma patients recover 20 per cent faster. Intensive global research on Yoga has yielded promising results in the management of psychotherapy and lifestyle disorders. Yoga has also shown promising results in problems like lower back pain and frequent stress. Yoga should be kept away from controversies. Yoga does not discriminate between the rich and poor Yoga helps in connecting with oneself. Yoga is a means of unity in society Yoga promotes employment and economy There is need to increase the number of trained Yoga instructors Yoga is aiding in development of business worth Billions and Trillions Efforts for Yoga at international level and in India are being honouredNew India Samachar June 15-30, 202126 Yoga is one of the easiest, effective, zero cost, and safe means to bring about positive changes in present-day physically inactive lifestyles. Moreover, the scientifically proven health benefits of Yoga practice are extant, varying from the enhancement of muscular strength and body flexibility, improved respiratory and cardiovascular function, recovery from addiction, reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and chronic pain, improve sleep patterns, to the enhancement of overall well-being. Given the proven potential of Yoga in the combat of complex health-related issues of worldwide concern, the popularity of Yoga has spread far beyond India, the country of its origin. According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), Yoga was documented as the most popular form of complementary therapy practiced by more than 13 million adults. In the 69th United Nations (UN) General Assembly, Yoga received its official International recognition on December 11, 2014. During the same, June 21 was proclaimed as the International Day of Yoga (IDY) by the UN, aimed at raising worldwide awareness of the benefits of practicing Yoga. The inception of IDY has also been considered as one of the major recognition of India's soft power. Though there was evident popularity of Yoga even before the inception of IDY, the massive participation of thousands of people in the annual celebrations of IDY, further steered the rising popularity of Yoga. These annual celebrations are mostly coupled with the organisation of many scientific seminars and conferences which endorse significant contributions of Yoga. On the 2nd annual celebration of IDY, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed all the yoga institutions to take up several programmes to promote yoga for diabetes. This led the local administration into a series of activities, which included the Yoga for good life conclave. An important outcome of the event was the planning and successful execution of a mega nationwide project called Niyantrita Madhumeha Bharata Abhiyan. The project aimed to provide scientific evidence that the increasing prevalence of diabetes in India could be halted through a Yoga- based lifestyle programme. Through this multicentre clinical trial, Yoga-based intervention was given to ~4000 pre-diabetes individuals, which resulted in a 64 per cent reduction in the diabetes risk over 3 months. In the same year when surveyed across the nation, 92.6 per cent of the Indian population perceived Yoga as useful practice for lifestyle modifications (92.6 per cent). Local yoga goes global Dr H R Nagendra When United Nations announced celebrating International Day of Yoga, Dr H R Nagendra was one of the members to lead the programme. Padma Shri awardee Dr Nagendra is Chancellor of the Bengaluru-based S-VYASA University. StoryDr H R NagendraNew India Samachar June 15-30, 202127 This increased positivity in perception about Yoga and its awareness in the Indian population could be linked to the International Day of Yoga. There have been extensive surveys that had assessed the motivational factors underlying Yoga practice. The most commonly cited factors were general wellness, health and fitness, a specific health condition, and improved immune function and energy. As evident from the scientific literature, there has been a concomitant increase in the popularity of yoga across western countries following 2015, particularly in the United States, Germany, Australia, and the United Kingdom. We would like to present a few key instances here to support the same. Youth is the most important age group for the future world. In the year 2018, potentially beneficial effects of Yoga on outcomes about youth education (cognition; academic performance; psychosomatic, social, and physiological measures, etc) were addressed in a Lancet report, one of the most prestigious journals. Gothe and colleagues stated Yoga as the most popular complementary health approach practiced by adults in the US in the year 2019. The statement could further be supported by a previously reported national health survey done in the US that stated a lifetime prevalence of 13.2 per cent or 31 Million adults in the year 2012. A very recent (the year 2020) and comprehensive survey done in the UK on 2434 Yoga practitioners indicated that Yoga is used in the UK to manage health conditions and support well-being and potential to support self-care of debilitating and costly health disorders. In a report from Germany in 2018, Dr Holger Cramer reported an increasing number of Yoga therapy clinical trials being conducted in the country. He also highlighted the likelihood of acceptance of Yoga therapy as an adjunct treatment approach for selected medical conditions within the German healthcare system. A large survey was done in Australian women, in the year 2017, reported an association between yoga/meditation practice and positive health behavior in Australian women (higher physical activity levels, a higher likelihood of vegetarian or vegan diet use). Further, citing the reference of IDY, and the reported benefits of Yoga on mental issues, a group of scientists from India, the UK, Nigeria, Italy, Brazil, Turkey, and New Zealand endorsed the potential of Yoga for COVID-19 related mental health issues. Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of California-San Diego, Chopra Library for Integrative Studies, and Harvard University have also shared exploration and concluded that \"certain meditation, Yoga asana (postures), and pranayama (breathing) practices may be effective adjunctive means of treating and/or preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. There has been documentation of several scientific reports on the benefits of Yoga practice during the COVID-19 imposed lockdown. Indian authors, Pooja S and colleagues reported Yoga as an effective self- management strategy to cope with stress, anxiety, and depression, and maintain wellbeing during COVID-19 lockdown. Finally, we would like to bring to the notice of the readers the IDY celebration of the year 2020. Amidst the imposition of lockdowns, strict social distancing measures across the globe due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and shutting down of yoga studios and other communal spaces, there was an online successful celebration of the 6th annual International Yoga Day. 5 5 "}
