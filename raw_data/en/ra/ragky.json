Dropwise Essentials, a green business that makes aromatherapy and organic plant-based personal care products, recently announced that it has created clean-burning aromatherapy soy candles in three of it's most popular aromatherapy blends to augment its fast-growing aromatherapeutic body care line. Dropwise decided to create soy candles as a safe, non-toxic alternative to the glut of candle products on the market today --many of which are loaded with chemical dyes and synthetic fragrances, or are made with blended waxes and leaded wicks which burn black and emit potentially harmful residues. \"Soy candles have become extremely popular in recent years for good reason,\" says Donya Fahmy, owner and formulator. \"Candles made with 100% soy wax offer significantly longer burn times, superior scent throw, and are completely biodegradeable --making splashes and spills a cinch to clean up. Our candles offer the added benefit of clean-burning cotton wicks and totally natural herbal colorants, and like all of our aromatherapy products, they're handcrafted with only pure essential oils.\" Dropwise Aromatherapy Soy Candles are currently available in three Dropwise blends. Inspiration is a heartwarming blend of orange, tangerine, grapefruit, ginger, and elemi essential oils that's perfect for taking the chill out of grey winter days and bringing on that much needed smile. Use it to improve your mood any time of the year. Revitalize is a clarifying blend of eucalyptus, rosemary, pine, lemon, and geranium essential oils that evokes fresh mountain air and refocuses the mind. Burn it along with the midnight oil for brighter results! Soothe is a lovely blend of lavender, chamomile, geranium, and clary sage essential oils that calms the mind and relieves stress and anxiety. Light it in the bedroom or next to the bath to work its magic and help promote a restful sleep. The company also offers a fourth seasonal blend called Holiday Cheer made with essential oils of sweet orange, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and fir -- a comforting and familiar scent that evokes the warmth and joy of the holiday spirit. In keeping with the company's commitment to sustainability, the candles come in 4 oz and 8 oz re-usable aluminum tins with clear view tops. The 4 oz tins have an approximate burn time of 20+ hours while the burn time for the larger 8 oz size is approximately 45 hours. Candles are available directly from https://www.dropwise.com and select retail locations.
