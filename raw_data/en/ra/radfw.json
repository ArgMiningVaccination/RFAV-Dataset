The behavioral hea lth system in Nevada is comprised of federal, state and local resources that operate under a variety of funding sources, priorities and mandates. Expenditures related to behavioral health within DHHS are separated into five categories: Director's Office, Aging and Disability Services Division (ADSD), Division of Health Care Financing and Policy (DHCFP), Division of Public and Behavioral Health (DPBH ), and Division of Child and Family Services (DCFS). In addition to providing direct services, Divisions within DHHS work with many diverse stakeholders acro ss the s tate, including family members, advocates, non-profit and public service providers, partne r agencies, legislators, law enforcement , and the public. In order to ensure that the varied needs and interests of Nevada stakeholders are reflected in the integration and decision making process , and to set priorities, DHHS sought input from multiple perspectives. The three Divisions within DHHS that provide services that can address gaps in the system of care identified in the meta -analysis include ADSD, DCFS and DPBH. Although Medicaid expenditures make up over half of all state behavioral health fund ing, the most significant primary provider for adult public behavioral health services is DPBH. In addition to Medicaid fee for service providers and managed care organizations, DCFS provides behavioral health services to children and adolescents in Washo e and Clark County, while DPBH provides services in the rural areas of the state. ADSD behavioral health funding is allocated for Youth Intensive Support Services providing intensive support services to children/youth and their families. ADSD also prov ides support services recipients who are 18 years and older and have significant medical and/or behavioral support needs. This meta -analysis is designed to support the stakeholder input process and facilitate priority -setting by providing a high -level sum mary of the recommendations submitted by over fifteen regional and statewide planning initiatives that have taken place since 2010. The most critically defined needs and gaps that have been identified for Nevada's behavioral health system through these div erse planning efforts are presented in this report . This meta -analysis summary incorporates information from multiple reports without individual attribution to each of the original document s. Rather, documents are referenced by number and cited in Appendix 6.1. INTEGRATION IMPLIES C ARING FOR THE ENTIRE PERSON , BOTH IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL OR PRIMARY HEALTH CA RE NEEDS , AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NE EDS, AS WELL AS INCLUDING MENTAL HEA LTH AND /OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE . DPBH Behavioral Health Strategic Initiatives, 2014 DHHS Behavioral Health Needs in Nevada Meta -analysis Summary 2 | Page Table 1: SAMHSA Six Strategic Initiatives This summary report also focuses on specific sub - populations that are considered priority recipients of services because of the disparity of services and access to health and behavioral health care services, when compared to the general population. Recommendations are organized by and aligned with the U nited States (US) Substance Abuse and Mental Health Ser vices Administration's (SAMHSA's) six Strategic Initiatives that address the evolving needs of the behavioral health field , specifically patient and family centered care services delivered under DHHS by ADSD, DCFS, DBPH or partner agencies in an ever -chang ing health care environment. 2 GUIDING PRINCIPLES & DIMENSIONS OF RECOVERY The core values and principles that guide the behavioral health and substance use disorder prevention and treatment services in Nevada overlap across the different systems within which these services are delivered. This overa rching philosophy of care, as articulated in multiple planning efforts, seeks to ensure that Nevada's entire system reflects a unified view of recovery and incorporates the elements essential to recovery into service delivery, advocacy, decision -making, fu nding and policy development. SAMHSA has identified four major dimensions that support a life in recovery: HEALTH HOME PURP OSE COMMUNITY Additionally, the ten guiding principles of recovery laid out below were put forth by SAMHSA a nd have been modified to encompass the values and principles reflected in Nevada's planning initiatives : 1. Recovery emerges from hope . The belief that recovery is real provides the essential and motivating message of a better future - that people can and do overcome the internal and external challenges, barriers, and obstacles that confront them. Hope is the catalyst of the recovery process. 2. Recovery is person and family -driven. Individuals and families optimize their autonomy to the greatest extent poss ible by making decisions and playing a central role in determining which services and supports will best assist their recovery and resilience. Services and supports need to be p rovided in the least restrictive, most appropriate community -based setting in order to support independence. Such services and supports allow families to remain intact and recognize that children, youth , and families thrive in the context of their homes, communities , and schools. 3. Recovery occurs via many pathways. Individuals are unique with distinct needs, strengths, preferences, goals, culture, and backgrounds , including trauma ex periences. This influence s their pathway(s) to recovery. Recovery is built on the strengths, resources, and inherent value of each individual. In some cases, recovery pathways can be enabled by creating a supportive environment. This is especially true for children, who may not have the legal or developmental capacity to set their own course. SAMHSA'S STRATEGIC INITIATIVES 1: Prevention of Substance Abuse and Mental Illness 2: Health Care and Health Systems Integration 3: Trauma and Justice via Trauma -informed Approach 4: Person -centered Planning and Recovery Supports 5: Health Information Technology 6: Workforce Development RECOVERY IS A PROCES S OF CHANGE THROUGH WHICH INDIVIDUALS IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH AND WELLNESS, LIVE A SELF -DIRECTED LIFE, AND STRIVE TO REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL . -SAMHSA's Working Definition of Recovery DHHS Behavioral Health Needs in Nevada Meta -analysis Summary 3 | Page 4. Recovery is holistic. Recovery encompasses an individual's who le life, so the array of services and supports available should be integrated, coordinated , and community -based. This means addressing: self -care, family, housing, employment, education, clinical treatment for mental disorders and substance use disorders, services and supports, primary healthcare, dental care, complementary and alternative services, faith, spirituality, creativity, social networks, transportation, and community participation. 5. Recovery i s supported by peers and allies. Peers encourage , engage , and provide each other with a vital sense of belonging , cultural support and community. Peer and family supports , combined with professional allies, provide important resources to assist people , including children with behavioral health problems a nd youth in recovery and their families , along their journeys of recovery and wellness. 6. Recovery is supported through relationship and social networks . Family members, peers, providers, faith groups, community members, and other allies who offer hope, support, and encouragement; and who also suggest strategies and resources for change , form vital support networks that lead to a greater sense of belonging, personhood, empowerment, autonomy, social inclusion, and well-being . 7. Recovery is culturally -based a nd influenced . Culture and cultural background in all of its diverse representations, including v alues, traditions, and beliefs are keys in determining a person's journey and unique pathway to recovery. Services should be culturally grounded, attuned, sen sitive, congruent, and competent, as well as personalized to meet each individual's unique needs. 8. Recovery is supported by addressing trauma . The experience of trauma is often a precursor to or associated with behavioral health issues. Services and suppor ts should be trauma -informed to foster safety (physical and emotional) and trust, as well as promote choice, empowerment, and collaboration. 9. Recovery involves individual, family, and commun ity strengths and responsibilities . Individuals, families, and communities have strengths and resources that serve as a foundation for recovery. Families have a key stake in the policies and procedures governing care for all children in their own community, state, and tribe. In order to f acilitate their full, authentic involvement, they must be given tools and opportunities to participate in the process. This includes: choosing supports, services, and providers; setting goals; designing and implementing programs; monitoring outcomes; partn ering in funding decisions; and determining the effectiveness of all efforts to promote the behavioral health and well-being of individuals, including children and youth. For every level of Nevada's behavioral health system of care, this involves: Coordin ating Across Partners Community -led Action Data -driven Achievable Strategies and Goals Making Commitments and Measuring Results Leveraging Existing and Untapped Resources Removing Barriers 10. Recovery is based on respect . System and societal acceptance and a ppreciation for people affected by behavioral health and substance use problems are crucial factors in achieving recovery. There is a need to protect their rights , eliminate discrimination , and ensure that policies and practices are designed to remove bar riers and decrease stigma. Recognizing that every family has individual cultural values which exist in the context of the community culture in which they live, services must be culturally and linguistically responsive and demonstrate respect for the values , beliefs, traditions, and customs of every person and every family. The system of care (SOC) model is an organizational philosophy and framework that involves collaboration across agencies, families, and youth for the purpose of improving services and acc ess and expanding the array of coordinated DHHS Behavioral Health Needs in Nevada Meta -analysis Summary 4 | Page community -based, culturally and linguistically competent services and supports for children and youth with a serious emotional disturbance and their families. The SOC is built upon these core values and guiding pr inciples: 1. Family driven and youth guided, with the strengths and needs of the child and family determining the types and mix of services and supports provided. 2. Community based, with the locus of services as well as system management resting wit hin a supportive, adaptive infrastructure of structures, processes, and relationships at the community level. 3. Culturally and linguistically competent, with agencies, programs, and services that reflect the cultural, racial, ethni c, and linguistic dif ferences of the populations they serve to facilitate access to and utilization of appropriate services and supports and to eliminate disparities in care. Taken together, the core values and principles lead to a framework that is being implemented across Di visions under DHHS. 3 SUMMARY OF NEEDS AND GAPS The table that follows , highlights the major needs and gaps that have been repeatedly identified in previous gaps analyse s and strategic planning efforts in Nevada (since 2010 ). A brief summary of the specific levels and types of care that are most needed in Nevada is provided. In addition to the needs/gaps identified in the following table, there are other gaps that are specific to subpopulations. These include a gap in rural Neva da for behavioral health and health services, a lack of providers (both general and specialty), lack of transportation to access services in consumer s' communities, and the lack of services available in native language , such as the lack of Spanish -speaking behavioral health professionals throughout the state. 3.1 LIMITATIONS There are several limitations that must be noted related to the meta -analysis summary . They include: Consumer -engagement \u2014Consumers participated in a variety of ways to inform the reports analyzed in this summary. Engagement occurred via interviews, focus groups and surveys. These processes, in order to be efficient, are necessarily brief and may not have captured the richness or depth of the consumer's perspective or articulated their thoughts in a manner that promotes a particular framework or evidence -base. Timing and sphere of influence \u2014While emphasizing reports and needs analysis from 2012 on, this an alysis included reports written as early as 2010. Nevada has experienced considerable economic, political and social change since then and this summary doesn't consider changes that may have already occurred to the system of care, or those changes planned or in process. It also acknowledges, but doesn't bring forward strategies related to regulation, policy or legislation that are outside the sphere of influence of the A dvisory body that will use this report to make recommendations . Terminology \u2014Initiatives and needs assessments used varied terminology in the 20 reports that were reviewed . Recommendations and strategies are provided in summary and in some cases the wording was changed when necessary to ensure consistency while retaining the original intent o f the sentence. Additional input \u2014Because planning and initiative work is dynamic in nature, additional data, input and recommendations may have been developed but not identified for inclusion in the meta -analysis summary.

The largest gaps in substance use disorder treatment services in Nevada , as noted in the DHHS June 2015 Needs Assessment , are consistently reported to be: Youth residential substance abuse treatment Adult residential substance abuse treatment Recovery Supports: Peer support Community Support: Assistance with education Communit y Support: Recovery housing Key informant interview s, focus groups and provider and consumer surveys used to develop the ADSD Integration P lan identified gaps for children and adults with developmental disabilities (DD) or intellectual disabilities (ID) or both (I/DD) including those with behavioral health concern s noting : A growing population of Nevadans will need services at a time when sufficient resources are not available to meet those needs. Access to care is oftentimes interrupted by the lack of available primary care providers, specialty providers, transportation, and community -based housing, respite and socialization options, training and employment opportunities. There was a clear indication that overall funding to meet basic and special needs is not sufficient. There is a need for a service delivery system that supports people throughout the lifespan with specific supports during times of transition. There is a lack of awareness regarding services available and a lack of clarity about how to navigate th e service delivery system. Insufficient service options identified through key informant interviews and consumer surveys include: Inpatient and outpatient treatment statewide, Services for substance abusing mentally ill consumers, Substance abuse services for all populations, Lack of youth services, Lack of affordable housing, Care management and wraparound services to help those getting better to maintain stability, and Workforce concerns related to morale, compensation, recruitment and retention. NDPBH Behavioral Health Services System Report, 2014 Update SYSTEM GAPS For purposes of planning and reporting, SAMHSA has clarified the definitions of SED and SMI. Children with SED refers to persons from birth to age 18 and adults with SMI refers to persons age 18 and over; (1) who currently meets or at any time during the past year has met criteria for a mental disorder - including within developmental and cultural contexts - as specified within a recognized diagnostic classification system (e.g., most recent editions of DSM, ICD, etc.), and (2) who displays functional impairment, as determined by a standardized measure that impedes progress towards recovery and substantially interferes with or limits the person's role or functioning in family, sch ool, employment, relationships, or community activities. DHHS Behavioral Health Needs in Nevada Meta -analysis Summary 7 | Page 4 STRATEGIC INITIATIVES & RECOMMENDATIONS Within DHHS, the approach to integrating behavioral health and substance abuse prevention and treatment services , and providing services seamlessly across t he lifespan is aligned with SAM HSA's six strategic initiatives, so the synthesis of recommendations from relevant planning initiatives , largely since 2012, has been organized in accordance with these six categories. The recommendations include the realization that many communities across Nevada experience disparities in public and behavioral health care due to issues of access, cultural barriers and fiscal constraints. POPULATIONS OF FOCUS Nevada seeks to understand who is or is not bei ng served in order to develop appropriate strategies to meet the needs of diverse populations. The priority population s related to the delivery of behavioral health services includes the following groups: Adults with Serious Mental Ill ness ( SMI) Children with Severe Emotional Disturbance (SED) and their families Pregnant Women and Women with Dependent Children (PWWDC ) Persons in need of primary substance abuse prevention (PP) Persons with or at-risk of tuberculosis who are in treatment for substance abuse (TB) Persons with or at-risk for HIV/AIDS and who are in treatment for substance use (HIV -EIS) Intravenous Drug Users (I VDU) Within each community, there are sub -populations that have behavioral health disparities rela ted to access, ut ilization, and outcomes of service. These disparities might not be experienced by the general popu lation , but are common in groups that are particularly vulnerable to disparities. These sub -populations are: At-risk and transition -age youth Individuals tha t are affected by homelessness and substance use disorders (both children and adults) Individuals with co-occurring disorders Individuals that are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning (L GBTQ ) Residents living in rural/front ier communities The needs assessments and planning reports indicate these populations have specific service needs. For example, children with serious emotional disturbance are more likely to need home and community -based services to address the Top Populations in Need of Mental Health Services (provider survey) Children with serious emotional disturbance (SED) and their families, Adults with serious mental illness (SMI), Individuals with mental and/or substance use disorder involved in the criminal orjuvenile justice systems , and Individuals with SMI or SED in rural areas. Top Populations in Need of Substance Abuse Services (provider survey) Adolescents with substance abuse and/or menta l health problems , Parents with substance use and/or mental health disorders who have dependent children , Individuals with substance abuse disorders in rural areas , Women who are pregnant and have a substance use and/or mental disorder , and Unaccompanied minor children and youth Providers wrote in other populations facing significant unmet need. Some of those included dual diagnosis, homeless individuals, Latinos, Native Americans, Veterans, LGBT, and transition -age youth. - Nevada Substance Abuse, Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Needs Assessment Report 2015 Populations Served DHHS Behavioral Health Needs in Nevada Meta -analysis Summary 8 | Page needs of both the child and family. Youth in transition are in need of assessment and service planning processes that begin long before the transition is initiated . This process would also facilitate the identification of individual strengths, talents, and skills that can lead to education and career goals .

These stakeholder groups included the rural, urban and frontier communities. Nevada's stakeholders have experienced many of the same challenges and s everal overarching themes are apparent. 1. At all levels of care a nd from multiple perspectives \u2014including consumers and families \u2014the integration of behavioral health and substance abuse prevention and treatment services is a high priority and makes economic sense. 2. While the array of behavioral health services in Nevada includes some significant assets in terms of providers, coalitions, and programming, it is very clear that the services are not able to keep up with the demand. This is about capacity as well as coord ination, and there are exciting opportunities that have been identified to increase services utilizing resources that already exist. Nonetheless, an innovative approach is needed that combines new funding with these existing resources in order to adequatel y meet the diverse and critical needs of D HHS 's target population s. 3. Planning initiatives are united in the call for Nevada's behavioral health system of care to be community -based, consumer -driven, and person/family -centered. This has serious and strong im plications for DHHS's Divisions and its partners to examine where current policy and practice needs to be overhauled in order to answer that call. 4. The demand for quality, accountability , and effective services is threaded throughout the recommendations as well as stakeholder input about system needs and gaps. These planning initiatives universally articulat e this as a priority for action, using evidence -based approaches, at both the state and community provider levels. As the state proceeds with identifyi ng priorities and completing the full integration of Nevada's behavioral health system, stakeholders are asking that DHHS maintains a focus on ensuring that recommendations are implemented in a manner that is consumer -informed, data -driven, and outcome -based. This will position Nevada to deliver state -of-the- art behavioral health and substance abuse services to those in need, guided by the core values and principles that define a high quality system of care.
