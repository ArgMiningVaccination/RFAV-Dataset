It's a nontoxic [Medicine](https://www.progressivemedicalcenter.com/functional-medicine/) form that was introduced by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann nearly 200 years ago. The term homeopathy is originated from 2 words i.e. homoios means similars and pathos means suffering. This form of medicine utilizes highly diluted pathogens or other toxic matters as remedies. Such remedies encourage healing reactions in a patient's immune system or encourage other body reactions to cure the underlying causes of diseases. Homeopathic medicines are safe as they are made of tiny quantities of tested healing substances that are mainly obtained from plants, animals, and minerals. They are consumed in small doses to make them non-toxic and safe. Unlike allopathic medicines, they will not affect digestion, will not provoke allergic reactions, will not reduce immune resistance, and will not cause any side effects. Homeopathic medicines will work properly if taken as guided by a licensed homeopath. Homeopathic medicines act fast and restore optimal health just like how [Michigan marijuana](https://www.labelbazaars.com/what-are-the-cannabis-laws-in-michigan/) can. These medicines are effective in both chronic and acute conditions, as declared by millions of homeopathic doctors and patients. Many research studies have revealed effective treatment, even for seriously ill patients. Those patients reported much improvement in their health after using homeopathic medicines. Furthermore, several clinical trials have proved homeopathy better than placebo.

Homeopathy helps address illnesses at the root level, thus improving resistance to diseases. No side effects or risk of toxicity is involved in homeopathic medicines as they are safe for everybody. Homeopathy is perfect for every life stage, including lactating and pregnant women. Homeopathy has become an effective substitute to antibiotics in contagious illnesses, bringing quick recovery and causing no harmful side effects. Viral infections can also be cured with homeopathic medicines. Additionally, homeopathic medicines are also effective for several complaints appearing in kids, such as behavioral problems. Medical conditions like eczema, warts, psoriasis, arthritis, sciatica, musculoskeletal pain, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, bursitis, gastritis, intestinal conditions, heartburn, inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, sinusitis, insomnia, depression, tonsillitis, anxiety, infertility, menstrual disorders, labor induction, lactation issues, coronary dysfunctions, breast inflammation, liver disorders, etc. can be effectively treated with homeopathy. In accidents and injuries, homeopathic treatment can provide great value. Homeopathic medicines can even assist if surgery is essential. These medicines can be provided both before and after the operation to boost healing and to counterbalance any effects of anesthesia, anxiety, and shock. Generally, patients treated with homeopathic medicines make a fast post-operative recovery in comparison to patients who have not been treated with homeopathy.
