Reiki is a gentle energy healing modality from Japan that is used world-wide in hospitals, cancer centers, and private practices to support health and promote healing. It has been shown in research trials to be better than placebo and to improve multiple variables related to physical and psychological health. Supportive Reiki energy (also described as universal life force energy - analogous to chi or prana) helps reduce stress, induce relaxation and promote balance, allowing the body's natural self-healing mechanism to kick in. This makes Reiki a natural adjunct to psychological and medical treatment or part of a healthy lifestyle. If you struggle with anxiety, depression, chronic illness or pain, Reiki can help you.
