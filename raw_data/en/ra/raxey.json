Online meditation sessions are 30 minutes long, split into two parts. The first part is silent time for meditation and the second part is for reflection & sharing. - First part: 20 minutes of silent time to practice meditation. You can meditate in silence or listen to a guided meditation on your own device. - Second part: Time for reflection and optional brief share prompted by a check in question. We invite you to try sharing if you feel comfortable doing so. We will mindfully listen and hold this space together. Can I cancel or change my subscription? You can stop your subscription from renewing or update your subscription at any point. You will receive access to more detailed instructions on how to do so when you sign up. What if I am not comfortable with silent meditation? Our intention is to create an online meditation space for people to come together. If you are not comfortable with silent meditation, you are welcome to listen to a guided meditation recording. When listening to guided meditation, ensure that it enhances, rather than distracts from your meditation experience. Can I sign up to be a facilitator?

Here, you can read about the requirements, our values, and submit your application on our website to become a Meditate Together Facilitator. Do I have to share during the reflection check in? No, it's optional to share during the second part of the meditation session. We invite you to share if you feel comfortable doing so. We will mindfully listen, without judgment, and hold this space together. You may find after becoming more experienced with meditation that sharing seems more natural. Our online community provides an accepting and supportive environment as we meditate together. Are sessions hosted on holidays? On U.S. federal holidays Mindful Leader is closed and Meditate Together is not supported. Some sessions will still be running based on the availability of the facilitator teams. Do I need to have previous experience with meditation to participate? No, our meditation sessions are open to individuals at every meditation skill level, even complete beginners. It is important to note that our meditation sessions are silent and it is not a class where we will teach you meditation exercises. If you are new to meditation, it may be valuable to take a class first or listen to a guided meditation recording for the first few sessions. Listening to a guided meditation will help you learn the practice of meditation and provide you with the resources necessary to have a successful silent meditation session. Are sessions offered on Saturdays and Sundays? Currently, Meditate Together online meditation sessions are only offered Monday through Friday. What are the benefits of meditation? Participating in our group meditations may be just what you need to improve the overall health of your mind and body. The benefits of meditation can include greater [self-awareness](https://www.mindfulleader.org/blog/21612-embodying-unbreakable-wholeness-and-well), stress relief, and a developing sense of presence. You may also experience other benefits as you begin to practice meditation every day, such as an improved quality of sleep. Attempting to be present, distraction-free, and attentive during your meditation will help you get the most from your online session. Have additional questions about meditation online?
