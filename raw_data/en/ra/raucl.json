Vol. 108, No. 2 475 THE LONG-TERM TORT: IN SEARCH OF A NEW CAUSATION FRAMEWORK FOR NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGES Sanne H. Knudsen ABSTRACT \u2014Recent scientific evidence is proving that toxic releases have long-term, unintended, and harmfu l consequences for the marine environment. Though a new paradigm is emerging in the scientific literature\u2014one demonstrating that long-term impacts from oil spills are more significant than previously thought\u2014legal scholars, regulators, and courts have yet to consider the law's ability to remedy long-term ecological harms. While scholars have exhaus tively debated causation questions related to latent injuries for toxic to rts, they have overlooked the equally important and conceptually similar causation problems of long-term damages in the natural resource context. Likewise, only a few courts have considered the standards of provi ng causation for natural resource damages. They have not considered long-term injuries. This Article provides a foundation for developing causation frameworks that respect the complexities of long-term ecological harms. Specifically, this Article uses scientific research to illustrate the causal difficulty of proving long-term ecological injuries. In doing so, it establishes the foreseeability of long-term injuries and the inadequacy of applying a traditional torts paradigm. Ul timately, this Article looks to toxic tort law and risk-of-injury cases for possible approaches to the causation challenges raised by long-term ecol ogical injuries\u2014these are challenges that, like latent toxic tort injuries, raise issues of time delay, aggregate exposure, synergistic effects, and multiple possible sources of harm.

In Prince William Sound\u2014in the wake of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill of 1989\u2014the bird carcasses lined up on oily beaches bore a striking resemblance to bodies on a battlefield. 1 In San Francisco Bay\u2014in the wake of the Cosco Busan Spill of 2007\u2014tides carried a plume of heavy fuel beneath the Golden Gate Bridge as wildlife rescue workers combed beaches to save birds, fish, invertebrates, and marine mammals.2 In the Gulf of Mexico\u2014in the wake of the BP Gulf Oil 1Body counts were high in the wake of the Exxon spill. Searchers found carcasses of 1016 sea otters, 36,309 seabirds, and 144 eagles.

As striking as the images of oil and death are in the immediate wake of oil spills, the highly visible physical impacts of the spills fade relatively quickly.

Rev. 1863, 1865. 108:475 (2014) The Long-Term Tort 479 concludes \"that even relatively small spills can have long-lasting biological effects\"?13 While scientists are only just begi nning to examine the potential for long-term impacts after recent oil spills, the science generated in the twenty-five year aftermath of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill provides some guidance. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent studying the Prince William Sound in the hopes of understanding how the marine ecosystem responds to an oil spill disaster like the Exxon spill. 14 Industry and government scientists have genera ted countless studies and data trying to make sense of a complex ecosystem.15 Through these massive efforts, a new paradigm is emerging in the scientific literature. Scientists have learned that oil spills, once thought to cause intense damage only in the weeks or months after the spills, are tenacious. The oil lingers longer than expected and in more toxic forms than expected. Long after the me dia hype has calmed and nonlocal communities have moved on with their lives, the oil continues to disrupt ecosystems through sublethal, chronic injuries. In a world where scientific ev idence is mounting, it becomes increasingly necessary to ask whether the law adequately allows recovery for long-term natural resource injuries. Theoretically, the answer is yes. Federal statutes like the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) allow government trustees to recover natural resource damages in the wake of oil spills and other toxic releases. 16 This special category of damages is recovered on beha lf of the public and must be used to restore the public resources th at were injured by the release.17 Natural 13Walsh, supra note 2. 14In the time between the March 1989 oil spill and the October 1991 natural resource damage settlement, approximately $100 million was spent to an swer two questions: what was injured by the spill, and how badly? See HUNT, supra note 1, at 193. After the se ttlement, over $178 million has been spent for research, monitoring, and general restoration efforts. See EXXON VALDEZ OIL SPILL TR.

SERVS ., EXXON VALDEZ OIL SPILL: FAQS, LINKS AND UNIQUE RESOURCES AT ARLIS 2 (2010), available at http://www.arlis.org/docs/vol2/a/EVOS_FAQs. pdf. 16See Oil Pollution Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 2706 (2006) ; Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and N O R T H W E S T E R N U N I V E R S I T Y L A W R E V I E W 480 resource damages cover a wide range of injuries, both short-term and long- term.18 Theory aside, can government trustees ever truly expect to recover damages for long-term ecological injuri es? After all, long-term injuries take time to manifest. Practically, many settlements take place before the full suite of injuries manifests.19 The long latency period also means that proving a causal link between the oil spill and the later manifested harm will be difficult. Indeed, the critical obstacle to recovering damages for long-term injury is causation. This is especially so when the interplay between exposure pathways, toxicity levels, migratory potential, intervening environmental stressors, and cascading effects is complicated. Legal scholars, practitioners, and scientists alike have recognized the difficulty of meeting traditional causat ion standards for natural resource injuries. One government attorney remark ed that \"[d]iverse risk factors, poorly understood causative mechanisms, mixtures of multiple toxic substances, latency in the manifesta tion of injuries, and a host of other factors pose impossible proof burdens for plaintiffs under traditional tort standards of causation-in-fact.\" 20 Consistent with this observation, other scholars have described the burden of proving causation in natural resource damages claims as a \"substantial technical barrier to recovery.\" 21 Likewise, scientists examining long-term impacts from oil spills readily describe 18See 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 11.14(v) (2012) (defining \"injury\" to include \"a measurable adverse change, either long- or short-term, in th e chemical or physical quality or the viability of a natural resource resulting either directly or indirectly from exposure to a discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance or exposure to a product of reactions re sulting from the discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance\"); Craig, supra note 12, at 1884 (\"[N]atural resource damages embody a legal recognition that some forms of pollution, like majo r oil spills, cause both short-term and long-term damage to species and ecosystems, that this dama ge matters to human beings as well as to the environment, and that this damage involves subs tantial economic loss, including costs related to restoration and replacement. Nevertheless, natural resource damages are notoriously difficult to assess and quantify.\"). 19See, e.g. , HUNT, supra note 1, at 179 (\"As time passed on, any connection to the spill has grown more and more faint and, certainly, mo re difficult to pinpoint and prove.\"). 20Anton P.

Certainly none have undertaken the task of surveying tort law to offer a soluti on. This Article provides the academic foundation for providing a remedy for long-term ecological injuries. This Article proceeds in four parts. Part I draws on the scientific literature to establish the need for a new causal paradigm for proving natural resource damages. Having established the foreseeability of long-term harms and the inadequacy of th e traditional tort paradigm, Part II assesses the appropriateness of adopting a new causal paradigm in light of the statutory framework, jurisprudence, and central tenets of tort law. Part III identifies the core causation ch allenges that lie at the heart of proving long-term ecological injuries. Finally, Part IV offers some solutions by surveying tort law for a pproaches to situations where latent injuries take time to manifest and are often influenced by multiple intervening stressors. The questions examined in this Article have implications for how government trustees choose to structure claims for natural resource damages. One example of how such clai ms have previously been structured is the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill. Government trustees settled the resulting claims in 1991, less than three years after the Exxon Valdez ran aground on Bligh Reef. At that time, no one thought significant amounts of oil would linger in toxic forms; no one expected that fifteen species would still be listed as unrecovered more than two decades after the spill. 23 Certainly no one anticipated that the Pacific herri ng fishery would collapse in 1993 and remain closed for eighteen of the twenty-four years following the spill, including every year since 1999.24 22Robert E. Thomas et al., Induction of DNA Exposure to Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons from the Exxon Valdez Spill, 54 M ARINE POLLUTION BULL. 726, 726 (2007); see also Harlequin Duck Study , supra note 7 (recognizing that \"subtle effects . . . may be difficult to detect in nature\"). 23EXXON VALDEZ OIL SPILL TR.

ST. THOMAS L.J. 95, 102-07 (2009) (describing collapse and circumstantial evidence linking Pacifi c Herring fishery collapse to the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill). N O R T H W E S T E R N U N I V E R S I T Y L A W R E V I E W 482 Knowing that they lacked complete information about long-term injuries, government trustees included a reopener provision in the settlement agreement for the Exxon Valdez case. The provision allowed trustees to make an additional one- time demand for then-unknown injuries sometime between 2002 and 2006. Such reopener provisions are fairly common in other natural resource damages settlements as well. 25 At first glance, reopener provisions might seem to solve the problem of timing. Not so. Even if settlements contain reopener provisions that theoretically allow for additional compensation for long-term injuries, those injuries have to be proven. In the case of Exxon, trustees have made an almost $100 million demand for additional damages under th e terms of the reopener provision. These demands have been met mainly with silence and some suggestions that Exxon will challenge the alleged long-term injuries on causation grounds. 26 In the case of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill, the BP Gulf Oil Spill, and others, trustees will have to understa nd the limits of what science can prove in the face of the legal obstacles inherent in the current natural resource damages framework. Courts are just beginning to struggle with the causal issues and standards in natural resource damages cases. Only a few have considered the issue of proving cau sation for natural resource damages. Those that have examined the issue ha ve taken a fairly cursory glance and have not considered long-term injuries or the oil spill context. This Article fully explores whether a relaxed causal standard would be appropriate and provides some guidance on how to approach the problem. Ultimately, this Article recommends adopting a lenient version of the substantial factor test (termed by so me courts as the contributing factor test), provided that courts clarify the pa rameters of the test. In particular, a meaningful and appropriate test would recognize that natural forces combine with man-made forces to create injuries. Notably, the substantial factor test should be satisfied by showing that the defendant's actions increased the risk of the injury, rather than by proving the precise biological pathway resulting in the injury. I. T HE NEED FOR A NEW CAUSAL PARADIGM Long-term injuries following oil spills are of increasing concern. Scientists studying impacts fro m large-scale oil spills like the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill have begun to observe that \"[i] n contrast to the short-term effects of crude oil spills, long-term biological impacts are more difficult to 25See HUNT, supra note 1, at 31 (noting that \"reopeners ha d become a routine part of restoration settlements\"); see also id. at 248-50 (discussing reopener).

To that end, a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences presented somewhat surprising findings that even smaller scale spills can have long-lasting biological effects. 28 One researcher remarked: \"Based on our previous understanding of the effects of oil on embryonic fish, we didn't think there was enough oil from the Cosco Busan spill to cause this much damage.\"29 Concerns about the long-term impact of the BP Gulf Oil Spill have already drawn much attention from scientists and federal agencies.30 The Marine Mammal Commission,31 with input from related federal agencies, released a statement of research need s intended to guide the assessment of the BP spill's long-term effects on the Gulf of Mexico.32 Drawing from emerging science and lessons learned as a result of the Exxon Valdez spill, the Commission anticipates that \"long-term effects are a reasonable concern for Gulf marine mammals because of the amount of oil spilled, the quantity of dispersants applied both at the surface and at the wellhead, the low recovery rates of spilled oil, uncertainty regarding the eventual disposition of both oil and dispersants, and uncertainty regarding the effects 27Thomas et al., supra note 22.

Because foreseeability is central to the proximate cause inquiry at the heart of tort liability,34 the emerging understanding of long- term impacts ought to change the approach of government trustees in formulating natural resource damages demands and in the approach of courts reviewing the viability of tho se demands. In particular, the increased foreseeability of long-term harms lends greater support to the idea that responsible actors be held liable for long-term harms. 35 Because liability in tort also turns on one's ability to prove some \"reasonable connection\" between the de fendant's act and the plaintiff's injury36 (causation-in-fact),37 this Part goes on to illustrate why ascertaining a definitive causal pathway for suspected long-term injury is as complicated as Mother Nature herself. Finally, having established the complexity of proving long-term injury as a matter of science, this Part examines why a traditional causal sta ndard is inappropriate for assessing long-term natural resource damages. A.

Because the oil was only decreasing at a rate of 0%-4% per year, it would take decades to disappear entirely.49 Short's findings rocked the scientif ic community. The lower half of the intertidal zone is a \"biologica lly-rich area where mussels, clams and other marine life are found in greatest abundance.\"50 But the fact that oil remained in this area at toxic levels raised other important questions. After all, the presence of oil does not necessarily mean that animals were exposed to the oil. Indeed, one reason th e oil lingers is the oil's location in remote areas that are not subject to much wave action or disturbance. 51 News of persistent oil raised qu estions about whether the oil was bioavailable (likely to be absorbed by a living system)52: \"[W]ere animals such as sea otters and harlequin ducks w ho feed in the intertidal [zone] . . . being chronically exposed to toxic PAH?\"53 To answer that question, researchers used biomarkers to study whether species like sea otters, harlequin ducks, and Barrow's goldeneye are still exposed to the lingering Exxon Valdez oil. 54 In particular, certain genes are expressed in vertebrates when individuals have been exposed to polycyclic hydrocarbons found in crude oil. Researchers can identify gene expression by measuring corresponding levels of enzyme production used to break down the oil. 55 Importantly, biomarkers do not indi cate whether exposure to oil has compromised the survival or health of individuals.56 Nonetheless, studies using biomarkers have confirmed that a number of vertebrates experienced persistent exposure to Exxon Valdez oil for more than a decade after the spill.57 Some of those species include harlequin ducks, Barrow's goldeneye, Sound.

Detrimental impacts can be shown by depressed population numbers, higher incidence of reproductive failure in oiled areas, or greater incidence of disease in oiled areas.63 For harlequin ducks, exposure to oil tr anslated to identifiable injury at least a decade after the spill. Consiste nt with evidence of exposure, they experienced demographic problems in oiled areas of Prince William Sound.64 Scientists concluded that \"con tinued exposure to lingering oil was likely a constraint on population recovery.\"65 Indeed, some believe that more harlequin ducks have died b ecause of chronic exposure to lingering oil than from acute injuries immediately following the spill.66 Since the weeks and months following a spill are typically perceived as the period of highest damage, 67 the harlequin duck studies underscore the significance of long-term injuries on ecosystem recovery. Like harlequin ducks, sea otters have also been unwilling participants in discovering the peril of long-term oil spill injuries. While most otter populations in Prince William Sound ha ve rebounded from the shock of oiling and spill-related poisoning in th e immediate aftermath of the spill, 58Harlequin Duck Study , supra 7, at 1143. 1139.

The northern end of Knight Island is located just thirty-five miles from where the Exxon Valdez tanker ran aground and is located directly in the path of the oil.69 Before the Exxon spill, sea otters thrived around northern Knight Island.70 As of 2000, the otter popula tion was still only about half of what it had been before the spill.71 While the population appears to have made progress towards recovery, the 2009 population was still less than 30% of the pre-spill numbers.72 The slow path to recovery is thought to be caused by continuing exposure to lingering oil: Short's studies have found lingering oil in the intertidal zones of Knight Island; biomarker studies show elevated liver enzymes in sea otters in oiled areas; sea otter behavior puts them at risk of exposure because they dig pits in the intertidal zone to search for food; and necropsies of sea otter carcasses found on northern Knight Island each spring show that mortality has been predominantly in prime-aged individuals (as opposed to th e very young or very old, which is more typical). 73 Related to the issue of how much oil remains in Prince William Sound and the bioavailability of that oil is the issue of how toxic the lingering oil is.

While weathered oil does not release toxins into the environment as read ily as freshly spilled oil does, the chemical compounds that are released from weathered oil are more toxic.75 In other words, lower doses of weathered oil are required to elicit a damaging response. 76 Still, how the toxins from weathered oil cause damage is also not as well understood. Scientists are beginning to discover that different PAH compounds released from oil operate through unique toxic pathways. 77 This means that as time elapses, toxic pathways and potential impacts from oil could fan out over the ecosystem, making it increasingly difficult to gauge the harms caused by an oil spill.78 Some long-term impacts from the Exxon spill are unrelated to lingering oil. For instance, two killer whale pods in Prince William Sound are examples of how acute injuries cause d by oil spills can have permanent and devastating consequences.79 In the case of the AB pod, a grouping of resident killer whales, thirteen me mbers died as a result of the spill, including reproducing females.80 Because many of the animals that were killed were juveniles and females, and because of whales' slow reproductive cycles, it could take decad es for the AB pod to recover, in 74RICE & CARLS , supra note 6, ch. 1; see also John P.

To be sure, the group was already facing challenges before the spill, with a population of only twenty-two.82 After the spill, however, there are only thir teen remaining individuals and the Group has lost any hope of recovery.83 This long-term harm is most accurately described as an acceleration of a previously adverse trend.84 On the whole, these trends of persistent injury decades after the Exxon spill can be understood by reviewing the latest status report released by the Exxon Valdez Trustee Council. 85 That report summarizes the recovery status of the original list of thirty-two species and resources that were injured as a result of the spill. The list is not exhaustive of species that were injured but is representative of the gr eater ecosystem's road to recovery. 86 After more than two decades, only thirteen species have recovered (or are \"very likely recovered\"). 87 Ten other species are listed as \"recovering,\"88 a notoriously ambiguous category ranging from species that are almost recovered to those that barely pass the \"not recovering\" mark. 89 Ecosystem services including commercial fishing, passive use, tourism, and subsistence have not yet recovered but are categorized as \"recovering.\" 90 Most notably, some keystone species like the Pacific herring are listed as not recovering at all.91 B. The Complicated Task of Proving Long-Term Injury The post-Exxon research regarding long-term consequences of the spill illustrates that government trustees need to take steps to capture or preserve claims for long-term injuries. Long-term injuries do exist and they exist to a greater extent and magnitude than previously understood. The growing body of literature documenting long-term injuries strengthens the demands that trustees can make for natural resource damages. The mounting scientific evidence of long-te rm injuries means that these types 81Id. at 278-79. 82Id. at 279. 83Id.

Legally, this is significant given the role that foreseeability plays in the proximate cause inquiry.92 The Exxon studies also illustrate that determining the long-term consequences of a spill is a treme ndous undertaking that requires many coordinated research studies to flesh out a potential causal pathway. Funding that kind of research effort is costly. Since the trustees settled their natural resource damages claims with Exxon in 1991, they have allocated $178 million of the settlement funds to general research and monitoring in the Prince William Sound area. 93 These expenses only slightly exceed the $176.5 million spent by state and federal trustees on injury assessment and litigation efforts in the two-and-a-half years leading up to the settlement. 94 Because long-term study of oil spills is costly, trustees may not always be able to fund the research necessary to uncover problems. The study of the Exxon spill might be the best-case scenario in terms of trustees being in the position to make demands for long-term natural resource damages. This is so because the large natural resource damages settlement came relatively quickly after the spill and supplied the necessary funds to engage in extensive a nd ongoing study of Prince William Sound. Even so, recovering for long-term injuri es is more complicated than simply funding studies and making demands. Ther e are limits to even well-funded science. Chiefly, there is the simple fact that nature is complicated. Ecosystems are dynamic, complex, and varied in time and space. 95 Unraveling the mysteries of nature makes measuring the full extent and magnitude of oil-induced injuries more an exercise in rough justice than precision mathematics. For example, the ecosystem in Prince William Sound is home to hundreds of species and many different ha bitat types, all interacting as part of a complex structure. 96 That structure, those species, and the habitats are all reacting to numerous biological, chemical, and physical processes aside from oil. Global climate conditions and weather patterns impact the cycles 92See supra text accompanying notes 34 and 35; see also DAN B. DOBBS ET AL ., THE LAW OF TORTS \u00a7 198, at 681-83 (2d ed. 2011) (explaining that proxi mate cause is the judicial tool used to cut off liability for policy reasons when the causal chain becomes too attenuated to justify imposition of liability). 93LEGACY OF AN OIL SPILL, supra note 14. 94Id. 95See, e.g. , Mark A.

A change in nutrients, for example, influences the productivity of phytoplankton, which are the food base for forage fish like the Pacific herring and sand lance. 100 Those forage fish and other planktivores are the energy bridge to higher trophic levels. They utilize the energy from nutrients and provide fatty, high-energy foods for their predators, including larger fish, mammals, and sea birds. 101 It is because of this complex structure that populations of species undergo natural variations driven by any number of these dynamic influences. The study of the Prince William Sound ecosystem beautifully illustrates that ecological complexity creates scientific challenges to recovering damages for long-term ecol ogical injuries. It demonstrates the difficulty in proving causation due to lack of baseline data, natural variability, and problems of multip le stressors and multiple sources. Consider, for instance, the problem of multiple sources. When scientific studies suggest that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are bioavailable in the Prince William Sound ecosystem, one possible explanation is that the hydrocarbons are unrelated to the Exxon spill. 102 Hydrocarbons are not exactly novel in marine coastal environments. Natural, background sources of hy drocarbons in Prince William Sound come from eroding shale and natural oil seeps along the northern coast of the Gulf of Alaska. 103 Another significant release of hydrocarbons into Prince William Sound came from fuel oil and asphalt during the 1964 earthquake. 104 Human-derived sources of oil include incremental releases from cruise liners, fishing fleets, and oil tankers. Historical industrial sites are also thought to contribute to the hydrocarbons in Prince William Sound. 105 Then there are the more diffuse sources that can hardly be pinned on any particular location or single activity\u2014hydrocarbons from 97Conceptual Model , supra note 10, at 710 (\"Climate processes also have an important role in generating the stressors of physical disturbance, disease ( e.g., viral hemorrhagic septicemia, VHS), and introduced species ( e.g., species entering the system from warmer climates in response to global climate change).\"). 104Id. 105Id. at 210. 108:475 (2014) The Long-Term Tort 493 atmospheric deposition of burning coal, forest fires, and global industrial sources.106 To deal with the problem of multip le possible sources, scientists have devised a system of hydrocarbon fingerprinting.107 The Exxon Valdez oil, for example, is a mixture of crude oils from the North Slope of Alaska and contains an identifiable chemical makeup of PAHs.108 This chemical makeup is the \"fingerprint.\" Based on the types of PAHs that characterize the fingerprint, scientists can identify an appropriate biomarker that would indicate exposure of marine species to a particular source. For example, members of the cytochrome P450 1 gene family are strongly expressed when an individual has been exposed to the larger PAHs like those found in crude oil from the North Slope. 109 This biomarker has been used to study the exposure of marine species to Exxon Valdez oil in Prince William Sound.110 Assuming that the source of oil can be determined through PAH fingerprinting, however, there is still a problem of multiple stressors. Researchers must determine whether the ecosystem is experiencing difficulty with system-wide recovery because the PAHs associated with Exxon Valdez oil are wreaking chronic, sublethal havoc. Or, is it the combined stress from multiple sources of hydrocarbons that is sending the ecosystem over the edge? Nonhyd rocarbon stressors add to the complication of identifying the principle reason for ailing populations. 111 Climate change, for instance, is warming oceans worldwide and altering sea-ice habitats in ways that have profound effects on marine species. 112 Some scientists have suggested that the changes caused in Prince William Sound due to hydrocarbon stressors pale in comparison to the natural variability of climate and other ocea nographic processes that affect ocean resources. 113 Mother Nature's alternative explan ations keep coming. In 1993, the Pacific herring fishery collapsed, and it has yet to recover.114 Before the spill, commercial herring fisheries expe rienced record numbers. After the spill, the fishery collapsed and has remained closed for fifteen of the last 106Id. at 209. 107For an explanation of Bence & W.A.

Some scientific studies suggest that the 1993 collapse of the Pacific herring fishery is related to the Exxon spill.115 A common counterexplanation is natural variability116\u2014herring populations worldwide are known to experience boom and bust cycles. The theory is that nature is simply doing what nature always does and the herring will return in time. Though attractive for its ease and optimism, this explanation does not necessarily explain why the herring popul ations in unoiled areas of Prince William Sound have rebounded since the spill while those in oiled areas continue to struggle. Even if counterexplanations were fully explored and understood, yet another possibility is that several stre ssors acting together are responsible for the harms. The combination of str essors might be greater than the sum of its parts. In this way, multiple st ressors might function synergistically to magnify harm to the ecosystem. 117 This synergistic potential of toxic stressors means that lingering Exxon Valdez oil might not generate ecologically significant impacts if it were acting alone. If synergistic models were well understood, however, scientists might find that lingering oil could be responsible for (or at least contribute to) sending an already-str essed ecosystem into decline. For example, a population already experiencing increased susceptibility to disease as a result of warming oceans might succumb to that susceptibility if added toxins further weaken immune systems. 118 Or, a population already experiencing natural die-offs might be unable to rebound from the stress of a catastrophic event (e.g., killer whales in Prince William Sound).119 As if the complexity of multiple sources, natural variability, and synergistic complications were not enough, at least three other problems are wrapped up in the detection of long-term injuries. One problem has to do with knowing when a resource is injured and the others have to do with when it has recovered. First, as a pr actical matter, long- term injuries are generally detected in the course of monitoring the recovery of injured resources. After the Exxon spill, the Trustee Council identified twenty- 115Knudsen, supra note 24. 116Ecological Significance , supra note 95, at 225-26 (attributing the sustained population loss of herring in Prince William Sound to \"lar ge natural interannual variability\"). 117Conceptual Model , supra note 10, at 703 (\"[A] population or biological process might be marginally stressed by the influence of a single st ressor.

Some scientists studying the Exxon spill, for example, lament the failur e to study the forage fish such as the sand lance.123 As described above, the forage fish are the trophic link between plankton and larger fish a nd marine mammals. Understanding the impact of the spill on keystone species like the sand lance or the Pacific herring might have gone a long way towards understanding the cascading effects of the spill to higher trophic levels like sea otters or sea lions.124 Even when species are studied, determining when an injured species has recovered is also not straightforward. Under federal regulations governing the natural resource damage assessment process, trustees are supposed to use monetary damages to \"restore\" the injured resources. 125 This means returning the ecosystem to pre-spill conditions.126 Given that ecosystems are constantly evolving and being acted upon by multiple natural and anthropogenic stressors, so me commenters have suggested that returning to a defined state is not a realistic measure of recovery. 127 The reason is that the baseline for recovery of ecosystems shifts over time.128 When ecosystem health is a moving targ et, the identification of injury by comparing present conditions to the past is not always useful. Even if ecosystems could return to baseline, that standard for recovery presumes the existence of baseline in formation. Baseline data provides a basis for comparing pre- and post-spill population trends.129 It gives clues as to natural fluctuations in the oile d and unoiled areas. It helps predict which species are doing well, which ones were stressed to start, and in general whether the ecosystem is balanced. 130 The process of narrowing down the root causes of ecological injuries would be easier if scientists had 120See 2010 U PDATE , supra note 23. 121Id. at 1. 122HUNT, supra note 1, at 162 (noting that the restoration process is biased from the start because only the resources on the original list benefit from di rect intervention, study, and restoration efforts). 123Id. at 55. define \"recovery\" as \"the return of injured natural resources and services to baseline,\" which in turn means \"the condition of the natural resources and services that would have existed had the incident not occurred.\" 15 C.F.R \u00a7 990.30 (2012). 990.30 (allowing trustees to use \"his torical data, reference data, control data, or data on incremental changes\" to establish the baseline). 130For an extensive discussion of case studies highli ghting the benefits of baseline data, see Usha Varanasi, Making Science Useful in Complex Political and Legal Arenas: A Case for Frontloading Science in Anticipation of Environmental Changes to Support Natural Resource Laws and Policies , 3 W ASH.

N O R T H W E S T E R N U N I V E R S I T Y L A W R E V I E W 496 better and more baseline data.131 Pre-spill population data, however, often does not exist.132 Gathering data is costly and there is no systematic collection of baseline data by government or industry.133 In the case of Exxon, baseline data existed for some species associated with commercial fisheries (e.g., salmon or herring) or of particular interest to the public (e.g., bald eagles or sea lions). But for many species pre-spill data was limited (e.g., cormorants ) or nonexistent (e.g., Pacific sand lance).134 In the days following the spill, scientists were left scrambling to gather what baseline data they could before oil hit the shore.135 This is no way to ascertain meaningful population trends. At least one commentator, drawing on reports from the Trustee Council, concluded that \"[t]he lack of baseline data would become, over time, the single greatest obstacle to understanding the degree of injury suffered by individual species as well as measuring their ability to bounce back.\" 136 To summarize the complexity of this situation, one might return to the point made earlier\u2014that measuring th e extent and magnitude of long-term injuries caused by enviro nmental disasters like the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill is not an exercise in precision mathematics. Multiple sources of harm, synergistic effects, natural variability, lack of baseline understanding of the ecosystem to start, and overarching system pressures like climate change all provide ready-made counterexplanations to claims of long-term injuries. C. Ruling Out a Traditional \"But-For\" Approach to Causation On the one hand, science supports the notion that long-term injuries following oil spills are foreseeable and likely to be significant. On the other hand, injuries manifest in an environment with multiple stressors and intervening forces that combine to make causal pathways indirect and often uncertain. Together, these observations challenge us to consider whether existing legal frameworks can adequate ly remedy long-term harm caused 131See Ecological Significance , supra note 95, at 222 (acknowledging that cormorants have not recovered after the Exxon spill but concluding that la ck of baseline data makes it difficult to assess whether depressed populations are a result of the spill). 132Usha Varanasi, Frontloading the Science in Anticipation of Environmental Disasters , 37 F ISHERIES 233, 233 (2012) (discussing frequent lack of \"standardized and robust baseline information available about the state of the enviro nment where the spill or storm may cause serious damage\"); see also K RISTINA ALEXANDER , CONG.

Under a traditional causal standard, the answer is almost certainly no. Notably, traditional causal standards are not the only approaches that tort law has to offer. Indeed, the complex causation problems raised by long-term natural resource damages are not new to tort law. Part II examines the myriad ways tort law has evolved and adapted to address complex causal problems, particularly in the toxic tort context. Before jumping to tort law's flexibility, howev er, it is worth considering why such flexibility is needed here. In other words, it is worth reviewing what traditional causal standards would requ ire and why such standards would be an inappropriate default for the challenges of proving long-term natural resource damages. This is particularly the case given that many courts, even when moving away from traditional causal standards, retain some of the problematic language that might otherwise be inappropriate in the natural resource damages context. At the most basic level, traditional causation requires plaintiffs to prove causation-in-fact and satisfy the limits of proximate cause. 137 Roughly speaking, causation-in-fact asks whether the alleged conduct actually caused any injury.138 This component of the causal inquiry is focused on distilling facts. Did the Exxon Valdez oil play a role in the herring fishery collapse? Answering this question will be guided by scientific inquiry. 139 Ultimately, though, the question may not be answerable through direct evidence. Rather, circumstantial evidence (such as the timing of the collapse relative to the timing of the spill) might be the only evidence available. Under traditional formulations, plaintiffs have the burden of proving that tortious conduct is a \"but-for\" cause of the alleged injury.140 In many cases, the but-for test works smoothl y and efficiently at identifying the tortious actor. In the case of oil spills like Exxon, many acute injuries are readily identifiable using the but-for t est. For example, it was not hard to ascertain that but for the Exxon Valdez running aground Bligh Reef and spilling 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound, there would not have been 871 oiled sea otter carca sses collected in the spill area in the days following the accident.141 Likewise, but for the spill the commercial 137DOBBS , supra note 92, \u00a7 198, at 183, at 614. 139Id. at 615. 140David W. Robertson, The Common Sense of Cause in Fact, 75 T EX. L. REV. 1765, 1768 (1997) (\"The most widely accepted test for making [the cause-in-fact] inquiry is the but-for test.\"); see also note 92, \u00a7 at 623 (\"Under the but-for te st, the defendant's conduct is a factual cause of the plaintiff's harm if, but-for the defendant's conduct, that harm would not have occurred.\"). 141See Sea Otters , EXXON VALDEZ OIL SPILL TRUSTEE COUNCIL , http://www.evostc.state.ak.us/ index.cfm?FA=status.seaotter (last visited Mar. 12, 2014). N O R T H W E S T E R N U N I V E R S I T Y L A W R E V I E W 498 salmon fisheries would not have been closed for the 1989 and 1990 seasons.142 In a number of cases, however, including those most likely to arise in the context of long-term natural resource injuries, the but-for test fails to hold tortious actors liable.143 In particular, where there are multiple causes capable of giving rise to a single injury , the but-for test may not be satisfied by any of the contributing causes.144 For example, one of the pods of transient killer whales (the AT-1 Group) will never recover from the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill and will slowly go extinct.145 One cause of that prognosis is the oil spill. But that is not the whole story. The pod had been suffering declines before the spill, possibly due to a diminished food base and exposure to other reproduction-inhibiting pollutants.146 In this situation, the but-for test would not identify Exxon as an actual cause of extinction. Scientists cannot say that but for the Exxon spill, the AT-1 Group would not be facing certain extinction. Scientists can only say that the Exxon spill contributed to the acceleration and certainty of that extinction. 147 In that situation, no single cause necessarily satisfies the but-for test because there are alternative causes that might have given rise to the injury. Another problem with the but-for test in the long-term natural resource damages context is that it can be a pplied only by comparing what happened with a hypothetical alternative148\u2014it requires some sense of what would have happened absent the release of o il or toxics into the environment. While this counterfactual inquiry is speculative by nature (e.g., exactly what would have happened if the de fendant had not run a red light is ultimately unknowable in a metaphysica l sense), for many situations we have built up sufficient intuitions from life experience to make reasonable guesses and temper the speculation.149 For that reason, it is sometimes said, \"any layman is quite as competent\" to answer ordinary cause-in-fact questions as \"the most experienced court.\"150 The same may not be true in 142See Commercial Fishing , EXXON VALDEZ OIL SPILL TRUSTEE COUNCIL , http://www.evostc.state. ak.us/index.cfm?FA=status.human_fishing (last visited Mar. 12, 2014). 143See DOBBS 92, \u00a7\u00a7 186, 187, 189, at 624-26, 631-36. 144For a description of alternative liability theory, which addresses the problem of multiple causes, see R ESTATEMENT (SECOND ) TORTS \u00a7 433B(3) (1965) (\"Where the conduct of two or more actors is tortious, and it is proved that harm has been caused to plaintiff by only one of them, but there is uncertainty as to which one has caused it, the burde n is upon each actor to prove that he has not caused the harm.\"). 145See discussion supra notes 79-84 and accompanying text. 146Kyle Hopkins, Debate Persists About Long-Term Effects of Exxon Valdez Oil Spill , ANCHORAGE DAILY NEWS (Feb. 6, 2009), http://www.adn.co m/2009/02/06/682335/debate-persists- \u00a7 187, 140, at inquires upon common at 1765 (quoting W ILLIAM L.

For long-term injuries, neither laymen nor scientists might be able to offer a plausible guess as to what the state of the environment would have looked like absent the Exxon spill. They might not be able to say what the marine ecosystem would have done in a vacuum. Scientists have a hard enough time discerning the science of what is actually happeni ng, let alone what might happen many years in the future. Legal scholars, practitioners, and scientists have recognized that traditional causation standards might not be a good fit for natural resource injuries. 151 The fit may be even worse for long-term injuries. To that end, scientists examining long-term impact s from oil spills readily described long-term effects as \"more difficult to recognize and assess, primarily because different toxicity mechanisms ar e at work and they do not result in an immediate and obvious mortality.\" 152 The challenge, it would seem, is finding an appropriate causal paradigm\u2014one that provides more than a theoretical opportunity for holding responsible parties liable for long-term impacts and yet is sufficiently discerning so as to uphold notions of fairness underlying tort law. This challenge has been consider ed in the toxic torts literature with respect to latent injuries, 153 but remains surprisingly unexamined for long- term natural resource damages. Taking up that challenge is the subject of the remainder of this Article. II. ASSESSING THE SPACE FOR A NEW CAUSAL PARADIGM Before seeking out an alternate causal paradigm befitting the complexity of proving long-term injuries, one might first ask what room exists in the legal framework for a dopting a nontraditional path. To that end, this Part begins by considering tort law's ability to address complex causal questions like those raised by long-term natural resource damages. This Part goes on to examine the statutory framework and its requirements for proving causation. Next, this Part surveys the limited jurisprudence in which courts have attempted to artic ulate a standard for causation in the natural resource damages context. Finally, this Part comes full circle to tort and considers whether a relaxed causati on paradigm fits the central tenets of tort law. In the end, this Part concludes that room does exist for considering an alternate causal paradigm\u2014in fact there is substantial need for clarity in 151See supra notes 20-22 and accompanying text; see also Robert L. Rabin, Environmental Liability and the Tort System, 24 H OUS. L. REV. 27, 29-32 (1987) (noting th at \"[t]raditional tests of causal responsibility\u2014the but-for principle, substantial factor causation, pro rata joint-and-several liability\u2014are operating in foreign territory when th ey are employed in [environmental tort] cases\"). 152Thomas et Duck Study , 7 (recognizing that \"subtle effects . . be 153See infra Parts II.A, IV.B. N O R T H W E S T E R N U N I V E R S I T Y L A W R E V I E W 500 this unsettled area. Only a small handful of courts have grappled with the causal standard for proving ordinary natural resource injuries, and none have expressly considered long-term injuries.154 The courts that have considered the issue diverge in th e degree to which traditional tort paradigms should govern the causation i nquiry in natural resource damages law. This issue could greatly benefit from some clarification and additional analysis. A. Room Within Tort Law The complicated questions of causation raised by long-term ecological harm are not new to tort law. Time and time again, tort law has proven itself perfectly comfortable with evolving to handle nontraditional problems in a variety of contexts. The most notable evidence of tort law's flexibility is the well-accepted devia tion away from the rigid but-for test and the now widespread preference for the more intuitive substantial factor test. 155 A classic statement of the substantial factor test might provide: [W]here two or more causes have concurred to bring about an event, and any one of them, operating alone, would have been sufficient to cause the identical result, \"the defendant's conduct is a cause of the event if it was a material element and a substantial factor in bringing it about.\" 156 Early cases restricted the application of the substantial factor test to multiple tortious actors, where the ne gligence of more than one person combined to cause harm.157 Courts later expanded the substantial factor test to cases where forces of unknown origin combined with tortious conduct to cause harm.158 In particular, in the classic tort case of Anderson v. Minneapolis, St. P. & S. S. M. Ry. Co. ,159 the defendant negligently started a bog fire that swept over a large area a nd eventually merged with another fire of independent and uncertain origin. The combined fires burned the plaintiff's property and the defendant was held liable. 160 Important for the purposes of natural resource injuries, the \"twin fires\" case established that note PROSSER AND KEETON , supra note 36, \u00a7 41, at 268 (recognizing test as more intuitive than the rigid but-for test). 156ITT Indus., Inc. v. Borgwarner, Inc., 700 2d 848, 876 (W.D. Mich. 2010) (quoting Artesian Water New Castle Cnty., 659 F. Supp. 1269, 1283 (D. Del. 1987) (providing an example of this classic statement and application of the test)); see also In re Methyl Tertiary the need to show that \"each individual defendant's contribution, taken alone , would have caused an injury\" as the defining feature of the substantial factor test (quoting In re Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (\"MTBE\") Prods. Liab. 45 (Minn. 1920). 160Id. at 46. 108:475 (2014) The Long-Term Tort 501 the substantial factor test applies re gardless of whether the multiple causes are natural or man-made.161 These classic versions of the substantial factor test are uniformly considered a legitimate departure from the traditional but-for test and often used to handle more complex questions of causation.162 Indeed, courts that have grappled with setting the proper causal standard for natural resource damages claims have considered adopti ng the substantial factor test. Some have adopted the test while others have rejected it for an even more flexible version called the contributing factor test.163 In addition to the emergence of the substantial factor test to address combined causes, similarly innovativ e doctrines have been created to handle problems of concurrent causes. In the classic case of Summers v. Tice,164 the court adopted a burden-shifting framework to deal with concurrent causes. In that case, the plaintiff was injured when two hunters negligently shot in his direction. U nder the circumstances, it could not be determined which of the two negligen t defendants had actually caused the injury. 165 Recognizing that the plaintiff might be without any remedy under traditional causal paradigm, the Supreme Court of California held both defendants jointly and severally liable. The burden of proof shifted to the defendants to absolve themselves of liability if they could. 166 Tort law's agility in handling complex problems of causation continues in the modern context. For instance, in cases involving medical malpractice claims, courts have assigned liability where the defendant caused an increased risk of harm to the plaintiff or, more often, reduced the plaintiff's chance of survival.167 In those cases, courts recognize the uncertain and speculative nature of predicting what the likely outcome would have been but for the medical malpractice. 168 Nevertheless, courts impose liability to avoid systematic avoidance of liability by physicians in these cases. 169 A similar risk-of-injury approach might be fitting to long- term ecological harms, where the counterfactual inquiry is equally uncertain and yet the tortious actor's role in increasing the likelihood of harm is fairly clear. 161See Robertson, supra note 140, at 1777-78 (describing combined forces test and noting that one force operates independent of an y wrongdoing by the defendant). 162See id. at 1776-78. 163See infra Part II.C. at 3-5. 167See infra notes 337-45, and accompanying text for a discussion of the risk-of-injury analysis in the medical malpractice cases. 168See, e.g., Herskovits v. Grp. Health Coop. of Puget Sound, 664 P.2d 474, 477-78 (Wash. 1983) (en banc) (discussing the difficulty of applying a counterfactual inquiry to a medical malpractice case). 169Id. at 477. N O R T H W E S T E R N U N I V E R S I T Y L A W R E V I E W 502 In addition to the risk-of-injury cases, several innovations have been adopted in the area of toxic torts to deal with problems of proving causation for latent, long-term health injuries. Such issues were at the heart of cases like asbestos litigation, tobacco litiga tion, Agent Orange litigation, and others.170 Indeed, there is a rich body of toxic tort literature discussing problems of proof and seeking out alternate causal frameworks for difficult-to-prove latent injuries.171 The degree to which specific doctrines in toxic tort can adequately address similarly complex causal problems in the natural resource damages context requires closer examination a nd is an issue that will be taken up more fully in Part IV. For now, it is simply worth recognizing that difficult-to-prove causal problems emerge regularly in tort law. The toxic tort cases and others provide ample examples of how tort law has adapted and demonstrated its virtue as a flexible tool. B. Room Within the Statutory Framework If tort law possesses the inherent flexibility needed to tackle emerging causal issues in the natural resource damages context, can the existing statutory framework accommodate such innovative potential? Consider that three major federal congressional st atutes\u2014CERCLA, OPA, and the Clean Water Act\u2014make natural resource damages available for injuries from oil and toxic releases. 172 Under these statutes, federal, state, and tribal trustees have authority to seek natural resour ce damages on behalf of the public. Importantly, long-term natural resource injuries are among the category of injuries that Congress intended to remedy. In particular, natural resource damages are available for a br oad suite of injuries including \"a measurable adverse change, either long- or short-term, in the chemical or physical quality or the viability of a natural resource.\" 173 In addition, in a 170See, e.g. , In re Methyl Tertiary 2009) (applying commingled product th eory liability in a case involving groundwater contamination from gasoline add itive); Hall v. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co., 345 F. Supp. 353 (E.D.N.Y. 1972) (applying enterprise liability in a case involving an unidentifiable asbestos manufacturer); Sindell v. Abbott Labs., 607 P.2d 924 (Cal. 1980) (applying market share liability in a landmark products liability d ecision involving the DES drug). 171See, e.g., David E. Bernstein, Getting to Causation in Toxic Tort Cases , 74 B ROOK . L. REV. 51 (2008); Daniel A. Farber, Toxic Causation , 71 M INN. L. REV. 1219 (1987); Donald G.

Marchant, Genetic Data in Toxic Tort Litigation , 14 J.L. & POL'Y 7 (2006). 172Some states also provide additional statutory schemes allowing recovery for natural resource damages. The causation requirements associated with state statutes is beyond the scope of this Article. Instead, this Article focuses on the major federal st atutes that will be the most instrumental in determining natural resource liabilities for oil spills. 17343 C.F.R. \u00a7 11.14(v) (2013). Of particular note is the fact that damages ar e available for loss of ecosystem function. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 2702(b)(2)(A) (2006). Cf. J.B. Ruhl, Making Nuisance Ecological , 108:475 (2014) The Long-Term Tort 503 move that facilitates recovery for long-term injuries, Congress provided a three-year statute of limitations that runs not from the date of incident but from the date that the injuries are discovered.174 Notably, these statutes do not require any particular level of ecological disruption to characterize a resource as injured. Injury is defined broadly enough to include \"an observable or measurable adverse change in a natural resource.\"175 The broad definition of injury means that assigning liability for long-term natural resource injuries is at least theoretically possible. But what measure of causal proof does Congress deem sufficient to support a claim for long-term injuries? Th e answer to that question is less clear. At a minimum, some causal connection is required. CERCLA, for instance, makes responsible parties liable for \"damages for injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources, including the reasonable costs of assessing such injury, destruction, or loss resulting from such a release .\" 176 OPA similarly provides for natural resource damages that result from a discharge of oil.177 Courts agree that this statutory language requires trustees to show a causal link between injuries and the release.178 In Ohio v. Department of Interior , the D.C. Circuit considered whether a natural resource damages claim required a showing of causation. That case involved several challenges to the De partment of Interior's regulations on natural resource damage assessment under CERCLA. 179 One of the challenges alleged that the level of pr oof required for establishing injury to biological resources was too rigorous and inconsistent with Congress's intent to relax common law burdens of proof for causation. The court recognized that Congress had liberalized causal standards of proof for cost recovery and cleanup actions under CERCLA. Nonetheless, the court refused to require federal agencies to adopt a similar scheme for natural resource damage actions. In particular, the court concluded, \"There is little evidence, however, that Congress specifically intended to ease the standard of proof for showing that a particular spill caused a particular biological injury.\" 180 The court held that CERCLA is ambiguous as to whether causal 58 C ASE W.

Supp. 665, 674 (D. Idaho 1986) (\"(T]he use in Section 107(f) of the word 'resulted' ties the damages to the releases.

N O R T H W E S T E R N U N I V E R S I T Y L A W R E V I E W 504 burdens for natural resource damages cl aims ought to be relaxed in keeping with the broader policy goals of CERCLA.181 In applying Chevron deference to CERCLA's ambiguities on the matter, the court upheld the Department of Interior's incorporati on of traditional causation analysis in its regulations.182 While Ohio v. Department of Interior clarifies the requirement that trustees show a causal link between the release and the injury, it does not resolve the question of the degree of proof required. Congress was silent on the issue and so was the court. In fact, the court's acknowledgment of CERCLA's ambiguity in Ohio v. Department of Interior leaves open the possibility that a more relaxed causal standard would also have been reasonable. In a later D.C. Circuit decision, Kennecott Utah Copper Corp. v. Department of Interior , 183 the court again acknowledged that there must be a causal link between the alleged injury and the release, but noted, \"Congress has not specified precisely what that causal relationship should be.\" 184 Congress appears to have left to the courts' discretion the task of choosing a causal test that is befitti ng to the challenges of proving long- term injuries. Where might the causal test for long-term injuries come from? One natural and obvious option is tort law. In fact, though natural resource damages are provided by statute, sev eral courts have appropriately recognized that a natural resource damages action brought under CERCLA 185 \"sounds basically in tort.\"186 Tort law, in turn, supports a wide range of causal standards, including the traditional but-for test and the more relaxed contributing factor test.187 In determining whether a more lenient causation standard is appropriate for natural resource damag es, one might consider the larger statutory frameworks that house natural resource damages. CERCLA in particular is known for its radical departure from traditional liability 181Id. 182Id. 18388 F.3d 1191 (D.C. Cir. 1996). 184Id. at 1224. 185The similarity in the natural resource damage provisions provided in CERCLA, OPA, and the Clean Water Act support a uniform approach to natural resource damages under any of these major statutes.

Nonetheless, cour ts have excused the victims of hazardous waste injuries from proving causation under CERCLA because of the well-noted difficulties in determining the cause of injuries from hazardous substances.\" 191 Very little separates the natural resource damages from other types of liability created by CERCLA and OPA. In fact, some commentators have noted that the only feature separating natural resource damages from cost recovery actions is that trustees have to show an actual release to recover natural resource damages, whereas r ecovery for cleanup costs requires only a threatened release of oil or other toxins.192 These nearly identical legal frameworks have led at least one comm entator to argue for the same causal standard to apply to natural res ource damages as recovery actions\u2014 namely, to jettison a causal requirement for natural resource damages entirely. 193 Though current statutory frameworks foreclose that option absent legislative reform, the similarity between cost recovery and natural resource damages claims might, at a minimum, suggest that the existing 1884 W ILLIAM H.

L.J. 437, 443 (1996): CERCLA authorizes two types of legal acti ons which allow parties to recover cleanup expenses: cost recovery actions under \u00a7 107(a), which impose joint and several liability, and contribution actions under \u00a7 113(f), which impose only several liability. The section under which a plaintiff proceeds significantly affects parties' rights concerning the scope of the defendant's liability, the plaintiff's burd en of proof, the applicable statute of limitations, and the availability of defenses. Under the \u00a7 107 cost recovery action, a plaintiff may shift virt ually all of its CERCLA liability to the defendant with a relatively light burden of proof. In contrast, the \u00a7 113(f) contribution action only permits plaintiffs to r ecover the defendant's equitable share of the response costs, and imposes a more stringent burden of proof. Id.

Room Within the Existing Jurisprudence In an area replete with complicated causal pathways and multiple forces combining to create harm, courts have struggled in the face of very little congressional guidance to devel op a single standard for proving causation for natural resource damages. Not many courts have considered the issue. 194 Those that have differ in their conclusions and are relatively narrow in their approaches. All suffe r from the confusion that inevitably arises when the substantial factor test from traditional tort law is adopted or rejected without clarification of its meaning. Indeed, further examination reveals that their approaches are not as different as they might otherwise appear. Moreover, their approaches might differ because some are more careful than others to distinguish between cost recovery and natural resource damages actions under CERCLA. 195 One court has declined to formally adopt a new, special causation standard for natural resource da mages claims under CERCLA. In United States v. Montrose Chemical Corp. of California , the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California announced in an unpublished order that a \"sole or substantially contributin g\" factor test applies to determining causation for natural resource damages claims. 196 The issue arose in the context of a motion to dismiss and the court's conclusion was not supported by citations or any analysis . Nonetheless, the court dismissed the trustee's complaint as insufficiently pled because the trustee had not alleged, for each defendant, that specific releases were the \"sole or substantially contributing\" cause of specific natural resource injuries. 197 194Only three courts have decided the issu e, with varying levels of analysis. See Coeur D'Alene Tribe v. Asarco Inc., No. CV91-0342NEJL, CV96-0122NEJL, 2001 WL 34139603, at *4 (D. Idaho Mar. 30, 2001) (rejecting the substantial factor test as too restrictive and adopting the more relaxed contributing factor test); United States v. Montrose Chem.

Mass. 1989) (rejecting substantial factor test as too restrictive and adopting more relaxed contributing factor test). 195There are three major causes of action under CERCLA: cost recove ry claims (imposes joint and several liability for cleanup expenses); contribution cl aims (imposes several liability and allows parties that have been sued to seek indemnity from other potentially responsible parties); and natural resource damages claims (allows specially designated government trustees to seek damages that will be used for restoration). See a plaintiff proceeds significantly affe cts parties' rights concerning the scope of the defendant's liability, the plaintiff's burden of pr oof, the applicable statute of limitations, and the availability of defenses.\" Panzer, supra note 189. Because of these various causes of action, courts and litigants have to be cautious about treating cases from one context as controlling for another. 196Montrose , 1991 WL 183147, at *1. 197Id. 108:475 (2014) The Long-Term Tort 507 The Montrose court did not expressly discuss the bounds of its test. It did not specify what a plaintiff must show in order to satisfy this standard. Must the release be a substantial contributing cause when standing alone, as the classic version of the substantial factor test would require? How significant must the contribution be to rise to the level of \"substantial\"? Since the Montrose case comes out of the Central District of California, and since the California Supreme Court has permitted even very minor forces to be considered \"substantial factor[s],\" 198 perhaps the Montrose court intended to create a lenient version of the substantial factor test. In that case, we might consider whether the Montrose decision is really all that different from the other two courts that have considered the issue. In contrast to the Montrose court, two other district courts have rejected the substantial factor test as too restrictive for natural resource damages claims. Instead, they have adopted a more relaxed contributing factor test. The first district court to adopt a relaxed causal test was the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. In Acushnet River , a CERCLA case involving the PCB contam ination of the Acushnet River and New Bedford Harbor, the court consid ered whether the defendants would be held liable for natural resource damages arising from a mixture of PCB releases\u2014some of which were federall y permitted and some of which were not. 199 The court rejected the substantial factor test and concluded that the trustees need only show that the nonf ederally permitted releases were a \"contributing factor to an injury.\"200 Even though the court in Acushnet River ultimately adopted a contributing factor test, it did so somewhat reluctantly. The court in Acushnet River acknowledged that the first dr aft of its opinion would have required proof that the nonfederally permitted releases were a \"substantial\" factor in bringing about the injury. In a footnote, the court explained that it adopted the more relaxed test because of an intervening decision from the First Circuit, O'Neil v. Picillo . 201 The court did not explain, however, why it believed the First Circuit's opinion was controlling. The First Circuit opinion did reject substantiality as a b asis for determining joint and several liability under CERCLA, but the case dea lt with a recovery action and was not necessarily controlling on the issue of causal standards for natural resource damages. 202 Nonetheless, whether out of confusion or a deliberate attempt to reconcile the various remedies available under CERCLA, the district court in Acushnet River backed away from its initial impulse to impose the more traditional substantial factor test. Like the Montrose court, the court in Acushnet River did not discuss what evidence a plaintiff would 198See, e.g. , Bockrath v. Aldrich Chem. Co., 980 P.2d 398, 404 (Cal. 1999). 199In re n.8 (citing O'Neil v. Picillo, 883 F.2d 176 (1st Cir. 1989)). 202See O'Neil , 883 F.2d at 178, 179 n.4. N O R T H W E S T E R N U N I V E R S I T Y L A W R E V I E W 508 have to show to meet the test adopted by the court. This makes it more difficult to know what the court believed was the difference between \"substantial factor\" and \"contributing factor.\" By the same token, the court in Acushnet River also did not offer an explanation as to what showing is necessary to satisfy the contributing factor test. In a footnote, the court offered only the slightest justification by acknowledging that defendant s responsible only for de minimis contributions to harm should not be held liable. 203 The court only cited two sources that discuss the de minimis exception in the context of the substantial factor test,204 and none that discuss it within the contributing factor test. The court offered no standard for what de minimis means in the more relaxed contributing factor test. The most thorough examination of the proper causal test for natural resource damages came from the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho in Coeur D'Alene Tribe v. Asarco . 205 In that case, federal and tribal trustees filed a natural resource damages claim for injuries caused by mine tailings 206 in northern Idaho.207 In response to the defendant's motion for summary judgment, the court was asked to consider whether the trustees had established the requisite level of causation to prove natural resource damages. 208 The court began its analysis with CERCLA's statutory language and in particular the phrase \"resulting from.\"209 Interestingly, the court found the statutory language ambiguous even on the issue of whether Congress meant to create a stricter causation standard for natural resource damages claims than for response cost actions. 210 On balance, and in keeping with other courts that have considered the threshold issue, the court concluded that CERCLA imposes a causation requirement for natural resource damages claims.211 The court's reading of the statute as ambiguous, however, likely played a role in the court's decision to adopt a lenient standard of causation. In particular, the court 203Acushnet River Mar. 30, 2001). 206Mine tailings are waste byproducts generated when metals are extracted from large quantities of rock during mining operations. See U.S. E NVTL . PROT.

Recall that the D.C. Circuit in Ohio v. Department of Interior had previously held that some proof of causation was required by CERCLA in th e natural resource damage context, even though the statute was ambiguous as to what the particular standard should be. See supra notes 179-82 and accompanying text. 211Coeur D'Alene Tribe , 2001 WL 34139603, at *5. 108:475 (2014) The Long-Term Tort 509 explained that traditional notions of causation do not apply in response cost actions. When there are problems of multiple polluters and commingled waste, imposing quantitative thresholds or requiring the trustee to trace releases to each responsible party is \"too restrictive.\" 212 Applying the rationale associated with response cost cases, the court found that the \"causation standard for [natural resource damage] actions is also less restrictive than traditional federal common law.\"213 The court concluded that where releases have been commingled, trustees have only the burden of proving that a release of commingled hazardous substances is a contributing factor to the harm. 214 To be a contributing factor, the release must have been more than a de minimis amount, and \"at least some of the injury would have occurred if only the Defendant's amount of release had occurred.\"215 Throughout its opinion, the court was careful to distinguish between recovery actions and actions for natural resource damages. The court's adoption of the recovery action rationa le in the natural resource damages context is not a function of confusi on; it is a deliberate recognition that similar causation standards ought to be applied to factual situations that pose similar problems of proof. The court's justification for a less stringent causation standard comes from the problems associated with commingled waste. After articulating the relaxed standard for commingled rel eases, the court went on to say, \"In cases where releases have not been commingled, the burden would be to show that such release was the sole or proximate cause to the injury to the natural resources.\" 216 The court, therefore, distinguished commingled releases from noncommingled releases. This distinction does not emerge from any deeper examination of whether the causal problems in natural resource damages claims actually turn on the characterization of releases as commingled. If taken literally, the court's distinction between commingled and noncommingled waste creates some problems for the recovery of long- term injuries after oil spills or other such singular releases. 217 212Id. 213Id. 214Id. 215Id. 216Id. 217Oil spills are typically singular releases, not co mmingled. Nonetheless, oil spills pose causal dilemmas similar to the kind of commingled h azardous substance release at issue in Asarco and therefore warrant similar treatment. In both cases, th ere are many contributing forces that complicate the causal question. For long-term injuries from si ngular releases like oil spills, there can be multiple sources of toxins negatively impacting the ecosystem in combination, though the relative contribution of each might be unknown. See Conceptual Model , supra note 10, at 672, 690-712 (describing the multiple natural and anthropogenic stressors that affect ecosystem function of Prince William Sound after the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill). Similarly, for commingled waste releases, there are multiple contributors to harm, though the rela tive weight of each is unknown. See Nagle, supra note 191, at 1500 N O R T H W E S T E R N U N I V E R S I T Y L A W R E V I E W 510 To summarize the paucity of jurisprudence, three district courts have considered what causal standard s hould be applied to natural resource damages actions under CERCLA\u2014one used substantial factor, one would have applied substantial factor but for its belief that a First Circuit decision in a recovery action case was controlling (likely a point of confusion), and one would apply a relaxed contributing factor test, but only where there is commingled waste. No courts have expressly considered the issue under OPA. No courts have considered th e unique burdens of proving long-term natural resource injuries. D. Room Within Broader Tort Goals of Corrective Justice and Deterrence It is one thing to say that statutes and court decisions leave room for an alternate causal paradigm for proving lo ng-term natural resource injuries. It is another thing to adopt a relaxed ca usal standard when doing so leaves responsible parties exposed to great er liability for injuries that are admittedly further removed in time from the original spill, and thus more difficult to prove with great certain ty. Before offering up alternate paradigms that would facilitate the r ecovery of long-term damages, it is worth pausing to consider whether doing so would be consistent with underlying principles of tort law. One small caveat is in order. Though there is a rich torts literature and passionate scholarly debate over which goal\u2014corrective justice or deterrence\u2014lies at the heart of tort, stepping into that debate is not the aim of this Article. 218 The aim here is much more modest; it simply asks whether a relaxed form of causation for long-term natural resource injuries is justified under either a corrective just ice or deterrence theory of tort. The character of ecological injuries and the inherent risks associated with oil transport and drilling suggest that a relaxed causal paradigm for natural (describing causation diff iculties under CERCLA); infra note 248 (assembling cases discussing the complex nature of Superfund releases). In each case, there are commingled stressors \u2014whether arising from commingled waste or the uncertain combina tion of multiple forces working together through unknown mechanisms to wreak environmental havoc. In either case, the difficulty of quantifying relative contributions of harm necessitates a causal standard that alleviates the need to weigh the relative contribution of harm from multiple actors or multiple forces. See Nagle, supra note 191. The distinction between multiple polluters and multiple forces, each of which combine to cause harm, may be a distinction without a difference when it comes to the adoption of the contributing factor test. All of this is to say that when the Asarco court suggested that a relaxed cau sation standard wa s not appropriate in the case of noncommingled releases, the court most likely did not have the case of oil spills or long- term injuries in mind. 218For a thorough examination of the scholarly lite rature and debate, see Gary T. Schwartz, Mixed Theories of Tort Law: Affirming Bo th Deterrence and Corrective Justice , 75 T EX. L. REV. 1801, 1802- 11 (1997). 108:475 (2014) The Long-Term Tort 511 resource damages would concurrently serve the corrective justice and deterrence rationales.219 Under the theory of corrective justice, tort liability is rationalized by the moral responsibility that the torti ous actor has to the injured party.220 Corrective justice is an extension of early rationalizations of tort liability in terms of \"fairness\" or \"moral sense of community.\" 221 Viewing the issue from a corrective justice standpoint, relaxing the causal paradigm for long-term natural resource injuries makes good sense for two reasons. The first is the inability of a traditional paradigm to provide full compensation. 222 Retaining a causal paradigm that demonstrably absolves tortious actors from liability for long-term injuries contradicts the corrective justice goal of tort law. Similar observations have been made in the toxic torts context. For example, to avoid systematically undercompensating victims of difficult-to-prove latent injuries, Professor Margaret Berger suggests the causal element be eliminated entirely for certain toxic tort cases. 223 Doing so, she argues, is necessary to serve the needs of corrective justice. Otherwise, \"[c]ausation knocks out the link between culpability and liability.\" 224 While the statutory language of CERCLA and OPA does not permit elimination of the causal element for natural resource damages, 225 Professor Berger's underlying observations apply equally well to the factually si milar context of long-term natural resource damages. The public nature of injuries arguably places greater moral responsibility on the tortious actor to fu lly restore the health of collectively owned resources. To that end, a unique and defining feature of natural resource damages claims are their roots in the public trust doctrine and their purpose of ensuring that the public is adequately compensated for losses to collectively owned natural resources. 226 Also, unlike in toxic torts 219Id. at 1821 (arguing that the American rule of st rict liability for abnormally dangerous activities is justified on both corrective justice and deterrence grounds). 220See, e.g. , George P. Fletcher, Fairness and Utility in Tort Theory , 85 H ARV. L. REV. 537 (1972) (examining corrective justice rationale). 221See Schwartz, supra note 218, at 1802 & n.3 (citing James Barr Ames, Law and Morals, 22 H ARV. L. REV. 97, 101, 109 (1908), as an example of how ear ly justifications of tort law appealed to a sense of fairness). 222See discussion supra Part I.C. 223See Margaret A. Berger, Eliminating General Causation: Notes Towards a New Theory of Justice and Toxic Torts, 97 C OLUM . L. REV. 2117, note 186, at 433-38. For an argument of why greater responsibilities attach to public trust resources, see James M. Olson, Shifting the Burden of Proof : How the Common Law Can Safeguard Nature and Promote an Earth Ethic , 20 E NVTL . L. 891, 906-07 (1990) recognition that sea beds . . . \u2014are critical to the sustainability of earth and are impressed with a public trust, those who seek to alter, reallocate, or dispose of such commons directly\u2014or indirectly through pollution\u2014 have the burden of proving that their proposed N O R T H W E S T E R N U N I V E R S I T Y L A W R E V I E W 512 cases where plaintiffs seek compensa tion for private injuries, natural resource damages must be used to r estore the injured ecosystems. Because recovered damages are earmarked for the public benefit, a more aggressive tort liability scheme (with more relaxed causal requirements) does not carry the risk of providing a windfall to a single individual. Rather, to the extent that a relaxed causal paradigm carries a risk of overcompensation, any resulting windfall returns to the public sphere. Such windfalls might even be characterized as a Pigovian tax 227 on engaging in activities that can result in catastrophic harm. Tort law has long found liability for activities with a high risk of public harm. For example, the abnor mally dangerous activities doctrine imposes strict liability on actors that introduce unusual dangers into the community.228 Before imposing strict liability under this doctrine, courts consider, among other factors, the likelihood that any resulting harm will be great, the existence of a high degree of risk to the land of others, and the inability to eliminate the risk th rough exercise of reasonable care. 229 These factors could be applied to oil transport or drilling. Consider that the New Jersey Supreme Court has applied this doctrine to hold a \"landowner . . . strictly liable to others for harm caused by toxic wastes . . . stored on his property and flow[ing] onto the property of others.\" 230 Of course, the idea here is not to argue for a strict liability regime for oil spills, but rather to illustrate that tort law has seen fit to relax liability schemes for activities that by their very nature pose great risk to the public. Under similar logic, it would seem that tort law could amply support a relaxed causal standard as consistent with its underlying goals of fairness and deterrence. In fact, a tort system focused on corrective justice would conduct would not impair the functiona l or sustainable level of these natural systems or their values. The public trust, by shifting the burde n of proof, thus bri ngs an ethical dimension within the reach of the legal system.\"). 227A Pigovian tax (also spelled Pigouvian) is a \"tax levied on an agent causing an environmental externality (environmental damage) as an in centive to avert or mitigate such damage.\" Pigouvian Tax Definition , GLOSSARY OF STAT.

Ventron Corp., 468 A.2d 150, 157 (N.J. 1983). 108:475 (2014) The Long-Term Tort 513 reject the prospect of a private tortfeasor reaping profit from an activity that leaves the public to absorb the cost of long-term harm.231 There is at least one countervailing consideration. Though oil transport and drilling might well be high-risk activities, these activities are not without public benefit. Some might argue that the public and industrial society demand the existence of oil companies and their engagement in oil transport and drilling, despite the known risks. Given the public service provided by oil transport and drilling, some might argue that imposing harsher standards of liability simply shifts the responsibility of an oil-dependent nation from society writ large onto the few companies that have taken on the task of providing a desired service. Courts would likely reject the idea that the public demand for oil might justify less rigorous forms of liab ility. Such a social utility analysis, if litigants were inclined to sugg est one, might be derived from the unavoidably unsafe products doctrine. That doctrine has been invoked most prominently in cases where products liability actions are made against manufacturers of vaccines. 232 In those cases, the societal goal of maintaining an adequate supply of vacci nes outweighs the risks inherent in the products, and courts have limited tort liability.233 In other areas where defendants have made similar social utility arguments, however, courts have rejected them. For example, the Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected an electric utility's argument that the benefits of providing electricity for the community outweighed the harm suffered by a plaintiff: \"We know of no acceptable rule of jurisprudence that permits those who are engaged in important and desirable enterprises to injure with impunity those who are engaged in enterprises of lesser economic significance.\" 234 It is not simply tort's corrective justice goal that would be served by a causal paradigm more befi tting the difficulties of proving long-term natural 231See Sindell v. Abbott Labs., 607 P.2d 924, 936 (Cal. 19 80) (\"[A]s between an innocent plaintiff and negligent defendants, the latter should bear the cost of the injury.\"); see also Escola v. Coca Cola Bottling Co., 150 P.2d 436, 441 (Cal. 1944) (en banc) (\"The cost of an injury and the loss of time or health may be an overwhelming misfortune to the person injured, and a needless one, for the risk of injury can be insured by the manufacturer and distributed among the public as a cost of doing business.\"). 232See RESTATEMENT (SECOND ) OF TORTS \u00a7 402A cmt. k (1965) (discussing the unavoidably unsafe products doctrine and its application to vaccines); see also Graham v.

A relaxed causal st andard for natural resource damages also serves the deterrence goal of tort law. That goal is worth pursuing for two reasons. First, the injuries resu lting from an oil spill are catastrophic and hard, if not impossible, to undo.235 There is no doubt that every oil spill leaves a permanent stain on the environm ent, so there is an even greater need to deter oil spills from occurring in the first place. Second, many oil spills are avoidable. Consider the type of corporate behavior that resulted in the BP Gulf Oil Spill and the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill. The Exxon spill was the result of a corporate culture that had become complacent with alcoholism and desensitized to the risk of oil transport.236 Similarly, the BP spill was the result of a pattern of reckless decisions regarding the maintenance and safety of oil rigs. 237 The avoidability of the Exxon and BP oil spills suggest that deterrence still has a role to play. One way to encourage corporations to attend to safety is through legislation, in the way that Congress passed OPA in 1990 after the Exxon spill. Another way is to demand more complete liability and adopt a causal paradigm that holds tortfeasors liable for the full suite of ecological injuries. The risk of more substantia l damages would motivate corporations engaged in oil transport and drilling to a dhere more strictly and consistently to safety protocols. In some ways, this is simply an argument for assigning liability to the cheapest cost avoider, which is the party in the best position to identify risks and adopt modifications in behavior. 238 The idea that tort law would support assigning liability to the cheapest cost avoider is not new.239 Judge Guido Calabresi has long since and aptly remarked that the deterrence goals in tort law are to be achieved \"by creating incentives so that people will avoid those future injuries worth avoiding and thus achieve an optimal trade-off between safety and injury in a world where safety is not a free good, and hence injury is not a total 235For a discussion of ecological injuries following the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill, see supra Part I.A. 236See Brief of Experts on Alcohol in the Wor kplace as Amici Curiae Supporting Respondents, Exxon Shipping Co. v.

IDENTIFYING THE CORE CAUSAL CHALLENGES Having identified the need for a new causal paradigm to remedy long- term ecological injuries, and having concluded that space for an alternate paradigm exists, the logical next question is what such a paradigm might look like. Indeed, given that tort law has a history of grappling with difficult questions of causation, the real question is whether tools already exist that could adequately address th e causal problems raised by long-term ecological injuries. Where is the flexibility of tort law needed? In other words, what are the core causal challenges that lie at the heart of long-term ecological injuries? One way of uncovering the core challenges might be to consider what they are not. For instance, in the area of toxic torts, an area raising similar problems of latent, long-term injuri es, courts have fashioned numerous innovative approaches to causation. Many of these innovations address problems of the indeterminate defendant. 245 While those cases involve injuries traceable to a particular ty pe of product (e.g., asbestos), difficult questions of causation arise because the plaintiff cannot identify which of the many defendant product manufacturers caused the harm. 246 To deal with 240Calabresi, Concerning Cause , supra note 35, at 77. 241Id. at 81 (\"The requirement of proximity in causal relationships, unlike that of but for relationships, may help to select from the unive rse of causally linked actions those actions worth deterring collectively.\"); id. at 85 (suggesting that \"[o]ne could do away with the but for test\" if one employed other methods for identi fying the cheapest cost avoider); id. at 88 (\"Past foreseeability is not, however, a prerequisite to liability if the object is market deterrence.\"). 242Id. at 107. 243Id. at 106. 244Id. at DOBBS ET AL supra note 92, \u00a7 189, at 633 & n.10 (listing examples of many different tort doctrines that might be relevant in a multiple polluter situation). 246Classic burden-shifting cases like Summers v. Tice , 199 P.2d 1 (Cal. 1948) (en banc), are likewise founded on the notion that all releva nt defendants are before the court. In Summers, for instance, there were only two possible defendants, bot h of those defendants were before the court, both defendants acted negligently, and one of those defendants actually caused the injury. See 199 P.2d at 1- 2. However, in situations where the cause of an injury is not fu lly known and where there are multiple potential defendants, not all of whom are parties to the case, courts are more reluctant to impose joint and several liability under Summers. See, e.g. , Sindell v. Abbott Labs., 607 P.2d 924, 931 (Cal. 1980) (rejecting the application of Summers to the toxic tort context where there were over 200 potential N O R T H W E S T E R N U N I V E R S I T Y L A W R E V I E W 516 this problem, some courts have applied a theory of \"enterprise liability,\" whereby all manufacturers of a given product are held jointly liable if they adhered to industry-wide safety standa rds that created an unreasonable risk of harm. 247 Similar to the indeterminate defendant problem, many CERCLA cases grapple with the difficulties of apportioning harm among multiple polluters. Typically, those cases involve the release of a hazardous substance that is a mixture of substances from many generators leaking from hundreds of barrels or more. 248 Given the length of time over which releases occurred and the number of par ties that have contributed over time to the pool of toxic waste, separa ting whose waste caused what harm is nearly impossible.249 In fact, the causal difficulties that arise in that situation are well-known drivers in Congress's decision to jettison a traditional causation requirement in CERCLA cost recovery actions. 250 In those actions, the government only needs to show that there was a release from the site, but it need not show which potentially responsible party's substance caused the actual harm. 251 One key feature of multiple polluter cases is that a group of potentially responsible parties is typically identified by their relation to the site where the release took place.

Owens-Ill., Inc., 941 P.2d 1203, 1216 (Cal. 1997) (noting that \"the majority of courts have refused to extend the doctrine of alternative liability and its burden-shifting\" to cases where the court is uncertain whether the culpable party is before the court). 247See, e.g. , Hall v. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co., 345 F. Supp. 353 (E.D.N.Y. 1972).

The leading case on imposing joint and several liability under CERCLA, U.S. v. Chem-Dyne Corp. , described the nature of its fair ly complex factual determination like this: The Chem-Dyne facility contains a variety of hazardous waste from 289 generators or transporters, consisting of about 608,000 pounds of material. Some of the wastes have commingled but the identities of the sources of thes e wastes remain unascerta ined. The f act of the mixing of the wastes raises an issue as to the divi sibility of the harm. Further, a dispute exists over which of the wastes have contaminated the gro und water, the degree of their migration and concomitant health hazard. 572 F. Supp. 802, 811 (S.D. Ohio 1983). 249Bell Petroleum , 3 F.3d at 897-99 (surveying CERCLA jurisprudence on joint and several liability and describing multiple cases in which cour ts found it difficult to apportion liability from multiple, commingled sources); see also O'Neil v.

Incidents like the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill or the BP Gulf Oil Spill are readily identifiable in terms of the substance released, the parties responsib le for that release, and the timing of the release. In the oil spill context, therefore, the causation dilemma goes beyond apportioning liability among members of an identifiable group. Unlike problems of apportioning ha rm among multiple defendants, the most nettlesome problem characterizing long-term harms from oil spills is the differentiation of harm from bac kground stressors and the oil exposure itself. Oceans are particularly challe nging in this regard. Several scholars and international organizations have noted that the background degraded state of the oceans is a substantial issue. 254 For example, the United Nations Environment Program has assembled a laundry list of background stressors that threaten ocean ecosystems, including pollution from \"land-based sources, oil spills, untreated sewage , heavy siltation, eutrophication (nutrient enrichment), invasive species, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), . . . acidification, radioactive substances, marine litter, overfishing and destruction of coastal and marine habitats.\" 255 Climate change is adding to and compounding these existing background stressors.256 A 2011 workshop led by the International Programme on the State of the Ocean and the International Union for Conservation of Nature concluded that \"[r]esilience of the ocean to climate change impacts is severely compromised by the other stressors from human activities\" and that \"[e]cosystem collapse is occurring as a result of both current and emerging stressors.\" 257 As Professor Robin Kundis Craig has explained, these background stressors are even more problematic when synergistic interactions are 252See Chem-Dyne Corp. , 572 F.

Overfishing can also interact synergistically with other stresses, such as marine pollution, to destroy the productivity of a particular marine area.\" 259 In more general terms, Professor Robert Rabin has described the problems of collective and synergistic harms for environmental torts: [E]nvironmental torts evoke an entirely different perspective on liability, one which is virtually unknown at common law. Frequently, environmental harm is a consequence of the aggregate risk created by a considerable number of independently acting enterprises. . . . Or, it may be that the risk inherent in the product is substantial, but it soon merges into a common pool. Whatever the case, environmental harm is very often collective harm.260 Few tort doctrines grapple expressly with situations where man-made and natural or background forces combine to create a single, indivisible injury. A notable exception is the twin fires case that was an early adopter of the substantial factor analysis.261 In that case, two fires combined to burn down the plaintiff's property; one fire was from an unknown origin and could not therefore be traced to a tortious actor. Nonetheless, the court applied the substantial factor test and concluded that the defendant could be held liable even where another for ce\u2014whether natural or unnatural\u2014might also have independently caused the harm. There is one caveat, however. Each cause has to be sufficient on its own to cause the harm. 262 This caveat poses no problem to the twin fires scenario but the same might not be true in some natural resource damage s settings where there are multiple contributing causes, whose collective stress gives rise to harm even though no one individual stressor would be suff icient. In that way the twin fires formulation of the substantial factor test fails to recognize harm from synergistic causes. This is not to say that tort law, or the substantial factor test, is incapable of addressing synergistic harm s. California courts, for instance, have adopted a broad version of the subs tantial factor test that would hold defendants liable so long as \"the contribution of the individual cause [is] more than negligible or theoretical.\" 263 In addition, the idea of synergistic harms has been identified in the Restatement (Third) of Torts . In particular, comment f observes that the substantial factor test would be appropriate in 258See Avoiding Jellyfish Seas , supra note 254, at 26. 259Id. 260Rabin, supra note 151, at 32. 261See supra and accompanying text. 262DOBBS ET AL ., supra note 92, \u00a7 189, 941 P.2d 1203, 1220 (Cal. 1997); also Bockrath v. Aldrich Chem. Co., 980 P.2d 398, 404 (Cal. 1999) (emphasizing th e broad nature of the substantial factor test by clarifying that \"a very minor force that does cause harm is a substantial factor\"). 108:475 (2014) The Long-Term Tort 519 situations where the tortious conduct combines with other forces to create harm (even if it does not create harm on its own): In some cases, tortious conduct by one actor is insufficient, even with other background causes, to cause the plaintiff's harm. Nevertheless, when combined with conduct by other persons, the conduct overdetermines the harm, i.e., is more than sufficient to cause the harm. . . . The fact that an actor's conduct requires other conduct to be sufficient to cause another's harm does not obviate the applicability of this Section. 264 In this way, the Restatement Third seems to support the use of the substantial factor test (or some vers ion thereof) in cases where exposure to oil combined with other environmental stressors (including background stressors) to create harm. Similarly, the Restatement would seem to recognize the imposition of liability where synergistic effects of an oil spill give rise to harm. Conceptually, comment f comes clos est to appropriately capturing the multiple interacting forces that poten tially combine to create harm when toxic stressors are added to sensitive ma rine ecosystems. To the extent that this approach most accurately describes the problems faced by trustees in the natural resource damages context, it provides a useful starting point for thinking about how to apply doctrines like the contributing factor test to injuries manifesting in the long-term wake of oil spills. This might be a good place to pause for a moment and consider why tortfeasors should be prepared to shoulder the costs of long-term harms, especially if they arise only in comb ination with other forces of nature. Why should Exxon or BP be held liabl e for long-term injuries when those injuries will necessarily be a partial function of environmental factors beyond their control? The Gulf of Mexico, for instance, was not exactly a poster child for pristine ecosystems before the BP Gulf Oil Spill. 265 And the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill is certainly not solely responsible for the inevitable extinction of the AT-1 pod of killer whales in Prince William Sound.266 In each of these examples, the tortfeasor might contribute only relatively small stressors, but in the already fragile state of an overstressed ecosystem, these could lead to more catastrophic long-term impacts than would otherwise have been predicted. In the case of the killer whale pods, the harm may be the acceleration of an adverse but probable event. One reason tortfeasors should shou lder the burden of synergistic harms might come from a basic principle of tort: nature is like a classic eggshell plaintiff. 267 Parties such as Exxon or BP, who are engaged in risky 264RESTATEMENT (THIRD ) OF TORTS : LIABILITY FOR PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL HARM \u00a7 27 cmt. f, at 380 (2010). 265Craig, A Match Made in Hell , supra note 12, at 1890. 266See supra AL ., 92, \u00a7 206, at 711-13 (explaining the eggshell plaintiff rule and its role in the proximate cause inquiry). N O R T H W E S T E R N U N I V E R S I T Y L A W R E V I E W 520 behavior with potentially catastrophic environmental consequences, take the plaintiff as they find it. Nature comes in complicated forms with varying levels of susceptibility to in jury, depending on the other stressors acting upon the particular ecosystem at issue. Complications like climate change and natural variability are simply part of the backdrop. Indeed, enough evidence that climate change is happening has emerged that it can fairly be considered the new vulnerable and uncertain state in which nature exists. When viewed as simply part of the eggshell plaintiff that is nature herself, climate change, like a preexis ting condition, cannot fairly serve as a counterexplanation for long-term harm. Given that enough scientific literature has now been assembled to make long-term injuries more foreseeable, the eggshell plaintiff rule is even more apt\u2014that long-term injuries will be sustained is foreseeable even if the amount or particular type of the harm is still unknown. 268 An alternative approach woul d be apportionment\u2014that is, apportioning harm between background stressors and the oil spill defendant. Apportionment, a concept that has been both suggested269 and criticized270 in the toxic tort context, would hold defendants liable for only the portion of the harm that was attribut able to the oil spill. The appeal of such an approach is fairness to the defendant, and for that reason, it is worth considering. 271 The practical infeasibility of apportionment, however, demands a different solution. In the CERCLA cost recovery context, where there are multiple polluters who have contributed or potentially contributed hazardous substances to a site of release, courts have rejected apportionment as too 268Id. (describing the rule as one that imposes liability for foreseeable harms even when the amount of harm is not foreseeable). 269See, e.g. , Dafler v. Raymark Indus., , 622 A.2d 1305 (N.J. 1993) (affirming apportionment between smoking and asbestos); Gerald W. Boston, Toxic Apportionment: A Causation and Risk Contribution Model , 25 E NVTL .

Guo, Reasonable Bases for Apportioning Harm Under CERCLA , 37 E COLOGY L.Q. 317, 319-20 (2010) (\"Making apportionment easier to justify, and thereby making recovery of cleanup costs harder to obtain, contravenes CERCLA's objective of placing the cost of cleanup on persons whose activities c ontributed to the contamination.\"). 271See Jules L. Coleman, Tort Law and the Demands of Corrective Justice , 67 I ND. L.J. 349 (1992); Christopher H. Schroeder, Corrective Justice and Liability for Increasing Risks , 37 UCLA L. REV. 439 (1990). 108:475 (2014) The Long-Term Tort 521 complicated and burdensome on the plaintiff.272 Rather, Congress has accepted a polluter-pays approach that assigns liability and then leaves potentially responsible parties to sort out apportionment among themselves.273 Similar complications would arise if courts attempted to apportion harm for long-term ecological harms. In fact, it would conceivably be even more difficult to apportion harm betwee n a defendant and an unquantifiable mixture of diffuse environmental stressors that together depress the healthy functioning of an ecosystem. 274 Imagine, for a moment, how one would divide liability among the impacts of overfishing, climate change, and runoff pollution on a marine ecosystem. First, one would have to quantify the degree to which each of the stressors impacted the marine ecosystem and by which biological pathways. 275 After all, the relevance of each stressor's contribution to the harm will depend on the type of harm at issue. Second, one would have to know how each of the stressors interacted with the others so that synergistic potential could be accounted for. 276 These 272See, e.g. , O'Neil v. Picillo, 883 F.2d 176, 179 (1st Cir. 1989) (noting that \"where wastes of varying (and unknown) degrees of toxicity and migr atory potential commingle, it simply is impossible to determine the amount of environmental harm caused by each party\"). 273Nagle, supra note 191, at 1493, 1509 (explaining that CERCLA is a \"polluters pay\" liability scheme that has been interpreted to impose joint a nd several liability on defenda nts in part because of \"the difficulty a plaintiff encounters in trying to prove that the actions of a par ticular defendant were the cause in fact of the hazardous subs tances, especially at sites where many companies and individuals contributed substances\"); see also Marsh v. Rosenbloom, 499 F.3d 165, 178 (2d Cir. 2007) (\"CERCLA manifests Congress's intent that hazardous waste site s should be cleaned up and that those responsible for the contamination should bear the costs.\"); Un ited States v.

Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc., 805 F.2d 1074, 1081 (1st Cir. 1986))). 274A number of courts have rejected apportionment for commingled waste. See William C. Tucker, All Is Number: Mathematics, Divisibility and Apportionment Under Burlington Northern, 22 F ORDHAM ENVTL . L. REV. 311, 322 n.47 (2011) (assembling cases where apportionment was rejected). 275See id. at 316 (\"[I]n proving that the harm at a Superf und site is divisible, a defendant must take into account a number of factors relating not just to the contribution of a particular defendant to the harm, but also to the effect of that defendant's waste on the environment, including the 'relative toxicity, migratory potential, degree of migrati on or \"synergistic capacities\" of the hazardous substances at issue.'\" (quoting United States v. Agway, Inc., 193 F. Supp. 2d 545, 548 (N.D.N.Y. 2002))). 276For an example of a court rejecting apportionm ent because of unknown synergistic potential, see United States v. Vertac Chemical Corp ., 966 F. Supp. 1491, 1504 (E.D. 1997), which rejected volumetric apportionment based on the number of barrels, because where \"hazardous substances are commingled, a defendant cannot rely on merely volumetric evidence.\" N O R T H W E S T E R N U N I V E R S I T Y L A W R E V I E W 522 types of inquiries have proven unworkable in other tort contexts and have been squarely criticized as a result.277 The complication of apportionment, as it turns out, may be a reason to adopt a more simplified view of background stressors, one where background stressors are simply accepted as part of the inherent character of the injured ecosystem. Of course, as in the CERCLA context, if a defendant insists on apportionment to reduce its liability, the court could shift the burden of proof on the defendant to demonstrate that harm could be apportioned. 278 The issue of burden shifting even outside the context of apportionment is taken up later. IV. IN SEARCH OF CLARITY AND A NEW CAUSAL PARADIGM By unpacking the core causation cha llenges, some of the existing tort innovations can be ruled out as possible solutions. More importantly, existing tools can be better assessed. In particular, this Part examines the viability of three approaches that courts have used to resolve difficult-to-prove cases of causation. First, it is possible that courts should simply continue to apply a contributing fact or test. This Part considers that possibility and explains how courts might avoid unduly restricting the usefulness of the contributing factor test for resolving long-term harms. Next, this Part examines whether the general-specific causation framework adopted in toxic tort would be benefici al for long-term ecological harms. In doing so, this Part explores whether a risk-of-injury analysis, like that adopted by some courts in the medical malpractice or smoker-asbestos cases, might ultimately strike the righ t balance between holding responsible actors accountable and protecting defe ndants from undue liability. Finally, this Part discusses when courts might reasonably resort to a burden-shifting framework. A. Assessing the Contributing Factor Test Can the contributing factor test pr operly assign liability and respond to problems of background stressors and synergistic effects? The roots of the substantial factor test suggest that its more lenient counterpart\u2014the contributing factor test\u2014could be applied to find liability among multiple 277See Kenneth S. Abraham, Individual Action and Collective Responsibility: The Dilemma of Mass Tort Reform , 73 V A. L. REV. 845, 865 (1987) (rejecting proposals for proportionate causation, remarking that \"[l]ogical though this approach might be, it is unfortunately very impractical, because nothing even remotely as precise a proxy for the probability of responsibility as market share is available in most nonsignature disease cases\"). 278See, e.g. , United States v. Chem-Dyne Corp., 572 F. Supp. 802, 810 (S.D. Ohio 1983) (\"[W]here the conduct of two or more persons liable under \u00a7 9607 [of CERCLA] has combined to violate the statute, and one or more of the defendan ts seeks to limit his liability on the ground that the entire harm is capable of apportionment, the burden of proof as to apportionment is upon each defendant.\"). 108:475 (2014) The Long-Term Tort 523 forces, whether natural or man-made. To be sure, the doctrine appears suited to handle problems of synergistic harms, and nothing in the tort doctrines themselves would prohibit extension of the contributing factor test to the oil spill context where there is a single release. More importantly, the intuitive nature of the test would provide much-needed flexibility in an area where injuries and causal pathways will be diverse and will require a nimble hand in determining when causation has been established. To be sure, doctrines of great flexibility can also bring great confusion. In that sense, the courts would be wise to clarify the contours of the contributing factor test before adopting it wholesale. Indeed, the few courts that have adopted the contributing factor test in the classic CERCLA context have perhaps left more questio ns than they have answered. Before simply endorsing the contributing factor test, therefore, courts would be wise to (1) clarify what the contributing factor test requires and (2) avoid unnecessary restrictions that undermine th e test's usefulness for addressing background stressors and synergistic harms. 1. Clarifying the Test.\u2014 Courts that have grappled with setting the proper causal standard for natural resource damages claims have considered whether to adopt the substantial factor test or its more relaxed cousin, the contributing factor test. Some have adopted the substantial factor test and some have rejected it. All have assumed that the test has a single formulation, as if calling it by name carries with it a well-settled and clear body of jurisprudence. In truth, the substantial factor test has taken on several forms. 279 The range of formulations helps to explain why courts in the natural resource damages context have been thus far unable to speak with much uniformity or clarity regarding the appropriate causal standard. The early form of the substantial factor test would hold a defendant liable, even where there are several to rtious acts, if the defendant's conduct was \"a material element and a substantial factor\" in bringing about the harm.280 The twin fires case opened the t est up to cases where natural forces combined with tortious conduct to cause harm.281 Notably, both of these more classic versions require each cause to be capable of the entire harm standing alone. 282 As discussed above, that requirement could prove 279Robertson, supra note 140, at 1776 (describing confusion associated with courts having used the term \"substantial factor\" test in three different senses). 280PROSSER AND KEETON supra note 36, \u00a7 41, at 281Robertson, note 140, at 1779 n. 57. 282See ITT Indus., Inc. v. Borgwarner, Inc., F. Supp. 2d 848, 876 (W.D. Mich. 2010) (\"[W]here two or more causes have concurred to br ing about an event, and any one of them, operating alone, would have been sufficient to cause the identical result, 'the de fendant's conduct is a cause of the event if it was a material element and a substantial f actor in bringing it about. '\" (quoting Artesian Water Co. v. Gov't of New 659 F. Supp. 1269, 461, 464 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (describing the need to show that \"defendant's contribution, taken alone , would have caused an injury\" as the defining N O R T H W E S T E R N U N I V E R S I T Y L A W R E V I E W 524 problematic for long-term harms that result from synergistic impacts of the oil spill in combination with background stressors. That said, the California Supreme Court's version of the substantial factor test would assign liability to even \"very minor force[s]\" so long as they contributed to the harm in some way.283 This version appears to impose liability even for synergistic ca uses and might even equate to what other courts are terming the contributing factor test. Related to these relatively simple statements of the substantial factor test, some courts have concluded that multiple forces contributing to the harm will be deemed causes-in-fact so long as their conduct viewed as a whole gave rise to the harm and so long as any one force is not so insignificant when compared to the others. 284 One such version of this is really a but-for inquiry, where there are many individual but-for causes that combine to create injury even though none of them standing alone would have generated the harm. Indeed, in this version courts appear to say they are applying the substantial factor te st and then confusingly go on to examine causation under the traditional but-for test. 285 Other courts apply the substantial factor test to resolve issues of proximate cause.286 In an apparent attempt to assemble these various perturbations, the Restatement (Second) of Torts introduces yet another set of several factors for courts to consider.287 feature of the substantial factor test (quoting In re Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (\"MTBE\") Prods.

In a 1912 article in the Harvard Law Review , Jeremiah Smith proposed using the substantial factor test to guide the proximate cause inquiry. See Jeremiah Smith, Legal Cause in Actions of Tort , 25 H ARV. L. REV. 303, 308-10 (1912). Some courts have taken up the suggestion. See, e.g., Mitchell v. Gonzales, 819 P.2d 872, 878 (Cal. 1991) (en banc) (holding that jury instructions should use the term \"substantial factor\" rather than \"proximate cause\" because the latter term was more likely to mislead jurors and confuse). But see Viner v. Sweet, 70 P.3d 1046, 1050-51 (Cal. 2003) (clarifying that Mitchell did \"but for\" test for causation). 287See RESTATEMENT (SECOND ) OF TORTS \u00a7 433, at 432 (1965). These factors, on the whole, appear to be more in line with th e version of the test that would hold contributing forces liable for the harm: 1. The extent to which the defendant's actions cont ributed to the harm, comp ared to the extent to which other forces contributed to the harm; 2. Whether the defendant's actions created a force or series of forces that operated up to the time of the harm, or by contrast, whether the defe ndant's actions were harmless until acted upon by forces outside the defendant; and 3. The amount of time that elapsed between the defendant's actions and the harm. See id. Of note, this last consideration would system atically undermine the recovery of long-term damages, as by definition that is a category of harm s for which substantial time has elapsed between the conduct and the injury. Courts should approach the application of the Restatement cautiously in the 108:475 (2014) The Long-Term Tort 525 The lesson, at bottom, is that the subs tantial factor test is not a rigid or mechanical one. It is intuitive in nature and has given rise to many formulations. This means that courts purporting to apply the substantial factor test to resolve causation issues need to be deliberate in their description and application of the test. Simply uttering \"substantial factor test\" does not in and of itself clarify the causal standard being applied. 288 Rather, it invites confusion unless add itional parameters are set forth. Confusion is precisely what appears to be emerging in the natural resource damages context. In particular, the district courts in Asarco and Acushnet River rejected the substantial factor test in favor of the less restrictive contributing factor test. Bu t less restrictive as compared to what? Neither court adequately defined the dimensions of the test that it was rejecting, making it more difficult to understand the alternative that it had in mind. Since there are many versions of the substantial factor test, more information is needed to discern what ca usal test the courts meant to reject or adopt. In addition, the Montrose court out of California adopted the substantial factor test, which may e ffectively amount to the contributing factor test anyway depending on the version that the court had in mind. 289 The Asarco case offers the most thorough analysis. It relies on a Ninth Circuit opinion involving a CERCLA cost recovery action.290 In that opinion, Boeing v. Cascade Corp. , the Ninth Circuit described the twin fires version of the substantial factor te st and concluded that such a test is appropriate in the special case of causal overdetermination: [W]here either polluter's conduct would have caused the same response cost to be incurred in the same amount, and the conduct was of substantially equal blameworthiness, the proper construction of the causation requirement in the statute is that both polluters should be treated as having caused the response cost.291 Having referenced this traditional test for causation, the Asarco court went on to note that \"for the response cost claim, traditional notion[s] of proximate cause do[] not apply.\"292 Though the court recognized that\u2014 unlike in response cost claims\u2014there is a causation requirement for injury to natural resources, the court concluded that the \"causation standard for [natural resource damages] actions is also less restrictive than traditional context of long-term injuries for that reason, or risk systematically undermin ing Congress's intent to allow recovery for injuries that are long-term in nature. 288See, e.g. , Rutherford v. Owens-Ill., term 'substantial factor' . . .\"). 289See supra notes 196-98 and Inc., No. CV91-0342NEJL, CV96-0122NEJL, 2001 WL 34139603, at *4-5 (D. Idaho Mar. 30, 2001) (citing Boeing v. Cascade Corp., 207 F.3d 1177, 1185 (9th Cir. 2000)). WL 34139603 at *5. N O R T H W E S T E R N U N I V E R S I T Y L A W R E V I E W 526 federal common law.\"293 The court rejected the \"sole or substantially contributing cause\" test as too restrictive in the natural resource damages context.294 It would appear that the court was at a minimum rejecting the classic form of the substantial factor test\u2014the trustee need not show that the contributing cause would be sufficient to cause the injury if standing alone. However, the court's reference to proximate cause suggests that the court might also have meant to relax the proximate cause inquiry and expand the scope of liability to natural resource injuries that are more indirect and further removed from the release itself. Unfortunately, the court's analysis of the substantial factor test is not specific enough in terms of torts nomenclature to know for sure what the court had in mind, other than that the new test ought to be less restrictive. Of course, in a perfect world the causal test that the courts intended to adopt would be obvious because the pref erred test would be adequately described. That too turns out to be pr oblematic. In other words, not only is it unclear what the Acushnet River and Asarco courts meant to reject in terms of a substantial factor test, but it is also unclear what kind of causal showing they intended the contributing factor test to require. Each court refers to the contributing factor test as though that test is well established in torts literature. This in fact is not the case. While the Restatement and the literature discuss the substantial factor test, the contributing factor test does not appear in the torts nomenclature. 295 The best explanation of what the contributing factor test means comes from the Asarco court. After rejecting the substantial factor test, the court explained that \"[i]n cases where releases have been commingled, the Court finds the [t]rustees have the burden of proving a release that results in commingled hazardous substances is a 'contributing factor.'\" 296 The court defined a contributing factor as \"more than a de minimis amount\u2014to an extent that at least some of the in jury would have occurred if only the Defendant's amount of release had occurred.\" 297 Setting aside the qualification for commingled waste, the Asarco court appears to be describing the California version of the substantial factor test, where even very minor forces can be causes-in-fact sufficient to create liability. The only limit appears to be that the contributing force is something more than de minimis . What that threshold is, however, the court did not say. In future cases, courts (or the legislature if it cares to take up the issue) can provide 293Id. 294Id. 295See P ROSSER , ET AL ., supra note 92, \u00a7\u00a7 186-187, 189, at 623-36, for absence of any reference to a rela xed form of the substantial factor test or the contributing factor test. 296Coeur D'Alene Tribe , 2001 WL 34139603 at *5. 297Id. 108:475 (2014) The Long-Term Tort 527 clarity regarding the contours of the contributing factor test by being more explicit about what they are rejecting and what they mean to adopt. To assist courts in their clarification, there may be some reference points that can help ground the contributing factor test in existing principles and thereby explain its dimensions . First, as mentioned above, the contributing factor test could be a shorthand way of referring to the least rigorous form of the substantial factor t est, what this Article refers to as the California version. Second, and similarl y, the test might refer to a comment made in the Restatement (Second) of Torts that explains, \"[I]f the defendant's conduct had any effect , the effect was substantial.\" 298 Third, some prominent commentators have s uggested that the conduct of multiple actors can be aggregated and considered as a whole using the but-for inquiry: When the conduct of two or more actors is so related to an event that their combined conduct, viewed as a whole, is a but-for cause of the event, and application of the but-for rule to them individually would absolve all of them, the conduct of each is a cause in fact of the event. 299 Professor Richard Wright similarly suggested conceptualizing causation in a way that aggregates conduct or events into a set.300 Rather than impose an aggregate but-for test , Wright would find causation has been established \"if the entire set of events is sufficient to cause the harm and the defendant's act is a necessary element of the set.\"301 Under this formulation, oil spills that set off a chain of events and contribute to an altered natural environmen t might be lumped into a set of events that together caused the injury and therefore give rise to liability. Wright's aggregate formulation appears consis tent with the relaxed contributing factor test. A similar theory\u2014called the commingled product theory\u2014has been applied in product liability cases. In a multidistrict litigation products liability case involving groundwater contamination by a gasoline additive, the Southern District of New York allowed the plaintiff to pursue punitive damages under a commingled product theory. 302 The court explained the 298RESTATEMENT (SECOND ) OF TORTS \u00a7 431 cmt. b (1965). The key difference is that the Restatement would also impose a proximate cause inquiry whereby the significance of the contribution is used as a threshold for holding a defendant liable. Id. \u00a7 431 cmt. a. By contrast, the contributing factor test would appear to je ttison proximate cause inquiry and hol d any contributing cause liable so long as it meets the de minimis bar. 299PROSSER AND KEETON , supra note 92, \u00a7 189, at 635. 301Id. (citing Richard W. Wright, Causation in Tort Law , 73 C ALIF. L. REV. 1788-94 earlier ruling on commingled product theory). N O R T H W E S T E R N U N I V E R S I T Y L A W R E V I E W 528 commingled product theory by contrasting it with the substantial factor test: What sets the commingled theory apart from the traditional theory of causation . . . is that the [plaintiff] need not show that each individual defendant's contribution, taken alone , would have caused an injury. . . . defendant's MTBE contributed to the commingled product that caused the injury.303 Aside from the products liability context and its application to resolve an indeterminate defendant problem,304 this description comes closest to the contributing factor test that the Asarco court described. Importantly, the spirit of the commingled product th eory appears consistent with the contributing factor test; both are attempts to modify traditional causal standards for more complex tort situa tions that otherwise impose difficult causal burdens on the plaintiff. In th is way, the theory supports the application of the contributing factor test to the difficult-to-prove cases of long-term harm. In sum, a survey of the torts literature suggests that the contributing factor test, despite the paucity of citations provided by adopting courts like Asarco , does have roots in tort doctrine and is a legitimate starting point for determining causation in natural resource damages cases. The challenge for the courts is to more plainly describe the dimensions of the test they mean to adopt or reject. Without that, c onfusion and inconsis tency among courts will most certainly arise. Notably, this call for clarity applies regardless of whether courts are choosing to adopt the substantial factor or the contributing factor test. Depending on the contours of the test, in fact, they could well be one and the same. 2. Avoiding Undue Limitations.\u2014 While the contributing factor test has some appeal for resolving the cau sation challenges described in this Article, no court has considered its application in the oil spill context. The two courts that have adopted it were addressing fairly classic CERCLA cases involving multiple polluters and a mixture of toxins in the release. In doing so, these courts have not only failed to clarify the test, but they have also introduced conditions that would ma ke the test problematic in the oil spill context or for long-term ecologi cal harms more generally. In the 303In re MTBE, 643 F. Supp. 2d at 464 (some alterations in original) (quoting In re MTBE, 644 F. Supp. 2d at 319) (interna l quotation marks omitted). 304Whereas CERCLA traditionally imposes joint and several liability, the commingled product theory imposes only several liability determined by \"the defendant's share of the market at the time of the injury.\" In re MTBE , 644 F. Supp. 2d. at 320 (quoting (S.D.N.Y. 2008)). In addition, the commingled product theory presumes multiple defendant s who have produced the same product. See In re MTBE , 591 F. Supp. 2d at 274-75. In the natural resource damage context, as noted above, there may or may not be multiple defendants and there may be multiple kinds of toxins at issue. 108:475 (2014) The Long-Term Tort 529 future, courts would be wise to avoid these limitations, unless deliberate restrictions on liability were intended. The first undue restriction was introduced by the Asarco court when it adopted the contributing factor test only for commingled releases.305 On its face, then, the court would appear to reject the application of the contributing factor test to a single substance release like an oil spill. The court, of course, did not consider harms from oil spills, much less long-term harms. If it had, the court might not have drawn a difference between commingled and noncommingled waste. 306 The injury lag times associated with long-term harm increase the likeli hood that the harm is due, at least in part, to the synergistic impacts of multiple compounding ecosystem stressors. In that sense, long-term harms are just as much a product of \"commingled\" stressors as the harm resulting from the classic commingled waste. The second undue restriction introduced by the Asarco court is the suggestion that plaintiffs prove that \"at least some of the injury would have occurred if only the Defendant's amount of release had occurred.\" 307 To the extent the court would require trustees to show that the amount of oil released would be capable of causing the alleged injury on its own, this aspect of the test could be problema tic in its failure to account for synergistic impacts. In most situations, requiring the defe ndant's release to be capable of injury on its own poses little problem and even has some intuitive appeal. For long-term injuries, however, considering the release in a vacuum may not fully appreciate the synergistic nature of the release in combination with other stressors. By even asking if a defendant's release would have created harm on its own, the test seems to invite the possibility that stressors causing harm can be separated out from one another. In that sense, the test as described by the Asarco court might incorrectly encourage courts to consider the release in isolation and not the greater context of the release. To be sure, any given toxic stressor might not cause ecologically significant injury if the ecosystem were otherwise robust and able to absorb some shock. 308 That same amount of toxic input to an already stressed ecosystem might, however, be enough to cause significant population declines. 309 In other words, background stressor and synergistic impacts matter. For this reason, the test as articulated by the Asarco court 305Coeur D'Alene Tribe v. No. CV91-0342NEJL, CV96-0122NEJL, 2001 WL 34139603, at *5 (D. Idaho Mar. 306See accompanying note 217. 3072001 WL 34139603, at *5. 308See Craig, A Match Made in Hell, supra note 12, at 1886-87 (describing resilience theory and \"an ecosystem's ability to absorb change a nd persist in function and relationships\"). 309Id. N O R T H W E S T E R N U N I V E R S I T Y L A W R E V I E W 530 does not appear to be responsive to the core causal challenges of long-term harms. In addition, recall that the purpose of CERCLA's aggressive joint and several liability scheme was avoiding th e divisibility problems when there are multiple tortfeasors whose hazardous substances have commingled in some unknown way and have been rel eased into the environment. To require trustees seeking natural resource damages to prove that the long-term harm would have been caused by the oil acting in isolation simply reverses the logic of the modified liability scheme. What this means is that courts adopting the contributing factor test should avoid articulating the test as requiring proof of harm by the defendant's release alone. The relevant inquiry may simply be whether the evidence shows that the release, alone or in combination with other stressors, contributed to the harm. Th at is the essence of the contributing factor test and the problematic language might simply be an unnecessary remnant of more traditional formulations of the substantial factor test. B. Borrowing from Toxic Torts Even if courts were to adopt the contributing factor test without some of the undue and problematic limita tions discussed here, courts will still need to put a finer point on exactly what a trustee plaintiff will be required to prove. To assist in that endeavor, courts may be wise to borrow from the area of toxic torts. Many of the distinguishing characteristics of long-term natural resource damages claims are also true of toxic tort cases. 310 In particular, natural resource damages claims raise issues of sublethal injuries, long latency periods, multiple causal agents, and aggregate risk. Likewise, toxic tort plaintiffs tend to suffer from disease, fertility problems, or some other chronic injury. 311 In addition, toxic tort injuries often involve long latency periods.312 In some cases, the time from exposure to the manifestation of 310Compare TOXIC TORTS , supra note 234, at 230 (describing the distinguishing characteristics of harm caused by asbestos), with Rabin, supra note 151, at 27-32 (discussing the distinguishing characteristics of toxic tort and environmental harm cases). 311Rabin, supra note 151, at 27-32; Jean Macchiaroli Eggen, Toxic Reproductive and Genetic Hazards in the Workplace: Challenging the Myths of the Tort and Workers' Compensation Systems , 60 F ORDHAM L. REV. 843, 864 (1992) (discussing the difficulty of proving causation for infertility issues allegedly resulting from toxic exposure in the workplace). 312TOXIC TORTS , supra note 234, at 228-30. While in many nontoxic tort cases the effect almost immediately follows the cause, long latency periods ar e the primary reason that proving causation is so difficult in toxic tort cases. See, e.g. , RESTATEMENT (THIRD ) OF TORTS : LIABILITY FOR PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL HARM \u00a7 28 cmt. c, at 402 (2010) (\"[T]he causes of some diseases, especially those with significant latency periods, are generally much less well understood. Even known causes for certain diseases may explain only a fraction of the incidenc e of such diseases, with the remainder due to unknown causes.\"). 108:475 (2014) The Long-Term Tort 531 the disease can range from twenty to fifty years.313 And, like the problems of synergistic causes giving rise to long-term ecological harms, toxic tort cases may also involve multiple agents, capable of causing harm when acting alone or in concert with other stressors. 314 Finally, and relatedly, some toxic tort cases raise the problem of aggregate risk, where a disease might be the result of multiple exposures to the same or different toxic products over time. 315 Not surprisingly, toxic tort cases are notorious for raising causation challenges. Indeed, the difficulty of proving causation is often the defining characteristic setting toxic torts apart from regular torts.316 Notably, within the toxic torts literature and jurisprudence, courts and scholars recognize that deviation from traditional causal paradigms is both necessary and appropriate. 317 It is necessary to pr event injustice to injured plaintiffs who would otherwise be left without a re medy. It is appropriate given the flexibility of tort law to serve the demands of justice. In light of the similarities between long-term ecological injuries and toxic torts, the remainder of this Ar ticle will consider whether alternative tort principles used in toxic tort law are appropriate paradigms for proving causation in the natural resource damages context. In particular, this Part considers how the differentiation of ge neral and specific causation within the toxic torts framework might clarif y the plaintiff's evidentiary burden for natural resource damages claims. In doing so, this Part examines the risk-of-injury approach to satisfyin g the substantial factor test and considers the applicability of burden- shifting paradigms that seek to ease the plaintiff's causal burden. Ultimately, this Part concludes that some combination of these tools might be a good fit for proving long-term ecological injuries. 1. Proving General and Specific Causation.\u2014 In toxic tort cases, the causation-in-fact inquiry is typically framed as two issues: general causation and specific causation. 318 General causation addresses whether 313TOXIC TORTS , supra note 234, at 230. 314Id. at 159. 315See Susan R. Poulter, Science and Toxic Torts: Is There a Rational Solution to the Problem of Causation? , 7 H IGH TECH.

Liddell, The Interaction of Asbestos and Smoking in Lung Cancer , 45 A NNALS OCCUPATIONAL HYGIENE 341, 342 (2001) (examining the history and evidence to present \"the most reliable assessme nt of the interaction between asbestos exposure and cigarette smoking in the causation of lung cancer\"). 316TOXIC TORTS , supra note 234, at 159 (\"With the rise of toxic torts . . . proof of causation has become one of the most complex and cont roversial aspects of tort liability.\"). 317For a sampling of the literature providing sugges tions for relaxing the causal paradigm in the area of toxic torts, see Berger, supra note 223; Gold, supra note 171; and Allen Rostron, Beyond Market Share Liability: A Theory of Proportional Liability for Nonfungible Products , 52 UCLA L.

N O R T H W E S T E R N U N I V E R S I T Y L A W R E V I E W 532 the substance at issue is capable of cau sing the type of harm alleged in the case.319 Does smoking cause lung cancer? Scientific evidence tending to prove general causation might include some combination of epidemiological studies, clinical trials, animal studies, time trend data, biological mechanism research, or in vitro studies.320 Assuming a plaintiff can successfully establish that the offending agent is a possible cause of injury, th e plaintiff must then prove specific causation. Specific causation asks the more pointed question: whether exposure to the substance at issue caused the plaintiff's injury.321 Specific causation requires linking a particular injury to the defendant's release. Did the plaintiff develop lung cancer from smoking? Because multiple agents might be theoretically capable of causing an alleged injury, the process of proving specific causation often involves a differential diagnosis whereby the plaintiff \"rules out\" alternative causes. 322 The heart of proving specific causation is showing the plaintiff's exposure to the toxic agent.323 The plaintiff must also show that the dose (the amount of exposure) was capable of causing the alleged harm.324 In the oil spill context, proving general causation would require showing that exposure to oil is capable of causing the alleged injury\u2014e.g., disrupting the reproductive capacity of sea otters. Proving specific causation would require showing that sea otters were exposed to oil in doses capable of causing injury and th at the oil came from the defendant's release. By itself, the general and specific causation framework does not ease the causal burden so much as clarify it. Indeed, the epidemiologic evidence required to satisfactorily prove specific causation is simply a form of the 319See id. at 193. 320See id. at 188 (citing J OSEPH SANDERS , BENDICTIN ON TRIAL 45-61 (1998) (describing the types of evidence used to prove causation in toxic tort cases involving Bendictin, a morning sickness pill given to pregnant women and late r alleged to cause birth defects)); see also DeLuca v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., 911 F.2d 941, 954 (3d Cir. 1990) (dis cussing the persuasiveness of epidemiological studies in showing general causation for Bendictin litigation). 321TOXIC TORTS , supra note 234, at 193. 322See id. at 192-93; see also Cavallo v.

If other possible causes of an injury cannot be ruled out, or at least the probability of their contribution to causation minimized, then the 'more likely than not' threshold for proving causation may not be met.\"). 323See RESTATEMENT (THIRD ) OF TORTS : LIABILITY FOR PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL HARM \u00a7 28 cmt c., at 405 (2010) (noting that in some cases th e general and specific causation inquiries might be merged, but \"[i]n any case, plaintiff's exposure to the toxic agent must be established\"). 324See, e.g. , Bernard D. Goldstein, Toxic Torts: The Devil Is in the Dose , 16 J.L. & POL'Y 551 (2008); see also Mancuso v. Consol. Edison Co. of N.Y. Inc., 56 F. Supp. 2d 391, 403 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (\"A fundamental tenet of toxicology is that the 'dose makes the poison' and that all chemical agents, including water, are harmful if consumed in large qua ntities, while even the most toxic substances are harmless in minute quantities.\"). 108:475 (2014) The Long-Term Tort 533 classic preponderance of the evidence standard.325 It is not clear, therefore, that the framework alters the underlying and traditional causation paradigm.326 Rather, it simply provides a formula for applying that traditional paradigm to a toxic tort context.327 If this general and specific causati on framework were applied to the natural resource damages context, the largest hurdle to proving causation would be providing evidence of specific causation. It is conceivable, in other words, that government trustees could obtain evidence that exposure to oil, or even weathered oil with an altered toxic profile, was capable of causing harm. Proving specific causation, however, would ostensibly require some understanding of exposure pathways, biological mechanisms connecting exposure to injury, and ca use-effect relationships between various resource elements within the affected ecosystem. In this sense, the complication of proving specific causation is amplified in the natural resource damages context. There are two reasons for this. First, our research and understanding of how the human body works is more advanced than our understanding of the feedback mechanisms and cause-effect relationship within the marine ecosystem in which oil spills take place. Second, the exposure pathways and biological mechanisms underlying species disease and demographic collapse are magnitudes more complex in the natural resource damages context than in harm to a single human plaintiff. The Pacific herring fishery collapse in Prince William Sound just three years after the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill is a good example. That collapse was a catastrophic injury for which there is still little definitive evidence linking it to the Exxon spill. There is strong circumstantial evidence and there is some evidence demonstrating an expos ure pathway, but the time lag and the complex biological mechanisms involved make it a difficult puzzle to solve with certainty. Proving injury to natural resources involves not just proof that a particular toxin caused a particular disease in a single individual. Rather, in the context of oil spills, showing harm to natural resources involves understanding causal relationships between an oil spill and long-term species demographics when the exposure pathways are both direct and indirect and when the interdependencies of species might disperse the 325See Poulter, supra note 315, at 229 & n.189; David Rosenberg, The Causal Connection in Mass Exposure Cases: A \"Public Law\" Vision of the Tort System , 97 H ARV. L. REV. 849 (1984). 326See, e.g., Sindell v. Abbott Labs., 607 P.2d 924, 928 (Cal. 1980) (citations omitted) (\"We begin with the proposition that, as a general rule, the im position of liability depends upon a showing by the plaintiff that his or her injuries were caused by th e act of the defendant or by an instrumentality under the defendant's control. The rule applies whether th e injury resulted from an accidental event or from the use of a defective product.\"). 327See Alani Golanski, General Causation at a Crossroads in Toxic Tort Cases , 108 P ENN. ST. L. REV. 479, 486 (2003) (describing general and specific causation as a process of plying apart the traditional causal inquiry into two levels). N O R T H W E S T E R N U N I V E R S I T Y L A W R E V I E W 534 direct impacts of a spill well into the food web.328 That means there is not likely to be definitive evidence that o il exposure to herring roe in year one is capable of causing the Pacific herring fishery to collapse in year three,329 or that the exposure to chemical disp ersants used in the wake of the BP Gulf Oil Spill could cause some yet-unknown long-term injury.330 A causation paradigm that requires definitive proof of specific causation is not likely to serve the broader goals of tort law any more than traditional paradigms. In that sense, we might be cautious about applying wholesale the general framework for pr oving toxic tort claims to oil spills\u2014namely, the requirement that plaintiffs show some combination of evidence proving general and specific causation. And yet, the general and specific causation framework is quite useful in focusing the discussion of what evidentiary proof a government trustee would have to offer in order to recover damages for long-term ecological injuries. 2. Applying a Risk-of-Injury Approach.\u2014 If we return to the ruminations of Judge Calabresi and accept the premise that market deterrence goals are served by assigning liability to the cheapest cost avoider, some causal link between the accident and the injury is necessary. 331 That causal link, however, does not have to take the form of a traditional but-for relationship.332 Rather, Calabresi explains that the more relevant inquiry is whether the defe ndant's actions increased the chances that the injury would occur: \"There is a causal link between an act or activity and an injury when we conc lude on the basis of the available evidence that the recurrence of that act or activity will increase the chances that the injury will also occur.\" 333 In other words, a risk-of-injury analysis is the key.334 328See supra Part I.B. for discussion of complicated and interdependent relationships that drive ecosystem function. 329See discussion supra Part I.B and notes 114-16. 330See Seth Borenstein, Gulf Oil Spill Dispersants 'Sticking Ar ound,' Long-Term Effects Remain Unclear, H UFFINGTON POST (Jan. 26, 2011, 5:32 PM), http ://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/27/ gulf-oil-spill-chemical-d_n_814749.html; see also Alice C.

In those cases, the plaintiff is typically a long-time smoker who brings an action against his employer for asbestos-related injuries or wrongful death. 335 Like claims related to long-term ecological injuries, the smoker-asbestos cases raise issues involving synergistic causes, scientific uncertainty, and long latency periods. 336 In one such case, Rutherford v. Owens-Illinois, Inc. , the Supreme Court of California considered what type of evidentiary showing the plaintiff had to make under the substantia l factor test in order to recover for asbestos-related injuries. The court bega n by noting that the plaintiff had the burden of establishing causation and that in the California courts this meant showing that the defective products supplied by the defendant were a substantial factor in bringing about the injury. 337 The court continued with a detailed examination of the evidentiary proof that a plaintiff would have to submit in order to meet its burden. In particular, the plaintiff would need to show exposure to the defendant's product. 338 The plaintiff did not have to show, however, that fibers from the defendant's product were the actual cause of the lung cancer.339 To that, the court remarked that \"[p]laintiffs cannot be expected to prove the scientifically unknown details of carcinogenesis, or trace the unknowable path of a given asbestos fiber.\"340 Rather, to prove causation, the plaintiff only needed to show that exposure to a particular product was a substantial factor contributing to the plaintiff's risk of developing cancer. 341 The court concluded by reminding the parties that \"[t]he substantial factor standa rd is a relatively broad one, requiring only that the contribution of the individu al cause be more than negligible or theoretical.\"342 Given the similarity between the California substantial factor test and the contributing factor test, the Rutherford court's treatment of the causation standard in the smoking-asbestos context is particularly relevant to the problem of provi ng long-term ecological harms. The risk-of-injury analysis has also been adopted by several courts in the medical malpractice area.343 The leading case from the Washington move away from traditional showings of physical injury to support recovery); id. at 1679 n.17 (assembling the toxic tort literature on risk-of-injury theory). e.g. , Rutherford v. 2d 357, 368 (Ill. 2002) (recognizing and joining trend toward \"allowing compensation for increased risk of future injury as long as it can be shown to a N O R T H W E S T E R N U N I V E R S I T Y L A W R E V I E W 536 Supreme Court, Herskovits v. Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound , considered whether a physician coul d be held liable for professional negligence when he failed to timely diagnose lung cancer and thereby statistically decreased the pl aintiff's chance of survival.344 The court adopted a risk-of-injury analysis. Otherwise, the court noted, a defendant might be \"completely insulated because of uncertainties as to the consequences of his negligent conduct.\" 345 If courts were to adopt a risk-o f-injury analysis for long-term ecological injuries, government truste es seeking natural resource damages would be required to show that the injured resource was exposed to the defendant's oil and that oil exposur e increased the risk of the injury alleged. This later showing would lik ely require some evidence of general causation, namely that the oil is cap able of causing the harm alleged. To tie the risk-of-injury analysis back to the general and specific causation framework, we might consider whether courts that adopt a risk-of-injury threshold are effectively requiri ng plaintiffs to satisfy the two-part inquiry. It would appear so. As for general causation, plaintiffs must show that the defendant's product is capable of causing the type of harm alleged. Without that showing, plaintiffs could not meet the risk-of-injury test. In other words, if the defendant's produc t is not capable as a general matter of causing the type of harm alleged it cannot be said to increase the risk of that harm. Similarly, the risk-of-injury threshold requires plaintiffs to satisfy the specific causation inquiry, albeit by less traditional means. To that end, plaintiffs prove a causal link between the injury and the defendant's product by showing exposure to defendant's product. Importantly, the risk-of-injury analysis does not require plaintiffs to show specific causation by demonstrating exactly how exposure to defendant's product caused the particular harm. Plain tiffs simply have to show that the defendant's product increased the risk of injury. That alternative formulation of specific causation is necessary, as the courts note, because the scientific complexity and uncertainty of demonstrating precise causal pathways would otherwise insulate defendants from liability for harms caused after long latency periods and synergistic causes. In the risk-of-injury cases, in other words, courts are necessarily taking a broader view of specific causation. At the same time, the courts are ensuring that plaintiffs are proving a causal link by satisfying both parts of the general and specific causation framework. reasonable degree of certainty that the defendant's wrongdoing created the increased risk\"); Herskovits v. Grp. Health Coop. of Puget Sound, 664 P.2d 474 (Wash. 1983) (en banc) (adopting a risk-of-injury analysis); see also V ICTOR E. SCHWARTZ ET AL ., PROSSER , WADE AND SCHWARTZ 'S TORTS CASES AND MATERIALS 281-84 (12th ed. 2010) (assembling the risk-of-injury cases in the medical malpractice context). 344664 P.2d at 474. 345Id. at 477 (quoting 392 A.2d 1280, 1287 (Pa. 1978)). 108:475 (2014) The Long-Term Tort 537 Notably, the risk-of-injury analysis allows a court to tailor the requirements of specific causation to long-term natural resource damages. In that sense, the general and specific causation framework could be a workable approach for long-term ecological injuries if approached in combination with a risk-of-injury threshold. There is, of course, nothing magical about the general and specific causation framework, and it is not an indispensable part of the causation inquiry. In fact, courts that apply the risk-of-injury threshold are not necessarily discussing it in the context of the general and specific causation framework. In Rutherford , for example, the California Supreme Court adopted a risk-of-injury analysis as part of the substantial factor test. 346 It is useful, however, to test how these various approaches fit together and note that they are consistent. In that way, courts that are otherwise inclined to appl y the general and specific causation framework to toxic tort-like cases can c ontinue to do so and still approach the specific causation inquiry through a risk-of-injury threshold. 3. Shifting the Burden of Proof.\u2014 As noted, problems would arise if courts were to adopt wholesale the general and specific causation framework without matching the needs of the specific causation inquiry to the challenges of the long-term tort. In that way, the general-specific causation framework does not by itself resolve the causal difficulties faced by trustees because the issue of prov ing specific causation looms large. While one way to alleviate this difficulty is to adopt a risk-of-injury approach, another way is through burden shifting. In particular, if courts were willing to shift the burden of proof in cases where trustees are claiming long-term natural resource injuries, a general and specific causation paradigm might prove viable in its current form. In fact, one could imagine a framework by which trus tees were required to rule in oil as a possible causal agent under a general causation inquiry and then defendants were given the opportunity to demonstrate that another specific cause was more likely the actual cause. Notably, the Rutherford case is actually a burden-shifting case at its core. In that smoker-asbestos case, the California Supreme Court was asked to decide whether the trial court erred in giving a burden-shifting instruction on the issue of causation. 347 Recall that plaintiffs ordinarily carry the burden of proof on causation. In that case, the trial court shifted the burden to the defendant on the theo ry that the case presented potentially 346See Rutherford v. Owens-Ill., Inc., 941 P.2d 1203 (Cal. 1997); see also Shelly Brinker, Comment, Opening the Door to the Indeterminate Plaintiff: An Analysis of the Causation Barriers Facing Environmental Toxic Tort Plaintiffs , 46 UCLA L.

Supp. 247 (D. Utah 1984), rev'd on other grounds , 816 F.2d 1417 (10th Cir. 1987), where the court applied the subs tantial factor approach to resolve plaintiffs' allegations of injury from exposure to radiation). 347Rutherford , 941 P.2d at 1206. N O R T H W E S T E R N U N I V E R S I T Y L A W R E V I E W 538 insurmountable barriers to proving causation in light of the long latency periods and exposure to multiple form s and brands of asbestos products with varying degrees of toxicity.348 Ultimately, the California Supreme Court concluded that a burden-shif ting instruction was unnecessary given that the plaintiff could satisfy the substantial factor test by simply showing that the defendant's prod uct contributed in some way to the increased risk of injury. 349 The causation test was lenient and did not require the plaintiff to prove \"with medical exactitude that fibers from a particular defendant's asbestos-containing products were those, or among those, that actually began the cellular process of malignancy.\" 350 In other words, the application of the risk-of-injury threshold to satisfy an otherwise lenient substantial factor test was enough to afford the plaintiff a reasonable chance of recovery even when synergistic cau ses and long latency periods were involved. 351 If the substantial factor test (or c ontributing factor test, as the case may be) proves a burdensome standard, and otherwise threatens to leave trustees \"remediless\" 352 for long-term ecological injuries, a burden-shifting framework might be justified. In other difficult-to-prove cases, courts and Congress have seen fit to shift the bu rden of proving causation to the defendant. 353 Similarly, in some countries like China the courts 348Id. at 1227. 349Id. at 1219-20; see also Lineaweaver Insulation Co., 37 Cal. Rptr. 2d 902 (Ct. App. 1995) (finding that burden shifting is inappropr iate and unnecessary in asbestos cases). 350Rutherford 861 F.2d 1453, 1 468-69 (10th Cir. 1988) (applying Nebraska law and holding that in concurrent cause cases \"where the plaintiff can show that a defendant's asbestos dust caused some harm and possibly substantial harm but cannot show the relative contribution of that defendant to the overall harm\" the burden shifts to the defendant to prove that exposure to the defendant's product was not sufficient to be a substantial factor in causing the harm). 352In the classic burden-shifting case of Summers v. Tice , 199 P.2d 1 (Cal. 1948) (en banc), the fundamental justification for shifting the burden wa s that all defendants might escape liability and the plaintiff left \"remediless.\" Id. at 4. 353Congress has provided burden-shifting frameworks in a number of different situations, including workers' compensation cases\u2014 see, e.g. , Rainey v. Workers' Comp., 517 F.3d 632, 634-35 (2d Cir. 2008) (clarifying that, pursuant to the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 et seq., once claimants have made out a prima facie case by establishing that the claimant \"suffered harm, and that workplace conditions . . . could have caused, aggravated, or accelerated the harm ,\" even when there are preexisting conditions or prior conditions, the burden of production shifts to employers to rebut a presumption of causation (quoting Am. Stevedoring Ltd. v. Marinelli, 248 F.3d 54, 64-65 (2nd Ci r. 2001)))\u2014and discrimination cases\u2014 see, e.g. , Univ. of Tex. Sw. Ctr. v. Nassar, 133 S. Ct. 2517 (2013 ) (clarifying that the Civil Rights Act of 1991 codified the burden-shifting and lower causation framework for T itle VII discrimination claims based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin); McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973) (explaining that in Title VII cases, once a clai mant has made out a prima facie case of racial discrimination, the burden shifts \"to the employer to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee's rejection\"). In addition, courts have creatively allowed burden shifting to promote fairness where innocent plai ntiffs would otherwise be unabl e to prove causation because of uncertainties as to particular causal pathways. See, e.g. , Sindell v. Abbott Labs ., 607 924, 928 (Cal. 108:475 (2014) The Long-Term Tort 539 categorically shift the burden of disproving causation to the polluter in environmental cases.354 4. Tying the Pieces of the Old Together to Form the New.\u2014 In the end, some combination of a lenient substantial factor test, a risk-of-injury analysis that is tied more to general causation than specific causation, and burden-shifting frameworks when appr opriate would assist courts in resolving the causal challenges of long-term ecological injuries. Specifically, if we follow the logic of Judge Calabresi and accept that establishing a causal link is key to serving market deterrence, and if we follow the analysis of the smoker-asbestos cases like Rutherford v. Owens- Illinois Inc. , we might arrive at a causation inquiry for long-term ecological injuries that looks something like this: First, the touchstone for proving causation is a relaxed form of the substantial factor test, which some c ourts in the natural resource damages area have labeled as the contributing factor test. Because this test is flexible at its core, the test requires only that the oil spill was one factor (not necessarily the factor) that contributed to the alleged long-term injury. Second, to prove that the oil spill was a contributing factor, the government trustees must prove that the injured resource was exposed to the oil and that oil exposure would increase the risk of the injury alleged. The trustees need not show the particular biological pathway or mechanism by which the oil actually caused the a lleged harm. This test assigns liability even if there are other contributing causes or background stressors that have combined to create the alleged harm. Finally, if in a given case this framework would systematically preclude recovery for long-term harms, the court may see fit to invoke a burden-shifting framework. Such a move, however, would more likely be reserved for a decision made by the legislature or after empirical evidence regarding systematic undercompensation of long-term harms is available. 1980) (holding that once a plaintiff joins the manufact urers of a substantial share of DES that the plaintiff's mother may have taken, the burden shifts to the manufacturers to prove that they could not have produced the injury-causing product); Summers, 199 P.2d at 3-4 (holding that the lower court properly shifted the burden to the defendants to absolve themselves where both defendants negligently shot at the plaintiff and one pellet entered the pl aintiff's eye). Scholars have also proposed burden shifting when there are extraord inary challenges preventing plai ntiffs from proving causation. See Alexandra B. Klass, Pesticides, Children's Health Policy, and Common Law Tort Claims , 7 M INN. J.L. SCI. & TECH. 89, 92, 136 (2005) (suggesting that in cases where the plaintiff can prove the pesticide manufacturer \"failed to conduct reas onably available testing to gather currently unavailable scientific evidence on the issue of causation\" the burden should shift to the defendant to rebut the presumption that \"the defendant's failure to conduct the testin g was negligent, and that the testing would have resulted in data not already available that would cau se a reasonable manufacturer to take the pesticide off the market or use a less harmful design\"). 354See Adam Moser & Tseming Yang, Environmental Tort Litigation in China , 41 E NVTL . L. REP. NEWS & ANALYSIS 10,895, 10,897 (2011) (discussing Articles 65 and 66 of the new China Tort Law, which \"unambiguously state that th e burden of proof in environmental tort actions is on the polluter\"). N O R T H W E S T E R N U N I V E R S I T Y L A W R E V I E W 540 CONCLUSION As scientific studies in the wake of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill demonstrate, long-term ecological injuries are increasingly foreseeable. For oil spills and toxic substance releases, Congress expressly provided a mechanism for recovering for long-term injuries: natural resource damages. There are several factors, however, that undermine trustees' ability to recover long-term injuries. Some are complications of Mother Nature herself. Some are complications of our legal system. This Article is the first to combine the scientific and legal literature to provide an in-depth study of the causation challenges of proving long-term ecological harms. Using the long-term studies done in the wake of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill, this Article establis hes the causation difficulties of proving long-term injuries and demonstrates why a new causal paradigm is necessary. In particular, this Article shows why, in the face of a new scientific paradigm, traditional causation standards\u2014e.g., the but-for test or the classic form of the substantia l factor test\u2014will exclude otherwise legitimate claims for long-term injuries. This Article provides the academic foundation for a suitable causation paradigm. First, it demonstrates that an alternative paradigm is permissible under the statutory framework, is needed within the jurisprudence, and is desired to meet the central tenets of tort law. Second, it surveys tort principles and the toxic torts literature to offer a solution. Strangely, the seemingly obvious overlap between two worlds\u2014one contemplating latent injuries to human bodies and one examining long-term injuries to ecosystems\u2014has not been the focus of scholarly attention before. While some scholars have examined similar causation problems in toxic tort and mass product liability cases, none have examined the challenges implicated in the context of natural resource damages. Ultimately, while this Article set out in search of a new paradigm for a new problem, in the end the flexibility of tort law and the problems of latent injuries in other cases leave us with an emerging problem that, when approached with care and consideration, can be resolved through a careful combination of existing tools that are meant to alleviate some of the inherent difficulties of proving causation when synergistic causes and long latency periods are involved. To that end, this Article argues that the intuitive nature of the contributing factor test makes it appealing in light of the many varying fact scenarios that are typical in natural resource damages cases. But, if a contributing factor test is more widely applied in the natural resource damages context, courts should clarify the parameters of the test. A meaningful and appropriate test would recognize that natural forces combine with man-made forces to create injuries. Background stressors and synergistic causes are at the heart of the causal challeng es posed by long- term ecological injuries. In addition, the contributing factor test should be 108:475 (2014) The Long-Term Tort 541 applied in combination with a risk -of-injury analysis. Absent a lenient application of the substantial factor test, preferably with a risk-of-injury threshold, a burden-shifting approach might be appropriate. Whatever the precise formulation, it is important to see that tort law is capable of adapting to emerging issues posed by long-term ecological injuries without resorting to legislative reform. That said, legislatures might still consider whether the time and expense of figuring out how to assign liability for long-term harms could or should be avoided entirely. In par ticular, though this Article meets the challenge of proving causation on its ow n terms and explains how tort law is suited to meet those challenges, le gislative reform could simply jettison the causal inquiry. Or, legislatures might simply invoke a multiplier to calculate liability for long-term harms as some fraction of the still-complicated but more measurable short-term impacts. Indeed, trustees might look to the amount and type of oil spill as well as other defining factors related to the sensitivity of the marine ecosystem impacted to create a liability matrix. The point here is that the causal inquiry is only central to the question of redress so long as proof of causation is part of the statutory framework. This Article seeks a tort-based solution for overcoming causal barriers to the recovery of long-term ecological injuries. Other work might fairly consider innovations in the statutor y or regulatory framework to address causation or other barriers. "}
