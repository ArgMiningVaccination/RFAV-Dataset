One area in particular that chiropractic care can provide benefits is to your immune system. Recent research has shown that chiropractic care can help boost the immune system in numerous ways. The first thing to understand before we jump into how the immune system can be boosted by chiropractic care is the role of the spinal cord in the human body. The spinal cord is central to both chiropractic care and the immune system, operating as a means of transfer for messenger molecules that activate immune responses. The central and peripheral nervous systems all branch off from that main spinal cord, which is enclosed in the spine. For chiropractors, ensuring that these channels are maintained are of paramount importance. As such, making sure that the spinal cord is kept free flowing allows those messenger molecules to communicate to the immune system to release those molecules as a response to illness. In this way, a chiropractor making sure that the nervous system stays open allows for strengthened the immune system. Another way that chiropractic care can be beneficial for the immune system is in regulating the endocrine system. Since the previous way chiropractic care can help regulate the nervous system is indirect, chiropractic care helping the endocrine system is, in a way, an indirect indirect benefit. The endocrine system\u2014and its principal agents epinephrine, nor-epinephrine, and cortisol\u2014is responsible for many of the messages that go back and forth. If this is kept in check\u2014which can be done by such chiropractic actions as subluxation\u2014then the immune system will have a boost as well. Though these are just two benefits, it has to be remembered that in terms of immune health, nothing beats vaccinations. Chiropractic treatment can help keep channels that signal an immune response, but in terms of that immune response being strong, chiropractors can't touch that. Indeed, in recent years numerous chiropractors have come out and claimed that their practice can keep you healthy without having to resort to vaccines and medication. This is patently false and, in a way, irresponsible. In the end, chiropractic care can boost immune system, mostly through indirect ways. For direct immune strengtheners, normal diet, vaccines, and medications are the only proven method. Yet, like all other things in the body, channels that communicate the need to start up an immune response get clogged up. Here, and only here, can chiropractic care come in handy.
