Motion passed. 4: VICE PRESIDENT'S REPORT Vice President Newburn welcomed new Board Members Rene Cantu, Katie Coombs, and Tim Hughes to the Board . 5: SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT Superintendent Ebert reported that Nevada participated in the Recognizing Inspirational School Employees (RISE) award , a federal award which honors classified school employees. After receiving multiple nominations, Governor Steve Sisolak selected Mr . Victor Garcia -Mendez , an English Language paraprofessional in the Carson City School District , and Ms. Kim Ruiz , an instructional aide in the Humboldt County School District. Other outstanding finalists included Ms. Cas Woods , a special education instructional aide in the Storey County School District ; Ms. Doraisabel Garcia , an instructional aide in the Clark County School District ; and Ms. Dan nielle Buckalew , who works in the Comp rehensive Li fe Skills Specia l Education Unit in Humboldt County School District. Superintendent Ebert congratulated awardees and nominees and thanked the efforts of nominators and NDE Educatio n Programs Professional KellyLynn Charles for their work to uplift the staff that create the safe, healthy , and welcoming environments that all children need to succeed and grow. Superintendent Ebert also congratulated Ms. Kristen Tester of Winnemucca Junio r High School, who was awarded the Nevada History Teacher of the Year award; she was recognized by the Gilder Lehrman Ins titute of American History for her outstanding instruction and leadership in the field of American Hist ory. Superintendent Ebert reported that educators have been prioritized for vaccination, and many rural districts have completed vacc ination of their educators and staff. She noted that the Commission on School Funding met on December 18, 2020 and January 8 , 2021 , continuing their discussion on optimal funding. The Com mission has outlined that optimal funding will occur in funding stages: restoration and maint enance, adequate, and optimal. The February 4th and 5th meetings of the Commission will continue to review potential revenue sources to develop optimal funding. The Governor 's recommended budget included a phase impl ementation of the Pupil -Centered Funding Plan , as initial plans for implementation could not foresee the economic crisis caused by the COVID -19 pandemic. Phase one implementation for biennium 2021 -2023 will include State revenues currently distri buted by the Nevada Department of Education, making up base funding and State -funded grants. Local revenues will be added in phase two implementation during the 2023 -25 biennium. This phased implementation will allow districts to manage resources and meet the needs of their communities. Page 4 of 17 Superintendent Ebert highlighted that the 81st Legislative Session would begin virtually on February 1st, 2021 . She noted that the Department does not file its own bills ; bills are filed by the Governor 's Office on behalf of the Department, with additional opportunities for L egislators or Legislative Committees to file further bills on the Department 's behalf. Six bills have been pre -filed for the Department . Assembly Bill ( AB) 19: Standards Streamline provides clarity on the social studies high school diploma requirement and removes the codification of standards in the Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) . This keeps the regulatory process in place for the Board to approve standards while honor ing teacher feedback to publish standards with graphics and diagrams . Senate B ill (SB) 36: Crisis Management adds a member from the county board of health or other organization to a school district's crises and emergency response planning team . It also expands the definition in the Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) of disease to in clude an epidemic. This bill was created due to feedback from our health care providers during COVID -19. AB 38: Work -Based Learning and Perkins V Alignment increases efficiencies with in rural districts by r emoving the subcommittee requirement and adding \"in consul tation with\" to increase collaboration between employers and education pro viders . It also removes the open meeting law requir ement to increase frequency of collaboration between employers and education provider s and removes assessment requirements and language that implies that work -based learning leads to a diploma . SB 27 : Educator Licensure allow s the Superintendent to delegate investigative authority to qualified staff to process investigations related to licensure. It also proposes allowing the Board to delegate authority to the Department to revoke or s uspend licenses under limited and well -defined circumstances. AB 67 : Discipline continues work first begun under AB 168 (2019) after continued stakeholder engagement. AB 67 clarifies suspension, expulsion, and permanent expulsion . AB 168 (2019) was a school discipline bill that addressed resto rative justice and discip line practices . SB 76 : Education Agility Act works to create efficien cies in the Department 's work. It streamlines legislatively appointed Boards, Commissions, and Task Forces so they may be convened by the Department and Superintendent to focus solely on student outcomes. It removes the Department 's annual report requirement , aligning reporting with the Statewide Plan for the Impr ovement of Pupils (STIP ). Further notable items include removing the Competency -Based Network, as the Blue Ribbon Commission for a Globally Prepared Nevada currently continues this work; and adjusting the organization of the Regional Professional Development Programs. Finally, Superintendent Ebert celebrated that Nevada's 2021 State Teacher of the Year, Ms. Juliana Ur tubey , has been s elected as one of four fin alists to become the 2021 National Teacher of the Year. Member Ortiz asked that the Superintendent provide Legislative updates to the Board thro ugh Session ; Superintendent Ebert assured they would receive weekly updates. 6.

He noted that FOSS had received a low rating by content reviewers , and the materials as written to not meet the demands of next generation science standards. Member Hughes asked for additional information regarding the process for how materials and curriculum are recommended and reviewed. FOSS Next Generation w as pulled from the consent agenda to return with more information during the March meeting. Vice President Newburn moved to approve the consent agenda, barring Item a(iii), FOSS Next Generation. Member Hudson seconded. Motion passed. 8: INFORMATIO N, DISCUSSION , AND POSSIBLE ACTION REGARDING THE DI VERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUS ION WORKGROUP OF THE NEVADA STATE BOARD OF EDUCATIO N Member Hudson provided an update to the Board regarding the January 7, 2021 meeting of the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Workgroup. The Workgroup reviewed the ir efforts in 2020, including the progress made t oward equity across th e digital divide. The Workgroup then discussed next steps and renewed focus moving into 2021 . They decided to pursue the Equity Strategies under STIP Goals 3 and 4 : increase access to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics ) learning and increase participation in college -level and CTE (Career and Technical Education) course work. President Ortiz asked if current participating Members would like to continue to serve on the Workgroup, and if any new Members wou ld like to join. Participating Members Hudson, Ortiz, McAdoo, Workman, and Gallegos remained with the Workgroup , and Mem ber T im Hughes joined. 9: COVID -19 ECONOMIC RELIEF BILL - EDUCATION FUNDING Sarah Nick, Management Analyst to the Superintendent, provided a PowerPoint presentat ion with an overview of the federal Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (CRRSA). President Ortiz asked for clarification regarding GEER (Governor's Emergency Education Relief ) II and the Emergency Assistance to Non -Public Schools ( EANS ) grant . Ms. Nick responded that Nevada received a total allocation of $38,385,542 in GEER II funds ; of those, $19,375,550 are reserved for EANS distribution. Superintendent Ebert noted that the distribution of EANS funds is the purview of the Department, and allocation parameters were still und er development . Eligible uses of EANS funds would include , but is not limited to, educational technology, redevelopment of instructional plans, and initiating and/or maintaining education and support services for remote or hybrid learning or to address learning loss. Member Hughes asked if the Department would provide districts with guidance regarding how best to utilize ESSER (Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief) II funds within their unique district contexts. Superintendent Ebert stated that ESSER II funds are highly flexible, and that any guidance provided by the Department would be driven by STIP values , leading with equity . Member Dockweiler asked whether E SSER II could offse t the Read by Gr ade 3 budget cuts that occurred during the 31st Special Session (2020). Superintendent Ebert responded that districts have a variety of revenue streams , Page 6 of 17 and the Department is working with districts to break down silos, assess their district and programmatic needs holistically , and strategically use flexible funds by the September 30, 2021 deadline. Member Wayne Workman reported that Lyon County School District, like all districts, has unique needs , and has been appreciative of the opportunity to develop flexible operating and funding plans. Member Mike Walker also reported appreciati on for the flexibility to use funds as needed. Member Cantu ask ed how districts were ensuring that equity was the leading factor in the use of funds. Member W orkman noted that Lyon CSD has worked to match funding for equity -driven programs that had their fund ing cut ; Member Walker added that funding is oriented toward student achievement and outcomes. 10: INFORMATIO N AND DISCUSSION REGARDING THE NEVADA ADDENDUM TO THE ELE MENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ACT CONSOLIDATED STATE PLAN (STATE PLAN) FOR THE 2020 -21 SCHOOL YEAR Dr. Jonathan Moore, Deputy Superinte ndent of Student Achievement, and Dr. Patrick Bell , Education Programs Supervisor, Office of Assessment , Data, and Accounting Management, conducted a PowerPoint presentation regarding the Nevada Addendum to the E SEA Cons olidated State Plan for the 2020 -21 School Year. Responding to Member Hughes, Dr. Moore confirmed that additional data would be collected in future, and the information presented reflects a snapshot in time , as understanding an d analy zing data gathered during COVID -19 is highly contextual . NDE is tracking which modalities districts are using and pla n to streamline and systemize the reporting process . Member Cantu asked if there were safegu ards in place to continue mon itoring improvement efforts for targeted support and improvement (TSI) schools during the waiver period . Dr. Moore assured t hat the Department has provided guidance to ensure that students at TSI schools continue to receive support ; the waiver does not cease supports, only th e identification process of TSI schools. Accountability measures include the review of grants and funding requests , as well as continued communication between schools and t he Department regarding the implementation of tertiary supports . Member Hughes asked about the implica tions for TSI or comprehensive support and improve ment (CSI) schools that were paused in the identification process and received federal funds . Dr. Moore noted that schools currently identified w ould not lose any support, including funding of any kind. Regar ding new identifications, Dr. Moore clarified that statewide assessments were last completed in the 2018 -2019 school year, and no new identifications have been made since that school year . Member Workman noted that in addition, districts identify and support lower -performing scho ols. Member Hughes asked if this information could be made more accessible and easily understandable to the public in future . [Convenience Break ] 11: INFORMATION, DISCUSSION AND POSSIBLE ACTION REGARDING THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE READ BY GRADE 3 STATEWIDE ASSESSMENT REQUEST FOR PROCUREMENT This item was pulled from the agenda for consideration during the March meeting. 12: INFORMATION AND DISCUSSION REGARDING THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION FOR A GLOBAL LY PREPARED NEVADA Dr. Jonathan Moore, Deputy Superintendent of Student Achievement , and Dr. Andrew Yoxsimer, Principal of Incline High School, conducted a PowerPoint presentation regarding the Blue Ribbon Commission for a Globally Prepared Nevada. Dr. Yoxsimer noted that a student participati ng in the competency -based education (CBE) program had been scheduled to provide his thoughts on learning under CBE but was unable to attend. A summary of some of the students remarks inclu ded the benefits of performance scales provided up front, and the assignment of projects which students could move through at their own p ace. Learning competencies w ere explicit and clear , so students Page 7 of 17 knew what was expected and what they should master by the end of the school year. Teacher s gave examples of the work students could submit , and some of the strengths of the pr ogram include flexibility, p ace, and the place of instruction. Vice President Newburn noted that school grades may reflect b ehavior and attitude rather than content mastery, making comparisons across classes, teachers, or teachers difficult ; he asked how CBE avoids this model. Dr. Yoxsimer responded that personal competencie s such as work ethic, organization, and time management are separated out , while the proficiency scale retains only the competencies that the student has mastered. Within each level of instruction, there are assignments or projects that must be completed and are graded on a scale of 1 -4. Each project is then averaged and translated to an A -F score. Once fully implemented, competencies will be digitally tracked and translate to what a student has or has not mastered similar ly to a standards -based report card. Vice President Newburn asked how to move away from seat time ; Dr. Yo xsimer noted that by identifying essential standards for K -12, progression will be tracked along mastery of those standards . Students may then move at their own p ace on different subjects. Member H ughes asked the process for moving away from seat time towards CBE. Superintendent Ebert responded that this is one of the charges of the Blue Ribbon Commission , and the Department is in discussion with legislators to facilitate this transition. Member Katie Coombs asked how teachers and parents have responded to implementation. Dr. Yoxsimer explained that there has been s ome disconnect betwee n students ' grades and knowledge, and there has been come confusion for students and parents throughout the transition. Messaging was key to explain the process and importance of learning over grades. Superintendent Ebert noted that a long -term implementation plan which engage s parents and community members would be essential. President Ortiz asked about the Commission 's next steps. Dr. Moore responded that recommendations were in th e process of being finalized, and future steps would include further engagement with the Legislature. Dr. Moore highlighted the instructiona l programs t hat Nevada currently offers: competency -based education , personalized learning, project -based learning, independent study, and work -based learning , and noted that the Commission is considering creating a comprehensive pathway toward student learning for each student , based on each student 's needs. Another item under consideration would provide f lexibility to districts regarding calendar days versus minutes of instruction based on the pathway being used. 13: INFORMATION AND DISCUSSION REGARDING THE RESULTS OF THE ADDRESSING YOUTH NEEDS SURVEY AND THE NEVADA SCHOOL WELLBEING SURVEY Dr. Donald R. Ea ston-Brooks, Dean of the College of Education and Human Development, University of Nevada, Reno (U NR); Dr. Shannon Horrillo, Associate Director of Extension, UNR; and Dr. Ivory Lyles, Associate Dean for Enga gement and Director of Extension, UNR conducted a PowerPoint presentation regarding the Addressing Youth Needs Survey Results. Member Hughes asked if there were any trends across demographic grids; Dr. Hor rillo responded that further analysis w ould be completed . Some differences could be noted within ethnicity categories and responses regarding what is most important ; most respondents also had some post -secondary education and were female. Vice President Newburn asked h ow deli very models were affecting well -being satisfaction and noted that sample sizes were disproportionate to the size of their relative districts. Dr. Hor rillo noted that they could only work with the data they were able to collect ; they had hopes to expand further in future surveys. Vice President Newburn requested that a future survey pr ovide a delineation for respondents who have children attending differe nt schools to submit differ ing responses based on that difference. He also request ed that the data be compared against baseline s atisfaction from the previous school year, prior to COVID -19. Member Cantu noted that t he survey may be skewed, as 49% of respondents were highl y engaged with their schools, and engaged parents are more likely to have a higher level of education; the survey may make generalizations that have larger socioeconomic or racial impacts than re ckoned or acknowledged. He asked whether these results could be tied to a s tar ratin g system for the school, evaluating satisfaction and qual ity. Page 8 of 17 Dr. Ho rrillo noted that modality did not appear to be the leading factor in satisfactio n; instead, it depend ed on the family, their available resources, and the communications received . Dr. East on-Brooks stated that without a baseline, it is difficult to compare ; however, this data set could serve as a baseline from which to framework furth er research . He furt her noted th at in any data set over 1 ,000 more times than not it is 90% representative of the targeted population with a confidence interval of 90 -95%. Member Workman contextu alized that schoo ls had under three months to reinvent education ; with an improvement rating over half, this likely reflects satisfaction with the school and staff relationship , whi le the dissatisfaction rating indicates that a return to previous met hods may be best. He supported focusing on building relationships with students, families, and the community and working to return students to school buildings . Amber Reid, Education Programs Professional , Office for a Safe and Respectful Learning Environment , conducted a PowerPoint presentation regarding the Nevada School Wellbeing Survey. Member Wa lker noted that , unlike prior years, many students have been mot ivated and excited to be in classrooms ; however, underreporting regarding food and secu rity remains consistent. Member Hughes asked about follow -up; M s. Reid noted that each of the five feder al grants have internal reporting and evaluate the effectivity of their resources after delivery. Member Dockweiler noted that school staff have higher concerns for student and family mental health than matched by fam ily reporting and asked if there would be wraparound with staff to reduce the stre ss of educators; she further emphasized the need to address the disconnectedness felt by student s to their peers. Ms. Reid stated that a n administration climate survey would be conducted in follow -up and could b e compared against the 2019 climate survey. Member Walker expressed concern that the way t he questions are posed may be confusing for students , and efforts should be made to explain them and/or simplify them. Membe r Cantu e xpressed concern with aggregate data between two data sets - Ms. Reid clarif ied that survey results and analysis is available separated by group. Member Dockw eiler asked for follow -up presentation s once ana lysis had been completed for both the Nevada School Wellbeing Sur vey and the Addressing Youth Ne eds Survey. President Ortiz asked if any of the federal grants focused on suppor ts for educators; Ms. Reid noted that the Student Mental Services Grant is spec ifically for educators , while the remaining grants have provi sions or room to support educators in addition to students. Responding to President Ortiz regarding a solution to student connectedness, Member Gallegos noted that communication is two-sided, and the burden of correcting connectedness cannot f all entirely on students ; learning communication and gaining communication tools is also critical. [Convenience Break ] 14: INFORMATION, DISCUSSION , AND POSSIBLE ACTION REGARDING THE NEVADA EDUCATOR PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE TEACHERS AND LEADERS COUNCIL Kathleen Galland -Collins, Education Programs Supervisor, Office of Educator Development Licensure, and Family Engagement conducted a PowerPoint presentation regarding the Nevada Educator Performance Framework (NEPF ). Responding to Member Hughes, Ms. Galland -Collins noted that some the indicators and standar ds used when the rubric was previously designed could not receive a score of four and li mited the receivable high sc ore. Redesigning the rubrics and indicators makes every indicator able to receive a four and engage with the score range. Responding to Member Cantu, Ms. Galland -Collins noted that the student performan ce correlation for the Alternative Performance Framework (APF) is based on the student learning goal ( SLG). While you could have a highly effective teacher in a low performing school when only looing at assessment data, the data to observe is growth and impact ; are students showing growth as r eflected in the SLGs ? Vice President Newburn expressed that the Board has consi stently st ruggled wit h this item, as the ratings have an impact that could lead to an Page 9 of 17 educator losing their job , despite the rating of \"developi ng\" as a human performance measure equating to \"exceeds expectations \". Vice President Newburn stated that the identification of educators should be removed , as the system places all teachers as effective or ineffective and no administrators as ineffective , as the system can equate to job loss if rated less than \"highly effective \". Member Walker supported NEPF 's focus on continual improvement, noted that some elements of the evaluation matrix , such as student growth objectives, do not meaningfully contr ibute ; teachers find them easier to attain and fear failing to meet the threshold, ultimately meeting the status quo but failing to take risks to push student growth . Memb er Hughes stated that changing the score ranges would only adapt how reviewers conduct their ratings, and the distribution curve will effectively remain the same. Member Workman emphasized that it sounded as th ough they w ere stating that administrators are in tentionally gaming the system , when Nevada is a state full of teachers and administrators working extremely hard and doing their best to work within a flawed system ; Member Hudson suppo rted this statement. Vice President Newburn stated that in 2011, when the NEPF was introduced by legislation, there was a sentiment that the problem in education was that ineffective teachers were not being removed ; this was meant to drive out anyone who was not highly effective. Efforts over the last decade have been to walk that back. Member Cantu stated that his intention was not to insult administrator s or tea chers, only that the evaluation system is flawed . Growth o ver time, including a teacher 's grow th over time, is what the model should strive for, yet that does not appear to reflect the current model. President Ortiz asked if the APF could be waived for this year ; Superintendent Ebert not ed that there is legislation moving forward requesting that specifically which may or may not move forward. Member Walker stated that as they are already halfway through the year, educators and a dministrators have already dedicated a significant amount of time to it. He emphasized that one of the greater hardships is the teacher shortage; while the NEPF could be used to drive out educators, it does not replace them. The NEPF is flawed because it is used to punish educators , rather than a s a skills assessment used to direct additional supports and provide retention services. Superintendent Ebert agreed that educators want to see improvement and have con versations about progress , but there has been a lack of support. She emphasized the importance of a strategic plan for implementation and continued conversations to establish what is working and what is not to move forward. Member Dockweiler moved to maintain the historical score rangers for Teachers and Building Administrators be used for all NEPF Educator groups for the 2020 -21 school year. Member Walker seconded. Motion passed. 15: INFORMATION, DISCUSSION, AND POSSIBLE ACTION REGARDING CRITERIA FOR THE EVALUATION OF THE DEVELOP MENT OF LANGUAGE AND LITERACY SKILLS BY CHILDREN LESS THAN SIX YEARS OF AGE AND ARE D/DEAF, HARD OF HEARING, BLIND, OR VISUALLY IMPA IRED Will Jensen, Director of the Office of Inclusive Education, and Candace Emerson, Cha ir, Senate Bill 203 Advisory Committee, conducted a PowerP oint presentation regarding Recommendations for Criteria for the Evaluation of the Dev elopment of Language and Literacy Skills by Children Less Than Six Years of Age and are d/Deaf, Hard of Hearing, Blink, or Visually Impaired. Member Hughes requested clarification regarding the language in the re commendations that s tate \"includ ing, without limitation , children ...using primarily spoken or written English \". Chair Emerson stated that the Committee worked to include l anguage such as \"not limited to \", as there are many different languages, more than American Sign Language, for the hearing impaire d. Member Dockweiler moved to approve the R ecommendations of the Senate Bill 203 Advisory Committee . Member Cantu seconded. Motion passed . Page 10 of 17 16: INFORMATION AND DISCUSSION REGARDING NEVADA CLASS SIZES AND THE EDUCATOR WORKFORCE Felicia Gonz ales, Deputy Superintendent for Educator Effectiveness and Family Engage ment ; Justin White, Data Insight Partners; and Nathan Trenholm, Data Insight Partners, conducted a PowerPoint presentation regarding Nevada Class Sizes and the Educator Workfo rce. Vice President Newburn asked what c ould be done to address the issues highligh ted in the presentation. Superintendent Ebert noted that for the Board, am plifying this information within the community would be a great help. The Department will also be coo rdinatin g with Chancellor Me lody Rose of the Nevada System of High er Education to address the t eacher pipeline. The presentation would also be taken to the Commission on School Funding , where they would discuss the funding needed in connecti on to their larger charge to find t he revenues and mechanisms for optimal funding. Member Gallegos noted that while funding and policy are incredibly im portant, he also felt that changing the culture would also be key. Mem ber Hughes felt that the data presented did not get to the root cause of the shortages ; he stated that Nevada has increased its enrollment and completers in its teacher pipeline, but those numbers are not commensurate with t he growth in enrollment and cl ass size reductions. He also expressed that seeing this data by classroom achievement levels rather than star ratings may help in understanding the issues . Member Walker emphasized the impo rtance of adequately funding districts, and supported Member Gallego 's statement regarding shifts in culture ; respecting , valuing, and advocating for teachers, educators , schools, and districts. Member Dockweil er noted that nothing works in isolation, and Nevada must be considered as part of the larger United States as well . Vice President Newburn supported not only increases for licensure, but increased funding for teacher scholarship programs. President Ortiz emphasized the important of spr eading community awareness. 17: 11:00 A.M. PUBLIC HEARING FOR REGULATION # R118 -20 President Ortiz called the hearing for R118 -20 to order at 3:41 P.M. Kathleen Galland -Collins, Education Programs Supervisor, Office of Educator Development Licensure, and Family Engagement provided an overview of the proposed regulation R118 -20, the Nevada Educator Performance Network. No public comment was submitted regarding this regulation. Vice President Newburn moved to approve R118 -20; Member Coombs seconded. Motion passed. President Ortiz adjourned the h earing for R118 -20 at 3:52 P.M. 18: FUTURE AGENDA ITEMS Vice President Newburn requested a n update regarding implementation of Assembly Bill 469. Member Dockweiler request ed a follow -up to the Nevada School Wellb eing and Addressing Youth Needs Surveys .

Page 12 of 17 Item A1 , Nevada Coalition to Address Personnel Shortages in Special Education and Related Services Re: Agenda Item #14: Nevada Educator Performance Framework and recommendations from the Teachers and Leaders Council Dear Vice President Newburn and Members of the State Board of Education, My name is Nancy Kuhles. I am a Speech -Language Pathologist, Co -Chair of the NSHA Coalition to Address Personnel Shortages and serve in the role of Lead for the Spee ch-Language Pathologist OLEP Workgroup that revised the NEPF Framework for Speech Language Pathologists (SLPs). For the record, I would like to address Item #14 on the State Board of Education's agenda and the information that will be presented. On behal f of the Speech -Language Pathologist OLEP Workgroup, I respectfully request the members of the State Board of Education to approve the recommendations from the Teachers and Leaders Council to change the score ranges for Speech -Language Pathologists based o n the change to the Speech -Language Pathologist's rubric. The change to the score ranges aligns with the NEPF score ranges for all Other Licensed Educational Personnel (OLEP) and all NEPF Educator groups. The NEPF Framework for SLPs was revised in 2019 -2020 and fully implemented in 2020 -2021. The revised SLP rubric, developed by SLPs for SLPs, is clear, concise, and captures the essence and real work of a Speech - Language Pathologist. The revised SLP rubric aligns with ASHA's national standards and practic es, nationally recognized practice guidance standards (IPEC), federal regulations (ESSA/Nevada Plan) and where applicable, the Nevada Educator Performance Framework (NEPF) and the High Leverage Practices for Special Educators developed by the Collaboration for Effective Educator Development, Accountability and Reform (CEEDAR), and the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC). The High Leverage Practices are organized around four aspects of practice: Collaboration, Assessment, Social/Emotional/Behavioral and I nstruction. The revised SLP NEPF rubric has four standards and 17 Indicators, of which all 17 Indicators are High Leverage Practices. The proposed change to the score ranges for SLPs based on the change to the SLP rubric are: 3.6 to 4.0, Highly Effective ; 2.8 to 3.59 Effective; 1.91 to 2.79 Developing; and 1.0 to 1.9 Ineffective. These score ranges align with the NEPF score ranges for OLEPs, which includes Educational Audiologists, School Counselors, School Nurses, School Psychologists, School Social Work ers, and Teacher - Librarians. The proposed change to the score ranges for SLPs aligns with the NEPF score ranges for all Educator groups. The SLP OLEP Workgroup supports the proposed change to the score ranges for Speech -Language Pathologists to align with NEPF score ranges for all OLEPs and Educator groups. On behalf of the Speech -Language Pathologist OLEP Workgroup, I would like to take this opportuni ty to thank Vice President Newburn and the Members of the State Board of Education for all the work you do. Thank you for opportunity to submit public comment on agenda item #14 regarding the Nevada Educator Performance Framework and recommendations from t he Teachers and Leaders Council. I respectfully request your consideration in approving the change to the score ranges for Speech - Language Pathologists for the 2020 -2021 school year in order to align with the NEPF score ranges for all Other Licensed Educational Personnel and Educator groups. Thank you for your time and consideration. Respectfully submitted, Nancy Kuhles, M.S. CCC -SLP ASHA Fellow NSHA Coalition Co -Chair OLEP Workgroup Lead Page 13 of 17 Item A2, Nevada S peech -Language Hearing Association Re: Agenda Item #14: Nevada Educator Performance Framework and recommendations from the Teachers and Leaders Council. Dear Vice President Newburn and Members of the State Board of Education, The Nevada Speech -Language H earing Association (NSHA), the professional organization of Speech - Language Pathologists (SLPs) and Audiologists in the State of Nevada, is in strong support of the score range changes proposed in Agenda Item #14. The performance evaluation holds school -based SLPs to the highest professional standards and aligns with the expected competencies and standards outlined by the American Speech -Language Hearing Association (ASHA). Not only does this evaluation ensure that SLPs are successfully demonstrating the expected level of professionalism, but feedback can also be applied in future professional growth opportunities. Aligning the scoring ranges to Nevada's Other Licensed Educational Personnel (OLEP) groups makes it easier for evaluators to be consistent in t heir ratings and understanding of educator expectations. NSHA works in conjunction with the University of Nevada, Reno, Nevada State College, and the State of Nevada Speech -Language Pathology, Audiology, and Hearing Aid Dispensing Board to ensure that the professionals in our beloved field adhere to professional standards of excellence. We believe that this performance evaluation will demonstrate the value and contributions of the SLPs who are school -based in the State of Nevada. NSHA and the NSHA Board o f Directors would like to thank Vice President Newburn and State Board of Education for all that you do. NSHA is proud to support this effort for SLPs to have a scoring rubric that matches that of other educators in Nevada. Respectfully submitted, Kim R eddig, MS, CCC -SLP Speech -Language Pathologist President, Nevada Speech -Language Hearing Association (NSHA) info@nsha.org Page 14 of 17 Item A3 , Nevada State Education Association Nevada must find the strength to be brave and be bold . The proposed K -12 budget introduced last week outlining $156 Million in cuts to the Class Size Reduction program means at least a thousand fewer teaching positions will be funded in the next biennium. Additionally, the reduction in per pupil funding of $132 per year will force the elimination of an additional thousand jobs from our schools. This is no way to build a stronger Nevada or make progress on diversifying our economy. As a teacher of 25 years, I worry how our next generation of Nevada students will be able to compete. As a father of 4 children who have spent their entire school lives in Nevada public schools, I am grateful that 3 of my kids will have graduated before these proposed cuts take effect. For my youngest child, what do you propose I tell her? If nothing changes from this proposed budget, this is how the conversation will begin: \"I know your high school does not currently offer any music programs, \"I know your high school does not have a counselor and currently no timely access to counseling services, \"I know your high school has long term substitutes in key teaching positions. But the Governor proposes cutting thousands of education jobs so your high school will have even less for the next 2 years.\" \"So what else do you think your school should get rid of, s ports, advanced Math, Physics, Spanish?\" This is not an acceptable conversation for a parent to be forced to have. This is not an acceptable budget proposal for the current students in Nevada. It is time to stand up for our students. NSEA is calling on t his Board to please lead and fight to invest in our kids. It is time to be brave . It is time to be bold. Thank you. Brian Rippet NSEA President Page 15 of 17 Item A4 , Caryne Shea Good morning, Board members, My name is Caryne Shea and I have been a public school parent and active education advocate for the past ten years. I regularly stream the Board of Education meetings and would like to thank you all for the incredible work being done on behalf of Nevada's students. In your deliberation regarding the role of President today, I'd like to express my support for Felicia Ortiz. I feel she will continue the strong leadership of former President Wynn, that she is someone who is willing to compromise but cannot be compromised, and who never loses sight of the needs of our children. As a veteran board member, and someone who has been both appointed and elected, Felicia Ortiz brings a wealth of knowledge to the role and our children would benefit immensely from her le adership. Thank you, Caryne Shea Page 16 of 17 Item A5, Ed Gonzales Re: Public Comment - Non-Agenda Item My name is Ed Gonzalez and I am the community member on the Hickey Elementary School Organizational Team which is located in Sunrise Manor township of Clark County. I was unable to submit testimony when the last State Board of Education on the agenda item \"Emerging Issues regar ding the Reorganization of the Clark County School District\" and would like my comments to be included in the conversation. At that meeting, there was some discussion on what is being considered a large amount of attrition and carryover dollars in schools and believe some testimony given does not paint an accurate position on what is happening at school sites. A comment was submitted saying that attrition/carryover dollars were $142 million and how this is not what the law was intended to do. I strongly di sagree. The large amount of attrition dollars is the result of the failure of CCSD to be able to recruit and retain teachers during the school year. It is well known that these vacancies are mostly at our Title 1 schools. That is why nearly 80% of attriti on/carryover dollars are at these Title 1 schools. The only thing that is surprising is the large amount that schools have been given in attrition dollars. Everyone believes that schools who purchase a teacher at a cost of $88,000+ and only get a long -term sub with a cost around $30 -35,000 should receive the difference because they did not receive the \"service\" they bought. At Hickey ES, it is normal to our school to have numerous teacher vacancies due to many factors compared to other schools in the di strict including being a Title 1 school and isolated in a hard to reach part of Sunrise Manor. However, due to the hard work of our administration and staff, this may be the first school year that we are fully staffed with licensed educators. The idea th at our school or others are intentionally \"holding\" these positions vacant and \"banking\" dollars is utterly ridiculous. In fact, we used our attrition/carryover dollars this fall to save multiple teaching positions because we had devastating cuts from th e special session along with a usually large number of educators willing to teach at Hickey ES this year. Furthermore, we have seen a failure by CCSD to implement the Reorganization more than four years after the initial regulations were approved. One ex ample are schools and principals do not be fiscal autonomy under NRS 388G.610 and NAC 388.G.110 and NAC 388.G.140. Once a responsibility and dollars are passed down to schools, they have the ability to spend those dollars on what they think is best for the ir students. We have heard stories and read news article about how school were once allowed to purchase or wanted to purchase services/products from outside vendors to help with student achievement only to be denied later without reason. Since the law are never been fully implemented, I would request that the State Board of Education not draft any new regulations until the law is fully implement and the State Superintendent use her authority under NRS to ensure that compliance with the CCS D Reorganization is done with all deliberate speed. Four years in enough time for CCSD to comply with the law. Thank you, Ed Gonzalez Community Member Hickey Elementary School Organizational Team Page 17 of 17 Item A6 , Raquel O'Neill My name is Raquel O'Neill, LCS W, President of Blindconnect. As a completely blind individual and mother I would like to give voice to the concerns and needs of action item #15, language and literacy. As an advocate, it has been my experience that blind and visually impaired children es pecially when diagnosed with a progressive condition, face many challenges with accessing language and literacy for several reasons. I would like to extend my collaboration and professional assistance to the committee in moving forward to ensure equal repr esentation of blind and visually impaired children's needs within the continued good work of SB203. Deaf, blind, and deafblind children ALL need high expectations, and they need tools like the criteria envisioned by this bill. "}
