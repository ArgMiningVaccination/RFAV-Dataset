In 1974 he moved to New York City where he studied with Dr. Eng, a doctor of [Chinese Herbal Medicine](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Chinese_Herbal_Medicine.html). In 1976 he began study with western herbalist William LeSassier who developed the theory of Triune formulas and he also took university courses in anatomy & physiology, pharmacognosy, cellular biology, etc. In 1977 he started his clinical practice and in 1982 he founded one of NJ's first holistic health centers, The Awareness Health Center, in Franklin Park, NJ.

[[5]](#_note-4/) Herbal Manufacturing Winston founded Herbalist and Alchemist, an herbal tincture firm known for [spagyric](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Spagyric.html) alchemical processing of herbs. Unlike most commercially available herbal tinctures, the alchemically processed herbs have mineral constituents reduced to ash from the marc added back after filtration. Herbalist and Alchemist does not standardize their herbal products as Winston point out that standardization has not been standardized yet. Different companies use different markers, or different levels of the same markers, or different methods of testing for marker compounds. He also points out that whenever different compounds are chosen as \"active ingredients\" for different herbs, there is a chance that suppliers will get a substandard batch (low on the chemical markers) and mix it with a batch higher in the desired marker to compensate for the difference.

The 'David Winston Center for Herbal Studies, which trains experienced herbalists and medical personnel in the use of herbal medicines, using over 300 plants taken from [Chinese Medicine](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Chinese_Medicine.html), [Ayurveda](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Ayurveda.html), Native American, Eclectic and European herbal traditions, with subtle differentiation between species and uses. His philosophy is to use plants from various traditions, analyzed in a way that allows him to construct formulas based on Cherokee, Triune, Chinese or other traditions that match the individual, rather than using herbs stereotyped for a specific disease. This is a kind of constitutional medicine that puts the strengths and weaknesses of a patient at the center of the analysis rather than the named disease, and is common to most traditional herbal medicine traditions. He has trained hundreds of herbalists over the last 25 years and taught classes for thousands of healthcare practitioners. [[9]](#_note-8/) A number of the leading younger herbalists in the United States today were trained in his methodology and he has taught in Canada and Europe as well.
