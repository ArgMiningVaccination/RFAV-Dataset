Gardasil Vaccine Lawsuit [Gardasil Lawsuit Update](#gardasil-vaccine-update) - September 2023 The Gardasil vaccine, manufactured by Merck & Co., was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2006 for use in preventing infection from only a few of the hundreds of types of human papillomavirus (HPV). Since hitting the market, however, thousands of adolescents and adults have reported [serious and disabling Gardasil side effects](/prescription-drugs/gardasil-lawsuit/gardasil-side-effects/) after receiving the HPV vaccine.

Underlying the entire Gardasil controversy are clinical trials (human testing) that victims allege were fraudulently conducted and reported. Preliminary evidence compiled by a team of Gardasil attorneys and investigators suggests that the [clinical trials Merck conducted for the Gardasil HPV vaccine were flagrantly deceptive and unscientific](/prescription-drugs/gardasil-lawsuit/hpv-vaccine/). [According to Mary Holland and Kim Mack Rosenberg, and Eileen Iorio](https://books.google.com/books?id=_nSCDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT225&lpg=PT225&dq=The+HPV+Vaccine+On+Trial:+Weighing+the+Evidence+mary+holland&source=bl&ots=ry3P46YfpQ&sig=ACfU3U33eTOnJsxJoASD5D8tmkD_98Tx8w&hl=en&ppis=_c&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjZ143PoNzoAhW9JzQIHcE_B), co-authors of the book, The HPV Vaccine On Trial: Seeking Justice For a Generation Betrayed, \"none of the participants in the [Gardasil] clinical trials received a true saline placebo,\" which means the clinical trials failed to measure the effects of Gardasil against a true control. Instead of receiving a placebo, some clinical trial subjects received aluminum-containing adjuvants, chemical mixtures, and other vaccines, which masked adverse events and made Gardasil seem safer than it would have otherwise. According to Holland, Mack Rosenberg, and Iorio, \"HPV vaccines have never been proven to prevent against cervical or other cancer.\" Gardasil Injury Attorney Team with Proven Track Record Against Major Pharmaceutical Companies Wisner Baum represents individuals who were harmed by HPV vaccine side effects.

The first phase will address the issue of general causation (whether the HPV vaccine is capable of causing the alleged side effects). The second phase will address all remaining liability and damage issues. Thirteen of the 16 plaintiffs selected as bellwether candidates have filed amended complaints, per the latest case management conference on August 29. Additionally, one of the cases Merck chose as a bellwether candidate was dismissed with prejudice. The company will soon select a replacement. With nearly 100 cases in the MDL, there are currently hundreds of additional claims making their way through Vaccine Court. We believe many of these cases will enter the MDL in the coming months. August 23, 2023: As of today, there are [92 Gardasil lawsuits pending in the MDL](https://www.jpml.uscourts.gov/sites/jpml/files/Pending_MDL_Dockets_By_Docket_Type-August-15-2023.pdf). In September, our firm and colleagues with cases in the MDL will start conducting depositions. A deposition is an important part of the discovery process where attorneys question experts, company representatives, and other parties under oath. In these depositions, we plan to gather testimony and facts about what Merck knew about Gardasil and its potential to cause injuries, and more. Other upcoming events in the Gardasil MDL: Plaintiff Expert reports are due in March of 2024, and we anticipate an order on summary judgment in the fall of 2024. This order will determine the next phase of the litigation. If Judge Conrad denies Merck's motion for summary judgment, the litigation will move toward trial. July 26, 2023: Gardasil lawyers at Wisner Baum and colleagues in the federal MDL recently submitted a joint report to the judge overseeing the litigation. The report detailed progress as attorneys prepare the initial group of bellwether cases. Bellwether trials are essentially test cases that indicate potential results for the pool of similar lawsuits. A total of 16 claims were selected as bellwether cases; the plaintiffs selected five cases, Merck selected five cases, four were selected at random, and U.S. District Judge Robert J. Conrad selected the remaining two. The first Gardasil trial in the federal MDL will likely occur in late 2024 or early 2025. Although the outcomes of the bellwether trials will not be binding on other claims, they will be closely monitored to assess how juries respond to the evidence and expert testimony. The average payouts in these cases may influence settlement offers from Merck to avoid individual cases going before juries. As of this writing, there are at least 89 cases in the Gardasil MDL, though we expect this number to increase significantly in the coming months as hundreds of claims are pending in Vaccine Court. Those who allege HPV vaccine side effects must first bring their claims to Vaccine Court before they can file a lawsuit against Merck in civil court. June 14, 2023: The judge overseeing Gardasil lawsuits consolidated in the federal MDL has ruled that bellwether trials will involve plaintiffs who allege the HPV vaccine caused POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome) or primary ovarian failure (POF) / primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). May 22, 2023: Gardasil lawsuits are progressing in the federal MDL. As of this date, there are [86 cases](https://www.jpml.uscourts.gov/sites/jpml/files/Pending_MDL_Dockets_By_Actions_Pending-May-15-2023.pdf) in the Gardasil MDL, many of which were filed on behalf of our clients. We have 88 other Gardasil cases that have gone through Vaccine Court and are being worked up for filing in civil court. Over 100 cases are pending in Vaccine Court with 32 others that are being prepared to file. While the Gardasil MDL is where federal cases are consolidated, there are Gardasil cases filed in California state court as well. As of this date, seven are pending in California. April 6, 2023: We are pleased to report that the judge overseeing the federal Gardasil MDL in North Carolina recently ordered Merck to produce its entire database of Gardasil adverse events to attorneys representing women and men suing the company over Gardasil-induced autoimmune conditions. With the order, plaintiffs' attorneys and their experts will have access to Merck's adverse event database under a protective order. Gardasil Lawsuit Seeks Punitive Damages Against Merck for Fraud, Deceit and Negligence Wisner Baum is one of the leading law firms filing Merck Gardasil lawsuits. In 2019, we joined forces with other attorneys to bring our expertise in litigating against big pharma in a Gardasil civil lawsuit pending in the Superior Court of California, Los Angeles on behalf of a woman who suffered severe adverse immunological and other adverse reactions, including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) after receiving three injections of the Gardasil vaccine. Symptoms of POTS relate to reduced blood volume when a person stands up after lying down, resulting in lightheadedness, fainting and rapid heartbeat. The condition can be incapacitating. The Gardasil lawsuit allegations against Merck include fraud, deceit and negligence for: - Failing to disclose important information regarding Gardasil's safety and effectiveness. - Failing to perform essential \"scientific and medical investigations and studies relating to the safety, effectiveness and need for the Gardasil vaccine\" as required by FDA regulations. - Manipulating consumers by preying on their fear of cancer and by \"repeatedly stating, representing, urging and implying\" that it was necessary for girls and young women to take the Gardasil vaccine to prevent cervical cancer. The suit further alleges that Merck failed to properly warn consumers of the risk of serious adverse reactions tied to the administration of the Gardasil HPV vaccine and failed to inform them of material facts related to the vaccine, including: - The Gardasil shot was only known to be effective for five years. - Other methods were known to be effective in avoiding the HPV virus. - The risk that an HPV infection would lead to precancerous lesions was minimal. - Existing methods for diagnosing and treating HPV precancerous lesions or cancer were effective. The Gardasil vaccine lawsuit also seeks punitive damages due to Merck's alleged deceit and fraud.

We will work tirelessly to ensure those rights are defended and victims of injustice are compensated for their injuries. Is Gardasil Dangerous? [Gardasil ingredients include](/prescription-drugs/gardasil-lawsuit/gardasil-ingredients/) virus like particles (VLPs) which are genetically engineered from a protein of HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18 (and Gardasil 9 includes additional types: 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58); amorphous aluminum polysorbate 80; sodium borate; and water for injection. As you can see, each Gardasil shot contains ingredients in addition to the genetically modified virus like particles. These ingredients are capable of causing adverse reactions in their own right. In a [2020 peer-reviewed study](https://systematicreviewsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13643-019-0983-y/), Dr. J\u00f8rgensen and other researchers analyzed the available clinical trial data for all HPV vaccines, including Gardasil. The researchers found that the HPV vaccines were associated with a nearly two-fold increased risk of POTS. The study authors further reported that \"HPV vaccines increased serious nervous disorders.\" The Gardasil attorneys at Wisner Baum have filed numerous lawsuits on behalf of young adults who suffered Gardasil shot reactions. Many of our clients allege they developed POTS from Gardasil. Others say the HPV vaccine caused other autoimmune diseases and debilitating injuries. Gardasil Vaccine Deaths and Injuries [The Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS)](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccine-adverse-events/vaers-overview) was established in 1990 as a means of detecting problems in vaccines. The system is managed by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As of Jan. 14, 2020, the VAERS database contains over 64,000 case reports of adverse reactions tied to HPV vaccines worldwide (over 50,000 in the U.S.). More than 9,600 cases reported serious adverse events, including 547 deaths. Serious adverse events are defined as adverse reactions that result in death, are life-threatening, require hospitalization or lengthen a hospital stay, or result in persistent or significant disability. However, it is estimated that only 1% of serious adverse events are actually reported to VAERS. The vast majority of HPV vaccine cases, serious cases, and [deaths](/prescription-drugs/gardasil-lawsuit/gardasil-deaths/) reported in VAERS are tied to Merck's HPV Gardasil vaccine. For example, of the death cases found in VAERS, Merck is named in "}
