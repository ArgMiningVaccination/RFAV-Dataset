This case-control study documents the experience of 61 young people with past or current functional neurological disorder (FND) in relation to the COVID-19 vaccination program in Australia. Methods: Information about the young person's/parent's choice and response pertaining to COVID-19 vaccination was collected as part of routine clinical care or FND research program follow-up. Results: 61 young people treated for FND (47 females, mean age = 16.22 years) and 46 healthy controls (34 females, mean age = 16.37 years) were included in the study. Vaccination rates were high: 58/61 (95.1%) in the FND group and 45/46 (97.8%) in the control group. In the FND group, 2 young people (2/61, 3.3%) presented with new-onset FND following COVID-19 vaccination; two young people with resolved FND reported an FND relapse (2/36, 5.56%); and two young people with unresolved FND (2/20, 10.0%) reported an FND exacerbation. In the control group no FND symptoms were reported. Conclusions: Acute-onset FND symptoms following COVID-19 vaccination are uncommon in the general population. In young people prone to FND, COVID-19 vaccination can sometimes trigger new-onset FND, FND relapse, or FND exacerbation.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-11-28", "cleaned_text": "COVID-19 Vaccination in Young People with Functional Neurological Disorder: A Case-Control Study Young people with FND present with motor, sensory, cognitive, and seizure symptoms unexplained by other neurological disorders. While the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fifth edition; DSM-5) no longer requires identification of a precipitating stressor, young people with FND\u2014and their families\u2014commonly report a triggering stressor or event against the background of cumulative stress or adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) [ [3](#B3-vaccines-10-02031), [4](#B4-vaccines-10-02031)]. The types of reported stressors are very broad. Common psychological stressors include worry, loss, and distress pertaining to family, friendship, school, and maltreatment. Common physical stressors include illness (e.g., viral illness), injury (e.g., a fall, sprains, fractures, or a hit on the head), and medical procedures (e.g., surgery, imaging procedures, and vaccinations). Contemporary aetiological models adopt a biopsychosocial network (systems) perspective [ [1](#B1-vaccines-10-02031), [5](#B5-vaccines-10-02031), [6](#B6-vaccines-10-02031), [7](#B7-vaccines-10-02031)]. These models propose that FND involves complex interactions between biological susceptibility and lived experience, including the effect of that experience on activation of the stress system(s), on the brain as active predictor [ [8](#B8-vaccines-10-02031), [9](#B9-vaccines-10-02031), [10](#B10-vaccines-10-02031)], on the perception of that experience, and on the biological (epigenetic) embedding of lived experience in the body and brain [ [2](#B2-vaccines-10-02031), [3](#B3-vaccines-10-02031), [8](#B8-vaccines-10-02031), [11](#B11-vaccines-10-02031)]. In the current study we document, for a cohort of young people with past or current treatment for FND, reports of new-onset, exacerbated, or recurrent functional neurological symptoms following vaccination for COVID-19. In the discussion we apply our current understanding of FND to consider the potential mechanisms by which vaccination may trigger FND symptoms. [12](#B12-vaccines-10-02031)]. In Australia, the vaccine became available to young people under 16 years of age in early 2021 (see [Supplementary Text Box S1](#app1-vaccines-10-02031)for information about COVID-19 rollout in Australia) [ [13](#B13-vaccines-10-02031), [14](#B14-vaccines-10-02031), [15](#B15-vaccines-10-02031)]. Data pertaining to young people's adverse responses to the COVID-19 vaccine is just beginning to emerge. [16](#B16-vaccines-10-02031), [17](#B17-vaccines-10-02031)]. In our own clinical setting, many parents of young people with FND have expressed anxiety about potential neurological complications of the COVID-19 vaccine\u2014and other vaccina-tions\u2014with particular worries pertaining to relapse or worsening of the young person's FND symptoms. Many parents have requested our clinical opinion with regard to the po-tential risks of vaccination. In our responses to these parents, we have acknowledged both the difficulty of the decision-making process and the need to consider the risks to their child (see section below). We have communicated that from our medical standpoint the risks of not being vaccinated outweigh the risks of vaccination. An unvaccinated young person has an increased risk of experiencing a more severe illness and of developing long COVID, with gaps in knowledge about long-term outcome [ [18](#B18-vaccines-10-02031), [19](#B19-vaccines-10-02031), [20](#B20-vaccines-10-02031), [21](#B21-vaccines-10-02031), [22](#B22-vaccines-10-02031), [23](#B23-vaccines-10-02031), [24](#B24-vaccines-10-02031)]. We have also pointed the family to available information resources [ [25](#B25-vaccines-10-02031)]. During this conversation with the par-ents, we mention that all vaccinations, and not just the ones for COVID-19, are associated with a small risk of complications (see below) and that, while the risk of complications from COVID-19 vaccination is small, it is not yet possible to identify the individuals who might be affected. [26](#B26-vaccines-10-02031), [27](#B27-vaccines-10-02031), [28](#B28-vaccines-10-02031)]. Some complications are understood to reflect a response to the vaccine constituents [ [27](#B27-vaccines-10-02031)], whereas others reflect a range of stress-related responses\u2014termed immunization stress-related responses (ISRRs) [ [29](#B29-vaccines-10-02031)]. A historical and cross-cultural analysis suggests that ISRRs \"have been observed in different cultures, particularly in children and adolescents\" [ [30](#B30-vaccines-10-02031)] (p. 330). Stress-related re-sponses can be divided into three clusters: - Acute anxiety-related responses that manifest just prior to, during, or after the administration of the vaccine (e.g., fainting [vasovagal response], palpitations, hyperventilation, and fear cognitions) [ [29](#B29-vaccines-10-02031)]. - Acute-onset functional neurological symptoms (\u00b1nonspecific functional symptoms) that manifest hours or days after the vaccination (e.g., weakness or paralysis, shaking, twitching and abnormal movements, limb posturing, gait irregularities, speech difficulties, and functional seizures) [ [29](#B29-vaccines-10-02031), [31](#B31-vaccines-10-02031), [32](#B32-vaccines-10-02031), [33](#B33-vaccines-10-02031)]. Using European terminology, the World Health Organization calls acute-onset functional neurological symptoms dissociative neurological symptom reactions (DNSRs) [ [29](#B29-vaccines-10-02031)]. We retain the terms functional neurological symptoms and functional neurological disorder, which are used by the large majority of researchers in the field. [7](#B7-vaccines-10-02031)]). Stress-related hyperventilation involves activation of the autonomic nervous system coupled with acti-vation of the respiratory motor system (for review, see Chapter 7 in Kozlowska et al. (2020)). Hyperventilation and low pCO2 are associated with a cascade of neurophysio-logical changes that underpin a broad array of functional somatic symptoms (see [Supplementary Text Box S2](#app1-vaccines-10-02031)) [ [34](#B34-vaccines-10-02031), [35](#B35-vaccines-10-02031)]. Fear cognitions are known to arise in neurophysiological states of high arousal triggered by fear stimuli, such as a medical procedure (including vaccination) [ [36](#B36-vaccines-10-02031)]. 2. Methods 2.1. Participants [Supplementary Text Box S3](#app1-vaccines-10-02031)for positive rule-in signs for FND) [ [37](#B37-vaccines-10-02031), [38](#B38-vaccines-10-02031)]. Four participants who had participated in other components of the research program could not be contacted, and one parent decided not to participate in the current component. Forty-six healthy controls had been recruited from the same age bracket and geographical catchment area. Control participants were screened for the absence of mental health disorders, history of head in-jury, family history of mental health disorders, and chronic health concerns. Control par-ticipants constituted a control group for previous study components looking at biological markers [ [2](#B2-vaccines-10-02031), [3](#B3-vaccines-10-02031)], and they likewise constituted a healthy control group for the current study. [Table 1](#vaccines-10-02031-t001)) and the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) (see [Supplementary Text Box S4](#app1-vaccines-10-02031)for description of measures) [ [39](#B39-vaccines-10-02031), [40](#B40-vaccines-10-02031), [41](#B41-vaccines-10-02031)]. One young person with FND had been too ill to complete the measures on initial presentation. All young people were rated on the Global Assessment of Functioning scale (GAF). 2.2. Data Acquisition [Supplementary Text Box S5](#app1-vaccines-10-02031)for script used to guide the phone interviews). For young people presenting for treatment during this study, the same questions were asked face-to-face. If the young per-son had been vaccinated, the young person and parent were asked about the number of doses the young person had received. They were also asked, using an open-ended ques-tion, whether the young person had experienced any issues with the COVID-19 vaccina-tion. The interviewers (NL and KK) did not offer any suggestions as to what \"possible is-sues\" could entail. For the small subset of young people who presented with FND follow-ing COVID-19 presentation, the information pertaining to the young person's response to vaccination was part of the clinical history on presentation. 2.3. Analysis of Clinical Characteristics and Self-Report Data 3. Results 3.1. Participant Characteristics [Figure 1](#vaccines-10-02031-f001)). They presented with one or more functional neurological symptoms (range, 1-9; mean = 3.32, SD = 1.96; median = 3.00) and significant functional disability (GAF scores ranging from 10 to 51 (mean = 31.77, SD 9.26; median = 31.00) (see [Supplementary Text Box S4](#app1-vaccines-10-02031)). On presentation for treatment, 53 (86.9%) had suffered from a comorbid mental health disorder. Anxiety (n = 51, 83.6%) and depression (n = 31, 50.8%) were the most common). In addition, 21 (34.4%) had reported suicidal ideation, and 16 (26.2%) had suffered from one or more comorbid functional syndromes: functional gut disorder (n = 10, 16.4%), postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) (n = 6, 9.8%), and frequent vasovagal events (n = 1, 1.6%). 3.2. Self-Report Measures and Heart Rate on Admission to the Research Program [Table 1](#vaccines-10-02031-t001)). On admission to the research program, young people in the FND group also reported higher levels of distress (total DASS score: range, 3-52; mean = 27.68, SD = 12.86; median = 28) compared to healthy controls (range, 0-30; mean = 5.72, SD = 5.67; median = 4.00) (t(85.50) = 11.82; p < 0.001)). 3.3. Health Status at Time of Vaccination (or Option of Vaccination) [Table 2](#vaccines-10-02031-t002)). [Table 2](#vaccines-10-02031-t002)). Eight (13.1%) young people in the FND group suffered from an ongoing functional disorder (other than FND) at the time of vaccination (or option of vaccination) (see [Table 2](#vaccines-10-02031-t002)). One suffered from complex chronic pain (see [Table 2](#vaccines-10-02031-t002)). 3.4. Vaccination Rates in Young People with FND and Healthy Controls 3.5. Rates of FND Symptoms in Response to the COVID-19 Vaccine as Reported by the Young Person and Family [Figure 2](#vaccines-10-02031-f002). Below we provide case vignettes of the six individuals who reported adverse FND responses to the Pfizer vac-cine\u2014the only vaccine available for their age group at the time they were vaccinated. We present the cases in the order of their admission into the Mind-Body Program. In cases 2, 5, and 6\u2014one relapse and two new-onset FND\u2014the FND diagnosis was confirmed by a neurologist at our hospital. In cases 1, 3, and 4 the diagnosis was confirmed by the family doctor, who organised further physiotherapy and mental health treatment with physio-therapists and mental health clinicians. The vaccination record of all six cases is reported in [Table 3](#vaccines-10-02031-t003)and the medication history (during the FND intervention) is reported in [Supplementary Table S1](#app1-vaccines-10-02031). - Case 1. Relapse of FND symptoms post COVID-19 vaccination in a child whose FND had resolved [Table 3](#vaccines-10-02031-t003)). - Case 2. Relapse of FND symptoms post COVID-19 vaccination in a young woman whose FND had resolved but who had experienced a number of short relapses with stress [Table 3](#vaccines-10-02031-t003)). - Case 3. Worsening of FND symptoms in unresolved FND [Table 3](#vaccines-10-02031-t003)). - Case 4. Worsening of FND symptoms in unresolved FND - Case 5.

A graded return to school was organised. For the longer term, the plan was for the patient to engage in trauma-focused therapy over a 6-12 month period. - Case 6. gut disorder [ [53](#B53-vaccines-10-02031)], and FND (see [Supplementary Text Box S3](#app1-vaccines-10-02031))\u2014following her second Pfizer vaccination. The narcolepsy diagnosis was made by a sleep physician (KW) based on clinical presentation (persisting pattern of daytime sleepiness), polysomnog-raphy (short REM latency and sleep fragmentation), and a multiple sleep latency test (falling asleep on all four nap opportunities coupled with three sleep-onset REM periods). Measurements of cerebral spinal fluid orexin (hypocretin) were not available. The functional abdominal pain diagnosis was confirmed by a gastroenterologist. The FND diagnoses\u2014persistent motor weakness of the lower limbs (unrelated to sleep) and functional/dissociative seizures\u2014were confirmed by a neurologist via rule-in positive neurological signs and video EEG (gold-standard assessments) [ [38](#B38-vaccines-10-02031), [54](#B54-vaccines-10-02031), [55](#B55-vaccines-10-02031)] (see [Supplementary Text Box S3](#app1-vaccines-10-02031)). 3.6. Rate of COVID-19 Infection in Young People with FND and Healthy Controls 4. Discussion [Figure 2](#vaccines-10-02031-f002)), two young people (2/61, 3.38%) developed new-onset FND following COVID-19 vaccination; two experienced an FND relapse (2/36, 5.56%) following FND (2/20, 10.0%) experienced FND symptom exacerbation following vaccination. In the healthy control group (see [Figure 2](#vaccines-10-02031-f002)), no young people experienced new-onset FND fol-lowing COVID-19 vaccination. However, one control opted out of the vaccination program because her mother had experienced post-vaccination neurological and cardiac symptoms. This unvaccinated control case experienced long COVID after contracting COVID-19 infection. Our study findings cohere with the broader literature. While functional neurological complications following COVID-19 vaccination are rare, they do occur in a small subset of susceptible young people. Data from this small cohort suggest that in susceptible individuals, COVID-19 vaccination can trigger new-onset FND, relapse in resolved FND, unresolved FND. [Figure 2](#vaccines-10-02031-f002)). As above, the findings sug-gest that for a small subset of young people prone to FND, vaccination can function as an illness trigger. [27](#B27-vaccines-10-02031), [29](#B29-vaccines-10-02031), [30](#B30-vaccines-10-02031), [31](#B31-vaccines-10-02031), [32](#B32-vaccines-10-02031), [33](#B33-vaccines-10-02031)]. As mentioned in the introduction, other studies have reported three types of stress-related responses to vaccination: acute anxiety-related responses (cluster 1), acute-onset functional neurological symptoms (clus-ter 2), and post-immunisation illness characterised by nonspecific functional symptoms (cluster 3). An unexpected finding in the current study is that none of the participants re-ported any stress-related symptoms under clusters 1 or 2. It is possible that our open-ended question\u2014\"Did you experience any issues with the COVID-19 vaccination?\"\u2014which did not include any suggestions about what we may have been looking for, yielded a lower report rate than questions that specifically asked about the experience of particular post-vaccination symptoms. We intentionally opted to use the open-question methodology because studies with adults with FND suggest heightened suggestibility\u2014that is, heightened responsiveness to direct verbal suggestions [ [56](#B56-vaccines-10-02031)]. Heightened suggestibility is also apparent in clinical work with young people with FND\u2014so much so that careful use of language that encourages health-promoting expectations, not illness-promoting ones, is a key element of clinical practice [ [7](#B7-vaccines-10-02031), [57](#B57-vaccines-10-02031)]. In this context we preferred to err on the side of underreporting than that of overreporting (potentially as a function of suggestibility). [29](#B29-vaccines-10-02031)]\u2014FND presentations triggered by vaccination are described as having \"no apparent physiological basis\" (p. 48). This framing of the FND as a negative diagnosis\u2014as a diagnosis of exclusion having no apparent physiological basis\u2014does not meet current best practice guidelines. Guidelines highlight the importance of providing the patient with a positive diagnosis of FND (see [Supplementary Text Box S3](#app1-vaccines-10-02031)) together with an explanation of the diagnosis [ [58](#B58-vaccines-10-02031)]. In the section that follows we provide a short summary of current thinking about FND, which we hope will enable clinicians to provide patients with an explanation based on current research. Patients typically receive these explanations with gratitude, even when the clinician highlights that the explanation re-flects our best current hypothesis based on emerging research. [Figure 3](#vaccines-10-02031-f003)) [ [59](#B59-vaccines-10-02031)]. By the same token, the process of being vaccination can be conceptualised to function as a physical (bottom-up) stressor or a psychological (top-down) stressor. [61](#B61-vaccines-10-02031)]. Because the sympathetic system and HPA axis work as coupled systems, they are sometimes referred as the sympathetic-adreno-medullary (SAM) axis. When the stress response is activated, the SAM axis secretes epinephrine (adrenalin) and norepinephrine (noradrenalin), and the HPA axis secretes glucocorticoids. In this way, the vaccination as physical stressor activates multiple components of the stress system \"bottom-up\". [59](#B59-vaccines-10-02031), [62](#B62-vaccines-10-02031), [63](#B63-vaccines-10-02031), [64](#B64-vaccines-10-02031)]. Some young people may experience fear, anxiety, negative beliefs, and negative expectations pertaining to the pro-cess of vaccination\u2014having a needle. Other young people may hold beliefs about poten-tial negative outcomes of vaccination on health and wellbeing. These beliefs may reflect those held in the family, expectations communicated by media, or knowledge about an adverse outcome in a family member or friend. In this way the vaccination as a psycho-logical stressor activates multiple components of the stress system \"top-down\". [65](#B65-vaccines-10-02031), [66](#B66-vaccines-10-02031)]. The same phenomenon\u2014clusters of functional illnesses\u2014has been reported in relation to vaccination campaigns [ [33](#B33-vaccines-10-02031), [67](#B67-vaccines-10-02031), [68](#B68-vaccines-10-02031)]. For example, following the H1N1 vaccination in Taiwan and South Korea, school-based vaccination was associated with a higher proportion of cases (functional illness) than individual vaccination [ [33](#B33-vaccines-10-02031)]. Yang highlights that \"a chain reaction following the index case may attract mass media attention and is promptly spread by the people who share similar beliefs about the vaccine and its safety\" [ [33](#B33-vaccines-10-02031)] (p. 31). In this way \"top-down\" cognitive factors\u2014in this case, beliefs\u2014coupled with stress-system activation (and activation of the motor respiratory system), can set the stage for triggering an FND illness or other functional somatic symptoms (see [Supplementary Text Box S2](#app1-vaccines-10-02031)and immune-inflammatory system [ [72](#B72-vaccines-10-02031)], and subjective distress [ [2](#B2-vaccines-10-02031)]\u2014remain activated or dysregulated over time. Studies suggest that in young people with FND, the flow-on effect of this cascade of stress-related responses is sustained activation of neural (neuron-glial) networks [ [73](#B73-vaccines-10-02031), [74](#B74-vaccines-10-02031), [75](#B75-vaccines-10-02031)] coupled with an alteration of connec-tivity within and between networks [ [2](#B2-vaccines-10-02031), [11](#B11-vaccines-10-02031)]. These aberrant changes within and across networks are thought to underpin the motor, sensory, and cognitive symptoms that typify the illness [ [1](#B1-vaccines-10-02031), [2](#B2-vaccines-10-02031)]. [61](#B61-vaccines-10-02031)]. Any alteration in one of the systems\u2014for example, immunological stress such as vaccination\u2014has the potential to affect the functioning of the other system via immune-neuro and neuro-immune cross-talk [ [61](#B61-vaccines-10-02031)]. The endocrine system also takes part in this cross-talk. Important neuroimmune mechanisms\u2014presumably also relevant the cen-tral nervous system [ [86](#B86-vaccines-10-02031)]. Because microglia activate both in response to physical (includ-ing immunological) and psychological stress, they play an important role in sculping the brain in the context of early life adversity [ [76](#B76-vaccines-10-02031)]. Consequently, glial cells are hypothesised to play an important role in stress-related disorders. They are thought to function as neu-roimmune sensors of stress [ [77](#B77-vaccines-10-02031), [79](#B79-vaccines-10-02031), [87](#B87-vaccines-10-02031)] and are hypothesised to play a role triggering and maintaining aberrant neural network function in FND and other stress-related [74](#B74-vaccines-10-02031), [88](#B88-vaccines-10-02031)]. [4](#B4-vaccines-10-02031), [89](#B89-vaccines-10-02031)] of adverse child-hood experiences [ [4](#B4-vaccines-10-02031), [89](#B89-vaccines-10-02031)]. Cumulative ACEs reprogramming that prepares the young person's biological systems to mount a robust\u2014and sometimes excessive\u2014stress response in the face of future stress. At the molecular level, the effects of HPA-axis activation and glucocorticoid signalling are largely mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor that drives the genomic actions of glucocorticoids, mediating the biological embedding of experience via plasticity changes in every tissue of the body (including the brain) [ [60](#B60-vaccines-10-02031), [91](#B91-vaccines-10-02031)]. Along these lines, a recent study with adults showed that aberrant changes in neural network function were influenced by the severity of early life physical abuse and that the connectivity maps that were correlated with physical abuse overlapped with differences in gene expression in three gene clusters [ [11](#B11-vaccines-10-02031)]. [Supplementary factors re-flect the young person's inability, including the inability of the young person's biological system, to activate restorative (calming) processes that could help the mind, body, and brain return to baseline function. In this context, a range of threat-related processes\u2014both psychological and neurophysiological\u2014continue unabated and become the new norm for that person. 5. Limitations 6. Conclusions [73](#B73-vaccines-10-02031), [74](#B74-vaccines-10-02031), [75](#B75-vaccines-10-02031)] coupled with an alteration of connectivity within and between networks [ [2](#B2-vaccines-10-02031), [11](#B11-vaccines-10-02031)]. Vaccination appears to act as a physical or psychological stressor that triggers the stress system and its cascade of threat-related responses, with a final endpoint of aberrant neural network function that supports new-onset functional neurological symptoms. Akin to FND triggered via ACEs, FND triggered by vaccination requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to maximise the likelihood that the young person will return to health and wellbeing [ [97](#B97-vaccines-10-02031)]. Presence of multiple comorbidities\u2014medical or psychiatric\u2014may complicate the treatment process and adversely affect long-term outcomes.
