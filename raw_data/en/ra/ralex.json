You are required to complete a master's level program and sit for the acupuncture licensing board exam to become a licensed acupuncturist (LAc) in most states that license acupuncture. We've partnered with Phoenix's oldest and most recognized college of Chinese medicine and acupuncture, Phoenix Institute of Herbal Medicine and Acupuncture (PIHMA), to offer students the opportunity to concurrently earn a naturopathic medical degree and a master's degree in acupuncture or Chinese medicine. PIHMA's acupuncture program is accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine (ACAHM). How You Earn Your Degrees Is up to You The program can be customized to fit your needs and goals. Most students find that the program adds 12 to 18 months to their time at Sonoran. We recommend you spend at least the first two quarters doing Sonoran coursework to assess your course load, time management and finances before you consider joining the dual-degree program. Some students wait until they have completed the basic sciences at Sonoran as that knowledge helps with the classes at PIHMA. However, students have also started as soon as they arrived at Sonoran. You will need to complete the equivalent Chinese medicine courses at PIHMA before graduating from Sonoran if you choose to participate in this program. Approximately 10 percent of Sonoran students enroll in the concurrent degree program. Both programs allow you to sit for the acupuncture licensing board exam. Sonoran accepts the following PIHMA credits (grade of C or better) toward completion of the ND program's oriental medicine credits: PIHMA accepts the following credits (grade of C or higher) toward completion of the M.
