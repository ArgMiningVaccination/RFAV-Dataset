Researchers concluded the combination of beta-glucans and selenium- and a zinc-enriched postbiotic \"appears to stimulate trained immunity in association with influenza and COVID-19 mRNA vaccines.\" \"ABB C1 ImmunoEssentials provides consumers with a synergistic combination for trained immunity,\" says Gerald Dard, managing director, AB Biotek Human Nutrition and Health. \"To bring to the marketplace a preventive health solution at a time when COVID-19 and other pathogens are exposing the importance of a healthy microbiome is ground-breaking.\" Activating different types of immunity ABB C1 ImmunoEssentials is a combination of yeast-based ingredients with a beta-1,3/1,6-glucan complex and heat-treated Saccharomyces cerevisiae rich in selenium and zinc. Combining beta-glucans with selenium and zinc delivered through yeast fermentation, ABB C1 is positioned to \"close the gap between innate and adaptive immunity by empowering both.\" It offers a holistic approach by targeting innate immune response, accelerating the natural adaptive immune reaction, and controlling hyperreactivity events such as poor short-term results or longer COVID-19 symptoms. The product is available in stick packs, capsules, tablets, gummies and bulk powder. The measured effects The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in 34 volunteers who were vaccinated against influenza (Chiromas) and 38 volunteers vaccinated against COVID-19 (Comirnaty). The day after the vaccine, the participants received either the yeast-based combination or a placebo. The duration of treatment was 30 and 35 days for the influenza and COVID-19 vaccine groups, respectively. Mean levels of CD4+T cells increased from 910.7 at baseline to 1000.2 cells/\u00b5L after the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in the ABB C1 group, whereas there was a decrease from 1055.1 to 929.8 cells/\u00b5L in the placebo group. Changes of CD3+T and CD8+T lymphocytes showed a similar trend. In the COVID-19 cohort, the increases in both IgG and IgM were higher in the ABB C1 supplement than in the placebo group. \"We view this product as a new gold standard for this supplement category,\" says Carlos de Lecea, global portfolio manager and technical lead, AB Biotek Human Nutrition and Health.
