This diet originated in India thousands of years ago. It works alongside yoga to promote an all-around wellness and prevent any imbalance, which can result in a slew of ailments. Use this comprehensive post to know more about the Ayurvedic diet, how it works, foods to eat and avoid as well as pros and cons. What Is An Ayurvedic Diet? Ayurvedic diet is an eating plan based on Ayurvedic medicine. This holistic approach applies the concepts of three doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. 1. Vata (Air and space) Of the three doshas, Vata is the most powerful as it's associated with the nervous system and anything related to circulation, assimilation of food, breathing, and muscle movement. This body type is disrupted by grief, fear, and eating too soon after a meal. Anxiety, constipation, and skin problems are some of the signs of Vata imbalance. 2. Pitta (Fire and water) Pitta dosha is responsible for body temperature, metabolism, digestion, nutrition, and assimilation. It is aggravated by food that is too spicy or acidic. Common signs of pitta imbalance include muscle fatigue, fever, sensitivity to spicy food, inflammation, diarrhea, skin irritations, excessive thirst, nausea, and low blood sugar.

Its function is related to the immune and lymphatic system. Hence it's disrupted by a diet rich in processed foods and drinks, especially those containing excess water and salt. When out of balance, Kapha body types experience sinus congestion and slow digestion that increases the risk of obesity. These three types of energies constitute the physical body, spirit, and mental wellbeing. Each element commands a specific body function, and together they determine various conditions such as health, aging, diseases, and growth. How It Works Based on the principals of this diet, when the body, mind, and spirit are in harmony with the universe, it results in a desire to eat healthy food. An imbalance caused by age, injuries, [stress](https://betterme.world/articles/meditation-and-stress-how-can-meditating-reduce-anxiety/), dehydration, changes in seasons, climate, or emotions results in an unhealthy body and mind. Therefore, for Ayurvedic diet to work, you have to eat according to your dosha and focus on meals that promote a healthy inner balance. A deficiency or excess of Kapha, Vata, or Pitta also affects overall well-being. Since Ayurvedic is a complementary and alternative medicine, it can be used alongside other holistic approaches such as [yoga](https://betterme.world/articles/what-is-shakti-yoga/) and [meditation](https://betterme.world/articles/meditation-benefits-and-techniques/). Ayurvedic lifestyle provides dietary solutions geared towards preventing specific health problems and uncovering its root causes.

Foods To Eat When it comes to the foods specified in the Ayurvedic diet, it's recommended to eat foods that stimulate the six tastes: sweet, sour, bitter, astringent, pungent, and salty. This is because each taste has a unique relationship with a specific dosha. For instance, while a Pitta person prefers sweet flavors, an overload of sweet foods creates a Kapha imbalance. Therefore, after identifying your dominant dosha, use the Ayurveda food guidelines to develop meal plans that nourish your body and keep your energy balanced ( [3](https://www.ayurveda.com/resources/food-and-nutrition/food-guidelines)). Ayurveda diet recipes recommend the inclusion of fruits, grains, vegetables, spices, legumes, dairy, condiments, meat from animals, nuts, seeds, oils, herbal teas, sweeteners, and beverages.

Ayurvedic diet for weight loss is possible since it encourages healthy balanced meal plans and physical activity. It also advocates for unprocessed and nutrient-rich whole foods, which leaves less room for a high calorie diet. Whole foods are also rich in fiber, healthy fats and on top of that they help in cutting down calories ( [5](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/features/the-whole-foods-diet#1)). While there is little scientific evidence behind the favoring and avoiding of foods based on dosha, recent research shows that nutrient-dense foods and those rich in fiber, which are generally encouraged by the Ayurvedic diet, help in weight management ( [7](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320613#eggs)). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that when combined with yoga, Ayurveda lifestyle can result in [weight loss](https://betterme.world/articles/1500-calorie-diet/) ( [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3921615/)).

Some people may also have more than one body type, which further complicates the selection process. Limited Food Choices Make It Hard To Stick To The Rules For the diet to work, you have to eat specific foods and avoid others. For example, Ayurvedic diet pitta includes dry grains to avoid offsetting the oily nature of this body type. The Ayurvedic diet plan also has more rules to follow, such as those for tastes, and some of the mentioned foods may not be in season. All the principals might be confusing for someone who is just embarking on a health journey. That is why it's always best to seek professional advice before adopting any eating plan. Meal Plan (Menu) Wondering what to eat for breakfast when following Ayurvedic diet or how to start Ayurvedic diet? A typical meal plan for the day should accommodate all the six tastes yet constitute a balanced meal. Kick start digestion with salty, sour, pungent, and bitter components then complete the day by consuming sweet meals, followed by those with an astringent taste. Breakfast - Oatmeal or cereal - A glass of water or juice - Egg - Fresh fruit Lunch - Spiced chicken, beef or fish - A small bowl of rice - Easy to digest vegetables and fruits Dinner - Vegetable spiced rice - Grilled meat - Fruit Eat energy-dense foods such as whole grains, seeds, nuts, legumes, fruits, and cooked vegetables but be mindful of the nutrients that work for and against your dosha. If you get hungry, snack on seeds and nuts between the three meals. Overall, eat a moderate breakfast, a satisfying lunch, and a sparing dinner. It's without a doubt that unhealthy eating and physical inactivity contribute to the leading causes of death worldwide. This deadly combination is a main culprit for obesity, heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and cancer ( [6](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324897)). Through the Ayurvedic diet, an individual is able to focus on mindful eating of healthy balanced meals based on their dominant dosha.
