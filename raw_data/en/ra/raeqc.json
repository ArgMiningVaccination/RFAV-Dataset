The successes of the global polio eradication effort are in large part due to brave and dedicated female health workers like Masuma, who are more able than their male counterparts to enter households in more conservative areas, vaccinate children and share important information about the health benefits of vaccines. Gender dynamics play a part in polio eradication efforts in multiple ways, from women's participation in the delivery of immunization, to whether boys and girls have equal access to vaccination, to decision-making power within households and communities on whether children are vaccinated, among other factors. On behalf of the Polio Oversight Board (POB), I am pleased to introduce the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) Gender Equality Strategy 2019-2023. The Strategy provides direction and scope for advancing gender equality and strengthening gender mainstreaming in our programmatic activities as well as organizational policies and practices as we continue our determined efforts to eradicate polio. Gender equality is a fundamental human right and a powerful driver for better health outcomes globally. If gender roles, norms and relations are not adequately understood, analysed and addressed, polio interventions will not be as effective in reaching every last child with life-saving vaccines. Gender equality is central to achieving more effective and sustainable results in polio eradication. Successful gender mainstreaming means changes to the way we work both internally and externally. This Strategy therefore highlights interventions related to the GPEI's programmatic work as well as internal work environments and culture. We are fully committed to increasing women's meaningful and equal participation and leadership at all levels of the GPEI. The GPEI is committed to providing its staff, and all those it serves, an enabling, safe and inclusive work environment. This Strategy's effective implementation requires support from all partners and staff at different levels. Strengthening delivery for all requires dedicated gender expertise, scaled-up resources and a greater understanding of gender by all staff. Together with the POB and the GPEI Strategy Committee, we will regularly review results, identify challenges and make adjustments to further strengthen this Strategy's implementation. We look forward to working with all our partners and colleagues to take concrete action and decisive steps to promote gender equality, strengthen gender- responsive programming and enhance women's meaningful participation at all levels in our joint efforts to deliver a polio-free world.

The GPEI supports national partners to accelerate their progress towards polio-free status, while upholding progress on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), by identifying and responding to gender dimensions of polio eradication. The GPEI collectively works towards identifying and addressing gender-related barriers to immunization, and recognizes and addresses the diversity of people's specific needs, challenges and priorities so that our work equally benefits girls, boys, women and men, and people with diverse gender identities. The GPEI seeks to foster a professional work environment where gender equality and the empowerment of women are actively promoted by staff in all aspects of institutional processes and programmatic work. It is committed to progressing towards gender parity, increasing women's meaningful and equal participation at all levels of the programme, and to providing a safe, inclusive and respectful work environment for all staff, contractors and partners working towards a polio-free world. I IvII EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Gender roles, norms and inequalities, along with other factors such as age, race, socioeconomic background, disability, religion and caste, operate as powerful determinants of health outcomes. To reach every last child and achieve a polio-free world, the GPEI is committed to identifying and addressing gender- related barriers to immunization, communication and disease surveillance and to advancing gender equality. The GPEI also recognizes that gender-equitable organizations are more effective in delivering results and producing better outcomes. The Gender Equality Strategy 2019-2023 reiterates the GPEI's commitment to putting gender equality at the core of its programming and ensuring the equitable participation of women and men, girls and boys, benefiting all and enhancing programme quality and sustainable outcomes. This document outlines the GPEI's global strategy for gender-responsive programming with a five-year time frame (2019- 2023). It is designed as a guide for headquarters, country and regional programme and management staff and partners to integrate gender into their work. The Gender Equality Strategy defines how the GPEI approaches gender issues externally and internally, in its programming, working culture, organizational and management structures and systems. The goal of the Strategy is to generate change in the way the GPEI integrates gender issues into different aspects of its work and to deepen and improve knowledge and best practices across the GPEI. The specific objectives of the Strategy are to: (1) promote the integration of a gender perspective into various aspects of the GPEI's programming and interventions as well as organizational and management structures; (2) support countries 1 \"Meaningful participation\" means that women are not just included or represented but that they are empowered and able to make decisions and to influence the agenda and functioning of the GPEI, at all levels of the partnershipin addressing gender-related barriers to polio vaccination to increase vaccination coverage; (3) increase women's meaningful participation1 at the diverse levels of the polio programme to work towards greater gender parity across the partnership; and (4) create gender-equitable institutional environments. The present Strategy is designed to support the work carried out by GPEI staff and contractors at headquarters, at regional offices and at the country level, as well as by the GPEI oversight, advisory and management bodies. It is also useful in informing GPEI partners at the country, regional and headquarter levels, including national governments, donors, United Nations (UN) agencies, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), civil society organizations and other cooperating partners, about the GPEI's approach and focus areas on gender. This Strategy is based on an inclusive and consultative process across the partnership. It builds on the results and feedback obtained through a comprehensive baseline assessment of the GPEI's current state of gender responsiveness, conducted in 2018, including an online survey completed by 634 GPEI staff working in the five GPEI organizations in the polio-endemic countries, regional offices and headquarters, as well as national governments. An action plan, including a communication plan, will jointly be developed by GPEI organizations and offices to operationalize the Strategy. A monitoring and evaluation plan and assigned responsibilities will be tailored to meet the specific needs and challenges encountered within different country contexts. \u00a9 UNICEF/Nigeria I I GENDER EQUALITY STRATEGY I 2019-2023 vIIIPolio vaccinator marks a girl's pinky finger outside her home in Afghanistan's Laghman province after she received the oral polio vaccine \u00a9 WHO/S Ramo INTRODUCTION Gender roles, norms and inequalities, along with other factors such as age, race, disability and socioeconomic background, operate as powerful determinants of health outcomes. To reach every last child and achieve a polio-free world, the GPEI is committed to identifying and addressing gender-related barriers to immunization, communication and disease surveillance and to advancing gender equality. This Gender Equality Strategy is a guiding document reiterating the GPEI's commitment to putting gender equality at the core of its programming and ensuring the equitable participation of women and men, girls and boys, benefiting all and enhancing programme quality. It is grounded in the growing body of evidence that health and immunization programmes designed and executed with a gender focus produce better and more sustainable outcomes.2,3 It is also underpinned by evidence highlighting that gender-equitable and diverse organizations produce more effective results.4,5 This document outlines the GPEI's global strategy for gender-responsive programming with a five-year time frame (2019-2023). The Strategy will be updated after a midterm review and based on learning that emerges from programme implementation. It is designed as a guide for headquarters, country and regional programme and management staff and partners to integrate gender into their work. An action plan, including a communication plan, will be developed to operationalize the Strategy, tailored to meet the specific needs and challenges encountered within different country contexts. The Gender Equality Strategy defines how the GPEI approaches gender issues in its programming, working culture, organizational and management structures and systems. The goal of the Strategy is to generate change in the way the GPEI integrates gender issues into different aspects of work and to deepen and improve knowledge and best practices across organizations forming the Initiative. The Strategy is aligned with, and further elaborates on, the strategic gender approaches outlined in the GPEI Polio Endgame Strategy 2019-2023. The Gender Equality Strategy is based on the GPEI's understanding that gender-related barriers to immunization operate at multiple levels, from the individual and the household to the community, hindering access to immunization services.

An integral part of reaching every last child with vaccines is also the increased participation of women in immunization activities. Understanding and awareness of how gender norms, roles and inequalities affect development, health and emergency outcomes are critical to the GPEI's work. If gender dynamics, roles and norms are not considered, polio interventions will not be as effective in reaching every last child with life-saving vaccines, and they may exacerbate existing gender inequalities. This Strategy outlines the case for gender integration as a critical issue for the GPEI and is based on an inclusive and consultative process across the partnership. It builds on the results and feedback obtained through a comprehensive baseline assessment of the GPEI's current state of gender responsiveness, conducted in 2018, including an online survey completed by 634 GPEI staff working in the five GPEI organizations in the polio-endemic countries, regional offices and headquarters, as well as national governments. The Strategy was developed with feedback and input from GPEI donors, members of the GPEI Strategy Committee, the POB, country, regional and headquarter office staff, civil society organizations, regional polio advisers, and gender experts at WHO and UNICEF, and it was critically reviewed and endorsed by the POB.

The Gender Equality Strategy is intended primarily as a guideline for GPEI staff working to eradicate polio in the BMGF, the CDC, Rotary International, UNICEF and WHO, including staff working in country and regional offices as well as at headquarters. For other GPEI stakeholders, the Strategy will provide a clear understanding of the GPEI's priorities and planned work on gender. I I GENDER EQUALITY STRATEGY I 2019-2023 4BACKGROUND \"the process of assessing the implications for women and men of any planned action, including legislation, policies or programmes, in all areas at all levels. It is a strategy for making women's as well as men's concerns and experiences an integral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes ... so that women and men benefit equally and inequality is not perpetuated. The ultimate goal is to achieve gender equality.\"9,10 The empowerment of women often forms an important part of gender mainstreaming, since in most contexts women continue to be largely disadvantaged in relation to men. However, gender mainstreaming in polio eradication is not solely about women or women's issues but about gender inequalities, norms, roles and relations, underpinned by power relations that also impact men, communities and organizations as a whole. It is therefore also important to engage men and boys when designing and implementing gender-responsive programmes to advance gender equality. Gender mainstreaming has been an explicit strategy in international development, health and humanitarian programming since the Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995 in Beijing, when the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution establishing gender mainstreaming as a UN systemwide policy. In addition to the 1995 Beijing Declaration, building on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (1979) and the World Conference on Human Rights (vienna, 1993), strong foundations for gender mainstreaming requirements include the SDGs, particularly SDG5 on gender equality and women's empowerment, in addition to SDG3 on good health and well-being and SDG10 on 8 \"Gender\" refers to \"the socially constructed characteristics of women and men - such as norms, roles and relationships of and between groups of women and men It varies from society to society and can be changed\" See World Health Organization: Gender, equity and human rights [website] (https://www whoint/gender-equity-rights/understanding/gender-definition/en/, accessed 14 May 2019) 9 Definition of the concept of gender mainstreaming: United Nations Economic and Social Council's agreed conclusions 1997/2 (https://www unorg/womenwatch/osagi/pdf/ECOSOCAC19972PDF, accessed 15 May 2019) 10 See also Polio Global Eradication Initiative FAQs: Gender & Polio Eradication (http://polioeradicationorg/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ polio-vaccination-gender-FAQ-Frequently-Asked-Questions-GPEI_Gender-and-Polio_20180710pdf, accessed 15 May 2019) BACKGROUND I I 5reduced inequalities. Additionally, the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, the principal global intergovernmental body dedicated to the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women, has a leading role in monitoring and reviewing progress in the implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, and in mainstreaming a gender perspective in UN activities.11 Moreover, World Health Assembly resolution WHA60.2512 urges all Member States to integrate gender analysis into strategic and operational planning and formulate national strategies to address gender issues in health policies, programmes and research, ensuring that a gender equality perspective is incorporated in all levels of health care delivery and services. The resolution also specifically calls for the collection and analysis of sex-disaggregated data to inform health policy and programmes. Gender analysis, a requirement for effective gender mainstreaming and a vetted social science tool, is used to identify and understand the different roles, opportunities and power dynamics that exist between women and men in a specific context. It identifies gender disparities, examines why such disparities exist and looks at how these disparities could be addressed. Gender analysis in health can highlight differences in, for instance, risk factors and vulnerability, access to health services and decision-making processes related to health, and access to and control over resources. A thorough gender analysis of polio eradication is included in the 2018 GPEI Technical Brief: Gender.13 The following section summarizes key points covered in the Brief. GENDER AND POLIO Gender roles and norms, and their underpinning power relations, are powerful determinants of health outcomes.14 Gender-related barriers to immunization 11 See, for instance, UN Economic and Social Council Commission on the Status of Women Sixty-third session, 11-22 March 2019 (E/CN6/2019/3) Social protection systems, access to public services and sustainable infrastructure for gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls Report of the Secretary-General; 2019 12 Resolution WHA6025 Strategy for integrating gender analysis and actions into the work of WHO In: World Health Assembly First Special Session, Geneva, 9 November 2006 Resolutions and decision, annex Sixtieth World Health Assembly, Geneva, 14-23 May 2007 Resolutions and decisions, annexes Geneva: World Health Organization; 2007:92-3 (WHASS1/2006-WHA60/2007/REC/1; http://appswhoint/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHASSA_WHA60-Rec1/E/ WHASS1_WHA60REC1-enpdf, accessed 12 July 2019) 13 Global Polio Eradication Initiative Technical brief: gender Geneva: World Health Organization; 2018 (https://appswhoint/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/325912/ WHO-POLIO-1805-engpdf, accessed 15 May 2019) 14 A thorough gender analysis of polio eradication is included in the GPEI Technical brief: gender Geneva: World Health Organization; 2018 15 Bauer GR, Scheim AI Methods for analytic intercategorical intersectionality in quantitative research: Discrimination as a mediator of health inequalities Soc Sci Med 2019; 226:236-45 16 Martin Hilber A, Bosch-Capblanch X, Schindler C, Beck L, S\u00e9cula F, Oran McKenzie O et al Gender and immunisation: Summary report for SAGE Geneva: sn; 2010 17 Bosch-Capblanch X, Banerjee K, Burton A Unvaccinated children in years of increasing coverage: how many and who are they? Evidence from 96 low- and middle-income countries Trop Med Int Health 2012; 17:697-710operate at multiple levels, from the individual and the household to the community, hindering access to immunization services. An integral part of reaching every last child with vaccines in the last remaining strongholds of polio is also the increased participation of women in immunization activities. Health interventions cannot effectively meet the needs of all unless informed by gender-sensitive analyses and data disaggregated by sex and other crucial variables such as age, ethnicity, disability and socioeconomic status. Intersectional analysis15 highlights how different forms of marginalization and discrimination are often intertwined and overlapping, underlining the need for analysing data by gender and by other social stratifiers influencing health outcomes. Gender is relational, operating between people and across social factors. Gender determinants of health do not act alone but with individual, household, communal factors and institutional barriers. A multiplicity of gender-related factors affect children's immunization status. From son and male preference to maternal education, the relevant gender dimensions of childhood immunization vary between and within countries. Girls' and boys' vulnerability to polio Worldwide, a child's sex does not have a significant influence on immunization status. A report of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization on 67 countries found no significant difference between the immunization coverage of girls and boys.16 Subsequent studies have confirmed the lack of gender disparity in immunization coverage. A study specifically investigating unvaccinated children (having received no doses) across 96 countries also confirmed no significant gender differences.17 Nevertheless, within countries and regions, there are notable variations, where immunization coverage is higher for girls in some places and higher for boys in others. For instance, girls receive lower immunization I I GENDER EQUALITY STRATEGY I 2019-2023 6coverage in south-central Asia.18 Additionally, gender interacts with other factors, such as socioeconomic status, ethnicity and disability, to affect immunization and overall health status. An important exception is India, where one study found that gender was significantly associated with poliovirus seropositivity.19 Girls were also associated with missed polio vaccination in another Indian study.20 Although gender disparities in immunization are not widespread, the preferential treatment of boys is perpetuated in certain contexts. Countries with higher levels of gender inequality have been associated with lower, less equitable levels of immunization. Anecdotally, there have been cases where, due to harmful rumours about the effects of the polio vaccine, caregivers have not vaccinated their sons but have opted to give the vaccine to their daughters. 18 Addressing sex and gender in epidemic-prone infectious diseases Geneva: World Health Organization; 2007 19 Giri S, Praharaj I, Karthikeyan AS, Babji S et al Factors determining anti-poliovirus type 3 antibodies among orally immunised Indian infants Vaccine 2015; 34:4979-84 20 Jain S, P B, Singh S, Singla A, Kundu H, Singh K Polio Eradication-Lessons from the past and future perspective J Clin Diagn Res 2014; 8:ZC56-ZC60More social research is needed to examine the ways in which gender impacts boys' and girls' vaccination status in different contexts, accounting also for subnational differences within countries. Decision-making power to access immunization Since polio mostly affects children aged under 2 years, parents or caregivers are the critical decision-makers for allowing a child's access to immunization. The type of decisions they make, their power to make decisions and their available resources to act on those decisions are all influenced by gender. The compounding of social and physical barriers for women in patriarchal societies constrains their capacity to provide health care to their children (see Fig. 1). Fig. 1. Gender-related barriers to immunization In many areas, women's lower literacy levels and lack of access to information impact access to vaccines and health services for themselves and their children. Gender inequalities in many places have restricted women's decision-making power about their children's health, including receiving vaccinations. Due to gender norms, in some societies only women can access households to interact with mothers and deliver polio vaccines to their children. Women's participation is critical for polio eradication. Lower education levels for women have been sho wn to be directly linked to lower immunization levels for their children.In some societies, boys are more valued, with their health needs prioritized over girls '. Women in some areas may not be allowed to travel to the health centre alone to get vaccines and health care for themselves and their children. Where gender inequality persists, women often lack access to resources like money, transportation and time that are needed for seeking health services for themselves and their children. Gender barriers operate with, and are affected by, several other barriers including socio-economic background, age, disability and ethnicity. GENDER BARRIERS TO IMMUNIZATION Source: GPEI Gender Infographics [website] Geneva: World Health Organization (http://polioeradicationorg/gender-and-polio/gender-and-polio- eradication/, accessed 20 May 2019) Mothers are at the intersection of two conflicting sets of demands; on the one hand they are seen as responsible for care including children's health but, on the other, they may lack the resources and autonomy to seek out health care. A woman's autonomy affects her ability to access health services for herself and her children. Women's BACKGROUND I I 7agency and decision-making have been significantly associated with children's immunization status.21 The higher the mother's agency, the more likely she will immunize her children. Where women lack autonomy, they may require spousal permission to immunize their children. Mothers who perceive that spousal permission is required for their child's immunization are less likely to fully immunize their child.22 Education and literacy Although paternal education is also associated with a child's immunization status, lower educational levels of maternal caregivers are more commonly related to under-vaccination in lower- and middle-income countries.23 A comprehensive review of immunization equity found that the greatest disparity exists for children with uneducated mothers.24 A mother's individual educational level as well as the literacy rate of her community are important factors for a child's complete immunization. Access to resources Access to and control over resources are other limiting factors for accessing vaccination services. When mothers have to travel to receive vaccinations for their children, they incur costs, even if the vaccination itself is free. Travel imposes direct costs associated with transportation and indirect costs associated with wage loss and unpaid care work in the home including childcare. Where gender norms preclude mothers from travelling alone, mothers face the additional burden of arranging a guardian or suitable companion to travel with them. Gender and immunization delivery Gender norms around acceptable interactions between women and men shape and determine the delivery of immunization.

Unrelated men are generally not permitted to enter Muslim households if women are alone with their children.25 In certain cultural contexts, such as in the Nigerian Hausa tradition, unrelated men may not speak to women without permission from their husbands.26 Because of these religious and social customs, women may be prevented from receiving health care services from men, especially at the household level. In contexts where having an open conversation with a male health worker is not possible, it is imperative that female front-line workers (FLW) be available to speak to women and deliver health services. In the GPEI's immunization activities, female FLWs have also increased the effectiveness of health service delivery, and in many settings only women can access households and vaccinate infant children inside the household. Female social mobilizers have improved attitudes towards polio vaccination and the perceptions of risks associated with the disease.27 All-male vaccinator teams, on the other hand, were found to be ineffective, posing a critical gender-related barrier to polio eradication efforts.28 In Nigeria, for example, all-male vaccination teams were unable to engage with young mothers during polio supplementary immunization activities.29 A review of polio immunization in Afghanistan from 1997 to 2013 suggested that mothers' refusals were related to interactions with all-male vaccination teams. Women also demonstrate gender preferences for FLWs, as there is generally greater demand from mothers for female vaccinators and social mobilizers.30 The Female Community volunteers (FCv) initiative, reinitiated in areas of \"super high-risk Union Councils\" in Pakistan in 2014, has also shown how an increase in female FLWs' participation brings about better results for polio eradication. The FCv strategy, I I GENDER EQUALITY STRATEGY I 2019-2023 8with strong community participation, has greatly contributed to breaking down long-existing barriers to polio vaccination for the hardest-to-reach and most vulnerable people in Sindh and Balochistan. Local FCvs go from house to house to administer oral polio vaccine to children, in addition to regular health camps. In Balochistan, at the start of the programme, only 31 As of April 2019, Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan60% of the lot quality assurance sampling surveys evaluating community health worker performance were passing, with 80% of them failing with more than eight children missed. A year after the community- based vaccination programme started, the proportion of lots passing had increased to 92%. A polio team marking a door in Ravi Town, Lahore during NID III \u00a9 WHO/A Khan ASSESSMENT OF GPEI GENDER RESPONSIVENESS A thorough baseline assessment was carried out to guide the development of a targeted and relevant Gender Equality Strategy for the GPEI and to assess the current state of GPEI gender responsiveness. A GPEI-wide staff survey, completed by 634 polio personnel in the polio-endemic countries31 as well as at headquarters and regional offices in June 2018, examined the knowledge levels and attitudes, and current practices, of staff and GPEI partners, while highlighting critical gaps and challenges related to gender mainstreaming within the GPEI.In addition to a staff survey, the current state of gender parity in staffing in the different organizations forming the GPEI, as well as key polio oversight and advisory bodies, was examined. A content analysis of key GPEI publications was carried out to measure the extent to which they have to date incorporated gender considerations. The baseline analysis highlighted that, although gender is a significant determinant of health outcomes and a key focus area for many critical GPEI donors, the GPEI has remained largely gender blind. However, the GPEI survey results also indicated that the majority of GPEI partners and staff at different levels recognize the importance of considering gender issues in polio programming and show willingness to do so. The analysis of the GPEI survey results, the current state of gender parity, as well as the absence of gender considerations in key GPEI documents and BACKGROUND I I 9publications indicate a strong need for the GPEI to take decisive steps to adequately mainstream gender into its work. Summary of GPEI gender assessment results GPEI staff survey Of 634 GPEI partners and staff who took part in the survey, 79% work at WHO and 11% at UNICEF; 21% are women and 78% are men. 91% of respondents indicated that the GPEI needs a gender strategy. Of all UNICEF respondents, 35% reported recalling gender being discussed \"regularly\", compared to only 17% of WHO respondents. 36% reported needing technical support to be able to integrate gender considerations in their work and 33% stated needing training on gender and polio issues. 66% stated never having received any training related to gender. 94% of WHO and UNICEF respondents working at headquarters indicated it is important to collect and analyse sex-disaggregated data, compared to 76% in the country offices. 78% of GPEI staff and partners who took part in the survey were not aware of the programme's gender-sensitive indicators developed in 2017 and 32 P-grade staff fall in the Professional category in the UN system, while G-level staff fall in the General Service category covered in the GPEI semi-annual status reports since April 2018. 75% strongly agreed with the statement that women and men should be treated equally. Only 36% of female respondents \"strongly agreed\" that women and men are treated equally in their organization. Only 5% of women working in polio at WHO headquarters \"strongly agreed\" that women and men are treated equally, with the majority of women (60%) either somewhat or strongly disagreeing with the statement. Of all respondents, 37% stated that, based on their knowledge and experiences, sexual harassment is a very serious issue in the polio programme. When asked about gender-based discrimination, 36% of polio staff responded that it is a \"very serious issue\". Of all female respondents, 78% indicated it is either \"somewhat an issue\" or a \"very serious issue\", compared with 69% of male respondents. Of all respondents, 78% were aware of a mechanism in their workplace to lodge an official complaint to report sexual harassment, abuse and/or gender- based discrimination. Gender parity (status in June 2018) Women comprise 24% of all WHO polio staff at headquarters and the five WHO regions; women constitute 28% of all P-grade32 staff and 25% of all G-level staff (see Fig. 2).

All 21 G-grade staff currently working at headquarters are women, and women hold 43% of all P-level posts. Of all senior-level polio staff (P4 and above) at headquarters, 56% are men. All D1- and D2-level (Directors) posts are held by men. Women comprise 8% of all polio staff in the WHO country office in Afghanistan, 17% of all polio staff in Nigeria and 22% in Pakistan. Of all UNICEF polio staff, 36% are women and 64% are men. Women comprise 40% of all P-grade polio staff at UNICEF and 38% of all G-level staff. 33 Gender mainstreaming in WHO: where are we now? Report of the baseline assessment of the WHO Gender Strategy Geneva: World Health Organization; 2011 At UNICEF headquarters, women constitute 56% of all polio staff. Women currently hold 55% of all P-level posts and 57% of G-level posts at headquarters. Of the senior-level staff positions (P4 and above) at UNICEF headquarters, 50% are women. In the UNICEF Afghanistan country office, women comprise 26% of all polio staff, whereas the figure is 43% in Nigeria and 28% in Pakistan. At Rotary International, 78% of polio staff are women; at BMGF, 56% are women and at CDC, 48% (see Fig. 3). Fig. 3. Polio staff distribution at the BMGF, CDC, and Rotary International oversight bodies and advisory groups are largely led by men. The POB, which oversees the management and implementation of the GPEI through its core partner agencies, is currently formed of four men and one woman. The Strategy Committee, formed by the heads of agencies of the core GPEI partner organizations, is currently comprised of three men and two women. Technical Advisory Groups (TAGs), which review progress towards polio eradication and provide technical advice on strategies, priorities and programme operations, are also largely male- led. For instance, all members of the November 2017 TAG in Afghanistan and Pakistan were men. Women are also largely absent from the TAGs' \"technical adviser\" category, with only two in 10 advisers being women in the November 2017 TAG in Afghanistan, and one in 17 in Pakistan Gender in GPEI documents A content analysis was carried out to measure the extent to which recent GPEI publications (from 2016 onwards) promote or use gender analysis or sex-disaggregated data. A total of 16 GPEI publications were selected from the GPEI website, covering categories of: (1) country-specific National Emergency Action Plans (NEAPs) in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria; (2) annual and semi-annual GPEI reports; and (3) tools/normative guidelines and standard operating procedures (SOPs). The content analysis matrix and methodology were modified and adapted from the WHO publication Gender Mainstreaming in WHO: where are we now?33 BACKGROUND I I 11GPEI document content analysis The content analysis of GPEI documents focused on the following questions: Does the document include one or more \"explicit\" statements/references to gender equality or gender equity? (a one-off reference to having women in vaccination teams is not counted) Does the document refer to consultation/ partnerships with women's groups? Does the document recommend the use of sex-disaggregated data? Does the document use/present sex-disaggregated data, where relevant? Does the document analyse/interpret the differences between women's and men's outcomes, needs, roles, norms (i.e. gender analysis)? Does the document specify at least one action/ recommendation to address gender issues?Overall, 740 pages of a total of 16 GPEI documents published on the GPEI website from 2016 to 2018 were examined for the content analysis. In addition to the above questions, specific keywords commonly included in gender-responsive documents were searched in each document, including \"gender\", \"sex\", \"equity\", \"equality\", \"women\" and \"girls\". Notably, only three of 16 documents included the word \"gender\" while only one included \"equality\". The key guiding document of the GPEI, the Polio Eradication & Endgame Strategic Plan 2013-2018, mentioned gender once, but only in the context of the polio programme's achievements in addressing gender barriers, without including any analysis or background of the content or dynamics of these barriers. However, the updated Polio Endgame Strategy 2019-2023 addresses gender issues systematically. The majority of the reviewed GPEI documents did not contain any gender analysis or sex-disaggregated data. Notable exceptions are the two latest GPEI semi-annual reports, published in 2018, which explicitly mention gender issues, use and promote sex-disaggregated data, include gender analyses and specify actions to address gender inequalities.

For the GPEI to strengthen its gender responsiveness, a gender perspective needs to be systematically mainstreamed into the different stages of programme planning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation at various levels (see Fig. 4). Fig. 4. Gender-responsive programming ImplementationMonitoring & evaluationProgramme planning & designGender analysis Gender-sensitive indicators Equal participation at all stagesCollection, analysis and use of sex-disaggregated data Source: WHO The gender-responsive assessment scale developed by WHO defines five levels of gender responsiveness, categorizing programmes as gender unequal, gender blind, gender sensitive, gender specific or gender transformative (see Fig. 5). Fig. 5. WHO gender-responsive assessment scale Gender unequal Gender blind Gender sensitiveGender specic Gender transformativeGender analysis GPEI goalSource: WHO I I GENDER EQUALITY STRATEGY I 2019-2023 14Gender-unequal programmes (level 1) perpetuate gender inequalities by reinforcing unbalanced norms, roles and relations and privileging men over women (or vice versa). Gender-blind programming (level 2) ignores gender roles, norms and relations and the differences in opportunities and resource allocations for women and men, girls and boys. Gender-sensitive programming (level 3) considers gender roles, norms and relations while not necessarily addressing inequality generated by gender norms and roles. Gender-specific programming (level 4) acknowledges various norms and roles for women and men and how they influence the access to and control over resources, and takes into account the specific needs of girls, women, boys and men. Gender- transformative programming (level 5) goes beyond this by also including ways to transform harmful gender roles, norms and relations, with the objective of promoting gender equality. The actions presented in this Gender Equality Strategy aim to ensure the GPEI approaches are, at a minimum, gender sensitive in all aspects, combined with gender- specific and gender-transformative approaches. The selected approaches, to be elaborated in specific action plans, will depend on current baselines and existing restraints and challenges in a given country context/programmatic setting. Gender analysis and project management A gender analysis is used to identify and understand the different roles, opportunities and power dynamics that exist between women and men in a specific context. Gender analyses in health and immunization can highlight differences in, for example, risk factors and vulnerability, access to health services, resources such as money, information and transportation, as well as decision-making processes related to vaccination. Conducting a gender analysis is a key component of gender-responsive programming and gender mainstreaming and is therefore a crucial area for GPEI focus in diverse aspects of its work. The GPEI will: implement gender-responsive interventions and systematically integrate a gender perspective into programme design, implementation, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation; 34 \"Gender\" refers to \"the socially constructed characteristics of women and men - such as norms, roles and relationships of and between groups of women and men\" include a gender analysis component in all relevant publications, including polio eradication strategies, contributions to NEAPs, communications/ communications for development (C4D) strategies and plans, technical reports, project proposals and SOPs; systematically incorporate a gender analysis (including GPEI gender-sensitive indicators) into key presentations and briefings on polio to internal and external audiences; ensure women, men, boys and girls of diverse backgrounds are equally consulted and participate in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of programmatic interventions affecting them, making sure their perspectives and voices are heard and integrated; introduce, monitor and enforce the use of gender guidelines to support staff in integrating gender into technical reports, funding proposals and other relevant publications; ensure budgets include specific allocations for gender equality-related considerations; gather and analyse further data and evidence around gender and polio with a focus on understanding and addressing gender-related barriers to immunization; ensure that in all GPEI publications, gender is defined in a manner consistent with global norms (e.g. the WHO definition34), moving away from conflating \"gender\" with \"women\" and only the participation of female FLWs; and widely publish and disseminate the 2018 GPEI Technical brief: gender and other GPEI publications, tools and success stories on gender and polio among staff, partners and external audiences at all levels. Collecting, analysing and using sex- disaggregated data The collection, analysis and use of sex-disaggregated data are a crucial component of gender-responsive programming. Collecting and analysing data disaggregated by sex allows the programme to track that girls and boys are equally reached with vaccines and through polio surveillance, and ensure that any gender discrepancies found can be effectively tackled and addressed. In addition to collecting data STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK I I 15disaggregated by sex, it is also crucial to address intersectionality and collect data disaggregated by other variables influencing health outcomes, such as ethnicity, age, religion, disability, geographic area (urban/rural and/or relevant geographic unit) and socioeconomic background. Collecting sex-disaggregated data about polio FLWs and staff is also important in order for the programme to monitor gender parity and work towards reaching set targets for the equal participation of women and men. All GPEI publications and reports should present data disaggregated by sex and other social stratifiers where relevant and available. The GPEI will: ensure that all relevant programmatic data are disaggregated by sex and other critical variables and that these data are analysed to find and address existing gaps; provide training for all relevant staff on the importance of and requirements for collecting and analysing disaggregated data; 35 As of April 2019, Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan 36 As of April 2019, the outbreak and high-risk countries include Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Guinea, Iraq, Kenya, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Liberia, Madagascar, Mali, Mozambique, Myanmar, Niger, Papua New Guinea, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Syrian Arab Republic and Ukraine ensure that a standardized system for data collection and reporting is in place with clear lines of accountability; and systematically use, publicize and present these data in relevant GPEI publications, presentations and reports, including the GPEI semi-annual status reports and annual reports, key polio eradication strategy documents, SOPs as well as country- specific annual reports, progress reports, TAG reports and NEAPs for polio eradication. Gender-sensitive indicators To ensure equal access to vaccinations and the engagement of women, in 2017 the GPEI developed four gender-sensitive indicators for monitoring progress, which have been covered in the GPEI semi-annual status reports every six months since 2018. The indicators measure whether girls and boys are reached equally with polio vaccines, the total doses received by girls and boys, the timeliness of surveillance for girls and boys, as well as women's participation as FLWs (see Table 3).

These indicators will be further elaborated in the individual action plans developed to operationalize this Strategy, and will be monitored by third-party evaluators (see Fig. 6).

Women are able to actively participate as vaccinators and social mobilizers in polio vaccination campaigns. MONITORING FOR GENDER EQUALITY Source: GPEI Gender Infographics [website] Geneva: World Health accessed 20 May 2019) The GPEI will: collect data on all four indicators for polio- endemic countries, and on acute flaccid paralysis surveillance indicators (2 and 3) for all outbreak and at-risk countries; regularly monitor the gender-sensitive indicators and publicly report on them semi-annually; whenever any gender discrepancies are found, find reasons for these gaps and support countries in addressing them through appropriate interventions (e.g. targeted communications/C4D strategies); develop further gender-sensitive and gender- specific indicators to monitor performance and measure results through specific action plans; and include data on the indicators in relevant polio briefings, updates, reports and publications, and disseminate them widely. STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK I I 17Gender-responsive communications An example of a photo not reinforcing typical gender stereotypes: a man from Kandahar, southern Afghanistan, holds his baby as he waits for the child to be vaccinated \u00a9 WHO/JJalali Communication plays a crucial role in the effort to reach all children aged under 5 years with polio vaccines, and to convince caretakers of the importance of having repeated doses of the vaccine. It is therefore important to mainstream gender into diverse communication interventions and activities and to ensure that the GPEI adopts gender-sensitive and gender-responsive approaches in all communications. In the design stage of communications/C4D interventions, a gender analysis should be consistently conducted, assessing the roles of, and relations between, women and men and girls and boys, and identifying how gender and other crucial variables, such as age, disability and ethnicity, influence experiences, needs, capacities, specific vulnerabilities, access to and control over resources, barriers and priorities. The GPEI will avoid gender-blind communication plans and strategies that assume that gender plays no role, for instance, in the selection of appropriate messages and the delivery mechanisms and channels for these messages. All GPEI communication materials and tools, from both external and internal communications to behaviour change and community engagement messages, must portray women, girls, men and boys equitably. By doing this, the GPEI contributes towards transforming attitudes and behaviours related to gender inequality and women's exclusion and marginalization. The GPEI will also ensure that women, girls, boys and men are equally consulted during an initial situational analysis as well as the design, testing, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation stages of communication interventions. The GPEI will refrain from reproducing harmful gender stereotypes portraying traditional female/ male roles but will aim to present women's voices in areas traditionally occupied by male voices, and vice versa. For example, in official communication materials, the GPEI will avoid portraying women as passive and inherently vulnerable, and will highlight women's agency and power to make decisions, and the positive change achieved by women's contributions and actions within polio eradication. The principles for gender-inclusive written and oral communications also apply to audiovisual materials, such as videos, photographs and infographics. The GPEI will avoid stereotypical portrayals of men and women in terms of norms and expected behaviours, the division of labour, and access and control over resources. In addition to choosing and using photos that show women in non-traditional and non-stereotypical roles and professions, and I I GENDER EQUALITY STRATEGY I 2019-2023 18displaying equal numbers of women and men in images in general, the GPEI will ensure that the overall portrayal of women conveys messages of equal status. The GPEI will also avoid conflating the issue of \"gender\" with \"women\" and \"women's issues\" in its official publications. The GPEI will consistently apply gender-transformative C4D approaches according to UNICEF's existing guidelines37 by, for instance, engaging fathers to take on a more active role in child-rearing and by promoting decision-making over health issues among women. It is crucial that the design of polio materials, messages and interventions consider and challenge negative gender norms, and that they take into account the way in which gender impacts differences in access to information and services. It is essential to also ensure that all communications be sensitive to diversity in gender identity and sexual orientation and avoid reproducing a typical gender dichotomy of women/men. For instance, when issuing research surveys and polls, it is good practice not to limit the options to female/male, woman/man, but to allow space for other possible gender identities. All communication materials that portray individuals must always take into account the local context and guarantee the safety of the individuals involved. The GPEI will: include gender analysis, gender equality and women's empowerment as integral elements in all communication plans, guidelines, strategies and action plans; include gender analysis and the collection, evaluation and use of data disaggregated by sex and other crucial variables as critical components of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of all polio-related communications/ C4D interventions and activities; integrate gender considerations into all communications/C4D-related surveys, research and polls, and ensure that the results of such research are also disaggregated by sex and other variables, such as age, ethnicity and disability, and presented with a gender analysis; 37 Gender-Responsive Communication for Development: Guidance, Tools and Resources Kathmandu: UNICEF South Asia; 2018 38 See, for instance, Gender-inclusive language guidelines: Promoting gender equality through the use of language New York: UN Women (http://www unwomenorg/-/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/library/gender-inclusive%20language/guidelines-on-gender-inclusive-language-en pdf?la=en&vs=2129), and Principles Seal Initiative (https://www undporg/content/dam/ jamaica/docs/gender/JM-AUG-29-UNDP%20Gender%20Seal-Principles%20of%20gender-sensitive%20communicationspdf) accessed 17 May 2019 ensure women, men, girls and boys are equally consulted, and their specific needs, barriers, views and preferences are taken into account when designing, testing and delivering communication interventions; consistently apply gender-transformative C4D approaches during the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of communication interventions according to UNICEF's existing guidelines;37 establish a gender review process for the development and implementation of all polio C4D interventions in the country offices of the endemic countries, led by the polio and country office gender focal points who are the staff responsible for supporting gender mainstreaming; ensure that communication materials, publications and tools do not contain harmful gender stereotypes; ensure that women and men are seen, heard and treated equally in media products and messages, and that quotes from both men and women are included in press releases, web stories, videos, photoessays and other communication pieces; develop and disseminate specific tools to support communications and programme staff in utilizing a gender-responsive approach, including key message documents and FAQ documents; use inclusive language in all official communication and refrain from using exclusionary forms of language (for example the use of \"he\"/\"his\" when actually referring to both women and men);38 portray and refer to women as equal and active participants, not merely as mothers and caretakers, in all aspects of polio eradication; ensure gender balance and the diversity of speakers and thematic experts in polio-related events, workshops and panels; and apply the principles of gender-sensitive communications also to audiovisual materials, such as photographs, videos and infographics. STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK I I 19Training of volunteer vaccinators in Afghanistan See \"Assessment of GPEI gender responsiveness\" in this document for a more detailed breakdown 40 These figures include Professional and General Service UN staff but not FLWs, such as vaccinators and social mobilizersORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE AND SYSTEMS To achieve the projected objectives of this Gender Equality Strategy, change within the GPEI is required at the technical level (addressing capacities, systems and instruments for gender mainstreaming), at the policy level (including commitment, prioritizing and decision-making) and at the organizational cultural level, where routine attitudes and behaviours form and sustain the environment and daily activities within the GPEI organizations. In addressing the challenges of commitment, leadership, accountability and capacity, adjustments are required not only in the work that the GPEI carries out but also in how the work is done. The successful implementation of this Gender Equality Strategy relies on systems of accountability for gender results, and reshaping the culture of the GPEI organizations by tackling attitudes, beliefs and behaviours. Commitment to gender must be sustained and sincere, with the full engagement of men and women, spanning from senior management down to all levels, and effectively integrated into systems, ways of working and the overall organizational culture within the GPEI. The implementation of this Strategy and its action plan will regularly be monitored and reviewed by the POB, GPEI's principal internal oversight mechanism. The GPEI is committed to increasing the prominence of gender considerations in its organizational values, working culture, and management systems and structures. To foster a more gender-responsive value system, the GPEI leadership will affirm its commitment to gender integration across the partnership and promote the adoption of the Strategy at the country programme, regional and headquarter levels. Gender parity Gender balance in GPEI staffing mirrors the GPEI's commitment to gender equality. Currently, the GPEI is not on track to reach adequate levels of gender balance as decision-making power remains in the hands of men, and the GPEI is largely led by men. Key governance, advisory groups and oversight bodies, such as the TAG, the Strategy Committee and the POB, are mainly composed of men. Staff in GPEI organizations are mostly men, especially in higher grade levels and senior posts.39 For example, of all polio personnel working at WHO Afghanistan, 8% are currently women, and at UNICEF Afghanistan, 26% of all polio-hired staff are women.40 I I GENDER EQUALITY STRATEGY I 2019-2023 20While fundamentally a right, parity is necessary to the GPEI's efficiency, impact and credibility. Many GPEI partners already have specific gender equality policies related to recruitment and human resources. Where currently missing, GPEI organizations need to adopt specific affirmative measures to achieve gender equality among staff and governing/advisory bodies, and to identify gender-related barriers related to recruitment, hiring, retention and advancement. The human resource strategies of each GPEI partner must include specific strategies, targets and actions to increase the pace towards gender parity in staffing. The focus will also be on furthering geographic diversity, particularly from under-represented groups. Without specific and targeted measures to recruit and retain more women, gender parity will remain elusive. To increase the number of female FLWs and other polio staff in countries where women's participation remains low (especially in Afghanistan), the GPEI will ensure that measures are put in place to enable more women to be recruited, retained and trained as polio workers and supervisors, while supporting the development of a safe, respectful and inclusive work environment. While the recruitment of female FLWs poses challenges, for example in the more conservative and rural areas of Afghanistan, efforts must be made to reduce barriers to women's full participation in areas where they are able to work outside the household. For example, the GPEI must ensure gender parity in polio FLW and supervisor selection committees to ensure it reaches its set target of at least 50% female FLWs in urban areas. The GPEI will: introduce quotas and commit to reaching gender parity (50-50%) in TAGs and panels, and governance and oversight bodies by the end of 2020; where currently missing, include specific strategies, targets and actions in each GPEI organization's human resource strategies to increase the pace towards gender parity in staffing; at a senior leadership level, commit to recruiting and promoting more women to address the current gender imbalance, especially in senior-level posts across the organizations; ensure that policies and training for the prevention of harassment and abuse of authority, conflict resolution and protection against retaliation are in place and implemented in each GPEI organization; provide training to senior management and human resource units on unconscious bias, and review language in job descriptions to ensure it is gender- neutral; foster gender-responsive workplaces, supporting all staff to take advantage of family-friendly policies, such as maternity and paternity leave and flexible work arrangements; ensure each entity has a breastfeeding policy in place, including designated nursing zones with appropriate facilities; and put in place concrete measures to increase women's participation as FLWs in areas where stark gender imbalance currently exists, while ensuring their security and safety, and: \u2014ensure that at least one third of polio worker selection committee members are women; \u2014adopt and enforce a quota of 30% women of all newly recruited FLWs, including vaccinators and social mobilizers, where possible; and \u2014invest in equal training opportunities for women and men, addressing the specific challenges and barriers faced by women. Capacity for gender mainstreaming To achieve adequate and systematic levels of gender responsiveness in GPEI programming, strengthening the capacity and institutional support of GPEI staff to apply gender analysis skills and gender-responsive actions in their planning, programme and technical work is important. In the 2018 GPEI gender survey completed by 634 staff members, 66% stated never having received any training related to gender. The 34% who had received training indicated they had completed it mainly as online courses. Importantly, when GPEI staff were asked why they did not integrate gender issues into their work, the main reasons given were the need for technical support and training on gender issues (see Figs 7 and 8).

A dedicated full-time staff member (at least at the P4 level) will act as the main technical focal point for gender mainstreaming within the GPEI. Additionally, dedicated gender focal points, with specific terms of reference, will be appointed within each GPEI organization, at different levels, including at headquarters and in regional offices and field/ country offices. Promoting gender equality and the empowerment of women, however, is everyone's responsibility in the GPEI and should not be viewed as solely the duty of the gender focal points; their role is to provide coordination and technical support. The appointed gender focal points will form a GPEI Gender Network, requiring a clear rationale for their selection, including seniority, dedicated time, resources and clear, measurable, expected deliverables and responsibilities included within their work plans and performance appraisals. Gender balance on gender focal point teams should be ensured. In addition to ensuring that specific staff are appointed to deliver on gender results within the various GPEI organizations, emphasis will be put on building the capacity of polio staff on gender mainstreaming and gender analysis. The GPEI will: ensure that all staff working for the GPEI complete mandatory training in the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA) and sexual harassment, and that a mechanism is in place to monitor compliance with training completion; I I GENDER EQUALITY STRATEGY I 2019-2023 22 provide training, especially to gender focal points, and to staff members and national partners on gender analysis and gender-responsive programming; ensure that senior management enable staff participation in learning activities related to gender, health and polio, when relevant; systematically share new guidelines, tools and resources developed on gender and polio with all staff; disseminate, via senior management, a list of available online training on gender mainstreaming and gender analysis, encouraging all staff at various levels to complete at least one technical training session; produce and make available checklists to help staff responsible for gender integration develop proposals, reports, guidelines and strategies; make concerted efforts to ensure gender balance in training activities, especially at the field level, to ensure women's equal participation as well as the engagement of men; appoint gender focal points in each GPEI organization to provide coordination and technical support for gender analysis and integration through the GPEI Gender Network; facilitate collaboration with respective organizational gender focal points and units, ensuring that each organization has a specific gender focal point with clear terms of reference; and ensure that senior management include gender issues in their official speeches, as well as briefings and presentations to staff, and regularly circulate materials related to gender and polio with all staff, at all levels. Prevention of sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment Tackling sexual exploitation and abuse41 against the people the GPEI serves and sexual harassment42 in 41 Sexual exploitation is \"any actual or attempted abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential power, or trust, for sexual purposes, including, but not limited to, threatening or profiting monetarily, socially or politically from the sexual exploitation of another\" Sexual abuse is \"the actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by force or under unequal or coercive conditions\" \"Sexual exploitation and abuse also includes sexual relations with a child [a human being under the age of 18 years], in any context \" Sexual exploitation and abuse prevention and response: Policy and procedures Geneva: World Health Organization; 2017 (http://www whoint/about/ethics/sexual-exploitation_abuse-prevention_response_policy pdf, accessed 17 May 2019) 42 Sexual harassment is \"any unwelcome, unsolicited and unreciprocated, sexual advance, request for sexual favour, verbal or physical conduct or gesture of a sexual nature, or any other behaviour of a sexual nature (including pornography, sexually-coloured remarks) that has or that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to offend, humiliate or intimidate another person\" Code of ethics and professional conduct Geneva: World Health Organization; 2017 (http://www whoint/about/ethics/code_of_ethics_full_versionpdf, accessed 17 May 2019) 43 Global Polio Eradication Initiative POB statement on sexual misconduct; 2018 (http://polioeradicationorg/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/polio-oversight- board-statement-on-sexual-misconduct-20180426pdf, accessed 17 May 2019)the workplace is a top priority for all GPEI partners.43 All staff should work and behave in a way that respects and fosters the rights of the people they serve, and contributes to a work environment free from disrespect, discrimination, abuse of authority and harassment. The GPEI is committed to providing a trusted, respectful and inclusive environment where the people served through polio eradication efforts, as well as those who work for the GPEI organizations, feel safe, equipped and empowered to speak up for themselves and others, and to take appropriate action to end sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA), as well as sexual harassment. The GPEI will ensure that each organization has clear guidelines on reporting, protection and recourse mechanisms for staff and collaborators, and addresses any acts of sexual harassment or abuse. The GPEI commits to enforcing a strict zero tolerance policy to all forms of SEA, as well as harassment, sexual harassment and gender-based discrimination. Importantly, it is critical for the GPEI to ensure that all beneficiaries as well as staff and contractors, including FLWs in countries where polio vaccination campaigns are conducted, are protected from all forms of SEA and harassment and are guaranteed a safe working environment. The GPEI will: publicize and disseminate the relevant policies on PSEA and sexual harassment to all staff, at all levels, in all GPEI organizations, including at headquarters and regional and field offices; ensure that all GPEI staff are aware of the existing confidential and safe reporting mechanism, along with a confidential and survivor-centred investigation process, for SEA and harassment within their organization through in-person trainings and briefings; assess staff knowledge of and trust levels in existing mechanisms for reporting different forms of harassment, and adjust the mechanisms and/ STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK I I 23or enhance direct communication about the mechanisms accordingly; make training related to PSEA and sexual harassment available and accessible, and ensure that all staff have completed at least the mandatory training sessions; brief all new GPEI staff and managers on PSEA and sexual harassment prevention and response during induction/orientation sessions, reiterating the zero tolerance approach; make no offers of employment before an applicant's background check has been completed, and ensure that any contractual engagement is terminated when an employee is proven to be involved in SEA; put in place specific field-level mechanisms to guarantee the safety of beneficiaries and a safe work environment for all staff and contractors, including FLWs, and enforce the GPEI's zero tolerance policy to SEA and harassment; ensure that senior management consistently and strongly enforce the principle of zero tolerance to all forms of sexual harassment and abuse in public statements and official communications with staff and contractors; and ensure anyone in a supervisory position is aware of existing policies, expectations and obligations regarding procedures for handling reported SEA and harassment cases. Senior leadership commitment and cultural change The senior leadership's support and commitment to gender integration are key to achieving and sustaining organizational cultures upholding gender mainstreaming and gender equality at all levels of the organization. The GPEI will promote a gender- responsive organizational culture by continuously raising awareness and strengthening the environment for learning. The GPEI leadership will affirm their commitment to integrating gender considerations across the agencies as well as promoting their adoption at the country programme, regional and headquarter levels. The GPEI will: assign formal oversight responsibility and accountability for the implementation of this Gender Equality Strategy to the Chair of the GPEI Strategy Committee and the POB; ensure senior management support their staff, specifically their gender focal points, in gender mainstreaming, including through making training opportunities available; ensure senior management include references to gender and women's empowerment in public speeches and encourage all staff to do the same in their technical work; add gender mainstreaming and gender equality criteria in the performance evaluation systems of all senior managers; incorporate gender into any new polio strategies, guidelines and action plans under development; provide the necessary financial resources for gender mainstreaming to ensure adequate budgets for gender expertise and capacity-building, as well as for the sustained and consistent implementation of gender equality programming (including research and analysis); systematically document and share knowledge internally and publicly on gender equality and women's empowerment and on the tools and good practices needed to achieve them; and ensure senior management enforce a strict zero tolerance policy to sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment, regularly following up on staff completion of mandatory training sessions and disseminating information to staff about existing policies and confidential reporting mechanisms.
