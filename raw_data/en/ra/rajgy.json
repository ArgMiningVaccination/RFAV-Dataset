We definitely don't want to add to our growing toxic burden! There are great options for natural household products, both DIY and purchased. In my opinion and experience, these are the best non toxic cleaning products. The best non toxic cleaning products: Why it matters Our bodies do have detoxification systems, but the more time goes on, the more toxic the world seems to get.

Get my full disclosure [here](https://bumblebeeapothecary.com/about/policies/). Homemade cleaning products Often, the best green cleaning products are ones you make yourself! All you really need is some baking soda, vinegar, and a little lemon essential oil to clean pretty much anything. If you also have some dish soap and rubbing alcohol, you can make all the cleaning products you'll need, right at home. Here are my favorite homemade cleaning products: - All purpose surface/disinfectant spray - In a [16 oz. glass spray bottle](https://amzn.to/32z8m7T), put 24 drops of [tea tree](https://www.gopjn.com/t/Qz9LREZIP0NLR0RKQz9LREZI?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.planttherapy.com%2Forganic-tea-tree-oil-wood-medicinal-scent-plant-therapy%3Fv%3D394)and 24 drops of [lemon essential oil](https://www.pntra.com/t/Qz9LREZIP0NLR0RKQz9LREZI?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.planttherapy.com%2Forganic-lemon-essential-oil-zesty-citrus-scent-plant-therapy%3Fv%3D379), a drop of dish soap, and fill the bottle the rest of the way with water or [white vinegar](https://amzn.to/2PlPAva). Shake to combine and before each use. - Glass cleaner - In a 16 oz. glass spray bottle, put 1/4 cup white vinegar, 1/4 cup [rubbing alcohol](https://amzn.to/2PnxOrs), and 24 drops [peppermint essential oil](https://www.gopjn.com/t/Qz9LREZIP0NLR0RKQz9LREZI?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.planttherapy.com%2Forganic-peppermint-oil-sweet-grassy-minty-scent-plant-therapy%3Fv%3D293). Fill the bottle the rest of the way with water. Shake to combine and before each use. - Grout, tile, and tub cleaner - Combine 1/2 cup [baking soda](https://amzn.to/2w5U3uY)with 12 drops of lemon essential oil. Use a scouring pad and a little water to scrub away. - Toilet bowl cleaner - Sprinkle some baking soda and a few drops of lemon essential oil inside the toilet bowl. If you have the surface spray above made with vinegar, spray this right into the bowl on the baking soda. The fizzing action will help clean. Scrub with a toilet brush, and then flush. To make it even faster and easier, you can also make some of these [toilet bombs](https://bumblebeeapothecary.com/toilet-bombs-easy-diy-toilet-cleaner/)! The best non toxic cleaning essentials you can buy Sometimes, DIY isn't an option. Thankfully, there are getting to be some great options for buying non toxic cleaning products. I'm going to share my favorite options based on products I've used and really like. Best natural cleaning products for bathroom Best natural all purpose cleaner: [Concentrates from Grove Collaborative](https://grove.pxf.io/dW5Gq) This is great, economical option. Grove Collaborative offers different cleaning concentrates that are really easy to use. You just squeeze the contents of the little tube into a glass spray bottle, and fill the bottle the rest of the way with water. That's it! You're ready to clean. If you're interested in trying Grove Collaborative, they are offering this cleaning tote, a 16 oz. glass spray bottle with silicone sleeve, three different cleaning concentrate tubes, and two walnut scrubbers, all for free for new subscribers.

Natural toilet bowl cleaner: [Seventh Generation toilet bowl cleaner](https://amzn.to/3a82Awx) [I've used this one a lot](https://amzn.to/3a82Awx), and it works great. There is no blue dye and weird scents, just effective, natural cleaning power. The best non toxic glass cleaner: [Method ](https://amzn.to/2urvmJ8) This one gives a nice, streak free shine to glass and any other hard surface you need to clean. Non toxic shower cleaner: [Seventh generation tub and tile cleaner](https://amzn.to/381OSJQ) [I was really impressed by how well this one works](https://amzn.to/381OSJQ). Regular tub, tile, and shower cleaners have such strong fragrances, I can hardly bare to use them! This one isn't like that, and it works great. The best non toxic kitchen cleaning essentials The best natural degreaser: [Method heavy duty degreaser ](https://amzn.to/2PlbI92) [This non toxic kitchen cleaner](https://amzn.to/2PlbI92) works like a charm to clean the top of the stove, and anywhere else in the kitchen that gets really nasty and dirty. It cuts right through grease and grime, leaving everything shiny and clean. Dishwasher detergent: [Azure Clean](https://www.azurestandard.com/shop/product/household-family/kitchen/dishwashing/dishwasher-detergent/powder/whishin-dishwasher-powder/21088?package=NF1675&a_aid=bH7Rv4Dgy2) This is another one that can be really toxic when it comes to conventional products. It's also another one where I've tried so many natural ones that don't work. My favorite has been [this powdered dishwasher detergent from Azure Standard](https://www.azurestandard.com/shop/product/household-family/kitchen/dishwashing/dishwasher-detergent/powder/whishin-dishwasher-powder/21088?package=NF1675&a_aid=bH7Rv4Dgy2). It is perfectly natural and works really well. Dish soap: [Azure Clean](https://www.azurestandard.com/shop/product/household-family/kitchen/dishwashing/dish-soap/smiley-sudz-dish-soap-citrus/26878?package=NF1621&a_aid=bH7Rv4Dgy2) [This is my favorite all natural dish soap](https://www.azurestandard.com/shop/product/household-family/kitchen/dishwashing/dish-soap/smiley-sudz-dish-soap-citrus/26878?package=NF1621&a_aid=bH7Rv4Dgy2) as well. It doesn't contain any dyes or fragrances, and has powerful grease cutting power. I like to add some lemon essential oil for enhanced cleaning effectiveness, antibacterial properties, and a nice scent. The best natural floor cleaner [Shark steam mop](https://amzn.to/2SYfk2V) I have been using [this Shark steam mop](https://amzn.to/2SYfk2V) for years now, and I really love it. It is so easy to use, and I love that it cleans so well with just steam! I find myself cleaning my floors more often with this mop, because it's so much easier than any other mop I've tried. For a nice scent, I sometimes add a few drops of essential oils to the bottom of the pad. Natural laundry products The best non toxic laundry detergent: [Boulder Clean](https://amzn.to/2Pog4MF) I have tried so many different natural laundry detergents, and this one really works. It works better than any other detergent I've tried. We have pretty hard water here in Colorado, so I add a dash of [Borax](https://amzn.to/32nhBb3) to soften the water, which helps the detergent wash more effectively. For more on my all natural laundry routine, check out [this post on how to wash cloth diapers](https://bumblebeeapothecary.com/how-to-wash-cloth-diapers-my-natural-wash-routine-with-plant-based-detergent-in-hard-water/). [Wool dryer balls](https://amzn.to/37TLQaM) Instead of dryer sheets, I love using my [wool dryer balls](https://amzn.to/37TLQaM) whenever I run a load of laundry in the dryer. They help to naturally soften the fabric, reduce static, and decrease drying time. Sometimes I will add a few drops of essential oils to the dryer balls to make the clean laundry smell even nicer. How to switch to non toxic cleaning products It's easier than you might think! With all of the options I've listed, you an either make or buy any cleaning product you need, without nasty toxins. Whenever you need a cleaning product, either make it yourself instead, or look for one of the natural products I've tried and really like. I think you'll be surprised at how well they work! I also have more essential oil spray recipes, like [air freshener and linen spray, in this post here](https://bumblebeeapothecary.com/essential-oil-spray-recipes/), along with a [cloth baby wipes solution recipe here](https://bumblebeeapothecary.com/cloth-baby-wipes-solution/). I also have a recipe for an [essential oil stain remover](https://bumblebeeapothecary.com/essential-oil-stain-remover/) that uses lemon essential oil to remove laundry stains. Having pure, healthy water is also very important. [This is my Berkey water filter review](https://bumblebeeapothecary.com/berkey-water-filter-review/) for the water filter system we use in our home.
