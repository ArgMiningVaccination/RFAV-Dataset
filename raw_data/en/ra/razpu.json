All immunizers must read and understand the [Annual Influenza Policy](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/publication/annual-influenza-policy-2018-2019). Immunizers are required to complete the [on-line education module](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/information/health-and-wellness/influenza-and-immunization-learning-module-nurses) prior to every influenza season. How can I order influenza vaccines? Immunizers in physician offices/clinics, hospitals, and long term/community care homes can order influenza vaccine from the Provincial Pharmacy by completing the [online order form](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/service/influenza-vaccine-orders). Pharmacies will continue to receive vaccine through pharmacy distribution sites. What are my responsibilities as an Immunizer? Immunizers are required to adhere to the [Annual Influenza Policy](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/publication/annual-influenza-policy-2018-2019) and to record and report all vaccines administered to the Chief Public Health Office under the [Immunization Regulations](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/sites/default/files/legislation/p30-1-3-public_health_act_immunization_regulations.pdf) of the Public Health Act R.S.P.E.I. 1988, Cap. P-30.1. What Infection Prevention and Control procedures are required this year when immunizing clients? Gloves are not required unless administering intranasal vaccine due to the risk of contact with mucous membranes and bodily fluids. How do I report vaccine administrations? Immunizers are encouraged to electronically report vaccine administrations. If you already enter client information into an electronic health system database (such as CIS, ICS, ISM, DIS, PeopleSoft), then you are already fulfilling your reporting requirements under the [Immunization Regulations](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/sites/default/files/legislation/p30-1-3-public_health_act_immunization_regulations.pdf). Those who are unable to report through an electronic health system database complete the [Immunization Reporting Form](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/sites/default/files/forms/immunization_report_email_-_add_name_of_office-facility-site_2020.xls) and submit via fax, mail, or email. If you have any questions about your reporting requirements, please contact the Chief Public Health Office at (902) 368-4996. What does the Chief Public Health Office do with the vaccine reports? The Chief Public Health Office maintains an electronic Immunization Registry that is accessible to Immunizers to view a patient's vaccine history. Immunizers must have access to the [Immunization Registry](http://apps.health.pe.ca/immunization/login) by contacting the Chief Public Health Office at (902) 368-4996. What do I do with leftover vaccines at the end of the season? Immunizers are responsible for returning any unused vaccines to the Provincial Pharmacy. Unused and expired vaccines are returned at the end of the season to the manufacturer for a rebate. Please ensure that your name and location is clearly identified on any returned vaccines. What do I do if there is an adverse event following immunization (AEFI)? All immunizers must monitor the health and safety of the individuals to whom influenza vaccine is administered; Immunizers shall have in place protocols for management of anaphylaxis and influenza vaccine must only be administered in settings where these protocols are in place. All unexpected adverse events following administration of influenza vaccine must be reported to the CPHO within 24 hours as soon as observed or reported using the [Adverse Event "}
