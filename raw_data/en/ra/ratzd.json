On This Page About Acupuncture Acupuncture is an ancient form of Chinese medicine that is based on the concept that the body has specific channels (meridians) through which energy (qi) flows. If the qi is deficient or excessive, or is not flowing freely, this can lead to disease. When acupuncture needles are placed in specific points on the skin, energy is redirected to prompt a healing response.
