Just the millions of YouTube videos alone prove that pets are silly, heart warming, curious and at times completely unpredictable. How is that not better for everyone's health? But there is more, the American Heart Association says that pet owners have reduced heart disease contributors and greater longevity. If pets are good for our health, then it's only right that we give them the same level of care we expect for ourselves. In this webinar from our partners at WholisticMatters, [veterinarian Patrick Mahaney, VMD, CVA, CVJ](https://www.patrickmahaney.com/about-us/staff/veterinarians/dr-patrick-mahaney), shares his practice of combining Western veterinary medicine with acupuncture and traditional Chinese veterinary medicine. He believes in a wholistic approach and emphasizes the importance of a whole food approach to nutrition. That sounds like good advice for humans and pets.
