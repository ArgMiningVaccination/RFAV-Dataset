The Program offers you the flexibility to receive care from the physicians of your choice. These benefits are provided under the Student Health Program and are described in this Summary Plan Description (SPD). Please read it carefully. This Summary Plan Description sets forth the benefits provided to pre and post doctoral fellows and students and for persons who are hired to w ork as House Staff. All Student Health Program members have the same plan of benefits. The medical benefits described in this SPD are administered by the Johns Hopkins Employer Health Programs (EHP). This SPD is effective for expenses incurred on and after July 1, 2020. For expenses incurred before that date, please refer to the July 1 2018 version of this SPD. IMPORTANT NOTE - Federal law requires that you also be provided with a \"Summary of Benefits and Coverage\" that briefly summarizes the benefit s provided by your Student Health Program in a limited number of pages. Your entitlement to benefits is determined only by this Summary Plan Description and not by the Summary of Benefits and Coverage. For information about your benefits, you should refe r to this Summary Plan Description and should not rely on the Summary of Benefits and Coverage. GENERAL INFORMATION 2 Who is Eligible Any individual holding pre - or postdoctoral student status (including Leave of Absence status and persons hired to work as House Staff) in the following schools: JHU School of Medicine Bloomberg School of Public Health JHU School of Nursing JHH Schools of Medical Imaging Any individual holding postdoctoral student status (including Leave of Absence status) in any other JHU school. Eligible dependents may also be covered under the Student Health Program. Eligible dependents are: Your legal spouse; Your domestic partner, as defined by the Johns Hopkins University, who is listed on your affidavit of domestic partnership; Your or your spouse/domestic partner's children, until they turn age 26. Your or your spouse/domestic partner's physically or mentally disabled dependent child of any age provided the physical or mental disability began prior to age 26. To be considered disabled, a c hild must be entitled to Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits on account of disability. However, if the child has not applied for SSI, you can instead demonstrate to the Plan Administrator's satisfaction that the child meets the SSI disability crit eria for adults -- the inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity as a result of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment(s) which can be expected to result in death, or has already lasted, or can be expected to last, for a con tinuous period of not less than 12 months. Children whom you may enroll must be your natural children, stepchildren, and foster children, children legally adopted or placed for adoption, and any children for whom you are the legal guardian. You may not c over a child for whom you only have legal custody. A dependent in active military service is not eligible for coverage. GENERAL INFORMATION 3 If your spouse is also eligible for enrollment in the Student Health Program, he or she may choose to be covered as a participant rath er than as a dependent, but not as both. Please note that your eligible children may only be covered by one parent's plan. If you have any questions about coverage, please call the benefits representative for your School at the following numbers: JHU School of Medicine - Registrar's Office at 410 -614-3301. Bloomberg School of Public Health - Student Accounts Office at 410 -955-5725. JHH Schools of Medical Imaging - 410-528-8208. JHU School of Nursing - 410-955-7547. JHU Berman Institute for Bioethics - Finance and Administration at 410 -614-5222 JHU Sheridan Libraries - Human Resources at 410 -516-8326 JHU Krieger School of Arts and Sciences - Human Resources at 410 -516-6808 JHU Whiting School of Engineering - Human Resources at 410 -516-6808 JHU School of Education - Human Resources at 410 -516-4475 Qualified Medical Child Support Order (QMCSO) Your child or children will automatically be enrolled in the Student Health Program if called for by a Qualified Medical Child Support Order or a National Medical S upport Notice (QMCSO). A QMCSO is a court or agency order setting responsibility for health care expenses for non -custodial children. If you are served with a QMCSO, please send the order to the benefits representative for your School by contacting them at the number shown above as soon as possible. When Coverage Begins Students are eligible to participate in the Student Health Program upon registration and/or the effective date of appointment with no waiting period. If you are hired to work as House S taff or as an ACGME accredited fellow, you can start coverage as of your first day of orientation. In either case, there is no coverage until you submit a properly completed application. Medical coverage for your dependents will begin at the same time as your own if you have properly enrolled them. If you have a new baby, adopt a child, or have a child placed with you for adoption, and you enroll this dependent within 30 days, your child's coverage becomes effective on the date of the birth or adoption. If you marry and you enroll your spouse within 30 days after your marriage, your spouse's coverage becomes effective on the date of marriage. GENERAL INFORMATION 4 Changing Your Coverage During the annual enrollment period, you may change your Student Health Program coverage. Outside of the annual enrollment period, you may change coverage only if you have a qualifying family status change or a special enrollment situation (see below unde r Special Enrollment Rights ). Appropriate documentation of the life event may be required. Examples of IRS -qualified changes in family status include: Marriage, legal separation, annulment, or divorce; Birth, death, or adoption of a dependent; Placement for adoption of a dependent; Your dependent becomes eligible or is no longer eligible for coverage under the Student Health Program; You are required to cover your child due to a QMCSO; You or your dependent gain or lose eligibility for Medicare or Medica id (you may change the current election for the affected person only); and Any other event that the Plan Administrator determines to qualify as a family status change under the Internal Revenue Code. Any student, spouse or dependent child whose coverage u nder any other group health plan ends may possibly be permitted to enroll in coverage under the Program within 30 days of the date of the loss of other coverage as explained below under Special Enrollment Rights . Please contact the benefits representative for your School (see page 3) about your situation to see if coverage is available. Any change in your benefit enrollment must correspond directly to the change in family status. You must submit a new enrollment form or a change of information form withi n 30 days after the change. If your completed form is received on time, coverage will be effective on the date of the change in family status. If you delay past 30 days, you must wait until the next open enrollment before coverage can become effective. Please keep your School informed of any changes in family status. GENERAL INFORMATION 5 Special Enrollment Rights for Medical Coverage Losing other coverage If you did not enroll in the Student Health Program because you had coverage through another source (such as a spouse's employer or COBRA), and you subsequently lose that coverage, you may enroll for medical coverage under the Student Health Program. You must request this special enrollment by submitting a properly completed enrollment form within 30 days of losin g your other coverage. If your completed form is received on time, coverage will be effective on the date you lost the other coverage, with no waiting period. Special enrollment does not apply if you lost coverage under the other plan because you did not make required contributions or if you lost coverage for cause (such as making a fraudulent claim). New Children Children whom you acquire through birth, adoption, or placement for adoption, may be granted special enrollment, as long as you request cover age by submitting a properly completed enrollment form within 30 days following the date you acquired the child. Contact the benefits representative for your School (see page 3) to request special enrollment. If enrolled on time, coverage will become eff ective on the date of the birth, adoption, or placement for adoption. If you do not have coverage for yourself, your spouse or any of your other children, you must also enroll yourself, and you may also enroll your spouse or any of your other children, wh en you enroll your new child. Marriage If you get married, your new spouse may be granted special enrollment , as long as you request coverage by submitting a properly completed enrollment form within 30 days following the date of marriage. If enrolled o n time, coverage will become effective on the date of marriage. If you do not have EHP coverage for yourself or any of your children, you must also enroll yourself, and you may also enroll any of your children when you enroll your new spouse. Medicaid an d Children's Health Insurance Program If you or your child have health insurance coverage under Medicaid or a Children's Health Insurance Program (\"CHIP\") and you or your child lose eligibility for that coverage, you may enroll for medical coverage under the Student Health Program. You must request this special enrollment by submitting a properly completed enrollment form within 60 days of losing your Medicaid or CHIP coverage. If enrolled on time, coverage will become effective on the first day of the m onth after you submit your GENERAL INFORMATION 6 enrollment form. If you or your child become eligible to receive assistance from Medicaid or CHIP to pay your required contributions for coverage under the Student Health Program, you may enroll for Student Health Program covera ge. You must request this special enrollment by submitting a properly completed enrollment form within 60 days of becoming eligible for the assistance. If enrolled on time, coverage under the Student Health Program will become effective on the first day of the month following the date you submit your enrollment form. Contact the benefits representative for your School (see page 3) to request any of the above special enrollments. YOUR STUDENT HEALTH PROGRAM 7 Your Student Health Program The Student Health Program benefits described in this SPD are administered by Johns Hopkins Employer Health Programs. The Student Health Program allows you to go to any provider in the Program's networks, or you may go to a provid er that is not in the networks. The choice is yours, but the Program often pays higher benefits if you go to a network provider. The Student Health Program offers two networks: Johns Hopkins EHP Network. The Program's primary network of providers throu ghout Maryland. EHP Preferred Providers. A preferred subset of the providers in the Johns Hopkins EHP Network. MultiPlan PHCS Network. A network of providers for services received outside the State of Maryland. For services received inside the State of Maryland, MultiPlan PHCS Network providers are only considered to be network providers if they also participate in the Johns Hopkins EHP Network. Any reference to EHP Network providers in this SPD also means MultiPlan PHCS Network providers, but only for services received outside the State of Maryland. You should ask your provider if they are in the EHP Network before you receive services in Maryland, or if they are in the MultiPlan PHCS Network before you receive services outside of Maryland. For a comp lete listing of EHP Network providers, please see the provider directory available at www.ehp.org , or call 410 -424-4450 or 800 -261-2393. For a complete listing of MultiPlan PHCS Network providers, please see the provider directory available at www.multiplan.com or call 866 -980- 7427. The University Health Services Health Center (UHSHC) is also a covered provider for those persons who pay t he student health fee, and their adult dependents. The UHSHC does not provide pediatric care. Options for Coverage There are two different Options for how you obtain medical care. The level of coverage and the deductible you must meet depend on which Option you use: Option 1 - a higher level of benefits is provided for treatment by EHP Network providers. Option 2 - a lower level of benefits is provided for treatment by Out -of-Network providers. YOUR STUDENT HEALTH PROGRAM 8 The various coverage levels and deductibles for each Option are shown on the Medical Benefits At-A-Glance chart later in this SPD. As you will see on the chart, sometimes the 100% coverage only applies if you access care through Option 1. Other times, the 100% coverage applies for care accessed through O ption 2 as well. However, the Program only covers charges up to the Allowed Benefit (\"AB\") (explained below under Payment Terms You Should Know ). Providers under Option 1 will never charge more than the Allowed Benefit, but Out -of-Network providers under Option 2 can charge more than the Allowed Benefit, and you must pay the difference. You are not required by the Student Health Program to get a referral in order to access care that is covered by either Option. However, many specialists will not see you unless you have been referred by a primary care physician. Payment Terms You Should Know The following terms are used throughout this SPD. Allowed Benefit (AB): For any service or supply, the lesser of (1) the provider's actual charge or (2) the amo unt that would be allowed by Medicare, increased by a percentage determined by Johns Hopkins Employer Health Programs, not to exceed 150% of the amount that would be allowed by Medicare. If Medicare does not provide an allowance for a service or supply, t hen Allowed Benefit means the prevailing, reasonable fee paid to similar providers for the same service or supply in the same geographic area, as determined by Johns Hopkins Employer Health Programs. EHP Network providers (Option 1) will not charge more t han the Allowed Benefit, but Out -of-Network providers (Option 2) can charge more and you are responsible for charges above the Allowed Benefit. Coinsurance: Your percentage share of the charge for certain medical expenses. The Medical Benefits At -A-Glanc e chart later in this SPD lists the specific coinsurance amounts. Deductible: The amount you must pay each plan year (July 1 - June 30) before the Program begins to pay benefits for most services. Expenses incurred and applied to your deductible in April, May and June of a plan year are also carried over and applied to the next pl an year's deductible. Expenses incurred by two or more persons can meet the family deductible. However, no one person will be required to satisfy more than the per person deductible. If you transfer from one student status to a different status that is still eligible for coverage under the Program, and you do not have any lapse of coverage, any amounts you paid towards a year's deductible will still be counted and the deductible carryover feature will continue to apply. Please note that your coinsurance payments (i.e., your percentage or share of expenses) and any amounts over the Allowed Benefit do not apply toward the deductible. YOUR STUDENT HEALTH PROGRAM 9 If two or more family members receive injuries in the same accident, and as a result of those injuries incur covered expens es, only one deductible amount will be deducted from the total covered expenses incurred as a result of those injuries. If you acquire two or more children as a result of a multiple birth and if you incur covered expenses for those children as a result of premature birth, abnormal congenital condition, or sickness commencing or injury received not more than 30 days after their birth, only one deductible amount will be deducted from the total covered expenses incurred for those children as a result of the m ultiple birth. Facility charges and Professional fees: Some providers may separately bill for professional fees and facility charges. If so, you might receive two separate bills. The professional fee covers the services delivered to you by a physician or other healthcare practitioner. The facility charge covers the cost of maintaining the facility where the professional services are provided. Out-of-Pocket Maximum: Since you are responsible for a portion of the cost of certain of your medical expenses , the Program includes two plan year out -of-pocket maximums to protect you in the event of high medical bills. One out -of-pocket maximum applies to all expenses other than prescription drug copays, and a separate out -of-pocket maximum applies just to pres cription drug copays. Expenses other than prescription drug copays . After you have paid the plan year out -of-pocket maximum of $3,000 per person or $9,000 per family, the Program covers any additional expenses incurred in the same plan year at 100% of the Allowed Benefit. The out -of-pocket maximum applies on a per person basis, regardless of your level of coverage (individual, husband and wife, family, etc.). For example, if you have individual coverage, your maximum is $3,000. If you have family cov erage, your maximum and the separate maximum for each member of your family is still $3,000. Plus, once you have paid $9,000 during a plan year for all members of your family in total, then all members of your family have met the maximum. The out -of-pock et maximum includes the deductible and coinsurance but does not include prescription drug copays, charges above Program maximums, charges for services which are not covered, or charges above the Allowed Benefit. Prescription drug copays . There is a separ ate out -of-pocket maximum of $3,350 per person or $3,700 per family that applies just to prescription drug copays. The separate prescription drug copay out -of-pocket maximum applies using the same rules that apply to the out -of-pocket maximum for all othe r expenses, except that charges for prescription drugs that are obtained from a non-Network pharmacy do not apply to the out -of-pocket maximum. YOUR STUDENT HEALTH PROGRAM 10 Provider: A hospital, skilled nursing/rehabilitation facility, individual, organization, or agency licensed to provide professional services and acting within the scope of that license. Benefits will only be paid for covered services from providers who meet this definition. Benefits will not be paid for any services and related charges provided by a close relativ e of the patient (spouse, domestic partner, child, grandchild, brother, sister, brother -in-law, sister -in-law, parent or grandparent). The University Health Services Health Center (UHSHC ) is also a covered provider for those persons who pay the student health fee, and their adult dependents. The UHSHC does not provide pediatric care. Preauthorization Requirement - Utilization Management Certain services and supplies are not covered by the Program unless they are preauthorized by EHP Utilization Management. Your EHP Network provider will request preauthorization for you as needed. If you receive Out -of-Network care, you or your Out -of-Network provider must request preauthorization. Unless preauthorization is received, there is no coverage for the services and supplies in question. The services and supplies that currently require preauthorization by Utilization Management are set forth in the Medical Benefits At -A-Glance chart and under Covered Services and Supplies later in this SPD. Because medical treatments are constantly changing, Johns Hopkins Employer Health Programs can determine that preauthorization is required for additional services and supplies not shown in this SPD. EHP Network providers have access to an updated list of additional services and supplies that require preauthorization, and will request preauthorization as needed. Before you receive Out -of-Network care, you or your Out -of-Network provider mus t check with Johns Hopkins Employer Health Programs to see if the services or supplies involved require preauthorization, and if so must request preauthorization. Care Management Programs When faced with health challenges, you are not alone. Johns Hopki ns EHP has a care management team of nurses, social workers and community health workers available to help you better manage your health. These dedicated care managers are available to support you in coordinating medical care for both acute and chronic il lnesses. They will work closely with you and your other medical providers to ensure that you have access to appropriate services. Your care manager may also suggest alternative care options and coordinate with providers to improve standards for the medic al care you receive. Your care manager can also help you identify non -medical resources in the community. YOUR STUDENT HEALTH PROGRAM 11 Transition of Care -- if you are faced with an inpatient admission, care management will assist in making sure you have everything you need prior to and after discharge. Complex Care -- if you are faced with a serious medical event or a long -term health condition, care management can provide support by coordinating care, understanding and managing your medical event or condition, and facilitating nec essary services covered by your Student Health Program benefits. Preventive Care -- if you have a chronic health condition, care management can support you with understanding and managing your condition, getting connected to providers and community resour ces, and helping you maintain or reach your best level of health. Behavioral Health Care -- if you are living with a mental health condition such as depression, autism spectrum disorder, anxiety or addiction, care management can provide confidential care coordination. Maternal/Child Health Care -- supporting you through your pregnancy and delivering a healthy baby is everyone's goal. After delivery, care management provides tools to assist in caring for your child when they have additional needs through young adulthood. The right care at every stage of life can help you stay healthy, avoid or delay the onset of disease, or keep a condition you may already have from becoming worse. You and your covered family members may self -refer into these programs by going to https://www.ehp.org/plan -benefits/health -programs and resources/ , by contacting care management at caremanagement@jhhc.com, or by calling 800 -557-6916, Monday -Friday 8 a.m. - 5 p.m. Health and Wellness Programs Johns Hopkins EHP is committed to partnering with you to achieve optimal health.

COVERED SERVICES AND SUPPLIES 19 Covered Services and Supplies The Student Health Program provides benefits for the services and supplies listed in this section. Only services and supplies that are medically necessary are covered. A medically necessary service or supply is one that the Plan Administrator determines: Diagnoses, prevents or treats a covered medical condition; Is appropriate for the symptoms, diagnosis or treatment of the covered medical condition; Is supplied or performed in accordance with current standards of medical practice within the United States of America; Is not primarily for the convenience of the covered person, facility or provider; Is the most appropriate supply or level of service that can safely be provided; and Is recommended or approved by the attending professional provider. In the case of an inpatient admission, medically necessary also means treatment that could not adequately be provided on an outpatient basis. A treatment is not medically necessary if it violates the Employer Health Programs fraud, waste and abuse policy. T he Plan Administrator may rely on Employer Health Programs policies to determine whether a treatment is medically necessary. Benefit limits, coinsurance and copay amounts are shown in the Medical Benefits At -A-Glance chart. The Student Health Program co vers the services and supplies described below, when medically necessary and subject to any conditions or limitations described elsewhere in this SPD: Ambulance Services The Student Health Program covers both air and ground ambulance transportation serv ices when one of the following criteria are met: Because of an emergency medical situation (defined below under Emergency Services ), it is medically necessary to transport you to the hospital, It is medically necessary to transport you from a hospital as an inpatient to another hospital, because the first hospital lacks the equipment or expertise necessary to care for you, You are transported directly from a hospital to a skilled nursing/rehabilitation facility, or As preauthorized by Utilization Managemen t based on special medical circumstances Air ambulance is covered only if it is medically necessary to be transported by air and not by ground. It is not medically necessary to be transported by air if a facility that can provide the necessary medical COVERED SERVICES AND SUPPLIES 20 care can be safely accessed by ground transportation. Except for an emergency medical situation, air ambulance transportation must be preauthorized by Utilization Management or it will not be covered. In no event will the Program pay more than the Allowe d Benefit for air or ground ambulance transportation. Emergency Care In an emergency medical situation , you should go to the nearest medical facility for immediate care. An emergency medical situation means a medical condition that manifests itself by a cute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) so that a prudent layperson, who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine, could reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical attention to : Place the health of the patient (in cluding the unborn child of a pregnant woman) in serious jeopardy, Result in serious impairment to bodily functions, or Result in serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part The following visits to an emergency room will be automatically treated as an \"emergency medical situation\", regardless of whether the visit satisfies the criteria set forth above: visits for children under age two visits where the claim form indicates a \"sudden and serious\" diagnosis, or visits where Utilization Management is not ified by the patient's physician that the patient was referred to the hospital emergency room You do not need to obtain preauthorization from Utilization Management for treatment of an emergency medical situation. If you receive treatment in an emergency room for a condition that is not an emergency medical situation, the Program will not pay benefits visit and you are responsible for all charges. Emergency Room Treatment by an emergency room (hospital or freestanding) for an emergency medical situation is covered under the Option 1 In -Network benefit regardless of whether or not the emergency room participates in the EHP Network. Treatment of an emergency medical situation in a hospital emergency room is covered at 100% of the Allowed Benefit, after th e deductible. A $50 copay applies COVERED SERVICES AND SUPPLIES 21 to each visit to an emergency room (hospital or freestanding). The copay is waived if you are admitted to the hospital. Treatment of an emergency medical situation does not include admission to the hospital for inpatien t services. For any treatment other than treatment of an emergency medical situation, you must determine if the treatment is subject to the preauthorization requirements of Utilization Management. If preauthorization is required, you must initiate the pr eauthorization process, even if the treatment is for urgent care. Urgent Care Centers If your regular provider is unable to see you, and you believe you need prompt medical attention for a condition which is not serious enough to be an \"emergency medical situation\" as described above, you may go to an urgent care center. An urgent care cen ter is a facility (other than an emergency room) that is licensed to provide medical services for unexpected illnesses or injuries that require prompt medical attention, but are not life - or limb -threatening. Physician visits and diagnostic services and t reatment at an EHP Network urgent care center are covered at 100%, after the deductible. Treatment at an Out -of- Network urgent care center is covered at 80% of the Allowed Benefit, after the deductible. You are responsible for any charges over the Allowe d Benefit . Please Note: An \"urgent care center\" is a name used to describe a facility that treats medical conditions that are not serious enough to require going to an emergency room. A patient's condition does not have to meet the definition of \"emergency medical situation\" set forth above in order for the patient to go to an urgent care center.

COVERED SERVICES AND SUPPLIES 38 Mental health and substance use disorder treatment is subject to the same copay, coinsurance, deductibles, limits and other requirements that apply to medical treatment, based on whether you receive treatment under Option 1 (EHP Network providers) or Opti on 2 (Out -of-Network). Outpatient care includes psychotherapy and counseling for substance/alcohol abuse. Benefits are only provided when the services are received from independently credentialed mental health/substance use disorder providers that are ps ychiatrists, clinical psychologists, certified addiction counselors or licensed clinical social workers (ACSW, LCSW, MSW). Graduate Student Counselors are not covered providers and benefits are not provided for their services. Like any other medical trea tment, mental health and substance use disorder treatment is only covered if it is medically necessary (see the definition at the beginning of the Covered Services and Supplies section). Like any other medical treatment, any inpatient admission (including inpatient residential, \"partial hospitalization\" day treatment programs and intensive outpatient care) must be preauthorized . Outpatient mental health and substance use disorder treatment does not have to be preauthorized. However, if you have your trea tment preauthorized, you can be assured that your treatment will be considered medically necessary and therefore covered. Through the preauthorization process you can talk to mental health professionals who will help you determine the best course of treat ment for you. They will refer you to a provider (usually an EHP Network provider). If you wish, you may instead refer yourself to any provider in or out of the EHP Network. The choice is yours. However, if you refer yourself to a provider your treatmen t will only be covered if it is determined to be medically necessary. You can contact Utilization Management at 410 -424-4476 or 800 -261-2429. Outpatient mental health care: Provider fees for outpatient mental health care are paid at 90% if you access car e under Option 1, and at 90% of the Allowed Benefit if you access care under Option 2. Facility charges for outpatient mental health care are paid at 90% of the Allowed Benefit. Inpatient mental health care: Facility charges are paid at 100% of the Allow ed Benefit for the first 30 days of an admission. Thereafter, charges are paid at 80% of the Allowed Benefit. You pay the remaining 20%, plus any charges above the Allowed Benefit. Provider fees are paid at 80% of the Allowed Benefit. Outpatient substance use disorder care: Facility charges for outpatient substance use disorder care are paid at 90% of the Allowed Benefit. Provider fees are paid at 100% if you access care under Option 1, and at 80% of the Allowed Benefit if you access c are under Option 2.

Thereafter, charges are paid at 80% of the Allowed Benefit. You pay the remaining 20%, plus any ch arges above the Allowed Benefit. Provider fees will be paid at 80% of the Allowed Benefit.

The confidential number to call is 410 -424-4476 or 800 -261-2429. Failure to obtain preauthorization will result in denial of coverage . Prescription Drug Benefits The Program covers prescription drugs designated as such under federal law, as well as injectable insulin, diabetic supplies (needles and syringes when prescribed with insulin only), and other medicines and supplies designated by Johns Hopkins Employer Hea lth Programs. You can receive a supply of up to 30 days at a retail pharmacy, or a 90 -day supply for maintenance drugs. A cost saving 90-day supply is available through the Mail Order program for maintenance drugs. Participating pharmacy directories and mail order forms may be accessed on EHP's website at www.ehp.org . EHP Network Pharmacies You will receive the highest level of prescription drug benefits if you fill your prescription at a Johns Hopkins EHP Network pha rmacy. Your EHP provider search at www.ehp.org has a complete list of EHP Network pharmacies. An EHP Network pharmacy has an arrangement to provide prescription drugs to you at an agreed upon price. When you buy covere d drugs from an EHP Network pharmacy, present your Student Health Program identification card to the pharmacist. You must pay a copay as explained below. You are responsible for the full cost of prescription drugs that are not covered by the Program. If you purchase prescription drugs from a Non -Network pharmacy, you must pay the pharmacy for the purchase and submit for reimbursement from the Student Health Program. You will be reimbursed for the EHP Network pharmacy price for the covered prescription, less the applicable copay. To obtain reimbursement, you must complete the Prescription Reimbursement Standard Claim Form, and follow directions on the form for mailing. Contact Student Health Program Customer Service to get a Claim Form or if you have an y questions about how to submit a claim for reimbursement. Charges for prescription drugs purchased from a Non -Network pharmacy do not apply to the prescription drug out - of-pocket maximum. COVERED SERVICES AND SUPPLIES 40 Please note: As explained below, your physician may need to obtai n prior authorization before certain drugs may be dispensed. Copay You pay a $15 copay for each separate prescription or refill of up to a 30 -day supply of a generic drug. No copay applies for contraceptives that are required to be covered without cost -sharing under comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration. Normally, no copay only applies to generic contraceptives. However, if your provider determines that a brand name contraceptive is medically necessary, no copay will apply to that contraceptive. Otherwise, the copay for up to a 30 -day supply is $25 for brand name preferred drugs and $40 for brand name non -preferred drugs, regardless of whether a generic version is available. For maintenance drugs, you may obtain a 90 -day supply at a retail pharmacy for three times the normal monthly copay for that prescription. Or, you may use the Mail Order program, presently offered through CVS Caremark. Through this program, you can obtain a 90 -day supply of mainte nance drugs each time you order for only two times the normal monthly copay. Your copay through the Mail Order program is $30 for each separate prescription or refill of a generic drug. The Mail Order copay is $50 for brand name preferred drugs and $80 f or brand name non -preferred drugs. If you have any questions about the Mail Order program, call EHP. Prescribed oral contraceptives and contraceptive devices are covered, however non -prescribed contraceptives and devices are not covered. Removal of Norp lant is covered; however insertion of Norplant is not covered. Annual copays are subject to the Prescription Drug out -of-pocket maximum shown in the Medical Benefits -At-A-Glance chart earlier in this SPD. Prior Authorization, Quantity Limits and Step The rapy The Student Health Program has a Prior Authorization program, a Quantity Limits (Managed Drugs Limitation) program and a Step Therapy program for certain drugs. Some drugs require prior authorization before coverage is approved, to assure medical ne cessity, clinical appropriateness and/or cost effectiveness. Coverage of these drugs is subject to specific criteria approved by physicians and pharmacists on the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. Certain drugs have specific dispensing limitations for quantity and maximum dose. Other drugs have Step Therapy requirements, which means they are not covered until you have first tried other drugs to treat the condition. COVERED SERVICES AND SUPPLIES 41 You can find out if a drug is subject to Prior Authorization, Quantity Limits and Step Therapy by going to the EHP website at www.ehp.org . Go to \"Plan Benefits\", then then the Student Health Program's name, then \"Prior Authorization\" and follow the instructions. Call EHP customer service at 410-424-4450 if you need assistance. If your physician determines that use of a drug that requires Prior Authorization is necessary, your physician must complete a Pharmacy Prior Authorization Form (available on the EHP website at the link to Forms) and fa x it to EHP at the number shown on the Form. If your physician determines that dosage of a drug in a greater quantity than is allowed under the Quantity Limits program is needed, or that a drug subject to Step Therapy should be covered instead of other dr ugs to treat the condition, your physician can submit a request by also using the Pharmacy Prior Authorization Form. EHP will notify you and your physician of approval or denial of the request. If the request is denied, you may appeal the denial to the E HP Appeals Department in accordance with the appeal rules for pre -service claims set forth below in this SPD. Caremark Formulary Drugs CVS Caremark manages the Student Health Program's prescription drug benefit, and maintains the prescription drug Advanc ed Control Formulary, which can be accessed on the EHP website. The Formulary lists those prescription drugs that are regularly covered by the Student Health Program. If a drug is not listed on the Formulary, you must pay the full cost for the drug unles s Caremark issues a prior authorization for medical necessity for the drug. Caremark will only do so if your physician can demonstrate that it is medically necessary for you to take the non -Formulary drug instead of the other optional drugs that are liste d on the Formulary. To request prior authorization for medical necessity for a non -Formulary drug, your physician must complete the CVS Caremark electronic prior authorization process or call CVS Caremark. The link for the electronic process and the phon e number are available on the Johns Hopkins HealthCare provider website. If Caremark grants your request for prior authorization for a non -Formulary drug, you must pay the copay that applies to brand name non - preferred drugs. If Caremark denies your requ est for prior authorization for a non -Formulary drug, you can make a First Level Appeal to Caremark in accordance with the directions included on the denial letter. If Caremark denies your First Level Appeal, you may make a Final Appeal to the Plan Admini strator in accordance with the appeal rules for pre -service claims set forth below in this SPD (which will also be described in the First Level Appeal denial letter). What's Not Covered No prescription drug benefits will be paid for the following: Any amounts you are required to pay directly to the pharmacy for each prescription or refill COVERED SERVICES AND SUPPLIES 42 Any charge for administration of drugs or insulin Drugs that are excluded from coverage for a reason set forth later in this SPD under What's Not Covered by the Studen t Health Program Methadone Schedule V -exempt narcotics Hypodermic needles and syringes (other than for diabetic use and for self -administered injections) Drugs that are non -prescription, non -legend or over -the-counter (except for certain prescribed OTC drugs as explained below, or as required to be covered for preventive care) Drugs or devices not approved by the FDA for marketing and/or for the prescribed treatment of a specific diagnosis unless approved by Utilization Management.

Over -the-Counter Drugs Prescription drug benefits are nor mally not provided for drugs that are available \"over -the-counter\" (OTC). A drug is considered to be available OTC if it can be obtained without a prescription, regardless of whether or not your doctor gives you a prescription for it. However, prescripti on drug benefits are provided for the following generic OTC drugs, but only if your doctor prescribes these drugs and you show the pharmacist your prescription at time of purchase.

WHAT'S NOT COVERED 46 The Plan Administrator will make a determination on a case by case basi s, using the following principles as generally establishing that something is experimental: If the drug or device cannot be lawfully marketed without approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and approval for marketing has not been given at the tim e the drug or device is furnished; this principle does not apply to a medical device to the extent Medicare would cover the device in accordance with Medicare Policy Manual Chapter 14. If the drug, device, equipment, treatment or procedure, or the patient informed consent document utilized with the drug, device, equipment, treatment or procedure, was reviewed and approved by the treating facility's Institutional Review Board or other body serving a similar function, or if Federal law requires such review or approval. If Reliable Evidence shows that the drug, device, equipment, treatment or procedure is the subject of ongoing phase II clinical trials, is the subject of research, experimental study or the investigational arm of ongoing phase III clinical trial s, or is otherwise under study to determine its maximum tolerated dose, its toxicity, its safety, its efficacy or its efficacy as compared with a standard means of treatment or diagnosis. A treatment, procedure, equipment, device, drug or drug usage will generally not be considered experimental merely because it is the subject of a clinical trial, to the extent Medicare would cover it in accordance with a national coverage determination (or other binding pronouncement). If Reliable Evidence shows that the prevailing opinion among experts regarding the drug, device, equipment, treatment or procedure is that further studies or clinical trials are necessary to determine its maximum tolerated dose, its toxicity, its safety, its efficacy or its efficacy as compa red with a standard means of treatment or diagnosis. \"Reliable Evidence\" means only published reports and articles in the authoritative medical and scientific literature; the written protocols used by the treating facility or the protocol(s) of another facility studying substantially the same drug, device, equipment, treatment or procedure; or the written informed consent used by the treating facility or by another facility studying substantially the same drug, device, equipment, treatment or procedure; Notwithstanding the exclusion of coverage for experimental treatment, but only to the extent necessary to comply with Public Health Service Act Section 2709, coverage is not excluded for, nor are limits or additional conditions imposed on coverage of, rout ine patient costs for treatment furnished in connection with participation by a qualified individual in an approved clinical trial.

OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR BENEFITS 51 Other Information About Your Student Health Program Benefits Filing A Claim With Employer Health Programs You do not have to file a claim form with Employer Health Programs if you receive services from an EHP Network provider under the Student Health Program. EHP Network providers will file claims for you. You do need to file a claim with Employer Health Programs if you receive services from an Out -of- Network provider. (You also need to file a claim if you purchase prescription drugs from an Out -of- Network pharmacy, as explained under Prescription Drug Bene fits.) To submit your claim, complete a claim form, attach your itemized bills to it, and send it to the address shown on the form. Claims should be reported promptly, and no claims will be accepted after 18 months from the date services or supplies were provided. Itemized bills must include the following information: The date(s) that services or supplies were received A description and diagnosis of the services or supplies rendered The charge for each service or supply The name, address, and professi onal status of the provider, and The full name of the person who received the care Claim forms are available online at www.ehp.org . To avoid delay in handling your claim, answer all questions completely and accurately. Expenses cannot be processed without your signature in the appropriate areas of the form. More information about your claims and appeals rights is set forth below under Claims for Benefits in the Administrative Information section. Claims incurred outside the United States If you receive medical care outside the United States, you must submit a claim in accordance with the rules set forth above for services from an Out -of-Network provider. The itemized bill(s) that you attach should be in English for faster processing. Ask the provider for an English language bill. If the provider cannot provide an English language bill, you may submit a foreign language bill but processing of your claim will be delayed while the bill is translated. OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR BENEFITS 52 Be sure to i nclude proof that you paid the bill, such as a credit card receipt or other evidence of payment. If you have any questions about submitting a claim, contact an EHP Customer Service Representative at 888 -400-0091 or 410 -424-4485. What Happens When You Hav e Duplicate Coverage You and members of your family could be covered under more than one group health plan or health insurance coverage. These other plans may include health care insurance available through your spouse's or domestic partner's employer. You may also qualify for benefits from state no -fault automobile laws. The Student Health Program, like most plans, includes a Coordination of Benefits (COB) provision. The purpose of this provision is to limit the total amount you may receive from all m edical plans to no more than 100% of the covered charges. The plan that pays first is the Primary Plan. The Secondary Plan makes up the difference between the benefit paid (or deemed paid) by the Primary Plan and the maximum amount that would be paid un der the Secondary Plan if there were no Primary Plan. If the Student Health Program is the Secondary Plan, only covered expenses up to the Program's fee schedule may be covered. Any applicable copays, coinsurance or deductibles under the two plans stil l apply. The plan of the patient's employer or School is the Primary Plan. To determine benefits for covered dependent children, the plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the year is the Primary Plan for children. However, if the other heal th care plan does not include this \"birthday rule\" on children's coverage, or if both parents have the same birthday, the plan of the parent that has covered the dependent for a longer period of time is the Primary Plan and pays first. The other parent's plan will be Secondary. In cases where parents are divorced or legally separated, the Coordination of Benefits rules only apply when a child is actually covered under the separate plans of both parents. In that event, the plan of the parent with a court order or legal agreement setting responsibility for health care expenses is the Primary Plan, and the plan of the other parent is the Secondary Plan. If there is no such court order or legal agreement, the birthday rule applies. OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR BENEFITS 53 If you are married or have a domestic partner, the plan of your spouse/domestic partner is the Primary Plan for expenses incurred by your spouse/domestic partner and the Student Health Program is the Secondary Plan. The plan of your spouse/domestic partne r is the Secondary Plan for expenses incurred by you and the Student Health Program is the Primary Plan. If you have enrolled your spouse/domestic partner in the Student Health Program and your spouse/domestic partner loses coverage under their other pla n, the Student Health Program becomes primary for both of you and any covered dependent children. Please note that the Student Health Program is the Secondary Plan to any other plan covering a qualified beneficiary who has elected COBRA. The Student Hea lth Program is the Primary Plan if you are covered under the Program as an active employee and you are also covered by Medicare or Medicaid. Similarly, if you are covered under the Program as an active employee the Program is the Primary Plan for your cov ered spouse if your spouse is covered by Medicare. If you are not covered as an employee, the Student Health Program is Secondary to Medicare and Medicaid. In all cases, the Student Health Program is Secondary to Medicare or Medicaid if your domestic par tner is covered by Medicare or Medicaid. If someone is eligible for Medicare but does not enroll for Medicare, the Program will pay Secondary benefits as though he or she had enrolled for Medicare. The Student Health Program is the Primary Plan for your dependent children if they are covered by Medicaid or CHIP. When the Program is the Secondary Plan, it will deem the Primary Plan to have made all benefit payments that would have been made had you complied with all the rules of the Primary Plan. For example, if you fail to submit a claim on time to the Primary Plan or if you do not get the required preauthorization for treatment, the Program will make its Secondary Plan payment based on the payment the Primary Plan would have made if you submitted the cl aim on time or if you obtained the required preauthorization. If you are covered under the Program as a dependent child and you are also covered under your spouse's plan, your spouse's plan is the Primary Plan and the Program is the Secondary Plan. If none of the Coordination of Benefits rules in this section apply, then the plan that has covered the person in question for the longer period of time is the Primary Plan, and the plan that has covered the person for the shorter period of time is the Second ary Plan. OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR BENEFITS 54 When the Student Health Program May Recover Payment If you or your dependents have an injury, illness or other condition that is covered by the Student Health Program and for which a third party might be liable, you must notify Johns Hopkins E mployer Health Programs as soon as possible. You must comply with the Student Health Program's Reimbursement and Subrogation rights set forth below as a condition of receiving benefits. Failure to comply is grounds for denial of your claim. Reimbursemen t The Student Health Program's reimbursement provisions apply when you or your dependents receive, or in the future may receive, any amounts by settlement, verdict or otherwise, including from an insurance carrier, for an injury, illness or other conditio n. We call these amounts a \"Recovery\". For purposes of these reimbursement rules and the subrogation rules below, your dependents include your domestic partner. If you or your dependents have received a Recovery, the Program will subtract the amount of the Recovery from the benefits it would otherwise pay for treatment of the injury, illness or other condition. If there is a possible future Recovery, the Program may delay paying benefits until the Recovery is received, and then subtract the amount of th e Recovery. If the Program has already paid benefits to or on behalf of you or your dependents for treatment of an injury, illness or other condition, you or your dependents (or the legal representatives, estate or heirs of you or your dependents) must pr omptly reimburse the Program from any Recovery received for the amount of benefits paid by the Program. Reimbursement must be made regardless of whether you or your dependents are fully compensated (\"made whole\") by the Recovery. In order to secure the P rogram's reimbursement rights, by participating in the Program you and your dependents, to the full extent of the Program's claim for reimbursement, (1) grant the Program a first priority lien against the proceeds of any Recovery received; (2) assign to th e Program any benefits you or your dependents may have under any insurance policy or other coverage and (3) agree to hold in trust for the Program the proceeds of any Recovery received. You and your dependents are obligated to cooperate with the Program a nd its agents in order to protect the Program's reimbursement rights. Cooperation means providing the Program or its agents with any relevant information requested, signing and delivering any documents as the Program or its agents reasonably request, obta ining the written consent of the Program or its agents before releasing any party from liability, taking actions as the Program or its agents reasonably request to assist the Program in making a full recovery, and taking no action that may prejudice the Pr ogram's rights. OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR BENEFITS 55 The Program is only responsible for those legal costs to which it agrees in writing, and will not otherwise bear the legal costs of you and your dependents. If you take any action to prevent the Program from enforcing its reimbursement rights, you will also be liable to reimburse the Program for any legal expenses that the Program or its agents incur in enforcing the Program's reimbursement rights. Subrogation The Student Health Program's subrogation provisions apply when another party (including an insurance carrier) is or may be liable for your or your dependents' injury, illness or other condition, and the Student Health Program has already paid benefits for treatment of the injury, illness or other condition. The Program is subroga ted to all of your and your dependents' rights against any party (including an insurance carrier) that is or may be liable for your and your dependents' injury, illness or other condition or for paying for treatment of the injury, illness or other conditio n. The Program is subrogated to the extent of the amount of the benefits it pays to or on behalf of you or your dependents. The Program may assert its subrogation right independently of you and your dependents. You and your dependents are obligated to c ooperate with the Program and its agents in order to protect the Program's subrogation rights. Cooperation means providing the Program or its agents with any relevant information requested, signing and delivering any documents as the Program or its agents reasonably request, obtaining the written consent of the Program or its agents before releasing any party from liability, taking actions as the Program or its agents reasonably request to assist the Program in making a full recovery, and taking no action that may prejudice the Program's rights. If you or your dependents enter into litigation or settlement negotiations regarding the obligations of other parties, you and your dependents must not prejudice the Program's subrogation rights in any way. The Pr ogram's legal costs in subrogation matters will be borne by the Program. However, if you take any action to prevent the Program from enforcing its subrogation rights, you will be liable to reimburse the Program for any legal expenses that the Program or i ts agents incur in enforcing the Program's subrogation rights. Your and your dependents' legal costs will be borne by you and your dependents. Benefits Paid by Mistake If the Program pays benefits that you are not entitled to under the terms of the Prog ram, this is called a benefit paid by mistake. If the Program pays a benefit by mistake, the Program is entitled to recover OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR BENEFITS 56 the mistaken payment from the person it was paid to. If a mistaken payment is made to you, then you agree to hold the mistaken pay ment for the benefit of the Program and to repay it to the Program.

Coverage for a dependent will end on the earliest of the following dates: The date your coverage ends; The end of the month in which he/she no longer qualifies as an eligible dependent; The end of the month in which you elect to no longer cover your dependents und er the Student Health Program or the date you stop making required contributions for dependent coverage under the Program; The date your dependent enters military service. For certain of the above events, you or your dependents may be able to continue cov erage by self - payment under COBRA, as explained next. COBRA Continuation Coverage COBRA allows you, your spouse/domestic partner or former spouse/domestic partner, and your and your domestic partner's dependents to continue your Student Health Program medical coverage for a specified period of time after certain qualifying events take place. Except as explained below for newborn or adopted children, only persons who are actually covered under the Program on the date of the qualifying event may continue coverage under COBRA. You, your spouse/domestic partner, and your and your domestic partner's adult dependents have separate election rights. To continue coverage OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR BENEFITS 57 under COBRA, the covered person must pay the full premium rates, plus a two percent admini strative charge. The Student Health Program voluntarily provides COBRA rights to your domestic partner and your partner's dependents. COBRA rights for your domestic partner and your partner's dependents are not required by law, and are only provided as s et forth in this Summary Plan Description. Length of COBRA Coverage Coverage under the Student Health Program may be continued under COBRA for up to 18 months for you, your spouse/domestic partner, and your and your partner's eligible dependents, if coverage is lost due to your no longer being registered as a student with any of the schools that participate in the Program. Coverage may be continued for up to 24 months if you are also employed by one of the schools and your employment ends because you are called up for military duty that is covered by the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (commonly known as \"USERRA\"). Dependent children include children born to you or your domestic partner, adopted by you or your domestic partn er, or placed with you or your domestic partner for adoption while you or your domestic partner are covered under COBRA. For such a child to qualify for COBRA, you or your domestic partner must notify the Plan Administrator and elect COBRA coverage for th e new child as soon as possible, but in no case later than 30 days after the event .

If you, your spouse/domestic partner, or any of your or your domestic partner's dependents is Social Security disabled at any time during the first 60 days of COBRA coverage, coverage for the disabled individual, and each of the individual' s family members, may be extended for an additional 11 months, for a total of 29 months. Premiums for the additional 11 months will increase from 102% to 150% of the full cost. The Plan Administrator must be notified in writing of the Social Security dis ability within 60 days after the date of the determination and before the first 18 months of COBRA coverage ends, or the 11 additional months of COBRA coverage will not be provided. If the Social Security Administration notifies you, your domestic partner or any of your or your domestic partner's dependents that he or she is no longer disabled, then the additional 11 months of COBRA coverage no longer applies and you must notify the Plan Administrator within 30 days of the Social Security notice. Please contact the Plan Administrator if you have any questions about your eligibility. OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR BENEFITS 58 Your spouse/domestic partner and your or your domestic partner's dependent children may individually elect COBRA continuation coverage for up to 36 months after regular cove rage ends because of: Your divorce; Your legal separation; The end of your domestic partnership; Your entitlement to Medicare; or Your death.

Your and your domestic partner's dependent children may individually elect COBRA continuation coverage for up to 36 months after regular coverage ends if they stop being eligible for dependent coverage as explained under Who Is Eligible earlier in this SPD. In the case of divorce, separation, end of a domestic partnership, or a dependent child no lo nger being eligible for dependent coverage, you, your spouse/domestic partner, or your or your domestic partner's child must notify the Plan Administrator in writing within 60 days after that event occurs. If that notice is given on time, your spouse/dome stic partner or the dependent child will be notified of the right to continue coverage under COBRA.

You, your spouse/domestic partner, or your or your domestic partner's dependents will be notified of the right to continue coverage under COBRA if: You are no longer registered as a student with any school that participates in the Program; You die. If one of the above events that allow COBRA coverage to be continued for 36 months occurs after an event that allows COBRA coverage to be continued for 18 months but before the 18 months has expired, then COBRA coverage (if initially elected) may be continued for up to 36 months, measured from the date regular coverage ends because of the first event. If another event occurs, you, your spouse/domestic partner, or your or your domestic partner's dependent child must notify the Plan Administrator in wr iting within 60 days after the second event. If the Plan Administrator is not notified in time, COBRA may not be continued past 18 months. OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR BENEFITS 59 You must notify the Plan Administrator in writing if you, your spouse/domestic partner or a dependent child change addresses.

All premium p ayments must be made directly to the address shown on your COBRA election notice.

The Student Health Program will not pay any claims made in the interim. Upon reinstatement of coverage, invoices may be submitted or re - submitted to the Program for payment. If the Student Health Program benefits or coverage costs change, the COBRA coverage benefits and costs will change as well. Covered persons will be notified of any changes. The University Health Services Health Center ( UHSHC) only provides services to those persons who pay the student health fee, and their adult depe ndents. The UHSHC does not provide pediatric care. When COBRA Coverage Ends The right to COBRA continuation coverage will end before the conclusion of the coverage periods set forth above, whichever applies, if: OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR BENEFITS 60 A covered individual becomes covered under another group medical plan after COBRA coverage is elected (unless a pre -existing condition limitation would prevent the individual from receiving benefits from the new plan for a particular illness or injury); A covered individual becomes covered by Medicare after COBRA coverage is elected; The premium is not received on a timely basis; or The Student Health Program stops providing group medical coverage for all active students. When You Become Covered By Medica re If you are still an active participant when you become covered by Medicare, your Student Health Program coverage will coordinate with your Medicare coverage. Be sure to advise your health care provider that you have both coverages. Make clear to you r provider that your coverage under the Student Health Program is because you are a student. When you reach age 65, you will be eligible for Medicare benefits. You will not be covered by Medicare until you enroll. You may become eligible for Medicare be nefits at an earlier date if you become permanently disabled. The Student Health Program prescription drug benefit is, on average for all plan participants, expected to pay as much in benefits as the standard Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage wou ld be expected to pay. That means the Program's prescription drug benefit constitutes \"creditable coverage\" for Medicare Part D purposes. Medicare and End Stage Renal Disease If you have End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and need kidney dialysis treatment, you are generally eligible for Medicare starting with your fourth month of dialysis. You should enroll for Medicare Part A and Part B as soon as possible, regardless of your age. If you are eligible for Student Health Program coverage as an active emplo yee of your school, the Program will continue as your primary insurance for up to 30 months after your Medicare coverage can begin. Thereafter, or if you are eligible for Student Health Program coverage only as a student, the Program will only pay as your secondary insurance to the benefits provided by Medicare Part A and Part B. If you fail to enroll for Medicare Part A or Part B, the Student Health Program will still pay secondary to the benefits that would have been provided by Parts A and B as if you had enrolled. This could result in your having no coverage for the dialysis treatment until you enroll. Non-Discrimination in Benefits OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR BENEFITS 61 In accordance with Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, the Program will not deny or limit coverage of a claim or impose additional cost -sharing or other limitations or restrictions on coverage: on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability o the Program will not discriminate on the basis of pregnancy, gender identity, sex stereotyping and sexual orientation for sex -specific health services provided to transgender individuals just because the individual seeking such services identifies as belonging to another gender o the Program will not discriminate based on the fact that an individual's sex assigned at birth, gender identity or recorded gender is different than the one to which the health care services are ordinarily or exclusively available for specific health services related to gender transition if those result in discrimination against a transgender individual.

Plan Administrator The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine 733 N. Broadway Miller Research Building, Suite 147 Baltimore, MD 21205 Administrator Identification Number 52-0595110 Plan Number 513 Plan Sponsors The Student Health Program is sponsored by the Schools listed on page 2 under \"Who Is Eligible\" Agent for Legal Process Service of legal process may be made upon the Plan Administrator. Plan Year OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR BENEFITS 63 July 1 -- June 30. Source of Program Benefit Payments Benefits under the Program are paid from the general assets of the Schools that sponsor the Program. Benefits are not paid or administered by an insurance company. Prohibition On Assignment Of Benefits No benefit payment, or claim of a right to or cause of action for a benefit payment under the Program may be transferred or assigned to another person or entity, and no attempted transfer or assignment will be recognized by the Program. The Program may ma ke direct payment of benefits to providers in accordance with arrangements between the Program and the providers. However, such a payment does not make the provider an assignee, does not constitute acceptance by the Program of an attempt to assign a benef it payment or claim of right to or cause of action for a benefit payment, and in no way confers upon the provider any rights that a participant has under the Program, ERISA or other law. Claims And Appeals In order for you to receive medical benefits u nder the Program, you or your provider must file a claim. Claims are filed for you by EHP Network providers. An Out -of-Network provider can file your claim for you, but if your provider doesn't file the claim you must file it yourself. Following are the Program's procedures for filing claims and appealing claim denials. The Program's procedures do not apply until a claim is filed with Employer Health Programs. A \"claim\" is a request to Employer Health Programs for coverage of treatment you already recei ved or a request for preauthorization of coverage by Employer Health Programs for treatment you want to receive. A decision by your doctor or other provider that you do not need a certain treatment is not a claim covered by the procedures. The Program's procedures also apply to a determination by your school that you are not covered under the Program. If you are covered by the Program and it is determined that you are no longer entitled to coverage for a reason other than your failure to maintain enrollm ent or pay the required contribution (a \"Rescission Determination\"), your coverage will not end until you have exhausted your rights under these procedures. The filing requirements, and other procedures related to claims and appeals, differ depending on whether you have an \"Urgent Care Claim,\" a \"Pre -Service Claim\" or a \"Post -Service Claim\". There OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR BENEFITS 64 are special rules if a pre -approved course of treatment is reduced or terminated, or if you want to extend a pre -approved course of treatment. Urgent Care C laims, Pre -Service Claims and Post -Service Claims Certain services and supplies must be preauthorized by Utilization Management in order to be covered. See the earlier discussion in this SPD about Preauthorization Requirement -- Utilization Management and the Medical Benefits At -A-Glance chart. If a service or supply must be preauthorized, a request for preauthorization is a \"Pre -Service Claim\" . If a service or supply must be preauthorized and it is needed for Urgent Care, it is an \"Urgent Care Claim\" . A service or supply is for Urgent Care if following the time limits (set forth below) for Pre - Service Claims: could seriously jeopardize the life or health of the patient or the ability of the patient to regain maximum function, or in the opinion of a ph ysician with knowledge of the patient's medical condition, would subject the patient to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the service or supply, or could cause the patient to be in danger to self or others. In general, whether a service or supply is for Urgent Care is determined by Employer Health Programs based on the standards of a prudent layperson with average knowledge of health and medicine. However, if a physician with knowledge of the patient's medical condition determine s that the service or supply is for Urgent Care, it will be treated as such. If a service or supply does not need to be preauthorized, a claim for payment is a \"Post -Service Claim\" . Rescission Determination A \"Rescission Determination \" is a cancellatio n or discontinuance of coverage that has a retroactive effect, except to the extent it is attributable to a failure to pay required premiums or contributions towards the cost of coverage. The Program will provide 30 days advance written notice of any proposed Rescission of coverage for any individual. Filing a Claim See the Preauthorization Requirement - Utilization Management discussion earlier in this SPD for how to request preauthorization (for either a Pre -Service or Urgent Care Claim). OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR BENEFITS 65 To file a Po st-Service Claim, you, your provider or your Authorized Representative must complete and submit a claim form and attach itemized bills with the information described below. (Remember, an EHP Network provider will file claims for you.) Claims should be re ported promptly, and no claims will be accepted more than 18 months after the treatment was provided.

Claim forms are available from Johns Hopkins Employer Health Programs at www.ehp.org . To avoid delay in handling your claim, answer all questions completely and accurately. Claims cannot be processed without your signat ure where required on the form. Reducing or Terminating an Approved Course of Treatment If Utilization Management preauthorizes a specific period or number of treatments, it may in rare cases later determine that the preauthorized period or number of tre atments should be reduced or terminated. If that happens, Utilization Management will notify you in advance and give you time to file an appeal and receive a determination before the reduction or termination takes effect. Special time limits apply - - see \"Claims and Appeals Procedures\" below. If Utilization Management preauthorizes a course of treatment , the Program may not deny reimbursement to the Health Care Provider for the preauthorized treatment delivered to the patient unless: OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR BENEFITS 66 The information sub mitted regarding the treatment was fraudulent or intentionally misrepresentative; Critical information required by Utilization Management was omitted such that Utilization Management's determination would have been different had it known the critical infor mation; The preauthorized course of treatment for the patient was not substantially followed by the Health Care Provider; or On the date the preauthorized treatment was delivered: o the patient was not covered by the Program; o Employer Health Programs maintai ned an automated eligibility verification system that was available to the Health Care Provider by telephone or via the Internet; and o according to the verification system, the patient was not covered by the Program. Extending an Approved Course of Treatme nt If Utilization Management preauthorizes a specific period or number of treatments, and you or your provider want the period or number to be extended, you, your provider or your Authorized Representative must file a request to extend the approved course of treatment. A request that is filed before the additional treatment is provided is a Pre -Service Claim. A request that is filed after the additional treatment is provided is a Post -Service Claim.

OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR BENEFITS 87 Your Rights Under ERISA As a participant in the Student Health Program, you are entitled to the following rights and protections under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, common ly called ERISA: You can examine, free of charge, all of the official documents related to the Program (such as plan documents, insurance contracts, annual reports, SPDs, any other plan agreements, or any other documents filed with the U.S. Department of Labor). You can examine copies of these documents in the Plan Administrator's office. If you wish, you can get your own copies of the plan documents by writing to the Plan Administrator. You may have to pay a reasonable charge to cover the cost of phot ocopying. Additional ERISA Rights In addition to creating rights for Program participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the employee benefit plans. These people are called fiduciaries. ERISA requires that fiduciaries act prudently and solely in the interest of you and other Program participants and beneficiaries. Moreover, no one, including your employer or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way for the purpose of p reventing you from obtaining a benefit under these Programs or exercising your rights under ERISA. If your claim for a benefit is denied in whole or in part, you must receive a written explanation of the reason for the denial. You have the right to have t he Plan Administrator review and reconsider your claim. Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request certain materials from the Program and do not receive them within 31 days, you may file suit in a federal court to enforce your rights. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Plan Administrato r. If you have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or federal court. If it should happen that plan fiduciaries misuse the plan's money, or if you are discriminated against for asserting your rig hts, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a federal court. OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR BENEFITS 88 The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If you are successful, the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and fees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example if it finds your claim is frivolous. If you have any questions about this Program, you should contact the Plan Administrator. If you have any questions about thi s statement or your rights under ERISA, you should contact the nearest Area Office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, as listed in the telephone directory, or contact the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiri es, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Ave., NW, Washington, D.C., 20210.

You will be notified of any changes to this Program and how they affect your benefits, i f at all. You should not rely on any oral descriptions of the Program, since the written description in this SPD will always govern. To the extent any benefits under the Program are provided by an insurance policy, no benefits are provided by the Program except for those benefits, if any, which are paid by the insurance company which issues the policy. Plan Administrator's Authority The Plan Administrator has discretionary authority to interpret the terms of the Student Health Program and to decide any questions of fact which relate to entitlement to benefits under the Program.
