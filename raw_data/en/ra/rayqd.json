Greg West, EOS UBC). Colder temperatures may have assisted in perpetuating norovirus survival during this outbreak. 1. What environmental factors influence the risk of norovi rus in oysters? Many environmental factors can contribute to the survival of norovirus. Key factors identified through a search of relevant scientific literature were cooler water temperatures (1-5), low humidity (6), low salinity (7-9), high rainfall (1, 10, 11) impacting on river flows (12), and seasonality. However, these are not absolute fac tors that fit every situation. F or example, norovirus outbreaks in the southern hemisphere do not always follow the same pattern of winter/cold temperature outbreaks seen in the northern hemisphere (13), and norovirus outbreaks associated with warm water temperatures can be seen in countries such as Mexico (7). Here, further details are g iven on environmental factors that contribute to norovirus survival in oceanic conditions: temperature, humidity, rainfall, solar radiation (sunlight), and other environmental factors such as gage height and wind currents. How they interact with sewage co ntamination sources is briefly reviewed. TEMPERATURE Colder water temperatures, typically occurring through late fall and winter, are associated with increased norovirus survival. Temperatures between -6.6 and 20 \u00b0C favour the prevalence of norovirus (13). Oysters from waters around England and Wales from temperatures lower than 5\u00b0C contained significantly more norovirus compared to oysters from waters 10\u00b0C or greater (1). It was suggested that metabolic activity of oysters decreases at colder temperatures, thus slowing virus depuration. Norovirus was detected in oysters up to and including six weeks held at 7 and 15\u00b0C under depuration conditions, while at 25\u00b0C, norovirus was detected only at two an d four weeks. By four weeks, the amount of norovirus present had more than halved from the first week. The explanation given was that \"cooler water temperatures extend norovirus clearance time\" (2). In South Korea (14) and Japan (15), a strong negative correlation was observed between temperature and relative humidity, with norovirus survival. Data gathered in England Environmental Health Services, BCCDC Page 9 of 64 Relative humidity during the BC norovirus outbreak showed a wet November and March, a normal December and February, and a dry January (pers. comm. Greg West, EOS UBC). The dry, cold January seen in 2017 may have played a part in prolonging the norovirus outbreak; however, earlier wet and normal RH observed appear opposite to trends reported in the literature, although not all studies agree on RH in this context. During the BC norovirus outbreak (Dec 2016 - Mar 2017), a near -record wet November was recorded, while December, January, and February were slightly drier than normal (pers. comm. Greg West, EOS UBC). and Wales showed a relationship between an increase in norovirus (as per laboratory reports) with low temperature over the previous seven weeks, and low relative humidity over the previous five weeks. However, low temperature in the previous week had the strongest effect, with more norovirus cases reported. Further, low population immunity and emergence of new genotypes played a role in increased norovirus reports (16). Murine norovirus (as a surrogate for human norovirus) exposed to monochloramine (a disinfectant) for two hours at 4\u00b0C was a lmost unchanged, but when held at 25\u00b0C, norovirus was undetectable after the same period (4). By contrast, norovirus outbreaks ca n still occur in warm waters (7), although investigators measured water temperature after transporting samples back to the laboratory, which could have influenced their findings. Nonetheless, temperatures in the two study bays, Altata beach and Mazatlan in Mexico, reach 25 t o 31\u00b0C and 25 to 29\u00b0C in spring, respectively, and range from 32 to 38\u00b0C and 30 to 36\u00b0C in summer, respectively. Norovirus presence in water was found to decrease as temperatures increased. Thus, cooler water temperatures favour norovirus survivability. HUMIDITY Humidity affects norovirus infectivity and survival by acting primarily on the capsid structure (6). Humidity is typically measured as either absolute humidity (AH) or relative humidity (RH). AH is a measure of the actual amount of water vapour in an air sample and is typically presented a s grams of water vapour/kg of dry air. RH, often given as a percentage, is the ratio of AH to the amount of water vapour that would be needed to saturate the air sample. RH is temperature dependent (6). As noted above, researchers observed that both low temperature and low RH were associated with an increase in norovirus survival. (14, 16) Contradictory evidence in another study found increased norovirus survival and infectivity when murine norovirus was held at 9\u00b0C at both low and high RH (10% and 100%), whereas 9\u00b0C at 50% RH was detrimental to survival and infectivity. (6) At a higher Environmental Health Services, BCCDC Page 10 of 64 Extreme rain events trigger storm water and sewage overflows. Continued overflows during the (wet) month of November could have been a key factor in triggering this norovirus event. It would also have increased river flows and decreased salinity, both factors associated with an increase in norovirus contamination, and possibly survival. Conversely, increased rainfall could have increased dilution of norovirus. temperature, 25\u00b0C, infectious norovirus particles were detected at low (10% and 35%) but not high (55 to 100%) RH. After further data analyse s, AH rather than RH appeared to be more critical for norovirus infectivity when AH was below 0.007 kg water/kg air, regardless of temperature, leading the authors to conclude that \"winter conditions and especially low AH... corresponding to a temperate clim ate... provide the ideal conditions for keeping human norovirus infectious...\" (6). RH is an important factor for norovirus survival and transmission, and the majority of studies conclude low RH is important. However, not all studies agree (13), as described in the AH work (6). Further research is necessary to determine the relationship between RH, AH, and norovirus survival. RAINFALL An increase in GII norovirus genotype was observed during rainfall events (10), while rainfall was one of the key factors affecting norovirus contamination in shellfisheries, along with season, and tidal cycle (11). Contamination of shellfisheries resulted after a concurrent gastroenteritis outbreak in the coastal population and heavy rainfall (17). Rainfall from 1 day to 3 months before an outbreak can favour norovirus prevalence (13). However, in direct contrast to these findings, a study using laboratory surveillance data from Eng land and Wales noted that recent cumulative rainfall was not associated with norovirus incidence (16).No association between rainfall and norovirus was observed in two species of oysters in waters around England and Wales (1). RIVER FLOWS Increased river flows are often associated with heavy rainfall events and/or snow melt. High river flows have been associated with an increased risk of norovirus contamination (1, 3, 12) . Cumulative river flow in the 7 days prior to sampling was found to be a significant variable contributing to norovirus GI in England and Wales (1). Environmental Health Services, BCCDC Page 11 of 64 Reduced solar radiation at the start of the outbreak may have provided one of the conditions allowing this outbreak to begin and continue, although subsequent sunnier than normal months should have counteracted this effect. Sunshine hours during this outbreak could be further investigated. Other environmental factors associated with norovirus abundance or survival: Suspended particulate matter Human population density Sewage content Gage height Water mixing Wind and currents Tidal cycles Factors NOT associated with norovirus: Agricultural sources Tidal flows Similarly, norovirus outbreaks in Lake Ontario, Toronto, were associated with both cold lake temperatures (< 4\u00b0C) and high flows in the previous 1 to 7 days in the Don River (3). SALINITY To create a model to predict oyster norovirus outbreaks, 21 years of norovirus and environmental data collected from Louisiana oyster harvesting areas along the Gulf of Mexico coast, USA, was used (5). Salinity was included when deciding on what factors to examine in the model because low salinity has been found to enhance virus binding to sediment particles (8). Low salinity was found to be amongst the most important predictive factors of norovirus outbreaks (5). Studies conducted in Mexico (7) and Japan (15) found decreasing salinity favoured norovirus survivability. Rainfall is clearly a very important factor to consider in norovirus outbreaks - it incr eases river flows, which would speed the flushing of norovirus to the ocean but also potentially increase dilution; it decreases salinity, which, via various mechanisms, facilitates norovirus survival; and it drives sewage and storm water overflows. Sewage and storm water overflows occur after heavy rainfalls overload the treatment capacity of the system, sending raw sewage and contaminated water into the aquatic environment (1),(8, 13) . Viruses can bind to fine sediment particles and salinity may enhance thi s binding process. As a result, viruses are protected by marine sediment and may persist in an infectious state for several months, especially when salinity is low (8). Heavy rainfalls may then re -suspend sediments, or wash sediments and associated virus particles down rivers and into the ocean (13). Consequently, rainfall can be an important factor causing norovirus release into the environment. Environmental Health Services, BCCDC Page 12 of 64 Inferred solar rad iation during the BC norovirus outbreak, as per other weather conditions at the time, showed a very cloudy October, November and March, and slightly sunnier than normal December, January, February (pers. comm. Greg West, EOS UBC). SOLAR RADIATION Sunlight, or more specifically, solar UV radiation, is a natural virucidal agent in the outdoor environment, killing viruses by chemically modifying their DNA and RNA. Sunlight radiation is the main factor for viral reduction (13). UV can reduce the number of murine norovirus particles, lending weight to the idea that exposure to sunlight ki lls norovirus (18). Using a 36W lamp, after 120 hours of UV disi nfection, murine NOV showed a more than 3 log 10 reduction, and infectious murine NoV was not detected after only 72 hours of UV disinfection. However, limitations to UV treatment are turbidity and dissolved salts (18). OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS Numerous other factors can potentially play a role in norovirus contamin ation and outbreaks. For example, the combination of light intensity, water mixing, sewage content, and suspended particulate matter determine the abundance and distribution of fecal indicator organisms in the marine environment (9). In studying norovirus in oy sters in England and Wales, human population density in the catchment area was positively associated with norovirus, while the combined volume of continuous sewage discharges from the catchment was a predictive factor for total norovirus (GI + GII)(1). Extremely low gage height (i.e., depth of oyster beds), together with low temperature, low salinity, increased rainfall on the 9th day before an outbreak, and a strong offshore wind, were all associated with increases in (model -predicted probabilities) of norovirus outbreaks (5). Low gage height is essentially low water depth, and may result in a decrease in dilution of virus particles coming from sewage contaminated waters. Heavy rainfall causing sewage system failures and discharge of untreated sewage ha s been discussed previously, and would potentially allow winds to carry virus particles to oyster beds. This was the only study reviewed here that mentioned gage height as an important factor in oyster norovirus outbreaks, and it was also deemed the most important of the factors in the model. Environmental Health Services, BCCDC Page 13 of 64 Average transit times for Salish Sea waters are e.g., Vitoria to Tofino, approximately 2 weeks; Fraser River to Victoria, approximately weeks; and Iona to the Northern Strait of Georgia, in the vicinity of months. The Fraser River flow drives most of the circulation in the Salish Sea, but nothing unusual in circulation or oceanic conditions was observed around the outbreak (pers. comm. Rich Pawlowicz, EOS UBC) i.e., wind directions and currents were observed to be w ithin normal limits. The role of human -made features in norovirus outbreaks in South Korea found that small -scale, low -tech local sewage treatment plants i.e., discharge of poorly treated sewage, and winter sport areas, specifically ski resorts, where h igh densities of people accumulate in a small area, were statistically significant factors favouring norovirus outbreaks (19). In regards to the Salish Sea and local BC conditions, long distance transport of norovirus was deemed possible but unlikely by one knowledge expert (pers. comm. Rich Pawlowicz, EOS UBC). However, some factors have been dismissed in the literature and a re not regarded as important in norovirus contamination. For example, agricultural sources were considered unlikely to be a significant risk for human norovirus contamination (GI and GII) (1). Tidal flows did not affect norovirus levels in oysters (12). By contrast, tidal cycle, along with rainfall and season, was one of t he key factors affecting norovirus contamination in shellfisheries (11). WIND AND CURRENTS Local wind and current conditions can facilitate norovirus dispersal and distance travelled. However, these conditions are very localized and it is hard to make generalizations from one study area to another because of this variation. A recent review paper noted there is a \"significant lack of informatio n about the role of wind in influencing norovirus infections\" (13). One study did model both wind speed and direction as an environmental predictor and found onshore winds cause water levels to rise at the coast, and offshore winds cause water levels to fall. Wind was found to be one of the top three predictors of norovirus outbreaks, after gage height and water temperature (5). Locally, dominant winds in the Strait of Georgia and the Juan de Fuca blow from the northwest in summer and the southeast in winter. Northwesterlies blow along the coast of Vancouver Island in summer, moving coastal waters offshore and lowering the sea l evel. In winter, winds blow in the opposite direction, moving water onshore and causing Environmental Health Services, BCCDC Page 14 of 64 Figure 1. Possible sources of norovirus contamination related to sewer sytems and waste treatment. sea levels to rise (20). One hypothesis that could explain onshore winds driving a norovirus outbreak is that coastal contamination is blown back to shore and over shellfish farms, rather than being carried out to sea and diluted. 2. Major sources of sewage OVERVIEW How does sewage enter the marine environment ? How is norovirus transmit ted from infected humans to the ocean and shellfish farms? Infected individuals can shed up to 109 virus copies per gram of feces (21), while asymptomatic individuals can shed virus for over a month (22). An infectious dose is as little as 18 virus particles (23). Thus, even a small number of norovirus -infected individuals can contaminate sewage systems and in turn contaminate shellfish, rapid ly transmitting norovirus (24) (25). Most fresh and marine water s are vulnerable to sewage pollution from various sources depending on geography, population density, regulations governing sewage managemen t, and sewerage infrastructure. Discharges of sewage can enter the marine e nvironment directly or may be introduced into water systems upstream before eventually draining into the ocean. Sewage contamination sources are often categorized as: Point source : treated effluent from municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) discharged into the environment via outfall pipes; Non-point source: municipal drainage works, urban and agricultural runoff, discharges to ground from on -site sewage system s (normally septic tanks), and discharges from vessels (26). Other sources may contribute to both point or non -point contamination, such as combined s ewer overflows (CSOs), sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs), and storm tank overflows (STOs) (27) (Figure 1). Th ese sources will be defined and discussed in this review. Environmental Health Services, BCCDC Page 15 of 64 The rate at which contaminants enter the environment can be increased by large rainfall events and physical damage to, or faulty installation of, sewerage infrastructure. In British Columbia (B C), sewage discharges into the environment are governed by the Environmental Management Act (EMA) (28), which contains the Municipal Sewage Regulation (MSR) (29) and Municipal Wastewater Regulation (30). These regulations are informed by the Canada -wide Strategy for the Management of Municipal Wastewater Effluent (31). According to BC legislation, land owners with built structures on the land \"must ensure that all domestic sewage originating from the structure[s] is discharged int o: i) a public sewer, ii) a holding tank, iii) a sewerage system\". Excess rainfall is a common trigger for sewage -related norovirus outbreaks and other enteric pathogens affecting shellfish and drinking/recreational waters. Runoff can become particularly contaminated with sewage when rainfall occurs following a period of dry weather, du ring which contaminants build up in stream sediment, storm drains, and other collection points. When rain arrives it triggers a \"first flush\" into the environment containing a higher -than-normal loading of virus and other pathogens. (8) A review on the subject of norovirus outbreaks associated with shellfish noted that \"the most common rou te for accidental contamination is sewage overflow and discharge into the aquatic environment during heavy rainfall events\" (8). One of the earliest documented examples of rainfall as a trigger was an outbreak of gastroenteritis in Australia caused by sewa ge contamination of oyster farms after a period of heavy ra infall. Interestingly, the rainfall was heavy although not unusual, similar to the situation in BC in 2016 (32). Another outbreak in 1982 in New York state associated with oysters and clams was linked to sewage -contaminated coastal waters following heavy rainfall (33). Excess rainfall has been noted during several norovirus outbreaks and instances of contamination in oyster production a reas in France (17, 34, 35) . One outbreak summary reported: \"before the first outbreak, up to 150 mm of rai nfall occurred Environmental Health Services, BCCDC Page 16 of 64 in less than 1 week, resulting in runoff and river overflow and sewage treatment system failures. Before the second outbreak up to 76 mm of rain fell in 1 day, much more than the monthly average of 65.18 mm\" (8). Modeling studies in France have also predicted that fecal contaminant concentrations in tributaries feeding she llfish farms are highest following rainfall events (36). Runoff from rainfall can contain many infectious pathogens and toxins from multiple sources. Agricultural runoff can contain zoonotic pathogens, while industr ial runo ff may contain chemical contaminants. Microbial source tracking is a useful tool for determining the origin of sewage, allowing differentiation between pathogens of animal and human sources (37-39). For this review, we are interested in runoff containing human sewage, as this is the main source of human norovirus. It is not always possible to pinpoint a single cause of oyster farm contamination, because runoff can originate from many sources before arriving at the same marine outfall (40). A study of seven UK oyster catchments found that no single sewage source made up more than 70% of contaminated runoff (41). Thus, contamination events and associated illness outbreaks require detailed localized environmental investigations to conclude whether a particular sewage source is the culprit. Additionally, experiments using shellfish indicated that repeated lower level exposure to sewage produces a similar level of viral accumulation as a single large exposure, suggesting that shellfish farms near chronic low -level sources of sewage may be similarly at risk as those subject to large contamination events (42). This suggests that ongoing monitoring of shellfish and shellfish water quality near any point or non -point sewage source is essential, although commonly used measurements of fecal bacteria have been found to correlate poorl y with norovirus concentration in shellfish tissue (34, 43) . The following sections describe ma jor sources of human sewage as well as any relevant research studies, and descriptions of outbreaks of norovirus and enteric human pathogens related to these specific sources. Throughout, Environmental Health Services, BCCDC Page 17 of 64 research and outbreaks concerning shellfish farming are highlight ed. SEPTIC TANKS AND OTH ER ON -SITE SEWAGE SYSTEMS Septic tanks or on -site sewage disposal systems (OSDS) are used in areas that cannot be connected to municipal sewer systems. Septic tanks usually serve a maximum of 150 people. Onsite systems have a tan k in which sewage solids collect and settle out, while the remaining liquid flows through a network of perforated pipes into the surrounding disposal field (figure 2). Figure 2. Sche matic of septic tank and ground disposal field (image from Ministry of Environment) During this process, wastewater is filtered by soil, gravel, and naturally -occurring bacteria in the disposal field. There are around 250,000 on -site systems in BC (44). There are various types of on -site systems with different disinfection add-ons that can improve the quality of discharge released into the environment (45). Environmental Health Services, BCCDC Page 18 of 64 Holding tanks are watertight containers for storing sewage until it can be pumped out for treatment. These tanks are used in areas were soil type is not appropriate for septic tanks and fields. Most jurisdictions have a minimum \"set -back\" distance that an on -site system or holding tank must be placed from ground water sources in order to prevent contamination. In BC, a holding tank mu st be at least 15 m from a well, and a septic tank must be at least 30 m from a well (section 3.1 of sewerage system regulation of public health act) (46). Septic systems and illness The most common way for septic systems to infi ltrate the environment and cause illness is via the contamination of groundwater or marine environments where shellfish are grown. Multivariate analysis found that a higher density of septic systems was associated with viral diarrhea in the United States, where around 25% of households use septic systems. (47). The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designates areas with more than 40 septic systems per square mile as potential ground water contamination zones (48). The CDC reported that 67% of outbreaks caused by groundwa ter contamination were a result of improperly installed or maintained septic systems (49). A Public Health Agency of Canada meta -analysis of 55 studies found that septic systems were an important contributor to ground water contamination. (50). Sampling of drinking water wells in combination with geographical mode ling in Arizona suggested that decay rates of virus (MS -2 coliphage) differed according to factors such as temperature, hydraulic gradient, and soil composition. Researchers found that depending on these factors, certain septic system sites would require s et-back distances from ground water as much as 150m. This meant that use of a single recommended set -back distance does not capture real geographic variability (51). Another study found that increased septic tank density was associated with higher levels of norovirus in the runoff from Environmental Health Services, BCCDC Page 19 of 64 streams into the ocean, affecting the risk of swimmers contracting illness (52). Norovirus and other enteric pathogens have been detected along the Florida co ast, associated with septic system seepage into adjacent canals that lead to the Atlantic Ocean (53). It was found that greater density of on -site systems was associated with higher detected levels of enteric pathogens (including viruses). Researchers noted that \"the majority of the septic systems in this region...were installed prior to 1983 and do not meet the standards for Florida set -back distances\" (54) Further work in the region, employing viral tracers seeded into septic tanks, found that virus could enter adjacent canals and subsequently the wi der ocean in a matter of hours (55, 56) .There have been various outbreaks of norovirus and other enteric viruses associated with s eptic systems, summarized in table 1.

Sewer system overflows are described as either wet or dry weather overflows. Wet weather overflows are a resu lt of excess rainfall or snow melt. Dry weather overflows are any overflows not caused by precipitation, such as sewer line blockages, line breaks, or pumping station power failures (63). Sewage overflows are most commonly associated with three types of sewer system infrastructure: sanitary sewers, combined sewers, and storm tanks . Overflows in these structures are often related to WWTP failure during wet weather, however in this review we will discuss the three overflow types separately from WWTPs. Sanitary sewer pipes transport sewage from buildings to waste water treatment facilities, and exclusively contain sewage and other waste water. Overflow events associated with these pipe networks are called sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) , and can be either wet or dry weather overflows. In both situations, raw se wage is released into the ground or a body of water before it reaches a water treatment facility. Wet weather SSOs are a result of rainwater inflow through flooding or improperly installed/damaged pipes that exceeds the sewer's capacity, leading to floodin g and leakage. Dry weather SSOs can occur when sewer pipes are installed incorrectly or pipes become damaged due to accidents or lack of maintenance. In Metro Vancouver, SSOs in seven sites have automated sampling (64). Monitoring is meant to \"inform decisions on potential management options, including collection of data required for design of mitigation infrastructure, if required.\" Combined sewers are designed to collect sewage from buildings as well as surface runoff from precipitation. Canadian national standards do not allow new construction of combined sewers, although existing ones may be maintained (31). Environmental Health Services, BCCDC Page 22 of 64 When these types of sewers overflow it is called a combined sewer overflow (CSO) . Such overflows are almost always wet weather events, especially during storms when the amount of storm water exceeds the capacity of the waste water treatment facility. Combined sewers are designed to discharge excess waste water into the environment und er these conditions, similar to a bathtub trap. (26) Figure 3. Combined sewer during normal and overflow conditions. Taken from: http://danieloverbey.blogspot.ca/20 14/10/indianapolis -digs-deep -to-fix- its.html Storm tanks are often attached to WWTPs in o rder to collect excess rainfall runoff or CSO discharge in a separate basin prior to treatment, thus preventing overload of the plant. Storm tank overflows (STOs) occur when rainfall exceeds these tanks' capacity. When CSOs or STOs occur, a combination of storm water and untreated sewage is released, increasing viral load in the receiving environment (65). Several studies investigating the concentration of norovirus throughout sewage treatment plant and adjacent storm overflow tanks found that storm tank discharges represented th e main risk of norovirus contamination to local oyster farms (1, 12, 66) . Some suggested that the nor ovirus \"risk can be estimated on the basis of the overall volume of sewage discharged into the [shellfish production area] and therefore [norovirus] Environmental Health Services, BCCDC Page 23 of 64 contamination will be dependent on the site -specific sewerage discharge arrangements\" (1). More locally, the Greater Vancouver Regional District conducted a watershed -based assessment that looked at the contributions of WWTPs, CSOs, SSOs, and urban storm water runoff, and identified that CSOs have had a \"confirmed impact\" on local marine embayments (bays), despite being actively phased out (67). This study did not measure norovirus or ba cterial pathogens, however combined oxygen demand (COD) was measured, which is an indicator of organic matter in water. In 2014, Metro Vancouver's Liquid Waste Department reported that 20 CSOs operate in the region, which are monitored via the CSO Monitoring Program (64). Using weather forecasting data, the automatic samplers at each site take specimens prior to and during the first flush of wet weath er events. Specimens are tested for metals, turbidity, and for microbiological indicators including E.coli , enterococci, and fecal coliform. Norovirus is not routinely tested for. The region reported 28.07 million square meters of CSO discharge during 2014 (64). CSOs can be mitigate d by building larger or additional overflow basins and storm tanks to handle excess rainfall, thus improving environmental water quality (68). Adding UV disinfection to storm tanks has been identified as a way to prevent norovirus contamination of oyster beds (66). An extensive study in the UK described sanitary profiles of UK shellfish farm sites before and after sewerage system upgrades such as expansion of storm tanks, removal of combined sewers, and WWTP upgrades, finding that faecal coliform co unts were reduced by 39 -88% (41). Existing combined sewers can become prone to overflow as urbanization changes the amount of rainfall runoff entering the sewer. While CSOs are slowly being replaced in many countries including Canada, existing combined sewers are vulnerable to overflow bec ause of increasingly common extreme rainfall events associated with climate change . Researchers have identified climate change -induced CSOs as a growing threat to human health via their adverse impact on water quality in shellfish farms (69, 70) and recreational bathing areas (71). Environmental Health Services, BCCDC Page 24 of 64 A model built to estimate the impact of CSOs on shellfish farms closures in France found that rainfall events causing a \"viral flux from an ill population may reach shellfish beds through raw -water overflows. For the moment this sort of event is still quite rate, occurring only once every 8 years . However, depending on the hydrodynamic conditions, contaminated waters where viruses are present could stay for several days on shellfish beds. If climate change increased the number of extreme rainfall events, this would dramatically lead to long periods of shellfish bed c losures\" (70). The BC Ministry of Environment advises developers of Liquid Waste Management Plans that \"One of the most fundamental issues associated with storm water management is the need to integrate the initial stages of th e land use planning process with local watershed hydrology. If land development is undertaken without consideration of watershed hydrology, some of the most important opportunities for minimizing the adverse environmental impacts of the development may be lost\" (26) Table 2.

(83) WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLAN TS OVERVIEW OF WASTEWAT ER TREATMENTS Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are designed to remove organic and chemical contaminants in wastewater gathered through sewer and storm pipes. The material entering a WWTP is termed influent, wh ile the water leaving a WWTP is termed effluent.1 During regular function, influent passes through a screen that removes large solids and debris. The screened wastewater is then subjected to primary, secondary, and/or tertiary treatment depending on the system in place. (45, 84) A video of the Annacis WWTP in Delta, BC illustrates bar screening at the influent pump station removing assorted debris, such as sticks and rags at the beginning of this plant's WWTP process (https://vimeo.com/218315462 ).(85) 1 A glossary of key terminology associated with wastewater treatment plants and processes is given in Appendix 1. Environmental Health Services, BCCDC Page 27 of 64 Figure 4. Annacis Island WWTP (source: metrovancouver.org) Primary treatment involves wastewater being pumped into a large tank where sludge is allowed to settle in purpose - built ponds or tanks, known as waste stabilization ponds, settling ponds, or clarifier tanks. In the Annacis WWTP video, sand and grit is settled out in aerated tanks, followed by removal of fats and oils, which are skimmed from the surface of primary sedimentation tanks. (85) In these tanks, heavy organic material will settle. Secondary tr eatment involves the addition of air (oxygen) to wastewater to enhance the ability of bacteria and microorganisms to break down organic matter. Trickling filters are used in the Annacis WWTP. Wastewater is sprayed onto the top of vertical columns of plast ic media, the wastewater trickles down the column. The plastic media trays provide over 13,000 square metres of total surface area for bacteria and slime to consume the suspended organic matter that did not settle out in the primary tanks. This activity occurs within four plastic domed areas of the plant (Figure 4).(85) This more recent type of secondary treatment is known as membrane bioreactor technology, Environmental Health Services, BCCDC Page 28 of 64 whereby a fine screen or film is used as a frame for bacteria, algae, and fungi to grow upon. Membrane bioreactor technol ogy is increasingly used in WWTPs because it is easily added during plant retrofitting. (86) Wastewater lagoons are also commonly used to improve water quality during the wastewater treatment process. When properly used, they are considered equivalent to secondary treatment, although cold climates reduce their effectiveness. (45) They are often used in smaller communities, and remove organics and nitrogen loads from wastewater. Following secondary treatment, s ome plants have advanced or tertiary treatment processes that remove viruses, bacteria, phosphorous, ammonia and other dissolved compounds using various chemical and/or biological techniques. The most common tertiary treatments include disinfection via exp osure to ultraviolet light (UV), chlorine, and ozone. (45) Ozone and UV are preferred over chlorine as dechlorination is re quired for effluent discharging to waters containing aquatic life. (87) An overview of the types of WWTP treatments are given in Tab le 4 and Figure 5. Sludge formation occurs during primary and secondary treatments. Primary sludge consists of settled solids. Activated sludge is wastewater with bacteria and other microorganisms in suspension. These remove organics, ammonium, and nit rogen from the water and solids as part of the wastewater treatment process. (45) Some WWTPs add flocculation agents to the activated sludge to trap or attract particulate matter in clumps, called wooly -looking masses, or floc, which can then be removed. An important component of sludge treatment is to reduce the water content and ultimately the cost of disposal. Sludge is co mmonly disposed of via land application e.g., spread on agricultural land, forests, and/or land reclamation sites. Sludge undergoes treatment such as digestion, composting, heating, or other methods in order to reduce microbial loads and remove water. Dewa tered sludge can also be disposed of in landfills or burnt in incinerators. After treatment, effluent from coastal communities may be discharged into seawater via outfall pipes, while effluent from non-coastal communities is often discharged into streams, rivers, or lakes. Environmental Health Services, BCCDC Page 29 of 64 Table 4: Wastewater treatment classification (45, 88) Stage / type of treatment Treatment Type of treatment Primary Mainly physical removal processes Preliminary Coarse solids/debris removed with screen before waste water enters settling tank where grit and sand is removed. Sedimentation Suspended solids partly removed by settling out, chemical coagulation, or filtration. Secondary Mainly biological removal processes Attached growth processes/fixed film Tricking filters, biotowers, biological contactors provide a growth medium for bacteria, algae, and fungi to grow and consume organic matter in the waste water. Suspended growth processes (activated sludge) Aerobic bacteria break down organic matter in aeration tanks for several hours. As bacteria accumulate and grow they are removed as \"activated sludge\" Lagoons Lagoons/ treatment ponds 3'to 5' deep, allowing sunlight, bacteria, and oxygen to work together to remove organic matter. Lagoons alone are considered equivalent to secondary treatment. Disinfection treatments Chemical removal of microbes (bacteria and virus) Used with secondary & tertiary treatments Disinfection treatments by chlorine, UV, ozone are often used to supplement primary and secondary WWTP. They may also be used in advanced tertiary treatments. Chlorine Destroys cellular material of microorganisms. Chlorine residue by - product remains in water post treatment, so de -chlorination is often required. UV Leaves no by -product. Damages genetic material in microbes, so they cannot reproduce. Virus may be detectable, but not infective. Ozone Produces fewer by -products than chlorine. Effective at destroying bacteria and viruses. Tertiary or Advanced Treatments for discharge to fragile ecosystems Lagoons or wetland constructions, physical methods further remove phosphorous, nitrogen and BOD Nitrification via lagoons, wetlands Additional biological treatment to allow nitrifying bacteria to convert ammonia to non -toxic nitrate. De-nitrification (e.g., Modified Ludzack -Ettinger) Nitrates are converted to nitrogen gas by methane bacteria in anoxic (zero oxygen) environment. Important in areas where excess nitrate in effluent causes algae blooms. Coagulation - Sedimentation Alum, lime or iron salts are added to remove phosphorous. Physical separation methods Ion exchange, reverse osmosis, membrane filtration and other techniques are used to further polish waste -water and remove dissolved contaminants, organic pollutants, heavy metals, and remaining bacteria and virus. Environmental Health Services, BCCDC Page 30 of 64 Figure 5. Wastewater Process Flow Diagram . (84) Environmental Health Services, BCCDC Page 31 of 64 For example, the discharge pipe in the Victoria outfall is 1.8 km long. For smaller systems, tile fields can also be used as discharge points. CSOs Some WWTPs receive both wastewater and storm water. The infrastructure associated with these types of plants is called Combined Sewers (CS). Combined sewer systems can be overwhelmed by storm water, which can result in waste and storm water by -passing the water treatment plant without receiving treatment before discharging directly to the environment. This type of scenario is a Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO), as described in sewerage network overflows, covered in the previous section . WASTEWATER TREATMENT IN CANADA Federal Regulations Federally regulated WWTPs follow the Wastewater Systems Effluent Regulations ( SOR/2012 -139).(89) Federal regulations cover two types of WWTP - intermittent efflue nt discharge and continuous effluent discharge. In both cases, the WWTP must have monitoring systems in place to measure either the volume of wastewater or the rate of flow. The composition of the wastewater at the point of effluent discharge are sampled v ia grab samples, with sampling frequency varying from once every two weeks, to three days per week, depending on the discharge volume. Testing effluent discharge involves providing samples to a laboratory accredited by the International Organization for Standardization and the Environment Quality Act. All reports received from the laboratory must be kept along with WWTP records recording the days when CSO events occurred. A CSO report must be compiled and submitted annually to the authorization officer. Th e report must state the volume or estimated volume, and number of days in each month during which effluent was discharged through CSOs. All records and reports must be kept for five years. Municipal Regulations in BC The regulations that govern municipality wastewater treatment for BC are found in the Municipal Wastewater Regulation under the Environmental Management Act ( B.C. Environmental Health Services, BCCDC Page 32 of 64 Reg. 87/2002 ).(30) Municipal regulations overlap, but also go beyond the Federal regulations . Municipal regulations cover registration of the WWTP, which includes providing details for a local contact person, the name of the WWTP operator, the address of the WWTP, and technical information regarding the WWTP. One section deals with environmental impact studies for WWTPs, including how they should be conducted, by whom, and what should be monitored. General operating plans, securit y and assurance plans (in the event the WWTP needs to be replaced), and component and reliability requirements for wastewater facilities are some of the additional regulations within the act, which identify exactly what one would need in order to build and run a WWTP in BC. Guidelines for what and how often measurements should be taken at WWTPs have been set at the Federal and Municipal level and are summarized in Table 2, while effluent requirements from the BC Municipal Wastewater Regulation are given i n Table 3. (30, 89) . Many WWTP routinely test effluent samples for bacteria and indicators for viruses, but never for noroviruses. For example, at the Nanaimo WWTP, weekly samples are taken for coliforms and enterococci. (90) Other WWTP are sometimes required under their permit to test for coliforms if they are discharging to a sensitive receiving environment. (90) Biological oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), fecal coliforms, turbidity and nitrogen amounts are the standard parameters used to measure effluent water.

Municipal sewers with primary or no treatment accounted for 18%, and another 13% used househol d septic systems. (91). By comparison, in 20 09 in BC, over 40% of the population was served by a WWTP with primary or no treatment, while 10% of residents did not have even basic wastewater treatment services. (92) This is in contrast to Ontario a nd Manitoba, where over 95% of services are secondary -mechanical treatment, and Alberta, where 78% of the population is on tertiary -level wastewater treatment. (92) Figure 6. Percentage of the Canadian population served by different levels of municipal wastewater treatment between 1983 and 2009 .(93) Environmental Health Services, BCCDC Page 35 of 64 In coastal areas of BC, there are at lea st 93 WWTPs operating that may impact marine waters as of May 2017 (Table 7). Of these, 81% use primary (7), secondary (66) or tertiary (2) treatment, while 18 (19%) do not treat wastewater before discharging into water bodies. Twenty other communities and areas along coastal BC exclusively use septic tank systems connected to outfalls that discharge to marine environments. Table 7.

Norovirus in water is typically reported in log 10 genome copies per liter of water, abbreviated as log 10 gc/L (Table 8 ). For example, if 1 liter of water contained 1000 genome copies, a 1 log 10 reduction would reduce the number of genome copies by 90% to 100, and a 2 log 10 reduction would reduce the number of copies by 99% to 10. Quantity of norovirus found in influent (raw sewage). Two recent meta -analyses (94, 95) and a mini review (96) examined the fate of norovirus in wastewater and its impact on shellfish contamination. WWTPs influent can be assumed to contain norovirus. In general, norovirus GII is detected at higher levels than nor ovirus GI. (94, 95) Environmental Health Services, BCCDC Page 36 of 64 There is also high variability in the number of genome copies per liter of influent, and these also vary by WWTP. Modelling in a North American meta -analysis by Pouillot et al., 2015 found WWTP influent concentrations of 31 gc/L for norovirus GI [1.5 log 10 gc/L; 95 % CI 0.4 to 2.4 log 10 gc/L], and 7943 gc/L for norovirus GII 3.5 to 4.3 log10 gcL). (95) However, other studies have found much higher levels. In Sweden, average levels of norovirus GI were 6.2 log 10 gc/L and GII 6.8 log 10 gc/L (97); in the UK, norovirus GI was 2.7 log 10 gc/L and norovirus GII 3.6 log 10 gc/L (98); and in the most recent global meta -analysis by Eftim et al., 2017, norovirus GII was 4.9 log10 gc/L (94). Norovirus quantities found in different regions of the world, found seasonally (pooled from all regions), are shown below in Figure 7 from this reference. (94) Figure 7. Norovirus densities in raw sewage. Boxplots represent a) different geographical regions; c) region and genogroup; pooled data from all regions is shown for b) sampling season; and d) season and genogroup (diagram from Eftim et al., 2017) (94). One study found viral concentrations in influent to be independent of community size, although more variability in quantities of norovirus and other viruses were found in smaller communities. Similar norovirus concentrati ons Environmental Health Services, BCCDC Page 37 of 64 between influent and effluent (between 2 and 5 log 10 gc/L) were found. (99) Higher concentrations of norovirus are found seasonally in the colder winter months in the northern hemisphere. (94, 97, 100) WWTP removal of norovirus. The effectiveness of wastewater treatment processes in removing norovirus is highly variable (95) and can be influenced by the amount of water entering the system, the amount of norovirus in the influent and the type of wastewater treatment. (98) For example, during rainfall events, wastewater moves at a greater velocity than normal through WWTPs, so it spends less time undergoing treatment. (95) While at least one study found levels of norovirus in both the influent and effluent similar (99), the meta -analysis found WWTP with mechanical systems and chlorine disinfection had higher overall log reductions in viral load than WWTP with lagoon systems and chlorine disinfection. (95) A Swedish study found norovirus reductions was low in several WWTPs, between 0. 4 and 1.0 log10 gc/L, although the WWTPs were not described. (97) A newly commissioned WWTP in Ireland with secondary treatment and UV disinfection similarly found low overall removal. Norovirus levels were reduced by 0.25 to 0.41 log 10 gc/100mL in effluent discharging to a shellfish growing area. (76) A secondary treatment WWTP with activated sludge and chlorination in New Orleans, Louisiana also reported a <1.0 l og10 removal of norovirus GI, which was lower than the removal of norovirus GII (1.4 log 10).(101) During storm conditions (estimated at >10mm rainfall per 24 hours) (36) storm and wastewater can bypass wastewater treatment in two ways. Firstly, it may be released through CSOs distributed at various points along the sewer pipe network without ever reaching a WWTP. Secondly, it may reach the WWTP but be channeled into overflow tanks or pipes and released into water bodies without treatment (treatment byp ass). Both types of overflow have been shown to increase the level of norovirus in effluent and shellfish. (10, 96, 102) Typically, the infection risk downstream of WWTPs is considered to be higher th an downstream of CSOs largely due to dilution effects (71). Nonetheless, average levels of norovirus in the proximity of CSO outfalls can increase up to 10 times during wet weather. (71) Shellfish collected near discharging CSO outfalls may contain average norovirus levels of 1000 PCR uni ts/g oyster tissue. (96) Even without overflow events, higher water flow through WWTPs decreases waste water transit time, thus treatment may be Environmental Health Services, BCCDC Page 38 of 64 less effective in removing norovi rus. Of significance to vulnerable shellfish growing areas, one study found the levels of norovirus in settled storm tank wastewater was equivalent to loading from raw influent waters. (103) Norovirus research in Canada A Canadian study examined removal of norovirus and other viruses through various waste -water treatment processes (primary sedimentation, secondary treatment, UV disinfection, membrane ultrafiltration, chlorination) at a large WWTP in Edmonton, Alberta. (104) Typical levels of norovirus (5\u00b785 \u00b1 1\u00b705 log 10 gc/L) in 16 influent samples were observed. (95) Removal of viral DNA, including norovirus, detectable by PCR, was much greater after membrane ultra filtration compared to using UV disinfection (Figure 5). Culture of viruses other than norovirus demonstrated a 30% decrease in viral infectivity during UV treatment. Figure 8. Norovirus research in an Edmonton WWTP (top) Treatment stages. (bottom) Virus log removal following municipal wastewater treatment by UV (black) and ultrafiltration (white) treatment trains. Bars represent means \u00b1 standard deviation (from Qiu et. al., 20 15 (104) ). Environmental Health Services, BCCDC Page 39 of 64 Norovirus research e lsewhere In a study of five WWTPs in the UK, primary treatment using settlement tanks resulted in an average 1 lo g10 reduction in norovirus, with secondary treatment providing a further 1.5 log10 reduction. Reductions were highly variable, ranging from a 6.1 log 10 reduction in GI to a 6.5 log 10 reduction for GII when using secondary treatment. (98) Secondary treatment using activated sludge (modified Ludzack -Ettinger) was most effective in removing norovirus, followed by trickling filters, biological aerat ed filters, and humus tanks. (98) Similarly, following one year of measurement at a single WWTP, a Swedish study found slight reductions from incoming water (1.5log 10) to primary settling (0.9 log 10) to secondary settling (0.4log 10) to trickling filter treatment (0.1log 10) through -out treatment. (105) For plants where secondary treatment was partially effective in reducing norovirus, UV treatment and to a lesser extent chlorine treatment, further reduced norovirus levels, but this reduction was dependent upon UV intensity or chlorine concentration. (66, 86) Membrane bioreactor was found to be more effective than conventional secondary treatments in removal of norovirus GI (median 3.02 log 10 gc/L over 1.43 log 10 gc/L) (86). Foam separation resulted in an 8 -fold reduction of norovirus in wastewater in one report. (106) Overall, tertiary UV exposure is considered the most effective method of inactivating viruses, although the Alberta study found membrane ultrafiltration removed higher viral loads than UV treatment. (95, 98, 104) However, UV impact is reduced in the presence of suspende d solids, requiring optimization of primary and secondary treatments to increase overall effectiveness. (107) Very few studies have compared the efficacy of norovirus removal from effluent between different types of WWTP designs. Study results are summarized in Table 9. Limitations Although PCR tests detect and quantify viral RNA from norovirus (genome copies), it is unknown whether the genetic material is from intact viruses capable of causing human illness, or from non -infective particles. Because of this limitation, there has been interest in using cultivable indicator viruses to more accurately measure removal of Environmental Health Services, BCCDC Page 40 of 64 infectious viral particles during WWT processes. The virus used most often as an indicator for norovirus is male -specific coliphage (also called F -specific coliphage, MSC). MSC is a virus whose natural hosts are coliform bacteria that grow in warm environments (i.e., the mammalian intestinal tract) therefore MSC are found in association with mammalian fecal material. MSC are ubiquitous in wastewater, are RNA viruses similar in size and s hape to noroviruses, and can be grown in bacterial cell cultures with a short turn -around time (one day or less). Studies using MSC virus have shown that PCR testing underestimates the reduction in infectious particles, and therefore can underestimate the effectiveness of treatment processes including lagoons, UV, and chlorine (76, 95, 99) . Dispersal and persistence of norovirus There is limited research describing h ow norovirus particles disperse and persist after discharge of effluent into ocean environments. Norovirus accumulation in mussels follows a tidally -driven effluent dispersal model, which differs in spatial pattern to E. coli .(108) In this study, mussels hung in cages around sewage discharge areas showed that while the dispersion did match MIKE21 (model) predictions, coliform and E.coli dispersions did not reflect viral dispersions in marine waters. (108) There appears to be a gradient o f norovirus in oysters corresponding to distance from a sewage outflow. In one study in New Zealand, total norovirus levels adjacent to the outfall were about 1,000 PCR units/g oyster, decreasing to 130 PCR units/g at 10 km and 100 PCR units/g at 24 km from the outfall. (96) In another study in Ireland, depending on the local hydrodynamic conditions, the extent of impacted area could be in excess of 4 km from the implicated discharge point. (96) Norovirus GII was found as far as 5.74 km from a discharge point, close to the Food and Drug Administration dilution level of 1,000:1. At one station measured, MSC find ings were above the ISSC critical limit of 50 pfu/100 g with positive norovirus findings. At this site a dilution level of 556:1 or less was insufficient to prevent norovirus contamination of oysters. (109) A study assessi ng norovirus and E.coli levels in oysters placed in proximity to WWTPs found decay rates for norovirus to be lower than those for E.coli; norovirus was detected up to 12.3 km away from the WWTP outfall (a geometric mean of 3 log10 gc/gram was found in Environmental Health Services, BCCDC Page 41 of 64 oysters). (12) Poorly treated sewage may result in norovirus contamination in shellfish up to 10km or more f rom a WWTP or sewage discharge site. (12) Norovirus has been reported to persist in oysters for 4 to 6 week s after a point in time sewage contamination event. (96) Oysters exposed to one large sewage spill and those exposed to smaller, repeated sewage events have been reported to accumula te similar amounts of norovirus (42). Conclusion Norovirus is not completely eliminated using best -available WWTP practices in optimally operating systems. Older technology, treatment plant malfunctions, and high rainfall events further increase the amount of norovirus entering the marine environment via wastewater DISTANCES TRAVELLED BY NOROVIRUS There are relatively few studies that attempted to measure the distance norovirus can travel. The work done to date has measured norovirus in shellfish indicators (oysters or mussels) at various distances from sewage contamination sites. In most studies, shellfish were not located far enough away from the outfalls and the actual outer limit or boundary zone where norovirus might be found was not established. In one study, the same amounts of norovirus were detected in an outfall as in the oysters located over 7km downstream from the WWTP outfall. By 10km distance from the outfall, norovirus had decreased by only 0.6 log 10 in the sam pled oysters (12). After a raw sewage overflow during a heavy rain event, where more than 3000 kL of raw se wage was discharged into the coastal environment in New Zealand, norovirus GII was detected in oysters 8.5km distance from the outfall point (12). Various studies are cited which observed that norovirus in the marine environment can be transported greater than 10 km from the discharge point (110) . A gradient of norovirus was observed in New Zealand shellfish corresponding to distan ce from an outfall. At the point of the outfall 1000 PCR units/g were detected in shellfish; at 10 km away, 130 PCR units/g, and at 24 km away 100 PCR units/g (G. Greening).

Environmental Health Services, BCCDC Page 43 of 64 Appendix 1. Glossary of terms (111) Term Description Activated Sludge Sludge that has undergone flocculation forming a bacterial culture typically carried out in tanks. Can be extended with aeration. Advanced Primary Treatment The use of special additives to raw wastewater to cause flocculation or clumping to help settlin g before the primary treatment such as screening. Advanced Wastewater Treatment Any advanced process used above and beyond the defacto typical minimum primary and secondary wastewater treatment. Clarifier A piece of wastewater treatment equipment used to \"clarify\" the wastewater, usually some sort of holding tank that allows settling. Used when solids have a specific gravity greater than 1. Combined Sewer A system where the storm drains and sewer drains are combined. The advantage to this is storm water, which can contain contaminants, gets treated. Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) When the amount of liquid entering into a combined sewer overwhelms the system and causes and overflow. Generally resulting in a discharge of unprocessed liquids Digestion The breaking down of sludge and other waste biologically by microorganisms. Results in byproducts such as methane gas, carbon dioxide, sludge solids and water. Aerobic digestion requires oxygen, anaerobic digestion the absence of oxygen. Disinfection The use of chemicals to kill any disease causing organisms in the polished wastewater. UV light can also be used. Effluent Liquids existing a wastewater treatment plant in a treated or untreated state. Flocculation The process whereby a chemical or other substa nce is added to wastewater to trap or attract the particulate suspended solids into clusters or clumps of floc or flocculent, wooly looking masses. Influent Liquids entering into a wastewater treatment plant, basin or reservoir. These can include grey wat er, black water and storm water runoff. Primary Wastewater Treatment The first process usually associated with municipal wastewater treatment to remove the large inorganic solids and settle out sand and grit. Retention time/Residence time The average amount of time wastewater spends at the wastewater treatment plant. This time can vary greatly due to the types of systems and plants, from minutes to weeks. Secondary Wastewater Treatment Second biological process of digestion with bacteria. Environmental Health Services, BCCDC Page 44 of 64 Sludge/bios olid The solid waste that settles to the bottom of the wastewater treatment process. Sludge can be dewatered and reused or disposed of. Strom Water Run - Off (SRO) The pulse of surface water following a rainstorm. The water carries sediment, gas, oil, anim al feces, glass and other waste from the watershed to receiving waters creating a difficult urban/suburban wastewater problem. Tertiary Wastewater Treatment (Advanced) Biological or chemical polishing of wastewater to remove organics, solids and nutrients . Tertiary wastewater effluent limits are generally 10 mg/1 BOD5 and 10 mg/1 TSS. Tertiary Treatment The use of filtration to remove microscopic particles from wastewater that has already been treated to a Secondary Level. Ultraviolet Disinfection The use of ultraviolet light to kills bacteria and other microorganisms in water and wastewater. Typically a final treatment step. Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) A WWTP is designed to treat wastewater from sewer and/or storm water pipes in order to reduce harmful materials.
