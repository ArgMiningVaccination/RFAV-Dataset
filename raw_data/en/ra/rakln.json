We offer the following services to keep your Acupuncture is when a set of needles is inserted into parts of the animal to promote healing. Each acupuncture point has a specific goal. This technique has been used in various veterinary practices for thousands of years and will treat any ailment. Although acupuncture will not cure every condition, it will work extremely well when there is an issue. Small dogs and large dogs will actually respond to acupuncture differently. Small dogs will typically come and receive acupuncture because of musculoskeletal problems such as arthritis, intervertebral disk disease, or traumatic nerve injury. They also come in for skin problems such as lick granulomas and allergic dermatitis. Acupuncture can assist in healing all of these problems. Advanced Digital X-rays At Family Pet Health Care in Decatur, AL , we are proud to be on the cutting edge of medical technology. Radiology is a technique and diagnostic tool that we use to look inside the body in an entirely non-invasive way. X-rays allow us to create images of all the body's organs. In other words, the use of radiology gives us a view of the internal organs in your pets' body that we otherwise could not see. It is a valuable diagnostic tool that helps veterinarians detect and prevent illness. Allergy Testing Dogs and cats can be allergic to almost anything, similar to allergies in people. Pets can be allergic to allergens in their household environment, outside environment, or even their food. Symptoms can range from itchiness and ear or eye infections to constant licking, and even vomiting or diarrhea. Many pets suffer from allergies which can directly affect their quality of life, as well as their owner's. Boarding While your pets are with us, we will do everything we can to give them an exciting visit. If you are concerned about leaving your pet, please don't hesitate to set up a time to visit our hospital and look around our boarding facility. We will be happy to discuss our boarding policies and answer any questions you may have. [Boarding Agreement](/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Boarding-Agreement2023.pdf) [Boarding Newsletter](/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Boarding-Newsletter.pdf) C-Section We are highly skilled when it comes to c-sections for breeds such as English Bulldogs, Frenchies and Pugs. These breeds have large heads that can become stuck in the mother's birth canal. Over 80% of bulldog litters are delivered by c-section, and because of their body type certain breeds will typically need a c-section to give birth, or whelp. That's why we are proud to have expert surgeons who are knowledgeable and experienced when it comes to performing c-sections on these breeds. As a pet owner you want the best for your pet, and that is what our surgeons provide. Dental Care Dental care is vital to the overall health of any pet. Dental disease can lead to health issues with the heart, liver, and kidneys and has the potential to seep into your pet's bloodstream. In fact, 80 percent of dogs and 70 percent of cats over three years of age suffer from some form of dental disease, making it the most common pet health issue among our pet population. Dermatology Your pets' skin is the largest organ of the body. Allergies, parasites, infections, autoimmune diseases and cancers can all affect your pet's skin. We offer specific diagnostic tests like allergy testing, fungal testing, cultures and biopsies, along with the most cutting edge treatments to ensure the health of your pets' skin. Geriatric Care Preventative medicine is important when our pets are young, but as our pets age, and become prone to certain disease processes, annual exams and blood work becomes even more critical. Annual exams and blood work to check liver and kidney values, along with thyroid function have the potential to alert us to early changes that may give us valuable information about your pet's health. We understand the changes your pet will have as they become older, and we also know the importance of keeping your pet healthy as they enter their golden years.

Health Certificates If you want to travel internationally with your pet, you need to plan ahead. Since each country is different, you will have to contact the embassy or consulate where you are going to find out what you need to do. Though every country has different requirements, most require a health certificate that is done by a USDA-accredited veterinarian. Luckily, we have a USDA-accredited veterinarian. If you are not a client, you need to make sure you bring your pets' records in with you to the examination. You will always need a health certificate and proof of vaccination. You may also need a microchip and blood tests. Many countries require that your pet get treated for parasites prior to travel. You may also need certificates for the airplane ride. Since each country is different and we can't stay up to date will all of the changes in each one, it is important that you call ahead and know what you need. Then, we will make sure that your pet is all ready to go! [read more](#) Hospice and Euthanasia Saying goodbye to your pet can be extremely difficult.

But every pet owner is inevitably faced with making that tough decision, and we want to be there alongside you to aid in any way we can. If you have special requests, please let us know and we will be sure to accommodate them.

The best part of being able to run laboratory tests in our hospital is that we can diagnose your pets much sooner than if we had to send the blood work out to another laboratory. Whenever your pets are not feeling well, we can offer you results and a diagnosis in minutes instead of making you wait a day (or more) for the results. Laser Therapy We are proud to announce we are now offering laser therapy, an innovative new way to treat pain and inflammation in pets. Laser therapy uses specific wavelengths of light to create therapeutic effects such as improved healing time, pain reduction, increased circulation and decreased swelling.

Every year, thousands and thousands of pets go missing. Not knowing where your pet is or how to bring them back can be a helpless, hopeless feeling. It's a tragedy that happens all too often.

Obesity is a common problem among pets, as it can be easy to overfeed a cute dog or cat that knows how to beg. Being overweight is a serious problem for animals, and can cause real health problems. With proper diet and exercise, all pets should be able to meet their dietary needs and stay within a healthy weight range. Parasite Prevention The idea of your pet being infested with parasites is a disturbing thought, but it's also a medical issue that can have serious consequences if not properly dealt with or prevented. Parasites pose a variety of health issues for our pets, who can be very susceptible to certain parasites depending on age, region, and other factors. At Family Pet Health Care, we emphasize the importance of preventing parasites. Through preventative measures, you can successfully protect your pet. Pets that are not protected often develop parasites, leading to serious problems for them and their owners. Pain Management Pets that are in pain are miserable. For this reason, we will do whatever we can to keep your pets comfortable. We have many different choices when it comes to treating apets' pain. There are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which are very helpful with mild pain. We also prescribe steroids which can offer a lot of relief. We also have stronger pain medications if the non-steroidal medications are not enough. We also offer glucosamine in tablets and injections to help with arthritis. Pharmacy It is our goal to provide you with complete veterinary care in a professional and accessible atmosphere. That is why we offer a fully stocked pharmacy to fill your pets' prescription needs. Having an on-site pharmacy provides you with a more convenient way to get your pets' medication. We hope that this will save you time and ultimately enhance your experience with us. Preventative Care We believe the best way to promote overall health is through preventative care. Regular checkups allow us to establish a baseline in your pets' health and make us aware of any changes that may indicate future problems. We highly recommend bringing your pet in for regular exams. Often health problems that go undetected can become more severe issues when left untreated, so checkups are important even when your pet appears healthy. Puppy and Kitten Care Getting a new puppy or kitten is very exciting. You have a lot to look forward to. The great companionship that a good pet can bring is very rewarding. However, puppies and kittens come with a lot of responsibility and work. Here at Family Pet Health Care, we are here to help you with your new addition.
