Using the in-depth principles of Ayurveda, a 5,000-year-old tradition of holistic medicine, she has had outstanding results for all health problems. Each patient receives individual attention in a small private setting. She is highly skilled using pulse diagnosis to understand the deepest level of imbalance in the body. The United States unfortunately does not have an ancient tradition of healing. The field of holistic medicine in the US is still in its infancy, and sadly many mistakes are being made in the treatment of patients, especially with diet, daily routine and detoxification. We treat just about everything that presents to our office. We have had success treating cases of Multiple Sclerosis, Autism (including the entire autistic spectrum), ADD, ADHD, infertility, gall bladder problems, chronic yeast infections, parasitic infections, recurring bladder and sinus infections, chronic bronchitis and pneumonia, asthma, reactive airway disease, allergies (both airborne and food allergies), pregnancy and lactation, headaches and migraines, diabetes and prediabetes, musculoskeletal and spinal problems, thyroid gland problems, autoimmune diseases and a whole host of other diseases.
