Aromatherapy is a clinical method of applying essential oils along the energy meridians and visceral contact points on the back and feet to help stimulate and balance the body physically, emotionally and spiritually. Each essential oil is personally selected using advanced biofeedback software. During a session you will lay draped with a sheet and blanket on a massage table. The therapist will only need access to your back and feet. Hot towels are applied, and then warm oil is gently massaged onto your back and feet. Next, hot stones are used to stimulate the reflexes, open the pores, and relax the muscles. One at a time your personally selected essential oils will be gently massaged onto your back and feet. After each application you are encouraged to breathe deeply to inhale the essential oil and receive the benefits of aromatherapy. When your session is finished another application of hot stones and hot towels are applied to encourage deeper relaxation. Come in comfortable clothing ready to relax!

The human foot has as many as 7,000 sensory nerve endings which are connected to the body's internal organs. Thai reflexology works on the belief that certain zones of the foot correspond to these organs. It focuses on the reflex areas in these zones to bring a range of health benefits including: better sleep, relaxation, positive mood and increased circulation. Though Thai Reflexology is centuries old, the ReSet appointment also combines modern technology with the technique for enhanced benefits. At the beginning of your session a transdermal scanner is used to help target areas of need for the application of the reflexology. When you finish your appointment you will be given a map of the feet with areas you can self-massage at home. | | Aromatherapy Massage | | $95 for one or buy 3 sessions for $240 | | Initial Naturopathic Wellness Consultation | | $210 | | Follow-Up Wellness Consultation | | $90 | | Detox Foot Bath | | $35 additional $15 to add-on Braintapping | | Thai Reflexology | | $95 | | 30 Minute Kloud Session | | $42 | | Kloud mat rental, including instruction and personalized protocols for the person renting and family members. | | $150 per week "}
