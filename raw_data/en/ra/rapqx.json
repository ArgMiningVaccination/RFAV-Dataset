Introduction Basis of Ayurveda Therapy With an uninterrupted, unbroken tradition of more than 5,000 years, ayurveda is probably the oldest healing tradition known to humankind that has not only survived for such a long time but is still practiced in its original form. Its focus on self-care habits, conscious lifestyle, immunity, longevity, mental health, and holistic management of diseases have a universal appeal. The ayurvedic way of life seeks to enhance wellness through greater self-awareness, right diet and lifestyle habits, a union of body and mind (yoga), and the use of preventive herbs. Healing in ayurveda is more about prevention and health promotion rather than remedial action. And when prevention fails, remedial action takes a holistic view of things, and not just focuses on curing the disease but also tries to prevent it from coming back. Works on the Underlying Cause Unlike mainstream medicine, healing in ayurveda is not all about treating symptoms. Its goal is to address the underlying cause of diseases early on. Ayurveda views all kinds of diseases as some form of dosha imbalance. Treating the symptoms of one disease may not help because aggravated dosha may again manifest as some other disorder in the near future. Therefore, unless the dosha imbalance is corrected, an individual is still at risk. Diseases are viewed as an effect, not a cause. Ayurvedic medicines target this cause to prevent future occurrence of related diseases. More than Medicines Ayurvedic therapies do not solely rely on medicines. Along with medications, ayurvedic therapies include diet, yoga, lifestyle changes, as well as some preventive herbs to enhance immunity against similar kinds of diseases. Even after the course of medicine has ended, further lifestyle changes are suggested to sustain its benefits for the longer term. Basis of Yoga Therapy Stress is an outcome of today's lifestyle. It is produced out of wrong diet, fear, frustration, and dejection. At present, human existence is challenged by mental disorders or psychosomatic diseases such as dementia, hypertension, heart diseases, diabetes, asthma, etc. Although the ancient practice of yoga is not developed for the purpose of therapy, it has been observed through the continuous study that the regular practice of yoga not only controls these diseases but also prevents the developments of many diseases in our body. Though yoga is not an alternative therapy to modern medicine, it definitely supports the healing process. Today, yoga practice is popular mostly because of its therapeutic value. Nowadays, the practitioner of yoga looks upon the care of his body as a primary duty. Yoga is undoubtedly the most effective and best suited to the demands of modern life. Yoga practice is a blessing for mankind, by means of its asanas, which give suppleness to the spine\u2014our life axis, by stimulating and calming nerves, and by relaxing muscles. Pranayama (the breathing regulation techniques) brings oxygen or prana to each and every cell and helps to burn waste products and expels the toxins from our body. Yoga has the potential to reduce stress and balance the mind, which is the key to the management of diseases. Therapeutic yoga is a holistic approach and works on the body, mind, and spirit simultaneously. The ancient techniques systematically strengthen each part of the body like the brain, heart, lungs, muscles, nerves, skin, and hair. Yoga also helps the body more efficiently to remove toxins or waste products, which are the main source of developing diseases. The regular practice of yoga can bring physical and physiological changes. Hatha yoga says no two people are alike and have different strengths and weaknesses. So it's better to practice under the supervision of an expert therapist or guru to obtain the best out of it. Yoga is a slow medicine, but it is the best remedy for an uncountable number of diseases. Yoga therapy is a self-empowering process. The practitioner needs to adopt an incremental approach rather than aggressive strategies, which is more effective and key to success. Chapter 1 How Ayurveda Therapy and Yoga Therapy Work Together and Contribute to Healing All the Five Layers of a Being Ayurveda or ayurvedic medicine is the most ancient system of traditional medicine, which is native to India, that uses a various range of treatments, such as panchakarma ( five actions), specified herbal diet and herbal medicine, to treat physical, mental, and spiritual health problems in order to bring health and well-being. Panchakarma is a fivefold detoxification treatment involving massage, herbal therapy, and other procedures. According to ayurveda and yoga, our body is composed of five elements of pancha bhootas (pancha = five, bhoothas = elements). These five elements are agni (fire), vayu (air), akasha (ether), bhoomi (earth), and jala (water). These elements in different combinations characterize three types of doshas or bodily humors that make up one's constitution. These three doshas are vata (air + ether), pitta (fire + water), and kapha (earth + water). These doshas become imbalanced due to diet, lifestyle, stress, etc. Whenever any of the five elements increases due to the change in dietary habits or lifestyle, it imbalances all doshas. Hence, ayurveda therapy mainly focuses on the mind/body system and the balancing of the doshas. By changing or pacifying the imbalance of these doshas, ayurveda treats a person for both physical and mental illnesses. Ayurveda in this way balances the physical, mental, and spiritual health of a person. Yoga therapy on the other hand is mainly shat kriyas (six cleansings) or six detoxification procedures, which are essentially part of hatha yoga practice as described in the Upanishads (of Vedas). Shat kriyas consists of six groups of purification techniques. The main purpose of the practice is to balance the flow of two major nadi or pranic flows, ida and pingala, thereby attaining physical and mental purification and balance. Other than the shat kriyas, one can use all other yoga practices like yama and niyama (the moral and ethical practices), yogasana, pranayama, and meditation for healing various types of physical, mental, and spiritual health issues. The shat kriyas are classified as: Trataka Concentrated gazing for eye cleansing to purify the ocular system and also to cleanse the nadi system associated with "}
