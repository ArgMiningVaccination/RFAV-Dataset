[2](#B2-jkms-38-e43)Approximately one-quarter of the world's population is estimated to have latent TB infection (LTBI). [3](#B3-jkms-38-e43)Its treatment is a critical component of the World Health Organization (WHO)'s End TB Strategy. [4](#B4-jkms-38-e43)The current COVID-19 pandemic is imposing unprecedented impact to the health systems, with adverse effect being reported on TB services and outcomes. [2](#B2-jkms-38-e43)In the current public health emergency during which health resources are limited, TB health services is delayed due to reallocation of resources into the COVID-19 response measures. TB preventive services is the first to be suspended based on the assumption that it was less of a priority compared to treatment services. This is an alarming situation as many studies project that such decline in TB case detection and prevention will eventually lead to increased TB mortality in the near future, reversing years of global progress and efforts in the fight against TB. [2](#B2-jkms-38-e43) [5](#B5-jkms-38-e43)Numerous studies have assessed the impact of COVID-19 on individual TB preventive measures, such as Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), LTBI management, TB surveillance, and early detection activities such as contact tracing and case finding. However, there are currently a limited number of studies that analyzed the impact of the pandemic on a full spectrum of TB preventive services in aim to develop sets of policy recommendations recovery strategies. In this regard, this study aims to review the literature on the impact of COVID-19 on TB preventive services. Then, we discussed their recovery strategies and policy options for more effective management of TB in both the pandemic and post-COVID public health landscape. METHODS [6](#B6-jkms-38-e43)We further elaborate on other methods of the study below. The detailed methods of a rapid review and search protocol are also provided in the [Supplementary Data 1](#S1-jkms-38-e43). Ethical approval was not required for this study as this was a review of existing studies. Search strategy [7](#B7-jkms-38-e43)The question was structured to search literature in the setting of any national, local, and or global settings (S), in the perspectives of policy makers and/or service providers (P), on how the phenomenon of COVID-19 pandemic (I) compared with pre-pandemic (C) impacted the preventive services (E), which include BCG vaccination, LTBI management, TB surveillance, screening, case finding, and contact tracing. [8](#B8-jkms-38-e43)was referred to internally. All initial searches were conducted by one of the authors (YJ) in May-June 2022. Screening and study selection [Fig. 1](#F1-jkms-38-e43)). The first and last articles retrieved were published in February 2020 and June 2022, respectively. A total of 95 articles were duplicates included in both the MEDLINE and EMBASE database and 4 articles were duplicates identified otherwise. After removing duplicates, a total of 122 articles were left for initial screening. Two authors (YJ and JM) conducted an independent screening of all titles and abstracts. Our inclusion criteria were that studies must assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on TB on at least one of the following TB prevention-related services: 1) BCG or vaccination against TB, 2) detection and treatment of LTBI, 3) TB screening and diagnostics, 4) TB active case finding and/or contact tracing, and 5) TB surveillance. Studies that aimed to solely evaluate a clinical aspect of COVID-19 and TB (e.g., COVID-19 and TB co-infection, susceptibility of COVID-19 in TB patients) were excluded. We also excluded articles that explored the interrelationship of COVID-19, TB, and a third independent factor and also articles that addressed the currently unvindicated hypothesis of the protective effect of BCG against COVID-19. The review process sorted out 26 articles which were not fit for the criteria, which were reviewed once again by one of the authors before final exclusion. A total of 96 articles went under independent, full-text screening by both authors, to evaluate whether they still met the inclusion criteria. After the full-text screening, a total of 93 articles were selected for our review. Complete author agreement of article selection was achieved. No automation tools were used in the process. As articles may have explored the impact of COVID-19 on more than one type of TB service, the numbers may have duplicates and add up to more than the total number of reviewed articles. Data extraction [Supplementary Table 1](#S2-jkms-38-e43)). In the case where the estimate of effect was not quantitative, as in many qualitative studies reviewed, descriptive estimate of effect was collected. The decision on which data is to be extracted was informed by the Checklist of items to consider in data collection or data extraction from the Cochrane Handbook. The extracted data also included all the elements of the research question of this study formulated through the SPICE framework. Data extraction was conducted by a single reviewer (YJ) with verification of a random subset 31 (33.3%) of the results by the second reviewer (JM). Knowledge synthesis [4](#B4-jkms-38-e43)as an a priori framework on TB management. The WHO End TB strategy suggests three pillars as essential components of effective TB management, which are 1) TB care and prevention, 2) policies and support programs, and 3) research and innovation. These \"pillars\" were used as primary themes in the descriptive theme building process. After completion of the descriptive theme building based on the 30 selected articles, the authors went under an iterative process of final theme building. The authors agreed that the three pillars of the WHO End TB strategy respectively encompassed elements that could broadly be considered as preventive measures. Therefore, these preventive measures were selected from the pillars to build final analytical categories, which is as follows: 1) vaccination against TB, 2) detection and treatment of LTBI, 3) TB screening and diagnostics, 4) TB active case finding and/or contact tracing, and 5) TB surveillance. These categories were further worked up to be classified as codes specifying a more detailed programs and activities pertaining to respective categories. Five categories were also grouped into two themes, namely \"preventive services\" and \"surveillance and early detection\" ( [Fig. 2](#F2-jkms-38-e43)). This final TB prevention thematic framework, developed by the authors, was then applied in the knowledge synthesis of all articles, including the 30 initial articles selected during the theme building process. We analyzed each article to synthesize 1) the impact of COVID-19 on TB preventive services (e.g., changes and/or disruptions in service delivery, coverage, obstacles, and barriers, etc.) and 2) policy recommendation and implications. RESULTS [Table 1](#T1-jkms-38-e43). Proportions of original articles increased from 12.9% in 2020 to 29.0% in 2022. TB surveillance (73.2%) was the most common category, followed by the LTBI management (19.4%). In [Tables 2](#T2-jkms-38-e43)and [3](#T3-jkms-38-e43), we present the summary of knowledge synthesis on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on TB services, possible causes, and relevant policy implications. Table 1 Table 2 Table 3 BCG vaccination [9](#B9-jkms-38-e43)while articles from individual countries reported a drop in coverage that ranged from 7% to 60%. [10](#B10-jkms-38-e43) [11](#B11-jkms-38-e43) [12](#B12-jkms-38-e43) [13](#B13-jkms-38-e43) [14](#B14-jkms-38-e43)In Pakistan, the BCG vaccine was the vaccination that showed the highest decline (40.6%) among routine vaccination. [11](#B11-jkms-38-e43)In one modeling study, the COVID-19-disrupted BCG vaccination coverage was estimated to be a global decline of 25%, with an additional 33,000 TB deaths in children. [15](#B15-jkms-38-e43)Studies identified healthcare service disruption and movement restrictions regarding COVID-19 responses as the main cause of such decrease in BCG coverage; disruption of immunization services, reduced TB healthcare seeking behavior, fear of COVID-19 infection, movement restrictions, reduction in vaccine shipments due to border closures and air freight restrictions, and instability of the BCG vaccine in the production market. [10](#B10-jkms-38-e43) [11](#B11-jkms-38-e43) [12](#B12-jkms-38-e43) [14](#B14-jkms-38-e43) [15](#B15-jkms-38-e43)Studies generally agree on the concern that such decline in BCG coverage may lead to increased pediatric TB mortality, suggesting routine immunization programs, catch-up activities and/or periodic intensification of routine immunization services, [10](#B10-jkms-38-e43) [13](#B13-jkms-38-e43) [15](#B15-jkms-38-e43)promotion of safe immunization sessions, [11](#B11-jkms-38-e43)and securing of BCG supply for routine immunization. [16](#B16-jkms-38-e43) [17](#B17-jkms-38-e43) New TB vaccines [18](#B18-jkms-38-e43) [19](#B19-jkms-38-e43)While articles also mention that the intrinsic nature of Mycobacteria and the complexity of human immune response against it are additional factors of the relatively slow progress of vaccine development compared to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines, [13](#B13-jkms-38-e43) [19](#B19-jkms-38-e43)all articles agree that more funding and long-term commitment is needed. [13](#B13-jkms-38-e43) to delays in LTBI service or the lower priority of LTBI testing over detection of active TB and COVID-19. [21](#B21-jkms-38-e43) [22](#B22-jkms-38-e43)WHO reported that there was a 21% reduction in the number of people who were started on TB preventive treatment in 2020, which was a reversion of the positive trend that had been maintained until 2019. [2](#B2-jkms-38-e43)In a Canadian study, reductions in LTBI treatment initiation rate ranged from 30% to 66%, which showed a higher drop compared to active TB. [25](#B25-jkms-38-e43)On the other hand, there was one study where maintenance of TB health services resulted in minimal disruption of LTBI treatment and screening. [26](#B26-jkms-38-e43)On the other hand, articles revealed that there was an increase in the proportion of LTBI among TB contacts during the pandemic, which ranged from 5.9% to 14.3% difference. [27](#B27-jkms-38-e43) [28](#B28-jkms-38-e43)This trend was more prominent in children as observed through a much higher percentage of LTBI and active TB among children who were household contacts in 2020 compared to 2019 (57.7% vs. 5.3%) [29](#B29-jkms-38-e43)and less than 30% of TB preventive treatment rate among children under the age of 5 years. [2](#B2-jkms-38-e43) [30](#B30-jkms-38-e43) TB screening [2](#B2-jkms-38-e43)In single country studies, TB testing decreased by 50% from pre- to post-lockdown in South Africa [31](#B31-jkms-38-e43)and by 73% from March to April 2020 at a primary referral laboratory in UK. [32](#B32-jkms-38-e43)This TB diagnosis gap was greater in drug-resistant TB and pediatric TB patients. [33](#B33-jkms-38-e43) [34](#B34-jkms-38-e43)Such impact in TB testing was suggested to be due to numerous factors including diversion of resources to COVID-19 response, stigma preventing access to diagnostic services, and reduction in laboratory capacity and operations. [35](#B35-jkms-38-e43) [36](#B36-jkms-38-e43) [37](#B37-jkms-38-e43)In a study conducted on a network of 31 national TB reference laboratories in Europe, more than 56% of laboratories experienced \"very significant\" and \"significant\" disturbances in its operation in April 2020. [38](#B38-jkms-38-e43)Numerous countries have diverted GeneXpert for COVID-19 testing amidst the pandemic [35](#B35-jkms-38-e43) [39](#B39-jkms-38-e43)and this diversion of diagnostic resources is identified as a major cause of decline in TB testing capacities. [34](#B34-jkms-38-e43) [35](#B35-jkms-38-e43) [37](#B37-jkms-38-e43) [40](#B40-jkms-38-e43)However, in Korea with sound public-private partnership, coverage of smear, culture, and drug susceptibility tests among active pulmonary TB patients were not affected during the early phase of the pandemic. [41](#B41-jkms-38-e43)It is suggested that guaranteeing continuity of TB diagnostic services and leveraging TB laboratory capacity is necessary to ensure TB [31](#B31-jkms-38-e43) [44](#B44-jkms-38-e43)A single country study in Spain suggested that the limited operation of active case finding and contact tracing amidst COVID-19 might have led to increased transmission within households. [27](#B27-jkms-38-e43)TB contact tracing is recognized as a labor-intensive process and numerous studies suggested incorporating digital health technologies in its process to promote efficiency. [31](#B31-jkms-38-e43) [42](#B42-jkms-38-e43) [43](#B43-jkms-38-e43)Because infection prevention and control (IPC) of contact tracing and screening sessions was considered as a factor in suboptimal operation of TB detection activities, IPC training, supply of personal protect equipment, and awareness campaigns were also suggested. [42](#B42-jkms-38-e43) [43](#B43-jkms-38-e43) TB surveillance [2](#B2-jkms-38-e43)Compared to pre-pandemic period, TB case detection declined by 20-80% during the pandemic in Nigeria, Ghana, Ethiopia, Nepal, India, China, Pakistan, Brazil, Korea, Japan, and South TB cases coincided with national lock-down [59](#B59-jkms-38-e43)While in a few studies figures showed a rebound after such measures were lifted [29](#B29-jkms-38-e43) [57](#B57-jkms-38-e43)or once response measures were rolled-out, [60](#B60-jkms-38-e43)articles generally stated that such decline in case notification did not resume its pre-pandemic levels even after lockdowns were lifted. [49](#B49-jkms-38-e43) [61](#B61-jkms-38-e43)Studies from several countries showed relatively minimal disruption to the TB case notification figures, such as a 12% decline in Germany, [62](#B62-jkms-38-e43)8% decline in Vietnam, [63](#B63-jkms-38-e43)14.6% decline in a single district in Malaysia, [64](#B64-jkms-38-e43)and a decrease from an average of 4.7 cases to 4.1 cases per day in UK. [65](#B65-jkms-38-e43)A modeling study that reflects the current trend of TB case notification revealed that 25% decline in TB case notifications may lead to an additional 190,000 TB deaths. [66](#B66-jkms-38-e43)Other studies suggest that current disturbances in TB services may result in 201,595 additional TB deaths in China, India, and South Africa [67](#B67-jkms-38-e43)and 374,000 additional TB deaths in India, Kenya, and Ukraine. [68](#B68-jkms-38-e43)WHO reported an increase of more than 100,000 TB deaths in 2020 compared to 2019, which was the first transition into an increasing trend since 2005. [2](#B2-jkms-38-e43) DISCUSSION [13](#B13-jkms-38-e43)However, it is also well known that provision of routine immunization programs including BCG, and maybe especially the BCG, are vulnerable in public health disaster situations. During the 2014-2016 Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa, BCG was the most prominent contributor to the total vaccine stock out, contributing 54% of the total facility-days of stock-outs in one study. [69](#B69-jkms-38-e43) [70](#B70-jkms-38-e43)Similar situation is ongoing with the current COVID-19 pandemic. [2](#B2-jkms-38-e43)With regards to IPC and immunization safety, immunization sessions and delivery modes should be strengthened to ensure IPC through provision of adequate personal protective equipment, separated immunization sessions, drive-through services, and public campaigns on the safety and necessity of continuing timely routine vaccination even during the pandemic. [11](#B11-jkms-38-e43) [15](#B15-jkms-38-e43)Benchmarking the global cooperation on the development and distribution of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, efforts should be made by states and relevant international partners to secure BCG stocks through political support and international cooperation. [16](#B16-jkms-38-e43) [17](#B17-jkms-38-e43)Immediate catch-up vaccination or periodic intensification of immunization services has been recommended in critically affected areas to recover coverage rates and minimize duration of delay. [10](#B10-jkms-38-e43) [13](#B13-jkms-38-e43) [16](#B16-jkms-38-e43) [17](#B17-jkms-38-e43) [71](#B71-jkms-38-e43)As it is beyond the scope of this study, this review did not assess articles that have explored this hypothesis. However, as of April 2020, WHO stated that there is no evidence that the BCG vaccination is protective against COVID-19 infection, and numerous articles have warned against unnecessary BCG administration that might disrupt routine immunization services amidst the pandemic. [18](#B18-jkms-38-e43) [19](#B19-jkms-38-e43)While BCG is the only currently available TB vaccine in use for a century, its efficacy in protection against pulmonary TB and TB re-infection in adults and adolescents is controversial, thereby putting demand on new TB vaccines. [13](#B13-jkms-38-e43) [18](#B18-jkms-38-e43)With several TB vaccine candidates in the pipeline, reviewed articles equally suggest that the experience of the global society in the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines should be applied in the development of TB vaccines, which include rapid multi-disciplinary and multi-national cooperation, successful public-private partnerships, experience with the vaccine platform, innovations in trial designs and endpoint selection, and fund sharing. [13](#B13-jkms-38-e43) [18](#B18-jkms-38-e43) [72](#B72-jkms-38-e43)Commercial-scale manufacturing should be discussed and tuned early in the clinical development process to ensure timely market distribution following efficacy trials. [27](#B27-jkms-38-e43) [28](#B28-jkms-38-e43) [29](#B29-jkms-38-e43)The combined effect of the lower BCG coverage rate and increased LTBI among children may lead to amplification in pediatric TB burden in the near future. It is suggested that TB health services remain functional and early detection activities be maintained even at a minimum level during emergencies. [21](#B21-jkms-38-e43) [22](#B22-jkms-38-e43) [25](#B25-jkms-38-e43) [27](#B27-jkms-38-e43)During the pandemic, established TB contact tracing mechanisms could be leveraged for COVID-19 contact tracing, vice versa. In post-pandemic situations, catch-up activities to identify missed cases, strengthening of household contact tracing in response to the increased LTBI, and enforcing LTBI in targeted population groups are necessary. [23](#B23-jkms-38-e43) [28](#B28-jkms-38-e43) [73](#B73-jkms-38-e43) [74](#B74-jkms-38-e43) [75](#B75-jkms-38-e43)At the same time, there are concerns surrounding the possibility of suboptimal diagnosis for both diseases in settings where laboratory capacity is weak. [35](#B35-jkms-38-e43) [37](#B37-jkms-38-e43)To minimize any negative impact on TB diagnosis and detection, capacity planning should be carefully conducted, including the details of supply chain management, specimen transport, operating procedures of specimen pooling, equipment maintenance, training and protection of human resources, monitoring of laboratory burden and strategies to deal with any overburden. [49](#B49-jkms-38-e43) [61](#B61-jkms-38-e43)The speculation regarding the cause of the drop in TB notification is a mixture of underreporting of TB cases and a true reduction in TB incidence. Underreporting of TB cases is one that should have been detected but went undetected due to a variety of possible causes, such as disruption of active case finding programs and surveillance systems, overload in laboratory capacity, mobility restrictions due to lockdowns, delay in healthcare seeking, and overlapping symptoms of incidence might be the effect of social distancing, lock-downs, strengthening of IPC in congregate settings, and mask use that may have generally decreased transmission of infectious diseases among susceptible individuals. [89](#B89-jkms-38-e43)In low-burden countries, decline in emigrants due to travel restrictions is also considered as a possible cause of decrease in incidence. Although there is no clear evidence on their attributable risk to the current trend in TB cases, the Stop TB Partnership assumed that physical distancing and consequent reduction in transmission may be attributable to about a 10% decrease in TB case notifications in high TB burden settings [78](#B78-jkms-38-e43)suggesting that the proportion of under-diagnosis is much greater than any decline in true incidence. [66](#B66-jkms-38-e43) [67](#B67-jkms-38-e43) [68](#B68-jkms-38-e43)So, what should be done to mitigate this detrimental impact of COVID-19 on TB? Reviewed articles suggest a common set of interventions that should rapidly and sustainably be conducted, which include: maintaining and leveraging TB detection services (e.g. contact tracing, screening, laboratory services), support the provision of TB preventive treatment services with TB/COVID-19 detection, incorporating digital technologies in TB detection activities, awareness campaigns on the necessity and safety of TB health service seeking, developing and applying operation protocols for TB surveillance during emergencies which include details regarding prioritization of activities, resource allocation, and post-emergency recovery strategies. Considering that the volume of missed TB cases is large and its long-term impact may be devastating, a catch-up activity on identifying these cases (e.g., temporary intensification of active case finding sessions, household contact screening, self-reporting campaigns) was suggested to reverse adverse impacts. [45](#B45-jkms-38-e43) [58](#B58-jkms-38-e43) [60](#B60-jkms-38-e43) [68](#B68-jkms-38-e43)As possible surge in TB case notifications may occur after social functions and health services are normalized, it is essential to ensure capacity in all spectra of TB preventive services including laboratory, early detection, and patient "}
