Short-term personal psychotherapy is available at no charge to currently enrolled students, up to 10 sessions per calendar year. The SHAC invites students to schedule an initial intake appointment with a staff therapist. During this initial intake, the therapist will assist students in obtaining the appropriate services to address the concerns by recommending services on and off campus. Student concerns that can be addressed within a brief model of therapy are usually referred to the SHAC while more comprehensive concerns or medication issues requiring longer-term therapy are best addressed in the community. Some of the issues that are commonly addressed in short-term counseling at the SHAC include: - Personal Issues: Stress and anxiety, depression, anger, loneliness, guilt, self-esteem, grief and loss - Relationship Issues: Romantic relationship difficulties, sexual concerns, roommate conflicts, difficulties with co-workers, issues with family or friends - Developmental Issues: Identity development, adjustment to college, life transitions, cultural concerns - Academic Concerns: Performance anxiety, perfectionism, underachievement, motivation - Other Issues: Spiritual concerns, body image/food preoccupation, healthy lifestyle choices, alcohol and drug use concerns, sexual assault Scheduling an Appointment: Students at the OAKLAND campus can make initial intake appointments by contacting the SHAC at (510) 879-9288. Faculty and Staff Counseling staff are available to provide faculty and staff with a variety of services including consultations about students you may be concerned about, classroom presentations and other mental health outreach needs.
