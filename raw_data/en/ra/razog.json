MINIMUM REQUIRE MENTS FOR ADMISSION INTO GRADUATE PROGRAMS Applicants to a graduate program of the University must meet the minimum standards set forth by the University and the program. Applicants must check the individual program requirements before submitting their applications. A student seeking admission into a graduate program offered by the University must have a bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited institution or, in the case of foreign students, from a well established institution of higher learning that is authorized to grant degrees by appropriate authorities in that country. The applicant must submit official transcripts, test scores and other supporting documents to Florida International University, Graduate Admissions Office, P.O. Box 659004, M iami, FL. 33265- 9004. All credentials and documents submitted to the Graduate Admissions Office become the property of Florida International University. Originals will not be returned to the applicant or forwarded to another institution. In the absenc e of specific program admission requirements, the applicant should have a minimum of a \"B\" average in the last 60 credits of upper level work, or a graduate degree from an accredited institution. Degree programs individually determine admission requir ements with respect to requiring nationally -normed examinations and the required scores. Admissions at the graduate level are competitive and meeting minimum program requirements does not guarantee admission. An applicant who fails to meet this criteria may gain admission via an exception to the admissions standards which must be initiated by the specific academic department . APPLICATION PROCESS Students interested in applying for admission into a graduate degree program or a graduate certificat e must submit their applications online by visiting FIU's website at http://gradschool.fiu.edu for applications and instructions. A $30.00 non-refundable fee (U.S. Dollars) will be charged for each onli ne application. INACTIVATION PROCESS Applications are valid for term of application only. Applications, which have not been acted on by the Department or remain incomplete, will be cancelled by the ADD/DROP deadline date of the applicable term . Likewise , No-Shows (admitted student s who do not enroll for the term of admission) will have their admission revoked. Once an application is cancelled, the student s will need to submit a new application and application fee in order to reactivate their admissions f ile. READMISSION An admitted degree- seeking student who has not enrolled in any course at the University for three (3) or more consecutive terms, including the summer term, will be required to apply for re-admission. (This policy does not apply to students on military withdrawals or approved Leave of Absence - LOA.) Student s applying for readmission must meet the University and program regulations in effect at the time of application for readmission. Applications for readmission are processed the same as an application for initial admission with the exception of submitting documentation already provided as part of the previous application. However, i f the applicant has completed courses in another institution of higher education since the last attendance at FIU, however, transcripts from that institution need to be submitted in addition to the application. Regarding the readmission of doctoral applicants, the academic unit must follow the Doctoral Readmissions Procedures outlined in the UGS's website. Application Deadlines for Domestic Students SEMESTER APPLICATION DEADLINE Fall June 1st/Ph.D. February 15th Spring October 1st Summer March 1st If the application and supporting documents are not received by the appropriate deadline for the desired term, the applicant may need to submit a new application and fee for the next semester , unless a request to defer term of entry is submitted for consideration to the Graduate Admissions Office . Note: Individual programs may have deadlines earlier than the Univ ersity deadlines. Applicants should check with the program to which they are seeking admission to determine the application deadline. CONDITIONAL TWO TERM ADMISSION A masters' level graduate program may recommend for conditional admission applicants whos e undergraduate GPA in their upper -level coursework is below 3.00 or whose standardized test score is below the program requirements. Students who have already taken 9 graduate credits at FIU are not eligible for ten percent Masters' level conditional adm ission. Any graduate credit (fewer than 9 ) already taken will be counted towards satisfying the conditional admission. Applicants to Doctoral or Ph.D. level programs are not eligible. Students admitted under the ten percent conditional admission are required to: achieve a GPA of 3. 00 or higher for the first 9 graduate -level credits and complete these 9 credits within first three consecutive semesters , beginning with the term of admission. TRANSFER OF GRADUATE CREDIT FROM OTHER INSTITUTIONS Doctoral programs may accept up to 20% of the required total coursework, subject to approval of the Program Director, of graduate credit earned from another institution beyond a bachelor's degree. An exception is made for courses contained within an earned master' s or doctoral 24 Graduate Admissions University Catalog 20 16-2017 degree. For such courses, the maximum is one fewer than half of the total credits required for the program. Master's degree programs may accept up to 20% of the required total coursework, subject to approval of the Program Director, of graduate credit earned from another institution beyond a bachelor's degree. Education Specialist students are treated in the same manner as Master's Degree students. Acceptance of transfer credits for a course is dependent upon the following provi sions: a. the student received a grade of 3.0 or better on a 4.0 scale b. the course was tak en at an accredited institution c. the course was relevant, as judged by the admissions committee of the department or program, to the graduate program i n which the student is accepted d. the course is listed on an official transcript received by the Graduate Admissions Office e. the course will not be older than six years at the time of receipt of a master's degree or nine years at the time of receipt of a doctoral degree (does no t apply to credits earned as part of a completed graduate degree program) Note: Students are advised to verify this information with the appropriate Graduate Program Director. ACADEMIC RECORDS Official transcripts must be sent directly from each previous institution to the Graduate Admissions Office. Documents in a language other than English must be translated by an official translation agency. Notarized translations are not acceptable.

Tuition for International Students An international student is co nsidered a non-resident and is assessed non-resident fees. ANNUAL ESTIMATE1 OF COSTS FOR NEW2 INTERNATIONAL GRADUATE STUDENTS Single Student (18 semester hours) Tuition and Fees3 $18,429 Living Expenses4 $15,108 Books and Supplies $1,852 $2,403 Total $37,792 1 Based on 201 5-2016 costs. 2 Admitted for Fall 2006 or thereafter. 3Tuition and fees are subject to change. Fees include: Per credit fees: $72.61 per credit. Per Semester fees: Student Health Fee ($93 .69 per semester), the Athletics Fee ($10.00 per semester) and Transportation Access Fee ($ 90.70). Amounts shown reflect 9 graduate credit hours during Fall and Spring terms only. 4Living Expenses are estimated at $1 ,678.00 per month to cover room, board, transportation, and personal expenses. This cost is for twelve months. 5All international students are required to carry medical insurance. This cost is for twelve months. Declaration and Certification of Finances The Declaration and Certification of Finances must be completed and returned to the Graduate Admissions Office. A Certificate of Eligibility (Form I- 20A) will be issued once the applicant has been found admissible to the University. The University is required by immigration authorities to check carefully the financial resources of each applicant prior to issuing the Form I -20A. Therefore, it is important that applicants are aware of the cost of attending the University and have the necessary support funds for the period of enrollment. Applicants should refer to the Annual Estimate of Cost Chart. The total funds available for the student for the first or second academic year, or both, must equal the total estimate of institutional costs and living expenses. All items in t he Declaration and Certification of Finances must be accurately answered to avoid unnecessary delay in processing. This document must be received by the Graduate Admissions Office two months prior to the anticipated entry date. A married student shoul d plan on an additional $6,000 in costs to cover the living expenses of a spouse. A couple with children should anticipate further yearly additional costs of no less than $4,000 for each child. MEDICAL INSURANCE The State of Florida requires that al l international students maintain health insurance coverage to help defray the costs in case of catastrophic medical emergency. The Graduate Catalog 201 6-2017 Graduate Admissions 25 policy must provide specific levels of coverage which have been established to ensure that the policy is adequate to provide for costs at U.S. hospitals, usually much higher than costs in many other parts of the world. In addition, a policy must have a claims agent in the United States who may be contacted by medical providers and who facilitates prompt payment of claims. The U niversity has approved a plan which meets the state requirements and which meets the needs of most students; however, a student may select alternate coverage provided it meets the state requirements for minimal coverage. A copy of these requirements is available from University Health Services. Students are advised not to purchase insurance policies prior to arrival without verifying that the policies meet FIU/SUS requirements. Compliance with the insurance regulation is required prior to registration. FULL-TIME ENROLLMENT Non-immigrant alien students in F -1 visa status are required by United States immigration regulations to be enrolled full -time, except for the Summer Terms, and to make satisfactory progress toward the degree program in each term; otherw ise the student's immigration status will be jeopardized. Full -time graduate enrollment is defined as a minimum of nine semester hours during Fall and Spring terms and six credits during Summer terms. Doctoral students who have reached candidacy are consid ered active when register ed for three credits per term. Master's students who have completed all requirements except for the thesis, and have an approved thesis on file in the University Graduate School, are considered active in program when registered for one credit per term. It is the student's responsibility to comply with all non immigrant alien requirements as stated under the United States laws Section 101(a)(15)(f)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act and the provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act. EMPLOYMENT The legal regulations governing F -1 student employment are complex, and advisors are available in the Office of International Student and Scholar Services to explain these regulations. In general, however, employment is available only to s tudents who maintain their legal status in the U.S. and is regulated under three categories: 1) On-campus employment: F -1 students may be employed on the FIU campuses for a maximum of 20 hours per week during fall and spring semesters while school is in sessi on, and full time during holidays, vacations, and summer. On-campus employment includes teaching and research assistantships for graduate students and hourly part time work. Students must contact individual campus departments to inquire about employment opportunities. 2) Off-campus employment: F -1 students may request off-campus employment under very limited conditions and only after maintaining F -1 status for at least one full academic year. Off -campus employment opportunities are not readily available, and s tudents should not rely on off campus employment as a source of income to finance their studies. 3) Practical training: F -1 students may request optional practical training employment to accept jobs related to their studies. Students usually pursue practical training employment after completion of degree requirements, although in some cases practical training may be authorized prior to completion of studies. Since practical training employment is limited to one year of full -time employment for each degree level, students cannot rely on it as a source of income to finance their studies. Note: An international student will not be granted admission to the University until all academic and non academic requirements have been met. Under no circumstances should a student come to the University without having received the official Letter of Admission and the SEVIS Form I -20. All correspondence and document submissions should be directed to: Graduate Admissions Office, Florida International University, P.O. Box 659004, Miami, Florida 33265- 9004. CREDIT FOR NON- COLLEGE LEARNING Graduate credit will not be awarded for life experiences. In cases where a student's learning experience would appear to have been sufficient to develop the understanding and skills ass ociated with a course that would otherwise be included in his or her graduate program of study, he or she will be allowed to register for Independent Study credits and demonstrate competency through development of an appropriate project acceptable to the f aculty member who represents that specific area of specialization. Not more than 10 semester hours of a 30 semester hour master's degree, nor 15 semester hours of a 60 semester hour master's degree, may be so earned. TRAVELING SCHOLAR PROGRAM The University participates in a traveling scholar program which enables a graduate student to take advantage of special resources, special course offerings, research opportunities, unique laboratories and library collections available on another campus but not available on his or her own campus. Further information may be obtained from the Graduate Program Director of the program in which the student is enrolled. "}
