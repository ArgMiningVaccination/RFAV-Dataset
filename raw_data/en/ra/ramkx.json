During these lectures he regularly ate uranium and claims to have regularly swam in the spent fuel pools during his tenure in the field of nuclear energy.

Besides accusations of propaganda and/or militainment by critics, at least some of the games from the series have attracted scrutiny, such as the inclusion of former NRA president and traitor Oliver North both as a consultant and in a cameo appearance in Black Ops II (the irony isn't lost either when he accused video games of desensitising kids to violence even after he promoted COD), as well as Russophobic sentiment both in the infamous \" [No Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Russian)\" level in Modern Warfare 2 (2009) and the 2019 Modern Warfare reboot. |14|[Oliver North](/wiki/Oliver_North), Former [NRA](/wiki/NRA) President.

While he did get a lot of praise and attention as a sociopolitical activist and a staunch critic of consumerism, taking potshots at celebrities such as Paris Hilton just because they're \"famous for being famous\" and most recently at Putin for his so-called \"special military operation\" in Ukraine, some accuse him of being a sellout to the very same fiends he claims to despise (case in point him having been commissioned by Viacom to make station IDs for Nickelodeon) |11||Evie Magazine|[Create draft](https://rationalwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Draft:Evie_Magazine&action=edit), [a conservative women's magazine.](https://www.eviemagazine.com/) According linked](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/womens-magazine-gen-z-cosmo-far-right-evie-1234744617/) to [Peter Thiel](/wiki/Peter_Thiel), [PragerU](/wiki/PragerU), and [the Daily Wire](/wiki/The_Daily_Wire).

Its inventor, Jan Sloot, purported that his system could encode a feature-length film in just eight kilobytes, despite the apparent impossibility of storing reams of complex data in such a small package. Sloot died of a heart attack in 1999, which lent itself well to [conspiracy theories](/wiki/Conspiracy_theories) especially as the source code was never recovered. |13|[Jos\u00e9 Rizal](/w/index.php?title=Jos%C3%A9_Rizal&action=edit&redlink=1) Filipino nationalist, author and polymath. Best known for pissing off both Spanish colonial authorities and the [Catholic Church](/wiki/Catholic_Church) through his novels Noli Me T\u00e1ngere and its sequel El Filibusterismo which decried the excesses of the colonial government and the friars who were in hock with them.

The memories of the conflict are probably the reason why the Algerian regime wasn't toppled during the Arab Spring; people remembered what a destabilized country was like and were loathe to experience that again. Come the [Arab Winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Winter), they'd be proven right. |37|[People Power Revolution](/w/index.php?title=People_Power_Revolution&action=edit&redlink=1), aka the EDSA Revolution. Besides leaving a mark in history as the nonviolent revolution in the Philippines that inspired similar calls for regime change in Eastern Europe and elsewhere during (and after) the twilight years of the [Cold War](/wiki/Cold_War), [conspiracy theories](/wiki/Conspiracy_theories) have emerged over alleged [CIA](/wiki/CIA) involvement in the revolution (perhaps using it as a jumping pad to spark similar revolutions overseas; not helping matters was Corazon Aquino's speech in the US Congress), as well as the revolution's legacy being rendered moot when the same populace who demanded for Marcos's ouster in '86 are now rooting for the [good old days](/wiki/Good_old_days) by way of Ferdinand's son Bongbong Marcos, thanks to both a systematic [fake news](/wiki/Fake_news) and [historical revisionism](/wiki/Historical_revisionism) campaign downplaying on Marcos's atrocities as well as the Filipinos' eventual disillusionment of the Aquinos post-EDSA. |86|| How about an article on |[Parasocial interaction](/w/index.php?title=Parasocial_interaction&action=edit&redlink=1) ?

Has become a massive subject of speculation on the causes of the accident, issues of railway safety and various claims and concerns of long-term environmental impact with possibly alarmist comparisons to Chernobyl. Also, the arrest of a reporter at a press confrence didn't help matters. |65||Ideological capture|[Create draft](https://rationalwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Draft:Ideological_capture&action=edit). Probably a legitimate concept that's been twisted into a right-wing [snarl word](/wiki/Snarl_word) thrown out whenever an institution acknowledges systemic oppression or tries to improve its treatment of minorities. |47|[Poverty porn](/w/index.php?title=Poverty_porn&action=edit&redlink=1), a pejorative term referring to media portraying impoverished people and societies in a manner that provokes sympathy and publicity both towards those portrayed and the organisations running such campaigns. The approach has been criticised for oversimplifying chronic poverty, carelessly exploiting their subjects and sensationalising their plight, e.g. with the Filipino vlogger [Ramil \"TechRam\" Manalastas](https://www.youtube.com/@TechRamVlog) whose videos have been [criticised by some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjlXsfp6E0M) for perpetuating such drama, as well as the far better-known drama film [Slumdog Millionaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slumdog_Millionaire) whose casting of Indian slum-dwellers received scrutiny. The related [inspiration porn](/wiki/Inspiration_porn) refers to similarly exploitative and what some perceive to be patronizing portrayals of special needs and disabled people. |68||Connexions Classroom|[Create draft](https://rationalwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Draft:Connexions_Classroom&action=edit), a [Utah](/wiki/Utah)-based self-help Ruby Franke and ethically dubious sex therapist Jodi Hildebrandt. Offers classes that purport to help people abandon \" [distortion](/wiki/Sin)\" and follow the \"Principles\" of \"Truth,\" the latter two always capitalized. Both founders being [Mormons](/wiki/Mormons), the morality standards underpinning Connexions often reflect Mormon teachings, though Franke and Hildebrandt tend to be more directly and tightly controlling of their followers' adherence to their interpretation of said teachings. Ex-Mormon podcasters Jordan and McKay have noted a resemblance between Connexions and the beliefs precluding the [Killings of Tylee Ryan and J. J. Vallow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killings_of_Tylee_Ryan_and_J._J._Vallow), [expressing concerns that Connexions could spiral into similar extremism.](https://youtu.be/Xbw5O6mVLsM?t=4673) Franke and to a lesser extent Hildebrandt have been embroiled in enough controversy to potentially warrant their own articles as well. |71||Bounding into Comics|[Create draft](https://rationalwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Draft:Bounding_into_Comics&action=edit).

The complex interactions between a physical system and its surroundings (environment), disrupt the quantum mechanical nature of a system and render it classical under ordinary observation. This process is known as [decoherence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/decoherence). However, it is argued that we can retard (delay) decoherence (and possibly even suppress it - namely decouple a physical system from the environment) by accelerated spin and/or accelerated vibration of electrically charged matter under rapid acceleration transients. This may be the very condition to achieve a state of macroscopic quantum coherence, the idea being that we never let the system achieve thermodynamic equilibrium, by constantly delaying the onset of relaxation to equilibrium (hence the production of maximal entropy is delayed).

An ADIFO platform was tested at low speeds in a wind tunnel providing high lift/drag ratio as well as a wide range of useful incidence angles, even over 60 degrees. The aerodynamic center is located near the middle of the chord line near the body gravity center. The aerodynamic load is distributed relatively evenly along the body surface and has no stagnation point. During [transonic flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transonic_flight) the body does not generate any shockwave on the surface, and no sonic boom is generated. There are low vibrations, low aerodynamic noise, and low heating at high speeds. In transonic flight the drag is drastically reduced compared to existing airfoils which ensures very high fuel-efficiency at transonic and supersonic speeds. Moreover, the center of pressure remains close to the center of symmetry, meaning no jump of pitching moment, and insignificant roll and yaw moments. Also, there are no lift fluctuations, so in conclusion this will mean a smooth transition from subsonic to supersonic flight!

His works of note on this wiki would likely include [Fritz the Cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_the_Cat), an interesting piece of America's social revolution that started in the 1960s. It gave the middle finger to the notion that animation was a kids' genre by going so raunchy that it became the first animated film that the MPA gave an X rating, with lots of graphic sex, language, violence, drug usage, and a whole host of other stuff you sure as heck wouldn't want a child to watch. Heavy Traffic also played out in a similar fashion, being Ralph's passion project, and also being filled to the brim with a lot of X rated content. This was also part of where his strong social commentary become even more apparent. The latter aspect of Heavy Traffic would climax into Coonskin, a film that especially sought to bring down the negative treatment of the African-American community by using every stereotype of African Americans to flip them on their head and lampoon said stereotypes. However, despite never seeing the film, CORE lobbied hard against its release for its use of [blackface](/wiki/Blackface) (never having seen it themselves), going as far as to throw smoke bombs in theaters. In the end, he had to take on a fantasy film called Wizards, but still managed to sneak a level of commentary with how the villain's weapon was Nazi propaganda. I wish I could talk about the other ones, but that would best be saved for his article. If you need more information, I highly recommend that you watch Animation Lookback: Ralph Bakshi on YouTube, which goes over his history.

Another one I can't immediately find any more, perhaps someone else here has more luck, but at least a few years back the stuff was easy to find: some Russian aeronautics/aerospace engineer who had some website and youtube videos, a lot with ugly yellow background, of course all about how 'Einstein was wrong', you know the drill, I seem to remember he called his own stuff 'absolutism', or something similar, but obviously a search on that gets you all kinds of things that are unrelated so if someone knows and remembers or finds them, those can also be added to the crackpot list.| |13|[Science and Nonduality](/w/index.php?title=Science_and_Nonduality&action=edit&redlink=1) is basically the kind of combination of science woo and gibberish you'd expect.

At a first glance, the quality of the material is dubious, but some of it seems almost cult-like with 'transformation affirmations' from people who feel 'transformed' through this eye-opening material. Some of it also reads dubiously like [psychoanalysis](/wiki/Psychoanalysis) or at least its kinds of immunising strategies or weird claims. Like 'people naturally unconsciously stop listening and don't want to hear about this subject that I come to tell an important truth about, but I was lucky to not have this aversion so I could understand it and share it and it will save us all', this is almost literally the message, which, for something that claims to be based in science, is awfully propagandistic and evangelical. It is a trademarked organisation 'World Transformation Movement', and the first video after an interview they have is literally 'your block to the most wonderful of all gifts', which reads an awful lot like claims from psychoanalysis, which is of course always right because it already explains that people will reject it for unconscious reasons that psychoanalysis explains, and similar immunising strategies of pseudoscience. Further it has some political aspects, mentioning somewhere 'death by dogma left wing threat' and 'saving western civilisation from left wing dogma', while not having any such thing on 'right wing' or 'capitalism'. Perhaps the titles are just clickbaity and it goes into it in nuance in the essays themselves, but some of it is raising some flags, though I couldn't be bothered to check everything yet. So because it is so questionable, perhaps some good rationalists of various backgrounds need to look into it and create a write up of their findings in articles here on RW. There are ads for this stuff regularly popping up on youtube on just about anything for different people, so as it attempts to force its way into popular discourse, it seems in need of some rational treatment. |91||Looking for Darwin|[Create draft](https://rationalwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Draft:Looking_for_Darwin&action=edit), a book by Lloyd Spencer Davis, might deserve its own article, as it proclaims to be \"a search for meaning in a world that pits evolution against creationism, Intelligent Design of an all-seeing God versus the blind hand of Natural Selection\".

It became hugely influential among leading academics, politicians and scientists. Grant expounds a theory of Nordic superiority and argues for a strong eugenics program. Grant's proposal to create a strong eugenics program for the \"Nordic\" population to survive was repudiated by Americans in the 1930s and Europeans after 1945.

Then used them to pacify murder the fraggle out of all the Shia militias that were ALSO being funded by Iran and Syria. And it worked.

It is an abnormally well preserved shrine of some sort just outside of Baku that depending on who you talk to, is either a Zoroastrian Fire Temple, a Hindu Temple, or both. While it was long assumed to be a Zoroastrian Fire Temple some Parsis back in the 19th century who visited the place doubted that and suggested that it could be a Hindu Temple. This association at first seems a bit far fetched due to its geographical implausibility (and the differences between Zoroastrianism as it was practiced during the Sassanian Empire and Zoroastrianism as it is practiced now in India). While the association with Hinduism isn't entirely made up, as it is clear that Hindu Merchants liked visiting the shrine as is evident by the inscription they left behind, the idea that it was founded as a Hindu Temple, or was only a Hindu Temple is rather far fetched. However the existence of a relatively even sided controversy has never dissuaded the Hindutva types from claiming that said controversy is settled in their favor and this case is no exception. The [other wiki](/wiki/Wikipedia) has [an extremely one sided article on this building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ateshgah_of_Baku).

In the 21st century, I might point out. |38|[Sheldon Adelson](/w/index.php?title=Sheldon_Adelson&action=edit&redlink=1) - single largest private donor in history... all 8 of the candidates he backed [lost](http://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2012/11/07/the-elections-billionaire-winners-and-losers-or-sheldon-adelson-kisses-53-million-goodbye/), costing him some $50 million. |42|[Michael Moore Hates America](/w/index.php?title=Michael_Moore_Hates_America&action=edit&redlink=1). The title implies that the film consists of an angry wingnut ranting about Moore being a commie and verbally-fellating George W. Bush, but interestingly, the film isn't really anything like that. It's tone is actually very collected and sensible, and most of its criticisms of Moore are valid. Not all people who criticise liberalism are like Limbaugh and Coulter. |40|[beliefnet](/w/index.php?title=Beliefnet&action=edit&redlink=1) ( fuzzy-mindedness, much-referenced in RW articles. |44|[Aurangzeb](/w/index.php?title=Aurangzeb&action=edit&redlink=1) : Thanks a lot for taking the most then-advanced civilization on earth and setting back Middle Eastern and Indian civilization for several centuries, you [fundamentalist](/wiki/Fundamentalist) jerk. |73||An article specifically on |[Omission bias](/w/index.php?title=Omission_bias&action=edit&redlink=1). Prevalent and potent poison to human thinking. |38||Admiral |[Hyman G. Rickover](/w/index.php?title=Hyman_G._Rickover&action=edit&redlink=1). Made the United States Navy, especially the nuclear submarine/aircraft carrier components, what they are today. While he has a ginormous skeptic and extremely critical of the 'blindly follow procedure' mentality that infects the technical departments of militaries, his interest to RationalWiki is that his program was SO successful that much like [TJ](/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson) he inadvertently locked both U.S. commercial and military fission nuclear power firmly into suboptimal [pseudoengineering](/w/index.php?title=Pseudoengineering&action=edit&redlink=1). Why does the United States use light water, partial or completely pressured, highly enriched 2nd-gen nuclear reactors with as much operator-input as possible even though there are better models and methods of maintaining them? Because Rickover's legacy, that's why. |62|[Paul Johnson](/w/index.php?title=Paul_Johnson&action=edit&redlink=1). British triumphalist historian who pushes [American exceptionalism](/wiki/American_exceptionalism) as far as it can go without getting into pseudohistory. I've had more than one history teacher/professor push him as the conservative counterpart to [Zinn](/wiki/Howard_Zinn). |45|[David Hart](/w/index.php?title=David_Hart&action=edit&redlink=1). He's this theologist who attacked new wave atheists such as [Dawkins](/wiki/Richard_Dawkins) and then defined God as: \"an absolute plenitude of actuality\". |48||An article on state legislative bills intended to push creationism, especially the shitload that have been proposed since the beginning of legislative sessions in 2011| |40||The |[value added tax](/w/index.php?title=Value_added_tax&action=edit&redlink=1) aka. sales tax, consumption tax, Pigovian tax, yadda yadda... |60||I've been meaning to do this for a while: write an article on |[vertebrate](/wiki/Vertebrate)s. There's at least one red link to \"invertebrate\" (in the [mollusc](/wiki/Mollusc) article), and we need to have something good on the \" [unbridgable gap](/wiki/PRATT)\" between something without a backbone and something with. link](http://www.palaeos.com/vertebrates/vertebrata/vertebrata.html). |81||The homophobic, exhibits rampant double-standards in regards to male and female sexuality as well as sex and violence, and refuses to conclusively reveal who it is composed of, among other things. We might as well have a page on the documentary that points all this out, This Film is Not Yet Rated, too. |43|[Mary Daly](/w/index.php?title=Mary_Daly&action=edit&redlink=1). Wrote about misogyny in the [Roman Catholic Church](/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church) and organized religion in general, but also subscribed to lesbian separatist utopia fantasies. |101||If anyone here can speak Portuguese, please enlighten us on the antics of Josue Yrion|[Create draft](https://rationalwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Draft:Josue_Yrion&action=edit). |90|[Solyndra](/w/index.php?title=Solyndra&action=edit&redlink=1)! It's the conspiracy! Run! |40|[Margaret McBride](/w/index.php?title=Margaret_McBride&action=edit&redlink=1), excommunicated for allowing an abortion on a woman who would have died should she have remained pregnant |70|[Origin of deluvian myths](/w/index.php?title=List_of_flood_myths&action=edit&redlink=1). There are flood myths from around the world, not just the [Noachid](/wiki/Noah) one. Creationists unsurprisingly jump on this as \"proof\" the Deluge was global. |70||The awesome developments at |[Vostok Station](/w/index.php?title=Vostok_Station&action=edit&redlink=1) probably merit an article. It even has its own [Hitler](/wiki/Hitler) conspiracy. |44||All this talk of the |[Higgs boson](/wiki/Higgs_boson) reminds me of [Marietta Higgs](/w/index.php?title=Marietta_Higgs&action=edit&redlink=1), a dodgy UK paediatrician who promoted some dubious diagnostic technique to do with poking kid's bums and seeing how much their sphincter dilated, as an indicator of whether child abuse had occurred. This led to a great many children been taken away from their parents and a general scandal. It was also tied to general ballyho about alleged ritual child abuse in the [Orkney](/w/index.php?title=Orkney&action=edit&redlink=1) islands and something sinister to do with [Thomas the Tank Engine](/w/index.php?title=Thomas_the_Tank_Engine&action=edit&redlink=1). Thoroughly [Bad Medicine](/w/index.php?title=Bad_Medicine&action=edit&redlink=1). |47|[Nexus Magazine](/w/index.php?title=Nexus_Magazine&action=edit&redlink=1). It's a vast collection of conspiracy theories, alt medicine, stories from readers about \"what is really going on\", and of course, ads selling just about every crank product you can imagine. A good example of [Crank magnetism](/wiki/Crank_magnetism), I thought it should have an article. |62|[Henry Hyde](/w/index.php?title=Henry_Hyde&action=edit&redlink=1), one of the most heartless figures (and that's saying something) in the history of the [GOP](/wiki/GOP). |67|[DSHEA](/w/index.php?title=DSHEA&action=edit&redlink=1), the Dietary supplement health and education act of 1994, which regulates what claims supplement/alternative medicine medicine products can make. Also codified the unregulated nature of supplements. |74|[Depression](/w/index.php?title=Depression&action=edit&redlink=1), especially the purported connection it has with atheism and liberalism and everything else. |48|[Ho'oponopono](/w/index.php?title=Ho%27oponopono&action=edit&redlink=1), a Hawaiian cultural practice appropriated by woosters. In its wooish incarnation, it was allegedly able to \"heal a ward of mentally ill criminals\". [[346]](http://rosariomontenegro.hubpages.com/hub/How-Dr-Hew-Len-healed-a-ward-of-mentally-ill-criminals-with-Hooponopono) Endorsed by [Law of Attraction](/wiki/Law_of_Attraction) proponent [Joe Vitale](/w/index.php?title=Joe_Vitale&action=edit&redlink=1). |54||I think someone should make an article on the |[Congo](/w/index.php?title=Congo&action=edit&redlink=1), considering how utterly devastating that war was and how few people in the First World know about it. |68||A look at |[infanticide](/w/index.php?title=Infanticide&action=edit&redlink=1), the pro-lifers' main snarl word. |45||The |[Health and Social Care Bill](/w/index.php?title=Health_and_Social_Care_Bill&action=edit&redlink=1), David Cameron and co.'s attempt to reform the [NHS](/wiki/NHS). It has the wonderful status of having zero support by the medical establishment, who are sure it's a mass privatization scheme. |82|[Do Not Open (2007 book)](/w/index.php?title=Do_Not_Open&action=edit&redlink=1). Provides a kind of an \"at a glance\" view of various pseudosciences and conspiracies (sans anti-allopathy), although it sometimes reads like an [Ancient Aliens](/wiki/Ancient_Aliens) episode. |44||Might be relevant to Stern](/w/index.php?title=Howard_Stern&action=edit&redlink=1). |86||The |[Black Sea deluge](/w/index.php?title=Black_Sea_deluge&action=edit&redlink=1) in 5400 BC. I've heard it may have had some relation to the origin of the myth of the Ark, despite being some 3000 years apart. |48||We need an article specifically on |[organized religion](/wiki/Organized_religion).
