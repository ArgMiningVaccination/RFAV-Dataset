The body can heal itself; from the smallest cut to life-threatening illness. Our mental health can be healed in the same manner. But just as we sometimes need the help of a healthcare professional for our physical ailments, we often need help to heal the broken areas of our emotional self as well. When it comes to emotional healing, there are a myriad of approaches, from traditional methods like psychotherapy to less conventional ones, like nutrition. In this modern era, there are as many treatment alternatives for psychiatric disorders as there are for medical problems. Yet, the question of whether to use standard, complementary or alternative therapies is often a matter of what is available. For example, if you're experiencing depression in Europe, you'll have a much easier time finding a medical doctor to prescribe the herb St. John's wort than you will if you live in the United States. This is because herbal medicine is considered the first standard of care among many European medical doctors, whereas drug therapy is generally the first choice of U.S. physicians. This is not to imply that drugs are bad, but limited options do translate into a limited standard of care when methods that may be the most beneficial are not available in some instances. This is the jumping off point for the consumer. In order to learn the available options for a particular health problem, we must do considerable research to find out what works and where to get services. Once a place is found that provides the service we're interested in, we face the daunting task of determining if the healthcare practitioner is competent and trustworthy. While medical doctors in the U.S. have been criticized for not mentioning alternative options to patients and for not giving enough personalized care, alternative healthcare practitioners don't necessarily fare any better. Just because someone is an alternative healthcare provider does not mean that he or she is competent or caring. We live in a culture that places too much value on appearances. In reality, charisma does not equal competence. Sadly, many of us do not find out that a healthcare provider is negligent or incompetent until after our health has been compromised. Recently, I've been shocked by the number of female clients I've seen who've never had a healthcare provider talk to them about osteoporosis. On a consistent basis, I've talked to women at clear risk for significant bone loss due to one or more factors, such as dieting, smoking, alcohol abuse, or menopause. When I've asked if any healthcare professional has recommended a bone mineral density test, 9 out of 10 times I am told no. This simple, inexpensive test is the only definitive way to know exactly what a person's bone density is, yet very few healthcare professionals are telling women at risk about it. Without this test, the extent of bone disease cannot be identified and appropriate treatment cannot begin. This is of particular concern as osteoporosis is considered the world's second most prevalent health disorder.\u00b2 Long considered a woman's disease, recent research has discovered that men are at substantial risk as well.\u00b3 Additionally, osteoporosis can have a significant negative impact on mental health, having been strongly associated with major depression, eating disorders, and addiction to alcohol, opiates, and nicotine. When we put the fate of our health in the hands of others, we're apt to be disappointed. Ultimately, we must take responsibility for own health and become educated. The goal of this book is exactly that; to discuss alternative and complementary methods that have been scientifically proven to benefit mental health problems. A growing body of evidence has demonstrated the powerful effect that complementary and alternative therapies\u2014like nutrition and lifestyle\u2014have on our psychological well-being. As scientific evidence accumulates in support of non-conventional approaches to mental healthcare, more and more practitioners are suggesting these methods to patients. Since prevention of disease is as imperative as treatment, studies showing the effectiveness of preventative measures are more valuable than ever. By examining this information with fresh eyes, we can glean suggestions on how to make lifestyle changes for optimum mental health. This book is more that a mere compendium of integrative and holistic mental health therapies. It is intended as an educational tool, exposing the breadth of complementary and alternative therapies available for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. People are turning to these therapies in record numbers. In 1991, 34% of the U.S. adult population used at least one such therapy for the year. Over the next 7 years that figure rose to 40%. A survey released in 2004 by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine revealed that 36% of Americans used some form of alternative therapy in the previous 12 months, and 50% had during their lifetime.\u00b9 These therapies include nutrition counseling, special diets, herbal treatments, meditation, and yoga. People turn to unconventional therapies for a variety of reasons. The most common reason cited for seeking advice from an alternative provider in the U.S. is anxiety, followed by depression and headaches.\u00b9\u00b9 Of those who use complementary and alternative medicine, 59% perceive it to be at least as effective as pharmacology.\u00b9\u00b2 In surveys, people have given several reasons for using alternative treatment options, including recommendations by word of mouth (32%), fear of side effects associated with conventional therapies (21%), chronic medical problems (19%), dissatisfaction with conventional medicine (14%), and desire for more personalized attention (9%).\u00b9\u00b3 The major advance of complementary and alternative approaches lies in the power such methods provide for education and exerting control over personal healthcare. Preventing Illness with Nutrition and Herbal Medicine Among complementary and alternative therapies, nutrition and herbal medicine are by far the most popular and the most frequently studied. Food, dietary supplements and herbs interact biochemically with our physiology to create powerful effects on our mental health. Food is something that many of us take for granted. Because we have easy access to food, we generally don't think about its immense healing power or the nutrients it provides. It's easy to eat unconsciously without considering the nature of what we put in our body. The word nutrition is derived from the Latin word nutrire, meaning to nourish. Likewise, food is defined as any substance that is a source of nourishment, can be metabolized by an organism to give energy and build tissue, and provide mental stimulus for thinking. While food can be nutritive, it can also be pleasurable and powerful, as proven by a large body of clinical research. Food can harm and it can heal. Herbs, which are also food, are one of man's most powerful medicinal allies. Throughout history in the East and the West, healers have recognized the importance of diet, and strived to understand its health-promoting and healing powers. Only relatively recently, with the development of sophisticated scientific tools of measurement, have researchers begun to appreciate how and why this is the case. The explosion of interest in nutrition has led to fascinating revelations, most of which confirm the opinions of ancient medical practitioners, while uncovering new and exciting opportunities to understand how we can improve mental health through dietary manipulation. A substantial portion of this book is devoted to the examination of such research. While collecting studies on how nutritional, herbal supplements, and lifestyle modifications affect psychological conditions, I developed a strong respect for the researchers. These men and women are pioneers who design, carry out and measure study results that tell us what works and what doesn't. At some point during the examination of this massive body of data, I decided not to include exact dosage amounts in this book. This was done for a number of reasons. First of all, the dosage amounts specified in each study depend upon a number of variables, such as the patient's health and the results of specific blood panels. Moreover, if an individual were to self-medicate by using the amount specified in a study, it could be harmful. This is true even if the results were positive in the study. If you want more information on a particular study\u2014such as dosages\u2014you can request a copy of it from your local library. If you have any difficulty, ask the reference librarian for assistance. Another reason I decided to opt out of listing the dosages used in each study was to encourage the use of qualified practitioners, such as nutritionists or herbalists, who are best suited to determine exact dosages. Nutritional and herbal supplements are powerful catalysts for healing that are best utilized under the care and direction of a professional. Preventing Illness with Lifestyle Modifications Modern medicine has developed some truly extraordinary ways of accelerating and enhancing healing. But as fast as medical science forges ahead with high-tech methods, the older, gentler modes of healing acquire renewed appeal. In many countries that boast state-of-the-art medicine, many people use non-conventional therapies, such as acupuncture, hydrotherapy, or massage - all healing techniques that are hundreds or even thousands of years old. Not surprisingly, researchers are confirming what traditional healers have always believed: There is a constant interplay between our emotions, beliefs, and actions and our mind and body. The food we eat, the air we breathe, the exercise we get, and how much we laugh or cry all have a direct bearing on our health. This interaction\u2014played out at every level of our physical, emotional being and spiritual self\u2014affects all biochemical, structural, and psychosocial systems. Thanks to modern science, there is a large body of research on how lifestyle changes and complementary and alternative therapies affect mental health. As you read about how a particular modality helps a specific mental health problem\u2014such as how Qigong alleviates depression\u2014remember that it may help other disorders as well. When weighing your options, consider using similar modalities. For example, if there isn't a Qigong class near you, look for something that is energetically similar, such as Tai Chi or Aikido. For the most part, the complementary and alternative therapies listed in this text have been well-researched. There are many more therapies not listed that have been helpful in attenuating mental health problems. Take responsibility for your own health and find out what's available in your area. Education and Responsibility In order to get the most out of any healthcare system, it's helpful to be your own health advocate. Whether you're at the acupuncturist or the psychotherapist, campaigning for your health makes sense. Next time you visit a healthcare practitioner, ask them which patient is easier to help; one who is involved in his or her treatment plan, or one who is not. When we're enthused about getting and staying healthy, our team of healthcare professionals get excited, too. Part of advocating for self healthcare involves education. It's essential to know what's happening with your mind, body and spirit in order to be actively involved in treatment. Learning about your health can be a fascinating and empowering experience. It's a mystery waiting to be revealed. The sacred aspects of psychology, nutrition and natural healing rituals have always been my passion. As I have collected studies about natural methods of healing, I became thrilled over the prospect of backing up complementary and alternative ways of healing with scientific proof. It's a way of welcoming ancient healing rituals into the 21st century. With this book you can discover, in a plain and easy-to-understand way: Biomedical and educational interventions Current intervention methodologies Comprehensive evidence-based information Resources needed for recovery, advocacy, and education to achieve a better quality of life By presenting a wide breath of data on how to approach mental health problems naturally, I hope to motivate you to add new healing modalities to what you use now. No one should have to suffer when there are alternatives. 1 Combining Psychotherapy with Complementary and Alternative Therapies The emerging new paradigm does not reject the old one; it merely seeks to expand it. \u2014 SCOTT SHANNON \u00b9 In order to understand the significance of combining psychotherapy with complementary and alternative therapies, it's useful to have a little background on both. Most people are familiar with the terms psychotherapist and therapist. These titles help differentiate a counseling mental health professional from other types of therapists, such as a massage or physical therapist. The manner in which a psychotherapist approaches their craft varies widely depending on theoretical background and personal preference. Generally speaking, psychotherapists counsel individuals, families and groups about psychological well-being. As you can imagine, this can cover a broad amount of subject matter since all the aspects of our lives\u2014physical, emotional, and spiritual\u2014affect us psychologically. A psychotherapist's theoretical approach has a lot to do with the school they attended. Other influences include special trainings, and certifications and, of course, the person with whom the therapist is working. When describing the attributes of an effective psychotherapist, there are several characteristics that are highly desirable, such as empathy and compassion. It is a requirement for a successful psychotherapist to be able to understand his or her client's feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. In addition, being non-judgmental is vital if the relationship and treatment are going to work. If your psychotherapist judges you, you may not feel safe talking about a similar subject again. Finally, a therapist should have experience with issues similar to yours, be abreast of current research, and be adequately trained. Aside from these commonalties, therapists approach clients from slightly different angles, although the ultimate goals remain the same; to help the client reduce negative symptoms, gain insight into why the symptoms occurred, work through those issues, and reduce the emergence of the symptoms in the future. Branches of Psychotherapy There are many different approaches to psychotherapy, but all effective therapy shares common elements, such as helping the client to process life events and improve overall functioning. As to which type of psychotherapy works best, there is no simple answer. Just as people respond differently to various foods and drugs, the same therapeutic approach won't work for everyone. Many people find that a blended approach\u2014one that draws on elements of different schools of psychology\u2014works the best. The three main branches of psychology are cognitive, behavioral, and psychodynamic.\u00b2 Psychotherapists who follow the cognitive branch will look at dysfunctions and difficulties as arising from irrational or faulty thinking.\u00b3 In other words, we perceive the world in a certain way\u2014which may or may not be accurate\u2014and this results in acting and feeling a certain way. Psychotherapists who lean toward a behavioral model look at problems as arising from behaviors that were learned over years of reinforcement. Finally, psychotherapists in the psychodynamic camp draw from the teachings of theorists like Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud, looking at issues beginning in early childhood which motivate us as adults at an unconscious level. Freud's work in the early 1900s is generally considered to be the beginning of modern psychology and psychotherapy. In comparison to other methods of healing that have spanned centuries, psychotherapy is relatively new. One branch of psychology isn't necessarily better than the other, but certain approaches have a more holistic philosophy. Holistic psychotherapies seek to bring balance between mind, body and spirit with respect to each person's innate ability to heal. As with all psychotherapy, the primary focus is the treatment of psychological and emotional pain that manifests in a psychiatric condition. It is the way in which holistic psychotherapies treat these disorders that mark their departure from conventional approaches. In a general sense, traditional psychotherapy focuses on thoughts and behaviors that are problematic, then interprets underlining meaning of these thoughts and behaviors and offers solutions that are practiced by the client as circumstances warrant. In contrast, holistic psychotherapies foster growth and healing by attending to the synergistic relationship between all the ways we experience ourselves in the world; emotionally, physically, and spiritually. Holistic psychotherapists support balance and healthy interaction between the processes of the thinking mind, the feeling body, and the esoteric spirit to bring growth and healing. Holistic psychotherapies are based in preventive medicine. Like any other psychotherapist, the holistic practitioner has the expertise to help individuals, couples, and families identify the source of psychological disturbance. Of particular importance in holistic approaches is the notion of providing guidance on how to develop preventive skills to protect against illness. Holistic psychotherapies are not an eclectic mix of techniques learned in weekend workshops. They are a conscious and skillful blending of Eastern and Western methods of healing that safely support and encourage all ways of experiencing life. To some degree, it is a matter of opinion as to which types of psychotherapy are considered holistic. Below are examples of some of the better known holistic branches of psychology. There are many other types of psychotherapy that have a holistic approach in addition to these. Moreover, there are numerous methods that are useful holistic interventions, such as dance therapy, music therapy, and hypnotherapy. These\u2014and other complementary approaches to psychotherapy\u2014are discussed in the upcoming chapters. Body-oriented Psychotherapy Body-oriented psychotherapy, sometimes referred to as somatic psychotherapy, is an interdisciplinary field involving therapeutic and holistic approaches to the body, somatic experience, and the embodied self. Body-oriented psychotherapy is based in psychological, developmental, medical, neurological, social and cultural sciences. Although touch is considered a part of the therapy, it is not the main focus. The psychotherapist emphasizes the reciprocal relationships within body and mind and their underlying meaning. Examples of body-oriented psychotherapies include Hakomi, bioenergetics, and relational somatics. Body-oriented psychotherapists believe that psychological, social, and cultural forces encourage the fragmentation of mind-body unity, leading to stress that affects an individual's mental, biological, and relational health. The therapist seeks to join and balance these elements. Humanistic Psychotherapy Humanistic psychology supports the belief that humans, as individuals, are unique beings and should be recognized and treated as such. Humanistic psychotherapy looks at values, intentions and meaning as elements that are in concert with the person's conscious existence. Humanistic psychology holds a hopeful, constructive view of human beings and their capacity to be self-determining. Among the basic determinants of human behavior, intentionality and ethical values are considered strong psychological forces. Humanistic psychotherapy focuses on enhancing human qualities as a matter of choice, creativity, and the interaction of the body, mind and spirit. In this capacity, the individual is free to become more aware, responsible, life-affirming and trustworthy. Buddhist Contemplative Psychotherapy Buddhist contemplative psychotherapy is a process of uncovering consciousness in the form of a fully awake and aware state. Similarly to humanistic psychology, the Buddhist approach to psychology is based on the notion that human beings are fundamentally good. Buddhist contemplative psychotherapy combines the mindfulness practices and principles of Buddhist psychology with contemporary Western psychology. From the contemplative point of view, human nature is intrinsically healthy, but awareness tends to be obscured. Through psychotherapy, the client becomes liberated from unnecessary suffering through experiencing and accepting themselves in the moment, exactly as they are. Transpersonal Psychotherapy Transpersonal psychotherapy stems from a branch of psychology that is concerned with the study of states and processes during which people experience a deeper sense of who they are, or a sense of greater connectedness with others, nature, and spirituality. Transpersonal psychology is an extension of psychological studies into consciousness, spiritual growth, body-mind therapies and personal transformation. Application of the transpersonal in therapy acknowledges that consciousness and awareness are essential levels of development, and if nurtured and developed can transform an individual's life with more profound self-understanding and fulfillment. Like humanistic psychology, transpersonal theory takes into account the whole person and all aspects of the self, aiming for greater overall health of mind, body and spirit. Complementary and Alternative Therapies The terms alternative or complementary are used to refer to non-traditional methods of diagnosing, preventing, or treating illness. The best known and most widely used are nutritional therapy, herbal medicine, acupuncture, chiropractics and massage. These therapies are used to treat both physical and psychological ailments. Science has drawn a distinction between complementary and alternative methods. Complementary therapies are considered to be methods that are used in conjunction with conventional medicine. An example of a complementary therapy would be the use of aromatherapy after surgery. In contrast, an alternative therapy is used in place of conventional medicine. An example of an alternative therapy would be using St. John's wort to treat depression instead of drug therapy. The term holistic is often used as a catch-phrase for complementary and alternative medicine. A psychotherapist who would be inclined to incorporate complementary and alternative methods of healing, such as nutrition and herbalism, would be holistic in nature. Some holistic psychotherapists combine psychotherapy with naturopathy, a branch of medicine that encourages the use of such therapies. Naturopathy Naturopathy is an approach to wellness that promotes natural methods of healing. Naturopaths may diagnose illness using the same methods as allopathic doctors. However, the two differ greatly when it comes to treatment. Naturopaths tend to avoid conventional methods, such as surgery and drug therapy, unless absolutely necessary. Instead, they rely on alternative treatment approaches that emphasize the restorative powers of nature to help patients, such as diet, supplements, and herbal remedies. Naturopaths are trained to treat and support the whole patient, which includes lifestyle and environmental factors that influence general well-being. Naturopathic medicine has treatment plans for virtually all conditions, both emotional and physiological. Naturopathy is based on the premise of educating patients on how to be responsible for their own health. Naturopaths teach patients about self care and make recommendations with regards to treatment options, both conventional and complementary.\u00b9\u00b9 In addition to nutrition and herbal medicine, naturopaths use other natural therapies, such as fasting, hydrotherapy, and chiropractics. Most naturopaths continually learn about methods, systems, and mechanisms of healing; whether alternative or allopathic, ancient or cutting edge. Many of the practices associated with naturopathy date back centuries. Around 460 B.C., Hippocrates, considered the father of both modern and naturopathic medicine, treated disease with fasting, diet, herbs, hydrotherapy, and other natural therapies.\u00b9\u00b2 Greek physicians who continued these practices included Claudius Galen around 150 A.D.\u00b9\u00b3 Later well-known advocates of naturopathic methods included Philippus Paracelsus, a Swiss physician and astrologer, in the early 1500s,\u00b9 and Samuel Hahnemann, a German physician, who practiced in the late 1700s.\u00b9 Naturopathy was well-accepted in Europe in the 1800s and was first introduced in the United States by German physician Benedict Lust in the 1890s.\u00b9 By the 1920s, it gained popularity and there were thousands of practicing naturopaths throughout the U.S. Within a few short decades, however, conventional medicine and drug therapy came into prominence and naturopathy faded. The tide turned in the 1970s as Americans developed a new appreciation of more natural and less-invasive approaches to medicine. It is difficult to gauge how many naturopaths there are today because while some naturopathic practitioners call themselves naturopaths, others incorporate naturopathy into another practice, such as psychotherapy, nutrition, or chiropractics. Traditionally, naturopaths were physicians, although a large portion of their work was counseling patients on preventative healthcare. As psychotherapy has emerged as a comparatively new practice, many naturopaths have embraced it as a way to better address patient's needs. Naturopathic Psychotherapy By definition, the naturopathic psychotherapist is holistic, treating the individual as a whole person; mind, body and spirit.\u00b9 Essential elements in a naturopathic treatment model include diet, nutrition, exercise, lifestyle and effective support systems. Individuals who adopt a naturopathic approach to emotional problems often become healthy in other areas of life as well. Because naturopathic psychotherapy is holistic, it is concerned with how the mind and body work together to obtain balance. A naturopathic psychotherapist seeks to remove the causes of disease, whether psychological, physiological or environmental. The patient is considered to be composed of a mind, body and spirit that work together in concert. These factors act and react upon each other, producing either health or disease. Just as the naturopathic physician believes that each person has an inherent ability to heal, so does the naturopathic psychotherapist. By combining psychotherapy with naturopathic methods, the naturopathic psychotherapist often uses psychoeducation to teach practices that can help to prevent further problems. The primary focus in naturopathic psychotherapy is to determine the underlying factors that may have predisposed a patient to developing a mental health problem. Genetics, nutrient deficiencies, toxic exposures, physiological disease, and lifestyle are all considered. Thorough evaluation of these factors allows for individualized therapy to address underlying causes. In addition to getting a detailed history, the naturopathic psychotherapist may recommend a physical exam and other laboratory tests. Another goal of naturopathic psychotherapy is to optimize the patient's quality of life. For those undergoing traditional treatments, such as conventional medications, the naturopathic psychotherapist works to reduce or eliminate side effects by recommending diet and lifestyle changes to optimize health and encouraging patients to be active participants in their own care. The Principles of Naturopathic Medicine Traditionally, naturopaths have been considered physicians who counsel patients on a wide variety of health concerns. While naturopaths and various naturopathic organizations have differing perspectives on scope of practice, traditional naturopaths adhere to certain basic principles. The practice of naturopathic medicine was founded on principles formulated over hundreds of years from the observation of health and disease. The principles, which vary in number and definition depending on the naturopath you ask, distinguish naturopathic medicine from other medical approaches by addressing the psychological, physiological and spiritual nature of the person.\u00b9-\u00b2\u00b2 Principles attributed to naturopathy include the following tenets. Nature is a powerful source of healing. This principle is based on the idea of vitalism, which holds that each of us has an innate life force that regulates the repair and regeneration of the mind, body and spirit. The naturopath's role is to facilitate and enhance this process, to act to identify and help remove obstacles to health and recovery. Vitalism can be traced back to Hippocrates, who advanced the idea that nature was the organism that healed the patient.\u00b2\u00b3 In Greek, nature is physis as in physician. Hippocrates saw the physician as a healer who would use nutrition and detoxification as a way to work with nature. Identify the primary cause of disease. The underlying cause or causes of a disease must be properly identified and treated before a person can recover. Symptoms are thought to be an expression of an attempt to heal, and should not necessarily be suppressed by treatment. If the symptoms are treated rather than the cause, a primary diagnostic tool is no longer available. Furthermore, suppressing the symptoms may interfere with the person's natural ability to heal. So unless symptoms are life-threatening or painful, the naturopath will try to find the root of the problem rather than merely treating the symptoms. Treat the whole person. Health and disease are conditions of the entire person, involving a complex interaction of physical, spiritual, emotional, genetic, environmental, and social factors. The naturopath treats the whole person by taking all of these factors into account when developing a treatment plan with a patient. By examining a disorder from all possible angles, the person is restored to health on multiple levels, invigorating health and reducing the chances of relapse. Naturopath as educator. One of the naturopath's principle roles is to educate and encourage the patient to take responsibility for their health, and to be a catalyst for positive and healthful change. The patient, not the naturopath, ultimately designs the treatment plan and accomplishes their healing. By empowering the patient in this manner, the naturopath creates a situation where the patient can make better choices regarding their physical, mental, and spiritual health going forward. Prevention is the ultimate goal. Through education, the naturopath encourages prevention of disease and disorders by promoting habits that create good health. The emphasis is on building health first rather than fighting disease later. The idea is that it's easier and less debilitating to maintain health from the beginning. For example, a naturopath would emphasize the importance of daily exercise, diet and nutritional supplements for someone with a history of depression in order to prevent future relapse. Treat the Whole Person Treating patients in a naturopathic and holistic manner is a practical and effective approach to healthcare. By addressing a patient's psychological, physiological and spiritual nature, it increases their chances of recovery in a practical and cost-effective manner. For example, studies have shown that simple dietary interventions can significantly reduce escalating healthcare costs. In the United States, these rising costs have severe implications for individuals and society as a whole as the cost of healthcare increases and more and more people are without health insurance. Naturopathic medicine and natural methods of healing are cost-effective because they focus on prevention, patient involvement, noninvasive methods and appropriate use of technology. Nutrition therapy alone could save billions. A landmark study released in 2004 at a U.S. congressional hearing found potential cost savings resulting from daily use of calcium and folic acid could save $15 billion in healthcare costs annually.\u00b2 Other dietary research released in 2007 concluded that supplementation with calcium, Vitamin D, folic acid, omega-3 essential fatty acids, and lutein with zeaxaanthin could save more than $24 billion in healthcare costs each year.\u00b2 As people realize there are better ways to heal, more and more are turning complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for healthcare. Consider these statistics: According to the Institute For Health and Healing at California Pacific Medical Center, more than 80 million Americans turn to CAM every year.\u00b2 A Harvard Medical School survey revealed that 68% of adults have used at least one form of CAM therapy.\u00b2 In July of 2000, a study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology reported that at least 69% of cancer patients turn to a CAM therapy, most commonly in combination with conventional treatment.\u00b2 Mind-body interventions constitute a major portion of the overall use of complementary and alternative medicine by the public. In 2002, relaxation techniques, imagery, biofeedback and hypnotherapy were used by more than 30% of the adult U.S. population.\u00b2 At the heart of many complementary and alternative approaches is the belief that the mind, body and spirit have a natural tendency toward equilibrium. Modern medical science has dubbed this natural phenomena homeostasis. Maintaining this internal balance and boosting the body's self-healing powers are crucial to long-term good health and well-being. Sometimes severe illness can overwhelm the homeostatic process, and in these instances modern medicine does its most important work. In the past, the triumphs of medical science have overshadowed traditional ideas of homeostasis, but today many doctors believe that it takes more than drugs or surgery to cope with stress-related ailments and persistent disease. Based on this paradigm shift, the idea of holistic health is becoming increasingly accepted. Because complementary and alternative therapies are frequently requested by patients, the roles of mental health professionals are drastically changing. Whereas a psychotherapist may not have discussed nutrition, herbs or lifestyle habits with a client in the past, it has become more commonplace. Psychiatrists and medical doctors prescribing drugs have had to learn about drug/herb interactions in order to protect their patients. Naturopathic psychotherapists continually address all aspects of a patient's lifestyle, including, diet, nutrition, exercise and self-care, whereas many traditional psychotherapists do not. This begs the question of whether a psychotherapist is enabling poor health habits by not addressing them. For example, what should a psychotherapist tell a depressed diabetic patient with heart disease who never exercises and eats primarily fast foods? Believe it or not, there are two schools of thought on this; the first being that the therapist should stick strictly to psychological issues. The second approach involves discussing with the patient the advantages of exercise and diet with regards to managing depression, diabetes, and heart disease. Even if the patient has heard it all before from a medical doctor, exploring the patient's resistance to change with a psychotherapist seems completely appropriate. One of the cardinal rules in psychotherapy is that the therapist avoid a dual relationship with the client in the way of a secondary relationship, such as a personal or professional relationship. This is entirely different from utilizing other modes of healing in psychotherapy. When combining naturopathic methods (like nutrition and herbal medicine) with psychotherapy, the therapist is integrating naturopathy and nutrition into psychotherapy, just as you would integrate other therapeutic approaches. There are countless other methods that psychotherapists integrate into their practice, from Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) to Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). As mentioned earlier, there are even somatic therapies that incorporate touch called body-oriented psychotherapies.\u00b3,\u00b3\u00b9 There are numerous approaches to healing that are appropriate and useful in psychotherapy when applied with respect to the psychotherapeutic relationship. The blending of naturopathy and psychotherapy is a perfect example of this. Time and time again, research has proven that naturopathic methods, like nutrition, herbs and lifestyle modifications, have a basis in\u2014and positive effect on\u2014mental health, making them completely appropriate for inclusion in the psychotherapeutic process. The only caveat is that the psychotherapist have sufficient training and meet legal guidelines for whatever methods they use in therapy. Conclusion By combining psychotherapy and naturopathy, the best healing methods are at our disposal; including a comprehensive approach to lifestyle interventions and psychoeducation. Learning about how and why we heal is an exciting and fascinating process. Additionally, the knowledge gained can help to prevent further illness in many instances. Scientific research supports the mind-body-spirit approach, showing that physical and psychiatric problems are intrinsically linked.\u00b3\u00b2,\u00b3\u00b3 We now know that good health is a composition of emotional, physical, and spiritual values that must all be considered for the effective treatment of disease. Approaching mental health in this comprehensive manner, we significantly increase our chances of experiencing vibrant and long-lasting health. 2 Nutritional Therapy: Nutrients and Whole Foods as Medicine To create a healthy diet, one needs to understand more than simply food; one needs also to understand one's physical, psychological, and spiritual self. \u2014 GABRIEL COUSENS \u00b9 The influence of diet in causing and preventing physiological and psychological disorders is well established, as is the importance of vitamins, minerals and other nutrients in maintaining health. Nutritionists go one step further by using diet and nutritional supplements to treat and prevent illness. They look for nutritional deficiencies, food allergies and intolerances, and for lifestyle and environmental factors that disturb the digestion and the full absorption of nutrients. Food intolerances and allergies can contribute to a wide range of mental health problems, including depression,\u00b2 chronic fatigue,\u00b2 substance abuse,\u00b2 and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.\u00b3 Highly processed junk foods, deficient in essential vitamins and minerals and high in refined sugar, salt, fats, and chemical additives, negatively impact physical and psychological well-being. In addition, even those who eat a balanced diet and have an otherwise healthy metabolism, can be adversely affected by environmental toxins. Industrialization, traffic pollution, and the use of pesticides result in food that contains excessive levels of heavy metals, namely lead, cadmium, mercury, and aluminum, all of which have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including dementia, Alzheimer's disease, autism, and schizophrenia. Scientific research has proven that good health is directly related to the quality of food eaten, and that inadequate diet negatively affects mood and even hastens aging. The source of our nutrition has become critical as crops grown in poor soil lack essential micronutrients, yet are abundant in toxic chemicals. Meanwhile, antibiotics and hormones fed to livestock find their way into our food chain. Getting what we need from our food isn't as easy as it used to be. The Effects of Nutrition To function, the body must have a balance of all the essential nutrients; proteins, carbohydrates, fats and oils, minerals, vitamins, and water. Improper diet and nutrition eventually result in an increase of blood acidity and deterioration of body's metabolic mechanisms. This leads to fatigue, insomnia, mild depression, and anxiety. Physical problems at this stage are generally limited to a lowered immune system, weakness, and headaches. Initially, the symptoms are minor, but tend to get more serious over an extended period of time. As health issues get more severe, depression and anxiety tend to worsen. More serious physical health problems may develop, such as constipation, digestive problems, fatigue, skin problems, hormone imbalance, and anemia. Food intolerances and allergies place additional strain on the mind and body. The toxic overload created by food allergies upsets the body's homeostatic processes by overtaxing the liver and kidneys, the organs responsible for detoxification and elimination. When nutrition and general health is not improved, the onset of life-threatening health problems occurs, including major depression, anxiety disorders, dementia, heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, and cancer.-\u00b9\u00b9 This kind of progression is not part of the normal aging process. Many diseases can be prevented with a change in diet and proper nutrition. When needed, nutritional therapy has been shown to be health promoting, providing that the outcomes are carefully monitored.\u00b9\u00b2 Nutritional therapy has evolved over the years into a scientific and comprehensive healthcare system that can prevent and restore balance when illness occurs. Many chronic long-term conditions that have not responded to conventional treatment are the result of underlying biochemical imbalances that respond well to nutritional therapy. For many people, environmental factors and nutritional deficiencies are so serious that dietary adjustments alone may be insufficient. In these instances, high doses of vitamins and minerals\u2014well above the accepted recommended daily levels\u2014may be needed. In order to determine appropriate dosages, a nutritionist or physician will order the appropriate tests and carefully monitor progress. There are numerous situations that call for nutritional supplements. Anyone who has stress needs to have extras nutrients to reduce oxidative damage. This includes not only pregnant women and older adults, but anyone who is under stress from work, personal issues, and physical exercise. As you can see, this accounts to most of us. In addition to the stress factor, some people don't receive all of the nutrients they need from their diet because they either can't or don't eat a variety of healthy foods. Vegetarians, for example, eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, but tend to lack certain nutrients, such as vitamin D and B12, as well as iodine and iron.\u00b9\u00b3 For people on restrictive diets, dietary supplements can provide vitamins and minerals that their diets sometimes can't. Even for people who aren't suffering from stress, illness, or any other type of disorder, nutritional therapy can be a good way to help preserve good health. How Nutritional Therapy Works Nutritional therapy is a system of healing based on the belief that food and nutrients provide the medicine to obtain and maintain a state of health. Although some mental health problems require medical intervention, many conditions can be relieved effectively with nutritional therapy. Like other healthcare professionals, those who work in the area of nutrition use special tools. The therapeutic tools a nutritional therapist uses include: Using scientific diagnostic tests through professional laboratories Identifying and countering food intolerances Correcting nutritional deficiencies or excesses Improving digestion and the absorption of nutrients Devising individually tailored supplement and dietary regimes Encouraging good life-long dietary and lifestyle habits Creating individual weight management programs One of the tenets to nutritional therapy is that nutrition influences all aspects of life. Nutrition affects a person's emotional state, happiness, overall health, physical appearance, and even relationships. Specific nutrients have balancing and restorative effects that should be taken into consideration when planning a healthy diet. Moreover, a healthful diet includes eating the most natural food available because overly processed food contains little of its original nutritional value and a host of unhealthy additives. Scientists are finding that nutrients must be in exact measurement to one another do their best work. Lack of a certain nutrient will lead to deficiency in others. For example, insufficiency of vitamins D and K will result in the blood's inability to absorb vitamins A and E. Because nutrients act in concert with one another, it's wise to see a nutritionist for a thorough evaluation. Nutritional therapy takes into consideration the three distinct stages of disease; warning, resistance and exhaustion. Adequate nutrition is required at all three stages. A qualified mental health professional or physician should treat any disease, but if your nutrition level is improved, your health can be restored at a faster rate, and nutrients can minimize the side effects of drugs if they're needed. Nutritional Therapy Testing Over the years, many tests have been developed to access the nutrient levels in blood, saliva, urine and hair. Nutritionists and other healthcare professionals use these tests to gather information for diagnosis and treatment purposes. Testing is important; particularly to look for nutrient deficiencies and to make sure nutrient levels are not too high. Tests that are useful in the treatment of mental health include the following. Food intolerance tests. Food allergies and intolerances have been linked to a variety of mental illnesses, including autism,\u00b9 ADHD,\u00b9 and schizophrenia.\u00b9 After determining the offending foods, specific diet modifications are made and health is restored. The most common tests for food allergies are a histamine level test and the Food Allergy and Chemical Sensitivity/Intolerance Test (ALCAT). Homocysteine level tests. Homocysteine, a harmful amino acid, has been associated with depression,\u00b9 Alzheimer's,\u00b9 dementia,\u00b9 and anxiety disorders.\u00b9 The regulation and lowering of homocysteine levels can attenuate these problems. Heavy metal level tests. Heavy metals have been implicated in a variety of neurodegenerative mental illnesses, including autism,\u00b2 ADHD,\u00b2 Alzheimer's,\u00b2\u00b9 and Parkinson's.\u00b2\u00b2 Once heavy metals are identified, a treatment plan to eliminate them can be developed and implemented. Amino acid analysis tests. Amino acids are compounds that combine to form protein. When proteins are digested, amino acids are left behind. These are the raw materials used to make neurotransmitters and other substances. Amino acid analysis examines the levels of approximately 40 different amino acids within the body. Results and subsequent treatment can help depression, chronic fatigue, and learning disabilities.\u00b2\u00b3 Miscellaneous tests. There are other tests that a nutritionist may recommend depending on a patient's needs, such as: Comprehensive parasitology profile \u00b2 Adrenal stress profile \u00b2 Osteoporosis risk assessment \u00b2 Bone mineral density test \u00b2 Menopause profile \u00b2 Breast cancer risk profile \u00b2 Lactose intolerance profile \u00b3 Female hormone profile \u00b3\u00b9 When having any type of testing done, whether for nutritional evaluation or other purposes, the results are only as sound as the person interpreting them. Moreover, the healthcare professional developing the treatment plan should have the skill set to be able to diagnosis and treat the problem. The Saliva pH Test The saliva pH test can be done at home after purchasing a pH test kit at a nutritionist's office or a local heath food store. It involves testing your saliva first thing in the morning before putting anything in your mouth. The test is done by wetting a strip of special paper with saliva and then measuring the results, which indicate whether the body is acidic or alkaline. Urine can be tested as well. In its natural state, the body is slightly alkaline. As we age, many people become overly acidic. That's because nearly everything we are exposed to\u2014foods, environmental toxins, even stress\u2014contribute to acidity in the body. Over time, the body can become less efficient at neutralizing acid and go from being in a more or less alkaline state to chronic acidosis. Imbalanced pH affects all cellular activity in the body, leading to the progression of degenerative diseases, like cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, cancer, diabetes, and obesity.\u00b3\u00b2 Imbalanced pH can lead to mental health problems as well, including anxiety, depression, fatigue, and neurodegenerative problems, like cognitive decline. One of the most effective ways to reduce acidity is through diet. For example, most green vegetables alkalize, as do many minerals. All meats are acidic, as is rice, pastas, cheese, soft drinks, coffee, alcohol, condiments, and most sweeteners. If you need to eliminate some of these offending foods from your diet, a nutritionist can help you to find healthy alternatives. The Safety of Supplements According to the 2001 Annual Report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers Toxic Exposure Surveillance System, no one is known to have died from taking vitamins.\u00b3 Nutritional supplements are relatively safe provided they are taken in appropriate dosages. However, just because a supplement is natural doesn't mean it is safe or without any harmful effects. Nutritional supplements have a profound impact on the body and can cause medical problems if not used correctly or if taken in large amounts. For example, large dosages of some vitamins can cause organ damage. In some cases, people have experienced negative effects even though they followed the instructions on the label. Women who are pregnant or nursing need to be especially cautious about using any type of supplements. This caution also applies to children. It is always wise to consult with a healthcare provider prior to taking any supplement, especially if you are taking any medications, whether prescription or over-the-counter. Some nutritional supplements can interact with medications in ways that cause health problems. Even if your healthcare provider does not know about a particular supplement, he or she can access the latest medical guidance on its uses, risks, and interactions. When using nutritional supplements, it's best to do so under the guidance of a professional properly trained in nutrition. This is especially important when treating psychological problems. In such cases, a mental health professional, such as a psychotherapist, should be an ongoing part of a treatment plan that involves continually assessing progress. In the United States, dietary supplements are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the category of food. This means that they do not have to meet the same standards as drugs and over-the-counter medications for proof of safety, effectiveness, and what the FDA calls good manufacturing practices. Different Grades of Supplements Vitamins and other nutritional supplements created for human consumption are made from two different grades of raw materials:\u00b3 1. Pharmaceutical Grade: Meets pharmaceutical standards 2. Food Grade: Meets standards for human consumption The main difference with each grade is quality and purity. During the manufacturing process various substances are added, so no product is 100% pure. Pharmaceutical grade supplements must be in excess of 99% pure without binders, fillers, dyes, or excipients (substances used as diluents for a drug). Food grade supplements do not have to meet these standards are generally cheaper and of lesser quality because of it. Supplements that are food grade vitamins are available over the counter (OTC), whereas pharmaceutical grade are only available through prescription and healthcare professionals. Pharmaceutical grade supplements are formulated to yield a higher degree of bioavailability; the degree to which the nutrient is absorbed into a living system.\u00b3 As these supplements can be absorbed into the body quickly, they improve and enhance well-being rapidly. Supplements with enteric coatings also have increased bioavailability because the pill or capsule doesn't dissolve until it reaches the small intestine. For example, enzymes without enteric coatings are basically ineffective. Enzymes can be easily be destroyed by stomach acids, making them unavailable for metabolism in the bloodstream. The enteric coatings protect the enzymes from being dissolved by these stomach acids until they reach the small intestine where they can be released into the blood. Transportation and storage can have a significant impact on the bioavailability of certain supplements. Like many oils, fish oil processed under high heat conditions, or exposed to heat and light during transportation and storage can easily become rancid, destroying bioavailability. To make sure you're getting the highest quality supplements possible, opt for pharmaceutical grade available through healthcare practitioners. Supplements that are pharmaceutical grade are more rigorously tested for quality and ability to provide consistent results. When you purchase pharmaceutical grade supplements, you can be confident that they've been tested by a third party to confirm that they contain the amount of nutrients the manufacturer professes they contain. Recommended Intake of Nutrients Recommended daily intakes are guidelines for the amount of nutrients that should be included in the diet every day. Standards differ slightly between countries, but the concept is broadly universal. However, the number of calories recommended, or the energy requirement, is a guideline based on averages, and some individuals have very different requirements. Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) levels, which are established by the U.S. Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences, are notoriously low. Scientists have determined that entire populations, such as the elderly, require as much as 200 times the RDA of some nutrients.\u00b3,\u00b3 Clinical studies suggest that all age groups require much larger dosages of nutrients than the set RDA. A 2007 study at Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute concluded that there was ample evidence to suggest that many people have chronically low levels of vitamin D; enough to negatively impact brain development and function.\u00b3 In addition to causing brain dysfunction, vitamin D deficiency can contribute to bone loss and neurodegenerative diseases.\u00b3 In many instances these low doses of nutrients can have serious health consequences. For example, the RDA levels established for vitamin C may be unable to reduce lipid peroxidation.\u00b3 Lipid peroxidation refers to the oxidative degradation of lipids. It is the process whereby free radicals steal electrons from the lipids in cell membranes, resulting in cell damage. Because the RDA levels of some nutrients are significantly lower than what research suggests, having a blood panels to check nutrients levels would be advisable for anyone experiencing health problems. Testing is the only accurate way to know if a nutrient deficiency is present and exactly how much supplementation is needed. The History of Nutritional Therapy Foods have long been valued for their therapeutic properties, but it was Hippocrates who first proclaimed that diet was medicinal. Before the development of modern pharmacology, people looked to foods and plants as a way of maintaining health and curing ills. For centuries, traditional healers have known that foods can have powerful healing effects on mind, body, and spirit. Throughout history, food has played a central role in every major religion and culture. In many religious customs, food is a part of celebration and spirituality. Nutrition has well-established roots in science. French chemist Antoine Lavoisier is credited with being the founding father of modern nutrition for his study of the chemistry of food in the late 1700s.\u00b9 Lavoisier and Pierre Simon Laplace, a physicist, carried out nutrition experiments using a calorimeter designed by Lavoisier to measure the process of combustion. The scientists determined that the body burns fuel in the form of food, which in turn generates energy. Based on this work, scientists would eventually calculate the energy content of various types of food in the diet and determined how many calories humans need daily in order to maintain a healthy weight. In 1747, James Lind, a physician in the British navy, performed the first scientific nutrition experiment with humans, discovering that lime juice saved sailors who had been at sea for years from scurvy, a deadly and painful bleeding disorder.\u00b2 To execute his study, Lind divided the sailors with scurvy into two groups, prescribing each a different remedy. One group received oranges and lemons, while the control group received a mixture of cider, vinegar, and sea water. Within six days, the men who had eaten the oranges and lemons were fit for duty, while the others were still sick. In 1753, Lind published A Treatise of the Scurvy, a book that recounted his nutrition experiments.\u00b3 Lind's experiments sparked interest among researchers at the time. Scientists knew that something in the citrus fruits had cured the debilitating and potentially fatal condition of scurvy, and wanted to know what that substance was. It would be another 150 years before science put a name to it. By the 1830s, more links between specific foods and disease were discovered. For example, it was found that bowing, rickety legs in undernourished children could be treated with cod liver oil and butter. In 1897, Dutch scientist Christiaan Eijkman determined that the disease beriberi resulted from an imbalanced diet\u2014in this case one that relied too heavily on white rice\u2014and that it could be cured by switching to whole-grain rice. As the science of nutrition grew, more links were revealed between the nutritious properties of foods and their role in disease prevention. In the early 1900s, scientists began naming nutrients. In 1912, Cambridge professor Frederick Gowland Hopkins isolated substances in milk that he described as accessory food factors. He hypothesized that, in addition to proteins, fats, and carbohydrates, there were nutrients that were essential for human health. The same year, the Polish scientist Casimir Funk named these substances vital amines, later shortened to vitamins. Vitamin A, found in egg yolk and cod liver oil, was discovered in 1913, and other findings followed. As each vitamin was identified, it was labeled with a letter and given a chemical name reflecting its physical nature. The essential vitamin C within lime juice was identified in 1935, when Albert Szent-Gyorgyi synthesized ascorbic acid and won a Nobel Prize for his efforts. Further discoveries in biochemistry and nutrition led to a greater understanding of the need for a balanced diet and the role of different nutrients. However, it wasn't until the birth of orthomolecular psychiatry that scientists began to take a serious look at the role of nutrition in treating psychiatric disorders. Orthomolecular Psychiatry Nutritional therapy has its roots in orthomolecular medicine. Orthomolecular medicine is the practice of preventing and treating disease with optimal amounts of substances\u2014usually nutrients\u2014that are natural to the body. Orthomolecular psychiatry is a branch of orthomolecular medicine whose proponents believe that dietary supplements and other dietary restrictions can be effective in treating mental illness. The origins of orthomolecular psychiatry can be traced back to as early as 1927, when Paul J. Reiter used a nutrient as a treatment for schizophrenia.\u00b9 Reiter discovered that 23 of his 50 schizophrenic patients improved after injections of manganese. Although many scientists experimented with nutrients and psychiatry in the interim, the term orthomolecular psychiatry was popularized by Linus Pauling in a paper of the same name in 1968.\u00b2 Pauling, winner of two Nobel prizes, referred to the treatment of psychiatric illnesses with substances (such as vitamins, minerals, enzymes, trace elements, and co-enzymes) that are normally present in the body.\u00b3 In orthomolecular psychiatry, high amounts of vitamins are sometimes used, not to correct a deficiency per se, but to create a more optimal biochemical environment. In addition, dietary manipulation, calorie restriction and fasting may be used. According to Pauling, Orthomolecular psychiatry is the achievement and preservation of good mental health by the provision of the optimum molecular environment for the mind, especially the optimum concentrations of substances normally present in the human body, such as the vitamins.\u00b2 Other advocates at the onset of orthomolecular psychiatry included Abram Hoffer, Humphry Osmond and Carl Curt Pfeiffer, all of whom treated psychiatric disorders with nutrition extensively. Orthomolecular psychiatry has been used with most every psychiatric disorder, including schizophrenia, depression, autism and ADHD. Beginning in the early 1950s, Hoffer and Osmond executed over two dozen studies using megadoses of vitamins to treat schizophrenics. Although their research was largely successful it was seen by allopathic doctors as more of a fluke than real science. Mainstream medicine considered orthomolecular psychiatry to be a radical, unproven protocol and the early advocate's work was rejected in 1973 by a panel of the American Psychiatric Association (APA). However, Hoffer and Osmond's research\u2014as well as the work of other orthomolecular proponents\u2014has been verified in tens of thousands of studies over the past 50 years and used in the ongoing treatment of psychiatric and medical conditions. For example, at the annual meeting of the same American Psychiatric Association in 2004, the following research articles were presented and met with great enthusiasm: Nutrition and Psychiatry: A Historical Perspective Omega-3 Essential Acids and Psychiatric Disorders SAMe, Folate, and B12: One-Carbon Metabolism and Depression Psychiatric Applications of Chromium Studies like these are now a normal occurrence at APA meetings and fill the most prestigious medical journals, attesting to the enduring scientific respect for nutrition as a treatment for psychiatric disorders. While some psychiatrists still practice orthomolecular psychiatry, many naturopaths, nutritionists and other health practitioners treat mental health conditions with nutritional therapy, a variation of orthomolecular psychiatry. Like orthomolecular psychiatry, nutritional therapy attempts to treat medical and psychiatric disorders at the cellular level with nutrients. Studies on Nutrients and Health The first recorded nutritional experiment is in the Bible in the Book of Daniel.\u00b9 As the story goes, the king of Babylon captured Daniel and his friends during an invasion of Israel. When the king invited them to eat his rich foods and wine, Daniel and his friends declined. They explained that they preferred vegetables, beans and water in accordance with their Jewish dietary restrictions. The king agreed to allow them their diet on a trial basis. Daniel and his friends ate their diet for 10 days. Afterward, the king compared their health to that of his men who had been on the richer diet of heavy meats and wine. The king concluded that Daniel and his friends appeared healthier and were allowed to continue with their diet. Over the course of time, scientists have continually investigated the effect diet and nutrition have on well-being. By the 20th century, scientists had used nutrition in the treatment of every major psychiatric illness. The following represents a small sample of the large body of research linking diet, nutrients and mental health. Biotin Biotin, also known B7, stimulates the body to produce energy. Dietary research suggests that a substantial number of women develop marginal or subclinical biotin deficiency during normal pregnancy, requiring supplementation.\u00b2 This is significant to mental health as proper prenatal nutrition is thought to help prevent postpartum depression. A deficiency of biotin, and other B vitamins including B6, B9, and B12, can lead to other types of depression as well. In addition, biotin has been shown to help relieve the symptoms of chronic stress and fatigue.\u00b3 Calcium Calcium, the most abundant mineral in our body, is important for the growth and maintenance of bones and teeth, blood clotting, muscle function, hormone secretion and heartbeat regulation. Calcium is especially important for people with a history of eating disorders, smoking, "}
