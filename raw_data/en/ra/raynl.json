International NGOs such as Oxfam have also made the term \"global citizenship\" a central fixture in their outreach efforts and have devel- oped a free curriculum with numerous resources that spans from pre-school to age 19.2 As a concept or an ideal, global citizenship makes great sense. The inhabitants of our globe share a common real estate. Photographed from the International Space Station, disputed borders and territories fit together seamlessly. The March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan and claimed thousands of lives caused the Fukushima Daichi nu-clear plant meltdown. By Spring 2012 3 that resulted in radioactive contamination of por- tions of the US food supply. Global citizenship proponents are correct in their view that we are all interconnected. Many of the aspirations associated with Global Citizenship make sense. Nevertheless, I suspect that I am not alone in feeling uncomfortable with the current usage of the term. One is often left with the impression that an elite, mostly an Anglo-Saxon elite, has emerged, seeing itself as having already achieved \"global citizen\" or \"world citizen\" status. In a 2011 interview, Francis Fukuyama observed that global citizenship's appeal was limited and that it had not \"won over very many converts, apart from fairly narrow elites in fairly rich countries.\" 4 Global citizenship would need to be developed on a foundation of core values. Will global citizens, like the founding fathers of the United States, recognize a Supreme Being as the source of freedom, equality and the pursuit of happiness or should the govern-ment of global citizenship be agnostic on this topic? What happens, however, if this be- comes a key bargaining chip for the inclusion of certain Christian and Muslim societies? What if a compromise on this topic then becomes an obstacle for more secular states such as France and China? To what extent have today's \"global citizens\" grappled with cultural fault lines in their ostensible transcendence of nationality? There are so many issues to address before we can identify ourselves as \"global citizens\" who are prepared to train others to become the same: i Foreword Dr. Thomas J. Ward Some Thoughts on Global Citizenship Thomas J. Ward Dean of the International College x\u0003A constitution will need to define global citizens' views on the powers of the central world government vis-\u00e0-vis those retained by regional governments. x\u0003That constitution will need to specify a delegation of powers for the executive (including the military), legislative, and judiciary branches of government. x\u0003Global citizens will need to articulate the dimensions of sovereignty that states will need to share with a central government or federation headquarters. x\u0003A decision may need to be made on the lingua franca. Should it be English, Chinese or Arabic? How should this be determined? x\u0003A decision will need to be made on the model of political economy that will be adapted. Will the model lean more towards free markets or favor greater government intervention or will this be left to the member states? x\u0003How will the duties of citizenship such as military conscription, payment of taxes and jury duty be delineated? x\u0003Whom could the world coalesce around as the founding father or mother of \"Global Citizenship\" and learn to emulate? Without ever having addressed these issues, some proponents already view global citi- zenship as a de facto reality. It has especially become the assumed status of an emerging cultural elite in the English- speaking world. When I explore the term \"global citizenship\" in other languages and cultures, I don't find the same enthusiasm for the term that one finds in English. When, for example, I do a Google Search on the Spanish term \" ciudano global ,\" most of the top page hits are from organizations which have their headquarters in English-speaking countries or, in one case, on a page that pays tribute to the fact that the Anglo-Saxon world is at the forefront of Global Citizenship. 5 When I did a Google.fr search of the French term \" citoyen global ,\" I found the first page of findings to be either skeptical of the undertaking6 or interested in debating the extent to which the European Union did or did not serve as a laboratory for a future international federation (with a clear focus on the European Union rather than \"global citizenship\").7 Otherwise, I found French translations or adaptations of English language commentary8 on the topic. I have done similar searches in several other European and Asian languages and am in-creasingly convinced that global citizenship remains an Anglo-centric phenomenon. The most vocal supporters of \"global citizenship\" are from the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and other developed English-speaking countries. Granted there is also a residual of individuals from other parts of the world but even they appear to have Journal of Global Development and Peace ii Foreword Dr. Thomas J. Ward Journal of Global Development and Peace iii Foreword Dr. Thomas J. Ward spent a great deal of time in the US or UK. As we move towards a more tightly networked global community, we can expect that policies that have gained acceptance in the United States will continue to face strong re- sistance in other societies. In March 2012 the UN Commission on the Status of Women flatly rejected an effort by the United States delegation to include abortion as a reproduc-tive right. This included strong opposition from the Holy See as well as Catholic and Muslim member states. 9 On March 7, 2012 the United Nations Human Rights Council provided a forum for debate on the need for the humane treatment of gays and yet most Arab and African states staged a walkout, stating that they \"refuse to legitimize same -sex relations.\" 10 How will the proponents of global citizenship respond to religious and cul- tural views that sharply clash with their own? Granted, the United States is the most \"international\" country in the world but progres-sive American or European thought and liberal democracy, which the advocates of global citizenship are quite vocal in supporting, may not \"sell\" as essential underpinnings of global citizenship in the case of East and South Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, or even Mother Russia. Which of the extant values of global citizenship's pro-ponents will need to be trimmed in order to have buy-in from other parts of the world? 11 Will proponents be willing to make those compromises? *** Like many of the faculty in the International College in the University of Bridgeport (who don't necessarily share my views on this topic), I have lived, studied and worked on several continents. I am fortunate to have learned to speak a few languages and think that, through my studies and my lived experiences, I have developed a genuine apprecia- tion of a number of religions and cultures in the world; however, I am under no illusion that I am a \"Global Citizen.\" What I have learned from my experiences is that, in approaching any new culture, there are great things to learn and also \"mine fields\" in my own cultural baggage that I must learn to navigate. I have learned better over time about how to survey the landscape when in new territory. Some self-proclaimed global citizens, I fear, may not have done so. There is something to be said about Fukuyama's description of them as \"fairly nar- row elites in fairly rich countries.\" 12 Rather than propagating a na\u00efve, elitist view with excessive western accouterments, edu-cators have a responsibility to help students both to understand their own culture and its value. They must also help students to have the foundation to understand and respect the religious and social traditions that inform the world's cultures. Students must learn the importance of being open to opinions that challenge their views. Even if they cannot concur with positions counter to their own, they should at least be able to digest and ex- plain the countervailing views to others in an objective manner and tone. Students, par- ticularly American students, need to learn to listen to others. Those with whom we differ should at least feel that we understand and appreciate the rationale for their viewpoint. We must learn to be open to a respectful exchange of ideas and positions and recognize that understanding the other is at least as important as agreeing with her. While the Anglo-Saxon tradition has many strengths, it cannot serve as the measure of global citizenship. For now, I recommend a more modest approach for those of us who are educators. In the United States, there is a growing emphasis on so-called STEM edu- cation, highlighting the importance of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathemat-ics. I have no quarrels with this as a partial articulation of education's priorities; however, STEM alone is not enough. Today's American students also need to develop deep knowledge of at least one language and culture besides their own. They should not live under the illusion that, in addition to the right to \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happi-ness,\" they are endowed with \"global citizenship\" because they happen to speak the \"world's language\" and have American values. Students and teachers alike must strive to see the peoples, religions and cultures of the world through a new prism so that we are prepared philosophically, scientifically, linguistically, and, above all, attitudinally to con- tribute to a global conversation about humanity's shared future. If American educators fail to prepare themselves and the next generation with the tools needed for genuine in- tercultural discourse, we may soon discover that there is not as much of a difference be- tween \"global citizens\" and \"ugly Americans\" as some think. This issue of the Journal of Global Development and Peace represents a new experiment in the development of the journal. For the first time, we include both the work of faculty and of students in this edition. I am pleased to include the work of Professor Mohammed Al-Azdee, who recently joined the faculty of the International College. Professor Al-Azdee comes to the University of Bridgeport upon completion of his doctoral studies in com-munications at Indiana University. Originally from Iraq, he has had an impressive career in the field, having worked as a reporter during the Iraq War with Reuters , Newsweek and USA Today . His research in the area of the rise of anti-semitic discourse in post-war Iraq breaks new ground and we appreciate him having chosen to do so in JGLDP. Daulat Jha comes to the University of Bridgeport with a wealth of experience as a researcher in a variety of venues in his home country of Nepal and with the Carter Center in Atlanta. We have been pleased to have him join the University's Global Development and Peace program and are confident that readers will appreciate his research here on the linkage between foreign financial support and good governance.

His countryman, Yuan Cura Zhang, a reporter with Shanghai English television and an alumnus of the Global Development and Peace program provides excellent insights into the growing role that China plays in Latin America. Seray Teleke, also a graduate of the GLDP graduate pro- gram who currently is employed by the University is originally from Turkey and her arti-cle explores the role of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation as a means to further po-litical and economic integration among countries sharing the Black Sea. Seray was one of two University of Bridgeport students who were invited to the Kroc Institute at the Uni-versity of Notre to present on their research in the area of peace and conflict studies. We are fortunate as well to have four additional articles that have been written by stu- dents who are currently enrolled in our graduate program in Global Development and Peace. Two of them, Rebecca Witherington and Kristine LeBlanc recently presented at the Northeast Political Science Association (NPSA) conference in Boston. Kristine is a professional librarian by training who has spent time in Africa and has traveled widely. Rebecca has worked with the Kennedy Center in Bridgeport and, together with Kristine, has explored the issue of water rights in Africa. She has attended briefings at the United Nations and her contribution to this issue of the journal addresses the challenge of AIDS and the trajectory toward realizing this and other Millennium Development Goals in South Africa. Stella Kim has worked in retail and in banking overseas; she has particu- lar helped in the acculturation of Americans in Europe. She has also traveled widely in-cluding in Africa and serves on the Board of a Non-Governmental Organization work-ing to address social and educational needs in Africa. Stella's article here explores the role that regional integration might play in the search for peace in the Democratic Re- public of Congo. Katie Kilroy spent three years as a Peace Corps volunteer in Senegal before joining the Global Development and Peace program. She speaks Wolof, the lingua franca of Senegal, fluently as well as French. This article looks at Rule of Law in Senegal and the challenges that surround. Katie was pleased with the peaceful transition of lead- ership that took place in Senegal this past Spring.

Ward Picture with Paul Bremer: Example of Anti- Semitic Discourse in Post-Saddam Iraq Mohammad Al-Azdee 1 Abstract Many Iraqis perceive the 2003 War and the subsequent U.S. military presence in their country as a plot that has made Israel safer. This study employs a qualitative method of textual analysis to examine anti-Semitism in post-Saddam Iraq. The research displays an example of this discourse by analyzing visual frames embedded in an anti-Semitic pic-ture that has been circulating among Iraqis through e- mail. The picture's Judaic symbol- ism influences anti-Jewish opinions and emotions by stressing specific anti-Semitic val-ues and other considerations, endowing them with greater apparent relevance to the is-sue of Israel and the Iraq War. Biography Mohammed Al-Azdee is an Iraqi assistant professor of mass communication at the University of Bridgeport -Connecticut, USA. His area of interest combines content analysis, media effects, political communication, advanced research methods, and new media technol ogies. His research has been presented at varied academic conferences in the United States, receiving awards from the Association for Educ ation in Journalism and Mass Communication (AEJMC), the Internationa l Communication Association (ICA), the Indiana University (IU) Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism (ISCA), the IU Center for the Study of the Middle East (CSME), and US De- partment of State. Al-Azdee had his PhD and MA in mass communication from the IU School of Journalism -Bloomington. Journal of Global Development and Peace Picture with Paul Bremer: Example of Anti-Semitic Discourse in Post-Saddam Iraq 2 Journal of Global Development and Peace The current research uses a qualitative method of textual analysis to examine vis-ual frames embedded in an anti-Semitic picture that has been circulating among Iraqis through e-mail. The picture em-braces different aspects that deserve a framing-based analysis, and the scope of this study will not be limited only to fac-tors that contribute to the anti-Semitic nature of the photo. Circumstances that Iraqi Jews have been experiencing raise a question about the issue of anti-Semitism in Iraq in its public and official dimen-sions which each seem to be complemen-tary to each other. Some have argued that anti-Semitism in Iraq under the to-talitarian regime of former President Sad-dam Hussein was due to the ideology of the Arab Baath Socialist Party that domi- nated every aspect of the political life in that country prior to 2003; however, anti-Semitism in Iraq has continued past this date because it is fueled not only by poli- tics but also by public sympathy with anti- Jewish emotions and opinions that have been promoting an anti-Semitic discourse in the country. For example, average Iraqis were not allowed to freely use the Internet before the U.S.-led military op-eration in Iraq in 2003; yet, when they have had a climate of freedom and de-mocracy that has been offering them the opportunity of enjoying unlimited access to the World Wide Web, some have used it to advance anti-Semitic agendas that are broadly condemned around the globe. An Overview of Anti-Semitism in Iraq, 1963-2010 When Arab nationalists took power in Iraq in 1963, they imposed severe restric-Introduction: Jews in Iraq Today Barely a dozen members of the 2,600-year -old Jewish community in Baghdad re- main to observe Jewish holidays in the Iraqi capital. Most are afraid to gather; besides, where would they go? Baghdad's only remaining synagogue, a pink and yel-low building with no identifying marks, has been boarded up since it was de-nounced after the war in 2003 as \"the place of the Zionists.\" 1 Most Jews in Baghdad rarely leave their homes at all for fear of being kidnapped or executed. The community of Jews in the Iraqi capital has all but vanished in a land where their heritage recedes back to Abraham of Ur, to Jonah's prophesying to Nineveh, and to Nebuchadnezzar's sending Jews into exile in Iraq. Some of the remaining Iraqi Jews are middle class, including two doctors. Others are poor and unemployed, dependent on handouts; yet, they say they are too old to start a new life somewhere else or to leave their life-long friends behind. 2 It is hard to imagine that the last Jewish wedding in Iraq was held in 1978. 3 Just over half a century ago, Iraq's Jews num-bered more than 130,000. But now in Baghdad, in the city that was once the community's heart, they cannot muster even a minyan, the 10 Jewish men re- quired to perform some of the most im- portant rituals of their faith. They are scared even to publicize their exact num-ber, which was recently estimated at six. That is not enough to read the Torah in public, and too few to recite a proper Kaddish for the dead. 4 Picture with Paul Bremer: Example of Anti-Semitic Discourse in Post-Saddam Iraq 3 Journal of Global Development and Peace ment's comrades. An Iraqi Jew (who later fled the country) wrote in his diaries about the hardships of Jewish life in the early 1970s: \"Ulcers, heart attacks, and breakdowns are increasingly prevalent among the Jews...The dehumanization of the Jewish personality resulting from con-tinuous humiliation and torment...have dragged us down to the lowest level of our physical and mental faculties, and de-prived us of the power to recover.\" 6 As a reaction to international pressures, the Iraqi government in Baghdad secretly allowed most of the remaining Jews to emigrate during the first half of the 1970's, but under further restrictions. Most of Iraq's remaining Jews became too old to leave; however, they were forced by Baathist authorities to hand over more than $200 million worth of the Jewish community's property without compensa-tion. 7 The Iraqi Baathist authority was aware that allowing the Jewish minority to immigrate to Israel would strengthen the \"Zionist Entity,\" as the Baathists call it, but national interests and the need to concentrate on solving internal problems (such as Arab -Kurd tensions that reached the point of open military conflict in 1975) took priority over the party's pan - Arab cause. This balance of interests had been the same since the beginning of the Jewish exodus from Iraq in 1948. 8 The U.S. State Department said that there was no evidence of overt persecution of Jews in Iraq in the early 1990s, but the Iraqi Baathist regime restricted their travel (particularly to Israel) and contacts with Jewish groups abroad. The report noted that 75 Jews fled Iraq between 1986 and tions on the remaining Jews in that coun- try; those were not allowed to sell prop-erty and were forced to carry yellow iden- tification cards. After the Arab defeat in the Six Day War of June 1967, more re-pressive measures were forced on Iraqi Jews: Jewish properties were confiscated, Jewish bank accounts were frozen, Jews were dismissed from public positions, Jewish private businesses were shut down, trading permits of Jews were cancelled and telephones were disconnected, and many Jews were put under house arrest for long periods of time. But persecution peaked under the Baath Party (a faction of Arab nationalist ideol-ogy) that controlled power in Iraq after the July 17, 1968 coup. By the end of that year, a number of Iraqi Jews were arrested upon the discovery of an alleged local spy cell that was composed of Jew-ish businessmen and others. Fourteen men, eleven of them Jews, were hanged in Baghdad's public squares. Other Jews died of torture during interrogation for the same accusation. On January 27, 1969, the Baghdad state-run radio station called on Iraqis to \"come and enjoy the feast.\" Around five hundred thousand men, women, and children responded and danced in the streets before the gallows where the bodies of the hanged Jews swung. The crowds chanted \"Death to Israel\" and \"Death to all traitors.\" This act brought a worldwide public condem- nation that Radio Baghdad dismissed by stating: \"We hanged spies, but the Jews crucified Christ.\" 5 Jews in Iraq remained under constant sur- veillance by the Iraqi Baathist govern-Picture with Paul Bremer: Example of Anti-Semitic Discourse in Post-Saddam Iraq 4 Journal of Global Development and Peace proved the Iraqi Transitional Administra- tive Law (TAL) that emphasized the free-dom of religious belief and practice; 11 however, this supreme law was later su- perseded by the Iraqi-drafted Permanent Constitution that stresses the role of Is-lam. 12 Picture with Paul Bremer This study employs a qualitative method of textual analysis to unveil symbolism and the consequent meanings of visual frames embedded in the picture below, which has been circulating among many Iraqis through e-mail. Four Iraqi politi-cians and one U.S. diplomat appear on the photo. They are (from left to right): Mowaffak al-Rubaie, Paul Bremer, Ah-med al-Chalabi, Abdul-Mahdi: Mowaffak Baqer al-Rubaie Mowaffak al-Rubaie is an Iraqi Shiite politician. He was appointed a member of the Iraqi Governing Council (GC) in July 2003 and was subsequently assigned the position of Iraq's National Security Advisor in April 2004 by the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA). He held this post for its full five years term until 1991 and relocated in Holland, England, or Israel.9 Between 1990 and 2003, Iraq was under UN sanctions for invading Ku- wait and violating subsequent Security Council Resolutions; however, the Iraqi Baathist government continued promot-ing an anti-Semitic message through the state-run media that projected the same old anti-Jewish stereotypes by describing Jews as descendants of monkeys and pigs and worshippers of the infidel tyrant. In 2003, a U.S. led military operation in Iraq toppled the Baath regime, and the party was banned by law. But after living for 40 years in pan-Arab environments, 35 of them under Baathists, only 35 Jews were living in Baghdad in 2004, and by 2006, the community of Jews that once represented one third of the Iraqi capital's population had dropped to below 10, in addition to a handful more in the Iraqi Kurdistan region. 10 Currently, the only synagogue left in Baghdad is closed. It is a crumbling buff-colored building tucked away in an alleyway in what once was Baghdad's main Jewish neighborhood. There are almost no children to be bar or bat-mitzvahed or couples to be married. Although Jews left in the Iraqi capital can practice their religion, they cannot do prayers openly or show Jewish symbols to the public in the No -Baath, No -Saddam Iraq. The U.S. civil authority in Iraq (March 2003 - June 2004) tried to put the coun- try on a different track to achieve a mod-erate state where people comprehend and practically apply the principle of freedom of religion. Ambassador Paul Bremer, who was the head of this authority, ap-Picture with Paul Bremer: Example of Anti-Semitic Discourse in Post-Saddam Iraq Currently, the only syna- gogue left in Baghdad is closed.

He became a GC member after 2003, and then he oc- cupied the position of Iraq's interim oil minister from April to May 2005 and from December 2005 to January 2006, being deputy prime minister from May 2005 until May 2006. Chalabi and his INC failed to win a seat in Parliament in the December 2005 Iraqi elections, and when the cabinet of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki was formed in May 2006, Chal-abi was not awarded a ministerial post. Rather, he continued to supervise the Su- preme National Debaathification Com- mission that he had been in charge of since it was formed in November 2003, when the country was under the authority of U.S. Ambassador Paul Bremer, who was responsible for signing the CPA or- der that established the commission.

The textual analysis in this part of the pa- per focuses on three visual frames of a Jewish nature: Chanukah, Star of David, and Yarmulke. Chanukah Chanukah (or Hanukkah) is the Jewish festival of lights. It is an eight-day cele- bration that begins on the 25th day of the Jewish month of Kislev (the ninth month of the Jewish year, which usually occurs in November/December). Chanukah is one of the best known Jewish holidays and, thus, can serve as a significant Judaic symbol. Chanukah's meaningful historic roots are located in revolution against as- similation and suppression of Judaism. It is a celebration commemorating the mili-tary victory of the Jewish Maccabees over the Seleucid Empire. Chanukah also rec-ognizes the rededication of the Second Temple in 164 B.C. These days, Chanukah appears to be al- most a secular holiday on the Jewish cal- endar. In celebrating Chanukah, Jews light candles on the Menorah (a candela-brum) one at a time for eight nights. On the last day of Chanukah, all the candles are therefore lit. Jewish families observ- ing Chanukah sing chants and recite In the March 2010 parliamentary election, Chalabi and his INC won seats in Iraq's House of Representatives after joining the Iraqi National Alliance (i.e., INA - Shiite bloc). Adnan Muzahim Amin al-Pachachi Adnan al-Pachachi is an Iraqi secular poli-tician of Sunni roots. Pachachi was Iraq's permanent representative to the United Nations (UN) from 1959 to 1965, and minister of foreign affairs from 1965 to 1967. He again served as permanent rep-resentative to the UN from 1967 to 1968. After the Baath Party seized power in Iraq in 1968, Pachachi spent a long pe-riod in exile. Pachachi became a GC member after the 2003 Iraq War, but has not occupied any other post after that. Adil Abdul-Mahdi Adil Abdul-Mahdi is an Iraqi Shiite politi-cian and economist. He was one of the two Vice Presidents of Iraq. He was for- merly a GC member, then finance minis- ter in the interim government. Abdul-Mahdi is a member of the Shiite party Is-lamic Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI). Although the group was long based in neighboring Iran, it holds close ties with both the U.S. and U.S.-backed Iraqi groups that opposed Saddam Hussein. After the March 2010 elections, Abdul- Mahdi was one of the nominees to hold the position of Iraq's prime minister.

I saw officers more than once punishing soldiers for nothing but covering only the upper rear parts of their heads. I heard those officers telling the soldiers not to do what the Zionist enemy does. Years after I was discharged from military ser-vice, I had an interest in knowing more about Islam. Over the period 1996 to 1997, I took classes in a Sunni mosque at the al-Adhamiya neighborhood of Bagh-dad where I heard imams warning other students and those engaged in prayer not to cover only the upper rear parts of their heads because that's what \"dirty Jews\" do, according to their description. Although it is a style in Western cultures that a man displays a sign of respect by removing his hat, in Eastern cultures it is a sign of respect to cover the head. Jews belong to an Eastern culture, and Jewish men have a tradition but not a religious command to cover their heads during prayers to show respect to God. Islam is an eastern religion, just like Judaism. Muslim men are encouraged to cover their heads during prayers as part of their religion's teachings; however, Muslims cover the entire upper part of their heads, while Jews typically cover the upper rear blessings while the candles are being lit. They also have some prepared meals, play games, or exchange gifts. Star of David Intertwined equilateral triangles represent a common symbol even in non-Jewish places, because it is thought that it brings good luck; yet, the Star of David is a sign of evil throughout the Arab and Muslim worlds; Iraq is no exception. I still re- member my first art class in Baghdad when I was in first grade, and how my teacher told the whole class never to try to draw the Star of David in any form unless in a picture that shows an Israeli defeat in battlefields. The Star of David (also known as Magen David or Shield of David) supposedly represents the shape of King David's shield or the logo on it, but there is really no support for this claim in any early rabbinic literature nor in early Jewish documentation. While theories about this symbol are theologically interesting, they are not strongly grounded in historic literature. For example, some explain that the top triangle is directed upward, toward God, and the lower triangle refers downward, toward the real world, while others note that the overlapped triangles are insepara-ble, just like the Jewish people. Some say that the three sides represent the three branches of Jews: Kohanim, Levites, and Israelites, while others argue that there are actually 12 sides (i.e., three exterior and three interior on each triangle) to rep-resent the 12 Jewish tribes. It is true that the Star of David appears occasionally in early Jewish artwork, but it has never Picture with Paul Bremer: Example of Anti-Semitic Discourse in Post-Saddam Iraq 8 Journal of Global Development and Peace while in the March 2010 elections, Chal- abi and his bloc won seats in the Iraqi Parliament as part of the Shiite coalition. In the buildup to the 2003 war on Iraq, Chalabi and his INC provided a major portion of the information on which U.S. intelligence based its evaluation of Sad-dam Hussein, including reports on Weap-ons of Mass Destruction (WMD) and al-leged ties to al-Qaida terrorist organiza-tion. 16 Ahmed al-Chalabi had enjoyed close po-litical and business relationships with members of the U.S. government, includ-ing some of the Pentagon's leading neo-conservatives under the administration of President George W. Bush (2000 -2008). Chalabi had political ties to the Project for the New American Century, in par- ticular to Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle. Chalabi also enjoyed considerable support within the political arena of the United States, even being a special guest of First Lady Laura Bush at the 2004 State of the Union Address. 17 In 2003, a CPA decree issued by Ambas- sador Paul Bremer appointed Chalabi as the director of the Supreme National De-baathification Commission in Iraq. The Baath Party, whose name means \"rebirth,\" was founded in Syria in 1947 and has supported a platform of secular pan-Arab nationalism, socialist economics, and strong opposition to Israel and west- ern influence in the Middle East region. It solidified its power in Iraq in a coup in 1968. Under Saddam Hussein's leader-ship (1979 -2003), the Baath Party became highly militarized. The party functioned somewhat clandestinely, recruiting mem-part only. The yarmulke is the Jewish traditional head covering. It is the most commonly known and recognized symbol of Jewish culture, but actually the one with the least religious significance. The word yarmulke, which is usually pronounced yammica, is Yiddish and comes from a Tartar word meaning skullcap. But some Orthodox and Hasidic rabbis say it comes from the Aramaic words - yerai malka - fear of or respect for The King. The Hebrew word for this head covering is kippah. Why use Jewish Symbols on Chalabi? Although four Iraqi politicians and one U.S. diplomat appear on the picture, the three visual Jewish symbols of Chanukah, Star of David, and Yarmulke have been all put on the image of one Iraqi figure only, Ahmed al-Chalabi, who was specifi- cally selected for this purpose by the photo's modifiers due to his political his-tory and his position on the picture stand-ing next to U.S. Ambassador Paul Bremer. Ahmed al-Chalabi was a vital part of an executive council that represented the umbrella Iraqi opposition group, the Iraqi National Congress (INC), which was cre-ated with U.S. blessings in 1992 with the intention of overthrowing former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein. It is true that the INC received major funding and assistance from the United States, but it never had any real influence in Iraq after the 2003 War. The INC's power gradually diminished until the De-cember 2005 elections when this party failed to win a single seat in Parliament, Picture with Paul Bremer: Example of Anti-Semitic Discourse in Post-Saddam Iraq 9 Journal of Global Development and Peace town of Tikrit and its suburbs.20 Shiite prominence in Iraq after April 9, 2003 was taken by Sunni Arabs as a threatening sign. Iraqi Sunni leaders, whether in suits or clerical robes, objected vigorously to the Shiite revival in Iraq. After the United States began the De-baathification process in governmental institutions, Sunni concerns turned to alienation and anger. 21 Many Sunni Arabs in Iraq have perceived the Debaathifica- tion process as a method designed by the CPA of the neoconservative Paul Bremer to punish Baathists for their anti-Jew and anti-Israel ideologies. They have also seen it as a Desunnification process 22 operated by the Debaathification Commission of Shiite Ahmed al-Chalabi, who had strong ties to neoconservatives as well. The Anti-Semitic Meaning of the Picture: Israel and the US War in Iraq Former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his Baath regime were virulent ene-mies of Jews, Zionism, and of Israel. Saddam called for the destruction of the Jewish State, and he did not hesitate to order his army to launch SCUD missiles to hit Israel in 1991 during the 1st Gulf War. In October, 1973, when Saddam was the Vice President of Iraq, the Iraqi army engaged with the Israeli Defense Army on the Syrian Front during the Yum Kippur War, while the Iraqi Air- force was attacking Israeli targets on the Egyptian Front. The photo analyzed by this research was taken on December 14, 2003, only hours after Saddam was in U.S. custody. Am-bers for small organizational cells in towns, villages, and cities. These cells would report to regional party commit- tees that, in turn, would report to Saddam Hussein. In exchange for providing in-formation and assisting the party, mem-bers were rewarded jobs in state-run com-panies and institutions, the opportunity to study in a university, housing preferences, and increased payments. Teachers, for example, used to receive a bonus equal to 10 times their monthly salary for becom- ing full party members. 18 Ambassador Bremer, the U.S. administra-tor of Iraq from May 12, 2003 to June 28, 2004, issued a sweeping order in May 2003 outlawing the Baath Party and dis-missing all senior members from their governmental posts. In November 2003, Bremer established the Supreme National Debaathification Commission to root out senior Baathists from Iraqi ministries and hear appeals from those who were in the lowest ranks of the party's senior leader-ship. The party's foremost leaders - some 5,000 to 10,000 individuals - were not permitted to appeal their dismissals. Although, theoretically, any Iraqi could join the party, its membership in the final years of the regime was mostly Sunni Arab, as were the party's top ranks. 19 Baathism in Iraq might have been a secu-lar-nationalist ideology on the surface, but in heart it has yet been a Sunni Arab movement. Many Shiites embraced Arab nationalism and some were prominent members in the leadership of the Iraqi Baath Party but by the time the party took full control of power in Iraq in 1968, it was led by a group of Sunnis who be- longed to the tribes of Saddam's home-Picture with Paul Bremer: Example of Anti-Semitic Discourse in Post-Saddam Iraq 10 Journal of Global Development and Peace to satisfy their greater concern about Is- raeli interests. Therefore, the picture points to the Jew- ish community in the U.S. and presumes that neoconservative Jews involved in the buildup to the 2003 Iraq War and its af-termath, such as Richard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz, and Elliot Abrams, no matter how long their distinguished records as American civil servants, are inherently more loyal to Israel than to their own country. Disloyalty is another longstand-ing anti-Semitic stereotype. 25 Thus, the modified photo conveys an incorrect no-tion that unlike other U.S. citizens, Jews in the United States do not function as American individuals trying their best to serve America, but as a group of organ- ized conspirators in the service of Israel and some alleged Jewish goals. 26 Having said this, it seems that some American neoconservative Jewish offi- cials were individually involved in CPA's controversial decisions that have wors-ened the situation in Iraq, and made U.S. efforts in that country look fruitless amid huge sacrifices, such as the decision to dismantle the former Iraqi army. The rise of the Sunni-led insurgency has been blamed on the fact that former Iraqi army officers grew resentful of their loss of status and incomes. This argument is one of the central themes of the post-conflict scene in Iraq. In a detailed written sub- mission to the Chilcot Inquiry (Iraq War Inquiry), Ambassador Paul Bremer dis-missed claims that Saddam Hussein's armed forces could have been used to hold the disintegrating country together, but he admitted that ex-Iraqi officers had bassador Bremer wanted to be sure that the man U.S. troops captured the day be-fore at a farmhouse in ad-Dawr suburb, near Tikrit city, was the former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and not someone else; therefore, Bremer took the four Iraqi politicians: Mowaffak al-Rubaie, Ahmed al-Chalabi, Adnan al-Pachachi, and Adil Abdul-Mahdi to check and con-firm. The four Iraqi statesmen also wanted to assure themselves and their parties that Saddam, not anyone else, had become a prisoner in a U.S. detention center. The photo was taken after the five men met and talked to Saddam in his first day in a cell. I knew this information from my position as an Iraqi journalist covering the War in Iraq for the U.S. press from 2003 to 2007. Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League defines a criterion of three components to detect anti- Semitism: (1) Attributing mysterious power to Jews. (2) Accusing the Jews of disloyalty. (3) Identifying the Jews as a group in the service of Jewish goals. 23 By applying Foxman's criterion of anti - Semitism, this picture's modifiers charge Jews with bringing upon them the U.S. war in Iraq for the interest of Israel, and are therefore projecting anti-Semitism. This allegation attributes mysterious over-arching powers to Jews, much in the tra- dition of the infamous Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion. 24 Jewish symbol- ism added to the photo mediates a claim that American Jews through the neocon-servative movement have somehow de-termined U.S. policy toward Iraq (represented by Ambassador Paul Bremer, a neoconservative but not a Jew) in order Picture with Paul Bremer: Example of Anti-Semitic Discourse in Post-Saddam Iraq 11 Journal of Global Development and Peace understand the world around them after April 2003 are continuously struggling to employ their previous life experience to make sense (i.e., meaning) of their new surroundings. In order to efficiently digest the new po-litical climate in Iraq that has emerged after April 9, 2003, Iraqi individuals tend to categorize information and to interpret it in a meaningful way by applying inter- pretative schemas or primary frameworks of reference, 30 such as those related to Jews, Zionism, and Israel, to their lives, because texts alone do not determine the meaning of these things but rather inter-face with collective memory. 31 Some framing devices are so powerful that a single reference to them suffices to acti- vate certain schemes of interpretation. 32 Therefore, the picture's visual frames of reference influence anti-Jewish opinions and emotions by stressing specific anti- Semitic values and other considerations, endowing them with greater apparent relevance to the issues of Israel and the Iraq War than they might appear to have under an alternative condition. But the outcome of the U.S. war in Iraq is not in the interest of Israel. In a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates (2006 -2011) on July 7, 2010, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ex- pressed concerns about the Jewish State's security once U.S. troops leave Iraq.33 Yet, many people in Iraq perceive that Iraqi politicians who supported the U.S. mili-tary operation in their country in fact have offered a service to Israel by making the Jewish State safer. This perception could be attributed to two reasons: First, caused trouble for coalition forces. \"No doubt some members of the former army may have subsequently joined the insur- gency,\" he said. 27 But on July 20, 2010, The MI5 Former Director General, Eliza Manningham-Buller, delivered an assess-ment of the case for war against Iraq to the Chilcot Inquiry. She revealed that she had been asked by the British govern-ment after the invasion to persuade then-Deputy U.S. Secretary of Defense, Paul Wolfowitz (U.S. official with Jewish roots) to ditch his plan to disband the Iraqi army. She said that she had tried to persuade Wolfowitz not to dissolve the Iraqi army during a visit to New York. When asked whether she had any chance of succeeding, she said: \"Not a hope.\" 28 Who Could Possibly Do It? Texts are neither scientific data nor his- torical documents, but are literally foren- sic evidence, because their material reality allows for the recovery and critical inter-rogation of discursive politics in an em- pirical form. 29 Although the photo was sent to me via email by an Iraqi Sunni Arab, there are other factors in this inves-tigation that confirm that it is more likely that the original picture of the five politi-cians was modified by Sunni Arab(s) who may have had an affiliation with the Baath Party in Iraq. Those who added Judaic symbols to the picture wanted to empha- size the interests achieved by Jews, Zion-ism, and Israel through the U.S. war in Iraq, because this kind of framing effect is one thing that gains them popularity within at least a tangible part of Iraqi so- ciety where individuals who cannot fully Picture with Paul Bremer: Example of Anti-Semitic Discourse in Post-Saddam Iraq 12 Journal of Global Development and Peace States is the only international power to have the trust of both sides. There is no conspiracy in this argument. Instead, there is a sensible and balanced approach to conceive U.S. efforts in the Middle East: support for Israel, support for peace, and support for reform in the Arab world, including Iraq. 36 Is this Picture Representative of Anti-Semitism of Iraqis, and not only Sunni Arab Iraqis? It is hard to accurately judge the represen-tativeness of this picture with respect to current Iraqi public perceptions associ-ated with anti-Semitism, but available evi-dence could help extrapolate a conclusion in this regard. Although the picture was taken on December 14, 2003, it was e- mailed to me in 2010, without any de-tailed information about the producer or production date. In fact, there were even no comments on the message body; yet, throughout the period 2007 -2009, Sunni and Shiite sources sent me at least three e-mail messages with pictures of U.S. Jew- ish soldiers doing prayers in Baghdad, specifically in residential locations of for-mer Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. The sources made different comments on the Jewish soldiers' pictures, most re-markably, \"That's the Real Face of the U.S. Invasion,\" and \"The Zionist Invasion of Iraq.\" The Iraq Media Study - National Audi- ence Analysis on April 21, 2010 shows a growing interest in using the Internet among Iraqis, especially with younger generations; 37 nevertheless, low download speeds and shortages in power supply still the U.S.-led military operation in March 2003 toppled former Iraqi President Sad-dam Hussein and criminalized his pan- Arab Baath Party that called for the anni- hilation of Israel. I still remember that once in 1990, a few months before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Saddam swore to God he would let Iraqi fire eat half of Israel. Second, the U.S. political agenda has always told Iraqis and Arabs in gen-eral that America sponsors Israel's secu- rity. For example, on July 6, 2010, Presi- dent Barack Obama received Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the White House, and said: \"The United States is committed to Israel's security; we are committed to that special bond; and we are going to do what's required to back that up, not just with words but with actions.\" 34 Less than three months before that, on March 9, 2010, Vice President Joseph Biden said from Jerusalem: \"Progress occurs in the Middle East when everyone knows there is simply no space between the United States and Is-rael. There is no space between the United States and Israel when it comes to Israel's security.\" 35 Therefore, Arabs always perceive that the United States of America talks to them with an Israeli plan in the pocket. But this is a wrong perception of U.S.-Israeli relations and American foreign policy in the Middle East region, because America supports Israel for very reasonable rea- sons. In so doing, the United States is not anti pan-Arab or anti-Palestinian; in fact, far from it. Indeed, America has been able to help bring Arab countries, like Egypt and Jordan to peace agree- ments with Israel because the United Picture with Paul Bremer: Example of Anti-Semitic Discourse in Post-Saddam Iraq 13 Journal of Global Development and Peace The same Iraqi Shiite groups have been acting in this way by also supporting the Assad regime in Syria. 38 On September 18, 2010, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad expressed his policy toward Israel by stressing that the Jewish state has no place in the future of the Middle East region. 39 This is not a new position of his toward Israel; in Oc-tober 2005, Ahmadinejad called for wip- ing Israel off the world's map. \"Our dear Imam [i.e., Khomeini, leader of the Is-lamic Revolution of Iran that toppled Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and estab-lished the Islamic Republic of Iran (IRI) in 1979] ordered that the occupying re-gime in al-Quds [i.e., Jerusalem] be wiped off the face of the earth. This was a very wise statement,\" Ahmadinejad said in an anti-Zionism conference. He also de-nounced and threatened any country that approves Israel's right to exist: \"Anyone who would recognize this state [i.e., Is- rael] has put his signature under the de-feat of the Islamic world.\" 40 Ahmadinejad claims that the Holocaust \"is a myth that has been used for 60 years by Zionists to blackmail other countries and justify their crimes in the occupied territories,\" 41 and he is persistent in his verbal attacks on the Jewish State to the extent that he left no doubt his regime has an intent to de-stroy Israel with a military - or nuclear strike when it becomes possible. \"The Zionist regime is a rotten, dried tree that will be eliminated by one storm,\" he said, \"Its existence has harmed the dignity of Islamic nations.\" 42 In 2002, United Press International (UPI) quoted an adviser of the ISCI (then the represent obstacles that face the prospect of reliable Internet service in Iraq. How-ever, it is hard to find a university student in that country that does not have at least one e-mail account. Yet, what this picture represents for the whole of Iraqi society is not about the ability of Iraqis to have access to the Internet, it is about anti-Semitism as an attribute of both Sunni and Shiite communities in Iraq. Although my argument is that it is more likely that the original picture of the five politicians had been modified by Sunni Arab(s), this decision does not relieve Shiite Arabs in Iraq of anti-Semitism. They are anti-Semitic in as much as they repeatedly voted for the same anti-Semitic proxies of the anti-Jewish Iran in Iraq: The Is-lamic Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI) and its armed wing Badr Organization, the Dawa Party, and the Sadr Movement and its Mahdi Army. In fact, when the Israel -Hezbollah War took place in July 2006, the ISCI and its Badr Organization, the Dawa Party, and the Sadr Movement all took the same stance of Iran by sup-porting Hezbollah. Officials of those Iraqi Shiite political blocs put the Israel - Hezbollah War issue at the top of their agendas despite the fact that Iraq was drowning in sectarian violence that took away hundreds of lives every day throughout the 2006 -2007 period. Al- though Iraq has been in need of every cent to rehabilitate its infrastructure, the leaderships of the ISCI, the Dawa Party, and the Sadr Movement financially as-sisted Hezbollah during the war, and news reported that members of the Ma-hdi Army travelled to Lebanon to fight side-by-side with other Hezbollah com- batants against the Israeli Defense Force. Picture with Paul Bremer: Example of Anti-Semitic Discourse in Post-Saddam Iraq 14 Journal of Global Development and Peace the existence of the NC, stressing that \"as far as the NC continues, Iran will find a role for itself in the Iraqi issue.\" 49 Iran practices both religious and political influence on Iraqi Shiites through three clergies: ISCI, the Dawa party, and the Sadr Movement. Moqtada al-Sadr, who currently lives in Qum, Iran, has both re-ligious and political authority over a big faction of Iraqi Shiites (i.e., the Sadrists), but the ISCI and Dawa Party have only political authority over the rest of Shiites in Iraq; yet, they rely on the religious clergy of Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Ali al-Sistani to complete their power by acquir-ing religious aspects. The Iraqi perma-nent constitution, which was drafted after 2003, stresses the crucial role of the Shiite clergy represented by Sistani, who himself is an Iranian. Contrary to what some scholars think, 50&51 Shiite clerics hold influence on their followers in Iraq where there is no wide gap between the clergy and the day-to-day life of average Shiites. Through a compli- cated combination of religion, politics, finance, and violence, Iran has been able to impose its blueprint on both the Shiite community and on the ongoing political process in Iraq since 2003. In the 2005 parliamentary election, the ISCI, Dawa Party, and al-Sadr Movement jointly won 128 seats out of 275 (47%), and in the 2010 election, seats of the three Shiite parties totaled at 159 of 325 (49%). 52 As a continuation of this scheme, while the U.S. administration was busy with the process of pulling out troops from Iraq, in August 2010 Iran appointed Hassan Danaifar as an ambassador to Iraq. Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI) saying that Iran supplied the ISCI with offices and funding for its soldiers in southern Iraq. 43 Another UPI report in January 2003 depicted that ISCI activities are harmonized by the Nasr Command of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, which is the same organiza-tion that is \"responsible for funding and training Hezbollah and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.\" 44 In September 2004, American officials told the Washington Post that after the toppling of Saddam Hussein in March 2003, Iran provided tens of mil-lions of dollars and other material sup-port to a range of Iraqi parties, including the ISCI, the Dawa Party, and Moqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi Army. 45 This arrangement has remained the same until today. Some commentators have said that Iran will exercise substantial influence in Iraq over the long term. 46 They have shared the same perspective that Iran's influence in Iraq would become more effective, es-pecially after the full military withdrawal of the United States from the country in December 2011. Iraqi Kurdish Lawmaker Mahmoud Othman says that Iraq's future has fallen into the hands of the U.S., Iran, and Arab countries. 47 But Iraqi Kurdish Lawmaker Abdilbari Zebari is more spe-cific in saying that Iran will keep activat-ing the National Coalition (i.e., NC = ISCI + Dawa party + al-Sadr Movement) to nominate the prime minister of Iraq from within, describing the Iranian move in this regard as a big and strong effort in order to eliminate any counter U.S. ef-fort. 48 Izat al-Shabandar, a leading Shiite Arab lawmaker of the National Coalition, says that Iranian presence in Iraq relies on Picture with Paul Bremer: Example of Anti-Semitic Discourse in Post-Saddam Iraq 15 Journal of Global Development and Peace Friday of every Ramadan be the al-Quds International Day. \"We need a serious stand with the Palestinian people against the occupying Zionist entity,\" he said. \"The demonstrators condemned the Zi-onist entity's schemes associated with Pal-estine and its capital, the al- Quds,\" he added, illuminating that \"although the demonstration was called for by the ISCI and the Badr Organization, we voluntarily joined it for humanitarian reasons that motivate us to support the Palestinian people who have been in crisis since 1948 [i.e., when Israel was established].\" 54 More Symbolism: Chalabi, the Un-faithful Woman of the Pirate Cowboy Bremer The picture's modifiers put a cowboy hat on Ambassador Paul Bremer's head to highlight his American identity. Just in case some Iraqis are unable to interpret the cowboy hat symbol in this way, the hat was rapped with the American flag to stress the meaning that this figure (Bremer) represents the American Impe- rialism of Uncle Sam. But the photo pre- sents Bremer as a special kind of cowboy in some other ways; he is a pirate cowboy. Bremer in this picture has no guns; in-stead he has pirate style swords. Piracy symbols are globally used to refer to thieves, and adding such symbolism to Ambassador Bremer's image reflects common public perceptions in Iraq that the U.S. military intervention there was for oil. In the photo, Pirate Bremer has six swords: three on each side of his belly to portray the meaning that the United States is using Jewish tools in its opera- tion in Iraq, because this number of Danaifar is a ranking member of the Ira- nian Revolutionary Guard Corps, and has a decades-long relationship with many Iraqi politicians. 53 Some may argue that Iraq is not Iran and that Shiites in Iraq are not the same as Shiites in Iran, and that if the Iranian re-gime has a successful formula to manipu-late the Iranian society, that the same for-mula will not necessarily be successful in Iraq. Regardless, when it comes to the anti-Semitism of elite and average Shiites in both Iran and Iraq, it is clear that they share the same values of hate. There has not been a marjaa taqlid either in Najaf (Iraq) or in Qum (Iran) who tolerated Jews, Zionism, and Israel; therefore, why should we think that their followers could be different? On Friday, September 3, 2010, residents of big Shiite cities in Iraq recognized the Khomeini's al -Quds (i.e., Jerusalem) In- ternational Day by launching demonstra-tions to demand support for the Palestin-ian people. The Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI) and the Badr Organization called for the demonstration under the nose of the Iraqi government, headed by the Dawa Party. \"We joined this peaceful demonstration to demand justice to the Palestinian people in their Jihad against Israel,\" a Shiite demonstrator said. He explained that the demonstrators de- manded to \"encounter the Zionist entity's settlement scheme in the al-Quds, which aims at Judaizing the capital of Muslims [i.e., al- Quds].\" Another demonstrator said that the demonstration is an annual tradition that responds to the call of Imam al-Khomeini in 1979 that the last Picture with Paul Bremer: Example of Anti-Semitic Discourse in Post-Saddam Iraq 16 Journal of Global Development and Peace Although eyeglasses of both Pachachi and Abdul-Mahdi were made big, they were given the shapes of women's eyeglasses as well. In the picture, Ambassador Bremer stands between Chalabi and Rubaie. The modifiers introduced the female symbol of a woman's purse to the image of each of these two Iraqi politicians. In a rela-tionship between a man and a woman in a country like Iraq, the woman is the weaker partner; therefore, by adding women's eyeglasses and pink purses to the images of the four Iraqi politicians, the intention is not to claim they are women, but to stress that they are the weaker part in their relationship with Bremer, or in local Iraqi parlance, they are not \"the men who can say yes and no\" in this relationship. Within a broader inter- pretation, Iraq is the weaker part in its relation with the United States. Iraqis are not interested in having pets in their houses especially when it comes to dogs, because people in Iraq think they are dirty, and Iraqi people are religiously and socially encouraged to keep cats and dogs away. Even when some Iraqis (not more than five percent of households in the best cases) decide to have dogs in their houses for protection, they keep them in house yards and never let them inside. But, in order to stress the mean-ing that Chalabi is not Iraqi, though he is truly an Iraqi man, the photo's modifiers put a small dog in his arms. The dog was used in the photo to convey the meaning that Chalabi does not live up to Iraqi standards or desires. However, the same dog conveys some other meanings. Iraqis interpret the symbol of a dog like the one in the picture as a pet of a rich woman, swords is exactly the same as the number of angles in the David Star, which is an Israeli symbol. In 2008, former speaker of the Iraqi Parliament, Mahmoud al- Mashhadani (Sunni Arab), told Al-Arabiya TV that the U.S. has destroyed Iraq according to an Israeli plan. 55 Excluding Chalabi, whose head cover shows his alleged relationship with Jews, the head covers of the three other Iraqi politicians reveal no affiliation to stress the meaning that they are not only not Iraqis but also rootless, like mercenaries of the U.S. in its war in Iraq. Pachachi and Abdul-Mahdi were given magnified eyeglasses to present the meaning that they are unable to see things correctly and judge them wisely, while Chalabi was given flamboyant party glasses to mediate the meaning that Chalabi is something else than he appears to be. Iran might have been using Chalabi to develop sources of information on U.S. opera- tions in Iraq. Press reports say that Iraqi political leader Ahmed al-Chalabi gave his Iranian contacts information on U.S. ac- quisition of Iranian intelligence codes, 56 but he has repeatedly denied these allega-tions. This argument does not contradict the interpretation of the Jewish symbols on Chalabi, because disloyalty and decep-tion are longstanding anti-Semitic stereo-types. Pirates and cowboys in movies have girls, and those who modified this picture did not miss that point; therefore, they gave the Pirate Cowboy Bremer four women instead of one, because polygamy of up to four women is allowed for men in Iraq under Muslim, tribal, and even civil laws. Picture with Paul Bremer: Example of Anti-Semitic Discourse in Post-Saddam Iraq 17 Journal of Global Development and Peace daic signs in this photo; they merely put them in an endless chain of signification. The picture of the four politicians aims at eliciting specific responses in Iraqi audi- ences with respect to each of the four in-dividuals in the photo, because significant symbolisms implicitly encourage the re-sponses that they arouse, or are supposed to arouse, in the target audience to whom they are addressed. 58 The above photo is an example of the psychological origins of framing effects that explain how different presentations (i.e., framings) of essentially the same is-sue alter people's perceptions and evalua-tions associated with that issue. 59&60 Ex- posure to the Jewish symbols added to this picture makes anti-Semitic Iraqi audi- ences assign greater weights (i.e., cogni- tive preferences) to those frames when making subsequent judgments about the four Iraqi politicians within the contexts of the U.S. war in Iraq and U.S.-Israeli relations. An Iraqi individual perceives the Jewish symbols (i.e., frames) mediated by the picture as important to interpret the Iraq War issue, because they carry val- ues (i.e., meanings) that meet the re-ceiver's anti -Judaic principles; therefore, Iraqi audiences label themselves as anti-Semitic once they choose to employ any of these frames to make meaning of the four Iraqi politicians' relations with the U.S., 61 because representations of things provide models for behavior, and subse- quently, for related identities.62 which serves two purposes: Chalabi is a rich man; yet, he is the weaker side in the relationship with Bremer. Although the picture suggests that Chal-abi is an unfaithful partner of Bremer or the U.S., it portrays Rubaie as a partner but fails to present his unfaithfulness. Rubaie claims that he \"deceived the Americans when he brought them in to topple the regime of Saddam Hussein.\" 57 The photo also tells nothing about the faithfulness of both Pachachi and Abdul-Mahdi in terms of their relations with the United States. Conclusion Textual deconstruction is a method that obtains meaning from a text by focusing on revealing a center. The meaning of a text is dependent on a center represented by a set(s) of binary pairs that communi- cators introduce to the text in order to make meaning rather than being the op-posite. Framers establish a center by making each pair's member dependent on its companion for meaning and, we might say, existence within a context. In all bi-naries, one of the terms is always subordi-nated to the other or both of them are subordinated to each other to mediate global meaning(s). In this specific case study of analyzing the picture shown above, the binary pair is Israel/U.S. within the context of the Iraq War and the Iranian intervention in Iraq. This binary has been framed to provide a guarantee of anti-Semitic symbolism that constantly slips from one Jewish sign to the next.

Abstract The Black Sea Economic Cooperation group is creating a foundation for an area of po- tential economic and political integration for its member countries. Ever since these countries started BSEC, they have had to face many barriers on their way to developing this group. Although these countries are generally all in the same region, their political history and economic situations are very diverse. In addition to this, they do not all have stable relationships between them. This article will focus on how to develop the political and economic integration of the Black Sea region. In order to do that, this article will provide some general information about the Black Sea region. Second, it will give some information about the foundation and operation of the Black Sea Economic Coopera- tion group. Third, it will analyze the obstacles that present themselves through the po- litical and economic integration of the area. Finally, this article will provide recommen-dations for the integration of the region through BSEC. 23 Journal of Global Development and Peace Turkish state after the collapse of the So- viet Union was the creation of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation zone. This paper will focus on Black Sea Eco-nomic Cooperation, which is an impor-tant political and economic integration area for Turkey and other member coun-tries. The goal is to look at the ways in which this cooperation was successful and unsuccessful in terms of the political and economic integration of the member countries, and to recommend steps to in-crease the political and economic integra-tion of that area. In order to do that, this paper will mention the importance of the Black Sea for the countries that border it. Second, it will look at the foundations and goals of the Black Sea Economic Co- operation zone. Third, it will explore how political relationships of the countries af-fect the organization and the challenges that the BSEC is facing. Finally, this pa- per will give suggestions on what can be done to increase the political and eco-nomic integration of the region. The Strategic Importance of the Black Sea The Black Sea carries a heavy strategic importance for the countries that border it. Not only does it have an important role to play for the countries of the region, but it has importance to the European Union as well, since the EU has broad- ened its borders to the shores of the Black Sea with the EU membership of Bulgaria and Romania. Also, the location of the sea is unique since it is on the path to the gas and energy resources of the Caucasus. Turkey is growing as a regional power. For the past few years, Turkey's long run-ning membership process in the Euro- pean Union has affected Turkey's foreign policy agenda. Turkey's focus has since shifted from the West to the Middle East and Africa. This has been especially true under the current government, led by the AKP (Justice and Development Party), which has worked to strengthen its rela-tionships with the Middle East. Because of this, Turkey is playing a key role in the Arab Spring. The current president of Turkey, Abdullah Gul, has indicated in an interview published in the May/June 2012 issue of Foreign Policy magazine that \"Turkey can be a democratic model for the Middle East.\" 1 However, Turkey also has another option it may focus on: the Black Sea Region. The Black Sea is an inland sea between Asia and Southeastern Europe. Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Russia, and Georgia all border this sea. It is con-nected to the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas through the Bosporus and Darda- nelle straits of Turkey, which in turn give Turkey substantial leverage in the region. The Black Sea has also hosted historically important civilizations such as the Byzan-tine Empire. It was a frozen space during the cold war, since all of the countries that border it, except for Turkey were part of the \"Iron Curtain\". Turkey later developed relations with the newly inde- pendent states of the Black Sea region after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Turkey then acted fast in recognizing these countries and bilateral cultural and economic treaties soon followed. 2 One of the most important initiatives of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) towards Political and Economic Integration 24 Journal of Global Development and Peace with direct access to Moscow, the center of Russia. The European Union gained access to the Black Sea with the membership of Roma-nia and Bulgaria in 2007. Immediately, the EU declared that \"the prosperity, stability and security of our neighbors around the Black Sea are of immediate concern to the EU\", continuing by indicating that \"Three EU policies are relevant in this context: the pre-accession process in the case of Turkey, the European Neighbor-hood Policy (with five eastern ENP part-ners also being active in Black Sea coop-eration) and the Strategic Partnership with the Russian Federation.\" 5 Also, the Black Sea area can be considered an im-portant trade route for the EU. Overall, the Black Sea establishes its im-portance in the world with rich natural resources and its strategic location. As indicated in the European Union Black Sea Synergy Report, \"the region is an ex-panding market with great development potential and is an important hub for en- ergy and transport flows.\" 6 The Black Sea Economic Cooperation Zone (BSEC) The Black Sea Economic Cooperation zone was founded on June 25, 1992 in Istanbul, Turkey. The organization is at the centerpiece of a multilateral political and economic initiative that aims to en-sure peace, stability and prosperity in the Black Sea region. The borders of the or-ganization cover the entire Black Sea re-gion and consist of 11 neighboring coun- tries: Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bul-The Caspian Sea, which is an important body of water for the Caspian-Caucasus region, is located between the countries of Central Asia and the regions of the Caucasus and the Black Sea. The Caspian Sea is connected to the Black Sea by the Volga and Don rivers. The Caspian-Caucasus region gives importance to the Black Sea and has received attention be-cause it can be considered a source of oil and natural gas for the world's energy markets. 3 It is worth stressing the strategic impor-tance of the Black Sea for the two biggest countries in the region, Turkey and Rus-sia, and the biggest regional organization, the European Union. As mentioned previously, the sea is im- portant for Turkey, since it is connected to the Aegean and the Mediterranean Seas through the Bosporus and Dardanelles in Turkey. It gives strategic leverage and helps Turkey in having control over the area. Although there are other ways for the Black Sea region countries to access the rest of the world, the cost of usage of the Black Sea is more affordable than that of other available options. Assitionally, Turkey may use the region to present its leadership skills to the \"Western\" world. For Russia, the Black Sea is an important area for keeping Caucasian energy re- sources under control. Other than that, it is a gateway for Russia to have access to the world's other oceans. Also, around 25% of Russian foreign trade is carried out the Black Sea route. 4 Another impor- t a n t a s pe c t fo r Ru ss i a is th a t o f s ec u r i t y . The Black Sea is the only body of water Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) towards Political and Economic Integration 25 Journal of Global Development and Peace mote interstate cooperation in the fields of culture and education.8 Below are the areas of cooperation of BSEC: x\u0003Agriculture x\u0003Banking & x\u0003Energy x\u0003Exchange Data and In- x\u0003Health Care and Pharmaceutics x\u0003Information & Communication Tech-nologies x\u0003Tourism x\u0003Trade & Economic Development x\u0003Transportation9 This cooperation was built out of a com- prehensive institutional structure. It has ministerial councils, a permanent secre-tariat, working groups of senior officials and experts on sectorial topics, a develop-ment bank, a parliamentary assembly and a policy research institute. The decision-making body of the organi- zation is the Council of Ministers of For- eign Affairs. The Council comes together every 6 months in April and October. However, if there is a need for an addi-tional meeting, one or more member states may request one. 10 The Council of Ministers may adopt resolutions, deci-garia, Georgia, Greece, Moldova, Roma- nia, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine. In 2004, Serbia joined the organization. In the member countries, one can see that it is not required to have a direct border to the sea in order to become a member of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation group. However, the applications for membership of Montenegro and the Greek side of Cyprus have been denied. According to the official website of the organization 7: x\u0003\"BSEC covers a geography encom-passing the territories of the Black Sea littoral states, the Balkans and the Caucasus with an area of nearly 20 million square kilometers. The BSEC region is located on two continents; x\u0003BSEC represents a region of 350 mil-lion people with a foreign trade capac- ity of over US$ 300 billion annually; x\u0003After the Persian Gulf region, it is the second-largest source of oil and natu- ral gas along with its rich proven re- serves of minerals and metals; x\u0003It is becoming Europe's major trans-port and energy transfer corridor.\" At the beginning, BSEC was a regional organization based solely on economics, but later on, its scope was broadened and it has been made to include other policy areas. BSEC mostly has locally based con-cerns in mind. For example, it intends to upgrade the transport infrastructure in and around the Black Sea, keep the sea and the inflowing rivers clean, and pro-Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) towards Political and Economic Integration 26 Journal of Global Development and Peace Each subsidiary body has its own specific role, which is assigned to it by the Coun-cil of Ministers. 16 Membership in the organization is not based on having a border on the Black Sea. It is indicated in the Charter that \"The BSEC is open to any State which desires to become a Member and is deemed to be able and willing to fulfill the principles and objectives of the BSEC as set forth in the present Charter.\" 17 Al- though membership is open to any coun-try, it is worth indicating that some mem-ber countries, especially Turkey, are not willing to enlarge the organization, since they believe that it will have a negative effect on the organization and that it will slow down cooperation between the member countries. 18 BSEC also gives countries and other in-ternational organizations observer status depending on their request. The observer status of a given country or international organization is established by the Council of Ministers of Foreign Affairs, and that Council may also choose to suspend or terminate the observer status of any par-ticular group at their will. Currently, the countries and the international organiza-tions which have observer status are: Egypt, Austria, Belarus, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Poland, Slovakia, Tunisia, USA, the Inter- national Black Sea Club, the Energy Char- ter Secretariat, the Black Sea Commis-sions, and the European Union. 19 The European Commission was granted per-manent observer status in June 2007. However, the United States refused their own permanent observer status. There-sions, or recommendations. The decisions and recommendations can be made by a two-thirds majority vote, while resolu- tions only require a simple consensus. 11 It is indicated in the framework of the BSEC objectives that the council shall: x\u0003\"decide on all issues pertaining to the functioning of the BSEC; x\u0003consider all matters submitted by the Subsidiary Organs and to take accord- ingly appropriate decisions; x\u0003take the decisions on membership and observer status; x\u0003adopt and modify the Rules of Proce-dure; x\u0003establish Subsidiary Organs within the BSEC, to assign tasks to them, to de-fine, modify or terminate their man- dates; x\u0003consider any other related matters it may deem appropriate.\"12 The Chairmanship of the organization changes alphabetically between the mem-ber countries every 6 months. The cur-rent Chairman of the organization is Ser- bia. 13 The responsibility of the Chairman is to coordinate the actions of BSEC un-der the existing framework and to control the implementation of the resolutions and decisions by the member countries. 14 Another important organ of the organiza- tion is the Permanent International Secre- tariat, in Istanbul, which carries out the secretarial services of BSEC. The Secre-tariat is under the authority of the Chair-man. 15 Other than that, BSEC maintains 20 dif- ferent subsidiary bodies for its work. Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) towards Political and Economic Integration 27 Journal of Global Development and Peace rates of poverty. Greece is the leading economy in the organization. However, it is well known that Greece has this welfare because of its membership in the EU, and with the crisis that they are facing, their economic situation is also questionable. Russia and Turkey are then left as the leading economies in the region other than Greece. Russia and Azerbaijan seem to have built their economies on the transfer of energy, while Ukraine's economy depends upon low value added heavy industries. 22 Those countries need to diversify their markets for better political and economic integra-tion. Also, the economic crisis that Latin America experienced at the beginning of the 20th century can serve as a lesson to other countries that they should diversify their economy and not only depend on the production of luxury goods. However, being in a transitional process and having distinct economic differences are not the only obstacles to a successful BSEC; the historical and political relationships of member countries also have a big effect on the depth of cooperation between them. One example would be the mem-bership denial of Montenegro. It was mentioned earlier that the membership of Montenegro has been vetoed by the or-ganization. This was an interesting case, because Montenegro was a member of the organization while the country was united with Serbia. Therefore, the applica- tion of Montenegro can be considered as an effort at regaining membership. How-ever, before the application of Montene-gro, another country applied to have membership status: the Republic of Cy- prus. With the application of Cyprus hav-fore, the United States has been granted a renewable observer status.20 Obstacles in the Political and Eco- nomic Integration of BSEC As one can see, the BSEC countries are very diverse. Except for Turkey and Greece, all of these countries are post- Soviet countries that have been in a pe-riod of transition. The transition process makes their economic and political devel- opment harder than that of Turkey and Greece. Other than that, Greece, Bulgaria and Romania are member states of the European Union, and Turkey is a candi-date. The benefits of being a member of the EU have increased the difference be-tween the countries of the BSEC. Those countries are more developed and inte- grated within the global economy. Below is a list of the Gross Domestic Product per capita of these countries in US dollars according to UN Statistics Division evaluation in 2010 21: As one can see, the difference between the more developed member countries of BSEC and the developing member coun-tries is considerable. Moldova, Armenia, Albania and Georgia are all facing high Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) towards Political and Economic Integration Albania $3,677 Armenia $3,031 $5,638 Turkey $10,095 Ukraine $3,03528 Journal of Global Development and Peace always stretched thin because of claims about the Armenian Genocide. This issue is sensitive for both sides. It may not be possible to solve the issue in the short term, but both of these countries may start negotiating and using diplomacy for both their development and the political and economic integration of the region, instead of holding on to their current positions. x\u0003The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict: One of the major areas of instability in the region is in Nagorno-Karabakh. The conflict between Armenia and Azer-baijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh and the military presence of Armenia in the area creates an insecure envi- ronment for BSEC. This conflict not only affects the relationship between Armenia and Azerbaijan, but it also affects relations between Armenia, Turkey and Russia. Turkey is involved in this conflict because of its shared history and culture with Azerbaijan. In the past, Turkey based its diplomatic relationships with Armenia not only on claims of genocide but also on the situation of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. On the other hand, Russia is also involved in the conflict on Arme-nia's side, due to their shared history. This situation puts Turkey and Russia in another conflict as well. Taking positive steps in solving this issue will help the operation of BSEC. x\u0003 x\u0003The Abkhazia and South Ossetia con- flict: The conflict over Abkhazia and South Ossetia negatively affects the relationship between Georgia and ing been vetoed by Turkey, Greece ve- toed the application of Montenegro.23 Another example of history getting in the way of the organization would be the his-torical leadership race between Russia and Turkey in the region. Both of the coun-tries are also competing for the leadership of the organization. So far, Turkey has always been in the leading role in the BSEC, to the displeasure of Russia. An- other reason for Russia to have a dimin- ished interest in the organization is that it was created by the initiative of Turkey. Russia approaches the organization not as a regional development organization, but as an organization that will increase the economic and political development of Turkey. Russia also hesitates cooperating because, in their view, Turkey will be- come the main regional power through the organization, something they could not achieve by themselves. Both Russia and Greece seem to create obstacles when it comes to the creation of decision-making bodies for the discus- sion of political matters through BSEC channels, largely based upon their politi-cal relations with Turkey. 24 There are also important historical issues that need to be solved in the region, in order to have a durable political and eco- nomic integration. Below is a list of the most important issues that need to be ad- dressed in order to take steps towards the political and economic integration of the region: x\u0003The Armenian Genocide issue: The relations of Turkey and Armenia are Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) towards Political and Economic Integration 29 Journal of Global Development and Peace It is a fact that the member countries of BSEC need to solve many major issues in order to reach political and economic in- tegration in the Black Sea region. How- ever, it is not impossible. The countries may start with baby steps while they are trying to solve the other major issues be-tween them in order to continue develop-ing and reach political and economic inte-gration in the region. The first step would be determining ways on how to overcome the extreme poverty of some member countries such as Moldova, Armenia, Albania and Georgia. The member countries should strengthen their economic relations with those coun-tries and guide and support them to de-velop their economies. Upon determining how to develop these countries' econo- mies, another step for BSEC would be the strengthening of preferential trade agreements. Although these countries have trade agreements, the implementa- tion and development of them is equally important. Strong preferential trade agreements would give the necessary background for the third step: the devel- opment of a Free Trade Area. During the creation of BSEC, it was initially foreseen that the organization would lead to a free trade zone, but unfortunately no agenda was set up to reach that goal. 25 If the organization worked systematically and set up time frames to reach its goals, it could be more effective in its efforts towards political and economic integra-tion. It will also be beneficial to have an alternative to the EU in the region for the non-European Union countries. Russia. Their relationship is always tense. Improvement of the relations between them will also help BSEC member countries cooperate. x\u0003Transnistria conflict: This conflict has damaged relations between Russia, Ukraine and Moldova. Ukraine and Russia are still not completely free from feeling the effects of this con-flict. Ukraine and Russia need to im- prove their relations in order to serve their greater needs. Although this rela-tionship is an obstacle for BSEC, these countries may also reverse course and increase their relations through BSEC, thus reducing the damage that is done. The impact of the European Union in the region is both a strength and an obstacle for BSEC. It is a strength because the European Union supports the organiza- tion and has permanent observer status. As a major power in the area, it is impor-tant to have the European Union on one's side. However, it is an obstacle be- cause the priorities of Romania, Bulgaria and Greece are with the EU, and not with BSEC. Besides that, because the EU sees the problems of BSEC, they are also in search of another kind of partnership in the Black Sea region that will work faster than BSEC. BSEC needs to address this issue properly, so that it may overcome these challenges from within in its efforts toward political and economic integration.

He has a PhD in law from Sh anghai International Studies University, and has published numerous articles and commentaries on international politics. He was a colu mnist with United Press International (Asia) from 2007-2010, and he is now a guest researcher at the Centre for Non-traditional Security a nd Peace- ful Development Studies at Zhejiang University, having recently published the book \"Evolution of a World State: Study of the Generation and Transformation of Global Collective Identity.\" with the Guangming Daily Press. Abstract The relationship between China and the U.S. has been described as \"positive, coopera- tive and comprehensive.\" However, apart from limited collaborations during the recent financial crisis, Sino-American relations have experienced troubles on various issues. Such issues include military rehearsals and exercises in the South China Sea, arms sales to Taiwan, the US meeting with the Dalai Lama, appreciation of the Chinese Yuan, the DPRK nuclear issue, web censorship, and other ideological differences. One author in \"The Diplomat\" assumed that the United States and China \"are entering a prolonged period of elevated tensions and more frequent disputes between China and the West \u2014 the 'new normal' in geopolitics\". This article uses the Prospect Theory of political psy- chology, utilizing its tools of risk warning, framing effects, and ingrained mindsets to analyze the relationship between China and the US, with a particular focus on the Asia Pacific region, in order to promote a healthier China-US relationship. Due to limited resources, this paper bases its deductions from other academic works. Journal of Global Development and Peace rowing in the same direction.\"4 Chinese leaders were also regarded as smart, so-phisticated and farsighted; its diplomats were praised as diligent, knowledgeable and smooth. 5 However, in reality there are strong feel- ings that are simmering at the strategic level with regards to the emergence of China as a global power. In contrast to earlier American feelings towards a rising China, the US appears to have become more cautious, if not reluctant, to em-brace a China that plays an active role in global affairs, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. The contrast between pre-vious views and current views can be seen from various reports and papers. A 2005 report by the Rand Corporation explained the Sino-American relationship in posi- tive terms. Because of China's successful globalization, we no longer have such problems. China is no longer a vacuum that sucks the world's great powers into gigantic conflicts. China no longer sponsors insur-While there is much debate about China- US relations within circles of academics and politicians at the official level, both China and the US have agreed to build up a \"positive, cooperative and comprehen-sive relationship\" in the 21st century. 2 Therefore, many have high expectations for the smooth development of China-US relations, or at the very least, they hope to avoid any dire confrontations. However, in the last three years, there have been repeated conflicts and skirmishes between the world's two biggest powers, one being a developed country, and the other, a de-veloping one. These quarrels have ranged across subjects from arm sales to Taiwan, to the Dalai Lama's visit to the US, to the evaluation of the Chinese Yuan, to the North Korean nuclear issue, to web cen- sorship and cyber espionage, and even to ideological debates. One author from \"The Diplomat\" argued that China and the US have entered \"a prolonged period of elevated tensions and more frequent disputes\", leading to a 'new normal' stage in geopolitics.\" 3 These tensions have re- sulted in increasing levels of conflict be- tween the two states, as exemplified by American geopolitical maneuvers, par-ticularly in East Asia. It was not very long ago that phrases like \"Stakeholder,\" \"Group 2,\" and \"staying in the same boat\" were so popular that a vision of \"Chinamerica\" seemed in sight, signifying that the two states were work- ing toward such a scenario. Even in 2009, during her February visit to China, Hillary Clinton remarked, \"We are truly going to rise or fall together. We are in the same boat and thankfully we are A Perspective on the American Strategic Shift in the Asia-Pacific Region 34 35 Journal of Global Development and Peace gue that China's growing economic might would eventually result in its swallowing the US economy. Similarly, a constructiv- ist approach would interpret the US as being afraid of losing value. In a word, regardless of the differing approaches, these theories of international relations are helpful in understanding the status of Sino-US relations. However, it must be noted that states also exist in a geopolitical context and are not isolated atoms operating under an anar-chic international system. States can also be seen as individuals to some extent, act-ing not only with rationality and their own interests in mind, but also with emo-tion, adding a psychological element to their behaviors. 7 Furthermore, rational deductions in many cases fail to provide adequate explanations for a state's foreign policy alignment; some psychological fac-tors or latent reasons may become useful for policy analysis. As such, states can be viewed as persons with psychological mo-tivations. Subject to these assumptions, this article tries to apply Prospect Theory, a unique analytical tool of behavior in in- terpreting the American policy shift with regards to China. This discussion will be divided into three parts. The first part of the paper will pro-vide a brief introduction to the concept of Prospect Theory. It will be followed by bringing out the key ideas of the theory - namely risk warning, framing effects, and ingrained mindsets to be applied to US foreign policy towards China for a deeper analysis. This paper focuses only on the behavioral motivations of the US vis-\u00e0-vis China in the Asia Pacific region, while gencies in Southeast Asia and Africa and Latin America. China no longer seeks to undermine global financial institutions. We obtain benefits from a China that supports stable capitalist de- mocracy in Thailand and the Philippines; that joins the IMF, World Bank, and WTO; and that counsels its neighbors about the benefits of political stability, free trade, and free investment. 6 Such documents made it clear that the US was happier with China's economic devel- opment, with China's capability of playing a bigger role in global affairs, and with the Chinese tendency of using soft power rather than hard power in gaining influ-ences. The current state of growing ten-sions between the two states gives rise to new questions and requires new interpre-tations of facts. Why did Sino-US rela- tions take a U-turn, reversing the \"positive, cooperative and comprehen-sive\" discourse? Why is it that the US now appears to be unwelcoming in en- couraging China to play a leading role as it did before? What were the reasons that made the US change its attitude towards \"deliberately\" confronting Chinese en- gagement in global affairs, particularly in the Asia-Pacific? On the other hand, what measures are to be taken by both sides in order to lessen tensions, to promote healthier bilateral relations, and to en-courage better global governance? There are different perspectives through which the China-US relationship can be looked at, based upon the various theo-ries of International Relations. A realist perspective would argue that a rising China threatens US interests, thereby ne-cessitating a shift in its strategy towards China. A liberalist perspective would ar-A Perspective on the American Strategic Shift in the Asia-Pacific Region Journal of Global Development and Peace of framing, loss aversion, and varying risk propensities to interpretations of foreign policy decision-making. Key components of Prospect Theory have been given a more central role in case studies of for-eign policy decision-making, particularly the Cuban Missile Crisis. After 9/11, such analytical tools flourished as ways of in-terpreting terrorist acts, as well as state reactions. Prospect Theory's central find-ing is that a state's attitude towards risk depends on whether they face losses or gains in relation to their reference point. I. The American Fear of Losing Influ-ence in the Pacific Prospect theory argues that historical les-sons help form cognitive propensities that result from historically painful events, and the lessons learned from them can guide the subjects to deduct a scenario in the future. As such, when China's role in the Asia-Pacific becomes greater than ex- pected, a feeling of being driven out is generated. China's engagement with the Asia-Pacific region, and particularly ASEAN states has experienced historical fluctuations. As far back as the Han dy-nasty (206 BCE- 220 CE), China's rela- tions with the smaller, Southeastern states were based on a system of \"tribute,\" whereby smaller states became more sub-missive to the central kingdom. The trib- ute system flourished in Tang and Song dynasties (960-1127 CE) and peaked dur- ing the Ming (1368-1644 CE) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). Due to the Euro-pean occupation of China, the tribute sys-tem gradually dissolved in the latter part of 19th century. Following civil strife in the 1920s, Japan's occupation of China touching upon other regions as well. The paper will then conclude by making rec-ommendations on how to improve the bilateral relationship between China and the US, which would be beneficial to the world at large. Forces of Prospect Theory for under-standing the US mindset 8 Prospect Theory has become one of the most influential behavioral theories in the social sciences, and was originally related to utilitarian interpretations in economics. It was later developed as a leading alterna-tive to \"expected utility theory,\" particu-larly as a theory of decision-making. It was first formulated by Kahneman and Tversky in 1979, and was overwhelmingly accepted, culminating with the formula- tors being awarded the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics for their theory. Prospect theory posits that individuals evaluate outcomes with respect to deviations from a reference point, rendering it a critical variable in making judgments for decision-making. As such, people give more weight to losses than to comparable gains, so that they are generally more risk-averse with losses than bullish with gains. The hypothesized pattern of loss aversion and the salience of framing one's mindset in such a way have received tentative confir-mation by a series of diverse and robust experimental tests that are now well known in the literature on behavioral de- cision theory, particularly in the field of international relations. Since the 1970s, a handful of international relations scholars, most prominently Robert Jervis, have applied the concepts A Perspective on the American Strategic Shift in the Asia-Pacific Region 36 37 Journal of Global Development and Peace tion, communications and technology, logistics and labor, and in the functioning of a common Asian market. With Chi- nese participation in ASEAN's efforts towards economic integration, China once again won greater popularity within the region. In reality, the ASEAN states benefited from Chinese participation, be-coming immune to falling into depres-sions like those Korea and Japan had ex-perienced earlier. As a result, under the Chinese framework, the relationship be- tween China and the ASEAN states started to flourish, encouraging the Chi-nese to further engage or integrate with those ASEAN states. Amidst the gloomy world economy, Asia's economy experi-enced stable development resulting from China's economic engine. This led the world to believe that China's commit- ment was well-timed and necessary. That said, the Rand Corporation, as mentioned above, highlighted Chinese engagement in global affairs. It was under such circumstances that the US felt a little uneasy over China's aggres- sive \"engagement strategy.\" Contrary to its liberal idea of encouraging the trend of market integration for the expansion of global governance, American approval of Chinese initiatives toward ASEAN states gradually declined. The US felt that it was being driven out or displaced from some US strategic \"front lines\" which was per- ceived as a threat in its fight against com- munism. Actually, in the eyes of most Chinese, such anti-China thought was even apparent in the latter part of Bill Clinton's administration, though it was particularly evident in George W. Bush's administration, when the 9/11 terrorist during the Second World War, and the struggle between Chinese Communists and Nationalists (1946-1949), China be- came unable to engage other states. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, up until the 1990s, China was unable to engage with most of the ASEAN states, except during the period of the Cultural Revolution when Maoism encouraged a wave of exporting commu-nism, even though China was itself eco- nomically in trouble. When the Chinese economy improved in the latter part of 1990s, China tactically adopted an appar-ently altruistic \"good neighbor\" policy, helping its neighbors when they suffered from economic and natural disasters. Prior to that, China had been inwardly minded, looking for \"self -dependence,\" restraining from \"internationalism,\" and avoiding \"transporting revolutions,\" as it had done in Mao's era. 9 When ASEAN countries suffered from financial crises, earthquakes and tsunamis, China came to their immediate aid, while taking the risk of fanning a strong nationalistic fervor in Indonesia, which resulted in criminal acts such as robberies and rapes to which overseas Chinese were exposed in 1998. 10 Since the strong trend of integrated com-mon markets was prevalent in examples such as that of the European Common Market, China was encouraged by inter-national society, including the US, to en- gage with the ASEAN states under the regimes of 10+1 and 10+3, which in- cluded other relevant states like China, Korea, and Japan. Acording to the Chinese interpretation, these mechanisms greatly favored the ASEAN states in the areas of tariff reduc-A Perspective on the American Strategic Shift in the Asia-Pacific Region 38 Journal of Global Development and Peace Asian states during the Cultural Revolu- tion, China deliberately shifted its disen-gagement policy with the ASEAN states, particularly those hostile to it. However, a real change in relations between China and the ASEAN states did not occur until the economic crisis in 1997, before which many ASEAN states were more cautious of China's interference in their sover-eignty. It took no one by surprise when China saved some of those states from bankruptcy. The Chinese strategy was popular and acclaimed both by the af-fected nations and by the international community. However, despite China's \"good neighbor policy,\" relationships remained strained between China and the involved nations due to certain conflicts with those states, particularly in regards to tensions sur-rounding the South China Sea. Similarly, America's economic downturn and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan also contrib- uted to strained relations between Amer-ica and China. In addition to this, there was also a per- ceived threat of China's growing econ-omy being hurtful to America's economy. It was assumed that the US was economi-cally and politically threatened. Thomas Heffner stressed the vulnerability of America's economy when he warned that the American economy was being swal- lowed by the trillions of U.S. dollars of currency reserves that were being held by China. Now with this huge stockpile of money and the leverage it gives them, they are threatening to dump these bonds and our U.S. dollar on the attacks forced the US to change what many Chinese interpreted as a \"hostile policy\" in order to coordinate with China for antiterrorism purposes. Due to the Afghan War and the War in Iraq, America could not address its differences with China, not to mention that it required the help of China to bolster its economy in 2008. Southeast Asia has been one of the most important regions for American foreign policy, similar to the role once played by Latin America during the Cold War. To compete with the Soviet Union and China during the Cold War, America formed strong alliances or rather, quasi-alliances with Asian states by deliberately developing military ties with Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand through several pacts and agreements that were intended to prevent the spread of communism. Known popularly as the \"Domino Ef- fect\", the belief was that if America did not partake in a containment policy, then more communist states would emerge in the region, a thought that resulted in American aggression in Vietnam. Following the end of the Cold War, the confrontational relations between major international players made way for eco-nomic cooperation as the primary tool of satisfying national interests. China adopted an open-door policy in 1979, ending the rhetoric of class struggle and \"exporting Communism,\" putting eco-nomic development at the top of its agenda. To decrease the negative impacts of its revolutionary engagement with Southeast A Perspective on the American Strategic Shift in the Asia-Pacific Region Journal of Global Development and Peace tain its title as the world's paramount power, it must restore its primacy in the region and roll back Chinese influence. 16 In a recent article in Foreign Policy maga- zine, Secretary Clinton revealingly sug-gested that an economically weakened United States can no longer hope to pre-vail in multiple regions simultaneously. \"Over the last 10 years, we have allocated im-mense resources to [Iraq and Afghanistan]. In the next 10 years, we need to be smart and sys- tematic about where we invest time and energy, so that we put ourselves in the best position to sus-tain our leadership [and] secure our interests... One of the most important tasks of American statecraft over the next decade will therefore be to lock in a substantially increased investment - diplomatic, economic, strategic, and otherwise - in the Asia- Pacific region.\" 17 II. Chinese Maritime Strategy Goes Beyond US Expectations, Affecting US National Interests In prospect theory, the term 'reference point' refers to the decision -making or judgment process that takes place when framing a choice. According to the American framing of the issues, the thought is that China is more a nation of the Asian continent than a nation of oceans, which means that they necessarily have a less aggressive policy in protecting their interests in the oceans. As a matter of fact, historically, China has sought a more defensive continental policy rather than an offensive policy, whereby any Chinese readjustment of its strategic posi-tioning may raise suspicions. It is pre-sumed that most scholars hold that Chi- nese maritime strategy should be limited market. If they take this irresponsible action, it would immeasurably devalue the worth of our money, send the cost of goods skyrocketing, and cripple our economy. 11 Thus, a growing feeling of threat was be-ing caused by the Chinese economy. The US also felt that China might manipulate the growing integration of the world mar-ket for its own strategic purposes, whereby China would apply its ideological system within its sphere of influence, like in the past when other nations were pay-ing tribute to the kingdom of China. This would happen to such an extent that the Chinese would be \"pocketing all other finances and resources for the guarantee of [their] own gigantic needs.\" 12 Jervis argues that if state actors cannot auto- matically receive information that corre- sponds to their viewpoints, then they of-ten tend to interpret that information to confirm their views. 13 Framing is a means of political manipula-tion. One can deduce that the U.S. is try-ing to borrow \"historical cre- ate \"collective memory.\" Such a deduc- tion or persuasion would help ASEAN states in recalling the past, therefore con-necting those past events to their present stories. 14 Jervis argues that people always apply historical events to similar scenarios, even when they realize that this will lead to some misperceptions, 15 which often result in self-fulfilled prophecies. The new emphasis on Asia and the con-tainment of China is necessary, one top official insists , because the Asia-Pacific region now constitutes the \"center of gravity\" of world economic activity...If the United States is to re-A Perspective on the American Strategic Shift in the Asia-Pacific Region 39 Journal of Global Development and Peace vestment in anti-ship weapons and ballis- tic missiles could challenge America's pri-mary means of projecting power, and helping allies in the Pacific. Whatever the reason, the US believes that China's mili-tary has become more assertive in Asia, particularly in the South China Sea, and that this assertiveness has caused concern among China's neighbors in the region as well.\" 20 This has gone on to such an ex- tent that Defense Secretary Leon Panetta announced plans to deploy combat ships to Singapore for joint exercises, which he said showed US commitment to the stra-tegically vital Asia-Pacific region. 21 However, China holds that their maritime shift is legitimate and reasonable. China's maritime status is listed as the weakest when compared to its land forces, which is detrimental to its comprehensive ca-pacities for protecting its interests. China holds that with the increasing develop- ment of its economic influence, China should gradually expand its maritime power, so as to guarantee the safety of its sea waters for the protection of its trade and to carry out other missions, in such areas as protecting its vessels and crews from piracy. Furthermore, China is devel- oping new aircraft while conducting more to protecting its land sovereignty, other- wise it could possibly mean that China would seek a more aggressive policy, threatening or challenging the status quo, which goes beyond America's expecta-tions. Therefore, from the Chinese per-spective, America's policy is reminiscent of previous experiences, and particularly those that took place during the Cold War, when risk warnings affected Amer-ica's mindset. As one scholar argued, the architects of China's military transforma- tion have also placed a high priority on the acquisition of so-called shashoujian, or \"assassin's mace\" technologies. While the exact meaning of the term remains elusive, as early as 2004, a Pentagon re-port said that \"assassin's mace\" is used to designate a wide array of technologies that might afford an inferior military an advantage in a conflict with a superior military power. 18 Such reference points or standards may frame the thinking of US elites to believe that China is starting to go beyond US anticipations. For instance, former Secre- tary of Defense Robert Gates and the US military establishment believe that China's military is undergoing a \"strategic shift\" as it moves from a focus on ground forces to a focus on naval and air power. Hillary Clinton argued in July 2010 that \"the peaceful resolution of competing sovereignty claims to the South China Sea is a U.S. 'national interest,' leading Beijing to paint Clinton's words as the U.S. in-serting itself into the region.\" 19 As a consequence, such shifts in China's geopolitical strategy seem to generate more US security concerns. \"China's in-A Perspective on the American Strategic Shift in the Asia-Pacific Region 40 Journal of Global Development and Peace \"premier\" arena to discuss concerns over maritime security, a topic that China has refrained from addressing at international forums. 24 American military and diplomatic backing has emboldened the Philippines to press its territorial claims against China. The U.S. aims to balance China in the region to ensure \"there isn't kind of a big thumb on the scale.\" 25 According to Prospect Theory, the mind-set of loss- aversion results in a person's reluctance to see their investments wasted, and would therefore consider the cost of decline during decision-making, rather than potential for gain. 26 Furthermore, applying the mentality of risk warning, the US concludes that the need for contain- ing China is imminent, whereas during the Cold War, the US successfully ma-nipulated its containment policy with the former Soviet Union and China during the beginning of the formation of the People's Republic of China in terms of using an alliance or quasi-alliance strategy. As a consequence it is not surprising that the US desires to make Taiwan an unsink-able aircraft carrier, so that weapon sales are greatly encouraged and manipulated. 27 Similarly, no one is surprised that since 2011, the United States has conducted a series of military rehearsals with Japan, India, Vietnam, and South Korea, which included close interactions and frequent exercises. In February 2012, the US co-held its largest Cobra Gold rehearsal, where Marines of the 3rd Marine Expedi-tionary Brigade practiced war games with service members from Thailand, the Re-patrols and surveillance activities. China also explains that the development of maritime forces would benefit interna- tional cooperation in instances such as peace-keeping, emergency assistance, and fighting against terrorists. From the Chinese perspective, since the Chinese navy has sent six ships to the Gulf of Aden and Somalia, to Djibouti, Kenya, and Tanzania, to the Seychelles and Bangladesh since 2008 for sea escort and medical care, it can be said that such missions are helpful to build a \"harmonious world\" and a \"harmonious ocean.\" China argues that the Chinese path of peaceful development is a long-term \"strategic choice.\" China is not go-ing to challenge the development of the national defense forces of other nations in order to promote world and regional peace and stability. China has been scorn-ful about increased American military ac- tivity in Asia, saying that it is proof of the \"Cold War mentality\" of Washington. 22 Such a reference point for America makes it obvious that the US intends to strengthen its Asia-Pacific alliance, or at least build a firewall in response to the rise of China. One analyst also proposes that \"the United States should also join Indonesia and Vietnam in protesting China's expansive U -shaped claim of sov- ereignty in the South China Sea. It should follow this protest by deploying an in- creased naval presence in the South China Sea, particularly in the vicinity of the islets occupied by China.\" 23 Thus, before at- tending the 2011 East Asia Summit in In-donesia, US President Barack Obama re- marked that the gathering is the A Perspective on the American Strategic Shift in the Asia-Pacific Region 41 Journal of Global Development and Peace link human rights together with these is- sues in the fight against China.29 Furthermore, the US seems to be engag- ing India to influence Indian relations with China. When President Obama vis-ited India in 2010, he noted during his trip that the relationship between the United States and India is \"one of the de-fining and indispensable partnerships of the 21st century.\" His visit there has helped bring the two countries together on shared interests and has moved the relationship forward significantly. 30 One India expert even predicted that four se-curity arrangements might emerge in Asia in the next four years, therefore calling upon defending the Chinese dominance scenario. 31 III. Positioning Maze: It is important to stop China from Challenging US Hegemony For most American elites, it is a common belief that America's destiny is to main-tain American hegemony as a leader of global affairs. In reality, America's com- prehensive capacity in terms of economy, politics, military, and values make it the only option for guiding the world. Seen in this light, any rivals to US hegemony should be contained. Since cognitively, the US holds that \"seeing is believing,\" the US believes that China is catching up with the US, and as a result, China could overtake the US sooner or later, challeng-ing US power and even its value system. The United States is convinced that China has already challenged the US economy, their military, and their values of freedom, as can be seen by their refusal to imple-public of Korea, the Republic of Singa- pore, Malaysia, the Republic of Indonesia and Japan, along with more than 20 other observing nations. \"Cobra Gold offers us a great opportunity to train alongside the soldiers and Marines of seven other coun-tries within the Asia- Pacific region,\" said U.S. Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Mark A. Brilakis, 3rd MEB commanding general. He stated: \"The multinational training that we conduct will directly support any future operation or contingency that may occur in the region, ranging from hu-manitarian assistance to disaster relief. With this being the 30th iteration of Co-bra Gold, the foundation of support and security that we have built between coun-tries grows stronger every year.\" 28 American anxiety over China's military expansion has helped foster increased pressure from neighboring countries. Ja-pan, Vietnam, the Philippines and other countries are experiencing sea disputes and skirmishes, one after the other, against China over claims in the Spratly Islands. In October 2010, the Japanese Defense Minister met with representa- tives from Vietnam, Indonesia, Australia and Singapore and issued a joint declara-tion that \"the Senkaku Islands (Diaoyu Islands) are a Japanese territory.\" Further-more, Japan adopted an aggressive de-marcation process in the Eastern disputed areas, which the Chinese have since pro- tested. The Asia Weekly reported that Ja- pan was experiencing subtle changes in their political environment and in public opinion, and as one analyst pointed out, Japan's new right-wing organizations ap-pear younger, highly educated and tend to use nationalism and liberal democracy to A Perspective on the American Strategic Shift in the Asia-Pacific Region 42 Journal of Global Development and Peace omy. On the few occasions that he dis- cussed China from a security standpoint, Romney emphasized the need for U.S. military dominance to deal with a poten- tially threatening China with opaque in-tentions. 36 Michael Swaine concluded in his book \"America's Challenge: Engaging a Rising China in the Twenty-First Cen-tury:\" As the world's predominant political, economic, and military force, the United States faces a sig- nificant challenge in responding to China's rising power and influence, especially in Asia. This challenge will require more effective U.S. policies and a reassessment of America's fundamental strategic assumptions and relationships. Conclusion In conclusion, Prospect Theory provides us with a good methodology for inter-preting America's psychology concerning China's emerging influence in Southeast Asia and other areas. However, this does not mean that we can ignore other factors of history, the environment, norms, acci- dents, or even the personality of individu- als or elites, including that of the US President. On the other hand, it is also essential not to single out or separate those psychological variables, since they tend to overlap or mingle with each other. Due to flawed assumptions, America may have relied too much on guesswork. Thus, the logic of \"seeing is believing\" is not without fault. Many misperceptions may be generated, resulting in erroneous judg-ments and actions. On the other hand, it does not mean that all of the blame re- sides with the US. China also needs to ment the sharp appreciation of the Yuan, and their ending the purchase of U.S. Treasury bonds, allowing China \"maximum leeway.\" As such, China is held responsible for America's big deficits. It also rejects radical political reforms, and there have been no releases of dissi-dents. In the next 20 or 30 years, the Chinese economy will override that of the US and the age of America will soon end. 34 In this regard, Paul Kennedy concludes: For a long while, many other nations within the U.S. political orbit accepted, and didn't make a fuss about, the artificiality of the American cur-rency position. But those were closely bound allies - Britain, Japan, Germany, Spain, and South Korea. There seems to be absolutely no indication that today's rising powers - Brazil, South Africa, India - have the same deferential attitude. As for China, well, it will never march to America's tune. 35 This author could not help but think of the late U.S. President Richard Nixon's widespread remark, \"We Americans do not know how to be the world's second, do not even know how to be parallel No.1 with others.\" As such, these fram-ing or reference points of positioning al-ways make the US sensitive to any rising powers, especially if that power is an ex-pansionist China. Building on this as- sumption, maintaining US hegemony and preventing the rise of China are both ra- tional and appropriate risk management. Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate for the 2012 Presidential elections, has articulated a China policy focused primar-ily on economic issues to attack President Obama's handling of the American econ-A Perspective on the American Strategic Shift in the Asia-Pacific Region 43 Journal of Global Development and Peace lenge\" stands out for several reasons. Swaine looks beyond this bilateral rela-tionship and takes into consideration other factors that may lessen US-China tensions. He is confident that growing U.S.-China economic interdependence will reduce the possibly of military con-flict. Swaine also concludes that \"there is little evidence that Beijing is seriously considering altering its current peace and development- oriented grand strategy.\" He is also positive about China's emerg- ing civil society groups and their improve-ment of governance. However, he ac-knowledges that \"the process of attaining U.S. goals within China regarding human rights and democracy is likely to remain incremental.\" The most fundamental pol-icy problem, as Swaine puts it, is to maxi- mize China's cooperation with the United States and with international institutions, and to prevent Chinese actions that could undermine America's vital interests. He concludes that U.S. policy towards China should be \"cooperative engagement bal-anced with hedging.\" 39 Such deduction is true for China as well. As such, China and the United States have to do more with governing this world rather than confronting each other. In a time of international and global sys-tems, only soft power and spiritual forces can mitigate and resolve conflicts. As such, Confucianism and Christianity should work together for eternal peace, setting a universal vision of peace for the world. reflect on its strategy and ways of engag-ing itself with ASEAN states. Some ques-tions for China also demand to be an- swered: How to manage Americas' more aggressive stance towards Asia? Should China take further actions to stop US ini-tiatives? How to make ASEAN a health-ier regime for the prosperity of the Asia Pacific and other regions? Should the European Commission model be fol-lowed for the future of ASEAN? Answering these questions is a challenge that is beyond the scope of this article. However, a psychological analysis of the current state of China may be required. Both the US and China should bear in mind that psychological factors often lead to wars. 37 In this regard, we need to psy- chologize state rationality on one hand, and rationalize psychology on the other. In conclusion, all international actors live in a complex global system where na- tional interests are mingled and over- lapped. Thus, the strong global powers have the responsibility of bringing to-gether systems that cover the interests of all actors regardless of state. Reference points therefore should be established to all human interests, carefully framing one's own security. In a more globalized world, interdependence makes all actors aware and more communicative with each other. As Joseph Nye pointed out: \"Given the issues of financial stability, cyber security and climate change, the two countries have much to gain from working together.\" 38 It is worth mentioning that among the numerous publications on U.S.-China re- lations, Swaine's book \"America's Chal-A Perspective on the American Strategic Shift in the Asia-Pacific Region 44 Journal of Global Development and Peace Case Not Closed 45 Journal of Global Development and Peace www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11- 18/china-philippines-spar-over-sea-claims-as-obama-arrives-for-asean- summit.html x\u0003Kennedy, Paul. \"Marching to different tunes.\" New 26 Novem-ber 2010.

Professor of strategic studies Brahma Chellaney of the New Delhi Policy Research Center holds that in the next few years, Asia might have at least four secu-rity patterns: first, the formation of a China as the core of Asia. China tries to seek a multi-polar world, while the US tries to set up a uni-polar world with a multi-polar pat-tern in Asia. The second scenario assumes that the United States is still the patron of Asia; A third possibility is the formation of the Asian community with a common interest, even though this may pro- duce a number of emerging pow-ers, including Japan, India, Viet-nam, Indonesia and Korea after its reunification. \"One Indian Studies Send-Combat-Ships-Singapore- Exercises?odyssey=nav%7Chead 23. see \"Raul Pedrozo, Foreign Af- fairs, 15 November 2010, quote by IPRIS Digest Vol. 3 No.224, 17 November, philippines-spar-over-sea-claims-as -obama-arrives-for-asean- summit.html 25. http://www.bloomberg.com/ news/2011-11-18/china-philippines-spar-over-sea-claims-as-obama-arrives-for-asean-summit.html 26.

With the development of these two regions, the relationship between China and Latin America seems to have a strong influence, not only on them, but on the world as well. Based on the idea of fos-tering South-South cooperation, this paper notes a breakthrough study of Sino-Latin-American relations, and concludes with recommendations and visions for the future. This paper analyzes the political, economic and cultural aspects that strengthen and chal-lenge the harmonization of this bilateralism. The word \"CHINLAMERICA\" has been proposed to bind the relationship between China and Latin America. This paper focuses on CHINLAMERICAN political and economic relations, as well as the cultural integra- tion of China and Latin America. This paper also illustrates CHINLAMERICA and the balance of world powers, with special attention being paid to the U.S. and China com- bating each other in Latin America. This paper then concludes with findings and pro-poses possible visions of what the future holds for the CHINLAMERICAN relation-ship.

Journal of Global Development and Peace CHINLAMERICA: Challenges and Opportunities for the Future of Sino-Latin-American Relations 52 Journal of Global Development and Peace As one of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, China's increasing influence in Latin America has emerged as a crucial topic in global col- laborative affairs. China was regarded as a lesser nation 40 years ago. Although the PRC was recognized as a legal representa-tive at the United Nations in the 1970s, no one could have predicted that China was on its way to becoming a superpower. When China assumed the role of a re- gional leader in Asia, experts were still unaware of the strength of China in global leadership. Today, China's influ-ence is everywhere, whether in the politi-cal field or economic mode, and as men-tioned above, Latin America is one of the major partner continents for China. The Chinese presence and its effects on Latin America have expanded rapidly during the past several years, and the region's leaders are seeking better understandings and opportunities being presented by China as it assumes a new role as a rising global power. Latin America is a key component for the future of China's economic growth. From Latin America's side, \"In 1995, China was the twelfth largest trading partner with Latin America. Today it is the third, after The relationship between China and Latin -American countries blossomed during the first half of the first decade of the twenty- first century. \"China fever\" 1 gripped the region. Latin-American Presi- dents, ministers and business executives were thrilled to see China and its rapidly growing impact on the world's economy and on Latin America itself. The common explanation for the boom in \"China fe-ver\" was China's own economic eruption and its widening and deepening involve- ment in global affairs. In the current dec-ade, Sino-Latin-American relations have grown at a spectacular pace. Improved political relations were a necessary part of the expansion in economic relations since intergovernmental agreements facilitate economic relations, but the exuberance of the economic boom outpaced the im- provement in political relations. What's more, military or militarily sensitive rela-tions have prompted some U.S. fears in regards to this question. For Latin-American countries, the ex-panded relationship with China has long had substantial and broad domestic politi- cal support. It long precedes the emer-gence of social democratic governments in Latin America during the current dec-ade. \"The political foundations for good Sino-Latin-American relations were set under military dictatorships in Latin- America in the 1970s.\" 2 Thus, Latin America has been ready for the warming of the relationship with China; however, under the condition that China demon-strated the ability to capitalize on such opportunities. CHINLAMERICA: Challenges and Opportunities for th e Future of Sino-Latin-American Relations 53 Journal of Global Development and Peace some $6.5 billion through 2004, that amount represents half of China's foreign investment overseas. China has promised to increase its investments in Latin Amer- ica to $100 billion by 2014, although there is concern that several investment pledges are already showing signs of falling short in Brazil, Argentina, and elsewhere.\" 6 Latin America was once considered the \"backyard\" of the U.S.; however, with the rapid growth of Chinese influence in Latin America, in areas such as politics, economic integration and cultural devel-opment, the U.S. feels concerned in re-gards to China. Indeed, U.S. policymakers have seen some need to respond to Bei-jing's keenest political interest: its effort to establish formal diplomatic ties with the Latin-American countries that now recognize Taiwan and represent nearly half of Taiwan's remaining diplomatic al-lies worldwide. Washington has expressed some concerns about China's activities in the hemisphere, and bilateral tensions threaten to grow over time. There are U.S. officials and members of Congress who now view China as the most serious chal- lenge to U.S. interests in the region since the end of the Cold War \u2014citing concerns about the Panama Canal, the deployment of Chinese peacekeepers in Haiti, and China's support for Cuba's Fidel Castro, as well as Beijing's growing interest in Venezuelan oil. Other U.S. officials, how- ever, believe that economic links with China can play a positive role in helping to build a more prosperous and globally minded Latin America. China's role is now seen as an important agenda item for U.S. policy in Latin America 7. the United States and the European Un- ion. In 2000, reciprocal trade reached $12.2 billion. This figure rose to $107 bil- lion in 2007, and in the first three quar- ters of 2008, [it] totaled $111 billion.\" 3 As explained in a report published by The Economist in 2008, \"Although the PRC remains behind the United States as an energy consumer, China's oil and natural gas consumption has more than quadru-pled over the past 25 years.\" 4 For obvi- ous reasons, the economic growth of China is multifaceted, but one of the cor-nerstones for its competitive develop-ment is the hunger for a reliable supply of commodities. It is important to highlight that Latin America also exports manufac-tured goods to China, but the compara-tive advantage is concentrated in the sup- ply and demand of commodities like soy- beans, copper, crude oil, iron ore, coffee, bananas, and zinc. China's economic engagement in Latin America responds to the requirements of a booming Chinese economy that has been growing at nearly ten percent a year for the past quarter century. Some extra economic figures in regards to China's involvement in Latin America are also impressive. \"In the past six years, Chinese imports from Latin America have grown more than six fold, at a pace of some 60 percent a year, to an estimated $50 billion in 2005.\" 5 China has become a principal consumer of food, mineral, and other pri- mary products from Latin America, prin-cipally benefiting the commodity-producing countries of South America, and particularly Argentina, Brazil, Peru, and Chile. \"While Chinese investment in Latin America remains relatively small at CHINLAMERICA: Challenges and Opportunities for the Future of Sino-Latin-American Relations 54 Journal of Global Development and Peace United States or European countries, such as Spain or Portugal10, there are no historical episodes that can overshadow the relationship. As per the development of China in political stature, cooperation can further Chinese-Latin American inte- gration. Overview of the CHINLAMERICAN Political Status at the Present Stage Both China and Latin America are devel-oping regions. Common benefits, mutual interests, and similar developmental goals have pushed forward collaboration be- tween China and Latin America under the frame of South-South cooperation. There were frequent exchanges of high-profile official visits by the leadership of these regions. Chinese President Hu Jintao has visited Latin America three times in his presidency. Costa Rica, Cuba, Peru, Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Mexico have all wit- nessed President Hu's visit in the past few years. 11 Other standing committee leaders of China, including Chinese Vice Presi-dent Xi Jinping, CPPCC's Chairman Jia Qinglin, 12 former Vice President Zeng Qinghong (and others), have also paid For the sake of this research, emphasis will be placed on the political, economic and cultural relations between China and Latin America. Through a quantitative and qualitative approach, this research attempts to draw recommendations and conclusions for the challenges and oppor-tunities in the future of Sino-Latin-American relations. This research would also like to introduce the word \"CHINLAMERICA\" for the strengthen- ing of the relationship between these two partners, to see if it is possible for China and Latin America to reach a higher and tighter collaboration, and build an \"All - weather Partnership\" 8 in the coming fu- ture. The mentioned word \"CHINLAMERICA\" is inspired by a similar concept introduced by Harvard Professor Niall Ferguson, who presented the term \"CHIMERICA\" as signifying the interdependent relationship between China and United States, based upon the \"puzzling buoyancy of global asset mar- kets in recent years.\" 9 This research also tries to serve as a catalyst for track II dip-lomatic efforts to bond the two regions based on the reinforcement of mutual un- derstandings and under the framework of South-South cooperation. CHINLAMERICAN Political Status Although there are great distance and scant historical contacts between China and Latin America, these two regions have recently become closer than ever. They have allowed political relations be-tween them to flow freely. China's inter-est in the region is not new, but it has in-creased significantly in the last few years. Unlike what has happened with the CHINLAMERICA: Challenges and Opportunities for the Future of Sino-Latin-American Relations Common benefits, mutual interests, and similar devel- oping goals have pushed forward the collaboration between China and Latin America 55 Journal of Global Development and Peace between China and Venezuela. On a dif- ferent scale, a Strategic Partnership was established with Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Peru. China and Chile have also signed agreements to further their rela-tionships into a Comprehensive Partner-ship. In addition to these strategic thoughts, detailed plans and long-term working schedules have been made by the two sides to maintain good bilateral rela-tions. The Expanding Influence of China in Latin America There is no doubt that the expanding vol-ume of trade and investment between China and Latin America is impressive; moreover, the expanding weight of China in the calculations of political leaders, business people, and others in Latin America has undergone a significant transformation. China is influencing that region as much as it can, just as the United States has done for decades. The perception that China is emerging as a key political partner has been the motiva- tion for leaders to take the time and re- sources to accommodate this new reality. The decision by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias to establish diplomatic rela-tions with China in June 2007 14 was moti- vated, in part, by his conviction that posi-tioning his country in line with China's rise was necessary for it to play a positive role in Latin America 15. As mentioned before, the investment of time by Latin-American leaders to promote their coun-tries' commercial and political relation-ship with China through official visits has been similarly impressive. official visits to Latin America, deepening cooperation between the regions during these high-level visits. Both China and Latin America have clear visions of the direction in which CHINLAMERICAN political relations will be moving. China and Latin America look at each other from a strategic per-spective and have made efforts in build-ing the two regions into an all-around comprehensive partnership. Such coop- erative frames have been made and are being perfected. The Chinese Central Government has even issued a white pa-per in November 2008, which treated Latin America as a priority partner in China's development. This official docu-mentation illustrates general goals and specific steps in the development of Sino- Latin-American relations. These new poli-cies and thoughts have earned positive feedback from Latin-American countries. With efforts from both sides, political collaboration between China and Latin America has improved. A Common De- velopment Strategic Partnership has been created between China and Venezuela. On a different scale, a Strategic Partner-ship was established with Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Peru. China and Chile have also signed agreements to further their relationships into a Comprehensive Part- nership. 13 In addition to these strategic thoughts, detailed plans and long-term working schedules have been made by the two sides to maintain good bilateral rela-tions from both sides, political collabora-tion between China and Latin America has improved. A Common Development Strategic Partnership has been created CHINLAMERICA: Challenges and Opportunities for the Future of Sino-Latin-American Relations 56 Journal of Global Development and Peace while simultaneously seeking to boost its sale of goods there to compensate for lost sales to its traditional customers in the United States and Europe, despite the ex- isting controversy of their trade deficit with China. The benefits of China as a consumer of Latin-American goods will lead to long-term expansion and growth. It is likely to strengthen political forces with the social constituency in the re-gion 17. At the same time, if China is able to ef-fectively manage tensions generated by economic conditions, both at home and in Latin America, it may emerge from the crisis with a dramatically stronger position in Latin America. The gradual evapora-tion of western capital from the region has increased the focus of Latin American leaders towards China, since the Chinese government has an announced two tril-lion dollars in foreign currency reserves, which has given it potential liquidity and international investment power. It is im-portant to highlight that the present global economic stagnation has caused a decline in global commodity prices, and the value of the Chinese reserves provides an opportunity for China to invest in the region and acquire mass amounts of com-modities at bargain prices. China's Political Objectives in Latin America Based on the experience and events tak-ing place in CHINLAMERICAN rela-tions, it is not hard to understand that China has certain political objectives in Latin America. First of all, the intent is to counterbalance American hegemony by In the private sector, the calculation of business people that China will be among the most important markets of the future has motivated a wide range of corporate leaders to dedicate significant time and capital to involve them in China, \"even when those companies do not expect to generate a profit from their China opera-tions for years.\" 16 The United States used to play the most important role in Latin America, and the United States even re- gards Latin America as its backyard; how- ever, with the growing influence of China in the region, there have been some shifts of balances between the big nations. Al-though the United States still holds some advantages, China is experiencing super-national treatment in Latin America now as well. Latin-American countries began to realize that it is beneficial to keep up a good relationship with China, in addition to cooperating politically and economi-cally with the Americans. Global Recession and the Rise in CHINLAMERICAN Cooperation The transformation of China's relation- ship with Latin America during the past few years may be seen as an inadequate measure of the rate of change to come. In particular, the deepening global recession, which may bring about financial and po-litical upheaval, can fundamentally trans- form the roles of actors in the interna- tional system, such as China and Latin America. In the short to medium term, the recession is likely to severely strain China's relationship with Latin America. China is likely to increase its purchase of primary products from Latin America, CHINLAMERICA: Challenges and Opportunities for the Future of Sino-Latin-American Relations 57 Journal of Global Development and Peace tent provider of financial assistance and investment in Latin America. The consis-tent corruption in many Latin-American countries that maintain relationships with Taiwan have provided conditions which force Taiwan to continue to provide funding. However, it is now severely pressed to compete against the growing economic and political clout of Mainland China. 22 For example, in 2004, Dominica severed relations with Taipei after Beijing trumped Taipei's $9 million in assistance with a pledge of $122 million in assistance to the tiny country over six years. 23 I n September 2004, China sent a peacekeep-ing mission to Haiti, another of Taipei's official relationships, marking Beijing's first deployment of forces ever in the Western Hemisphere. The PRC's ability to develop and expand contacts with Tai- wan's friends in the region undoubtedly has been facilitated by a decision by the Organization of American States (OAS) on May 26, 2004, to accept China as a formal observer in the OAS 24. The OAS has 35 members, including the United States, with 12 of those countries con- tinuing diplomatic relations with Taiwan rather than the mainland. Meanwhile, Bei-jing has strongly objected to Taiwan's ef-forts to seek OAS observer status. It is an important campaign for Mainland China against Taiwan in Latin America. China has demonstrated a strong desire for countries in Latin America to support a \"One China\" policy and shift diplo-matic recognition from Taipei to Beijing as the legitimate representative of China in international affairs 25. For the major Latin-American countries, China has be- come an important partner in several ar-enhancing multilateral relations. It is obvi- ous that China would like to have more of a voice in that region. Secondly, China wishes to diversify its external relations to improve China's export strength, and to maintain China's economic conditions. Thirdly, as oil and food supplies are al-ways important resources for national se-curity and economic growth, China, with the largest population worldwide, would like to maintain good relations with major oil and food producers. Latin America, which is rich in oil (Venezuela) and food supplies (Argentina and Brazil), deserves China's special interest. Latin America is also a land of raw materials, like copper in Chile, nickel and cobalt in Cuba, and pulp in Brazil. The Taiwan Factor in CHINLAMERICAN Political Rela-tions From time to time, the Taiwan issue stands out as an obstacle to bilateral rela-tions between China and Latin America. This is always regarded as a political di- lemma in China's expanding relationships with Latin America, since the region con-tains 12 of the 25 countries that still maintain official diplomatic relations with Taiwan. 1819 This number is down from 14 in 2004, as Granada and Dominica switched diplomatic recognition to The People's Republic of China. 20 Latin America has been in a complicated relationship with Taiwan for a long time. Latin America is new to China, but China is not new to Latin America 21, despite the fact that the \"two Chinas\" are different in many ways. Taiwan is a so-called consis-CHINLAMERICA: Challenges and Opportunities for the Future of Sino-Latin-American Relations 58 Journal of Global Development and Peace electrical machinery, and oil in order to meet the demands of China's booming economy. China's imports from Latin America grew from almost $3 billion in 1999 to $120 billion in 2010, a more than 4000% in- crease in eleven years 29 30. Because of this growth in imports, China has run a trade deficit with the region for the past five years. While China's trade flows have in- creased dramatically, both globally and with Latin America, Chinese foreign di-rect investment (FDI) abroad has not been significant. China's cumulative FDI worldwide amounted to $33.2 billion at the end of 2003, just 0.48% of global FDI stock, with 41% concentrated in Hong Kong, the United States, Japan, and Ger-many. Turning to yearly investment flows, China's foreign investment flows for 2003 amounted to $2.85 billion, and more than one-third of that was going to Latin America 31. Chinese investment in Latin America has focused on the extraction and production of national resources, but has also included investment in manufac-turing, assembly, telecommunications, and textiles. China's FDI in the region has been concentrated in Brazil, Mexico, eas, including closer trade and investment as well as collaboration in devising new trade strategies; Latin-American countries are turning their diplomatic policies to- wards a new direction. CHINLAMERICAN Economic Status It is obvious that the bonding of China and Latin America's economies are driv- ing into high-speed lanes, however, chal- lenges and threats are also predictable. According to the World Bank's chief economist for Latin America, Augusto de la Torre, the long-term challenge for Latin America is to \"manage well\" the commodity bonanza that is fueled by Chi-nese demand and to channel earnings into improvements in human capital, infra- structure, and innovation 26. In addition to trade, the doubling of Chinese invest-ments in the region between 2008 and 2009 (from $3.7 billion in 2008 to $7.3 billion in 2009) suggests that China's role in the region is continuing to accelerate at a rapid pace. Statistics from China's Min- istry of Trade indicate that, after Asia, the region is the second largest destination for Chinese investments 2728. How best to profit in terms of development consti-tutes the principal challenge for the coun-tries of Latin America and the Caribbean. CHINLAMERICAN Economic Link- ages Much of China's interest in Latin America is economically motivated, with Beijing eager for access to such commodities as iron and other ore, soybeans, copper, iron and steel, integrated circuits and other CHINLAMERICA: Challenges and Opportunities for the Future of Sino-Latin-American Relations 59 Journal of Global Development and Peace including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, and Venezuela, have conferred on China the status of a market economy, decreas- ing the potential impact that anti- dumping measures may have on cheap Chinese imports 33. China has also desig- nated many nations throughout Latin America and the Caribbean as official tourism destinations for Chinese citizens, allowing Chinese citizens to visit for the first time. CHINLAMERICAN Economic Status at the Current Stage A publication from the Inter-American Development Bank reminds us that \"China's size, rapid growth, external openness, and trade performance are be- ing felt everywhere in Latin-America but perceived differently.\" 34 China will experi- ence significant sustainable economic growth and Latin America should be able to provide the commodities needed for that development. According to The Economist , predictions estimated China with an average of 8.2% increase in its annual Gross Domestic Product in 2011, while the United States is estimated to have only a 2.9% increase. Latin America is a great exporter of commodities to China, but it is also a provider of com-modities to other regions of the world. If China continues to experience economic growth, while the rest of the word contin- ues to experience economic stagnation, the supply and demand of Latin-American commodities will shift towards the development of Chinese industries. III. Trends of Chinese-Latin Ameri- can Economic Development Chile, Argentina, Peru, and Venezuela.32 Since the entry into force of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994, China has viewed Mexico as an access point to the U.S. market. Among the investment pledges high- lighted by the press during President Hu's 2004 trip to Latin America were railways, oil exploration, and construction projects in Argentina, a nickel plant in Cuba, cop- per mining projects in Chile, and a steel mill, railway, and oil exploration projects in Brazil. In January 2005, Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez traveled to China to sign nineteen cooperation agreements, including plans for Chinese investment in oil and gas exploration. Colombia's Presi- dent \u00c1lvaro Uribe traveled to China in mid-April 2005 promoting increased in- vestment in his country. In addition to China's plans for increased investment, China and Chile announced in 2004 that they would be negotiating a bilateral free trade agreement. In response to China's requests, many Latin-American nations, CHINLAMERICA: Challenges and Opportunities for the Future of Sino-Latin-American Relations 60 Journal of Global Development and Peace But building a CHINLAMERICAN stra- tegic relationship is challenging, not only because of the low levels of Chinese in- vestments in Latin America, but also be- cause the investments that do occur gen-erally employ Chinese laborers and mate-rials brought over for specific infrastruc-ture projects. While there are negative characteristics to China's economic model, such as less attention on environmentally sound practices, making it an easier com- mercial partner as compared to the United States and Europe, the CHINLAMERICAN relationship re-quires deeper cultural understanding. Within this context, the economic rela-tionship between China and Latin Amer-ica will go further with improved coop-eration. Can China and Latin America Bond Culturally? The cultural exchange between China and Latin America can be traced back to a long history. The first group of Chinese people reached Latin America in 1849 through the Port of Callao in Peru. 36 The cultural exchange between China and Latin America can be traced back to a long history. The first group of Chinese people reached Latin America in 1849 through the Port of Callao in Peru 37. An agreement of commerce was established between China and Peru in 1874, which was the first legal statement of coopera- tion between China and Latin America38. Since then, Chinese people have spread over the whole of Latin America, and Chinese culture and Latin American cul-ture were integrated. The trading quality between China and Latin America is improving and Latin America's trade partnership with China is increasingly important. However, it is not enough. Despite the benefits of high ex-port prices, the concentration of exports to China in specific areas, such as soy, raw materials, and minerals makes Latin America vulnerable to an economic downturn and reinforces its traditional production structures. A more compli- cated economic cooperation system should be established in order to achieve sustainable growth. The CHINLAMERI-CAN trade model must move beyond free trade agreements and mutual trading benefits. Investments, however, should be in a positive direction. Statistics dem-onstrate that Chinese FDI in Latin Amer- ica is now low, and 80 percent of FDI is directed toward tax havens. It is a weak-ness in CHINLAMERICAN economic development now. However, that means there is room for development as well. From a strategic perspective, China's in-terests in Latin America are becoming more and more sophisticated, and eco- nomic pursuits are tied to political wishes. This is distinct from Russia's ideologically based military and diplomatic alliance with the government of Venezuela, de-scribed by Cunningham as aimed at bal-ancing U.S. influence in the region 35. Latin-American countries may have ini- tially pursued the Chinese market to serve as a \"strategic counterweight\" to the re-gion's historical commercial and political dependence on the United States. Yet the relationship has not necessarily fulfilled these expectations. CHINLAMERICA: Challenges and Opportunities for the Future of Sino-Latin-American Relations 61 Journal of Global Development and Peace The cultural relations between China and Latin America are no doubt one of the most impressive accomplishments in China's cultural outreach. China and Latin America are achieving mutual bene-fits through such collaboration. While the United States remains a dominant cultural reference, the increasing mass of Chinese culture is expanding in Latin America and achieving growing importance as well as meeting expectations. Recommendations and Conclusions The initiatives between China and Latin America are active and will continue. There is no doubt that China is trying to claim more of a voice in Latin America. The political interaction between China and Latin America will not only benefit China by gaining more support from de-veloping nations, but it will also strengthen China's leadership in South - South cooperation. China's political ap- proach in Latin America is friendly; how-ever, it is also strategic in its search for deeper cooperation. Latin America is re- garded as a major supplier for China's energy and raw material consumption. To keep a good relationship with Latin America is also beneficial in maintaining China's economic security. In the academic world, hundreds of Chi- nese students are sent to Cuba, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina to study every year. 39 At the same time, learning Chinese has become popular for Latin-American people. Chinese language programs and China studies programs in Latin-American universities have proliferated since 2004. 40 Confucius Institutes, which are mainly for the spread and promotion of Chinese culture, are widely established in Latin America. They are now very effi- cient and work as communication bridges in CHINLAMERICAN relations. The intellectual and cultural exchange be-tween China and Latin America has been beneficial to both. Some earth resource satellites are co-produced and launched by China and Brazil. Agreements, state- ments and lawful documents signed by China and Brazil cover certain areas in the science and technology fields, includ- ing aeronautics, information technology, hydropower, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, chemistry, medical sciences, environmental protection, resources and new materials . There is also cooperation in the field of producing and launching satellites, and Chinese-made satellites for Venezuela have been successfully launched, leading many other Latin American countries to now be in commu-nication with China for their satellite in- dustry. In regards to other high-tech ex- ploits, Chinese companies have been un- dertaking the modernization of Cuba Telecom. An Internet upgrade project in Venezuela is supposed to be completed by Chinese companies as well.

Abstract This article discusses the individual and collective issues that the West African Eco- nomic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) faces on its path towards regional political and economic integration. The economic development of WAEMU must occur alongside political developments such as improving the rule of law and emphasizing democratic principles within each country. These principles include solidifying good governance, the adherence to legal principles, vertical accountability, improved freedom of expres-sion and an enhanced grassroots-level civil society within each member country. Fur-thermore, Senegal and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire have the potential to enhance their economic inte-gration by following a common market strategy, similar to that of the European Union. With that, this article argues that Senegal can be a model for the rest of WAEMU, given its history of democratic principles and freedom of expression. There is the potential to improve the rule of law in Senegal through various existing organizations working in the realm of Information Communication Technology initiatives (ICT). It is the hope that with Senegal leading by example in enhancing the rule of law and improving its eco-nomic relations with C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, that the future integration and growth of WAEMU may occur. 70 Journal of Global Development and Peace Franc-CFA zone. Inspired by the Euro- pean Union, the WAEMU aims to har-monize legislation and integration of in- ternal markets and interests. 1 Building off of a system set up by colonized interests, the WAEMU is a modern and independ-ent concept whose establishment dis-played a shift in respect for individual sovereignty in order \"to complete\" the monetary union. 2 The WAEMU stands on the principles of greater economic competitiveness through open markets as well as the rationalization and harmoniza-tion of the legal environment. It also abides to a convergence of macro-economic policies and indicators, the creation of a common market, a coordi-nation of sector policies, and the organi-zation of fiscal policies. The existing framework attempts to cooperate in pol- icy areas which have been autonomously controlled, such as trade patterns and monetary policies. The WAEMU is com- prised of the following countries along- side Senegal: Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, and Togo. The WAEMU customs and currency unit formed to further economic integration and it has future plans of trade liberaliza-tion and macroeconomic policy integra-tion with the Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS). The 2000 ECOWAS Annual Report noted plans towards the harmonization of a common market, convergence of macroeconomic policies alongside the development of fi-nancing and private sector encourage-ment, and the synchronization of sectoral policies. 3 ECOWAS has agreed to adopt WAEMU's customs declaration form and Introduction of Initiatives in Senegal and the West African Economic and Monetary Union In West Africa, greater economic and po-litical unity is essential for future growth. The foundation of the West African Eco-nomic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), established in 1994, shows promise for such harmony, but policies within the member-states must first be solidified. Fundamental progress may be achieved by improving the rule of law, a key to in-tegration, within the model member country of Senegal. By promoting the de-mocratic principles of civil society, good governance, adherence to legal principles, and vertical accountability in Senegal, with the help of the United Nations De- velopment Programme's (UNDP) Oslo Governance Center, the Panos Institute of West Africa (PIWA), and by using In-formation Technology Initiatives (ICT), it would enhance the stability of the WAEMU union towards a stable path in the future. As history has shown with the success of the regional integration of the European Union (EU), the WAEMU has the potential to model itself after certain aspects of the EU to promote future re-gional political and economic integration. With the improvement of the rule of law as the foundation, economic and political integration can persevere through the powerful relationship between C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Senegal. The history of the French-colonized re-gion of West Africa has been one strongly influenced by wealthy European nations. The WAEMU was founded as a means to further integrate the shared currency Rule of Law in Senegal and the West African Economic and Monetary Union: Information Technology Initiatives 71 Journal of Global Development and Peace Regional Integration and the European UnionA system rooted in the rule of law is crucial for regional political and eco- nomic integration, as evident in the EU. Binding agreements allow the practice of economic and political integration to be-come enforceable, amendable, and fitting to the times. Member countries must abide by the rules and rights laid out in treaties. Both the EU's institutions and the EU governments must adhere to such provisions whenever it is applicable and as in accordance to EU law. 5 At this point, the EU is committed to improving the transparency and democracy of member states and is also in pursuit of other goals such as promoting human rights, freedom, democracy, equality and human dignity worldwide. 6 The single market is one of the main ob-jectives of the EU, so that each member country can benefit and trade resources and services with other members. With efficiency and connectivity at an all-time high, this makes the economic exchange easier. By sharing political institutions and laws, economic benefit can be greater and integration further improved. 7 The WAEMU must follow in the footsteps of the most politically and economically in-tegrated institutions in the world, as such has been a functioning and successful mechanism to increase regional integra- tion. Functionalist Framework - the EU and WAEMU The EU or, as its predecessor was known in 1950, the European Coal and Steel Community, was founded on principles compensation mechanisms, which are small steps towards political and eco-nomic integration. Regional Integration and the Euro-pean Union Regional political and economic integra-tion has several advantages. Not only does consensual collaboration prove beneficial when it comes to negotiating with outside actors, but a successful cus- toms union allows for traits such as com-parative advantage and less competition to improve the economic standing of the members. Furthermore, the shared his-tory of colonialism and common currency has made the political and economic inte-gration of the WAEMU opportune. It is the hope that as the rule of law improves and democracy becomes less top-heavy in the WAEMU countries, a well-balanced union can prevail. Another regionally integrated actor, the EU, has inspired political and economic integration in many parts of the world and is a good model for the WAEMU. Founded on principles of economic co-operation, the EU has developed into a single market entity and integrated social policy body united under one common currency. While the EU has transformed over the centuries the EU is much less than a century old - this should be re- phrased based on the intent of the author, which is not entirely clear to me and was originally founded to partially avoid strife, it has valuable attributes which can be beneficial for WAEMU members. 4 Rule of Law in Senegal and the West African Economic and Monetary Union: Information Technology Initiatives 72 Journal of Global Development and Peace quires a system of political norms, or a base in the rule of law, in order to en-hance its economic integration. That be- ing said, the WAEMU can develop both aspects synonymously through the special relationship of Ivory Coast and Senegal. As evident in the founding of the EU, France and Germany played an instru-mental role in establishing the relation-ship by trading coal and steel. 10 The dy- namic forces eventually influenced other European actors to become involved and branch into their own comparative advan-tages. The role that France and Germany played in the foundation of the EU can translate to the relationship between Ivory Coast and Senegal in the WAEMU. These two countries can positively influ- ence the future of the union as the eco- nomic forces develop alongside the en-hancement of the rule of law. Economies of WAEMU The economies of WAEMU countries are mixed and have the potential to comple- ment one another in the future. The more advanced countries of Senegal and Ivory Coast have primarily manufacturing and industry economies, while the less ad-vanced countries of Guinea-Bissau, Togo and Niger have mostly agriculture-based economies. The import and export goods are varied as well. Senegal exports fish products, phosphates, and peanuts while it imports food, consumer goods, petro-leum and machinery. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire ex-ports petroleum, cocoa, coffee and timber while it imports fuel, consumer goods, rice and wheat. Guinea-Bissau exports cashews, fish, shrimp and peanuts while it of economic integration with political goals in mind. From the creation of the EU, it was understood that in order for political integration to occur, it must be based on economic collaboration. Through the formation of a \"common market,\" EU countries removed barriers and streamlined policies as economic transactions occurred. As in the EU, the functionalist approach implies that for the WAEMU political integration may de- velop from the basis in the \"common market\" and unified interactions. 8 Al- though a key to EU integration, the func-tionalist approach does not show much promise towards the future economic and political integration of the WAEMU. While the more powerful economic play-ers of Ivory Coast and Senegal can lead the economic integration, the WAEMU has developed in a different manner than that of the EU. The arrangement of the Franc-CFA zone of the WAEMU, which is between France and fifteen African countries, has been a key element in sustaining the rela- tionship between countries. The zone has provided sufficient protection from monetary crises in the past, as it was pegged to the French Franc until 1994, a brief explanation of what happened since the EURO was introduced would be ap-propriate here and has arguably tied the region to its former colonial power ever since. As such, the CFA-Franc is man- aged by the French Treasury, which guar-antees its full convertibility. It is these be-ginnings as a monetary union, rather than an economically integrated zone as in the case of the EU, which sets the WAEMU apart. 9 At this point, the WAEMU re-Rule of Law in Senegal and the West African Economic and Monetary Union: Information Technology Initiatives 73 Journal of Global Development and Peace While there is a wide spectrum of import and export relations and varying GDPs, there is potential for future collaboration amongst WAEMU countries, as some countries currently import what another country exports and vice-versa. 16 For ex- ample, Senegal imports petroleum while C\u00f4te d'Ivoire exports petroleum. The re-lationship between these two countries has the potential to be the economic driv-ers of the WAEMU through trade, which could have a positive influence over the future political and economic integration of the union. If the Ivory Coast and Sene-gal follow a similar path to that of France and Germany, which was rooted in trade policy, the future looks promising. Also, in the future, there is potential for trade integration with ECOWAS nations, such as Nigeria and Ghana. Roadblocks of the WAEMU Countries Despite functioning economies, sover- eignty values and a strong connection be-tween the WAEMU states and France, there are economic, political and social disparities within the member countries. The WAEMU lacks cohesion, financing and unifying policies, and it experiences the hesitance to reduce individual sover-eignty. The West African region struggles with issues of rampant corruption, ongo-ing decentralization, frequent judicial vio- lations, and sparse human rights protec- tions. 17 Corruption can further inhibit ef- fective governance and can negatively af-fect rule of law enforcing mechanisms. Out of 178 countries, Senegal ranked 105, Ivory Coast ranked 146, and Guinea-Bissau ranked 154 in Transparency Inter- national's 2010 Corruption Perception imports food and petroleum products. Togo exports phosphates, cocoa, and cof-fee while it imports consumer goods. Ni- ger exports uranium, livestock and gold while it imports consumer goods, petro-leum and foodstuffs. 11 The world's import and export relations with WAEMU countries are varied. Most of the nations which trade with the WAEMU are developed and influential in world affairs. Senegal exports to Mali, France, and India and imports from France, the United Kingdom, Nigeria and China. Ivory Coast exports to the United States, the Netherlands, Nigeria, France and Burkina Faso while it imports from Nigeria, France, China and Thailand. Guinea-Bissau exports to India and Nige- ria while it imports from Senegal, Portu- gal, Brazil and Cuba. Togo exports to In-dia, Germany, Benin, Ghana, and Burkina Faso while it imports from China, France and the United States. Niger exports to Nigeria, the United States, and Ghana while it imports from China, France, French Polynesia, Nigeria and Ivory Coast. 12 Senegal holds a respectable profile in the WAEMU with the second highest Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which was $25.4 billion in 2011. 13 In 2011, Ivory Coast had a GDP of $35.6 billion, Niger had a GDP of $11.93 billion and Togo had a GDP of $6.324 billion.14 Over half of West Africa's petroleum products and oil go through Ivory Coast and it is a ma-jor exporter of petroleum products as well as electricity to Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali and Togo. 15 Rule of Law in Senegal and the West African Economic and Monetary Union: Information Technology Initiatives 74 Journal of Global Development and Peace to make profits and invest in their econo- mies. There is also a limited availability of well-trained labor in WAEMU nations. The lack in trainable individuals can be seen in the education levels of the coun-tries. Senegal and Ivory Coast have the more stable school attendance rates, with 87% and 88% primary school enrollment respectively. 24 Corruption, poverty, the inability to export goods, dependence on international actors and the lack of train- able labor have all contributed to the in- ability of the WAEMU to politically and economically integrate. Steps Forward Begin with Democratic Principles and Senegal Strong democratic institutions are neces- sary for the successful integration of the WAEMU, for it is the basis for further cohesion and cooperation. As evident in the European Union (EU), the rule of law is the foundation for the development of an economic and political union. Within the EU, decisions are based on treaties that are voluntarily and democratically agreed to by all member countries. As one of the EU's core values, rule of law must endure in the WAEMU countries. The respect for human rights, democracy and equality must be systematically inher-ent for future agreements and integration. It is for these reasons that the WAEMU must respectfully enable itself in a similar capacity to that of the EU through trans- parent and democratic institutions along-side a reliable rule of law. 25 However, unstable democracies exist within the WAEMU and include Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Guinea-Bissau, Mali Index.18 Furthermore, the WAEMU member states are all deeply impover-ished and indebted Least-Developed Countries (LDCs). Nearly 54% of the population of Senegal lives below the poverty line. 19 Togo ranked 186 out of 187 countries in the UNDP's Human De-velopment Index and has 43% of the population living below the international poverty line of $1.25 per day. 20 In common with many LDC countries, the primarily agriculture-based economies are unable to properly extract and control the resources found within their borders. In the WAEMU member state of Guinea-Bissau, for example, the economy is based on farming and fishing. Rice and mangos are widely produced crops and if their respective industries were properly developed, the country could be self-sufficient in rice production and export mangoes worldwide. In addition, in Guinea-Bissau the industrial development of petroleum and phosphates are not pur-sued due to the high price of the initial start-up. Unexploited off-shore oil re- serves also deem cause for future eco- nomic development in the region. 21 The WAEMU economies are heavily de-pendent on international funding from other countries including the United States, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. For example, the United States provided $98.7 million in assistance to Senegal in 2011. 22 The Euro- pean Commission has provided 297.8 million Euros to Senegal for the years of 2008-2013. 23 With such external depend- ence comes astronomical debt, which makes it difficult for WAEMU countries Rule of Law in Senegal and the West African Economic and Monetary Union: Information Technology Initiatives 75 Journal of Global Development and Peace Free,\" in between \"Free\" and \"Not Free.\" In addition, on a scale of one to seven, with one representing the most free and seven representing the least free, Senegal was given a three in terms of po-litical rights, civil liberties and a freedom rating. 28 Workers' rights to organize, strike, and bargain collectively are protected except for employees that work in the security industry. This right was evident in August 2010 when the national telecommunica-tions company, SONATEL, severely damaged all country-wide communica-tions as a result of its one day strike. The unionized workers were protesting a gov-ernment contract with a U.S. telecommu-nications company but after the strike, the contract was cancelled, further show- ing the intact rule of law in Senegal. 29 Above all, respect for fundamental rights, open political discourse and freedom of expression, association and religion are strong and guaranteed in the country. The educational environment in Senegal is steadily improving, as attendance levels are strong enough to inform the citizens and improve country-wide democratic institutions. As mentioned above, primary school enrollment in the country is 87%, secondary school enrollment is 37% and tertiary school enrollment is 8%. Mean- while, 50% of adults and 65% percent of youth are literate. 30 Educational improve- ments have been enforced as Senegal is pursuing the Millennium Development Goals, which stress the achievement of universal primary school education for all by 2015. With international backing and a national agenda to improve education, and Togo. These countries have been plagued with civil strife, face restrictive political freedoms, endure limited human rights protections, have experienced reoc- curring coups, and experience rampant nepotism. The stable countries of Benin, Niger and Senegal can lead the way for other WAEMU countries if these democ-racies continue to advance. The path to-wards cohesion begins by strengthening and enforcing the rule of law in Senegal, a country that is on the path towards solidi- fying its own governance, which will eventually promote unity amongst all WAEMU countries. Individual country stability is an impera-tive component of WAEMU political and economic integration. Besides having one of the highest GDPs, Senegal also has a one of the highest rankings in the region in its functioning of government, political participation, political culture, civil liber- ties, democracy index, and electoral proc- esses and pluralism. 26 It is one of the few countries in Africa that has not had a coup since independence. The capital city of Dakar is a hub in West Africa, with its high profile in world affairs, shipping, transport, and as a home to many banks including the BCAO bank, which con-trols the CFA-franc monetary policy. There is also a free and diversified media in which Senegal is home to dozens of independent newspapers. There are nu- merous NGOs which operate freely in the country or host West African regional offices in Dakar. 27 In addition, according to the democracy watchdog Freedom House , which conducts extensive analysis and evaluation through a team of scholars and experts, Senegal is considered \"Partly Rule of Law in Senegal and the West African Economic and Monetary Union: Information Technology Initiatives 76 Journal of Global Development and Peace Recent events in Senegal have proven its stability, adherence to the constitution, and the endurance of the voice of people. Former President Abdoulaye Wade ran for a third term on February 26, 2012, despite strict rules against the practice in the constitution. In the first round of elections, international observers and small-scale protesters in fierce opposition urged Wade to refrain from running. Af-ter no candidate received the necessary percentage of votes to win the election, a run-off was announced between Wade and the runner-up, Macky Sall. After the second round of voting on March 25, 2012, Wade conceded the election to Sall after realizing the people had spoken. The young population and distinctive youth culture of Senegal mobilized against the authoritarian Wade who refused to let up his power. As exposed during the election season, Sall openly criticized Wade's nepotism and grand expenditures. 32 The free elections and democratic character of the military not only prevented a coup during the elections; they have done so since Senegal's independence. Not only has the political discourse, transparency and accountability in Sene-gal been a good model for the WAEMU, but President Macky Sall has claimed he will institute a subdued, more financially-controlled administration intent on \"a new republic, in which the equilibrium between institutions is respected.\" 33 With a new President, Senegal is not only on the path towards improving its democ-ratic stability and balancing governing bodies, but the country is on the path to equip people with the tools to sustain themselves. As observed by Freedom House , Senegal has set a good example for the improvement of a crucial component of political and economic integration. The stability of Senegal can become a model for progression of the WAEMU region. The Political Climate of Senegal The political development of democratic Senegal officially began upon independ-ence from France in 1960. In Senegal's secular pluralistic society, the president, the parliament, the government, the social and economic council, the supreme court, the court of auditors and the lower courts constitute the government. The president is elected by popular vote and may serve two terms of five [since 2001 according to Wikipedia] years each. The constitution allows political parties to disagree with government policy and grants them the right to openly oppose it. Human rights are protected in Senegal's constitution through its announced commitment to fundamental rights, as defined in the Dec-laration of Human and Citizen Rights of 1789 and in the 1948 Universal Declara- tion of Human Rights. Locally, human rights institutions include the Ligue S\u00e9-n\u00e9galaise des Droits de L'homme (Senegalese League of Human Rights), Amnesty International, the Institut Afri-cain pour les Droits de L'homme (African Institute for Human Rights) and the Insti- tut des Droits de L'homme et de la Paix (Institute of Human Rights and Peace), all of which protect the rights of the Sene-galese. 31 For these reasons, a stable framework is in place to improve the rule of law, enhance democracy, and build vertical accountability through civil soci- ety support. Rule of Law in Senegal and the West African Economic and Monetary Union: Information Technology Initiatives 77 Journal of Global Development and Peace some critics say is nonexistent in Senegal, despite the recent change in president.37 Abdoulaye Wade, who was president for twelve years and maintained a heavy in- fluence in the political opposition for about thirty years before he took office, is still ever present in society despite the new government of President Sall. There is a deep connection between marabous, or holy leaders, and government leaders, which Wade created when he was the head of state. Wade allegedly handed off resources such as cars to marabous, cre-ated government agencies with no pur-pose and placed those connected to him in high government offices. 38 The resources Wade took advantage of while he was in office demonstrate the need to improve vertical accountability in Senegal, or the means through which citi-zens, mass media and civil society attempt to hold leaders responsible to adhere to good governance principles. 39 While hori- zontal accountability is technically in place, through a system of checks and balances between the judicial, executive, and legislative branches of the govern- ment, leaders must be held responsible for their actions to the public and ensure that they are responsible to the popula-tion they are meant to serve. 40 Regardless, the limited vertical accountability has the potential to increase under the new gov- ernment, as it is necessary to strengthen the rule of law within the country and is needed for the country to lead the path towards further regional political and eco-nomic integration of the WAEMU. \"the reportedly free and fair elections should serve as an important example to neighboring countries in a region where electoral turnovers are often fraught with violence.\" 34 President Sall promises to take Senegal in a new direction, which is a good example for the future political and economic WAEMU integration. Through effective civil society openness, leader-initiated as well as grassroots change, and citizen participation, it will enhance the rule of law as a model for other WAEMU countries. Despite the successful recent events in Senegal, which have proved its longstand-ing democracy is still strong, there is a disparity of representation of men and women in the government and a tremen- dous shortfall of sufficient vertical ac- countability. Although in May 2010 the National Assembly passed legislation re-quiring candidate lists to show the parity between men and women, which led Wade to allot for 30 percent of the nine new cabinet posts to be given to women, some thought the action was to improve the power of his own party. 35 While Wade was in office, many accused the former President of providing preferential treat-ment to his associates in business, specifi-cally the allocation of frequencies and broadcasting fees associated with radio stations. 36 Such recent actions in Senegal still threaten the future democracy. There are reports that the legacy of the Wade government continues in the coun-try. This demonstrates the need for more vertical accountability, which is necessary for a strong democracy, and the need to improve horizontal accountability, which Rule of Law in Senegal and the West African Economic and Monetary Union: Information Technology Initiatives 78 Journal of Global Development and Peace cratic nature of governments, can help businesses establish more easily and al-lows individuals to become active partici- pants from their regions. Senegal will enhance the rule of law within its borders with the help of the es-tablished motivators and ground-level ini-tiators. The UNDP's Oslo Governance Center office in Dakar encourages net-working and teamwork as pillars in estab- lishing democratic governance while working in collaboration with leading in-stitutions, including the Panos Institute of West Africa (PIWA). By spreading infor-mation and expressing the voiced con-cerns of citizens, the ICT program under the UNDP's Oslo Governance Center, in conjunction with PIWA, plans to build well-grounded relationships between the media and civil society organizations in the coming years. 44 Since the 1990s, UNDP has been promoting the use of ICT as a catalyst for development in Senegal; since 2001, UNDP has increased its focus on promoting e-governance and access to information for the general populace so that they may be involved in the democratic processes. Additionally, the National Good Govern-ance Program (PNGB) in Senegal, over-seen by UNDP and the World Bank, is also helping to monitor and evaluate the indicators inhibiting and protecting effec- tive and influential governing mecha- nisms. 45 PNGB's approach is enabling and solidifying democratic governance with special attention paid to marginal-ized groups often denied access to the political decision-making processes. This approach allows for more accountability Non-Governmental Initiatives and ICT It is the belief that by reaching effective rule of law with full citizen participation and vertical accountability, WAEMU eco-nomic policy and political cooperation can drastically improve. Senegal will serve as an example given its well-rounded so-cial, political, and economic stability. Such improvement in the rule of law within Senegal can be done through ICT, which would increase political participation and awareness through cell phones, com-puters, and other modern technologies. Currently, 50% of the population uses cell phones and there are almost 2 million Internet users. 41 By promoting transpar- ency of the political processes and im- proving the quality of information trans- ferred to the public, it can help strengthen the rule of law. Citizen participation needs to be enhanced so that individuals can actively partake and become in- formed members in their civil society. 42 ICT initiatives will then in turn improve the rule of law in Senegal and the rest of the WAEMU countries. E-governance, or governing through elec-tronic means, can strengthen democratic governing processes. In addition, e-participation, or the use of ICT to politi-cally participate, allows citizens to voice their concerns, hold elected officials re- sponsible and promote lasting develop- ment and change in their remote commu-nities. Through increased access to infor-mation, representation, consultation, vol-unteering, and monitoring, citizens have the ability to participate in their govern- ments. 43 ICT also organizes the bureau-Rule of Law in Senegal and the West African Economic and Monetary Union: Information Technology Initiatives 79 Journal of Global Development and Peace website, Forum Civil provides materials for Senegalese citizens to enable compre-hensive citizen monitoring. 47 U n d e r t h e assistance of NGOs such as PNGB, Vi- sion e-Senegal is the national ICT plan that works to include citizens and busi-nesses as a top priority for the govern-ment, to enable citizen response to gov-ernment leaders and improve overall ac-cess to information. While the existing programs in the realm of good governance and promotion of civil society through ICT mechanisms is promising, there have been noticeable problems. Proper infrastructure, specifi-cally electricity, computer machinery and routine maintenance have been lacking. Also, many people did not know about the existence of forums such as the ADIE program. The slow launch of ICT has also been attributed to low levels of French literacy, as the most widely- spoken language, Wolof, is not a written language. Despite uncertainties, the promise of ICT is vast and solutions are attainable with the right institutional guidance and inter-national assistance. Given the recent in-crease in school attendance and comple-tion rates in Senegal, the educational im-provements will help improve citizen par-ticipation as individuals become informed. Educational pushes and ad campaigns through the Internet, newspapers and television can increase awareness and in-form citizens of the ongoing programs aimed at developing their country. In ad-dition, the encouragement of audio-equipped devices will hopefully enable people to actively engage even if their na-within democratic institutions, and pro- motes democratic governance princi-ples. 46 The WAEMU is also promoting the implementation of a legal framework to validate electronic documents and pro-tect personal data. Senegalese ICT Progress The government of Senegal has been ac-tive in its promotion of ICT within the last few decades, which is a good indica- tor for the longevity of improved citizen participation and increased civil society involvement. The government's pursuit alongside non-governmental organiza-tions and international donors has equipped the system to handle future changes to ultimately reach a model level of transparency and awareness that WAEMU countries may strive to achieve. Some initiatives in Senegal include the Agence de l'Informatique de l'Etate (ADIE), which was established in 2006 by a governmental agency to encourage the modernization of government services through the adoption of ICT. As an in- formation hub, ADIE informs users of their rights and provides various forms and tools to ensure citizen protections within the system. Another program is the Net Interactif Multim\u00e9 dia, which works to decentralize, improve awareness of local issues and promote development through ICT. In addition, Forum Civil is a grassroots organization which works to promote global and participatory democ-racy, establish responsible citizenry, pro-mote transparency, good governance and anti-corruption markers, and encourage national objective expertise. Through its Rule of Law in Senegal and the West African Economic and Monetary Union: Information Technology Initiatives 80 Journal of Global Development and Peace same way that Germany and France influ- enced members of the EU to take a simi-lar path, the dominant countries of Ivory Coast and Senegal can improve the future of the union. The EU and the WAEMU have many common attributes which, if put into practice, can benefit the WAEMU in the future. Furthermore, the \"common market\" and unified actions through trade can improve the develop-ment of the WAEMU only if they follow a path of enhancing the rule of law. Fur- thermore, as ICT initiatives improve ver-tical accountability, economic relations may be enhanced. It is in Senegal's best interest for democ-ratic progress and rule of law enforce-ment to continue. ICT will provide valu- able information to many including mar- ginalized rural farmers and urban college students. It will educate the public about political events, streamline bureaucratic and administrative processes, assist Sene- gal in reaching its Millennium Develop-ment Goals and promote overall govern-mental transparency and accountability in the open. Given the democratic situation in Senegal, it is ripe for ICT investment and coordination through enhancing ex-isting institutions. Political and economic integration re-quires governmental cooperation, public involvement and grassroots support. The opportunity to strengthen the rule of law in Senegal must be utilized in the midst of the rapid rise of technology and ICT pro-gress in the region. The composition and relationships between the WAEMU countries is rapidly changing but depends on the strength of each individual country, tive tongue is not a written language. The existing Senegalese framework and initia-tives will enable the UNDP and PIWA to continue to work in good governance and grow civil society throughout the country. Conclusion The media and ICT play a crucial role in changing the way the government func-tions in Senegal and in the region. In the evolving environment, the Senegalese government must promote and support ICT progress and vertical accountability. Although the movement is in the earliest stages, institutional support is imperative. The connection between governmental offices and the general populace must be bridged for the enhancement of the rule of law in Senegal and the future regional political and economic integration of the WAEMU. Through the use of ICT pro-grams such as ADIE, Net Interactif Mul- tim\u00e9dia, Forum Civil, and Vision e- Senegal under the support of the UNDP, PIWA and PNGB, the progress of the rule of law may continue to further eco- nomically and politically integrate Senegal and eventually the WAEMU. Senegal has the potential to be a leader through its democratic principles which can improve relations and solidify policies of the WAEMU. Through an emphasis on vertical accountability via civil society and ICT initiatives, the future of the WAEMU looks bright. The democratic advances and improved trade relations between Ivory Coast and Senegal can also help lead other WAEMU members in a similar direction. By modeling rele- vant traits of the EU, specifically in the Rule of Law in Senegal and the West African Economic and Monetary Union: Information Technology Initiatives 81 Journal of Global Development and Peace and the power of the people within each country. The political validity and rule of law can swiftly improve if the technolo- gies are properly used to benefit the peo- ple. From there, future integration within the WAEMU may occur.

Rule of Law in Senegal and the West African Economic and Monetary Union: Information Technology Initiatives Enhancing Regional Integration to Advance Stability in the Democratic Republic of Congo Stella Kim 87 Abstract Political and economic integration's main objective is to establish peace and stability in a region through trade and cooperation. The Democratic Republic of Congo currently lacks both peace and stability, and has a long way to go before achieving these objectives. In efforts to gain stability through economic growth, the DRC is a part of four Regional Economic Communities (RECs) in Africa, which are all at different levels of integration and implementation. The four regional blocs are the SADC, COMESA, ECCAS, and CEPGL. However, due to the challenges of overlapping memberships in these RECs, it is recommended that the DRC concentrate on furthering integration with SADC and COMESA, while applying for membership in the EAC in hopes that the three RECs merge in the near future. Through good governance, support of the rule of law, and curtailing corruption, the DRC can continue strengthening its regional cooperation. Furthermore, it must focus on reforming the mining sector, which offers the best pros- pects for economic growth, while diversifying through further development of the Inga Power Complex project. Biography Stella Kim is currently a graduate student in the Global Development and Peace program at the University of Bridgeport, with a focus on Political Economy and Development. She also has a B.A. in Psychology from the University of Chicago. Journal of Global Development and Peace Enhancing Regional Integration to Advance Stability in the Democratic Republic of Congo 88 Journal of Global Development and Peace are offered on how to enhance regional integration with a spotlight on the mining sector. Africa and Political and Economic In-tegration Regional trade agreements are prolific on the continent of Africa. David Lynch, a professor of political science, states in Trade and Globalization: An Introduction to Regional Trade Agreements , \"There are over 30 RTAs (Regional Trade Agreements) in Africa, and African countries average four memberships each.\" 1 The numerous RTAs came into being as African coun-tries claimed independence from their colonizers. African nations have inherited countless difficulties, both as colonies and as post-colonial states. Aside from the damage to society and culture, whole economies were left in tatters as coloniz-ers pulled out and left little behind for national reconstruction. An example of this is found in the trans-port infrastructure of many African na- tions. These transport systems were origi- nally built to move natural resources from their sources to markets in Europe and other developed countries. After inde-pendence, many of these transport sys-tems were not maintained and now the lack of transport infrastructure in some African nations is proving to be an enor- mous detriment to development. Furthermore, colonialism shaped African economies towards serving the purposes of hegemonic powers rather than the lo-cal population. Lynch puts it succinctly by stating, \"Moreover, colonial rule halted Introduction The Democratic Republic of Congo is a country full of contradictions. On the one hand, the DRC has been endowed with an abundance of natural resources that represent immense potential for eco-nomic growth and wealth. However, the DRC continues to maintain its status as a country in humanitarian crisis. This crisis persists at a level that has the nation chronically teetering on the edge of be- coming a failed state. Violence, corrup-tion, a weak government, and warring mi-litia groups plague the DRC, yet the country is striving to move towards sta-bility. There has been recent economic growth that indicates that progress in the right direction can still be realized. Progress for the Democratic Republic of Congo is possible due to its strategic geo-physical location on the continent of Af- rica. Its borders touch every region of Africa, providing opportunities for inte-gration in the form of Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs). This article explores why RTAs are so prevalent in Africa, and addresses the notion of a resource trap. As a way to combat the negative effects of the resource trap, South-South Coop-eration is referenced. Later, some back-ground information on the Democratic Republic of Congo will be provided, as well as the regional integration arrange- ments of the DRC. The DRC is currently a member of four different regional eco-nomic communities. Each REC will be covered, as well as the negative aspects of overlapping membership, finishing with a suggestion on how the DRC can correct this. In the conclusion, recommendations Enhancing Regional Integration to Advance Stability in the Democratic Republic of Congo 89 Journal of Global Development and Peace port activities uncompetitive. South-South Cooperation The negative effects of Dutch Disease and of rent seeking further reinforce the need for regional trade agreements in Af-rica. However, more recently, the con-cept of South-South Cooperation has played a significant role in RTAs. South-South Cooperation is defined as a general framework of collaboration between de- veloping countries to share technical ex-pertise, knowledge, and skills to achieve their development goals. The United Na-tions Development Programme's Special Unit on South-South Cooperation states its guiding principle as, \"South -South co- operation is a manifestation of solidarity among peoples and countries of the South that contributes to their national well-being, their national and collective self-reliance and the attainment of inter- nationally agreed development goals, in- cluding the Millennium Development Goals.\" 6 Based on the guiding principles and objectives of South-South Coopera- tion, regional trade arrangements provide the perfect forum to enhance trade among developing countries, while ex-changing knowledge and skills. Background Information on the De-mocratic Republic of Congo The Democratic Republic of Congo is situated in the heart of Sub-Saharan Af-rica, and is bordered by Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, as well as six other nations. 7 It is the twelfth largest country in the world, and has an estimated population of ap- proximately 70 million people. many organic economic arrangements such as local or regional trade and cur-rency patterns, and forced economic rela- tions with the colonial power - by colo- nial power rules.\" 2 Thus, it can be seen that the proliferation in Regional Trade Agreements in Africa was a response by newly independent nations to establish themselves against the hegemony of colo-nial powers, and as part of their own re-covery and growth process. Smaller na- tions also realized that RTAs have a stronger presence in the global market as an amalgamation of economic influence. Natural resources are abundant in Africa, which can either be a windfall or a curse depending on how the resource is man-aged. In The Bottom Billion , Paul Collier refers to resource wealth as \"The Natural Resource Trap.\" 3 Collier explains why resources are a trap that works to per-petuate extreme poverty in the poorest of countries by stating, \"Economists term the excess of revenues over all costs in-cluding normal profit margins 'rent,' and rents seem to be damaging. Over time, countries with large resource discoveries can end up poorer, with the lost growth more than offsetting the one-off gain in income provided by the rents.\" 4 It is the rent seeking culture and dependence on raw materials that creates damaging con-ditions for trade in a country. This can further be explained by what economists have termed, \"Dutch Disease,\" named for the problems associated with North Sea gas on the economy of the Nether-lands. 5 In basic terms, Dutch Disease oc- curs when resource exports lead to a rise in value of domestic currency against for- eign currencies, which renders other ex-Enhancing Regional Integration to Advance Stability in the Democratic Republic of Congo 90 Journal of Global Development and Peace vember 2011, the United Nations Devel- opment Report 2011 was released, which ranks countries in relation to their Hu- man Development Index (HDI). 12 Ac- cording to the report, the Democratic Re-public of Congo was ranked 187 out of 187 countries. 13 Furthermore, Foreign Policy magazine ranked the Democratic Republic of Congo fourth after Somalia, Chad, and Sudan in their Failed State In-dex. This places the DRC in the critically failed category. 14 Democracy has been established in the DRC and the first democratic elections were held in the country in 2006. Late in 2011, the DRC held their second free elections, and the incumbent president Joseph Kabila maintained his presidency. Although classified as a democracy, Kabila's government is repressive and au-thoritarian. Human Rights Watch pub-lished a scathing report that points out the following: \"There have been disturb- ing signs that Congo's democratic transi-tion is not only fragile, but the newly elected government is brutally restricting democratic space.\" 15 Political opposition, as well as government supporters face harassment and violence. Lack of good governance goes hand-in-hand with lack of transparency and ram-pant corruption. Each year, the World Bank produces a \"Doing Business\" report that ranks countries by ease of doing business, disclosing how straightforward it is to start a business or register property. Out of 183 countries, the DRC was ranked 178. 16 Transparency International also publishes an index each year that ranks countries by how corrupt their pub- The capital of the DRC is located in Kin-shasa, with regional capitals located in eleven provinces. Independence from Belgium was gained on June 30, 1960. However, it has only been since 2001 that the country has been able to begin the re-building process after decades of intra-state conflict and wars with neighboring nations. Despite the unstable peace that has been secured in most of the country, 8 violence still remains present in the east- ern provinces where fighting between mi-litia groups continue. Data reveals that around 45,000 people die every month as a direct or indirect result of the ongoing conflicts, and civilians are often massa-cred, mutilated, and subjected to horrific abuses. The Democratic Republic of Congo has been referred to as a \"country of superla-tives.\" 9 As is the case with many of its fellow African nations, it has been en- dowed with an overflowing basket of natural resources that offers the potential for considerable growth. The World Bank's view states, \"With its immense extraordinary agricultural and mineral re-sources, the DRC has the potential to be-come one of Africa's richest countries and one of the continent's key engines for growth.\" 10 Although the DRC has been identified as a country of superlatives, it has also earned the title of the \"world's worst hu-manitarian crisis.\" Most of the people there do not live to see the age of 50. 11 Poverty, malnutrition, and unnecessary deaths from preventable diseases have created an emergency situation. In No-Enhancing Regional Integration to Advance Stability in the Democratic Republic of Congo 91 Journal of Global Development and Peace these represent a significant part of its economy. Resources include copper, co-balt, diamonds, gold, petroleum and wood. 21 Considering that electronic equipment, homes, and cars cannot be built without some of the minerals and metals found in the DRC, it is plain to see why the World Bank remarked about their potential for immense wealth. There is another source of potential wealth in the DRC that is not part of the mining sector. An article in Afribiz com- mented on their hydroelectric potential; \"The DRC is also home to the single most powerful hydropower site, the Inga site, located on the Congo River.\" 22 The World Energy Council estimates that the Inga Complex can supply up to 50 million households in Africa with electric- ity. They already export power to Zambia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. The ad-vantages created by this resource include greater export diversification, which is desirable since too much of the economy is reliant on minerals, as well as increases in foreign currency reserves. The DRC and Political and Economic Integration In terms of geographical location, the DRC is strategically located in Africa. It straddles both the eastern and western regions, and it is a link between the north and south of Africa. The regions of the DRC are then broken up into provinces. Since the country is as large as it is, and because of its location and regionalization within, the DRC is a member of four dif-ferent regional economic communities. lic sector is perceived to be. The DRC ranked 168 out of 182 countries, showing high levels of corruption, the worst being in the mining sector. 17. In the face of the nation's troubles, the economy continues to maintain a sem-blance of growth. The African Economic Outlook reported that the DRC's econ-omy started to recover from the global economic downturn in 2010. Estimates revealed that real gross domestic product (GDP) growth increased from 2.8 percent to 6.1 percent in 2009, which was mostly driven by the mining sector. This growth then stimulated the services sector and rehabilitation of infrastructure. Sectors that were factors in overall growth were mining (11.8%), construction (10.1%) and wholesale and retail trade (6.3%). Projec- tions show that the economy is expected to grow at around 6.5 percent during the next one to two years. 18 Current data from the World Bank re- ports that Congo's GDP is currently at $13.1 billion and GDP per capita is $199, while GDP growth was at 7.2 percent. 19 The World Trade Organization reported that trade represented 57.4 percent of the Democratic Republic of Congo's GDP from 2006-2008, 20 and amounted to $7.5 billion in 2010. The major exports are mainly minerals and precious metals, and are destined primarily for China, Belgium, and Finland. Imports consist of machin- ery and equipment and the country's ma-jor trading partners are South Africa, Bel-gium, and Zambia. As mentioned previously, the DRC pos- sesses abundant natural resources, and Enhancing Regional Integration to Advance Stability in the Democratic Republic of Congo 92 Journal of Global Development and Peace ture, which are both net positives for the region. However, Ashish Vaidya, an eco-nomics professor who specializes in inter- national trade and development econom- ics, writes that the inclusion of South Af-rica in the SADC has been a mixed bless-ing. He remarks that South Africa has close ties to the West, namely the U.S. and the EU, which offer areas for trade development. On the other hand, be-cause it is such a large economy, smaller member nations at times rely too heavily on South Africa instead of developing their own domestic economies. 26 The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa The provinces in the eastern part of the DRC, such as North and South Kivu, and Province Orientale are linked to the Common Market for Eastern and South- ern Africa (COMESA). The mission statement for this regional arrangement is as follows: \"To provide excellent techni-cal services to COMESA in order to fa- cilitate the region's sustained develop- ment through economic integration.\" 27 COMESA was formed in 1994 and cur-rently has 19 member states. A free trade area was established in 2000 when nine of the member states eliminated tariffs on products originating from COMESA states. In 2009, a customs union was launched. By 2025, COMESA plans to introduce a common currency among member states that will be issued by a central bank. The location of these prov-inces also makes the region a natural trad-ing partner with the East African Com- munity (EAC) of which the DRC is not a The South African Development Com- munity Provinces within the DRC are not well integrated and they lack higher levels of mutual support. The Katanga and Kasai provinces in the eastern and southern parts of the country are well integrated with the southern part of the continent. This is where the SADC operates. The declaration for the formation of the South African Development Community was officially signed in August 1992 in Windhoek, Namibia, and it currently has 15 member states. The SADC mission is \"to promote sustainable and equitable economic growth and socio-economic development through efficient productive systems, deeper co-operation and integra- tion, good governance, and durable peace and security, so that the region emerges as a competitive and effective player in international relations and the world economy.\" 23 By 2015, the SADC plans to boost integration and establish a common market. Their strategy also outlines plans for a monetary union by 2016, and a sin- gle currency by 2018. In 2008, the SADC launched a free trade area that included the majority of its member states. The DRC is not yet a part of the free trade area due to its weak economy. The trade balance of the SADC is currently heavily in favor of South Africa. 24 With its GDP at $363.9 billion and exports at around $85.8 billion, South Africa is the continent's largest and strongest economy. 25 South Africa also offers political stability, as well as good transportation infrastruc-Enhancing Regional Integration to Advance Stability in the Democratic Republic of Congo 93 Journal of Global Development and Peace Established in 1976, there is very little information available regarding the CEPGL. Member nations consist of the DRC, Rwanda, and Burundi. Due to warring between member states, this REC has been mostly inactive, but there is now a revitalization movement within the pri-vate sectors of the member states. 31 This renewed collaboration will work to en-hance cross-border trade and develop the regional economy. This REC has a tumultuous history on the one hand, however, on the other hand, there is potential for success in its revitalization. Regarding Rwanda, during and after the 1994 genocide, fighting spilled over into the DRC. Even after the conflict was officially over, the eastern provinces of the DRC remained under Tutsi-led control, which was backed by the Rwandan Government. The eastern provinces are rich in mineral deposits and Rwanda used their strategic positioning to loot minerals in the DRC. The New York Times reported, \"During these 12 years of Rwandan control, the mineral- rich provinces have been economically integrated into Rwanda. During this time, Congo's governments have been preoccu-pied with internal and external wars else-where, and have been unable to combat foreign control of the eastern provinces, a thousand miles from the capital, Kin- shasa.\" 32 Since the minerals are part of the economies of both countries, CEPGL provides a forum for both countries to enhance their economic cooperation, with the additional benefit of peace building in a conflict region. The United States Insti-tute of Peace stated in a briefing, \"A revi- talized CEPGL would integrate regional member. The EAC will be mentioned again in a subsequent section. The Economic Community of Central African States The following provinces in DRC are more integrated with the central part of Africa: Bandudu, Bas Congo, Equateur, and Kinshasa. Thus, the DRC is also a member of the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS). This particular Regional Economic Commu-nity (REC) has had a shaky past. It was established in 1983, but was not fully functional until 1985. However, due to warring between member nations and non-payment of dues by members, it re-mained inactive for many years. 28 Even after the revitalization of the ECCAS, it continues to struggle with its objectives in furthering integration. Lack of solidarity continues to hinder progress, and con- flicts undermine efforts for member na- tions to develop internally. One of the greatest stumbling blocks has been the lack of transport infrastructure within the region, as this hampers movement of goods and people across borders. 29 How- ever, the lack of peace, and political insta-bility remain the biggest obstacles. As a counteractive measure, ECCAS estab-lished the Council for Peace and Security in Central Africa (COPAX). Out of this came the creation of a peacekeeping force for military intervention in central Africa, which appears to be its only substantial achievement to date. 30 The Economic Community of the Great Lakes Enhancing Regional Integration to Advance Stability in the Democratic Republic of Congo 94 Journal of Global Development and Peace tablish a common market. The EAC vi- sion and mission states, \"The Vision of EAC is a prosperous, competitive, secure, stable and politically united East Africa; and the Mission is to widen and deepen Economic, Political, Social and Culture integration in order to improve the qual-ity of life of the people of East Africa through increased competitiveness, value added production, trade and invest-ments.\" 35 For the most part, the EAC has largely been successful in its economic integra-tion and Hilary Clinton praised it for be-ing the most successful REC in Sub-Saharan Africa, referring to it as a model bloc. 36 Trade among members has in- creased and the EAC is continuing on its path towards a monetary union. Consid- ering the EAC's success and trajectory, as well as the membership of Rwanda, who has economic ties with the DRC, it makes sense for the DRC to join this regional bloc. Overlapping Membership As was previously mentioned, there are over 30 RTAs in Africa, and most coun-tries are members of more than two re-gional blocs. This overlapping member-ship tends to create inefficiencies, as well as hinder deeper economic integration. Several disadvantages to multiple mem- conflicting poli-cies and program implementation. 37 armed forces under one command, lay the foundation for police and judicial co-operation and harmonize economic poli- cies/regulation. Some participants be- lieved that the CEPGL could provide the framework for a viable regional common market.\" 33 Steps to Enhance Economic Integra-tion Recent statistics have shown that the DRC is much better integrated with the SADC and COMESA, and that their ex-ports are slanted towards the eastern and southern regions of Africa. Furthermore, considering how little information is available on CEPGL and ECCAS, it dem-onstrates how these two RECs are unsta- ble and poorly integrated. It has been ar- gued that the recently renewed effort to revive CEPGL is being driven by external forces, rather than occurring organically. 34 It is therefore recommended that the DRC should consider withdrawing from CEPGL and ECCAS and concentrate on the SADC and COMESA, which provide more potential for economic growth, ac- cess to foreign markets, and improved political stability. In addition, the DRC should consider applying for membership to the East African Community. The East African Community The East African Community is a re- gional intergovernmental organization that consists of Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, and Burundi. It was established in 2000, and by 2005, the EAC estab-lished a customs union. In 2009, the pro- tocol was signed by member states to es-Enhancing Regional Integration to Advance Stability in the Democratic Republic of Congo 95 Journal of Global Development and Peace government and focus on genuine de- mocratization. This would require the current regime to alter its authoritarian policies, and work to uphold the rule of law. Aside from policy changes, the cen-tral government needs to establish greater hegemony over the provinces that still remain under the control of warlords and militia groups. There also needs to be more transparency, and corruption must not be tolerated at any level. The mining industry offers the most hope for economic growth in the DRC. It also serves as the backbone of the current economy, and represents its most traded commodities. These minerals and pre-cious metals are what make the DRC competitive in the RECs. However, in order to be profitable, the mining indus- try must continue to undergo an overhaul. In 2007, the government of the DRC be-gan a review of all mining contracts, since some contracts were found to be abusive with inflated transaction costs that robbed the DRC of revenues. 40 Deputy Minister of Mines Victor Kasongo was quoted as saying, \"The review had re- vealed the extent to which some contracts were not viable or had in some way failed on feasibility, adherence to the mining code, or had otherwise not realized the terms of business agreed upon in the out-set.\" 41 Upon review of the contracts, many were renegotiated to provide better terms for the DRC, as well as local mine operators. The DRC government has also commit-ted to implementing the Extractive Indus-tries Transparency Initiative Plus, Plus (EITI++). According to the World bank, Essentially, multiple memberships create more bureaucracy, and are financially draining for a country. Furthermore, conflicting policies of one RTA can hin- der trade with another. Considering the inefficiencies related to multiple memberships, there has been collaboration between the SADC, CO-MESA, and EAC, to harmonize their policies towards merging these three RECs to create something called the Tri- partite. The goal of the Tripartite is to establish a free trade area that covers all three RECs to establish a larger market with a single economic space. 38 The merg- ing of the Tripartite would be in line with the Lagos Treaty that aims to reduce the 14 recognized RECs down to five through mergers. \"According to the La- gos Treaty, 'Geographical proximity, eco-nomic interdependence, commonality of language and culture, history of co- operation, and shared resources should define REC membership'.\" 39 Enhancing the Political and Eco- nomic Integration of the DRC Although the DRC is already a member of several RECs, domestic issues, some of which were previously mentioned, have hampered their integration into regional blocs. In order for the DRC to deepen integration, these issues must be ad- dressed and resolved. Of course, as the DRC's difficulties are complex and exist at many levels, there is no silver bullet for the nation's woes. In terms of governance, the DRC must work towards strengthening their central Enhancing Regional Integration to Advance Stability in the Democratic Republic of Congo 96 Journal of Global Development and Peace invested nearly $1 billion into the project. Mr. Latsoucab\u00e9 Fall of the World Energy Council was quoted as saying that the Inga Complex is a \"unique opportunity to promote economic independence, peace, and prosperity in Africa.\" Conclusion Based on the point that the DRC has a strategic geophysical location in Africa, it is vital to the success of the continent. The DRC, as well as its neighbors, realize this, which is why it is linked to each re-gion of Africa, and integrated into re-gional economic communities. Further-more, considering its endowment in natu-ral resources, potential for immense wealth generation from revenues, as well as trade exists. The DRC should focus on integration in the eastern and southern regions and fur- ther its ties with the SADC and CO- MESA. It may also pursue membership with EAC, which has been largely suc-cessful in its integration. Future plans to merge the Tripartite and harmonize trade policies will create an economic power-house in Africa if it continues on a path similar to that of the EAC. If the DRC desires to enhance its integra-tion with RECs, it will need to continue to strive for good governance, a stronger central government based on rule of law, and put an end to domestic conflicts. One solution is to continue to reform the mining sector to collect taxes and fees and generate revenue, which can only be done by eradicating corruption and through transparency initiatives. This \"The EITI ++ seeks to support commit- ted governments, notably in Africa, in im-plementing good policy and practice along the entire natural resources value chain, i.e. the entire natural resources de-velopment process.\" 42 EITI++ is a coali- tion of governments, the World Bank, investors, civil society organizations, and NGOs. They provide policy advice and technical expertise to improve extractive resource management, and are involved in every stage from how access to the re- source is granted to how revenues are spent for sustainable growth. In theory, if the revenues are spent on sustainable growth, infrastructure, and poverty reduction, the DRC will enhance integration with RECs. In turn, eco- nomic integration will provide further sta- bility in the region, while aiding member countries in areas of deficiency, such as the building of transport and infrastruc- ture. Lastly, the focus has been on the mining industry. However, the DRC needs to di- versify if they want to be more competi- tive. At the moment, their best option for diversification is in the Inga Complex project that was mentioned earlier. With the potential to supply 50 million house-holds in Africa with electricity, the up-sides for the domestic economy, as well as for the RECs are immense. The DRC has already requested assistance and co- operation from SADC countries that al-ready benefit from the Inga Power Com-plex, thus furthering integration within this REC. Nations in West Africa, such as Nigeria have disclosed their plans to purchase power, and the World Bank has Enhancing Regional Integration to Advance Stability in the Democratic Republic of Congo 97 Journal of Global Development and Peace revenue, with the aid of EITI++ must be applied to sustainable growth and poverty reduction measures. Furthermore, inte- gration with the Tripartite can also help to fill in the gaps in regards to lack of in-frastructure, skilled laborers, and knowl-edge sharing. Lastly, the end goal of po-litical and economic integration is peace and regional stability, however, in a re-gion where peace is intermittent, eco-nomic integration is also the means to that end.

Abstract Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs) are a relatively new form of targeted aid in the fight against global poverty. CCTs act as both a social safety net, and as a mechanism for in- vestments in human capital for longer-term visions. They are based on the simple idea to provide \"the poor money that will allow them to be less poor today, but condition it on behaviors that will give their children a better start in life.\" This paper is a broad in-troductory overview of CCT programs. It looks at the philosophical, political, eco-nomic, and socio-cultural bases of CCTs. It briefly recounts the experiences of two of the most successful practitioners of CCT programs, Brazil and Mexico. Finally, it looks at the main features that are part of all CCT programs, and the various differences be-tween countries within those features. It then goes on to rudimentarily explore some criticisms of the programs. The paper concludes that CCT programs, if well designed and implemented effectively can be a powerful tool to alleviate future poverty, while attaining the short-term goals of the UN Millennium Declaration and MDGs. Journal of Global Development and Peace 106 Journal of Global Development and Peace tional community. It has attracted the best economists from around the world to develop strategies. Anti-poverty causes have attracted celebrities like Bono, and made academics into celebrities, like Jeffery Sachs. Multilateral agencies like the UN, the World Bank, and the Inter-national Monetary Fund have made it their crusading cause. Whatever the causes of the \"culture of poverty,\" perhaps the most salient feature of it is that it implies that not only are poor families currently poor, but they will remain so in the future. Called the \"cycle of poverty\" or the \"poverty trap,\" this idea contradicts our very basic notions of justice, equity, and fair opportunity. This is why the transmission of poverty through generations, \"intergenerational poverty\" has become a fundamental problem for the modern world, and a much researched and debated topic amongst political economists. It was only in the mid-1990s that a new approach to poverty alleviation began tak- ing hold. This approach was not focused on the supply-side of the poverty prob-lems (access to better education and healthcare, state-sponsored creation of employment, food subsidies, etc). The approach, called Conditional Cash Trans-fers (CCTs) instead focused on the de- mand side of the development problem. This deceptively simple, yet elegant idea, to \"give the poor money that will allow them to be less poor today, but condition it on behaviors that will give their chil-dren a better start in life\" 2 is called Condi- tional Cash Transfer. Within a short span of a decade and a half, more than 30 At the turn of the millennium, in Septem- ber 2000, the 189 member states of the United Nations made a historic pledge, \"to free our fellow men, women and chil- dren from the abject and dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty, to which more than a billion of them are currently subjected.\" 1 The passionate tone of the pledge, enshrined in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, not only echoed other historic declarations such as the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but it also built upon many other foundational documents as well. It adopted a bold vision of reducing poverty by half, infant mortality by two-thirds, and maternal mortality by three-quarters around the world. It also set a deadline - that the achievements were to be achieved by 2015. Yet, according to World Bank data, over 2.1 billion people worldwide live on less than two dollars a day, classified as the relative poverty line. Of those, over 880 million are the absolute poor, eking out an existence at the edge of humanity. They survive on less than one dollar a day. The global economic crisis and rising food and fuel prices may further damage some of the gains made since the 1990s, pushing more people in to poverty in the short run. It is thus more imperative than ever to look at the different ways that governments and the international com- munity are dealing with the problem of eradicating poverty in the long run, and meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as the deadline looms. Fighting poverty has thus become a major agenda for governments and the interna-Rewarding Good Behavior with Cash: The Basis, Experiences and Features of Conditional Cash Transfers 107 Journal of Global Development and Peace For the purposes of this paper, condi-tional cash transfers (CCTs) are defined as payments made to poor households on the condition that those households in-vest in the human capital of their children in certain, pre-specified ways. 3 The basic assumption is that while direct cash trans-fers alleviate current poverty in the family by providing much needed monetary re-lief among the extremely poor, the pro- gram will also increase the likelihood of the next generation being able to break the cycle of poverty, by investing in hu-man capital formation via education and health requirements. Political Basis Firstly, as all UN member states are signa- tories of the Universal Declaration of Hu-man Rights, the main political justifica-tion of CCT programs would be the Dec- laration itself. The 26th article of the UN Declaration of Human Rights affirms the \"right to a free and compulsory education with the goal of strengthening human rights and fundamental freedom,\" while also recognizing that \"everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family.\" 4 Thus, in the developing world, condi- tional cash transfers can have an immedi- ate appeal among the local citizenry. As we will see in Mexico, even after the fall of Ernesto Zedillo's government, which had instituted the first CCT programs in the country, his successor, Vicente Fox not only continued, but also expanded the program, albeit under a different name. In countries have now adopted some form of CCT. This paper is a broad overview of CCT programs as currently implemented. Even though CCT programs are relatively new, there is a trove of academic research in various fields, being most prominently examined in political economy. There are also many statistical analyses of the im-pacts of CCT activity. Because many CCT programs began as pilots, there were both treatment and control groups in these studies, making it one of the most heavily researched, monitored, evaluated and documented social programs in recent times. Furthermore, many governments (in particular Mexico) have put entire datasets online for scrutiny by any out- sider. This enables the program to con- tinuously adapt to criticisms, and tweak the program to certain recommendations. As the program is continuously evolving, many papers can become quickly out- dated or superseded by more recent re-search. Prominently, the World Bank and the In- ter-American Development Bank heavily promote these programs. They too have released several documents and annual reviews of the program. This paper is heavily indebted to a World Bank Policy Research Report titled, \"Conditional Cash Transfers: Reducing Present and Future Poverty,\" that was published in 2009. It is, to the author's knowledge, the most com-prehensive document of its nature that broadly outlines the global experiment with CCT programs. Basis Rewarding Good Behavior with Cash: The Basis, Experiences and Features of Conditional Cash Transfers 108 Journal of Global Development and Peace particularly of food, fuel and electricity for the poorest citizens. However, many of these subsidy programs were consid- ered poorly designed and inefficiently im- plemented. Corruption was rampant. Hoarding of essentials to artificially in-flate the prices of these essentials was widespread. Politicians often were gate-keepers of such programs, whereby they would dispense the benefits to whom they saw fit. Many of the poorest people were also left out of the schemes for vari- ous other reasons. Thus, it has been ar-gued that CCT programs are often imple-mented as part of a broader reform of social services, regularly leading to the elimination of poorly targeted and ineffi-cient programs. 6 Many other social welfare programs rely heavily on social workers or government bureaucrats. This increases the chances of leakages and of corruption in aid delivery. Most CCT programs increase efficiency and decrease corruption by using a cen-tralized system of design and delivery of benefits, with local administration and bureaucracy used for implementation. This means better targeting (as local ad-ministrations are better able to evaluate incidences of poverty in their areas), by making the delivery of benefits directly to the beneficiary through a check that is delivered directly. This greatly limits cor- ruption. Compared to traditional programs, CCTs also have low operational costs, even though that cost stil l remains high. As we can see below, the financing of CCT pro-grams has six components. Brazil, the CCT programs that were inde- pendently launched by municipalities in mid-1980s not only withstood the consti- tutional changes of 1988, but in fact, the constitution further enshrined the per-cepts of redistributive justice, until the mid-1990s, when the government took it upon itself to commandeer the Bolsa Fa-milia program and expand it nationwide. However, in many Latin American coun- tries with a sizeable middle class, the sense that the poor are getting cash that they do not deserve remains strong. With a solid middle class in many countries, politicians cannot afford to alienate these voters. In such cases, CCTs can convince the citizenry that the poor are not merely getting handouts but are being rewarded for \"good behavior.\" This CCT model can be advantageous in political contexts, which are hostile to redistribution, as re-cipients have to demonstrate certain atti- tudes to be deserving. 5 Economic Basis To invest in any social program is a sig- nificant governmental decision that re-quires a cost benefit analysis, since the resources used in one area could easily be used in another. Thus, it is never an easy decision to make. And thus, for any CCT program to be accepted and to have a meaningful impact, it is necessary to see how CCT programs compare to other programs of social welfare. In many countries, the introduction of CCT programs was in response to already existing social welfare programs. Most common among them were subsidies, Rewarding Good Behavior with Cash: The Basis, Experiences and Features of Conditional Cash Transfers 109 Journal of Global Development and Peace system.8 This in itself is also good as ac- cess to credit is essential in increasing the chances of poor families making it out of poverty. Similarly, one of the primary aims of CCT programs is to act as a social safety net. As stated in the introduction, any eco-nomic downturn affects the poorest the most. CCT benefits can act as a shield during such times by providing much needed cushioning. Not only do global economic factors disproportionately im-pact the poor, there are a host of other factors that can provide a shock to poor families. They include natural disasters such as floods and droughts, eviction, violence to a member of the family, unex-pected diseases, death of a wage-earning member of the family etc. CCT programs can be designed to address particular situations with careful targeting and proper calibration of conditionalities. They ensure that in spite of such shocks, even the most vulnerable of the poor, the children, can still go to school, meet basic nutritional and health needs, and increase their capabilities to become productive members of society in the future. Socio-cultural Basis Since CCT programs have been imple-mented in more than 30 countries, a wide variety of literature is available on social and cultural contexts of such programs, how they vary, and how specific pro-grams have adjusted to meet particular needs. First, let us look at the gender dimension of CCTs. Many (by some estimates Costing conditional cash transfer programs usu- ally involves an analysis of six major expenditure components: (1) targeting costs, which usually involve geographical targeting and proxy means tests, (2) costs of implementing and managing conditionalities, (3) monitoring and evaluation expenses, (4) logistical costs of delivering cash, (5) costs of supporting the supply of human capital services, and (6) the private costs to beneficiaries from participation in the programs, including their costs of compliance. 7 As we can see, in each of the six catego-ries, governments can choose how much to spend according to their priorities and capabilities. For example, while the Mex-ico CCT program spends heavily on monitoring compliance with conditionali-ties, Brazil is less strict about it. Similarly, costs vary greatly depending on the exist- ing infrastructure of government and their presence at the local level. Targeting costs in themselves vary from around 4% to 15%. It is up to each government to decide and customize what their priorities are. This makes CCT programs a highly malleable system that can be adapted as per the need of each country. On a much longer-term note, the very concept of CCT programming is to en-hance human capital for the future. This means that CCT programs can play an essential role for building a sustainable market in the future with capable human resources. Because they often transfer benefits di-rectly to a recipient's bank account, an ancillary outcome of these programs is that they increase the poor's incorpora- tion in to credit markets and the banking Rewarding Good Behavior with Cash: The Basis, Experiences and Features of Conditional Cash Transfers 110 Journal of Global Development and Peace bers, resentment may be generated. This will particularly be the case in communi-ties where social cohesion is already weak, for example, in the case of rural India. A CCT program in rural India that targets only the lower-strata of the caste system will inevitably breed resentment among the upper strata. Thus, it would be wiser in such communities to use gender as the primary criteria with universal coverage for women who deliver babies at govern- ment health posts. Upper-caste people who can afford private healthcare inevita-bly choose so, but poorer households among the upper-caste can benefit from such services too, even if they are better off than their lower-caste neighbors. Similarly, engaging the local community (particularly local elders in rural areas) can have a strengthening effect on social co- hesion. However, care has to be taken that this does not lead to exclusion of those most needy. Origins The two most studied and widely praised instances of CCT programs are being im- plemented in Brazil and Mexico. Both programs have some key differences that shall be reviewed individually below. While Brazil's program evolved more or-ganically from the 1980s onwards and in a much more decentralized way, Mexico's program was adapted and imposed by the central government. Brazil's target had been the urban poor, whereas Mexico tar-geted the rural poor, though both eventu-ally widened the social safety net. Adher-ence to conditionalities also varies be-tween the two countries. As different as they are in some ways, in many others around 70%) of the CCT programs iden- tify female heads of household as the pri-mary beneficiaries of their programs. This means that money is delivered to them in their name and they control the cash. Many studies have shown that when women control the money, they often spend it more on family needs than men do. This has been the guiding rationale for many social programs including micro-credit lending. When women control incomes, they not only tend to spend it wisely, but the proc- ess also empowers them and increases their sense of self-esteem. This can have a powerful effect, particularly in countries where gender discrimination is high and where girls, from the outset, are taught to think of themselves solely in the terms of \"objects for marriage.\" The involvement of local communities in program design can have an impact on social cohesion too. Thus, when design- ing the program, it is essential to under- stand local communities and their culture and design the program with due consid-eration of such factors. When some poorer (and thought of as inferior) mem-bers of a community get benefits that by- pass the other relatively better-off mem-Rewarding Good Behavior with Cash: The Basis, Experiences and Features of Conditional Cash Transfers 111 Journal of Global Development and Peace from 1930 to 1985. During these years, even though there was significant invest-ment in social welfare (particularly fo- cused on workers), poverty remained a blight for Brazil. In early 1980s, unionized workers and intellectuals started challeng-ing the ossified Brazilian political system. This led to a confrontation with the mili-tary regime of the time throughout 1984, which led to the emergence of new ideas of social justice. Emerging from these basic principles, the Bolsa Escola Program was started in the Bras\u00edlia and Campinas municipalities in 1995 by Governor Buarque and Mayor Teixeira, respectively. 9 These programs targeted poorer neighborhoods in each of their municipalities. They were already counting school attendance and health metrics among their main conditionalities. The program was proving to be very popular, and many other municipalities were adopting the program, tweaking the deliverables (in terms of how much money the beneficiaries would receive) to the conditionalities (e.g. the percentage of attendance levels in classes). Federal support to the Bolsa Escola be-gan in 1998, with the government provid-ing 50% of the required funds to finance the program in different municipalities. By 2003, the newly elected President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva made it a centerpiece of his administration's efforts to fight poverty. This new policy was so success-ful that according to the World Bank data, during President Lula's first term in office (2003-2006), poverty rates in Brazil fell by more than 27%. While President Cardoso was the first to federalize the program, they are quite similar. Both Brazil and Mexico focus on the development of hu-man capital, with a particular emphasis on education and health. The conditionalities of each country are also strikingly close; both require between 80-85% attendance at schools, monthly medical checkups, and attendance of meetings that focus on women's empowerment and other social programs. The Bolsa Escola/Familia Experience In terms of numbers of beneficiaries, the Bolsa Familia Program is by far the larg-est conditional cash transfer model in the developing world. Although officially started in 2003, the Bolsa Familia Pro- gram (BFP) has a long and interesting his-tory of its own. To understand the pro-gram fully, one has to understand the po-litical context for the development of the program and its gradual evolution from a decentralized, ad-hoc mechanism to a highly centralized operation, with signifi- cant input and participation of decentral- ized bodies. The foundations of the BFP were laid during the political upheavals of the 1980s. Brazil had been ruled by non- democratic populist or military rulers Rewarding Good Behavior with Cash: The Basis, Experiences and Features of Conditional Cash Transfers 112 Journal of Global Development and Peace poverty crisis. Levy came up with an idea that was considered so frivolous by many in the administration that he piloted his program in secrecy. 11 ... [Levy] launched a pilot project in three cities in the southern state of Campeche, using the da-tabases of beneficiaries of two existing subsidized milk and tortilla programs... The pilot project had two features that broke with the tradition of Mexican social programs: the assistance consisted of direct monetary transfers instead of foodstuffs, and it required people in vulnerable groups (pregnant women, lactating mothers and infants) to get regular medical checkups. 12 The program was called PROGRESA, and the name was changed to Oportuni-dades by the new administration of Vin- cente Fox. By 2006, already around a quarter of the population was enrolled in the program. Evaluations conducted in 2004 showed that among other things, beneficiaries of scholarships increased by 28% in elementary schools and more than 40% in secondary schools. The number of students enrolled in schools increased by more than 100% each year as the pro- gram net expanded, leading to a decrease in failure rates among students by 13% in rural areas, and 20% in urban areas, a 17% reduction in school drop outs in ru-ral zones, and almost 10% in urban zones (compared with 1997 figures), combined with an 11% reduction in maternal mor- tality, as well as a 2% decrease in infant mortality, and many other improvements in indicators of health and nutrition. 13 Problem Identification and Design The first part of any conditional cash there were many different CCT programs being simultaneously implemented when Lula took office. Lula is also credited with (a transfer to compensate for the phasing out of the federal gas subsidy program). He also cre-ated a new ministry, the Ministry of Social Development, to streamline the BFP, thereby greatly reducing administrative costs and bureaucratic complexity. 10 This integration achieved the desired re-sults. Henceforth, the priorities of the program targeting the neediest of the population and at human capital forma-tion as a long-term strategy for poverty alleviation. The PROGRESA/Oportunidades Ex- perience It was in the wake of the \"tequila eco- nomic crisis\" that Mexico began its ex- periment with CCT programs. Already in the early 1990s, economic indicators painted a poor picture of Mexico. A third of its population lived in extreme poverty, an affliction that was more severe in the rural areas. The government provided so-cial welfare mainly in the form of subsi-dies on bread, tortillas and milk. The pro-gram was widely lampooned as being \"inefficient, badly targeted and corrupt\" in the media. Then, in 1994, the peso crashed and the economy subsequently shrank by 6%, pushing more people into extreme levels of poverty. President Ze-dillo recruited the help of economist Santiago Levy, an undersecretary of fi-nance in the government to come up with radical solutions to resolve the growing Rewarding Good Behavior with Cash: The Basis, Experiences and Features of Conditional Cash Transfers 113 Journal of Global Development and Peace With these problems in mind, PRO- GRESA was designed to shift money from the food subsidy program by di- rectly giving cash to the poor in rural ar- eas. This would mean that the families could use the money by making decisions on which food to buy. Assuming that the price of staples would be cheaper in rural areas, they could use the money on other items (beans for protein, for instance). The conditions required to be met were 85% attendance rate at schools, regular health check-ups for targeted children (thus ensuring vaccinations), health check-ups for pregnant and lactating women, and attendance of regular meetings on health and sanitation. Another example of specific targeting in- cludes the gender disparity in child liter- acy. To counter this specific problem, several Islamic countries have used gen-der targeting to enhance girls' enrollment. These include Bangladesh 15, Pakistan and Yemen. In Cambodia, the problem was that girls were dropping out as they reached higher levels of education. To ensure that the brightest girls would stay in schools, they received a government scholarship based on their performance. transfer is the program design. For this, it is essential to first identify the problem and to design a solution that is custom- ized to solve the problem. CCTs are par- ticularly effective in this customization because they can isolate a behavior, and make it conditional that the behavioral requirement be met in order to receive any cash transfers. To take an example, in Mexico in 1997, the problem identified was the crash of the peso in 1994, and the subsequent shrinking of the economy by 6%. Presi-dent Ernesto Zedillo, himself an econo-mist, rightly identified that this was going to effect the poorest most. 14 In rural Mexico, this would mean several things. Firstly, the poor may be forced to pull their children out from schools and in- stead use them for labor to supplement their income, either helping with farming or with other income-generating activities. This would not only mean more child la- bor, but also under-education, which would make it more difficult for the chil-dren to overcome poverty when they be- come adults. Similarly, the poor would also have to cut back on their nutritional needs, damaging the long-term well being of their children. Mexico already had a subsidy on foods where the government subsidized food to the poor, providing tortillas and wheat at a cheaper price. However, the food subsidy program was commonly considered a failure because of its leakages, inefficiency, and corruption. Similarly, pregnant women could forego going to a hospital or health facility post-delivery, risking the lives of both the mother and the child. Rewarding Good Behavior with Cash: The Basis, Experiences and Features of Conditional Cash Transfers 114 Journal of Global Development and Peace munity. For example, for a family with only one child whose parent is taken sick for a long period, it would be unreason- able to expect an 85% attendance rate. Conditionalities should also be based on access to services. To expect monthly check-ups for pregnant women when the hospital is more than a day away will not only increase the risks for the intended beneficiary, it increases the costs she has to incur to adhere to the conditionality, and this in turn, becomes an obstacle to participation in the program. Thus, when designing conditionalities, one has to take into account not only the desired out-comes, but also, the existing infrastruc-ture, ensuring that the conditionalities are not inhibiting, but rather encouraging the participation of families in the program. Delivery As mentioned earlier, the delivery mecha- nism of benefits can have a significant impact not only on program design, but also on program implementation and par- ticipation of the extreme poor. There are many institutional hurdles for providing the beneficiary with the benefits of par-ticipation and compliance, including in-formation management and databases, and access to banks and government line agencies. CCT programs often differentiate pay- ments by the number of children in the eligible age range, but otherwise have rather simple benefit structures. Only two differentiate by poverty level, none by cost of living, and few by age/grade or gender of the student. 17 However, one of In India, to tackle the problem of a large number of women in rural areas not go-ing to a health clinic to deliver babies, an- other program called Janani Suraksha Yo- jana (JSY) was implemented in 2007 to reduce the numbers of maternal and neo-natal deaths. Recent studies have found that JSY payment was associated with a reduction of 3-7 prenatal deaths per 1000 pregnancies and 2-3 neonatal deaths per 1000 live births. 16 Targeting A crucial element of CCT programs is the targeting. Targeting is important because governments want to ensure that the right people are receiving the benefits of the program. Almost all CCT programs target the bottom segment of the population. However, the population segment largely varies. The CCT program in Ecuador tar-gets 40% of the population, Brazil and Mexico target about 20% of the popula- tion, while Cambodia only targets 1% of the population. Most often, it is the most vulnerable population segment, the extremely poor, orphans, and girls in societies where gen-der discrimination is prevalent that are targeted. Conditionality The key to CCT programs is to have en- forceable conditionalities that promote human capital building, hence making the design of conditionalities extremely im-portant. Sometimes, conditionalities that are too rigid can have a detrimental effect, further marginalizing members of a com-Rewarding Good Behavior with Cash: The Basis, Experiences and Features of Conditional Cash Transfers 115 Journal of Global Development and Peace (and thus credit to the poor), maintain a large database, and create national identity cards. Evaluation CCT programs are usually finalized after piloting, which includes assessments and adjustments based on feedback. The pro-grams are complex and therefore need to be locally contextualized. Usually, when the program is introduced, there are some communities that are especially targeted. These are the treatment groups. At the same time, data is also rigorously main-tained for communities where the CCT programs are to be implemented in the next phase (a year or so later), which is the control group. It is this feature of CCT programs that makes it ideal to study the impact of social welfare pro-grams, and to carefully evaluate the changes occurring before and during the program. Some countries, like Mexico, have posted all their data online and en-courage outside groups, academics, uni-versities and think tanks to evaluate their programs and actively seek recommenda- tions. Similarly, organizations like the World Bank are increasingly seeing CCT programs as an effective strategy in the fight against poverty. Thus, multilateral agencies have also spent considerable time and resources studying the CCT phenomenon. Criticisms of CCT Programs Criticisms against CCT programs have been remarkably muted. The most com-mon forms of criticism goes along the lines that the program is not cost-the criticisms of the program has been that it increases the fertility rate, especially in countries with already high fertility. To counter this, many programs cap the number of children who can benefit from the program. Payments are usually made either bi-monthly or quarterly to decrease the transaction costs and administrative bur-dens. Payments, as mentioned earlier, are usually made to the female head of household and only in certain scholarship programs are they made to students themselves. The method of payment also varies greatly among countries. For example, Brazil makes payments directly to debit cards and cash can be withdrawn at banks, ATM machines, or lottery sales points. Turkey uses the state bank, and benefici-aries receive the payment in cash, with clients going to tellers to withdraw funds. Mexico uses a 'low -tech' solution com- bining paying through community centers or government offices, such as the post office. In Kenya, payments are made through the post office, but experimenta-tion is being undertaken to see if pay-ments can be made through cell-phones, which have proliferated in Kenya and are used for other social programs. In Tanza-nia, payments are made through a govern- ment representation. 18 The existing level of technology and ac-cess of the recipients should be taken into mind when designing the method of de-livery. The method of delivery and also monitoring can provide a country with incentives to increase access to banking Rewarding Good Behavior with Cash: The Basis, Experiences and Features of Conditional Cash Transfers 116 Journal of Global Development and Peace ity of participants. Despite the argument being self-defeating in that a literate workforce is inherently superior to an il- literate workforce, or that human capital development is a pre-requisite for sus-tained market growth, it does raise an im-portant challenge for development ex-perts and policy makers. It is a reminder that focusing solely on the demand-side of the development equation is in itself not a sufficient criterion for either eco- nomic growth or the escape from poverty. Equal emphasis must be given to the sup-ply-side, especially in countries where ab-senteeism among teachers and health workers is high, where infrastructure is poor, access by people living under the poverty line is difficult, and communities are marginalized from the formal employ- ment and banking sectors, as well as be- ing socially discriminated against. One of the reasons why CCT programs have been more successful in countries like Brazil and Mexico is that these countries already boast a strong middle class, and that infrastructural development over the past half a century has been significant. Conclusion As with any social welfare programs, CCT programs are complex structures. Yet in a remarkably short period of time since state-level adoption of the programs (1997), they have been emulated by many countries, with more joining the band- wagon every year. Because of the relative short period that the program has been active, it is difficult to predict the long-term consequences of CCT programs. However, they have succeeded remarka- bly in two ways: by providing a social effective, and that the returns are lower than other development projects, such as developing infrastructure and providing other public services. Some opponents also say that CCT programs are more dif-ficult to target and deliver than other public expenditure programs. A com-monly used argument is that CCT pro-grams provide the wrong incentives lead-ing to reduced work, dependency, and lower self-esteem. Another set of arguments is against the setting of conditionalities themselves. Many believe that it is wrong to further burden the poor and think that this re-flects on the patronizing attitude of the state and the elite. Yet another set of ar-guments that oppose CCT are set on the basis that it is unsustainable, and that the rewards of human capital enhancement are too slow and not guaranteed, whereas the money used in CCT programs could push a country into debt and dependency. Corruption is also a commonly used argu-ment, and leaders promoting CCT are often labeled as populists. A common criticism that is often used against CCT programs is that while these programs have significantly achieved the short-term goals of providing a social safety net, and other increased indicators (school enrollment, graduation rates, health and nutrition indicators), there is as yet, no evidence of any long term benefits of the program, i.e. no proof that the par- ticipating children and students will be able to escape the poverty trap. Some studies have pointed out statistically insig-nificant impacts, such as increase in height, improved performance classroom achievement tests, or greater employabil-Rewarding Good Behavior with Cash: The Basis, Experiences and Features of Conditional Cash Transfers 117 Journal of Global Development and Peace safety net for the extremely poor and other vulnerable groups, and in facilitat-ing the achievement of the MDGs by in- creasing literacy, gender equity, infant mortality, maternal mortality and other core goals. The experience in both Brazil and Mexico shows us that CCT programs can be highly effective, far more comprehensive, and attained in a cheaper and more effi- cient way. Those experiences show us the resilience and malleability of CCT pro-grams, as do their adaptations across Latin America and other continents. While there are some criticisms of the program, most reports show a high corre-lation between objectives and achieve-ments, at least in the short run in CCT programs. It will be interesting to observe how CCT programs, already one of the most studied social welfare strategies, will be translated in the remainder of the world and if, within the foreseeable future, they will be able to eradicate what Ma-hatma Gandhi has called \"the worst kind of violence\" - poverty.

Abstract As nations address their immediate concerns of population growth, alternative energy sources, economic stability and national security, the problem of water scarcity looms. The 2010 decision by the United Nations to include water as a basic human right serves as a catalyst for change in long-standing agreements and practices with respect to re-source distribution. Change is not without consequence; the economic, political, and social impact of any change to the supply and availability of a coveted resource may very well be met with escalating tensions among states. This paper examines the theo-retical concepts of resource conflict and distributive justice within the context of sus-tainability and the right to water. A case study of Egypt and Ethiopia serve as a frame-work from which to examine how economic and political forces can influence the distri- bution of natural resources within the region. 123 Journal of Global Development and Peace agree to their terms. Egypt maintained its position on the Nile stating that access to water was, and still is, a matter of national security. As Ethiopia strives to reduce poverty and participate with other devel-oping countries in the global market, it has begun a series of large-scale alterna-tive and sustainable energy projects. These power capabilities have largely been gained through the construction of large-scale dams such as the Great Millen- nium Dam, and have been met with op- position by Egypt, Sudan and Eritrea, as well as the World Bank. By providing a reduced rate to energy resources, several states within the region stand to benefit. Revenues generated from the project will provide funding needed for infrastruc-tural development programs in roads and schools, and will support education and health care initiatives for the citizens of Ethiopia. Yet, the states along the Nile River Basin, as well as the international community, do not support the project. Literature Review Establishing the Human Right to Water A number of Covenants, Treatises and Conventions expressly state or provide support and justification for the basic hu-man right to safe drinking water and sani-tation. A rights-based approach to poli- cies and legislation regarding water use should provide accountability, citizen em- powerment and active participation, transparency in national development processes, complete and rational develop-ment frameworks, safeguards against harm, effective and complete analysis, and a more authoritative basis for advo-Introduction The Nile River basin supports the com- munities and citizens of ten riparian states. The major source of the river be-gins at the highlands of Ethiopia, yet the majority of this water is claimed by Egypt through a long-standing agreement that was influenced by colonialism. Egypt cur-rently holds a privileged position with re-spect to water distribution, wealth, mili- tary strength and influence. However, this position grows ever more tenuous as de-velopment efforts, as well as water scar-city, grow. There are a number of ele-ments that influence the present situation in Egypt and Ethiopia. This case study explores different factors influencing this situation, as well as existing agreements and their impact on the right to water and the right to development in each country, assessing the potential for interstate con-flict in the region. Since 1891, Egypt has entered into vari-ous agreements pertaining to water rights with other countries. In 1959, Egypt and Sudan signed The Agreement for the Full Utilization of the Nile Waters , which gave Egypt rights to utilize 85% of the water flowing into the region. Egypt continues to benefit from this position; its eco-nomic position within the region, the strength of its military, as well as its con- trol over the Nile River influences and hinders development efforts made by other riparian states. In 2010, Ethiopia attempted to enter into an agreement to claim their share of rights to the waters of the Nile, however Egypt and other riparian states would not Water Rights and the Potential for Conflict in the Nile River Basin 124 Journal of Global Development and Peace man security is needed first, then eco- nomic security, followed by water and energy security (OHCHR, 2011). The right to water is a straightforward State responsibility; however, it is a complex issue, particularly in light of globalization, where the interests of other states play a role in this conflict. In October 2011, the Human Rights Council adopted the Resolution to the Right to Safe Drinking Water and Sanitation (A/ HRC/RES/18/1) acknowledging a num-ber of past Conventions, Covenants and outcome documents that had adopted these and other issues, affirming: x\u0003\"The need to focus on local and na- tional perspectives in considering the issue, leaving aside questions of inter-national watercourse law and all trans boundary water issues\" x\u0003The resolution calls upon states \"to assess existing policies, programmes and activities in the sectors of water and sanitation, giving due considera-tion to waste-water management, in-cluding treatment and reuse, and to monitor resources allocated to in- crease adequate access, as well as to identify actors and their capac- ity...\" (7 (b)). x\u0003\"To assess whether the existing legis-lative and policy framework is in line with the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, and to repeal, amend or adapt it in order to meet human cacy (Robinson, 2005). The rights-based approach is one way to evaluate the exist-ing agreements governing water rights along the Nile. A number of international agencies have lobbied for the inclusion of the basic right to clean water and sanitation in the framework of human rights. The concept of water as a basic need was established at the UN Water Conference in 1977 (OHCHR, 2010). Since then, a number of International Conferences on the Envi-ronment and Development, on Popula-tion and Development, and regional dec-larations, have affirmed the right to water. The result of these efforts has conse-quently defined the duty of the state in providing safe drinking water. Similarly, obligations to safe drinking water and sanitation were formulated in The Con-vention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (1979, art. 14(2)); the International Labour Or- ganization's Convention No 161 concern-ing Occupational Health Services (1985, art. 5), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989, arts 24 and 27 (3)) and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006, art. 28) (OHCHR, 2010). Most importantly, the Interna-tional Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Human Rights Committee has stated that \"the right placed a duty on States to ensure access to the means of survival and required States to adopt posi- tive measures\" which are reflected in the HDIs (OHCHR, 2010, p. 5). Assurance to clean water, as an economic, social and cultural right, must be provided for by the participating States. The position of the World Water Council maintains that hu-Water Rights and the Potential for Conflict in the Nile River Basin 125 Journal of Global Development and Peace Whether one adopts a Rawlsian position on distributive justice whereby the distri-bution of rights (wealth and income) is beneficial to the most disadvantaged, or a utilitarian approach whereby distribution of rights based on the greatest good for the greatest number of people is the de-terminant for justice, is a philosophical debate. One could argue either way on which population is more disadvantaged. Furthermore, examining the issue of wa- ter rights is more complex given that the debate is over a trans-border waterway. According to Shiva (2002), four theories have guided water rights: x\u0003territorial sovereignty, x\u0003natural water flow, x\u0003equitable apportionment, and x\u0003the community of interest. According to Shiva (2002) the Helsinki Rules on the Uses of the Waters of Interna- tional Rivers adopted in 1966, \"recognized that states are 'entitled to a reasonable and equitable share in the beneficial uses of waters' of an international drainage ba- sin\" (p. 79). The real issue however re- mains: there is no formal agreement on ownership of trans-border waterways. Causes of Resource Conflict A number of theories seek to explain re- sources as a cause or factor in conflict. Collier (2001) finds that there is a correla- tion between political regimes and eco-nomic conditions whereby democracies in richer countries are less prone to vio-lence. Klare (2002) posits that conflict for resources can be one of conquest in terri- tory or access to resources in another rights standards and principles. (art. 7 (d)). In addition to the Resolution (UNHRC, 2011), The UN Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of Interna-tional Water Courses (1997) provides two key guidelines: the rule of equitable and reasonable use, and the no harm rule (A/51/49, art. 1(1) (2); Shiva, 2002). With respect to the agreement established in 1959 between Egypt and the Sudan, the Convention provides that States under existing agreements may \"consider har-monizing such agreements with the basic principles of the present conven- tion\" (A/51/49, art. 3(1)). These affirma- tions support the position of both the ex-isting agreement because of the no-harm rule and the position held by the other riparian states in their claims for equitable use (Shiva, 2002; Klare, 2002). The chal-lenge here is that the Convention is not binding; there are no laws governing what Vandana Shiva (2002) refers to as the \"natural law of the water cycle\" (p. 76). On the one hand, the global community acknowledges the right to water and, on the other, the economic and political en-vironment that leads to the high-stakes dispute over water. The issue of water rights must be viewed first within the framework of the distribu- tion of resources (i.e., state ownership of water and sovereignty), and then in the context of globalization. With respect to the distribution of resources, there are two widely held philosophical positions: that of John Rawls on universality or John Stewart Mills on utilitarianism. Water Rights and the Potential for Conflict in the Nile River Basin 126 Journal of Global Development and Peace x\u0003Weak States Mechanism : Weak state- society linkages and the natural re-source dependent economy. Govern- ment structures do not engage citi- zens; society has less information about governmental activities and there is little accountability. The state is reliant on resources rather than on taxes. x\u0003Sparse Networks Mechanism : Social co- hesion is low due to low levels of in- ternal trade. The economy is frag-mented into independent enclaves of production. The supply and demand for resources within economic, political, and social structures is an element of a number of resource conflict theories. Daniel Peder- sen (2002) suggests that inequalities over access to critical resources contribute to an escalation of armed forces. Economic structures and political opportunities that promote engagement in policies that \"bleed development efforts dry\" are problematic and contribute to resource conflict (Collier, 2001; Ron, 2005, p. 447). These theories, however, do not account for the historical influences of the politi-cal environment as a whole. The political ecology theory provides a historical per-spective of scarcity and abundance within the social construct and political economy of resources; the theory accounts for the exclusion of countries from globalization rather than expansion (Le Billon, 2001). Resource conflict theory is used to evalu-ate the current relationship between Egypt and Ethiopia, and the other ripar- ian states. The relationship between com-country. As supplies of coveted resources dwindle, as world population expands, as prices for goods rise, and as political lead- ers use resources (or the lack thereof) to remain in power, the risk for conflict rises; interest in resources therefore out-weighs ethnic and religious affiliations (Klare, 2002). Water security, economic stability and national security are likewise intertwined. Other theories seek to explain resources as causes of war. Both Collier (2000) and Humphreys (2005) suggest that the com-modities themselves do not cause war, but serve as a mechanism. Humphreys (2005) postulates six mechanisms: x\u0003Greedy Rebels Mechanism : Domestic groups engage in quasi-criminal activ- ity to benefit either the individual or state. Natural resources increase the prize. Rebels may focus in a particular area where resources are concen- trated. The aim is not necessarily to control the resources, but rather to extract rents. x\u0003Greedy Outsiders Mechanism : States and corporations foster conflict. x\u0003Grievances Mechanism : there is a de- pendence on natural resources. Nota-bly, the extraction of resources and forced migration and the unjust distri- bution of wealth attributed to the re- sources. x\u0003Feasibility Mechanism : Financing of re- bels through resources to achieve other goals. Water Rights and the Potential for Conflict in the Nile River Basin 127 Journal of Global Development and Peace Congo, and Eritrea. Conflicts over the river between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan have occurred over the years. In 1903, Ethiopia signed an agreement with Sudan not to manipulate the flow of the Blue Nile. It also establishes the state borders between the two countries. The treaty was made by Great Britain as a colonizer of Sudan. The 1929 Nile Waters Agree-ment gave Egypt the right to veto devel- opment in the upstream territories with- out any restrictions regarding its own de- velopment. Batstone (1959) proposes that international lawyers approved the agree-ment because it separated \"the problem of the Nile waters from the political dis-pute between Egypt and Great Brit-ain\" (p. 531). The signing of the 1929 Agreement highlights how political and economic influences undermine a state's ability to protect the rights of its citizens. At this point in history, Egypt had se- cured the majority of the Nile flow and secured the right to undertake projects without the consent of upper riparian states. Egypt was in a position to engage in hydroelectric development initiatives. Egypt began construction on the Aswan Dam in 1958, displacing over 100,000 Su- danese; with the promise of more water, a bilateral agreement between Egypt and the Sudan was signed (Shiva, 2002). The Full Utilization of the Nile Waters allotted the majority share of the water to Egypt and a small share to Sudan. The agree- ment was reached without input from the modities and resources, and the state, within the global economic environment provides a complete perspective in which to assess the mechanisms. Politics and Globalization The challenges facing the development efforts of Ethiopia can be seen through the lens of globalization. Globalization, first and foremost, expands the number of stakeholders in state development ini- tiatives. Not only does it increase the number of actors, but it also provides the opportunity to advance social agendas (Bhagwati, 2007). The political and eco-nomic matrices of globalization are en-meshed. The policies provide a means for attracting foreign capital and direct in- vestment (Stiglitz, 2002). While freer trade is intended to promote growth through increases in exports and demand in unskilled workers, access to opportuni- ties undermines trade policy efforts for many poor countries. In some instances, particularly in Ethiopia, the policies them-selves present limitations to growth and development (Stiglitz, 2002). With the Grand Millennium Dam project, Ethiopia stands to increase revenue that will sup-port infrastructure; however, the World Bank and other countries and donors do not support its efforts. Case Study Historical Perspective The Nile is the longest river in the world; it is shared by Ethiopia, Sudan, Egypt, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Water Rights and the Potential for Conflict in the Nile River Basin 128 Journal of Global Development and Peace The Right to Water Fact Sheet (2010) pub- lished by the OHCHR, UN Habitat, and the WHO provides an overview and guide on the right to water and interna-tional human rights obligations as defined in a number of Covenants, Treatises and Conventions among participating states. Most notably, hydro-policies must not exclude marginalized groups; the policies put forth seek to \"inform water manage- ment by clearly prioritizing, in the alloca- tion of water among competing users, personal and domestic uses as defined in general comment No. 15. (ICESCR)\" (OHCHR, 2010, p. 16). The rights-based approach is outlined and is consistent with Robinson (2005) whereby non-discrimination, transparency and ac- countability in reporting are noted. Political and Economic Influences Political and economic influences have a direct bearing on resource distribution negotiations. Friedman's theory of global-ization has influenced the emphasis placed on economic relations in interna-tional affairs and the market mechanism approach to resolution (Klare, 2002). However, the manner in which those fac- tors are employed is changing, and with that change, we must promote equitable distribution of resources. The other factor in the approach to reso- lution is the economic influence of third party states. Russia and China have sup- ported past projects undertaken by Egypt, other riparian States, and was made with- out regard to their demands (Shiva, 2002, Klare, 2002). Policies and Precedents At the outset, it is important to establish the precedent that was set by the interna-tional community regarding the right to water and how it relates to the situation in the Nile Basin. The debate over the Egyptian agreement and the right to the Nile reveals an important distinction be-tween property or land rights and treaties. If the matter at hand were regarding land rights, Sudan's independence from Great Britain should have dissolved the treaty between Sudan and Egypt (Batstone, 1959). Because Egypt maintained its level of access to the Nile waters, the distribu-tion of the Nile waters was based on a treaty rather than human rights. If the dis- tribution of the Nile waters had been based on property rights, the inequitable burden put on Sudan would have resulted in the dissolution of the original agree-ment (Batstone, 1959). Given that inequi-ties in the distribution of the Nile remain today, one must consider the impact this precedent has had on the continued fight to recognize the basic human right to wa- ter. For over ten years, the World Water Council has been organizing the World Water Forum to promote \"hydro -policy\" for the protection of human rights, sus- tainability, water security and accessibility. Water Rights and the Potential for Conflict in the Nile River Basin 129 Journal of Global Development and Peace Matters of national security are generally viewed in light of the stability of the state. However, the absence of a vital natural resource such as water would likely in-voke a rebel response if a state were not to uphold its obligation to protect and secure the basic human rights of its peo-ple. There is no doubt of any nation's de-pendence on water; the scarcity of water could potentially serve as a catalyst for war as grievances would incite rebellion (Humphreys, 2005). Other grievances could also cause tensions to rise as a re- sult of displacement due to dam construc-tion. Conflict may arise both between states and within states due to the denial of water rights. It seems plausible in the case of the Nile River Basin that if a state does not take proactive measures to se- cure its people's right to water, the state itself risks civil unrest within its own bor- ders. Civil unrest in this region could engage the support of foreign actors. This would, of course, engage the other mechanisms of conflict that would further complicate relations. Financial support of rebel forces (i.e., the feasibility mechanism) would likely provide stakeholders an op- portunity to expand claims to water. It would seem unlikely that one state within the region would make an appeal militar-ily for water rights. The interdependence of Egypt and Sudan, as well as China's financial backing of past water schemes surely serve as deterrents for the impov-Sudan, and Ethiopia respectively (Klare, 2002, UNDP, 2011). The upstream ripar-ian states have lacked the financial capital to develop extensive waterworks pro-grams, which has placed Egypt in a privi- leged position (Klare, 2002). Resource privilege is a component in reducing pov-erty, which may also contribute to con-flict (Anderson, 2012). Without external support to the other riparian states, Egypt continues to impede Ethiopia's develop- ment efforts by restricting access to the waters of the Nile. National Security and the Risk for Conflict in the Region The distribution of the waters of the Nile has created a condition that could lead to conflict. With the World's growing popu-lation, competition for water and hydroe- lectric resources increases. This scenario could prove to be a hot spot for conflict in the region. At this point, any state en-gaging in new water schemes may pro-voke conflict. Since Sudan has an estab-lished right to water, it could be the target of another state's desire to acquire Su-dan's oil and water resources. Most nota- bly, the rising tensions between Sudan and South Sudan today over oil-rich lands demonstrates the grievance mechanism as a source of conflict (Humphreys, 2005). If there was a war in the region over wa-ter or oil, it is likely to receive the atten- tion of the UN Security Council. Water Rights and the Potential for Conflict in the Nile River Basin 130 Journal of Global Development and Peace 2012; Armstrong, 2012; Klare, 2002; and Shiva, 2002). The approach of human rights advocates can't do enough to pre-serve precious resources for future gen-erations; according to Shiva (2002), an ecological paradigm can link resource al- location to economically sound practices. The Carnegie Commission (1997) calls upon the business community to sensi-tize. For risk-reduction, businesses should work with national authorities to develop practices that permit profitability and contribute to community stability (Carnegie Commission, 1997). Conclusion The international community has a re- sponsibility to ensure equality in the dis-tribution of water rights in order to avert conflict. Standing idly by while access to vital resources are being unjustly distrib- uted is no longer in any state's best inter- est. Globalization, foreign investment, modernization, and advances in the ac-knowledgement of water as a human right have afforded citizens with the informa-tion needed to act upon injustices in the distribution of water rights and other hu- man rights violations. The perpetuation of extreme poverty is the result of poor policy making and indifference to the plight of the poor. Without action, the problem of the fair and equitable distribu-tion of water resources will result in con- flict and further suffering. The time for intergovernmental involvement in the de-erished nations in the region. Foreign in-vestment in the region complicates the matter at hand. Even if there were a mul-tilateral governing body to manage the distribution of waters, it seems unlikely that Egypt would forego its position with- out force. Sustainability and Intergovernmental Agency Solutions The World Bank (2012) projects popula- tion growth of 152% within the region by 2025. The rise in population will drive the demand for resources (Klare, 2002). The scarcity of resources, such as water, food, and energy will become all too burden- some for the inhabitants of the Nile River Basin. At the international level, organiza-tions, corporations and scholars have been united in their support of efforts in educating people and promoting the cause of environmental sustainability. The utilization of a rights-based approach with the assistance of intergovernmental agencies in developing and negotiating agreements and policies that focus on en-vironmental sustainability provides the framework for the equitable distribution of natural resources. There is an overwhelming need for a col- laborative intergovernmental, regional and local approach to resource manage- ment. Calls for a coherent approach for sustainable water-use policies by environ-mentalists and human rights activists have made some progress (WWC, 2011 and Water Rights and the Potential for Conflict in the Nile River Basin 131 Journal of Global Development and Peace velopment of agreements with a focus on sustainability rather than profit is now - before there is an escalation in tensions over a significantly diminished supply of water. Governments, corporations, and citizens have a responsibility to protect the security of water resources. Environ-mental sustainability efforts are a global responsibility.

As the infection rate among adults creeps closer to one in five, the need to address the elements contrib- uting to this increased infection rate is vital. That being said, amidst the effort to deter- mine and minimize risk factors, individuals with disabilities are often excluded. Whether due to social marginalization or issues of accessibility, disabled individuals are less in-volved in the discourse regarding HIV/AIDS in South Africa. These individuals are, as a result, often at a greater risk of contracting the virus. The United Nations Declarations on the Rights of Disabled Individuals, paired with South Africa's disability inclusive Na-tional Strategic Plan, have increased awareness and begun effective campaigns to com-bat this discrepancy. The factors that most often place disabled individuals at risk paral-lel those issues addressed by the Millennium Development Goals. By using this well- known international effort as a guideline for how to approach HIV and disability, South Africa may bolster more support, resources, and other assistance needed to fully realize the rights of disabled individuals and lessen their risk of infection. 135 Journal of Global Development and Peace abled individuals in South Africa, but they have limitations, and their effectiveness is not certain. Disabled individuals often lack the ability to adequately advocate for their needs. For this reason, it is necessary to assess services currently available to disabled individuals and attempt to em-ploy systems of sex education that will provide disabled individuals with the in-formation that they need to protect them-selves from HIV infection in a way that effectively accommodates the different styles of learning necessary to ensure that the information provided is understood and implemented. What is a Disability? According to the World Health Organiza- tion, 1 in 10 individuals, or approximately 600 million people worldwide, are living with a disability that is significant enough to affect their everyday lives. Eighty per- cent of these individuals live in develop- ing countries 3. The definitions of what constitutes a disability are very general; so it is important to recognize that disabili- ties take a variety of different forms, and each require their own approach for ac-commodating them. The World Health Organization's Inter-national Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) provides the framework for quantifying the term dis- ability. It outlines disability as the inter- face between an individual living with an impairment and the circumstance in which he/she lives (including attitude to-wards that circumstance, the environment around them, and the barrier that their attitude, environment, and other personal Introduction Of the 50 million plus people living in South Africa, it is estimated that as many as 5.9 million are living with human im-munodeficiency virus (HIV), about 12% of the entire population. Of those 5.9 mil-lion individuals, as many as 5.5 million are adults between the ages of 15 and 49. This boosts the prevalence of the disease within the adult population to 18%, meaning that nearly one in five adults in the country of South Africa is living with HIV/AIDS 1. South Africa is, as a result, the country with highest rate of HIV in-fection in the world. This places it at the forefront of the discussion regarding how to lessen the impact of the disease, and of efforts to eradicate it. As the general population is placed in the limelight of the HIV/AIDS movement, a small group of South African individuals continues to be neglected. These indi- viduals are living with disabilities. The Human Sciences Research Council in South Africa recently reported in a na- tional survey, an HIV prevalence of 14.1% among individuals with self-reported disabilities as opposed to 10.9% among the general population 2. This number does not accurately reflect the disabled population, as some individuals may not have reported on their disability status. However, this number does reveal that the nature of disability and the social conditions in which it thrives may be placing disabled individuals at a higher risk of infection due to their circum-stances. A few agencies provide services to dis-HIV/AIDS and Disability: Why South Africa needs to realize the Millennium Development Goals 136 Journal of Global Development and Peace create a context for understanding disabil- ity. From this framework, countries can better identify populations that may re- quire different levels of assistance and therefore be more effective in accommo-dating them. Disability in a human rights context The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) 7 set a precedent in the international community for how all hu- man beings were entitled to live. It en-compassed the most basic human necessi-ties: access to food, shelter, security, as well as more societal freedoms such as the right to religious, cultural, and politi-cal opinions. It created a level playing field for all individuals on the planet with no discriminations 8. It was not until December 20, 1971, that the United Nations adopted a set of rights specifically catering to individuals with intellectual disabilities. The Declara-tion of the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons affirms that individuals living with intellectual disabilities have, to the maximum degree of feasibility, the same rights as all other persons. Though this may seem obvious due to the non-discriminatory nature of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the nature of disability, and the lack of education about it may create some confusion re- garding how to best fulfill the rights of intellectually disabled individuals. Al-though the rights affirmed to these indi-viduals, via the Declaration of the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons, are the same as those in the UDHR 23 years ear- lier, it makes clear accommodations for factors may create), thus affecting his or her ability to actively participate in so-ciety 4. In this definition, disability is used as an umbrella term to describe a wider array of issues that include impairments, activity limitations, and participation re-strictions. The word impairment suggests an issue of body function or structure. It can also describe a lack of, or difficulty with, neurological function. Activity limi-tations are those difficulties faced when attempting to complete a certain action or task. Participation restrictions are de-scribed as problems experienced by indi-viduals with regard to their involvement in life situations and community 5. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) 6 affirms that disabilities in- clude individuals with long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impair-ments that create barriers to their full and effective participation in their communi- ties on an equal platform as those around them. It should be noted that intellectual disability falls under what was formerly referred to as mental retardation. This term is being phased out of use when talking about disabilities, though it may still appear in bureau titles or less recent documents on disability. Mental retarda-tion is still used as a medical diagnosis, but is no longer socially acceptable for use when describing the individual. Neither ICF nor UNCRPD claim to de-fine disability, and in so doing, both ac-knowledge that disability is constantly changing. Whether or not they are appro-priately worded to encompass what it means to be disabled, their intention is to HIV/AIDS and Disability: Why South Africa needs to realize the Millennium Development Goals 137 Journal of Global Development and Peace of Persons with Mental Illnesses and the Improvement of Mental Health Care, and the United Nations Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Per- sons with Disabilities 11. But along with the creation of such strategies and the es-tablishment of time periods to focus on disability, came great expectations. These expectations were largely unmet, and real-izing the rights of individuals with dis-abilities has been an ongoing process ever since 12. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities came into effect on May 3, 2008 13 and, after decades of discussion regarding disability in the international community it finally provided a true rights-based conceptuali- zation of disability. This concept stemmed from a social model of what it means to be disabled, meaning that dis-ability is not only the state of the individ- ual, but also the state of that individual's environment 14. The Convention includes fifty Articles, which, more than its prede-cessors, outlines in detail the rights of dis- abled individuals. Article 11 refers to \"situations of risk\": It states that governments, having a respon-sibility to protect their citizens, are under the obligation to take all necessary actions to ensure that their citizens are safe in situations of risk 15. Though the article goes on to cite such examples as armed conflict and natural disasters, it leaves room for interpretation. The South African population may be seen as being at a higher risk of contract- ing a debilitating and often deadly disease. those individuals whose levels of func- tioning are low enough to draw into ques-tion their abilities to make decisions for themselves. For example, it affirms the right of an intellectually disabled person to have a qualified guardian, when neces-sary, to protect his or her interests. It also notes items like the right to employment. Disabilities can create barriers to employ-ment and a lack of knowledge regarding intellectual disability can lead employers to assume that a disabled person cannot work. The Declaration of the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons makes it very clear that intellectually disabled individu-als have the right to engage in meaningful and productive work to the fullest extent of their capabilities 9. Thus, in December of 1975, the General Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons, reiterating the importance of realizing that the rights of disabled individuals are equal to the rights of all others 10. In the following years, the General Assembly proclaimed 1981 to be the International Year for Dis- abled People, with the years between 1983 and 1992 as the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons. The hope of dedicating these years to the discussion of disability was to draw attention to this marginalized population and to bring about effective change in the mechanisms used to serve and protect these people. The 1990s saw the creation of a number of human rights instruments relating to the particular issue of disability. These instruments included the World Pro-gramme of Action Concerning Disabled Persons, the Principles for the protection HIV/AIDS and Disability: Why South Africa needs to realize the Millennium Development Goals 138 Journal of Global Development and Peace have the right to access the same level and quality of health care as provided to other people. The article specifically states that this healthcare id to include sexual and reproductive health 18. This means that no individual should be denied ade-quate healthcare on the basis of his or her disability. Disabled individuals therefore have the right to seek information, testing, and treatment for HIV/AIDS, with the assistance of reasonable accommodation when necessary. They have a right to know and understand the status of their sexual health and, in so much as they have the capacity, to make decisions re-garding their health. Article 28 outlines standards of living and social protection for disabled individuals, including the right to adequate food, shel- ter, clothing, and decent living condi-tions 19. But these rights that cannot be realized when disabled individuals ac- count for a significant percentage of the worlds' poor. Poverty and disability are undeniably connected and Article 28 serves to point out that disabled individu- als have the right to the same standards as the general population may hold for themselves. These Articles in particular have been highlighted to provide background infor-mation specific to the topic at hand re- garding the rights of disabled individuals living with HIV/AIDS. This information will help in understanding how the risk factors that disabled individuals face in contracting HIV/AIDS are often tied to violations of these rights. In terms of what has been done on a na-Disabled individuals, as citizens of South Africa, should therefore have the right to protection from this disease and their government should therefore be commit- ted to providing such protection through this document and those that preceded it. Article 21 of the convention addresses the right of disabled individuals to access information. This ensures that disabled individuals have the right to access infor- mation regarding HIV, disease prevention, and sexual health. These individuals have the right to obtain this information through whatever means suits them. This includes providing reasonable accommo-dation for individuals who require assis-tance in fully understanding that informa-tion. \"Reasonable accommodation\" is de- fined within the United Nations Conven- tion on the Rights of Persons with Dis-abilities as a necessary and appropriate modification made to assist the disabled individuals in understanding, performing an action, etc., that does not impose an unnecessary burden on the person, estab-lishment, or otherwise, that is providing the accommodation 16. Article 24 notes that disabled individuals have a right to education and to receive the supports necessary to obtain that edu-cation within the general education sys-tems of a country. This would include sci- ence, health, and sexual education classes, if these classes were standard for all stu- dents. These students would again, have a right to reasonable accommodation in order to realize their full potential in an educational environment 17. Article 25 states that disabled individuals HIV/AIDS and Disability: Why South Africa needs to realize the Millennium Development Goals 139 Journal of Global Development and Peace individuals are marginalized. In many school systems, individuals with disabili-ties are less likely to be included in sci- ence or health programming and are more likely to be excused from sexual education under the assumption that fewer disabled individuals are sexually ac-tive. Schools, especially in rural areas, are inaccessible for individuals with physical impairments and do not provide assis-tance for individuals who may require them. Children with disabilities are often turned away from schools under the as-sumption that they are incapable of learn-ing or that they would create distractions for other children. This assumption there-fore supports UNICEF statistics that show that one third of all street children are disabled. In addition, literacy rates for disabled individuals are as low as 3%, while disabled women are as low as 1% 23. Often, the issue facing educators is a lack of expertise or resources in communicat- ing with disabled individuals. Regardless of whether or not the child is allowed to remain in school, they may not under-stand the information presented to them due to the barrier created by their disabili- ty 24. This lack of education creates a cul- ture in which disabled individuals do not have the skills necessary to obtain and retain employment, leaving them without a regular source of income and again, placing them at risk for situations of great poverty and reinforcing the cycle dis- cussed above. Along with the lack of general education for disabled individuals is the lack of in-formation and resources available to them to ensure 'safer sex'. There is a common misconception among the general public tional level, South Africa has, since the adoption of the new Constitution, begun to include disabilities in its domestic dis- course regarding HIV/AIDS prevention. The country first included disabled indi-viduals in its National Strategic Plan to combat HIV in the plan that was enacted from 2007 to 2011. In the plan that will be enacted from 2012 to 2016, individuals with disabilities are highlighted as a key population for HIV services. As a part of this plan, South Africa hopes to halve the number of new HIV infections, as well as ensure that at least 80% of infected indi-viduals who are eligible to receive treat-ment are receiving it 20. Being a key popu- lation, people living with disabilities should then hope to see such changes in their infection rates and access to health- care if the conditions of the latest plan are favorable. Disabilities at Risk The risk of contracting HIV/AIDS for disabled individuals is higher for a num-ber of reasons. The first is poverty. A cy- cle exists between poverty and disability, one perpetuates the other and creates a vacuum from which a disabled individual would have great difficulty escaping 21. A 2001 census of South Africa found that only 19% of disabled individuals in the country were employed as compared to the 35% of non-disabled individuals. Pov- erty often prevents disabled individuals from seeking HIV services and treatment due to a lack of money for transporta-tion 22. In addition, a lack of education creates and perpetuates a cycle in which disabled HIV/AIDS and Disability: Why South Africa needs to realize the Millennium Development Goals 140 Journal of Global Development and Peace for a disabled individual to fully utilize them. Such accommodations would in-clude, for example, a sign language inter- preter for deaf individuals to ensure con- fidentiality and eliminate the necessity for the disabled individual to bring a friend or relative with them to their private ap-pointments 29. Some disabled individuals are at a higher risk of sexual violence, which, in turn, ele- vates their risk of contracting HIV. Ac- cording to Moffett 30, one in three women in South Africa will be raped in her life-time, and one in four with be beaten by her domestic partner. These statistics are for the population in general and do not address the additional risk factors facing disabled individuals. Some studies have shown that disabled individuals are up to three times more likely to be the victims of physical and sexual abuse, as well as rape 31. This may be due to disabled indi- viduals' reliance on others for assistance in their everyday lives. Children, for ex-ample, may be isolated within their fami-lies and depend solely on adults for their everyday necessities. Women and girls who are blind or deaf are often more vul-nerable to sexual assault because they are viewed as easy targets. Their inability to identify their rapist because of their dis-ability means that assailants are less likely to face prosecution for their actions 32. Disabled individuals may not have the access to police, legal counsel, or courts for their protection, especially in develop-ing countries or rural areas. They also have less access to medical care following such abusive incidents, including critical psychological counseling, when compared to their non-disabled peers 33. that individuals with disabilities are not sexually active. Studies show that indi-viduals with disabilities are just as likely to be sexually active as their non-disabled peers. Disabled individuals are as likely as their non-disabled peers to engage in sex-ual activity under the influence of sub-stances, which subsequently raises the risk of having unprotected sex, creating higher risk of exposure to HIV. The experience of social stigma may also lead some dis- abled individuals that are seeking social acceptance to engage in unprotected sex in order to feel sexually attractive or lov-ed 25. Despite the fact that most of these individuals reach puberty at approxi-mately the same time as their peers and that rates of homosexuality and bisexual-ity parallel those of the non-disabled population, these individuals are actually less likely to receive messages about HIV 26. Disabled individuals are also less likely to have access to condoms and other prevention methods27. They may be turned away from educational programs or simply not approached to participate. This may be tied to the assumption that disabled individuals are not sexually active or that they do not engage in intravenous drug use 28. Additionally, disabled individuals may have limited access to, or not be able to fully benefit from, HIV and sexual health services. This may be due to lack of knowledge about disabilities on the part of healthcare providers who shy away from approaching such individuals. It may also be due to social stigmas or mis-informed attitudes regarding disabilities. These healthcare facilities may also lack the reasonable accommodations needed HIV/AIDS and Disability: Why South Africa needs to realize the Millennium Development Goals 141 Journal of Global Development and Peace disabled individuals are a high-risk popu- lation for contracting HIV/AIDS in South Africa. In looking for tools to bet- ter serve and protect disabled individuals, one cannot help but notice the similarities between the issues that increase the risk of infection for disabled individuals and those issues which are to be addressed by way of the Millennium Development Goals. Disability and the Millennium Devel- opment Goals The Millennium Development Goals un-derline a commitment set by the United Nations in 2000 to end poverty and hun-ger, provide universal education, realize gender equality, maximize both child and maternal health, combat HIV/AIDS, cre- ate environmental sustainability, and build a global partnership. The achievement of the Millennium Development Goals by the target date of 2015 would allow less developed nations to realize the human rights of their citizens. The Millennium Development Goals and disability are in- herently linked. Poverty is a factor that creates a higher level of risk for contract-ing HIV/AIDS among disabled individu-als in South Africa. The cycle of disability and poverty leaves many disabled indi-viduals without adequate standards of liv-ing. The World Bank estimates that 10% of the worlds' population lives in extreme hunger. Of that population, approxi- mately 20% are living with one or more forms of limitation. Also, the majority of disabled individuals live in developing countries and 82% of these individuals are living below the poverty line 37. Within the disabled population, women are considered to be at an even greater risk than disabled men for contracting HIV due to social hierarchies and stigmas against disabilities. There exist myths that having intercourse with a woman or child who is disabled can cure HIV or AIDS under the assumption that disabled indi-viduals are not sexually active and are \"pure\". These beliefs stem from virgin cleansing myths that have been docu- mented as early as 16th century Europe through the present day in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Europe. Through interviews with disability service providers, connections have been found between incidents of virgin rape of dis-abled individuals and HIV/AIDS. Some service providers, such as the Down Syn- drome Association of South Africa, list it among their most serious concerns for their clients 34. This concept of a virgin cleansing places women and children, particularly young girls, at great risk for infection through sexual violence in ef-forts to find a \"quick fix\" to cure the vi-rus 35. The cultural practice of wife inheritance leaves widowed women at a higher risk as well. A study by the World Bank in 2010 noted that in some cases, women with disabilities are more sexually active in ef-forts to secure normalcy in their commu- nities. Because disabled women often have a lower social status and higher lev- els of unemployment, it becomes impor-tant for them to secure relationships that will provide them with basic necessities for survival in the community 36. These encompass the main reasons why HIV/AIDS and Disability: Why South Africa needs to realize the Millennium Development Goals 142 Journal of Global Development and Peace information and treatment. Also, with the eradication of poverty, disabled individu-als would be more likely to have the money to purchase and install the tools necessary to facilitate their inclusion in society. Disabled individuals would be at a lesser risk of becoming victims of sexual violence due to their isolation. Lessening the risk of sexual violence, in turn, dimin-ishes the risk of exposure to HIV/AIDS. Because disabled individuals are more likely to be denied access to schools, whether by the schools themselves or their families, realizing the goal of achiev-ing universal primary education would also serve to minimize the factors that place disabled individuals in South Africa at such a high risk of contracting HIV/ AIDS. Of the 75 million children be- tween the ages of 7 and 12 who do not receive primary education, approximately 33% have a disability. In developing countries, less than 2% of children with disabilities attend school and less than 5% of those who attend complete their pri-mary education. The majority of these children have moderate disabilities that are not necessarily visible such as learning disabilities, and cognitive, or sensorial limitations. With a lower level of educa-tion, these individuals are less likely to obtain and retain employment by which to support themselves. As a result they are more likely to fall into abject poverty, which creates more at-risk situations for contracting HIV/AIDS 39. The realization of the Millennium Devel-opment Goal of providing universal pri-mary education would, in the case of South Africa, provide disabled individuals Disabled individuals are more prone to poverty. The obstacles that confront them in seeking an education often deter them from finishing school. This happens most often in developing nations that ei-ther cannot or will not provide the rea-sonable accommodation necessary for a disabled child to attend school. A lack of schooling often leads to a lack of market-able skills in the workplace. Disabled indi-viduals with no education would have dif- ficulty securing a permanent position and therefore have no means by which to support their lifestyles financially. Dis-abled individuals may be burdened by the direct costs of medical care, rehabilitation services, aides, and adaptations necessary for them to have access in their own homes. This direct financial burden is coupled with an indirect financial burden. Many developing countries do not have social welfare or healthcare systems prop-erly in place. Such systems would assist in supporting disabled individuals and their families in financing important tools and services to raise the quality of life for the individual. Surrounding this situation of poverty are social stigmas that continually oppress disabled individuals, further less-ening their chances for advancement and independence in a lifestyle that meets an adequate standard of living 38. Therefore, the Millennium Development Goal to eradicate poverty would have a significant effect on disabled populations. In the context of South Africa, where poverty plays a key role in the risk of ex-posure to HIV/AIDS, this could mean a safer environment for disabled individuals. It would allow disabled individuals to seek HIV services, including prevention HIV/AIDS and Disability: Why South Africa needs to realize the Millennium Development Goals 143 Journal of Global Development and Peace This kind of sexual behavior creates a greater risk for HIV transmission. By achieving the Millennium Develop- ment Goal of gender equality, women would be less at risk. The empowerment of women in general would also empower disabled women. These women, having been granted a more equal footing in so-ciety, would not have multiple stigmas attached to them. Indeed, having ad- dressed one of the factors that limits their full participation in society, disabled women will have made a great stride for-ward in asserting themselves. Through this assertion of their rights as women, disabled individuals may feel less need to establish their normalcy within the social structure through sex. Disabled women who are empowered may be less likely to become victims of sexual violence as well. Therefore, the realization of gender equality in South Africa would stand to diminish the risk of HIV infection among disabled women in particular. Minimizing the risk of HIV infection in developing nations sits at the heart of the Millennium Development Goal of com-bating HIV/AIDS. As the global commu-nity works to curtail the impact that HIV/AIDS has on developing nations, it will surely focus on South Africa as a hub of infection. By focusing on South Af- rica's HIV/AIDS pandemic, progress may be made in reducing the infection rates, reducing the impact on at risk populations, and providing treatment to those who need it. Combating HIV/AIDS is critical to the disabled commu-nity, as they have long been at a higher risk for contracting the disease. The fac-with a means to secure their positions in their respective communities. It would make them more aware of their rights as citizens, and perhaps help to bolster their own self-advocacy. By completing pri-mary education, disabled individuals who have the capacity would be able to read and write, allowing them better access to information about their sexual health and HIV transmission. Also, by attending school, these disabled individuals would be exposed to South Africa's \"Life Orien- tation\" program. This program provides, among other things, HIV prevention in-formation, as well as how to access test-ing or treatment if necessary 40. All of these factors would serve to curtail the risk of HIV infection faced by disabled individuals. Women have been identified as a popula-tion that is particularly vulnerable to HIV infection. This is the case with disabled women as well. As a result of this margin- alization, women account for 70% of those individuals living in extreme pov-erty. Only 1% of disabled women in de- veloping countries have the ability to read and write because women are less likely to receive primary education. Having a disability merely increases the chance that a woman will not attend school. Not only that, but the social stigmas attached with disability make it more difficult for dis- abled individuals to find partners and raise families when they choose. There are pervasive beliefs that disabled women are incapable of performing the duties expected of mother and wife 42. As a result, disabled women, in the example of South Africa, may be more likely to engage in sex in order to prove their normalcy 4344. HIV/AIDS and Disability: Why South Africa needs to realize the Millennium Development Goals 144 Journal of Global Development and Peace fort. If, because of this ignorance, the dis- abled community is not being reached as effectively as they could be, then perhaps it is necessary to explore other ap- proaches to providing them with the ser-vices that they need in order to live healthy lives. There are direct and indirect approaches that can be taken towards inclusion. Di-rect approaches towards supporting dis- abled individuals would include the crea- tion of more agencies to serve the dis-abled, particularly in rural communities. These rural communities have been ex-cluded due to their distance from urban centers where most agencies are based. Also, in terms of lessening the risk of HIV infection, South Africa should pro- vide some means for accessing informa-tion that addresses the needs of disabled individuals. For example, written mes- sages to target the deaf, audio messages for the blind, visual diagrams and pictures to assist those with learning disabilities or who cannot read, pamphlets in Braille, use of sign language, and opportunities for educational programs to the general public that provide physical access and reasonable accommodation for those in need. Though these ways of directly in-cluding disabled individuals are known, they are often not well implemented. This may be due to a number of factors. Agen- cies may lack the proper funding. It is possible that agencies may provide some accommodations but not all those that may be necessary, and they thereby may not be able to reach all the individuals that they serve. Also, agencies that are not dealing specifically with disabled individu-tors that contribute to the risk of HIV/ AIDS are often more prevalent in the dis-abled community. It is suggested that dis- abled individuals are up to three times more likely to get infected than the gen-eral population 45. Thus, by combating HIV/AIDS, South Africa would be forced to combat HIV/AIDS among dis-abled individuals residing there. Discussion For disabled individuals, inclusion is a key factor in establishing a quality of life that is concurrent with human dignity. Dis-abled individuals need access to the world around them. Without this access, they are more vulnerable to a number of mala-dies, not least of which is HIV/AIDS. When looking at the risk factors that ex- posed disabled individuals to the virus, it is often clear that the reason for the exis-tence of these factors is their social mar- ginalization. Disabled individuals are sim- ply not treated the same way as the rest of the population. This ostracism occurs de-spite the repeated declaration of their rights both as human beings and as dis- abled individuals. It may be suggested then, that the decla-rations of rights set in place by the United Nations are not enough. The general population fails to recognize the rights of disabled individuals as the same. This may be due to a lack of education surrounding what disability is. For example, a commu-nity with no education regarding disability may not know how to approach a lower functioning individual, or one who is non-verbal. Ignorance about such disabilities creates fear or, at the very least, discom-HIV/AIDS and Disability: Why South Africa needs to realize the Millennium Development Goals 145 Journal of Global Development and Peace societies. Consider, for example, agencies that cater to disabled individuals using the Millen- nium Development Goals to outline the important services that they need to be providing to their consumers. This would create links between local agencies, re-gional groups, and the government as they simultaneously strive to attain the same goals within their respective settings. At the same time, it provides disability organizations with a set of guidelines that can determine how to best serve the com-munity. This would also apply to HIV/AIDS edu-cation programs and health services. If these providers were to focus on address- ing their immediate needs as set forth in the Millennium Development Goals, it might create an atmosphere in which dis-abled individuals were more likely to seek and receive the education and care that they need to protect themselves from HIV/AIDS. Even though the global community is working to meet the Millennium Devel-opment Goals by 2015, the likelihood of that happening is uncertain. This could minimize the legitimacy of efforts to-wards approaching the dilemma of HIV/AIDS risk among disabled individuals. However, because the disabled commu- nity is one that is often marginalized, it is the notoriety of the goals that should be used to bolster support. The mad dash to meet them is more likely to affect imme-diate action. Though discussion regarding the best way to protect disabled individu- als may continue to go on as it has, the als may not reach out to the disabled population when holding educational events. It is for these reasons that an indi- rect approach, linked to another main- stream effort, may be a more effective way to bring about change. This main-stream effort would have goals that affect the disabled community with regard to their risk of infection but would not nec-essarily be disability-centered. Therefore, in terms of an indirect ap- proach, South Africa should consider us-ing the Millennium Development Goals as a tool to assist disabled individuals in their country. The country should realize the strong ties linking these goals and the risk of HIV infection among disabled in-dividuals. The areas that the goals seek to improve are related to the areas that put disabled individuals at the greatest risk of contracting HIV/AIDS in South Africa. By piggybacking off of these goals and supporting their realization, the disabled community would ultimately benefit. The major criticism of such a suggestion would likely be that taking an indirect ap- proach to assisting disabled people is not disability-centered. The fact that the ap-proach itself is not developed specifically to better the situation of disabled indi-viduals could be understood as another effort to undermine the disabled commu- nity. What needs to be emphasized is that this would not be a singular approach. Using the Millennium Development Goals as a way to alleviate the high risk facing disabled individuals would be used in conjunction with already existing poli-cies and plans that address the rights of disabled people to fully participate in their HIV/AIDS and Disability: Why South Africa needs to realize the Millennium Development Goals 146 Journal of Global Development and Peace by the realization of the Millennium De- velopment Goals. Agencies that provide services and supports to disabled indi- viduals and those that provide sexual health services and education could also use the goals as outlines to better ap-proach the critical issues facing the popu-lations they serve. The use of the Millennium Development Goals as a driving force and set of guide- lines for prioritization would provide di- rection for all parties involved in mini-mizing the risk of HIV infection that cur-rently faces disabled individuals. The time frame created to realize the goals, while unlikely to be met, might create a sense of urgency in the coming years. Such an ur-gent push to achieve the goals could af- fect the kind of change necessary to see results in terms of HIV incidence and dis-ability in South Africa. Millennium Development Goals may be- gin to produce results if focused on as an interdependent project between different groups of people in South Africa. Conclusion As the number of individuals infected with HIV/AIDS in South Africa contin-ues to grow, the likelihood of the infec-tion rate going down under the current circumstances is doubtful. This puts South Africa at the forefront for receiving crucial assistance and attention with re-gard to HIV/AIDS. The global commu-nity is aware of the severity of the situa-tion and is poised to help. Many factors place disabled individuals at a higher risk for acquiring HIV. These risk factors that place disabled individuals at high risk for contracting HIV/AIDS clearly resemble the same items addressed in the Millennium Development Goals. As 2015 is quickly approached, more at-tention is being paid to the fact that these goals have not yet been sufficiently ad- dressed. It is this dash to realize the Mil- lennium Development Goals that could create a very positive impact on the risk facing disabled individuals in South Africa. Though this approach would not be very disability-centric, it does have the poten- tial to produce results that actually affect the disabled community in a more imme- diate time frame. Though there are efforts being made to provide disabled individu-als with the services they need, their risk of HIV infection is still greater than the general population due to those risk fac- tors, which would be directly influenced HIV/AIDS and Disability: Why South Africa needs to realize the Millennium Development Goals 147 Journal of Global Development and Peace x\u0003Platform Disability and Development Coorporation (PHOS).

Students in the Global Development and Peace program can focus on one of the three areas of study: 1) Political Economy and Development for students interested in working in less de- veloped countries or in international development agencies and organizations. 2) Culture and Conflict Resolution for students interested in a career in government or a non-governmental organization. 3) Global Management for students with an interest in international business. Students will be expected to demonstrate or to develop a working knowledge of one foreign language during the course of the program. Students will spend a minimum of two months in an overseas internship. The program can be completed in two years. For more info please see the Master's Program fact sheet . Internship Opportunities The Masters of Arts in Global Development and Peace includes a two month over- seas internship for all domestic students.. Non-US may do their internship if their first language is not English. Domestic students are expected to intern in a country where they can practice the foreign language that they have studied. Students will normally work with an international organization, a governmental agency or an inter- national non-governmental organization. Career Opportunities International College graduates have gone on to work for the United Nations, for international agencies, for International Non-Governmental Organizations. Many have also gone on to work in the corporate world in venues such as General Electric, UBS Warburg, Goldman Sachs, BNY-Mellon, Pitney-Bowes. We anticipate students with the Masters of Arts in Global Development will integrate well into Interna- tional organizations, development agencies and into corporations which have a significant overseas presence. 152 "}
