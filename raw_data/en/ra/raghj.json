Dr. Anthony Palombo, D.C. \"We are electrical beings and the chemicals are only the byproducts of those electrical impulses.\" \u2014Tomas Cowan, MD [There are a lot of ongoing controversial conversations around the 5G technology recently installed around the Earth and its impact on just about everything, especially the health and sanity of the inhabitants of the earth. There are some 20,000 radiation satellites orbiting the planet and 5G towers being installed around the globe . . . interestingly, the first and most 5G saturated city was Wuhan, China, just months before the Coronavirus outbreak in that city. So, I think it's time for me to weigh in on the conversation, as it's about energy and vibrations, the field in which I have worked for half-a-century as a holistic healthcare practitioner, albeit now an elder in retirement, though still very much engaged in vibrational healing with remote distance attunement using sacred sound currents as carrier waves for Spirit and intention.](https://liftingtones.com/2021/10/11/the-price-of-fear-and-vaccine-mandates/my-chorale-pic-2/) Not being a diplomat, I will cut right to the chase with what I want to convey in this bog post\u2014not to engender fear but simply to look squarely at the factual energetic state of our world and the current chaotic human experience of life on Earth . . . and hopefully lead to a path forward. That said, I received this intriguing comment on my previous post [\"Where's the Virus?!\"](https://liftingtones.com/2021/10/24/wheres-the-virus/) from a longtime friend and colleague in the field of sound healing, Deborah Statnekov: According to Rudolph Steiner, founder of Anthroposophy, and as described by Dr. Tom Cowan, a virus is an excretion of a cell which has become poisoned. From their perspective, a virus is not the cause of an illness, but merely a symptom. Anthroposophy understands the cause of illness to be a disturbance in the electrical equilibrium of the body which points to the connection between 5G and \"viruses.\" Anthroposophy is defined as \"A formal educational, therapeutic, and creative system established by Rudolf Steiner, seeking to use mainly natural means to optimize physical and mental health and well-being.\" I would define holistic healthcare with nearly the exact wording . . . and include \"energy healing,\" such as sound healing and energy work as put forward by Reiki and spirit-based Attunement practitioners. A more esoteric and useful definition of Anthroposophy useful to the theme of this post is found on Wikipedia: \"A philosophy founded in the early 20th century, by the esoteric Rudolf Steiner that postulates the existence of an objective, intellectually comprehensible spiritual world, accessible to human experience.\" We can substitute the word \"spiritual\" with \"vibrational,\" as clearly demonstrated in the science of Cymatics, with which most of my readers, if not all, are likely familiar. Cymatics is a type of vibrational bioenergetics medicine developed by British osteopath, Peter Guy Manners, who in the 1940s began work with a team of scientists and medical doctors investigating the biosignatures of the human body. I was born 1940 and am quite aware of this technology being central to my life's work as an energy healer. So, a big posthumous \"Thank You!\" to Dr. Manners. Cymatic therapy is a form of sound therapy. Cymatics refers to the effect of sound waves on matter, and cymatic therapy presumes that sound can have similar effects on the body. Sound is capable of rearranging the structure of molecules, and therefore has unlimited potential as a tool for healing. Watch what happens when sound vibration impacts matter to create beautiful patterns of sacred geometry, as this enlightening video demonstrates: \"What you get out is what you put in.\" Disturbing thoughts and feelings, like sound vibration, will create patterns of dis-ease and chaos, as this video demonstrates. ORGANIZED COHERENT WATER Do you feel that way at times, like your brain is being scrambled? Our physical bodies are comprised of some 85% water, which fact makes them extremely impressionable to vibrations of all kinds. The metaphorical \"Pluck a flower and disturb a star\" speaks to the vibrational impact our every motion, the essential basis of vibrations, has on our environment. I would next like to take you on a journey inside your body's aqueous cellular composition as graphically and dramatically portrayed by Dr. Thomas Cowan, MD via this video. It's lengthy, so you can skip forward to 1:10.00 minutes for an amazing explanation of the mRNA spike protein vaccine, and how the tissues of our cellular anatomy are made of \"organized coherent water.\" He's absolutely entertaining and clarifying. When you have the time, the entire 90 minute presentation is most interesting and informative, well worth your time. The topic of his presentation is \"Contagion\" and how it occurs, if you're interested. [The Contagion Myth ](https://www.bitchute.com/video/iL8lUrarkOg0/)with Dr. Tomas Cowan 5G RADIATION Finally, and to the chief message of this post, Dr. Cowan addresses the G5 issue in a most eye-opening presentation of the vibrational terrain of all pandemics. You will be enlightened I promise you. Watch and listen to this ten-minute video, which I will introduce with these words of Rudolf Steiner when he was asked what the Spanish Flu of 1918 was all about. His answer, as paraphrased and augmented by Dr. Cowan, was: Well, viruses are simply the excretions of toxic cells . . . . They happen when the cell is poisoned. They are not the cause of anything. . . . We are electrical beings and the chemicals are only the products of those electrical impulses.\" Here's [Dr. Thomas Cowan](https://youtu.be/MRovg9t7hj4) As a segue to my next post, I will close and leave you to ponder more wisdom from the pen of Rudolf Steiner, which point to a spiritual path through these turbulent times and forward to a new experience of life in God's Creating Universe: In times when there were no electrical currents, when the air was not swarming around with electrical influences (1917), it was easier to be human. For this reason, in order to be at all human, it is necessary to expend much stronger spiritual capacity than was necessary a century ago. My next post will feature \"The Unified Field\" and will initiate a series of exploratory considerations into the vibrational context of our existence and creativity within and as one with The Field of Universal Oneness.\" Stay tuned . . . and thank you for being with me as we explore the possibilities of a New Earth. As always, I welcome your thoughts on these considerations. Until my next post, here's to your health and joy in life. Anthony Palombo, DC tpal70@gmail.com \"Fear is a reaction, courage is a decision.\" \u2014Winston Churchill FEAR IS RAMPANT and ubiquitous in these days of so-called \"pandemic\" bringing about a catastrophic upheaval in all areas of society and commerce, including health. Fear triggers the flight or fight stress response shutting down the immune system's response to pathogenic invasion. It's been said, fear is faith in evil. People are afraid of this virus as well as the mRNA vaxx. They're afraid of loosing their jobs if they don't get vaxxed. They find themselves between a rock and a hard place, because they have faith in what both of these evils can do to disrupt their lives. The price of this fear is mounting by the hour. I received these comments and observations from a friend in Norwalk, CA, Stewart Berger, in response to my last post: Thank you Tony for your thoughtful essay. I'd call my reply \"The Price of Fear.\" That's because the jobs report shows the U.S. economy added about 200,000 jobs last month, when 500,000 were expected, and we still haven't gotten back all the jobs lost early on in the pandemic. Many say this is due to the vaccine mandates and threats to fire workers who won't get vaxxed. Some are quitting or retiring, further pressuring companies, some of which already have a hard time hiring. This is the price of fear of the virus, even though in my personal view the fear is largely unfounded; as you pointed out, the chance the average American has of surviving the virus, if they even get it, is currently about 98%! Johns Hopkins University has that figure too. Yes, sadly, many people have died, including some close to people we know, and many remain at high risk; bless all those who've cared for them. Trillions in Covid relief funds have already been spent, and I think it would be wise to make it as easy as possible for people to work and to strengthen the economy, so as not to add to a national debt that's approaching $29 trillion and is now 108% of GDP. That's being pushed to future generations. And despite the push for vaccinations, even the World Health Organization says Covid may never totally go away. I agree with you about doing everything one can for optimal immune system health, and there are easy solutions. I also think those who want to be vaxxed should (I did), but those who don't want that should be respected fully for their choice. After all, trying to force someone else to do something they don't want to do tears at the fabric of health or integrity in a national sense, and we've even seen this around the world. HEALTH TIP: Quercetin is as effective as Chloroquine (or Hydroxychloroquine) in providing a gateway for zinc to enter the cell and ward off viruses as well as preventing the replication of the coronavirus in the lungs. \"Something wicked this way comes\". . . CENSORSHIP The following story dispels any residual doubt in my mind that the news and social media \u2014 NBC, CBS, ABC, CNN, FOX NEWS, FACEBOOK & MESSENGER, TWITTER and YOUTUBE\u2014are the censoring arms of Big Pharma, the Medical Industrial Complex (CDC, FDA & NIH), and the United States Government. Something very sinister and criminal has erupted in our world, and it's much bigger than this pandemic of a genetically manufactured virus and vaxx. The real virus is the fear being cultivated by the media in the minds and hearts of the people causing so many to act irrationally, against their better judgment, even with hate and violence. Read Jessica's story to the end if you really want to know what's afoot in America and in the world. Fear and vaccine mandate cost Jessica her life. Jessica Berg Wilson, a 37-year-old stay-at-home mother from Washington, was a healthy and vibrant woman who passed away suddenly on Sept. 7. According to [Jessica's obituary](https://obits.oregonlive.com/us/obituaries/oregon/name/jessica-wilson-obituary?pid=200278331), doctors diagnosed her with [vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia](https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2021/04/01/01/42/vaccine-induced-thrombotic-thrombocytopenia-vitt-and-covid-19-vaccines) (VITT). is a rare, and sometimes fatal, blood-clotting condition [triggered](https://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj.n2195) by COVID vaccines. In an exclusive interview with [The Defender](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/), Tom Wilson, Jessica's husband, and [Thomas Ivancie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCzh3vwZMK0), her uncle, said Twitter's fact-checkers \u2014 who have never spoken with their family to verify Jessica's story \u2014 affixed \"misleading\" and \"misinformation\" labels to her [obituary](https://obits.oregonlive.com/us/obituaries/oregon/name/jessica-wilson-obituary?pid=200278331). Because of the Twitter labels, people couldn't interact with Jessica's obituary, or share the story. In late August, Jessica went to a Seattle pharmacy to get her COVID vaccine and was told she would be receiving the [Johnson & Johnson](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/fda-warning-jj-vaccine-serious-rare-autoimmune-disorder/) (J&J) shot. Jessica had no underlying health conditions, her husband said. Jessica was \"vehemently opposed\" to taking the vaccine, \"considering her stay-at-home mom status, state of good health and young age in conjunction with the known and unknown risk of an unproven vaccine,\" Wilson said. But Jessica was pressured to get the vaccine due to a [vaccine mandate](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/biden-vaccine-mandates-politicians-fight-back/) at their child's school requiring \"room moms\" who wished to serve in the classroom be fully vaccinated. According to Ivancie, Jessica became ill after receiving J&J's vaccine, and went to the emergency room at UW Medical Center. Ivancie said Jessica had been vaccinated and was suffering various severe symptoms. But attending doctors insisted on giving Jessica a COVID test and sent her home. They did not pursue any other treatment. Once at home, Jessica lost consciousness and was taken by ambulance to UW Medical Center in Seattle, where doctors diagnosed her with VITT, Ivancie explained. A team of doctors worked to relieve pressure on Jessica's brain, but ultimately, it was too late. As a young mother, Jessica was a dedicated listener to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s \" [RFK, Jr. The Defender](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/rfk-jr-the-defender-podcast/id1552000243)\" podcast. She was well-informed about COVID vaccines and adamantly opposed to getting the injections, Ivancie said. In [Ivancie's eulogy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCzh3vwZMK0) he said: \"Jessica died as a direct result of an [experimental vaccine](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/types-applications/investigational-new-drug-ind-application#Introduction) \u2014 a vaccine that she vehemently opposed taking. Jessica felt coerced. She felt robbed of her ability to choose. Her ability to say 'no' \u2014 to say no to a medical procedure she did not want \u2014 was taken from her.\" Her obituary said: \"During the last weeks of her life, [the world turned dark](https://obits.oregonlive.com/us/obituaries/oregon/name/jessica-wilson-obituary?pid=200278331) with heavy-handed vaccine mandates. Local and state governments were determined to strip away her right to consult her wisdom and enjoy her freedom. \"Her passion to be actively involved in her children's education \u2014 which included being a room mom in her child's classroom \u2014 was, once again, blocked by government mandate.\" Ivancie said Jessica \"was informed she could not enter her daughters' school campus for any reason unless vaccinated, and as a dutiful mother, Jessica wanted to be able to take her children to school and volunteer there as needed. Thus, under duress, she relented and took the vaccine.\" Jessica's husband said he received [Pfizer's vaccine](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/kristi-dobbs-injured-pfizer-covid-vaccine-local-news-agency-kills-story/) \"several months back\" because his work involved traveling and being around a lot of people. \"It was best for our family that I got the vaccine,\" Wilson said. But Jessica was \"in a limited bubble as a stay-at-home mom, was of a young age and was concerned about the unproven nature of these vaccines.\" \"She didn't feel it was needed for her,\" Wilson said. \"But then as the mandates came out, Jessica and those mothers who are very very involved in their children's lives \u2014 she wanted to be involved in every step of their lives. That was her main priority, her kids.\" In a memorial to his wife, Wilson wrote: \"Ultimately, this one-size-fits-all government policy cost Jessica her life, my children their mother, me my forever love and resulted in the loss of a very special person who touched many and was just making her dent felt on this world.\" Wilson told The Defender: \"My view on this whole story is \u2014 I want the world leaders to take notice because Jessica's life is irreplaceable. There was a high value on her life and what she did for our family and for others. She touched a lot of people and there's no replacing Jessica. \"I just hope that those people who are in control, who are setting these mandates at the top, are listening to her story and how we can protect the next Jessica from having to take this vaccine should they not think it's necessary for them.\" Wilson said physicians at the hospital \"100%\" recognized she had a [vaccine adverse event](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/vaers-cdc-deaths-injuries-covid-vaccines/) and told him they reported it to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Yet, no government official has contacted him about the report, he said. Twitter censors Jessica's obituary attributing her death to J&J's vaccine Twitter was slammed on Monday for fact-checking [Jesscia's obituary](https://obits.oregonlive.com/us/obituaries/oregon/name/jessica-wilson-obituary?pid=200278331), which attributed her death to [blood clots](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/woman-johnson-johnson-vaccine-blood-clots-scientists-may-know-cause/) brought on by J&J's vaccine, the [New York Post reported](https://nypost.com/2021/10/04/twitter-criticized-for-fact-checking-seattle-moms-obituary/). The tribute, published by The Oregonian, said the mother of two died from \"COVID-19 vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia.\" It was marked as \"misleading\" by the social media giant over the weekend, according to Twitter users. Twitter fact-checkers put a \"misleading\" label on Jessica's obituary and prevented people from replying to, sharing or liking the tweet. The fact-check warning was removed by Twitter on Monday morning following the backlash. Wilson said he's not on social media, but said he was disgusted when he learned from others that his wife's obituary was being censored by [big tech](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender_category/big-tech/) companies for being \"misleading\" or for containing \"misinformation.\" Ivancie said he also received reports that Ivancie said, \"When you can't have the truth come out, you're thwarting people's ability to make decisions. It is scary how these entities have the power to censor.\" Ivancie said it feels like a second death \u2014 a death of the truth at the hands of these massive powerful entities. \"Imagine if we had a free and open exchange of truth, how this could change the narrative for others,\" Ivancie said.\"We aren't telling people not to get vaccinated,\" Jessica's husband said, \"that's not what we're doing. We want people to understand Jessica's story and her right to choose, and in her mind, she had no choice in the matter with all these mandates.\" \"We're just hoping people in these positions of power setting these mandates will listen to our story,\" he said. But of course they won't listen. If they do it would only be to see how successful and effective their plandemic and \"vaccination\" campaign have been. But this story is not nearly over. Disclosure is already happening. Stay tuned, and be safe. Fear not, but take courage in deciding what's right for you. Anthony Palombo, D.C. tpal70@gmail.com A MUST SEE VIDEO by [Dr. Peter McCullough](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/covid-expert-dr-peter-mccullogh-urges-unbreakable-resistance-to-vaccines-for-kids/?fbclid=IwAR3D04HVOyiD1N3LfE1oVJyCyxNpg8zBdSHkW7_40hjA0NtdbrRjxIoUW4o) of Texas A&M at Baylor in Dallas: \"This 'can't be about COVID at this stage,' It's about 'some type of totalitarian takeover that's occurred all over the world. Something very dark is going on.\" I invite you to visit my [HealingTones.org](http://www.healingtones.org) blog for more profound insight and spiritual perspective. My professional journey in life began when I turned twenty-one and left the seminary to pursue a career in Chiropractic. The year was 1961. I graduated from Chiropractic college in 1963 and immediately moved south with my family and opened my first practice in Crowley, Louisiana, in the Winter of 1963-64. The Healing Field was ripe for a new paradigm of health care and I was eager to deliver it. Little did I know then that my journey through the field of health care was to be a journey of the profession I had joined that was already engaged in a political battle with its nemesis: the medical profession, the Guardian of the Threshold leading to licensure as a separate, distinct and independent profession with a vitalistic philosophy and a drugless healing science and art. I joined in the fight for licensure here in Louisiana, my home state \u2014 as well as the battle for patients' \"Freedom of Choice\" in health care, a separate journey and battle led by a group of passionate Chiropractic patients with whom we shared a common cause and a common nemesis. After several years of legislative efforts \u2014 and court battles to stop the arrest and jailing of chiropractors \u2014 we finally defeated our nemesis in 1974 when Louisiana became the last state in the Union to license Chiropractors. It also became the last state to grant patients the freedom and right to go to the doctor of their choice. The victory was a partial one, however, as licensure was not the ultimate goal of the profession's quest. The ultimate goal, the Elixir of Immortality, was access to health insurance, the Golden Goose, well guarded by the insurance industry: equality under the law with Medicine in the reimbursement for Chiropractic services. Licensure was only a means to this end \u2014 an end that, to this day, Medicine is bent on denying chiropractors by controlling how freely and deeply they are allowed to dip into the Golden Goose's nesteggs. After all, health insurance was a creation of medical doctors as a way of insuring they got paid for their services. So it's their game and they don't want anyone else dipping into their fee-pool. Stiff restrictions and fine-bearing compliance laws have been put in place via HIPPA, making it costly and time-consuming for doctors to file and follow up with reimbursement claims. Documentation has become one of the dreaded aspects of modern day health care, seconded by the escalating cost of malpractice insurance in a litigious society to which healthcare providers dedicate their lives of service. So, the insurance industry has become a nemesis to both professions by determining the amount of the reimbursement for services rendered. All this to say the field of healthcare \u2014 a misnomer in itself \u2014 does not have the same lure of attraction it had when I entered it some fifty-six years ago. Medicine continues to be a nemesis to the Chiropractic profession \u2014 but only as long as chiropractors worship at the altar of the insurance industry and hold financial remuneration as their primary goal, their Elixir of Immortality. There is a trade-off, however, in this pursuit for insurance equality alongside Medicine. That trade-off is the surrender of the very soul of Chiropractic, nourished by its philosophy, which honors the Innate Power of the human body to heal itself naturally and without the toxic and invasive intervention of drugs and surgery. A motto of the chiropractors, once held religiously, was \"Chiropractic first\u2014Medicine second\u2014surgery last.\" Sadly, that trade-off was made by the bulk of the members of our beloved profession, along with all but a few of its colleges, who continue in the sacred philosophical tradition of our Beloved Founder and developer, Drs. D.D. and B.J. Palmer, respectively. A schism has rocked the profession at its very foundation, sending it down the same lost path Osteopathy took, as many chiropractors began to look and act more and more like medical doctors, prescribing diagnostic tests, and in some states even [delivering babies](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/chiropractic-scope-of-practice/), all the while abandoning \"principled chiropractic\" and the holistic model of natural health care to embrace the reductionistic medical model of relieving pain and treating symptoms, settling for acceptance by their medical colleagues as musculoskeletal specialists, an area of expertise in which chiropractors excel. I suppose the saying \"men must do what men must do\"- as well as women \u2014 applies here. Change is what it is, neither good or bad, right or wrong. Chiropractic was born on September 18, 1895, through the heart and hands of a magnetic healer by the name of Daniel D. Palmer in What Cheer, Iowa. That places it at the fountainhead of vibrational healing and what today is being called \"energy medicine.\" Daniel Palmer had a large vision of his new healing art becoming more an energetic than a physical remedy for all of mankind's diseases \u2014 or dis-eases, as his son, BJ, spelled it in order to describe illness as a lack of ease. This vision became the Palmers' quest, their Elixir of Immortality. Their belief in the innate healing power of the body, along with the discovery of the spinal adjustment, led them to the central principle of natural healing: Remove the interference to the unfettered flow and expression of life energy and let the body heal itself. They took the \"whole man\" into consideration to determine the cause of dis-ease, along with the solution. That cause was seen as being \"quantitative\" as well as \"qualitative\"- physical, mental, emotional, or spiritual \u2014 or a combination thereof. In other words, they looked for the cause of dis-ease in higher levels than just the physical and chemical. They sought the cause of the cause of dis-ease. The obvious solution and cure, then, was to correct or remove the cause, the interference, and the manifest symptoms would simply no longer be necessary to signal a need for change \u2014 change in lifestyle and/or mental and emotional stress and attitude. The symptoms would then simply abate naturally. This was and is the essence of the Holistic model of healthcare, an entirely new and different model from the medical reductionistic model of disease management \u2014 both being essential in the healthcare arena; the ideal being for both to work together for the benefit of the patients they serve. As health care itself evolved, our professional journey merged into a collective and global journey of the Human Species in search for the Elixir of Immortality in the field of health-and-wellness care. Building and maintaining a healthy physique has become the focus of health-and-wellness centers throughout the land. \"Functional Medicine\" is the latest buzz word among chiropractors who are exploring the benefits of nutrition in restoring function to failing organs, tissues and glands. \"Clinical Nutrition\" has come into the holistic model here in the West, as the cause of more and more diseases was found to be related to poor dietary habits and an \"Empty Harvest,\" as Dr. Bernard Jensen describes our commercially grown fruits and vegetables in his book by the same name. Depleted soil can only render foods deficient in vital nutrients, resulting in missing cogs in the nutrient chain, thereby creating an interference to the flow of vital life force in and through the body. This is a modality that I have found to be indispensable in my practice. Acupuncture and several other techniques, such as BioEnergetic Synchronization (BEST), have also emerged as energy-based healing methodologies to take their places in Western Holistic Medicine. Eastern healing traditions have long been harbingers of holistic healing and many of their traditions have found their way into our healthcare systems. Practices such as meditation and yoga have become popular, and gyms are popping up everywhere. This revolution in health-and-wellness care has drawn the attention of the Guardian of the Threshold, the FDA and the AMA, as chiropractic boards began expanding their scope of practice to include procedures that heretofore have been the exclusive domain of Medicine. With the emergence of Applied Clinical Nutrition, Contact Reflex Analysis (muscle testing) and Functional Endocrinology, such conditions as diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and even autoimmune disease are being treated and reversed by chiropractors and other alternative practitioners, much to the objection of medical licensing boards. Law suits have been filed and fines levied. This is not stopping the evolution of health care, however. People have awakened and started to assume responsibility for their health, a responsibility that had been placed with trust in the willing and able hands of Modern Medicine \u2014 which unfortunately has cornered the market on the treatment of disease, especially of Diabetes, Coronary Heart Disease, Cancer, and other autoimmune diseases. \"Alternative healthcare\" made its debut in the last half of the twentieth century carrying the torch of holistic healing into the New Age of Aquarius. Holistic practitioners began popping up throughout the healing field. The words Attunement and Sound Healing entered our vocabulary as energy healing modalities. I was introduce to a model of Attunement in the late nineteen-sixties that works with the energy fields around the endocrine glands, as well as with the Chakra energy centers of the Eastern tradition and Reiki. I later incorporated Sound Healing into my attunement service. The consciousness of humanity has begun to shift to a higher frequency of awareness that has awakened a realization that we are spiritual beings having a human experience rather than physical beings having a spiritual experience. This realization was actually dawning as early as the turn of the twentieth century when BJ Palmer published The Bigness of the Fellow Within in which he tells stories about the \"Giant and the pigmy\"- the inner spiritual Self and the outer mental self, or the \"Innate Intelligence\" and the \"educated intelligence.\" This realization lit up his mind and put a fire in his heart that burned passionately for several decades and was carried forward by those who came to the light of his shining and became inspired to bring forth a new paradigm of vibrational healing. As the fire began to cool in their hearts and the light began to dim in their minds, the torch was set aside in lieu or a \"more scientific\" approach to Chiropractic. Now the torch has been given to others to carry forward, along with a new paradigm of health care which honors once again the innate healing powers of the body. We've come full cycle back, or forward, to our humble beginnings as magnetic healers, only now calling ourselves \"Holistic Healers\" and \"Energy Workers.\" A few colleges still teach principled chiropractic and a small but passionate number of chiropractors still carry the flame in their hearts and in their clinics. The Torch has not been entirely dropped. Alternative health care has now become Medicine's nemesis as more and more doctors are returning to school and abandoning the reductionistic model in lieu of the holistic model of true health care. Physicians of all disciplines are attending seminars to educate and certify themselves in clinical nutrition, herbal medicine and other modalities emerging with the holistic paradigm. It's what the people want and are asking for, and the people have the final say in such personal matters as their health. And the irony of it all is that health insurance doesn't generally cover alternative health care, a forty-plus-billion-dollar industry. The wave has been set in motion and it will dissolve the monopolistic stronghold Medicine has assumed over health care. It will ultimately be defeated by its nemesis and be forced to vacate its self-appointed role as the Guardian of the Threshold to the health care arena. Licensing boards will not be able to stem the tide of this revolution as doctors and non-medical practitioners in the field of healthcare dare to take on the reversal and cure of diseases only Medicine has held the legal right to treat symptomatically. It's a new day . . . thank God! And I am glad to have lived long enough to see it and be a part of its dawning. God bless our doctors, especially our surgeons, whose hearts are in the right place of compassion for the sick and suffering and have only a prescription pad and a scalpel between them and their patients.

When the garlic is crushed, alliin becomes allicin. Research shows that allicin helps lower cholesterol and blood pressure and also helps prevents blood clots. Garlic can also reduce the risk of developing [atherosclerosis ](http://wisemindhealthybody.com/green-med-info/unclog-your-arteries-naturally/)(hardening of the arteries). Compounds in this familiar bulb kill many organisms, including bacteria and viruses that cause earaches, flu and colds. Research indicates that garlic is also effective against digestive ailments and diarrhea. What's more, further studies suggest that this common and familiar herb may help prevent the onset of cancers. 'This chemical has been known for a long time for its [anti-bacterial ](http://eatlocalgrown.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=15160:coconut-oil-everywhere-for-everything&catid=35:articles&Itemid=148)and anti-fungal powers,' says Helen Bond, a Derbyshire-based consultant dietitian and spokeswoman for the British Dietetic Association. I've got chills...and they're multiplying (Common cold with chills and clear runny nose. No fever). Boost your qi, build your blood and kick that cold to the curb broth. This broth/soup can be stored in the fridge easily for a few days. You can also eat the ginger pieces if you like for some extra heat. Feel free to add some other vegetables if you desire to make it more of a meal. But be careful not to add too much salt as salt tends to bring things deeper into the body and this is more about pushing out the cold virus. Bone broth is incredibly easy to make and just takes a bit of time, but not a lot of energy. If you have a slow cooker that's great or I would just let my broth simmer on the lowest setting possible on my stove overnight to get the same effect. Here's to your health!

[This article reveals new data that indicates our vegetables and fruits, herbs and grasses, are increasingly becoming more and more nutrient deficient due to increased CO2 levels in our planet's atmosphere. This re-emphasizes the dire need for wholefood supplementation in our diet. It is becoming increasingly necessary, if we wish to live long and healthy lives, that we take daily dosages of wholefood nutrients, such as those grown and produced by](https://liftingtones.com/2014/08/18/depression-part-4-addiction-and-suicide/my-chorale-pic/) [ Standard Process](https://www.standardprocess.com/) Labs at their huge organic farm up in Palmyra, Wisconsin. Take a few minutes to enjoy the award-winning documentary vimeo at this site and learn more about the production of wholefood supplements. Now for the breaking news story about . . . [http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/09/13/food-nutrients-carbon-dioxide-000511](http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/09/13/food-nutrients-carbon-dioxide-000511) Here's the conclusion of the article: In 2014, Myers and a team of other scientists published a large, data-rich [study]in the journal Nature that looked at key crops grown at several sites in Japan, Australia and the United States that also found rising CO2 led to a drop in protein, iron and zinc. It was the first time the issue had attracted any real media attention. \"The public health implications of global climate change are difficult to predict, and we expect many surprises,\" the researchers wrote. \"The finding that raising atmospheric CO2 lowers the nutritional value of C3 crops is one such surprise that we can now better predict and prepare for.\" The same yearin fact, on the same dayLoladze, then teaching math at the The Catholic University of Daegu in South Korea, published his own [paper], the result of more than 15 years of gathering data on the same subject. It was the largest study in the world on rising CO2 and its impact on plant nutrients. Loladze likes to describe plant science as \"\"noisy\"research-speak for cluttered with complicating data, through which it can be difficult to detect the signal you're looking for. His new data set was finally big enough to see the signal through the noise, to detect the \"hidden shift,\" as he put it. What he found is that his 2002 theory\u2014or, rather, the strong suspicion he had articulated back then\u2014appeared to be borne out. Across nearly 130 varieties of plants and more than 15,000 samples collected from experiments over the past three decades, the overall concentration of minerals like calcium, magnesium, potassium, zinc and iron had dropped by 8 percent on average. The ratio of carbohydrates to minerals was going up. The plants, like the algae, were becoming junk food. What that means for humanswhose main food intake is plantsis only just starting to be investigated. Researchers who dive into it will have to surmount obstacles like its low profile and slow pace, and a political environment where the word \"climate\" is enough to derail a funding conversation. It will also require entirely new bridges to be built in the world of sciencea problem that Loladze himself wryly acknowledges in his own research. When his paper was finally published in 2014, Loladze listed his grant rejections in the acknowledgements. I think you will agree that this study is crucial to the health of humanity.

We all need to hear this message and make fundamental, and in some cases radical, changes in the way we grow, process and consume our food. It also points out the absolute necessity for whole-food supplementation of vitamins and especially minerals. The soil that our food is grown in has been depleted of minerals since the 1940's. Without minerals, vitamins can't be utilized, leading to malnutrition; glandular (iodine for the thyroid) function fails leading to all sorts of health issues, obesity included. The bottom line is SUPPLEMENT your diet with whole food nutritional supplements. I use Standard Process Labs and Medi-Herb in my practice, the very best in supplementation and botanicals.

The results of this study were published in the European Journal of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, and could be of utmost importance at a time when many of the antibiotics are resistant against bacteria, especially against \"superbugs.\" We are talking about the manuka honey, also known as jelly bush honey, which is produced in New Zealand. It has become all the rage over the past few years which led to shortages and selling of fake products. Therefore, New Zealand manuka producers demanded trademark protection, similar to Scottish whiskey or French champagne. After this, the fact that the health benefits of this honey were kept as a secret doesn't come as a surprise. Manuka honey is created by bees foraging on the nectar of Leptospermum Scoparium, the New Zealand manuka bush, as well as tea trees native only to Australia and New Zealand. According to a report by The Australian, manuka honey killed every bacteria or pathogen it was tested on in the studies mentioned above. It can be either taken internally or applied topically to help fight infections on the skin, insect bites, and cuts. The best part regarding manuka honey is that none of the superbugs it killed were able to build up immunity, which is a common problem with most of today`s antibiotics. \"New antibiotics tend to have short shelf lives, as the bacteria they attack quickly become resistant,\" said Dr. Dee Carter of the University of Sydney's School of Molecular and Microbial Biosciences. \"Many large pharmaceutical companies have abandoned antibiotic production because of the difficulty of recovering costs. Developing effective alternatives could, therefore, save many lives.\" Dr. Certer stated that what makes manuka honey effective at destroying the bacteria is a compound called methylglyoxal, which combines other unknown compounds to cause \"multi-system failure.\" Manuka honey is available in health stores and online, even though the supply levels have decreased which led to fake honey being sold. Therefore, when buying manuka honey, make sure you get one that is UMF certified. UMF stands for Unique Manuka Factor, which is a phytochemical property obtained from the manuka bushes. Many certified manuka products are available on Amazon.com. On Amazon, you can find a brand called Comvita manuka honey which is UMF certified and has been said to help erase MRSA : I had done a fair amount of research when a friend of ours got MRSA, and then, unfortunately, I got it too., said user JoshuaOne9 on Amazon. Thankfully, I had already done the research so I knew exactly what to do. As soon as I saw the red bump (thinking the first day that it was a mosquito bite) I scratched it, but the second day I realized that it had to be something else. My husband immediately knew what it was since we had been dealing with our friend's case of MRSA. I got my hands on this Manuka honey and put on the area of skin that was affected and then it is very important that you cover it with a bandaid. Within hours, I felt relief and within a few days, it was completely gone... Even though further research need to be done, we can definitely say that manuka honey promises a lot when it comes to defeating one of the biggest health issues faced by humanity.

These numbers are set to nearly double by the year 2050, based on statistics collected by the National Cancer Institute (NCI).It's no exaggeration to call these numbers epidemic, on par with the 14th century bubonic plague (aka \"Black Death\"), which killed over 30% of Europe's population.My family has been ravaged by cancer. I'll bet yours has, too. Are we supposed to believe that this hyper-acceleration of cancer rates is genetic? With all of Monsanto's biochemical wizardry, one would think that they could find another way to create pesticides besides dumping estrogen-mimicking carcinogens onto the world's food supply. In this video, Dr. Terry Grossman and Dr. Nick Delgado, discuss the relationship between cancer and these unnatural estrogens in our environment. Decades of peer-reviewed research that has shown that harmful [estrogen-mimicking] [chemicals]are invading our bodies through pesticides, plastics (PCBs) and petrochemicals, among other vectors. Exposure to these \"xenoestrogens\" has been linked not just to cancers of reproductive organs but also of the breast, lung, kidney, pancreas, and brain. Additionally, new research shows that all meats, even from animals raised without added hormones, free-range, organic, etc. are naturally very hormonal, such that today, most of us have accumulated up to 10,000 times as much estrogen in our bodies as our ancestors ever did. The less severe consequences of exposure to these estrogen-mimicking envirotoxins (i.e., the preludes to cancer) can manifest as symptoms relating to both high and low estrogen, either of which can cause a range of problems for men and women. A build-up of xenoestrogens can lead to gynecomastia in men (\"man boobs\"), as well as excessive accumulation of DHT (Dihydrotestosterone), a etabolite of testosterone, which binds to receptors in hair follicles and is the primary factor in male pattern baldness (which similarly affects some women). A little-known factoid is that men in their 60s and older often have higher estrogen levels than women of the same age group. Exposure to these estrogen-mimicking envirotoxins can manifest as symptoms relating to both high and low estrogen. In women, excessive estrogen can lead to weight gain, migraines, depression, insomnia and a slew of other symptoms of hormone imbalance. Low estrogen in women can result in elevated blood pressure, heart disease and lack of libido, along with many other problems.What can we do about this? Dr. Grossman and Dr. Delgado agree that detoxification through sweat and our other excretions is important - as is the avoidance of ingesting of these chemicals in the first place. This implies limiting or entirely cutting out our consumption of water in plastic bottles, meats, and other foods that can become laced with PBCs, especially when heated in plastic containers in a microwave oven. Even with a strict vegan diet, the ubiquity of pesticides and other petrochemicals, which we are also inhaling from the air makes it impossible to avoid xenoestrogens completely.Dr. Grossman recommends a diet rich in [cruciferous vegetables]from the Brassica family, such as cabbage, Brussels sprouts, kale, collard greens, mustard greens, cauliflower, water cress, arugala, bok choy and broccoli, among others. These contain compounds which have been found to inhibit the development of cancer and its recurrence. The best results from eating cruciferous vegetables require consuming 2 pounds (1 kilo) per day, which would be a challenge for anyone, so he also recommends the use of supplements containing the two key natural compounds found in this family of vegetables, [DIM (Diindolylmethane)]and [Indole-3-carbinol], which alter the toxic forms of estrogen into their less toxic and beneficial forms. Thanks to Standard Process Labs, we have an excellent product called \"Cruciferous Complete\" made up of kale (whole plant) powder and Brussels sprouts (whole plant) powder, both of which are loaded with these cancer-preventing compounds.
