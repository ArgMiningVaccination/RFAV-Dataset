That is right, one of the most renowned for advocating alternative medicine. Deepak Chopra has become such a figure of a New Age movement, and a spiritual adviser to celebrities like Michael Jackson. Who is Deepak Chopra? Chopra is an Indian-American medical doctor, holistic health & New Age guru, writer and alternative medicine practitioner. Doctor Chopra was born in New Delhi and studied medicine in India before he moved to the States in 1970. He was an endocrinologist in Massachusetts in his early years in the US and eventually shifted his career to the West Coast and the Transcendental Meditation movement where he became a spiritual advisor. His success in this area made him confident that he began writing books and became that popular - especially after appearing with Oprah Winfrey on TV - that he then translated his knowledge and experience from books to seminars.
