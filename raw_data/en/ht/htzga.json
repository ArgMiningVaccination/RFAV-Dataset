Founded in 2017, the Nature-based Solutions Initiative is an international and [interdisciplinary team](https://www.naturebasedsolutionsinitiative.org/team//team/?_sfm_team_type=Core Team) of natural and social scientists, seeking to apply impactful research to shape policy and practice on nature-based solutions through research, teaching and engagement with policymakers and practitioners. We are based in the Department of Biology but we collaborate with economists, engineers, governance and finance experts from across the University of Oxford and beyond. We also work in partnership with international and local NGOs from the conservation and development sectors, businesses and governments. What are Nature-based Solutions? What are NbS? Nature-based solutions (NbS) involve working with nature to address societal challenges, providing benefits for both human well-being and biodiversity. Specifically they are actions that involve the protection, restoration or management of natural and semi-natural ecosystems; the sustainable management of aquatic systems and working lands such as croplands or timberlands; or the creation of novel ecosystems in and around cities. They are actions that are underpinned by biodiversity and are designed and implemented with the full engagement and consent of local communities and Indigenous Peoples. Want to learn more? If you would like to learn more about the role of NbS in climate change adaptation and mitigation, please read some of our recent publications. We also recommend you read about the [IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions.](https://www.iucn.org/theme/nature-based-solutions/resources/iucn-global-standard-nbs) Please also [watch our new animation on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-unUVfAwsQ) NbS Guidelines Make sure you [read these evidence-based guidelines](https://nbsguidelines.info/) around what constitutes successful, sustainable NbS. [NbS Guidelines](https://nbsguidelines.info/) Examples of Nature-based Solutions Restoring and protecting forests and wetlands in catchments Protecting or restoring forests and wetlands (e.g. peatlands) in catchments can secure and regulate water supplies, support production of forest products, and protect communities and infrastructure from floods, soil erosion and landslides. Bringing nature into cities Creating green roofs and walls and planting trees in cities can moderate the impacts of heatwaves, capture storm water and abate pollution. Such measures also have positive outcomes for mental and physical health. Coastal habitat restoration Protecting or restoring coastal ecosystems (mangroves, reefs and salt marshes) protects communities and infrastructure from storm surges and erosion. Coastal habitats, especially mangroves, are particularly good at sequestering carbon, so restoration also contributes to climate change mitigation. "}
