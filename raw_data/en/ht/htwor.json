To get a booster: - you must have had at least your first 2 COVID-19 vaccinations - it's recommended you wait at least 6 months since your last COVID-19 vaccine - it's recommended you wait at least 6 months if you have had a COVID-19 infection.

To get a booster: - you must have had at least your first 2 COVID-19 vaccinations, and - it's recommended you wait at least 6 months since your last COVID-19 vaccine or infection.

How to check when your last vaccine was You can check when your last vaccination was by logging into My Covid Record. Which vaccine is used for boosters For boosters, the bivalent Pfizer vaccine is preferred. This is an updated vaccine targeting Omicron. If you do not want to have the bivalent vaccine, you can ask for the original Pfizer vaccine when you arrive for your vaccination. Adults aged 18 and over can also choose Novavax. This is available at limited sites. [Vaccination sites that offer Novavax ](https://bookmyvaccine.health.nz/map)(Select 'COVID-19' under vaccine type, and then 'Novavax') About the Pfizer BA.4/5 bivalent vaccine The bivalent vaccine makes the immune system create antibodies against both the original variant of SARS-CoV-2 and Omicron subvariants to provide better protection. The bivalent vaccine is recommended for eligible pregnant people at any stage of pregnancy or during breastfeeding. Book a booster You can book an appointment for a booster dose: - online through [Book My Vaccine](https://bookmyvaccine.covid19.health.nz/), or - by calling the COVID Vaccination Healthline on [0800 28 29 26](tel:0800 28 29 26)(8am to 8pm, 7 days a week). Side effects of boosters You may experience some side effects, similar to those you might've had after the first or second dose, such as muscle aches, pain at the injection site, or headaches. For most people, these are mild effects. They are a sign your body's immune system is learning to fight the virus. They don't last long and for many people do not impact day-to-day activities.
