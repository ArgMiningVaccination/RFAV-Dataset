Program Funding Opportunity Description 1. Purpose This notice announces the opportunity to apply for FY 2023 Early Childhood Development (ECD) funding. ECD funding will improve developmental outcomes among children served by health centers. Health centers will accomplish this by increasing developmental screenings1 and access to appropriate follow -up services for children ages 0- 5, and by expanding, enhancing, and further integrating ECD expertise into care teams . For more details, see Program Requirements and Expectations . 2. Background The Health Center Program is authorized by the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) \u00a7 330 (42 USC \u00a7 254b) . For the purpose of this NOFO, health centers are defined as those receiving Health Center Program operational funding under sections 330(e), (g), (h) and/or (i), otherwise referred to as H80 funding. Children ages 0- 5 undergo rapid physical, cognitive, linguistic, and social -emotional growth and development.2 Assessing children's development through developmental monitoring, screening, and evaluation can identify issues early.3,4 Early identification supports timely treatment or intervention, thereby preventing additional delays and contributing to positive health outcomes.5 Early identification of developmental progress is critical because 1 in 6 children has one or more developmental or behavioral disabilities, such as autism, a learning disorder, or an attention- deficit/hyperactivity 1 Comprehensive developmental screening refers to screenings for general developmental milestones; early social -emotional and relational health; autism; and social determinants of health and other family, caregiver, and/or community risks and needs, as well as strengths and protective factors. See Hagan, J. F., Shaw , J. S., & Duncan, P. M. (Eds.). (2017). Bright futures: Guidelines for health supervision of infants, children, and adolescents (4th ed.). American Academy of Pediatrics; AAP COUNCIL ON COMMUNITY PEDIATRICS. Poverty and Child Health in the United States. Pediatrics. 2016; 137(4):e20160339 2 Malik F, Marwaha R. Developmental Stages of Social Emotional Development In Children. [Updated 2022 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534819/ 3 Developmental monitoring involves a provider or caregiver observing children as they grow and change over time to assess if children are meeting developmental milestones. Developmental screening involves the administration of a brief standardized tool to identify children at risk for a developmental disorder, and can be performed by a variety of professionals in health care, early childhood education, community, or school settings. If screening identifies an area of concern, trained specialists conduct a developmental evaluation to determine if a child needs special treatments, early intervention services, or both.

In 2021 , health centers served over 2.8 million children ages 0- 5, representing a key entry point for accessing developmental screening and needed follow -up services. In addition to improving access to recommended developmental screenings and needed follow- up services, ECD funding will support health centers to add child development expertise into pediatric practice teams and enhanc e developmental services , result ing in more effective, timely, and efficient care, and more satisfied families.7 II. Award Information 1. Type of Application and Award Type(s) of applications sought: New HRSA will provide f unding in the form of a grant. 2. Summary of Funding HRSA estimates approximately $30 million to be available annually to fund 150 recipients . You may apply for a ceiling amount of $200,000 ( reflecting both direct and indirect costs) per year. The period of performance is September 1 , 2023, through August 31 , 2025 (2 years ). You will apply for 2 years of funding. Funding beyond the first year is subject to the availability of appropriated funds for the Health Center Program in subsequent fiscal years, satisfactory recipient performance, and a decision that continued funding is in the best interest of the Federal G overnment. HRSA may adjust the final award amounts based on the number of fundable applications and final FY 2023 appropriations. If funded, HRSA will award ECD funding as a new grant award, separate from your H80 award. Under 45 CFR \u00a7 75.302 , you must document use of ECD funds separately and distinctly from other Health Center Program funds and other federal award funds. If funded, you must maintain your H80 award status throughout the 2- year period of performance to maintain your ECD funding. While ECD funding will be issued as a new award, the award will be made in the same subsection proportions of Section 330 as your H80 award, and all uses of ECD funds must align with your H80 scope of project. Your scope of project includes the approved service sites, services, providers, service area, and target population, which are supported (wholly or in part) under your total approved H80 budget.

See Section 5.1 viii of HRSA's SF -424 Two-Tier Application Guide for additional information on all certifications . Program Requirements and Expectations Program Requirements You must propose to use ECD funds to achieve two objectives: 1. Increase the number of children ages 0- 5 who receive recommended developmental screenings.11 2. Increase the number of children and their families assisted12 with accessing appropriate follow -up services within 30 days of a developmental screening identifying an area of concern.13 You must ensure that your health center has the ECD expertise necessary to support screening and assistance with accessing needed follow -up services, either through enhancing existing ECD expertise or through hiring or contracting with new personnel into your care teams . You will advance progress on the ECD objective s by implementing activities within four focus areas: 1. Workforce recruitment, retention, development, and engagement ; 2. Patient/caregiver experience; 3. Access and affordability ; and 4. Population health and health- related social needs. Program Expectations HRSA expects that you will leverage ECD funds to address issues of health equity14 associated with developmental screening and related services . Consider your team's cultural and clinical competence, and the barriers to families with children 0-5 seeking developmental screening and related services . Barriers may includ e trauma, stigma, and social risk factors such as food insecurity, housing 11 This objective will be measured through UDS , in alignment with CDC guidelines. See PAL 2022- 03 for information about the proposed 2023 UDS measure. 12 Assistance means facilitating connection to appropriate follow -up services (e.g., developmental evaluation, therapies) within 30 days of a developmental screening identifying an area of concern. For example, a case manager could facilitate connection to a specialist for a formal evaluation. 13 This objective will be measured through reporting outside of UDS. See the Reporting section for more information. 14 See the HRSA Office of Health Equity and National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services (CLAS) in Health and Health Care f or additional information. HRSA -23-028 7 insecurity, financial strain, lack of transportation/access to public transportation;15 and other health- related social needs that may affect access to care, contribute to poor health outcomes, and exacerbate health disparities.16 HRSA encourages you to use evidence- based practices in your provision of ECD services.17 When developing your proposal, you should reference the ECD Care Continuum in Appendix B and the resources in Appendix C . Your proposal should improve access to developmental evaluations and appropriate follow -up services for children whose developmental screening test identifies an area of concern. Additionally, you should incorporate the caregiver's role in children's developmental monitoring to increase family engagement in tracking children's development. When developing your proposal, you should engage health center patients who have accessed ECD services to identify barriers and successes to inform the proposed project. HRSA recommends that you identify an ECD champion18 to advise and support the organization's approach to expand, enhance, and further integrate ECD expertise into care teams , which may include hiring or contracting new personnel and/or training existing personnel . Personnel with the following training or credentials may be well - positioned to provide ECD expertise: psychologists, social workers, infant and early childhood mental health professionals and consultants, public health nurses, nurse practitioners, infant and early childhood home visitors, physicians and allied health professionals, community health workers, doulas, promotores, care coordinators, parent/peer educators, and early intervention and early learning professionals. Such experts should be supported by provider champions and other trained management and administrative staff to achieve effective practice transformation . HRSA encourages you to apply a two -generation approach that addresses health and health- related social needs for both children and their primary caregiver . 19 Your proposal should include how you will address primary caregiver issues such as financial strain, behavioral health needs , housing stress, food insecurity, and intimate partner 15 See the 2022 UDS Manual for additional information. 16 The PRAPARE Assessment Tool may support your health center with collecting data needed to understand and act on patients' health- related social needs. For additional information, see https://ww w.nachc.org/research- and-data/prapare/ . 17 \"Evidence- based\" refers to resources that are published intervention evaluations or studies that have evidence in effectiveness, feasibility, reach, sustainability, and transferability. See https://health.gov/healthypeople/tools -action/browse- evidence- based- resources/evidence- based- resources . 18 An ECD champion is a health center staff member, typically a physician, who guides ECD program activities and promotes the health center's practice transformation efforts. The ECD champion does not need to be in a leadership role but should have the skills, influence, and expertise to advance project implementation. The champion encourages practice transformation by engaging team members, informing revised workflows, patient and family engagement, integrated delivery models, team- based care coordination, leveraging health information technology, use of data- driven processes, advancement of health equity, and implementation of clinical guidelines. 19 The two- generation approach describes services and approaches that build family well -being by intentionally and simultaneously working with children and the adults in their lives together. The approach recognizes that families come in all different shapes and sizes and that the health and well -being of family members are interconnected. See https://aspe.hhs.gov/resources -developing- implementing- two- generation- approaches . HRSA -23-028 8 violence to support the health and health- related social needs of the primary caregiver and their role in supporting healthy early childhood development.20 HRSA also encourages you to establish or enhance partnerships with state/local health departments, federal programs, Native American Tribal organizations, Early Head Start and Head Start programs, community and faith- based organizations, and/or other relevant ECD -focused programs. These partnerships may facilitate referrals of children and families in need of ECD services to your health center for recommended developmental screening and needed follow -up services. Additionally, these partnerships may support the delivery of comprehensive ECD services to children and families in your service area. See Appendix C for a list of partners and resources that may be of assistance with your project. Program -Specific Instructions In addition to application requirements and instructions in Sections 4 and 5 of HRSA's SF-424 Two-Tier Application Guide (including the budget, budget narrative , staffing plan and personnel requirements, assurances, certifications, and abstract), include the following : i. Project Abstract Use the Standard OMB -approved Project Abstract Summary Form that is included in the workspace application package.

Review and Selection Process The objective review process provides an objective evaluation of applications to the individuals responsible for making award decisions . The highest ranked applications receive consideration for award within available funding ranges . HRSA may also consider assessment of risk and the other pre -award activities described in Section 3 below. HRSA -23-028 25 In addition to the ranking based on merit criteria, HRSA approving officials will apply other factors in merit selection. S ee section 6.3 of HRSA's SF-424 Two-Tier Application Guide f or more details . For this program, HRSA will use distribution of awards, as well as H80 award and compliance status, as award factor s as described below. Rural/Urban Distribution of Awards Aggregate awards in FY 2023 will be made to ensure that the ratio of rural to urban target populations is not less than two to three or greater than three to two as set forth in section 330(e)(6)(B) of the PHS Act. To ensure this distribution, HRSA may award funding to applications out of rank order. Compliance Status 33 You will not receive ECD funding if you meet any of the following exclusion criteria at the time HRSA makes funding decisions: You are no longer an active Health Center Program (H80) award recipient under sections 330(e), (g), (h), and/or (i), or You have a 30- day condition on your H80 award related to Health Center Program requirement area(s). 3. Assessment of Risk HRSA may apply special conditions of award or elect not to fund applicants with management or financial instability that directly relates to the organization's ability to implement statutory, regulatory , or other requirements 45 CFR \u00a7 75.205 ). HRSA reviews a pplications receiving a favorable objective review for other considerations that include past performance, as applicable ; cost analysis of the project/program budget ; assessment of your management systems, ensuring continued applicant eligibility ; and compliance with any public policy requirements, including those requiring just -in-time submissions. HRSA may ask you to submi t additional programmatic or administrative information (such as an updated budget or \"other support\" information) or to undertake certain activities (such as negotiation of an indirect cost rate) in anticipation of an award. However, even at this point in the process, such requests do not guarantee that HRSA will make an award. Following review of all applicable information, HRSA's approving, and business management officials will determine whether HRSA can make an award if special conditions are required, and what level of funding is appropriate. Award decisions are discretionary and are not subject to appeal to any HRSA or HHS official or board. HRSA is required to review and consider any information about your organization that is in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System ( FAPIIS) . You may review and comment on any information about your organization that a federal awarding agency previously entered. HRSA will consider your comments, in addition to 33 See Chapter 2: Health Center Program Oversight of the Compliance Manual. HRSA -23-028 26 other information in FAPIIS in making a judgment about your organization's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk as described in 45 CFR \u00a7 75.205 HHS Awarding Agency Review of Risk Posed by Applicants . HRSA will report to FAPIIS a determination that an applicant is not qualified ( 45 CFR \u00a7 75.212 ). VI. Award Administration Information 1.
