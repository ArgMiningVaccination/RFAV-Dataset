Industrial Uses/IUS-4/December 1994 3Introduction Development and Commercialization of Biobased Materials Continue USDA's Alternative Agricultural Research and Commercialization Board recently made initial selections of projects to be funded in fiscal 1995. USDA's Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service is working with the U.S. Department of Defense to develop advanced materials from renewable resources. To date, USDA's Agricultural Research Service has negotiated over 425 cooperative research and development agreements with industrial partners. DOE's Alternative Feedstocks Program has developed a thermal/chemical clean fractionation process that is being evaluated by industry.

The Most CSREES Programs Continue Center requires at least a 50-percent match in funds and negotiates a payback arrangement for each project. The Industrial use programs administered by USDA's Center received $6.5 million in funding for fiscal 1995.

Other rates went up (figure 1), Most analysts expect strong business-equipment spending reflecting the rise in the Federal funds rate, expected because profits have been increasing and are expected to future tightenings, and increases in credit demand as our continue rising in 1995. major trading partners recover. Most analysts expect the Fed to push up interest rates again next year. Consumer prices are expected to rise 3.4 percent in 1995. Given this anticipated inflation and continued strength in Because of these interest rate hikes, GDP growth was industrial production, the Federal Reserve Board (Fed) is slightly slower than it would have been otherwise in the expected to put more upward pressure on short-term third quarter of 1994.

Industrial uses of corn are forecast to reach 748 million bushels in 1994/95, up 12 percent from 1993/94. Cornstarch is used to make sorbitol, a polyol widely used in personal-care products. Ethanol Had a Busy Year in 1994 resolved before the RFG program has been in effect a long time. The Court order lays out a schedule for EPA, the The year began with ethanol supporters, oil companies, oil industry, and the Renewable Fuels Association to file agricultural interests, and the U.S. Environmental legal briefs with the Court. The last set of briefs is due Protection Agency (EPA) continuing their debate over January 12, 1995, and oral arguments likely will begin what role ethanol will play in the Clean Air Act's shortly thereafter. A final decision is expected in the reformulated gasoline (RFG) program. EPA had spring. announced their decision in December 1993 to require 30 percent of the oxygen in RFG be derived from renewable The RFG program will begin on January 1, 1995, in all sources. This \"renewable oxygenate requirement\" (ROR) areas that are mandated or have opted into the program. would guarantee ethanol a role in the RFG program. Annual demand for RFG is expected to be about 36 billion gallons, all of which must contain at least 2.0-percent On January 14, 1994, EPA held a public hearing on the oxygen by weight. Oxygen can be added to gasoline in ROR and testimony was given by witnesses representing the form of alcohols or ethers made from alcohols. oil companies, agricultural interests, environmental groups, Currently, there are three oxygenates that are expected to state regulatory agencies, and public interest groups. This be widely used in RFG: ethanol, ethyl tertiary butyl ether hearing was followed by a 30-day comment period during (ETBE) made from ethanol, and methyl tertiary butyl ether which written comments and other documents were placed (MTBE) made from methanol. in the official record. All three can be used to produce RFG, but ethers like USDA submitted comments indicating strong support for ETBE and MTBE have some advantages over ethanol. the Administration's decision and pointing out the many First, RFG made with ethers can be shipped in pipelines; benefits this rule would have on U.S. agriculture. USDA ethanol blends cannot because they attract water. Second, estimated full implementation of the ROR would increase ethanol increases the evaporation rate of gasoline. For this net ethanol demand by 500 million gallons annually. This reason, ethanol cannot be mixed with other RFG fuels increase would account for an additional 200 million because the evaporative emissions contribute to smog bushels of corn use. Added to the 1.25 billion gallons of formation. ETBE, however, does not increase evaporation; production expected in 1994, ethanol production would in fact, it reduces evaporation significantly. A common increase to more than 1.7 billion gallons by crop year misunderstanding about ETBE is that it uses less ethanol 1997/98. to make a gallon of RFG. This is not true. The oxygen in ETBE comes from ethanol. Therefore, to make a EPA issued a final ROR regulation on June 30, 1994, gallon of RFG using ETBE, just as much ethanol is which would require 15 percent renewable oxygen in RFG needed for ETBE as would be needed for blending ethanol during 1995 and 30 percent thereafter. However, on July directly into the fuel. 13, 1994, the American Petroleum Institute and the National Petroleum Refiners Association filed suit in the With the Court stay in place, many have wondered what U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia asking the future holds for the ethanol industry. Difficulties the Court to overrule EPA and find the ROR illegal. associated with using ethanol in RFG, because of mixing While many expected this challenge by the oil industry, and blending restrictions, were thought to put ethanol at a ROR supporters are pleased with the aggressive response disadvantage in RFG markets. ETBE has been more EPA has made toward this suit. expensive than MTBE because methanol has been cheaper than ethanol and it contains less oxygen than methanol. A On September 13, 1994, the Appeals Court ordered EPA recent market development that could promote the use of to stay its implementation of ROR.

Prices for starch are be eligible for the same excise tax exemption now generally negotiated between buyer and seller and depend available to ethanol and other qualifying alcohols. This upon size of purchase, amount of modification done to the ruling will remove significant economic barriers to ETBE starch, and competition among sellers.

Recent plant breeding, agronomic research, and oil-product development are bringing meadowfoam closer to commercial viability. Polyols, which are traditionally derived from petrochemicals, are now being made from vegetable oils. Meadowfoam Is Commercially Produced in Oregon yield variation have not all been identified, but differing levels of insect pollination appears to be part of the cause. Meadowfoam is a low-growing winter annual native to the Pacific Northwest.

This composition imparts production program for meadowfoam. This program was considerable oxidative stability, which is required in expanded in 1980 as a result of funding from the Oregon cosmetics and is potentially useful in lubricants. Another grass-seed industry, which was searching for alternative special feature of meadowfoam's dominant fatty acids is crops for the poorly drained soils of the Willamette Valley the location of the double bond at the unusual delta-5 and a way to lessen the pollution resulting from the field position. This allows chemists to make products that burning required after harvesting grass seed.

Industrial Uses/IUS-4/December 1994 19Special Article Biogas Production from Animal Manures: What Is the Potential? by Donald L. Van Dyne and J. Alan Weber' Abstract: Livestock producers who operate large-scale confinement operations, such as dairies and hog farms, are looking for ways to handle and dispose of animal wastes that are cost effective and meet odor and pollution regulations. Farm-level production of biogas (using anaerobic digesters) is one solution for livestock producers that also will help control methane emissions into the atmosphere. Methane is a greenhouse gas that contributes to potential global warming. Biogas is 60- to 65-percent methane; carbon dioxide and trace amounts of water and other gases, such as hydrogen sulfide, account for the remaining 35 to 40 percent. It is a medium-Btu fuel that can be used to generate electricity or burned in natural-gas or propane boilers and space heaters. Heat, fertilizer, and soil amendments are coproducts of the digestion process that contribute to its economic viability. In general, with current technologies, anaerobic digesters require warm climates, large volumes of manure, high local electricity rates, and daily maintenance and management to be profitable. The Federal government, through the AgSTAR Program, is promoting biogas production as a way of generating extra income for farmers, reducing greenhouse gasses, and improving water quality. Four case studies demonstrate that farm-level production of biogas is feasible under local conditions. Keywords: livestock manure, methane, anaerobic digesters, biogas. Methane-recovery systems and anaerobic digesters first The first comprehensive Federal efforts to improve water gained popularity in the United States during the 1970's. quality were implemented in the early 1970's with the At the time, alternative energy sources were promoted due passage of the Clean Water Act (CWA).

Since then, improved technology and increased systems, and dead-animal disposal facilities. concern for the environment have renewed interest in the feasibility and use of methane-recovery systems.

Power' Abstract: Lignin, a common material in trees and woody plants, is currently a byproduct of pulp and paper production. However, joint research at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the Institute of Paper Science and Technology is aimed at broadening commercial uses of lignin. One project is assessing the potential of converting lignin into anthraquinone-like pulping catalysts. Anthraquinone (AQ) improves kraft pulping, but its cost, which ranges from $4.00 to $4.50 per pound, hinders widespread use. Three processes for converting lignin into pulping catalysts were evaluated for their technical and economic feasibility. Preliminary results indicate that two of the processes appear viable. Amortized production costs for using lignin from kraft pulping, without intermediate conversion to vanillin and syringaldehyde, and lignin from organosolv pulping were estimated to be $1.24 and 79 cents per pound, respectively. Comparing these two processes to competing petrochemical- based, AQ-producing methods, showed that the lignin-based routes were potentially the most cost effective. catalysts, anthraquinone, kraft pulping, organosolv pulping. Lignin, the material in trees and woody plants that fuel during recovery of the pulping chemicals. The kraft differentiates them from herbaceous plants, is one of the method is widely used because it rapidly separates the most underused renewable sources of carbon.

AQ has been key factors: the process must be inexpensive, suggested as a key component in the development of environmentally benign, and fit well with existing pulping new processes that pulp wood for longer periods of technology. The NREL-IPST approach to the synthesis of time to remove greater amounts of lignin. In the past, pulping catalysts from lignin is divided into two stages: such processes resulted in unacceptable decreases in lignin processing and chemical processing. the yield and strength of the pulp. In the presence of AQ, however, yield and strength are maintained even The lignin processing stage involves selectively isolating during long-term pulping runs. These new processes a low-molecular-weight (LMW) fraction from lignin (11). decrease the amount of residual lignin in the pulp and, In theory, whole lignin could be used directly in the thus, reduce the amount of bleaching needed to obtain subsequent chemical-processing stage.

The second stage of the process, chemical processing of the LMW fraction, involves two steps. First, the LMW Making AQ From Lignin lignin is oxidized to give a mixture of benzoquinones (intermediate chemicals whose structure makes up the core Despite the reported advantages of AQ-catalyzed pulping, of AQ). Second, the benzoquinones are converted to the current cost of AQ, which ranges from $4.00 to $4.50 pulping catalysts by adding chemicals with the appropriate per pound, hinders its general use, except under certain number of carbons.

Environmental issues include water quality, soil erosion, deforesta- tion, product safety, and the protection of wildlife and biodiversity. These reports address how policy measures adopted to deal with environmental issues may affect agricultural trade. Environmental Policies: Implications for Agricultural Trade. 145 pp. June 1994. This report, consisting of 14 separate articles, analyzes linkages between environmental policies and agricultural trade. Topics covered include a global inventory of environmental policies, the implications of environmental policies on U.S. and world agricultural trade, the implications for environmental policy in the context of multilateral and regional trade negotiations, and the effects of global climate change on agricultural trade.To order these reports, please call Stock # FAER-252 $15.00 1-800-999-6779 (outside the U.S. and Canada, please call Global Review of Resource and Environmental 1-703-834-0125). VISA Policies: Water Resource Development and and MasterCard Management. accepted. 90 pp. June 1994. This report reviews how 30 countries develop and manage their water resources. Because the focus of the report is on agriculture, particular attention is given to irrigation. The study found that differing climatic conditions, demand for water, and historical situations led to diverse laws, policies, and administrative structures across countries.

USDA TO HOLD AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK FORUM The U.S. Department of Agriculture will hold its first agricultural economic forum on February 22 and 23, 1995, in Washington, D.C. The forum will replace the 70-year-old outlook conference that USDA traditionally held each December. Responding to feedback from outlook conference participants and information users, the conference is being redesigned to add a new longer-term focus that will help farmers, agribusiness, and policy officials make strategic decisions for the future. Specific details on the forum will be announced later.
