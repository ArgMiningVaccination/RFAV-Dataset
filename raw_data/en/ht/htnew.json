This update included authorizing the current bivalent vaccines (original and omicron BA.4/BA.5 strains) to be used for all doses administered to individuals 6 months of age and older, including for an additional dose or doses for certain populations. COVID-19 Vaccine Information COVID-19 Vaccines On April 18, 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) amended the emergency use authorizations (EUA) of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 bivalent mRNA vaccines. This update included authorizing the current bivalent vaccines (original and omicron BA.4/BA.5 strains) to be used for all doses administered to individuals six months of age and older, including for an additional dose or doses for certain populations. The monovalent Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines are no longer authorized for use in the United States. Most individuals may receive a single dose of a bivalent vaccine. Certain individuals may be eligible for additional doses depending on age and immunocompromised status. Most unvaccinated individuals may receive a single dose of a bivalent vaccine, rather than multiple doses of the original monovalent mRNA vaccines. Latest Vaccine Updates The State Surgeon General Dr. Joseph A. Ladapo has announced [new guidance](https://floridahealthcovid19.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/20221007-guidance-mrna-covid19-vaccines-doc.pdf?utm_source=floridahealth.gov&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=newsroom&utm_content=article&url_trace_7f2r5y6=https://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2022/10/20220512-guidance-mrna-covid19-vaccine.pr.html) regarding mRNA vaccines. The Florida Department of Health conducted an [analysis](https://floridahealthcovid19.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/20221007-guidance-mrna-covid19-vaccines-analysis.pdf?utm_source=floridahealth.gov&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=newsroom&utm_content=article&url_trace_7f2r5y6=https://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2022/10/20220512-guidance-mrna-covid19-vaccine.pr.html) through a [self-controlled case series,](https://www.bmj.com/content/354/bmj.i4515?utm_source=floridahealth.gov&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=newsroom&utm_content=article&url_trace_7f2r5y6=https://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2022/10/20220512-guidance-mrna-covid19-vaccine.pr.html) which is a technique originally developed to evaluate vaccine safety. This analysis found that there is an 84% increase in the relative incidence of cardiac-related death among males 18-39 years old within 28 days following mRNA vaccination. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration [updated the emergency use authorizations](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-moderna-pfizer-biontech-bivalent-covid-19-vaccines-use) of the Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna vaccine for administration of a single booster at least two months after a primary or booster dose is given to help protect against the COVID-19 omicron variant. Adults aged 18 and up are eligible to receive the Moderna booster, while anyone 12 and up are eligible to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech booster. Based on currently available data, healthy children aged 5-17 may not benefit from receiving the currently available COVID-19 vaccine.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) revised the [Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) for monoclonal antibody treatments, [discontinuing their use by any U.S. state or jurisdiction](https://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2022/01/20220124-fda-removes-treatment-authorization.pr.html?_ga=2.206559377.303257163.1649808273-972589536.1647977221).
