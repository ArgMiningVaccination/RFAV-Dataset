Top 4 Causes for seeking Naturopathy for Low Energy: - Nutrient Deficiencies and Fatigue - Nutrition and Low Energy - Stress and Fatigue - Thyroid function and Low Energy Nutrient Deficiencies and Fatigue Some of the leading nutrient deficiencies that Dr. Jennah will investigate for are: iron deficiency, B12 deficiency, and Vitamin D deficiency. One of the leading causes of fatigue and low energy levels, actually has a lot to do with the fuel you're putting in your body on a daily basis (and I'm not talking about coffee and energy drinks here). Specific nutrient deficiencies can impact the way our body functions, and make us feel tired day in and day out when our blood levels are not adequate. Some of the leading nutrient deficiencies that Dr. Jennah will investigate for are: iron deficiency, B12 deficiency, and Vitamin D deficiency. These levels can be assessed easily and quickly, with the use of a simple blood test. It's important to note that vegetarians, vegans, and menstruating women are at higher risk for some of these nutrient deficiencies than others. If you fall into one of these categories, and have been feeling your energy levels lacking, then you should consider working alongside a naturopathic doctor to optimize diet and nutrition.

Nutrition and Low Energy If you've already found out that your specific nutrient levels are adequate, then it's time to look more into meal timing as well as energy and macronutrient intake. Our energy levels are closely linked to our blood glucose (a sugar that's used as energy by the body) level fluctuations. If we're eating at irregular times, or cramming in a quick bowl of sugary breakfast cereal before heading to work, then this is not setting us up for all day energy. Ensuring that blood glucose levels remain relatively stable throughout the day can help our workplace warriors avoid that afternoon slump. If you notice that every afternoon you have to drag yourself to the coffee shop around 2pm, just to ensure you'll survive until 5pm, then chances are your blood glucose levels are to blame. By eating a proper balance of carbohydrates, protein, and fat, we can help to regulate these blood levels remain stable, and you keep brain fog, low energy, and fatigue at bay. Stress and Fatigue Stress. It originally kept us safe by teaching us how to run away from sabre tooth tigers, but in today's day and age, it's actually harming more than it's helping. Our body secretes a stress hormone called cortisol in response to chronic stress (things like workplace, personal, and financial stressors). When our levels of cortisol are constantly elevated, our body can no longer adapt as it used to, leading us to feel low energy, fatigue, and sometimes even anxiety. This is sometimes called adrenal fatigue, due to the fact that cortisol is produced and released by the adrenal glands. You may also have heard it termed as \"burnout\". Herbal, acupuncture, and nutritional support are all ways in which Dr. Jennah will support your cortisol levels to help increase your energy and banish your fatigue for good. Thyroid function and Low Energy By addressing an underlying under-active thyroid, energy levels tend to increase, weight loss becomes easier, and you start feeling great again. Your thyroid is a small butterfly shaped gland that sits at the front of your throat, just beneath the chin. When your thyroid is under functioning, it may result in symptoms of low energy, fatigue, cold hands and feet, as well as consistent weight gain (without any changes to diet and exercise). Dr. Jennah first addresses this cause of low energy and fatigue, by running blood work to assess your current level of thyroid function. If she finds that you have hypothyroidism (under functioning thyroid, which results in high levels of a hormone called TSH), then you will work together to come up with a comprehensive herbal, nutritional, and dietary treatment plan to help bring your thyroid function back to normal. By addressing an underlying under-active thyroid, energy levels tend to increase, weight loss becomes easier, and you start feeling great again.
