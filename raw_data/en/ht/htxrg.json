Andrew Linnell, [jandrewlinnell@yahoo.com](mailto:jandrewlinnell@yahoo.com) Here we are in the Technological Age. We feel its effects that challenge our sense of humanity. We are also concerned for our health and well-being. Rudolf Steiner spoke of the cultivation of spiritual science as the principal counterforce. Contact the local branch representative for further information Are Thoresen, MVD, will explore insights into the Three Elemental Realms that he gained while incapacitated by Covid in 2020. Since 1981, Are has operated a holistic private veterinary practice in Sandefjord, Norway. He has also trained in acupuncture, homeopathy, and anthroposophical medicine. He has published over 25 papers and 10 books and given lectures and workshops about his research at various venues including MysTech conferences. Are's current research has focused on Vidar and Balder, who stand as guardians to the threshold of the outer etheric world to open the Northern Way of Initiation. His research covers the Vidar-school as a continuation of the Michael-school, the Christianization of bio-dynamic agriculture, and the individual qualities of the Three Elemental Realms. In his works, Are explores human potential for spiritual knowledge and new spiritual experiences in our time. A good reference concerning Vidar can be found in this lecture by Rudolf Steiner: [https://rsarchive.org/Lectures/19100617p01.html](https://rsarchive.org/Lectures/19100617p01.html?fbclid=IwAR3LF2tAroradV5RheJqqOtZS8YcTo1WZ6LcK3LCV-tGDxSbTTbtjpjCpzs).
