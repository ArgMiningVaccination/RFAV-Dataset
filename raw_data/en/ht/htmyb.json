Dr. Carri Cook built an amazing family practice that served the families of Orange County and the surrounding areas. She hired me in 2018, and sold me the practice in 2020. I was called to Active Duty late 2021 and learned that it was hard to maintain a thriving business many states away. With the extension of my military orders, and the wonderful doctors that helped run NLC in my absence moving on to better endeavors, I had to make the abrupt choice to close the doors for good. I understand this news is sudden and I tried to do what I could to prevent this from occurring. Dr. Sam and Dr. Sean are opening a practice soon near by. To keep up with their progress, follow them at [https://www.facebook.com/familyfirstchirooc](https://www.facebook.com/familyfirstchirooc) and [https://www.instagram.com/familyfirstchirooc](https://www.instagram.com/familyfirstchirooc) Dr. Danielle now practice's in Huntington Beach at [https://www.instagram.com/mommaschiro/](https://www.instagram.com/mommaschiro/) Dr. Ivy is finishing up her Doctorate of Acupuncture and had to return to school and teaching full time. And I, Dr. Sai, is still stationed at Ft. Bliss, for the remainder of 2023. I will keep this site, the facebook and instagram accounts open for at least a year to keep you all updated with Dr. Sam's practice and what is next in my life. I can also be contacted at [DrSai@naturallifechiro.com](mailto:DrSai@naturallifechiro.com) Thank you to all the NLC families and friends for an amazing and memorable 5 years. Until we meet again. - In Health, Dr. Saira Zimmerman, DC "}
