The name of this treatment immediately inspires comparison to acupuncture, and there are indeed some similarities between these two treatment options. They are, of course, not the same, as Biopuncture is an injection therapy in which we inject an ultra-low dose of a therapeutic solution. The solution is composed of different ingredients depending on the condition being treated, though we most commonly include Traumeel in our injectable solutions. There are many reasons for a patient to explore the use of Biopuncture as a treatment option, including any of the following: - Acute or chronic injuries - Sports injuries - Stress injuries - Injuries caused by poor posture or improper biomechanics - Tension headaches - Migraines This treatment option is exceptionally useful and is certainly not limited to the above conditions. We have also used Biopuncture to successfully treat injuries to the back, knee, ankle, wrist and shoulder, along with certain chronic injuries that lingered and simply would not heal. Biopuncture Features Several Similarities to Acupuncture Acupuncture, which is another treatment option that we offer, is used to stimulate a healing response. Biopuncture similarly stimulates a healing response within the body, though it employs a different means of stimulation. Acupuncture stimulates the healing response by targeting specific areas of the body for the purpose of channeling chi, and while Biopuncture also targets specific areas of the body, the healing response is generated through the combination of the solution being injected and the site into which it is injected. Components of the Injection Therapy Solution The most common component of the injectable solution used in Biopuncture is Traumeel, which has been tested for safety in numerous clinical studies and found to aid in the healing of bruising, swelling and other trauma. The components that make up the solution will often differ depending on the nature of the injury, but they will quite often include some or all of the following: - Homeopathic medicines - Herbal remedies - Vitamins and/or minerals - Dextrose - Lidocaine - Traumeel It is important to again note that the nature of the injection will vary from patient to patient, as the injection's components will be determined based on the ailment being treated. Excellent Therapeutic Option for Pain Management As a means for pain management, Biopuncture is an excellent option. There is a great deal of anecdotal evidence that patients experience immediate benefits after a single session of Biopuncture, and while there are those who immediately dismiss anecdotal evidence due to the possibility of the placebo effect, there is also clinical research that indicates the effectiveness of Biopuncture as a method of pain management. According to a peer-reviewed medical journal, Traumeel has been proven to inhibit IL-1\u00df and TNF-alpha secretion, both of which are immune mediators that have been associated with tissue damage and inflammation. Specific Benefits Afforded to Patients Throughout the course of our practice, we have seen the many benefits that our patients have experienced. The benefits apply to diverse injuries and issues, and it is safe to say that we have been very pleased with the results of the Biopuncture treatment. Biopuncture can be used to treat a variety of conditions among a variety of patients, as we have personally and successfully treated patients with groin muscle pulls, knee injuries from overuse, wrist weakness and a host of other issues. Each of these patients came to us with a different issue that needed to be addressed, and we were able to utilize Biopuncture quickly and effectively in treating these varied issues. Benefit Realization Varies Among Patients We have had a number of our patients tell us that they experienced immediate results from the Biopuncture treatment, but the length of time it takes for benefits to be realized can vary from patient to patient. The type of injury, its severity and the body's healing response time will all play a role in affecting the time in which healing takes place. Since this is a treatment that stimulates the healing response within the body, each individual patient may have different experiences. In some cases, one session may only be necessary while others may require more. Safety Is Not a Concern All of the products used in a Biopuncture solution are considered safe and have been thoroughly tested in clinical studies. In addition to the fact that many of the products that are used in the solution are natural and homeopathic, the solution itself is composed of ultra-low doses. This completely minimizes any risk that may exist, making the treatment itself a very safe process. What to Expect in a Biopuncture Session Just as each of our patients are different, so too are the injuries and ailments that they experience. We vary the solutions in Biopuncture injections based on the individual, and the sites of the injections will vary as well. Injections are typically done just below the skin, but they may also be injected into specific muscle points or ligaments. The injection is actually not like the common conception of an injection; it is more like a very small pinprick. The needle used in this process is very fine and only an ultra-low dose is administered.
