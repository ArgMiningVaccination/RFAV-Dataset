Upon its discovery in Germany in the 1500s, the arnica montana plant has been utilized for its many restorative properties. From discomfort to bruising discoloration, this herb has a wide range of health benefits. Boiron Arnica Montana 6C contains a highly concentrated form of the herb arnica montana so your body can experience all the benefits it has to offer, like: - Relief from muscle and joint aches caused by overuse* - Support for the body's response to inflammation* - Reduced symptoms of occasional pain and stiffness* - Healthier wound-healing process* - Support for helping the body repair bruised skin* While the arnica montana plant is known for its pain-alleviating properties, its level of dilution can alter how it affects your body. Homeopathic medicine has a specific way of measuring potency. A product with a potency level of 30C has been diluted more than a product with 6C \u2014 but the product with 30C affects the body in a more generalized way, whereas, the product with 6C targets a localized area of the body. Boiron Arnica Montana 6C contains a less diluted form of arnica montana, making it a higher concentration. This higher concentration is great for targeting localized areas of the body. Just pop some Boiron Arnica Montana 6C pellets under your tongue to help alleviate the discomfort that comes with small injuries like a bug bite, an achy joint, or a small bruise! Why not attack your pain from the inside and outside?
