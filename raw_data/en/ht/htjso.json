This question kind of took me by surprise because, to be honest, I don't even think about it anymore. After years of being fiercely committed, it has become so deeply ingrained in me that it's like brushing my teeth \u2014 I don't have to think about it, I just do it... Things like eating organic, drinking clean water, not drinking alcohol or coffee, moving my body, meditating twice a day, dry body brushing, scraping my tongue, getting to bed early, getting eight hour's sleep, spending time in nature and flexing my self-love muscle have all become so embedded in my way of life that they no longer feel like a chore, task, effort or burden. But, of course, creating these types of healthy habits takes time \u2014 and a deep-seated commitment to re-training your Mean Girl programming. I often hear people commenting that they are too stressed, that they don't have enough time to be organised or to prepare nourishing food, and that 'quick and cheap' is just... well, quicker and easier. I also hear others say that they get too influenced by outsiders \u2014 when their partners or friends want to get a pizza, a bottle of wine, and a tub of ice cream, it's just 'easier' to go along with them and follow the crowd. Or when your girlfriends ask you out for a cocktail, FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) sets in, and even though it's not your truth you end up going out anyway. It's important to know that feeling fabulously healthy is a journey \u2014 one I'm still on. It's a process which takes commitment, dedication and persistence. Like everything else in life, you get out of it what you put into it. And it doesn't just happen overnight, you must keep at it every single day. For me, there are two key things that help me stay on track and moving forward on my path to wellness... 1. Staying Committed To Your 'Why' We all want to feel fabulously healthy, vital and strong... but WHY? Why do you want that? It's not a question we often ask ourselves. Is it because you want to be able to run around the park with your kids without feeling exhausted? Because you want to compete in the local women's fun run? Because you want to be able to go out dancing with your girlfriends? Or even just to get up the stairs at work without puffing and panting? For me personally, my why is because I freakin' love the way it makes me feel. I love feeling energetic, vital and fabulously healthy... who doesn't?! When I feel like this, I am able to play cricket with my boys, take beautiful long walks with my soul sisters, and do a barre class or yoga without feeling like I am going to pass out. I also have another why... one day I want to have a baby. And I want to make sure I am the healthiest I can be in order to create a beautiful and healthy bub. I understand and know that whatever health stuff I may have going on, I will 100% pass onto my baby, and I don't want that. I want to give that little bubba the best possible chance at thriving, and if that's the case, I have to show up and play my part. As a side note, my husband does too \u2014 when it comes to creating a bundle of joy, it takes two to tango and ladies, your men have just as much to do with creating a healthy baby as you do (but that's another whole post!). So what is your why? Why do you want to be fabulously healthy and stay on your health journey? 2. Educate Yourself I think where people often fall off the bandwagon is with education. Once you understand and know what you know, you can't 'unknow' it. So for me, there's no way I could go and down a bottle of champers, a packet of chips, a can of Coke, a block of chocolate and a tub of Ben and Jerry's, because I know too much. I know that that isn't the best choice for me and I know it won't make me feel fabulously healthy. SO why would I do it! Education is key when it come to wellness. Once you know something, you can't unknow it! Do whatever it takes to get the knowledge you need to make the best choices for you and your family. Unless you have one of those zappers from Men In Black that erase your memory (which I'm pretty sure isn't the case!), you can't unknow what you know. So in order for you to stay on your path, remember: knowledge is key! Read books, take courses, listen to podcasts while you do the housework, hire a coach, watch documentaries \u2014 whatever feels best and most inspiring for you. We need to stay curious and be students for life. Constantly seeking out knowledge is the best way to ensure you're keeping up to date, making the right choices for you, and staying committed to your health and wellness journey. Now I want to hear from you \u2014 What is your why? Why do you want to feel fabulously healthy? Share with me in the comments below. Then I want you to write it on a Post-it note and stick it on your bathroom mirror so you can constantly stay connected to it. Remember, so many beautiful souls from all over the world come here to be inspired daily and your comment might be the one thing to ignite massive shifts for the better.
