As a homeopath I am interested in understanding a patient's general state of physical, emotional and mental wellbeing as well as the symptoms for which the patient is consulting. The remedy, is found in a substance that naturally produces similar symptoms of the acute and general nature the person is presenting at the time. This homeopathic theory is known as \"like cures like\". I enlighten my practice with anthroposophy which supports an wholistic practice of recognising the physical, soul and spiritual elements of the human being in relationship to health. Upon the application of this research and practice the understanding of the human being is extensively broadened and helps me to understand the combination and potency of the remedies that I prescribe. The remedies Minerals, plants, animals and metals are taken through pharmaceutical processes including potentisation which starts with a raw substance combined with a carrier substance that is diluted and agitated, each time creating a remedy with a different level of potency. The level of potentiation affects different processes in the body. You are welcome to be in touch to understand more about the way that I work. The consultation An initial one hour consultation allows time to discuss the symptoms to be addressed and also bring to light patterns of an individual's health and illness processes. Depending on the circumstances a few days for research and reflection may be left between the consultation and the preparation of a prescription. The prescription can include remedies to be taken daily for short or ongoing periods as well as [compresses](https://www.seasalthomeopathy.com.au/therapeutic-applications/) and [baths. ](https://www.seasalthomeopathy.com.au/jungebad-oil-dispersion-baths/) In subsequent consultations changes are noted to the original presenting symptoms as well as to energy levels, motivation, the ability to cope with the illness, changes in sleep, appetite and moods, and anything new that may have arisen. Sometimes processes that are unresolved or dormant from previous illnesses or life events come to the surface. The whole case is reviewed so as to refine the prescription to meet the changes. When it is not possible to meet in the clinic, the consultation may be conducted by [phone or video.](https://www.atms.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ATMS-Online-Audio-Visual-Consultation-Policy-V3-2020.pdf?x93630) Initial Consultation $120 (1 hour) This rate reduces to $100 when more than one member of a family from the same income stream are having regular consultations. Subsequent Consultations $40 - $100 Family members can share an appointment time $100 (1 hour) $75 (3/4 hour) $60 (1/2 hour) $40 (1/4 hour) A package rate can be arranged for those that require on-call healthcare. Home Visits $90 Home visits are only available for circumstances such as may be required for end of life. The fee is in addition to the consultation fee. Child Observations (Offsite) $120 (1 hour) This can be arranged between the parent, teacher and myself when a family is consulting to support a child. Remedies $20 each on average The average prescription has two remedies (plus postage when applicable). Some remedies are more expensive, as are oils and ointments that could be part of a prescription. Frequently Asked Questions Kits build over time as family illness tendencies unfold and familiarity with their action and indications comes about in consultation and use. However having on hand something for broken bones, fevers, bruises and the first sign of a flu can be very useful. Recommendations can be made within the consultation or workshops. A standard homeopathic kit with vials of remedy-coated sugar pillules comes in handy, but the remedies prescribed in consultation are usually from [Southern Swan Pharmacy ](http://www.southernswan.net.au/the-medicines.html)that supply liquid remedies in 30 ml bottles, or else from [Weleda](http://www.weleda.co.nz/discover-weleda/w3/i1003770/) and [WALA. ](http://www.wala.de/english/trademarks/remedies/) These remedies are more often than not specially combined with more than one medicinal substance. When prescribing for a child it is important to have time without the child being present because it helps to obtain information that the child need not hear. Therefore arrangements are made to speak about the child separately to meeting the child. The consultations build pictures around a child's health including birth, milestones, sleep, digestion, behaviour, sensory development, susceptibility to illnesses and environmental influences that help parents to understand the individual needs of their child. Education towards home healthcare is a very important part of working with parents. And many parents choose to consult and work on their own health and other issues that may be influencing their child's health. A face-to-face consultation is preferred and in some cases necessary. However an audio- visual consultation is possible when a person cannot attend a consultation in clinic. [Read more](https://www.seasalthomeopathy.com.au/distance-consultations/). For the cases of children it is common to meet the child then speak with the parents over the phone. Yes. But like all medicines each health practitioner should be aware of what medicines a person is taking and the purpose of taking them so that they can prescribe the appropriate dose and work together to support health. This depends on how long a person has been unwell. Some illnesses work in daily cycles, others weekly, monthly or annually. Generally 6 doses is a good indicator of the efficacy of the remedy in the case of a first aid treatment. In the case of symptoms that have been present for a while, 3 months usually indicates the direction and action of the treatment. When symptoms have been stubborn to shift and caused fatigue, the first improvement is often observed by an increase in energy. The length of time that symptoms have been present can also affect how long it takes to heal; the newest symptom is often the first to resolve and the oldest symptom can take the longest. Using potentised medicines can sometimes cause a return of old symptoms in some people who have been treated in the past with medicines that have \"paused\" the symptoms without having had the underlying process addressed. This presents the opportunity to work through the underlying cause and resolve the disposition to related illness patterns. "}
