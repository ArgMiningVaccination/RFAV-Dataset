On October 12, Neles' Board announced there were no ongoing discussions with Valmet and repeated the recommendation for Alfa Laval's PTO. President and CEO Olli Isotalo : During the third quarter, the market continued to be mixed. As during the first half, we were successful in winning important Pulp and Paper projects. As already anticipated in our half -year review , the Oil and Gas project situation slowe d during the third quarte r compared with the high level of activity in the first half of the year. During the third quarter, our Services and MRO -driven business es saw increasing market activity in many market areas compared with the second quarter , but continue d to be negatively impacted by postponements in customers ' planned large maintenance shutdowns, mobility restrictions and lockdowns , as well as customers ' tightening cash management actions . The increased market activity in Services and MRO -driven business es has therefore yet to materialize in orders. Our sales grew 2% sequentially from the second to the third quarter , despite negative impact from exchange rates . Thanks to the continued cost saving actions that we had already initiated during the second quarter , we were able to maintain solid profitability during the reporting period , despite the low sales volume . Cost savings included temporary measures such as reduced working time, which we plan to mostly end during the fourth quarter . In the second quarter, w e also undertook some permanent cost -saving actions , mainly in the US and Finland, from which we already started to see savings during the third quarter. We also increas ingly focused on managing our net working capital and cash flows and achieved a reduction in our inventory levels. During the third quarter , there has been considerable debate about , and public interest in the ownership situation of Neles Oyj. In the mi dst of this, management and employees have been focusing on daily business , servi ng customers and executing the growth strategy Neles' Board approved on July 1. Market outlook We expect the market activity in Pulp and Paper projects to continue at a good level. Market activity in Oil and Gas projects is expected to continue to decline from the good level in the first half of the year, due to general economic concerns. Postponements and global uncertainties are reducing visibility in the Oil and Gas project business. J\u00ad43 Neles' Interim Report January - September 2020 Market activity for Services and the customer Maintenance, Repair and Operations -driven (MRO) business es is expected to gradually improve from the suppresse d levels during the reporting period , because customers' operations are resuming to a more normal level. Lar ge shutdowns are still being postponed due to the Covid - 19 pandemic situation and customers ' tightening cash management actions . The ongoing Covid -19 pandemic continues to create uncertainties and risks of abrupt changes in all markets. Covid -19 pandemic update The Covid -19 pandemic continues to pose significant short -term risks and uncertainties for the markets. The spread and severity of the pandemic continue to be difficult to predict. Abrupt measures taken by various national and local governments to restrict the spread of the virus have increased the unpredictability of the demand for Neles' products and services. The pandemic -related mobility restrictions have impacted Neles' operations by restricting Neles' ability to provide services at customer sites , as well as the running of manufacturing sites when lockdowns were imposed. These unc ertainties are expected to continue in the fourth quarter . In the third quarter, customers have returned to more normalized operations compared to the second quarter, but larg e maintenance projects are still largely postponed due to mobility restrictions and tightening cash management by customers. The situation has caused slow -down in Services and MRO -driven business es. Also, due to earlier shutdowns, there has been some deter ioration in supplier delivery times during the third quarter. Thus far, Neles has experienced no material credit losses or cancelations of orders in the order backlog. During the second and third quarters, management took proactive measures to ensure the safety of employees , and to control costs and preserve cash flow to protect Neles' financial position. The measures included a variety of enforced safety procedures at manufacturing sites, remote working and strict travel restrictions, cuts on external spend ing across the organization , as well as cost -saving and optimization activities. Increased attention was also paid to managing net working capital. There is an increased risk that global economic growth will significantly deteriorate because of the pandemic , which, with uncertain political and trade -related developments, could affect Neles' customer industries, reduce investment appetite and customer spending, thus weaken ing the demand for Neles' products and services , as well as affect ing the compan y's business operations and profitability. There are also other market - and customer -related risks that could cause planned and ongoing projects to be postponed, delayed or discontinued. Neles ' Interim Report January - September 2020 Orders , Sales and Operating environment Market activity was mixed during the reporting period. On the one hand, investment projects in the Pulp and Paper industry active ly continued during the reporting period. Oil and Gas project activity was strong in the first half of the year but decreased during the third quarter. On the other hand , the impacts of the Covid -19 pandemic have led to cancelations and postponements of customers' planned site work and maintenance shutdowns. This decreased order s received and sales for Services and MRO -driven business es during the second and third quarter s. The North American Market Area was particularly impacted in the second quarter , both by Covid -19 pandemic - related issues and oil price fluctuations , and market sentiment was generally subdued .

The decline in orders was due to slowdowns in Services and MRO -driven business es. Currency exchange rate changes had a negative impact of 4% in 1-9/2020 and a negative impact of 7% in 7-9/2020 on orders received . The o rder backlog as of September 30, 2020 was EUR 293 million ( September 30, 2019: EUR 295 million) .

Adjustment items of EUR 2 million had a negative impact on the operating profit in the third quarter (EUR 0 million). The adjustments were attributable to advisory, brand, IT and other costs related to the creation and rebranding of Neles as well as setting up a new operating structure. The o perating profit was EUR 19 million, or 13.5% of sales (EUR 27 million, or 16.0%). In the reporting period , January 1 - September 30, 2020, Neles adjusted EBITA amounted to EUR 62 million, or 14.8% of sales (EUR 78 million, or 15.9%). Profitability was negatively affected by a lower sales volume than J\u00ad65 Neles' Interim Report January - September 2020 the previous year , specifically in Services and MRO -driven business es. This was d ue to the slower than expected market recovery , and ongoing mobility restrictions and lockdowns related to the Covid -19 pandemic , as well as postponements of customers' maintenance shutdowns. To offset the negative volume impact on profitability, both permanent and temporary cost -saving actions were taken. Temporary cost -saving actions such as reduced work time continued during the third quarter . Most of the temporary savings actions ended on September 30. SG&A costs in the reporting period were lower compared to comparison period due to cost saving actions, lower business activity and reduced external spending. In the reporting period, adjustment items of EUR 8 million had a negative impact on operating profit (EUR 0 million) . Adjustment items in the third quarter amounted to EUR 2 million (EUR 0 million). The adjustments were attributable to advisory, brand, IT and other costs related to the creation and rebranding of Neles as well as setting up a new operating structure . The operating profit in the reporting period amounted to EUR 52 million, or 12.3% of sales (EUR 75 million, or 15.3%). In the third quarter, the operati ng profit amounted to EUR 19 million, or 13.5% (EUR 27 million, or 16 .0%). Adjustments will also continue in the fourth quarter .

Financial net expenses in the reporting period amounted to EUR 4 million (EUR 1 million) . Financial net expenses in the third quarter amounted to EUR 1 million (EUR 0 million) . The i ncrease was attributable to loan facilities allocated to Neles and other finance expenses related to funding arrangements at the time of the partial demerger .

The spread and severity of the pandemic continue to be difficult to predict. Abrupt measures taken by various national and local governments to restrict the spread of the virus have increased the unpredictability of the demand for Neles' prod ucts and services. The pandemic -related mobility restrictions have impacted Neles' operations by restricting Neles' ability to provide services at customer sites , as well as the running of manufacturing sites when lockdowns were imposed. These uncertaintie s are expected to continue in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, customers have return ed to more normalized operations compared to the second quarter , but large maintenance projects are still largely postpon ed due to mob ility restrictions and tightening cash management by customers. The situation has caused slow -down in Services and MRO -driven business es. Also, due to earlier shutdowns, there has been some deterioration in supplier delivery times during the third quarter. Thus far, Neles has experienced no material credit losses or cancelations of orders in the order backlog. There are also other market - and customer -related risks that could cause planned and on -going projects to be postponed, delayed or discontinu ed. Tightening trade relations, c ontinued market growth and inflation , as well as the impact of tariffs or other trade barriers could pose challenges to Neles' supply chain and price management, impacting the company's growth capability and margins. J\u00ad1110 Neles' Interim Report January - September 2020 Exchange rate fluctuations and changes in commodity prices could affect our orders received, sales and financial position. Neles hedges currency exposure linked to firm delivery and purchase agreements. Uncertain market conditions could adversel y affect our customers' payment behavior and increase the risk of lawsuits, claims and disputes taken against Neles in various countries related to Neles' products, projects and other operations , for example . Market outlook We expect the market activity in Pulp and Paper projects to continue at a good level. Market activity in Oil and Gas projects is expected to continue to decline from the good level in the first half of the year, due to general economic concerns. Postpone ments and global uncertainties are reducing visibility in the Oil and Gas project business. Market activity for Services and the customer Maintenance, Repair and Operations -driven (MRO) business es is expected to gradually improve from the suppressed levels during the reporting period , because customers' operations are resuming to a more normal level. Large shutdowns are still being postponed due to the Covid - 19 pandemic situation and customers' tig htening cash management actions. The ongoing Covid -19 pandemic continues to create uncertainties and risks of abrupt changes in all markets.

Fair value estimation For those financial assets and liabilities which have been recognized at fair value in the balance sheet, the following measurement hierarchy and valuation methods have been applied: Level 1 Quoted unadjusted prices at the balance sheet date in active markets. The market prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, market information service system, pricing service or regulatory agency. The quoted market price used for financial assets is the current bid price. Level 1 financial instruments include debt and equity investments classi fied as financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss. Level 2 The fair value of financial instruments in Level 2 is determined using valuation techniques. These techniques utilize observable market data readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, market information service system, pricing servic e or regulatory agency. Level 2 financial instruments include: Over -the-counter derivatives classified as financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit and loss or qualified for hedge accounting Debt securities classified as financial instrum ents at fair value through profit and loss Fixed rate debt under fair value hedge accounting Level 3 A financial instrument is categorized into Level 3 if the calculation of the fair value cannot be based on observable market data. Neles had no such instru ments. J\u00ad2524 Neles' Interim Report January - September 2020 The table below present Neles' financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value.
