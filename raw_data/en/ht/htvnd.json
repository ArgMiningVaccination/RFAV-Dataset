And since the 51-year-old star relapsed this past December, she has made it her mission to find a cure. On Friday she took to Instagram to share a snap of her latest experiment - hyperthermia therapy - writing: 'Fever is our body's natural way to fight disease......... Why are we taught to suppress it?' Scroll down for video 'Another day at the office' Yolanda Foster shared this photo on Friday, documenting her trial of hyperthermia treatment in her continued quest to find a cure for Lyme disease In the photo Yolanda wears a baby blue button down with the sleeves rolled up while laying in a large thermal chamber. She watched as a nurse attended to her, seemingly hooking her up to the machine used for hyperthermia - which is also a type of cancer treatment. In hyperthermia therapy - also called thermal therapy or thermotherapy - body tissue is exposed to high temperatures to damage and kill the damaged or cancerous cells, usually with minimal injury to normal tissues. Yolanda's short blonde hair is pulled into a top knot, and she is covered in blankets as she waits to begin the treatment. Along with the photo, Yolanda wrote: '[heart emoji] Fever is our body's natural way to fight disease......... Why are we taught to suppress it? #BackToBasics #HyperThermia #AnotherDayAtTheOffice #MyLymeJourney frequently takes to Instagram to document her journey for a cure, sharing snaps of her treatments. 'Rise up and attack' The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star traveled to Tijuana, Mexico at the beginning of the month to try an 'ancient medicine' in her search for the cure She took to her Bravo blog in January, explaining why she hadn't been able to write as often, and announcing her plan to tirelessly pursue a cure. 'I have lost the ability to read, write, or even watch TV, because I can't process information or any stimulation for that matter,' Yolanda began. 'The most frustrating thing is that there is medical data on Lyme and spirochete infections going back all the way to 1908, but yet we still don't have proper diagnostic testing, a vaccine, or a cure for Lyme disease while we are living in the United States of America, the most extraordinary country in the world.' She continued: 'Something doesn't add up here, and I will made it my life mission to figure this out, because nobody deserves to suffer this way in 2015.' Earlier this month Yolanda traveled to Tijuana, Mexico where she turned to an unconventional 'ancient medicine' for treatment. 'RISE UP AND ATTACK each day with courage,' she captioned an image of the therapy, adding, 'Thank you Mexico for being open to ancient medicine #Ozone #TijuanaMexico #SearchingForACure #ChronicLymeDisease.' Her hashtag of 'ozone' could be referencing the alternative medicine treatment in which oxygen is pumped into the body, a purported therapy for cancer and HIV, some medical professionals have claimed. The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills star is seen seated on a chair in a medical office with what appears to be an intravenous device in her forearm. A latex glove is by her side. Dressed in a ribbed coral sweater, white capri trousers, the blonde looks away from the camera as the device does its work. The TV personality recently revealed to Bravo that she has shared her knowledge on Lyme disease to help Avril Lavigne, who she quietly advised when the 30-year-old learned of her diagnosis. 'I took Avril under my wing when she first got sick and shared all I know,' Yolanda said, adding, 'I am so proud of her for going public.' The pop star hinted last year that she was suffering from an illness, but opened up about the disease in a People magazine cover story this month. Yolanda credits her husband David Foster for being her 'guiding light,' and her children - supermodel daughters Gigi and Bella Hadid, and son Anwar Hadid - for acting as 'shining stars' during her hard times. 'Sometimes I wonder how my spirit keeps going, but no matter how dark my days are, I always try to remember that there are people out there who have problems much bigger than mine and under much worse circumstances,' she shared on [Dr. Oz's](http://blog.doctoroz.com/oz-experts/yolanda-foster-on-her-battle-with-lyme-disease) website. [InTouch](http://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/yolanda-foster-s-medical-bills-exceed-500-000-as-rhobh-star-fights-lyme-disease-report-53292) magazine reports that her medical costs have so far exceeded $500,000, and her music mogul husband has spared no expense to support his wife's recovery. 'Yolanda travels first class, and the medical care is very, very expensive,' an insider revealed to the weekly. 'David has spent more than a half million dollars on medical care for Yolanda.' 'Guiding light' Yolanda credits her husband David Foster, and three children for helping her deal with her illness (pictured here with David in December 2014) Most watched News videos - [Animation shows how Leicester City owner's helicopter crashed](/video/uknews/video-3011535/Video-Animation-shows-Leicester-City-owners-helicopter-crashed.html?mwv_rm=rta) - [Inside look at Delta flight after passenger had diarrhea](/video/news/video-3011529/Inside-look-Delta-flight-passengers-diarrhea.html?mwv_rm=rta) - [Moment Ryanair chairman splattered with pies by Belgian eco-mob](/video/newsalerts/video-3012773/Video-Moment-Ryanair-chairman-splattered-pies-Belgian-eco-mob.html?mwv_rm=rta) - [Man pushed into sea by ferry crew while trying to leap onto vessel](/video/greece/video-3011733/Video-Man-pushed-sea-ferry-crew-trying-leap-vessel.html?mwv_rm=rta) - [Rishi Sunak's statement about prison escape of records helicopter](/video/russiaukraineconflict/video-3011761/Video-Ukrainian-troops-blasting-Russian-helicopter.html?mwv_rm=rta) - [Public catch 'watch thief' and pin him in Sloane Square](/video/crime/video-3012673/Video-Public-catch-watch-thief-pin-chair-Sloane-Square.html?mwv_rm=rta) - [Former detective: Fugitive ex-soldier may already have fled country](/video/crime/video-3012533/Video-Former-detective-Fugitive-ex-soldier-fled-country.html?mwv_rm=rta) - [William and Kate receive flowers from kids outside St Davids Cathedral](/video/katemiddleton/video-3013659/Video-William-Kate-receive-flowers-kids-outside-St-Davids-Cathedral.html?mwv_rm=rta) - [Mark Rowley says Daniel Khalife escape could have been an inside job](/video/crime/video-3013349/Video-Mark-Rowley-says-Daniel-Khalife-escape-inside-job.html?mwv_rm=rta) - [Heartbreaking footage of a dog stranded on a roof in Greece](/video/greece/video-3012727/Video-Heartbreaking-footage-dog-stranded-roof-Greece.html?mwv_rm=rta) The comments below have been moderated in advance.
