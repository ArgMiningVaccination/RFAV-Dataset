Not having a full com plement of Board m embers to respond to these findings and recom mendations, each issue is being addressed with the historic position of previous Boards. Once a quorum is reestablished, these issues will be forwarded to the Board for discussion, in the m eantim e, the following is the Board's response: Little Hoover Commissions - Finding & Recommendation 1 Finding 1: While the legal scope of practice clearly defines the m odalities that acupuncturists can use, the statute is silent on issues that are im portant in defining their role as health care providers. Recommendation 1: The Governor and the Legislature should clarify in statute the role of acupuncturists in the health care system . Specifically the statute should: (1) Keep licensure focused on traditional Oriental m edicine (TOM); (2) Define prim ary care practitioner; (3) Authorize and define traditional Oriental diagnosis; (4) Require disclosure of critical inform ation; and (5) Allow for acupuncture-only licensure. Board's Response: (1) Keep licensure focused on traditional Oriental medicine : The Board agrees and feels the scope of practice and educational curriculum requirements are focused on TOM and are clearly defined in the law s and regulations that regulate an acupuncture and Oriental medicine practitioner. The educational curriculum requirements provide the licensee w ith the foundation to practice w ithin their defined scope of practice. The Board addresses this issue on Pages 18 and 19 of the Board's 2004 Sunset Review Report. B&P Code sect ions 4927 and 4937, in conjunction w ith Legal Opinion 93-11, prepared by Board's legal counsel in 1993, defines acupuncture and the w ide range of modalities to treat most common disorders and diseases . The Board believes that the current scope of practice for a practitioner of acupuncture and Oriental medicine is adequate and is not lobbying to have it expanded. The legislative intent in B&P Code Section 4926 defines an acupuncturist as individuals practicing acupuncture subject to regulation and control as a primary health care profession. B&P Code Section 4927(d) defi nes acupuncture to mean \"the stimulation of certain point or points on or near the surface of the body by the insertion of needles to prevent or modify the perception of pain or to normaliz e physiological functions, including pain control, for the treatment of certain diseases or dysfunctions of the body and includes the techniques of el ectroacupuncture, cupping and moxibustion.\" B&P turist to utiliz e Oriental medicine treatment modalities and procedures used to promote, maintain, and restore health; including the use of Oriental massage, acupressure, breathing techniques, exercise, heat, cold, magnets, nutrition, diet, herbs, plant, animal, and mineral products, and dietary supplements. Acupuncturists w ere included as primary treating physicians in the Workers Compensation system in 1989 and approved as a Qualified Medical Evaluator (QME)(Labor Code Section 3209.3(a)). Since the elimination of requiring a physician referral in 1979, an acupuncturist's scope of practice has expanded to include diagnosis. Thus an acupuncturist is allow ed to diagnose, prescribe and administer treatment in the practice of acupuncture and Oriental medicine. (2) Define primary care practitioner : 'Primary health care' is a universal term among health care practitioners. Primary health care - means a licensed health care provider w ho provides initial health care services to a patient and w ho, within the scope of their license, is responsible for initial diagnosis and treatment, health supervision, preventative health services, and referral to other health care providers when specializ ed care is indicated. As a primary health care professional an acupuncturist may provide comprehensive, rout ine and preventative treatments, that includes but is not limited to, TCM diagnosis, palliative, therapeutic and rehabilitative care. Page 18 of the LHC's September 2004 report lists a compilation of definitions for the term of primary care provider. Patients have direct access to either a Western or Eastern practitioner and each of these definitions and responsibilities w ould apply to either practitioner. This is further recogniz ed by the LHC in their September 2004 report, w herein on Page ii of the Executive Summary, they state \"clear statutory language is needed to affirm that consumers have 'direct access' to acupuncturists w ho can diagnose patients using traditional Oriental techniques....\". (3) Authoriz e and define traditional Oriental diagnosis : The Board agrees and addresses this issue on Page 19 of the Board's September 2004 Sunset Review Report, and provided proposed language to the Joi nt Committee to amend B&P Code Section 4937 adding the term 'diagnose' to the language. Legal Opinion 93-11 found that the Legislature in repealing B&P Code Section 2155 (i.e., eliminating the need for a physician referral as a precondition for treatment by an acupuncturist) (Statutes of 1979, Chapter 488, effective January 1, 1980) authoriz ed acupuncturists to diagnose a patient's condition prior to providing any treatment. Thus, although an acupuncturist is authoriz ed to diagnose, this critical function w as inadvertently omitted and 2therefore is not clearly stated in the law . Since 1980 acupuncturists have been authoriz ed to diagnose and treat w ithin their scope and in their daily practice as 'initial contact health care providers'. Amending Section 4937 w ould accurately reflect the current authority, scope and practice. On a daily basis acupuncturists assess and diagnose patients to provide an effective and quality treatment plan. This w as recogniz ed in 2002 by the Joint Sunset Review Committee and the Department of Consumer Affairs in the w ritten comments reported in their final recommendations regarding Issue No. 1, relating to continuance of regulating the profession, w herein they stated, \"Acupuncturi sts diagnose, administer treatment, and prescribe various treatments and herbs to promote patient health.\" This is further recogniz ed by the LHC in their September 2004 report, w herein on Page ii of the Executive Summary, they state \"clear statutory language is needed to affirm that consumers have direct access to acupuncturists w ho can diagnose patients using traditional Oriental medicine t echniques....\", and again on Page v in Recommendation 1, w herein they state, \"the scope of practice should include an explicit authoriz ation to conduct traditional Oriental medicine diagnosis\". (4) Require disclosure of critical information : The Board agrees w ith the LHC's recommendation. As the integration of Eastern and Western medicine continues to expand the Eastern practitioner should be required to offer information regarding Western interaction -and- the Western pr actitioner should offer information on complementary medicines, including acupunc ture. The DHS/FDA has jurisdiction for approving devices. How ever, the Board acknow ledges the LHC's recommendation to regulate single-use disposable needles and w ill amend current regulations to conform w ith the FDA rules. The Board concurs that acupuncture needles should alw ays follow FDA regulations. Single-use disposable needles are already the norm and have not been an issue. The 1996 Occupational Analysis reflected that 99.6% (99.3% English, 100% Chinese and 100% Korean) of licensees 'only' used disposable needles in their practice and few consumer complaints have been filed w ith the Board involving multiple use needles. June 1996 FDA rules have required manufacturers to label their acupuncture needles for 'single use only', and historically, students are taught this in their theoretical and practical training. The Board has been responsive to the consumer by ensuring strict education requirements on clean needle technique (CNT) and testing the exam applicant on CNT protocol. The Board also enforces state and federal law s relating to standards of care, steriliz ation, and condition of office (i.e., OSHA, CNT, Haz ardous Waste, Health and Safety Codes, etc.). The Board's 2004 revised consumer brochure, released June 2004, also contains language addressing single use needles (page 8) and herb-drug interactions (page 10). (5) Allow for acupuncture-only licensure : Not having a full complement of Board members this issue is being addressed w ith the historic position of previous Boards. Once a quorum is re-established, this issue w ill be forw arded to them for discussion. In the past, the Board has taken action to oppose this type of proposal. The Board has alw ays felt, w hile there are different modalities utiliz ed to treat specific conditions and vary depending upon the needs of the patient, that acupuncture and Oriental medicine is one medicine and should be le arned as one medicine. Once learned it is the discretion of the practitioner to utiliz e the application of the full complement of 3modalities making up the medicine or specializ e in selected portions thereof. Issuing licenses that only focus on one of the moda lities of the medicine could actually be more confusing to the public, and contradicts the fundamental premise of an acupuncturist treating the w hole being utiliz ing all the modalities of acupuncture and Oriental medicine. Rather than implemen ting a new licensing structure it w ould perhaps be more efficient to solicit underut ilized practitioners to address the needs for drug and alcohol addiction treatments in California. Little Hoover Commissions - Finding & Recommendation 2 Finding 2: The new 3,000-hour educational requirem ent is adequate to prepare entry-level practitioners and to protect the public safety. Recommendation 2: The num ber of educational hours should not be increased, and should be focused on traditional Oriental healing practices w ithin a m odern fram ework for patient safety. Specifically, the Acupuncture Board should im plem ent the following policies: (1) Educate within scope; (2) Devote adequate curriculum to patient safety, including coordination (i.e., up-to-date infection control practices; im proving coordination with W estern m edicine); and (3) Teach within area of expertise. Board's Response: (1) Educate w ithin scope : The Board addresses this issue on Pages 20 and 21 of the Board's 2004 Sunset Review Report. The Board feels the scope of practice and educational curriculum requirements are focused on TOM and are clearly defined in the law s and regulations that regulate an acupuncture and Oriental medicine practitioner. The educational curriculum pr ovides the licensee w ith the foundation to practice w ithin their defined scope of prac tice. Since the commencement of licensure in California in 1975 health care and related technology have changed tremendously. The current level of education (i.e., 2,348-hours) has not kept pace w ith the expanded roll of a primary health care practitioner. It is the responsibility of the Board to maintain an adequate level of educational requirements that match the entry-level know ledge, skills and abilities required of a licensed practitioner in California today. B&P Code Section 4939(b) requires a mi nimum 3,000-hour curriculum requirement, effective January 1, 2005. The Board's goal is to ensure an acupuncturist possesses a level of education that is consistent w ith levels of education for other primary health care professions in the United States. China, Korea and Taiw an have established international education standards for their he alth care professions. The profession of acupuncture and Oriental medicine must be able to adapt its educational standards to the ever-changing dynamics of science and technology applicable to the practice. With the increased use of acupuncture, the need for a common language to facilitate communication in teaching, research, clinical practice and exchange of information had become pressing, therefore in 1989, the World Health Organiz ation (WHO) convened a Scientific Group w hich approved a 'Standard International Acupuncture Nomenclature' w hich is being w idely disseminated and applied. The Scientific Group also recommended that the organiz ation develop a series of statements and guidelines in acupuncture relating to basic training, safe ty in clinical practice, indications and contraindications, and clinical research. According to WHO's guidelines on basic training and safety in acupuncture, released in 1995, a minimum of 2,500 hours is considered the minimal standard for the student of 'acupuncture' alone, not including 4the 450-650 hours for training in herbal medicine. Of the 2,500 hours, 500 hours are recommended for the study of Western medicine. The standards released by WHO are intended to assist national health authorities in setting standards and establishing official examinations, and also medical sch ools and institutions to define training programs. In the past the Board has supported an eventual entry-level standard of 4,000 hours commensurate w ith the profession's status as a primary health care professional and in alignment w ith international accepted st andards. How ever, before the Board ever took action to proceed w ith any further increases in the educational requirements, it would need to evaluate the educational outcomes and practice proficiencies of licensees trained at the 3,000-hour level. (2) Devote adequate curriculum to patient safety, including coordination (i.e., up-to- date infection control practices; improving coordination w ith Western medicine) : The Board agrees and its main objective is to set a standard that protects the consumer and assures a level of education that is consistent w ith all other first-contact health care professionals w ho provide comprehensive and routine care. All medical practitioners need a core medical curriculu m leading to basic medical understanding and an aw areness of the strengths and w eaknesses of other modalities to know when to refer and how best to communicate w ith other practitioners. It is in the patient's best interest that all medical practitioners possess common core know ledge of medical terminology and know ledge to promote good professional communication, patient case management, and continuity of care. All health care professionals must keep up with constant changes and improvements in modern science and medicine. Acupuncturists, as w ell as all providers listed in the California Labor Code Section 3209.3 as 'physicians', are required to complete accurate, uniform, and replicable evaluations. The procedures require an evalua tion of anatomical loss, functional loss, and the presence of physical complaints to be supported, to the extent feasible, by medical findings based on standardiz ed examinations and testing techniques generally accepted by the medical community. The Board feels the scope of practice and educational requirements are primarily focused on TOM and are clearly defined in the law s and regulations that regulate an acupuncture and Oriental medicine practitioner. The Board also feels a licensee should have a core education and know ledge of the biomedical sciences as currently taught in school. Know ing how to establish a w orking diagnosis, w hen to refer, and how to communicate and interact with Western trained practitioners ensures the health, safety and protection of the consumer. (3) Teach w ithin area of expertise : The Board agrees that the basic science courses could be taken outside of their acupuncture and Oriental medicine (AOM) educational program and the majority of the new enrolling students enter their AOM program already having taken these courses. This w ould 'free-up' the program hours designated to the basic sciences to be utiliz ed in other critical educational program components. CCR Section 1399.436(i) requires that \"all instructors shall be competent to teach their designated courses by virtue of their education, training and experience\", therefore instructors of both TOM and biomedical courses teach w ithin their area of expertise. 5Little Hoover Commissions - Finding & Recommendation 3 Finding 3: The steadily increasing educational requirem ents for new entrants into the acupuncture profession potentially creates different levels of com petency, and could confuse or mislead the public regarding the knowledge, skills and ability of those previously licensed. Recommendation 3: The Governor and the Legislature should reallocate - and consider increasing the num ber of - continuing education hours required of currently licensed practitioners as a m echanism to update patient safety requirem ents. The law should: (1) Specify courses (to keep practitioners current on certain conditions and procedures); and (2) Require exam ination (require testing for m aterial related to patient safety). Board's Response : (1) Specify courses (to keep practitioners current on certain conditions/procedures) : The Board agrees and already took action to specify courses in the proposed regulatory changes in Attachment M of the Board's 2004 Sunset Review Report. The proposed regulatory changes w ill require a mandatory 4 hours in drug/herb interaction as a condition of renew al every tw o years. The proposed regulatory changes also specifies categories that continuing education courses must fall w ithin and limits the number of hours a licensee can take on courses not directly related to acupuncture and Oriental medicine, Western medicine as it relates to acupuncture practice, and scope of practice. Enforcement complaints do not reflect this is an issue, however the proposed regulations could be amended to include or define specific courses recommended by the Commission. Once a quorum of the Board is reestablished this issue w ill be forw arded to them for discussion. (2) Require examination (require testing for material related to patient safety) : Patient safety is a primary focus in the daily theoretical and practical training of an acupuncture student and is included on the li censing exam that a candidate must pass prior to licensure. Patient safety is also a fundamental part of a licensee's daily practice. The Board has addressed patient safety, new requirements and standards and other health issues in its annual new sletter to the licensees and through its website. While the Board has addressed th is issue and the low enforcement statistics relating to safety issues reflect this, there w ill alw ays be more that any entity can do and the Board is open to suggestions. The Board does not have a method of re- examining its licensees, nor does it concur that there is a need to do so. Re-examining its licensees is not a practice of licensing professions in California. Little Hoover Commissions - Finding & Recommendation 4 Finding 4: The exam ination of candidates f or licensure is a critical quality control m easure f or assuring com petency of providers and is an essential m echanism for ensuring that evolving public policy goals are m et. Recommendation 4: The California Acupuncture Board should continue to control its exam ination to ensure that the State' s policy goals are m et. Am ong the policy goals that the State should ensure: (1) Dem onstrate knowledge of critical com ponents of safe practice (m ust-pass m odules); (2) Com petitive exam ination adm inistration (continue to contract out); (3) Develop strategy for im plem enting internship. 6Board's Response : (1) Demonstrate know ledge of critical components of safe practice (must-pass modules) : Historically a candidate 'must-pass' the entire licensing examination. The examination covers five content areas that reflect the current job competencies in the practice of acupuncture and Oriental medicine in California. The five content areas and their associated w eights include (1) Patient Assessment (25% ); (2) Developing a Diagnostic Impression (20% ); (3) Providing Acupuncture Treatment (29% ); (4) Prescribing Herbal Medicinals (17% ), and (5) Regulations for Public Health and Safety (9% ). A module testing for law s, regulations, scope of practice and safety standards has been discussed with the Board and the DCA Office of Examination Resources (OER) since 1999 w hen the practical component of the exam w as eliminated. The Board is also concerned that only nine percent of the current licensing exam tests for all these subjects. How ever, discussion and decisions of modifications to the exam since the 2001 sunset review process, had been suspended until the issue of w ho will conduct the exam w as resolved. Based on the Board's historic position and confirmed in th e LHC's findings and recommendations, it appears California w ill retain the developmen t and administration of the licensing exam. The Board and OER can now strategiz e a way to enhance the exam w ith the components of the eliminated practical (i.e ., point location, herb identification/usage, CNT, diagnosis) and a 'must-pass' module. (2) Competitive examination administration (continue to contract out) : The Board agrees w ith the LHC's findings and recommendation on this issue and w ill continue to contract out. (3) Develop strategy for implementing internship : The Board agrees w ith the LHC's findings and recommendations on this issue. The Board also has discussed and supported the issue of requiring post-graduation, pre-examination clinical internships, how ever the Board has not been able to follow through on this as the same opportunities for a fully integrated clinic or hospital environment for acupuncturists has not existed in the past. Acupuncture and Oriental medicine is relatively new in California w ith only thirty years of licensure, how ever w ith the speed in w hich the medicine is being integr ated into the Western health care system, opportunities for implementing internships have increased over the last few years and the Board is confident internships w ill beco me a reality in the near future. Several acupuncture schools have also established v ery successful externships in integrated clinics as part of the student's clinical requirements for graduation. Little Hoover Commissions - Finding & Recommendation 5 Finding 5: The process used by the Accreditation Com mission of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine appears to be superior to the school approval process used by the Acupuncture Board and could be used by the State to ensure the quality of education f or potential licensees. Recommendation 5: California should rely on ACAOM to accredit acupuncture schools, and other institutions for accreditation that are recognized by the Secretary of Education, while developing a m echanism to ensure that state-specific curriculum standards are m et. To achieve that goal policy-m akers have two options: (1) Contract with ACAOM; and (2) Require schools to docum ent. 7 Board's Response: The Board is opposed to naming any specific accrediting agency in law . If required, the legislative language should remain gen eric to recogniz e any school accredited by an accrediting agency approved by the U.S. Department of Education. The Board addresses this issue on Pages 34 through 36 of the Board's 2004 Sunset Review Report. In 2001, the Board began to focus on review ing and evaluating the school approval process. Public meetings w ere held to review the application and Board's site visit manual, policies and regulatio ns relating to school approval, BPPVE's approval process and the Accreditation Commission of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine's (ACAOM) accreditation process. In addition, BPPVE and ACAOM made presentations about their approval processes and how California could utiliz e or partner with them. ACAOM's didactic a nd clinical training program hour requirements have historically been w ell below that of California's. The Board is monitoring several accusations that surfaced in June 2004 against ACAOM of professional and ethical misconduct, w hich w as raised by three ACAOM commissioners w ho were removed from the Commission. Also in June ACAOM had undergone organiz ational restructuring w ith the deletion of the long-standing director and office in Southern California. In May 2002, a new accrediting agency w as incorporated and began the process to become recogniz ed by the U.S. Department of Education. The National Oriental Medicine Accreditation Agency (NOMAA) w ill accredit acupuncture schools offering a professional Doctor of Oriental Medicine (DOM) degree. South Baylo University in Los Angeles in June 2004 launched the first NOMAA Doctor of Oriental Medicine degree program in the state. The Board w ill continue monitoring the progress of the program. Accreditation is not a replacement for governme ntal regulation. Public institutions receive their approval to operate through the state Constitution and legislative action. Accreditation is a voluntary, private-sector evaluation. Accrediting bodies cannot force institutions to comply w ith state and federal law s, and do not view their role as regulatory. There are three types of accrediting bodies, regional associations (e.g., the Western Association of Schools and Colleges [WASC]); national accrediting bodies (e.g., the Association of Independent Colleges and Schools, the National Association of trade and Technical Schools); and specializ ed accrediting bodies (e.g., ACAOM, NOMAA, American Bar Association, National Education Association). The Board is opposed to naming any specific accrediting agency in law . If required, the legislative language should remain generic to recogniz e any school accredited by an accrediting agency approved by the U.S. Department of Education. National scope, practice or educational standards \"do not\" exist in this profession, which is largely due to the variance in the scope of practice from state to state. The spectrum is w ide and diverse. For instance, 11 states do not license acupuncture and Oriental medicine practitioners, others still require a referral from an allopathic doctor, and some states have a limited scope of practice, w hile the profession in California has a broader scope. Therefore, at the June 2002 and again at the September 23, 2003 Board meeting the members took a position to retain the Board's school approval process as a requirement for a graduate student to qualify for the CALE. Recogniz ing other approval or accrediting authorities may limit or 8compromise the Board's ability to improve educational and approval standards. Little Hoover Commissions - Finding & Recommendation 6 Finding 6: The California Acupuncture Board has m issed significant opportunities to protect the public, particularly in the areas of consum er protection and herb-related safety. Recommendation 6: The Governor and the Legislature, through the Sunset Review process or other m echanism , should ensure that the California Acupuncture Board becom es a strong advocate for consum ers. Am ong the steps that should be taken: (1) The board needs to develop a patient safety strategy; (2) Develop consum er protections for herb products; and (3) Restructure the regulator to benefit consum ers (public m ember majority). Board's Response: (1) The board needs to develop a patient safety strategy : As stated above in #4 of Recommendation 1, the Board acknow ledges LHC's recommendation to regulate single-use disposable needles and w ill amend current regulations to conform w ith the FDA rules. The Board w ould like to restate its concurrence that acupuncture needles should alw ays follow FDA regulations. Single-use needles are already the norm and have not been an issue w ith the Board. The 1996 Occupational Analysis reflected that 99.6% (99.3% English, 100% Chinese and 100% Korean) of licensees 'only' used disposable needles in their practice and few consumer complaints have been filed w ith the Board involving multiple use needles. June 1996 FDA rules have required manufacturers to label their acupuncture needles for 'single use only', and historically students are taught this in their theoretical and practical training. The Board has been responsive to the consumer by ensuring strict education requirements on clean needle technique (CNT) and testing the exam applicant on CNT protocol. The Board also enforces state and federal law s relating to standards of care, steriliz ation, condition of office (i.e., OSHA, CNT, Haz ardous Waste, Health and Safety Codes, etc.). The Board's 2004 revised consumer brochure, released June 2004 , also contains language addressing single use needles (page 8), in addition to herb-drug interactions and a caution to keep both a physician and acupuncturist apprised of all products a patient is taking (page 10). The Board's consumer brochure further addresses the research findings from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) on page 6. In addition, the proposed regulatory chan ges in Attachment M of the Board's 2004 Sunset Review Report w ill require a mandatory 4 hours in drug/herb interaction as a condition of renew al every tw o years. The proposed regulatory changes also specifies categories that continuing education courses must fall w ithin and limits the number of hours a licensee can take in courses not directly related to acupuncture and Oriental medicine, Western medicine as it relat es to acupuncture practice, and scope of practice. Enforcement complaints do not reflect this is an issue, how ever the proposed regulations could be amended to include or define specific courses recommended by the LHC. Once a quorum of the Board is reestablished this issue will be forw arded to them for discussion. (2) Develop consumer protections for herb products : The Board recogniz es and agrees w ith the LHC regarding the concerns and 9importance of herb-drug interactions, herb purity and potency, accurate labeling, and reporting of adverse effects. 'Regulating herbs' w as a primary issue in the Board's 1997, 1998 and 1999/2000 Strategic Plans. The Board discussed this issue for the first time at a public meeting on September 28, 1997, and again on February 23, 1998, May 28, 1998, February 23, 1999 and concluded June 27, 2000. In 1997 the Board felt that in order to protect consumers against the potential danger of medicinal-grade herbs it w as essential to review the need to regulate the distribution, sale and/or use of herbs in California. During that time, the Board assisted the California State Food and Drug Branch of the Department of Health Services (DHS), the state agency having authority over herbs and herbal products, to identify Asian patent medicines for the 1997-1998 Compendium of Asian Patent Medicines. This publication w as compiled to educate the public, herbal industry and medical community on the potential danger of some of the patent medicines. Dr. Richard Ko, DHS Division of Food and Drug, testified numerous time before the Board, but specifically on September 28, 1997, February 23, 1998, and May 28, 1998 regarding herbal regulation. At the February 23, 1999 meeting, the Board's legal counsel cautioned the members about carrying this issue any further, advising that the Board has no legal authority to regulate herbs, as herbs are not regulated by anyone. He also cautioned that the coalitions of dietary herb companies and pharmaceutical companies are far too strong for this Board to take on in this highly sensitive and political battle and should be left up the state agency (DHS) w ith the authority to do so. The Board feels very confident that in California, acupuncturists are the only licensed health care professionals required to be trained and tested for competency in prescribing herbal medicine. California approved acupuncture schools offer a minimum of 450 classroom hours of instruction in traditional Oriental herbology in addition to clinic al training. Chinese herbal medicine has been practiced safely and effectively for centuries and has the greatest potential for beneficial results w hen prescribed by a trained professional w ho recogniz es the benefits and risks. In recent years, herbs have become very popular to self-treat many conditions. They are available in health food stores, supermarkets and on the Internet. While herbs are promoted as safe, inexpensive 'natural' alternatives to pharmaceutical drugs, the Board has concerns about safety, purity, strength, effectiveness, potential misuse of herbal products, and standardiz ation of herbs, especially w hen self-prescribed. (4) Restructure the regulator to benefit consumers : Long standing law s have been in place governing DCA boards or bureaus that designate the number and composition of the board structure as w ell as designating the appointing source. It has been the policy of the legislature to require a public majority on licensing boards for all professions excepting the health care boards, w herein the statutes designate a professional majority. Any changes to these law s and policies w ill need to originate through the Governor's office and the legislature. The Board appreciates the opportunity to respond to the Joint Com mittee's questions and would be happy to provide any additional inform ation as requested. 10 Sincerely, Marilyn Nielsen Executive Officer Cc: Charlene Zettel, Director, DCA Hattie Hanley, Project Manager, Little Hoover Com mission 11 "}
