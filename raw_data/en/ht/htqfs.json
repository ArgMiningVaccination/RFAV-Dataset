My night sweats were so bad I was barely managing to sleep more than 3 to 4 hours a night. I would wake up covered in sweat and no matter how many fans I had pointed my way I still felt like I was burning from the inside out. Then I came across Andrea's TikTock live. She was telling my story and she offered hope. I ordered Dim and Pygnaltin (sorry for the misspelling) and within a few days I noticed relief! I actually slept through the night. I didn't drench my sheets. My night sweats were decreasing in intensity and I was able to get some rest. I also take a tablet in the morning and noticed my hot flashes are more manageable.
