It only makes sense that the palliation and cure to our ailments can be found in the natural world surrounding us! Historically, the healing properties of plants have been discovered through clinical observation and personal antidotes compiled over thousands of years. Modern day herbal research has added additional insight as we now understand more about individual compounds contained within the plants. We also standardize herbal medicines so we know exactly what is contained in the herbal product prescribed. Herbal medicine is highly effective and very safe, with few documented side-effects and potential interactions. Herbal medicine is one of our favorite treatment modalities because, not only are leaves, roots, berries and flowers some of the most powerful medicines we have, they also have the ability to work on many levels at once-the mental, emotional and physical.
