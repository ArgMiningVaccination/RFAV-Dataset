Through a whole-person approach, students learn to use science and evidence-based research to provide patient care alongside other disciplines, including SCU's Chiropractic and Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine programs. Physician Assistants are in high demand and enjoy careers that are rewarding both personally and professionally. U.S. News & World Report ranked Physician Assistant among the top five Best Jobs overall and [#2 in Best Health Care Jobs](https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/physician-assistant) [.](https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/physician-assistant) SCU's model of experiential learning in [interprofessional settings ](https://www.scuhs.edu/interprofessional-education/)combines learning alongside other healthcare disciplines, coursework, clinical experiences, community engagement, and campus activities and clubs that introduce students to a variety of philosophies, practices, and treatment options; help students develop a broad base of knowledge; and prepare future healthcare professionals with a deep understanding of integrative, evidence- and team-based, whole-person healthcare. Education at SCU is supplemented by advanced anatomical teaching tools. All learning technologies are available on site, and many are also accessible at home. SCU offers convenient access to anatomy educational materials outside of normal classroom hours. Advanced learning technologies include: Our practitioner faculty bring timely experience to the classroom every day, supplementing their lectures with practical advice. Discover real-world insights from faculty who currently practice, and who are deeply connected to the field beyond a theoretical and academic perspective. At the intersection of two worlds, our practitioner faculty help guide your first steps into the world of practice, paving the way for a more gentle and gradual transition from student to professional. Healthcare that improves outcomes and lowers costs takes a team effort. A first-of-its-kind program, SCU's Master of Science: Physician Assistant Program is the first to offer PA students the opportunity to learn alongside other healthcare disciplines. You will be introduced to a variety of philosophies, practices, and treatment options for integrative, whole-person healthcare. Cadaver-based anatomy is a classic teaching method that offers invaluable lessons and insight into the shape, feel, and function of the body. During this unique experience for future Physician Assistants, students express reverence and awe as they approach the body to make their first cut in real tissues and structures. The cadaver lab offers unparalleled insight into anatomical variation, structure, and function to help you become an outstanding provider. SCU develops leaders to be thoughtful and compassionate practitioners who are qualified to provide high-quality care to a diverse population. The SCU Health System provides care to over 45,000 patients per year. The University Heath Center is equipped with an expansive herbal pharmacy, diagnostic imaging, and an electronic health record system. PA students train at a modern health center with an enriched teaching environment. You will interact with other health professions and disciplines and learn how to co-manage patients in an integrated setting within an interdisciplinary team environment. All PA students complete core clinical rotations in Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Family Medicine, Women's Health (Obstetrics and Gynecology), General Surgery, Behavioral Medicine, Emergency Medicine, and Integrative Medicine. Learn more about each [rotation.](https://www.scuhs.edu/masters-degrees/physician-assistant-program/?activetab=content_curriculum) PA students also choose two elective rotations. Elective rotation choices include Cardiothoracic Surgery, Endocrinology, Interventional Radiology, Pediatric Allergy/Immunology, Critical Care, and Urgent Care. Our program will prepare students to participate in integrative healthcare teams and deliver healthcare with a primary care focus to a diverse population by providing evidence-based instruction. Faculty, students, and graduates will be recognized as innovative leaders, incorporating integrative modalities into patient-centered healthcare. For more information about progress toward achieving program goals, visit our [Program Goals document](https://www.scuhs.edu/wp-content/uploads/Program-Goals-7.30.23.pdf). Physician Assistants (PAs) are healthcare providers who are nationally certified and state-licensed to practice medicine and prescribe medication in every medical and surgical specialty and setting. PAs practice and prescribe in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and all U.S. territories. PAs are educated at the graduate level, with most PAs receiving a master's degree or higher. Physician Assistants (PAs) are academically and clinically prepared to practice medicine on collaborative medical teams. The collaborative medical team is fundamental to the PA profession and enhances the delivery of high-quality health care. Within the collaborative medical team, PAs are medical professionals who diagnose illness, develop and manage treatment plans, prescribe medications, and often serve as a patient's principal healthcare provider. The role of the PA demands intelligence, sound judgment, intellectual honesty, appropriate interpersonal skills, and the capacity to respond to emergencies in a calm and reasoned manner. Essential attributes of the graduate PA include an attitude of respect for self and others, adherence to the concepts of privilege and confidentiality in communicating with patients, and a commitment to the patient's welfare. With thousands of hours of medical training, PAs are versatile and collaborative. PAs practice in every state and in every medical setting and specialty, improving healthcare access and quality. The clinical role of PAs includes primary and specialty care in medical and surgical practice settings. PAs may also work in the areas of medical education, health administration, and research. *Portions of the above text are taken from Accreditation Standards for Physician Assistant Education, Fifth Edition, ARC-PA, page 3, 2019. SCU's MSPA Program offers a flexible learning experience that combines online interactive and on-campus learning. During the didactic portion of the program, students can participate in online interactive instruction from the comfort of their homes, with only 1-2 days per week dedicated to on-campus labs. This allows students to save on travel time and provides the convenience of studying from home while still benefiting from hands-on learning opportunities on campus. Once students transition to the clinical year, all learning is conducted in person for clinical rotations. The MSPA Program is dedicated to participating in service opportunities. With the assistance of our PA Student Society representatives and leadership, our students are encouraged to provide service in the community, participate in health fairs, volunteer time to pre-PA student clubs, and provide outreach alongside other healthcare workers, with a focus in underserved areas. Our faculty members actively support our students in this effort, as we believe that service is a vital part of promoting our mission here at SCU. The MSPA Professionalism Honors Program acknowledges motivated students who maintain professionalism honors status throughout the duration of the program. If accomplished, upon graduation the student will be awarded a letter of acknowledgement from the Program Director which can be presented to a prospective employer as evidence of that student's dedication and regard for professionalism in medicine. SCU's MSPA Program is unique in that we offer a PANCE Preparedness Program. Each student receives a customized report of strengths and areas in need of improvement, a personal study plan, one-on-one tutoring and mentorship up to the date of their exam. This program extends even after graduation and is one of the many ways we support our students! SCU's Master of Science: Physician Assistant Program will prepare students to participate in integrative healthcare teams and deliver healthcare with a primary care focus to a diverse population by providing evidence-based instruction.

Students should refer to the information below and contact the appropriate licensing board to ensure they will meet the licensure requirements in the state(s) in which they intend to practice upon graduation. Upon completing an Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant (ARC-PA) accredited program, graduates are eligible to sit for the professional board exam given by the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants (NCCPA). Upon passing the exam, candidates are given the designation of Physician Assistant-Certified (PA-C). The candidate may then apply for state licensure and for a Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) certificate to prescribe controlled medication. SCU's Master of Science: Physician Assistant (MSPA) Program meets the educational requirements for licensure in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Some states have requirements in addition to educational requirements - prospective and enrolled students are encouraged to research licensure requirements for the state that they intend to practice in. These licensure requirements vary from state to state. Neither acceptance for admission into the program nor the subsequent earning of a Master of Science: Physician Assistant (MSPA) degree guarantees that a state or foreign country will grant a graduate a license to practice. Each state and foreign country, through its legislative and administrative process, defines the standards of competency and scope of practice of Physician Assistants within its jurisdiction. The American Academy of Physician Associates (AAPA) maintains a list of licensing boards at their [website.](https://www.aapa.org/advocacy-central/state-advocacy/state-licensing/list-of-licensing-boards/) Please note that licensure requirements are always subject to change. Although Southern California University of Health Sciences (SCU) will confirm the licensure requirements on a routine basis, we strongly recommend that you inquire with the licensing agency to confirm that you understand and will meet the requirements for licensure before enrolling in your program of choice. Additionally, while progressing through the program, we recommend that you check licensing agency requirements regularly to monitor whether they have changed in a manner that impacts your licensure plans. Upon program completion and successfully passing the Physician Assistant National Certifying Examination (PANCE), students are eligible to apply for licensure in their desired state. Licensing requirements vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may require a background check and/or other additional steps. Information about state-specific licensing requirements can be found on the [American Academy of Physician Associates' (AAPA) website.](https://www.aapa.org/advocacy-central/state-advocacy/state-licensing/) To practice medicine within the designated scope of practice and have services reimbursed by third-party payors, graduates may be required to have the following: The main reason I chose to come here for PA school was the excellent staff and faculty. They were all lovely, helpful, and welcoming during the admissions process, including my interview. Once I stepped on campus, I felt like I was finally home. Getting that phone call that I was admitted to SCU was truly the best day of my life. I have completed my first year of school, and that feeling has not faded. Our cohort is very close with the faculty and staff, who are always available for help. I do not doubt that they are thoroughly preparing us for the PANCE exam and to be excellent providers. I chose SCU when looking for a PA program because of their Integrative Medicine approach. I am from Michigan, and not many programs focus on this Integrative, Holistic approach when it comes to patient care in the Midwest, and I felt that was very important for me to learn as a future provider. My transition to semi-virtual learning has been very smooth and quite enjoyable. My favorite part about attending SCU is how tight-knit and diverse the community is. Coming from a large undergrad university and moving so far, it was very important for me to have a PA program that made me feel valued and invested in my success. At SCU, they do a great job of making you feel that.

Licensed Physician Assistants (PAs) can choose to work in private practices, hospitals, outpatient clinics, surgical centers, community health centers, nursing homes, and mental health facilities. PAs can also choose to work in non-clinical roles, such as in administrative, educational, and research settings. Some PAs decide to work as patient care providers for the military. PAs can build unique career trajectories around their interests and professional preferences. Some work in family medicine or acute care, while others work in oncology, pediatrics, radiology or even surgery, where they assist during procedures and provide post-surgical care. PAs can transition between specialty areas of medicine. According to the [Association of American Medical Colleges](https://news.aamc.org/press-releases/article/workforce_report_shortage_04112018/), the U.S. may face a shortage of over 120,000 physicians by 2032. PAs may help bridge the gap as [one of the fastest growing professions in the country](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/fastest-growing.htm) [.

The PA pathway offers great versatility in your career. While each specialty has distinct practice guidelines, PAs are qualified to work in all of them when licensed. PAs are not required to recertify in order to change specialties or work in new settings. This means you can launch a career you love and then pivot if you discover a new area of interest. You might go from Emergency Medicine, for example, to Family Practice. PAs have a measurable impact on patients and health systems. Physician Assistants play a crucial role in providing health care to underserved patient populations (e.g., the uninsured, rural-dwelling individuals) and will likely provide even greater access to care in the future. In some areas of the United States, PAs are the only licensed healthcare providers in the surrounding region. View the sites below for job and career resources.
