I learned about how ingredients in everyday conventional products can affect our bodies. Not only did I clean up my diet and beauty products, but I started swapping out my cleaning products. I had been using brands like [Method](https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/lawsuit-news/consumer-products/cleaning-products/method-class-action-says-cleaning-products-are-toxic/) and Mrs. Meyers which I thought were clean. Turns out, they're not - they're [greenwashing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greenwashing.asp). Most of those products would irritate me when using them. I shouldn't be sneezing, coughing, or having to hold my breath every time I used a cleaning product. When it came time to switch up my household cleaning products, I started by making my own. I used ingredients like vinegar, Castile soap, and essential oils. However, I hadn't found a nontoxic laundry detergent I liked. Plus, Joshua was not a fan of our all-purpose cleaner's vinegar smell. I was definitely open to other alternatives. I kept hearing about the brand [Branch Basics](http://branchbasics.refr.cc/cristinarobinson) in the wellness community. I even got a sample of their foaming wash in the [Organic Bunny Box](https://theorganicbunnybox.com/). After reading [Organic Bunny's review](https://www.theorganicbunny.com/best-non-toxic-cleaning-supplies/), I really liked what I saw (especially the [low ratings on the EWG](https://www.ewg.org/guides/brand/14353-BranchBasics/)). So I decided to give them a try. I liked the idea of using a multipurpose concentrate as it's very cost-efficient. One bottle of their concentrate makes 3 all-purpose cleaners, 3 bathroom cleaners, 3 window cleaners, 3 foaming hand wash bottles, and 1 bottle of laundry detergent (64 loads. I ordered their [Starter Kit + Oxygen Boost](https://branchbasics.com/shop/starter-kit-oxygen-boost/). I definitely noticed a few things right away once I switched: There's a stigma that if it's clean/organic/green then it doesn't work as well as conventional products. Let me tell you, with Branch Basics that is NOT the case. In fact, their cleaner has cleaned things that I haven't been able to get clean with conventional cleaners. For example, let's look at my vintage loveseat: It has drool stains from my doxie licking his bootyhole. Yeah, gross. I tried many remedies/cleaners to get the stains out and none of them worked. I couldn't even take it to the cleaners. I was so close to getting rid of it because I thought I couldn't save it. The thought of parting with it made me sad because it's part of a pair that belonged to my grandmother (my sister has the other one). After I started seeing how well Branch Basics was working around the house, I decided to try it on the loveseat. I consulted their [user guide](https://branchbasics.com/user-guide/) on how to treat stains and used the bathroom spray + Oxygen Boost. First, I gave it a few spritzes and agitated it with a small scrub brush. Next, I sprinkled the Oxygen Boost and then set it with a few more spritzes of the bathroom spray. I gave it a good scrub and let it sit for a while, came back, cleaned it all off, and it was good as new! I don't know what kind of sorcery is in the Oxygen Boost, but it makes the color in everything it touches really pop!Needless to say, I am a huge fan! I use their cleaners for everything I can. I love how nontoxic the concentrate is and how well it works! Seriously, even my husband gave it two thumbs up! He's used it to clean out in the garage, and he said it's done a fantastic job cleaning car parts and grease. If you know my husband, who is a Mercedes tech and gear-head, that says a LOT!
