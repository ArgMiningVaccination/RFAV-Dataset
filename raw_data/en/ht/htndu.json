Signs My Infant Is Teething If you've made it 24 months and haven't seen a significant change in your baby's behavior, you've made it through the teething phase with ease. You're one of the lucky ones! To all my other sleep-deprived moms - if your infant's behavior has taken a turn for the worse, you're not alone. Teething is, more often than not, a not-so-fun phase of life. But don't worry, Mama! Whether your baby is experiencing symptoms or not, both cases are completely normal. Signs and symptoms differ from tot to tot, but some common one's to look out for are: - Increased biting and drooling, which can cause a facial rash - Excessive gum-rubbing and ear-pulling - Intense sucking - Trouble sleeping - Irritability - Decreased appetite, especially for solid foods - Mild temperature elevation (1) These are normal signs that your baby is beginning to teethe. Still, it can be worrisome to watch your little one suffer. But try not to be alarmed: believe it or not, we've all been there. Is Diarrhea a Symptom of Teething? There's a little debate here: some argue that diarrhea is a result of teething while others disagree, saying there's no concrete evidence to support this. (2) My opinion? If your baby is having diarrhea, this could be a sign that they're teething. Your baby is experiencing some added stress with new teeth breaking through their little gums, and diarrhea can be a response to this. However, diarrhea could indicate other conditions. I recommend particular homeopathic remedies when diarrhea is involved. Consult with a naturopathic doctor for the best approach. At-Home Remedies for Teething Relief Finding the best way to relieve your baby's teething pain can be overwhelming. When it comes to soothing your infant's teething pains, simple is best. Here are a few effective remedies: - Rub your little's gums once a day for safe, natural soothing. - Chewing on chilled, solid fruits and vegetables: slice an apple or carrot into smaller cubes. Then place in the refrigerator until chilled for cooling relief. Put inside a teething mesh bag to avoid choking. - Use a chilled washcloth: run a washcloth under cold water and place it in the freezer for 5-10 minutes before your little one gnaws on it. Instead of water, you can dip it in chamomile tea for an added calming effect. - Offer a teething ring: chill in the refrigerator for some extra pain relief. Opt-out of using the freezer to avoid making the ring too hard for your baby's mouth. Simple yet effective is the name of the game here. These remedies are also safe, but always keep an eye on your kiddo when they put anything in their mouth. Homeopathic Remedies Some homeopathic remedies are used to help soothe specific pains. These can be super effective because they treat one particular symptom. Some natural medicines include: - Chamomilla (chamomile): a wonderful natural treatment used to help soothe irritability. Cool a cup of tea. Then use a spoon to give your little one a few sips after a tough night. - Podophyllum: this plant is used when your baby has a loose, watery stool and you observe them pressing their gums together for relief. It's also my first recommendation when teeth seem to take too long to pop through. - Phytolacca: helps relieve your baby's pain when they continue to bite down on everything in sight! - Natrum muriaticum: a natural salt that also helps soothe your baby's pain of clenching their teeth. - Calcarea carbonica: this mineral-based remedy may be just what your little one needs when teething is delayed. - Belladonna: for the angry and restless baby with very red gums. What Methods Should I Avoid? Benzocaine, a key ingredient in Orajel, has been shown to have some dangerous side-effects related to heart rate, seizures, and respiratory failure. (3) Babies can swallow this. And if they swallow too much it can be harmful to their health. With many products on the market, it can be scary when you're unsure of what's good or bad for your baby's health. When you choose homeopathic remedies, you choose the safest route for your baby. Severe Symptoms: When to Call Your Doctor Watching your little one sit with discomfort can be painful not only for them but for you too. Observing a healthy dose of discomfort while teething is normal, but more serious symptoms could mean something else is wrong. Here are some signs that might mean a trip to the doctor: - Congestion - Decreased appetite for liquids - Severe coughing - Rashes in places other than the face [Abnormally high fever](https://theorganiccure.com/blog-1/natural-remedies-for-fever) You Can Do This Mama!
