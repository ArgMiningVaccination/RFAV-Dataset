Walking meditation is different from sitting meditation, but they both have a focus on mindfulness. Mindfulness can be practiced anywhere. You can do it at your desk, while cleaning, and especially while on a walk. Not just walking. Mindfulness is a state of awareness and focus. It's an awareness of every small experience, physical sensation, and emotion you experience without judgment. Walking meditation is being mindful while walking. It involves paying attention to your body's movements, surroundings, feelings, and thoughts. Benefits of Walking Meditation Walking meditation possesses many of the same benefits provided by practicing mindfulness. Because it involves movement, it also provides some physical benefits.

Walking Meditation: First Steps Like most mindfulness practices, you can change the methods to suit your particular needs. Walking meditation differs from taking a stroll by posing limitations to your walk. A traditional form of walking meditation requires purposeful, slow steps in a smaller space. Find a quiet place. An indoor or outdoor space about 25 feet long (10-15 steps). Preferably, finding a space that's without [distractions ](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/jump-start-jan-21/workout-home-distractions)or hurdles will help you focus easier. Relax. Walking meditation is meant to be relaxing. Being aware of your posture and body is an important part of the practice: - Stand up straight without stiffening your back. - Relax your shoulders. - Distribute your weight evenly across your feet. - Clasp your hands behind your back, in front of you, or let them hang at your sides. - Let your gaze relax and drop slightly. - Breathe naturally from your diaphragm. Be mindful of your standing position. Feel your feet touching the ground or floor. Acknowledge the weather or sounds around you. Observe whether your body is tense anywhere. You can follow traditional breathing practice and focus on your breath for a moment, or try a body scan meditation by mentally feeling the different parts of your body. Take your first steps. Without changing your mindset of mindfulness, slowly step forward with your left foot as you inhale. Walk with purpose. Feel each step fully as your foot touches the ground or floor. Walk as if your foot is \"kissing the Earth.\" Feeling your weight shift, step forward with your right foot. Focus your wandering mind. Your mind will wander, and there's no stopping it. However, you can reel it back in by [focusing your attention](https://www.webmd.com/balance/features/pay-attention-be-in-the-now) on one of your senses. Feel your feet touching the ground with each step. Listen to the sounds of your body moving. Feel your breath in your belly or nose. Pause, breathe, and repeat. After you've taken about 15 steps, take in a mindful breath. Turn around, and then walk the path again. Follow this practice for about 5 to 10 minutes. "}
