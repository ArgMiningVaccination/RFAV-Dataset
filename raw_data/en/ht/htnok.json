These critical infrastructures consist of the following sectors and key re-sources: Agriculture a nd Food, Water, Public Health and Healthcare, Emergency Services, the Defense Industrial Base, Information Technology, Telecommunications, Energy, Transportation Systems, Banking and Fi-nance, Chemical, Postal and Shipping, Na-tional Monuments and Icons, Dams, Govern-ment Facilities, Commercial Facilities, and Nuclear Reactors, Materials and Waste. Attacks on critical infrastructure (CI) could disrupt the direct functioning of key business and government activities, facilities, and sys-tems, as well as have cascading effects throughout the Nation's economy and society. The Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in coordination with the Di-rector of the Office of Science and Technol-ogy Policy (OSTP), must prepare on an an-nual basis a federal research and development (R&D) plan in support of the HSPD-7 direc- tive. As the appropriate standing federal in- teragency forum, the Infrastructure Subcom-mittee 1 of the National Science and Technol- ogy Council (NSTC) was tasked with the de-velopment of the annual R&D plan to address critical infrastructure protection (CIP) for the Nation. The HSPD-7 directive also required the de- velopment of a comprehensive, integrated National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP ). This R&D plan was developed in close coordination with the Interim NIPP , released in February 2005. In its first year, the focus of the R&D plan is twofold: 1) the creation of a baseline, including the identifi- 1 The Infrastructure Subcommittee is supported by two interagency working groups, namely Physical Structures and Systems and Critical Information Infrastructure Protection. cation of major research and technology de- velopment efforts within federal agencies, and 2) the articulation of a vision that takes into account future needs and identifies research gaps based on known threats. Agency capa- bilities and near term plans were mapped to R&D focus areas. With this baseline in place and a vision for the future identified, a road-map and investment plan can be developed in the 2005 national critical infrastructure pro- tection R&D planning effort. Role of Science and Technology in Protection of Critical Infrastruc- ture The National Critical Infrastructure Protec- tion Research and Development (NCIP R&D) Plan addresses physical, cyber, and human elements of the critical infrastructure sectors. Guidance for this plan is derived from The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets and The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace . Making the Nation Safer and results from the RAND workshops on critical infrastructure protection provided a broad spectrum of na- tional input for the plan. The NCIP R&D Plan is structured around nine science, engineering, and technology themes that support all critical infrastructure sectors, encompass both cyber and physical concerns, and are strongly integrated in a lay-ered security strategy. The themes are: Detection and Sensor Systems Protection and Prevention Entry and Access Portals Insider Threats Analysis and Decision Support Sys- tems Response, Recovery, and Reconstitu- tion New and Emerging Threats and Vul- nerabilities 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Protection Research and Development Plan viii Advanced Infrastructure Architectures and Systems Design Human and Social Issues The NSTC Infrastructure Subcommittee se- lected these themes for the NCIP R&D Plan based on their repeated appearance in the concerns of infrastructure owners and opera-tors, industry representatives, and government officials. The mapping of these themes across all infrastructure sectors by representatives from all stakeholders confirmed this as a valid approach for identifying and coordinating ne-cessary CIP R&D. The long-term vision of the CIP R&D plan involves three strategic goals. These drive the requirements in the NCIP R&D Plan to assure the future security of the Nation's critical in- frastructure and include: A national common operating picture for critical infrastructure A next-generation computing and communications network with security \"designed-in\" and inherent in all ele- ments rather than added after fact Resilient, self-diagnosing, and self- healing physical and cyber infrastruc-ture systems The NCIP R&D Plan works toward these strategic goals to provide maximum value for the investment made by the Nation and to provide maximum security and resilience within and across infrastructure sectors. This is accomplished by making sure that all ef-forts that contribute toward a strategic goal also provide incremental value by performing an independent CIP function. Achieving these may take more than five years, but the NCIP R&D Plan is designed to provide incremental deliverables in both the short- and mid-term time frames that feed into these long-term goals. Research and Development Rec- ommendations By mapping the long-term over-arching goals to the nine science, engineering, and technol- ogy themes, the following R&D priorities were developed. The list includes examples of ongoing or planned near-term R&D across the federal agencies that will provide valuable shorter term results wh ile adding knowledge and capability required to meet the longer- term strategic goals. R&D Priorities and Contributing Projects 1. Improve Sensor Performance - Develop improved physical and cyber monitoring and detection systems that will include enhance- ments in speed, fewer false-positive readings, reduced power requirements, increased dura-bility, and lower cost. These sensors will have increased sensitivity, be environmentally aware, have higher accuracy, and include both active and passive sensors and robotic plat-forms. Improved sensitivity of detectors for explosives is particularly vital, especially at long distances. Some examples of federal agency efforts that address this priority and are already underway or part of near-term planning include: Developing technology to detect un- exploded ordnance and dangerous ma-terials inside assets and underground facilities. Developing a real-time, Global Posi- tioning System (GPS)-synchronized wide-area measurement sensor system for electric grid monitoring and con-trol. Proceeding with examination of the security and control of transportation infrastructure. This includes sensing, surveillance, and decision support, as well as freight movement, cargo and hazardous materials issues. Creating Sensor Web for Infrastructure Protection (SWIP) to warn of attacks 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Protection Research and Development Plan ix on geographically dispersed or cen- trally located critical infrastructures. Developing improved sensors and sen- sor networks, chemical and biological sensor arrays, and improved explo- sives and radiological detection. Improving sensors for detection of tampering with water systems and building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Improving supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) security for water systems and building HVAC systems in terms of detection of attack and quick alert and response actions. Progressing work on unattended sen- sors that perform ad-hoc networking for autonomous self-healing routing and that provide network security in-cluding authentication, data integrity, and privacy. 2. Advance Risk Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis for Decision Support - Improved capabilities in this area will address all critical infrastructure sectors and their interdependen-cies. Create computer models and algorithms accessible to owners and operators of critical infrastructure that are interoperable and use common inputs and assumptions. Standardize vulnerability analysis and risk analysis of critical infrastructure sectors. Develop the foundations for quan titative and economics- based security and risk assessment. Test, demonstrate, and pilot new projects to inform and train owners and operators of critical in- frastructure. Conduct quantitative risk as-sessments to better quantify terrorism risks to critical infrastructure sectors, including an emphasis in the cyber domain. Broaden the application of integrated modeling, simula- tion, and analysis for real-time decision sup-port and planning. Provide public awareness of the risks, how they are being addressed, and how decisions are being made involving investment, threats, and value to the Nation. Some examples of federal agency efforts that address this priority and are already underway or part of near-term planning include: Continuing to build a fully integrated modeling, simulation, and analysis system decision support and planning capability across all critical infrastruc-ture sectors and their key interdepend-encies. Improving river flow and pipeline network models for use by water utili- ties. Advancing additional modeling, risk assessment, and decision analysis techniques. Conducting full systems analyses on the chemical, water, and other critical infrastructure sectors. 3. Improve Cyber Security - Develop new methods for protection from, automated de-tection of, response to, and recovery from at-tacks on critical information infrastructure systems. Advance the security of basic Inter-net communication protocols. Foster migra- tion to a more secure Internet infrastructure and guide development of next-generation security for Internet protocol-based process control systems and services. Develop soft-ware engineering met hods and tools to sup- port software assurance and more inherently secure software development. Some exam-ples of federal agency efforts that address this priority and are already underway or part of near-term planning include: Initiating an Internet Infrastructure Se- curity R&D Program aimed at improv- ing the security of the domain name system and Internet routing protocols. Establishing a Cyber Security Testbed Program and Large-Scale Network Data Sets Program as infrastructure to support R&D activities. Developing next level cyber secure and reliable computing environments 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Protection Research and Development Plan x including a Secure Linux advanced operating system. Advancing prototype SCADA crypto- graphic module and the American Gas Association (AGA-12) standard upon which the module is based to test the ability to incorporate encryption with-out incurring unacceptable delays in system reactivity. Initiating Adaptive Quarantine re- search project to ensure that the Fed-eral Aviation Administration (FAA) is prepared to pre-empt active, passive, novel, insider or outsider cyber attacks against safety-critical and mission support networks and systems enter- prise-wide. 4. Improve Prevention and Protection - De- velop new, low-cost physical perimeter and area defense systems for critical infrastructure sectors, including systems to mitigate high- explosive blast, projectile, and fire threats. Develop improved portal access and control systems for Chemical, Biological, Radiologi-cal, Nuclear, and High-Explosive (CBRNE) detection, weapon det ection, and personnel identification and authentication. Develop methods for economical hardening of critical physical infrastructures. Develop enhanced monitoring and interpretation systems for automated protection, intrusion prevention and detection, and surveillance in both the physical and cyber domains. Some examples of federal agency efforts that address this pri-ority and are already underway or part of near-term planning include: Developing system control and air quality simulation tools to reduce the vulnerability of facilities to chemical, biological, and radiological aerosols. Adapting critical military technologies for blast protection and intruder analy-sis to water resource and transporta-tion infrastructure. Developing more realistic models of blast effects in urban and rural settings to forecast various impacts including limitations in movement of people and vehicles. Developing low cost perimeter defense systems for physical infrastructure. Adapting robotic technologies de- signed for space exploration missions for utility in hazardous environments. 5. Better Address the Insider Threat - Improve technologies such as intent determination and anomalous behavior monitoring for insider threat detection, covering physical and cyber infrastructures. These build toward integrated methods of personnel surety, document au-thentication, and access authorization. Some examples of federal agency efforts that ad- dress this priority and are already underway or part of near-term planning include: Focusing analytic attention on the most critical information found within massive data sets. This program, which is maturing inside the intelli- gence community, can help the CIP domain in areas such as discovering insider and emerging threats. 6. Improve Large-scale Situational Awareness for Critical Infrastructure - Define the com- munication and computing system architec- ture needed to create a national common op-erating picture (COP) of the Nation's critical infrastructures. Begin to implement multi-database monitoring systems that feed mod-els, train decision support systems, and pro- vide information to protection and response personnel. The bulk of these systems will continue to contain legacy technology for which interfacing may be the best that can be implemented to improve security. These leg- acy elements are not always capable of inte- gration or intelligent collaboration. Provide prototype COP systems including dynamic situational awareness and interpretation. Dy-namic algorithms can adapt and learn as they encounter situations. This is especially criti- cal in a terrorist circ umstance where the use of rigid profiling and template situational analysis may be too simplistic. Provide real- 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Protection Research and Development Plan xi time distributed data collection, visualization, and interpretation. Use pilot studies and test beds to begin to integrate network architec- tures consisting of sensors, controls, real-time data/information, and advance systems to have uniform structures, common languages, interoperability, compatibility, and scalability. Some examples of federal agency efforts that address this priority and are already underway or part of near-term planning include: Developing links between real-time in- telligence threat information with the identification of potentially threatened critical infrastructure. Continuing to develop animal health surveillance strategies and build a na- tional animal health surveillance sys- tem for animal agriculture. 7. Develop Next-Generation Designs and Ar- chitecture for Devices and Systems - Develop next-generation infrastructural concepts, ar- chitectures and systems, both physical and cyber, to include designed-in and built-in se-curity. Create tools and methodologies to support the development of such systems. Systems must become reliable, autonomic (self-repairing and self-sustaining), resilient, and survivable in order to continue to operate in diminished capacity rather than failing in crisis conditions. Sens or networks and ad- vanced materials will be fused into these autonomic systems. Continue development of advanced, economical materials and designs for inherently resilient, self-healing physical infrastructure. Advance physical infrastruc-ture design and construction methods in light of emerging threats, new materials, and resil- iency concepts. Some examples of federal agency efforts that address this priority and are already underway or part of near-term planning include: Advancing and implementing agent architec- ture. Exploring new architectures for secure and resilient cyber and physical infra-structure systems. Developing new high-performance materials, testing procedures, and per- formance modeling capabilities such as high-performance concrete, ad-vanced polymer materials, and appli-cations of nano- and bio-technology in protective materials and devices. 8. Develop a Human-Technology Interface that Allows Better Comprehension and Deci- sions - Develop improved systems and proc- esses that address the interface that necessar-ily occurs between people and technology. Provide an integrated view of societal risks from terrorist events, natural disasters, and other emergencies for incorporation in deci-sion support systems to anticipate and evalu-ate alternative risk reduction investments and emergency response decisions. Some exam- ples of federal agency efforts that address this priority and are already underway or part of near-term planning include: Developing tools to improve the movement and communication of peo-ple within structures under emergency situations. Investigating the social dynamics of terrorism. The Future of the Plan The NCIP R&D Plan is both a national plan and one that will be reviewed and updated annually. It will be used by the Office of Management and Budget as part of their in-formation collection and reporting to high- light homeland security and combating terror- ism efforts across government. Developing a document of this scope, which crosses many federal agencies and involves a broad set of topics, requires the development of relation-ships across agencies and disciplines to achieve a comprehensive understanding of existing capabilities and to coordinate efforts to address knowledge gaps. 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Protection Research and Development Plan xii In its first year, the focu s of the plan has been twofold: 1) the creation of a baseline, includ-ing the identification of major R&D efforts within federal agencies, and 2) the articulation of a vision for the future that takes into ac-count future needs and identifies research gaps based on known threats. Agency capa-bilities and near-term plans were mapped to R&D focus areas to guide future activities. For this reason, the long-term goals of federal R&D associated with CIP are necessarily the highlight of this first plan. In future years, this plan will more strongly integrate both technical and budgetary aspects of R&D efforts in an evolving document that provides researchers, agencies, industry, and non-federal government organizations infor-mation about progress towards solutions, alignment of efforts to meet evolving threats and discovery of needs and vulnerability gaps not previously apparent. With a baseline in place and a vision identified, an investment plan can be developed in the 2005 NCIP R&D planning effort. Future plans will place more emphasis on the identification both of devel-opment efforts that could provide near-term protection and of science and technology ef- forts that are longer-term and more specula- tive but that could provide inherently secure or systemic approaches to the sharp reduction of vulnerabilities. Those documents will also focus on the processes that will help carry government- and privately-financed R&D results through to implementation in what is a largely privately-financed national critical infrastructure. 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Protection Research and Development Plan 1 INTRODUCTION The Nation's infrastructures are the frame- work of physical structures and cyber in-formation networks that provides a contin-ual flow of informa tion, goods, and services essential to the defense and economic secu- rity of the United States. Attacks on critical infrastructure could disrupt the direct func-tioning of key business and government activities, facilities, and systems, as well as have cascading effects throughout the coun- try's economy and society. The September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon demonstrated the high vulnerability of America's infrastructures, and the severe consequences of not protect-ing them. The December 17, 2003 Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 7 (HSPD-7) estab-lished a national policy for federal depart-ments and agencies to identify and prioritize United States critical infrastructures and key resources, and to protect them from terrorist attacks. Further, it established a policy to prepare a national critical infrastructure pro-tection (CIP) research and development (R&D) plan to provide the sustained sci-ence, engineering, and technology base needed to prevent or minimize the impact of future attacks on our physical and cyber infrastructure systems. This document pro-vides the R&D plan required by this Presi-dential Directive. This National Critical Infrastructure Pro- tection Research and Development (NCIP R&D) Plan highlights R&D investments needed to help secure and fortify the Na-tion's infrastructures and key resources from acts of terrorism, natural disasters, or other emergencies. This technical progress is vital to national security, economic vital-ity, and the American way of life. Protection of the Nation's physical and cy- ber infrastructure and the people who oper- ate and use these vital systems is an ex- tremely challenging portion of the overall homeland security effort. Frameworks of critical infrastructure systems continually grow more complex and more interdepend- ent - thus, the NCIP R&D Plan must cross many federal agencies and industries. Be-cause of changes in the spectrum and spe-cifics of threats over time, as well as changes in critical infrastructure technolo- gies over time, this plan must be renewed and improved annually as directed in HSPD-7. National Strategy Guiding this Plan In the National Strategy on Homeland Se- curity , the strategic objectives for the Na- tion are to: Prevent terrorist attacks within the United States. Reduce America's vulnerability to terrorism. Minimize the damage and recover from attacks that may occur. This NCIP R&D Plan documents the major focus areas of science, engineering, and technology required to address all three of these objectives where the critical infra- structure sectors of the Nation are involved. The National Strategy for the Physical Pro- tection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets defined the strategic objectives and identified the key types of infrastructures that may be deemed critical and what must be done to protect them from a number of forms of damage or destruction. The strate-gic objectives identified in that report as underpinning our national critical infra-structure and key resource protection efforts include: Identifying and assuring the protec- tion of those infrastructures and as-sets deemed most critical in terms of national-level public health and safety, governance, economic and 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Protection Research and Development Plan 2 national security, and public confi- dence consequences; Providing timely warning and assur- ing the protection of those infra- structures and assets that face a spe- cific, imminent threat; and Assuring the protection of other in- frastructures and assets that may be-come terrorist targets over time by pursuing specific initiatives and enabling a collaborative environ- ment in which federal, state, and lo-cal governments and the private sec-tor can better protect the infrastruc-tures and assets they control. Consistent with the National Strategy for Homeland Security , the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace identified three strategic objectives: Prevent cyber attacks against Amer- ica's critical infrastructures; Reduce national vulnerability to cy- ber attacks; and Minimize damage and recovery time from cyber attacks that do occur. This NCIP R&D Plan provides the science and technology investment directions needed to enable the National Infrastructure Protection Plan and corresponding respon- sible lead agencies to address these objec- tives. Interconnected Roles of Gov- ernment, Private Industry, and Citizens The National Strategy for the Physical Pro- tection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets also emphasizes that \"Homeland se- curity, particularly in the context of critical infrastructure and key asset protection, is a shared responsibility that cannot be accom-plished by the federal government alone. It requires coordinated action on the part of federal, state, and local governments; the private sector; and concerned citizens across the country.\" This NCIP R&D Plan was assembled by enlisting involvement and input from many federal agencies and used several avenues to understand the needs and concerns of local and state governments and commercial industry, which owns and/or controls the bulk of the critical infrastructures. The facilities, systems, and functions that comprise the physical and cyber critical in-frastructures are highly sophisticated, inter-reliant, and complex. Critical infrastruc- tures are not just buildings and structures - they include people and physical and cyber systems that work together in processes that are highly interdependent. They can be rep-resented as key nodes (such as industrial complexes, airports, control and communi- cation centers, power plants, locks and dams, and farms) and the interconnecting links (such as transportation systems, utili-ties, and the Internet) that are essential to the continued operation of these vital ser- vices. Quantifying and understanding these rela- tionships is essential to protecting the entire framework of critical infrastructures. The interdependencies between these physical and the cyber networks are inescapable; therefore, they must be handled as a \"sys-tem of systems.\" This NCIP R&D Plan directly addresses both the individual assets and their inter-connections and interdependencies. The National Strategy for the Physical Pro- tection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets examined the nature of possible at- tacks and concluded that terrorists target critical infrastructures to achieve three gen- eral types of effects: Direct infrastructure effects: Cas- cading disruption or arrest of the functions of critical infrastructures or key assets through direct attacks 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Protection Research and Development Plan 3 on a critical node, system, or func- tion. Indirect infrastructure effects: Cas- cading disruption and financial con- sequences for government, society, and the economy through public- and private-sector reactions to an at-tack. Exploitation of infrastructure: Ex- ploitation of elements of a particular infrastructure to disrupt or destroy another target. This NCIP R&D Plan takes into account each of these concerns in both the cyber and the physical infrastructures of the country while coordinating with the other national homeland security R&D plans being devel- oped regarding counterin g weapons of mass destruction, standards, emergency prepar-edness and response, social-behavioral-economic issues, and the military and intel- ligence communities' missions of combat- ing terrorism and providing homeland de-fense. Integration of CIP R&D with Other Plans and R&D Commu- nities Other national R&D plans and supporting R&D communities help bound the scope of CIP R&D. These other communities will provide certain capabilities and knowledge essential to realizing national homeland se-curity and critical infrastructure protection goals. For example: The R&D plans focused on counter- ing weapons of mass destruction will provide threat-specific tools and ca- pabilities such as highly sensitive detectors, decontamination methods, and new medical advances to protect public health. The emergency preparedness and re- sponse R&D communities will pro-vide protective clothing and special-ized equipment needed by first re- sponders. The standards R&D community will develop the requirements and certi- fication processes needed to imple- ment research advances in a practi-cal, widespread manner, and achieve interoperability in both physical and cyber systems. The social, behavioral, and eco- nomic R&D community will de-velop, for example, the economic models needed to help understand market and incentive aspects re-quired to sustain security measures in a commercially attractive manner. The intelligence communities will provide information about the types and likelihoods of different threats, with the goal of developing the knowledge and means to stop adver-saries while their plans are still be- ing made - well before acts of ter- rorism can be executed. The military operations and support- ing R&D communities execute and improve the ability to achieve the national security strategy of fighting and defeating adversaries in their homeland - not ours. By coordinating CIP R&D with these many other research communities, this plan is fo-cused more directly on protection and secu-rity advances of the physical and cyber in- frastructure itself. The Critical Infrastructure Sec- tors and Key Resources By means of HSPD-7, the President di- rected the attention of the country's home- land security effort toward the critical infra- structure sectors and key resources identi-fied as: Agriculture and Food 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Protection Research and Development Plan 4 Water Public Health and Healthcare Emergency Services Defense Industrial Base Information Technology Telecommunications Energy Transportation Systems Banking and Finance Chemical Postal and Shipping National Monuments and Icons Dams Government Facilities Commercial Facilities Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste The NCIP R&D Plan , in concert with the other complementary national homeland security R&D plans, is directed at establish-ing the technology, engineering, and science base needed to accomplish the homeland security mission for the subset of these as- sets deemed critical to the Nation. Organization by Themes, Not Sectors In past efforts to examine the homeland se- curity operational and R&D needs of the Nation, the R&D requirements were typi- cally assembled within individual plans by sector. Examples are the plans produced in response to Presidential Directive 63 (PDD-63) issued in 1998. While compelling and detailed, these efforts, separated by sector, contained five common traits that chal- lenged their ability to address effectively and efficiently areas such as R&D. The first of these traits was that many dif- ferent sectors contain infrastructure that is vulnerable to exactly the same threats. For example, almost every national asset is vul-nerable to human- or vehicle-borne explo-sives. Almost all are susceptible to insider threats, chemical attack, and many other types of attack. The use of a sector-based plan for examining operational issues is not appropriate for R&D, as it tends to create artificial repetition and loss of opportunity for integration. The second trait was that the majority did not address the inherent and broadly appli- cable interconnection and interdependence between infrastructure sectors. This plan directly addresses these overarching issues. The third trait of past efforts was the ten- dency to separate the consideration of cyber and physical. These two areas are interde-pendent in all sectors and each can disrupt or disable the other. This NCIP R&D Plan addresses both the cyber and physical realms, and their interdependence, in an integrated manner. A fourth trait was the separation between special efforts to reduce vulnerability and normal efforts to design new infrastructure for higher performance and quality of ser-vice. Efforts to reduce vulnerability can be more effective if they are linked to and in-serted into the normal design process, so that all these goals can support each other. This plan incorporates processes for align- ing these goals for physical and cyber infra-structures. A fifth trait was the challenge of evaluating cross-cutting new threats and opportunities coming from new technological advances which might not be readily incorporated by designers analyzing more specialized sys-tems. This plan specifically examines such crosscutting opportunities with a view to advance these technologies to economically 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Protection Research and Development Plan 5 sustainable and commercially attractive lev- els in the roadmapping effort in 2005. An Evolving R&D Plan The process used to develop this NCIP R&D Plan recognizes that technology, threats, threat levels, adversaries, and value of assets change over time. These time- dependent aspects require that the NCIP R&D Plan be reviewed annually for possi- ble revisions or changes in focus. Such changes will likely appear more quickly than one can start and stop a substantial re- search effort, so there is a requirement for this plan to also contain efforts directed at looking ahead to anticipate emerging threats and have research positioned in case these become a realized threat. An example of an emerging technological threat includes the development of electromagnetic, directed energy, and pulse weapons which do not use traditional ammunition, are unrecogniz- able by most law enforcement personnel, and are generally undetectable unless they are being used. The combination of R&D on the basic needs for critical infrastructure protection with the threat-driven programs and the standards, social-behavioral-economic, in-telligence, military, and other efforts, pro-vides the strength and agility required within the science, engineering, and tech- nology base to meet homeland security challenges that are apparent now and antici-pated in the future. Resilient Infrastructure - Blast protection in the renovated section of the Pentagon helped save lives on September 11, 2001. Offices that were reno-vated suffered essentially no damage as close as 17 meters from the point of impact, while offices not renovated were destroyed as far as 90 meters from the point of impact.

Listed below are a few highlights of recent accomplish-ments and ongoing activities. The Department of Agriculture (USDA): Created a National Surveillance Unit within its Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service's (APHIS) Vet-erinary Services program to provide national leadership in the develop-ment and assessment of animal health surveillance strategies to en- sure that a comprehensive, coordi-nated and integrated national animal health surveillance system is capable of providing bio-surveillance infor- mation on U.S. animal agriculture. The Department of Commerce (DOC): Anticipates publication in December 2004, the results of a two-year inves-tigation of the structural failure and collapse of the World Trade Center buildings to determine necessary changes to building and fire codes, standards and practices, and make recommendations for how to im-prove structural and fire analysis methods, emergency response plans, and evacuation procedures. Developing new test methods for high-performance concrete and ad-vanced polymer materials, and sys-tem control and air quality simula-tion tools to reduce the vulnerability of buildings to chemical, biological, and radiological aerosols. Conducting studies to develop tools that improve the movement and communication of people within structures under other emergency situations. Developing cyber security standards and guidelines. The Department of Defense (DoD): Created the capability to link real- time intelligence threat information with the identification of potentially threatened critical infrastructure. Delivered advances in the cyber arena in the critical realm of autonomous software agent technol- ogy including multi-agent system in-teroperability and cognitive agent architecture. Adapting critical military technolo- gies for blast protection and intruder analysis to water resource infrastruc- tures such as dams, locks, bridges, tunnels, and power plants. Developing realistic models of blast effects in urban and rural settings to forecast various impacts including limitations in movement of people and vehicles. Developing technology which seeks to protect facilities from chemical, biological, and radiological attacks. The Immune Building project is one example. Developing technology to detect un- exploded ordnance and dangerous materials inside assets and under-ground facilities. Progressing work on unattended sensors that perform ad-hoc net-working for autonomous self-healing routing and that provide network se- curity including authentication, data integrity, and privacy. 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Protection Research and Development Plan 8 The Department of Energy (DOE): Developed decontamination foam that neutralizes chemical and bio-logical agents in minutes. Created the Risk Assessment Meth- odology (RAM) family of risk analysis tools, which was applied over assets ranging from an entire community, to a dam, and a single property. Conducting development, evalua- tion, and deployment of a real-time, Global Positioning System (GPS)-synchronized wide-area measure-ment sensor system for electric grid monitoring and control is underway along with the creation of plans for a federal/electric industry partnership to have 300 sensors in place in the Eastern U.S. and Western U.S. by the end of 2005. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS): Developed new personal protective gear of both a general and threat-specific nature. Efforts include a bio-electronic telemetry system for firefighter safety, Chemical and Bio- logical Warfare (CBW) protective clothing for civilian protection, a personal electronic dosimeter, and a downed firefighter location system. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS): Produced an initial version of a fully integrated modeling, simulation and analysis system for use by national and regional leaders with decision support and planning capability across all critical infrastructure sec- tors and their key interdependencies. Completed an analysis of how to protect current process control sys-tems (SCADA and DCS). Conducting full systems analyses on the Chemical, Water, and other criti-cal infrastructure sectors Established a virtual National Cyber Security R&D Center as the um- brella under which distributed DHS- funded cyber security R&D activi-ties will be performed. The center supports public-priva te partnerships through interactions with university and industry research groups, cyber security product and service ven-dors, and the venture capital com-munity. Established two multi-university testbed projects through the Cyber Security Testbed Program with co- funding from the National Science Foundation. The first of these pro-jects produced an operational physi-cal network environment to support testing activities, and the second is developing a testing framework and conducting experiments on the physical testbed. These activities are advancing our ability to conduct simulated attacks, develop an under- standing of those attacks, and test cyber security methods and protec-tion technologies, all in a large-scale operational network environment that is kept isolated from the public Internet. Performed a study to enhance under- standing of insider threats and in-sider activities that can damage in-formation systems and data in criti-cal infrastructure sectors. The study , performed by the United States Se- cret Service and Carnegie Mellon University's Software Engineering Institute, provided a comprehensive analysis of insider actions by analyz-ing both the behavioral and technical aspects of the threats, and produced findings intended to help prevent se- rious crimes such as network intru-sions, identity theft, and financial fraud 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Protection Research and Development Plan 9 The Department of the Interior (DOI): Examined blast effects on embank- ment dam crests and methods of hardening, and effects of underwater blasts on steel spillway gates and concrete dams. The Department of Justice (DOJ): Completed a study on the real cost and consequences of insider threats. The study included multiple indus- tries and the impacts and losses as- sociated with this type of attack. The Department of Labor (DOL): Developing guidance for the protec- tion, decontamination, and training of hospital-based first receivers of victims from mass casualty incidents involving the release of hazardous substances including chemical weapons of mass destruction. Developing a Disaster Site Worker Training Program to yield a cadre of skilled support personnel and clean- up workers highly trained to respond safely to disasters. The Department of Transportation (DOT): Proceeding with a renewed examina- tion of the security and control of highways, bridges, tunnels and inter- modal facilities and reducing the risk of highway systems being used as a means to deliver an attack. This in-cludes sensing, surveillance and de-cision support as well as freight movement, cargo, and Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) issues. Initiated Adaptive Quarantine re- search project to ensure that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is prepared to pre-empt ac-tive, passive, novel, insider or out- sider cyber attacks against safety- critical and mission support net-works and systems enterprise-wide. Identified an integrated solution that consists of a combination of proac- tive behavior-based tools and reac- tive rules-based tools that cover all layers of the protocol stack. Com-pleted laboratory evaluation and proof of concept demonstration; pi-lot testing is underway. Operational procedures are being developed to indicate which features/functions are enabled at different FAA InfoCon Levels (that correspond to the DHS national threat levels). Since this so- lution relies on Commercial-Off- The-Shelf (COTS) products, it is transferable to other federal agen-cies. The Department of the Treasury (Treasury): Working with industry to document the financial sector's research and development requirements. The Treasury's Office of Critical Infra-structure Protection and Compliance Policy (CIP&CP) has been working with public and private sector insti- tutions in the financial and banking sector to assess vulnerabilities and highlight areas for improvement. As part of this effort, CIP&CP has cre-ated a research and development agenda aimed at improving both the state-of-the-art in CIP as well as the state-of-the-practice as it relates to this sector of the economy. Projects oriented to closing the gap between available state-of-the-art technolo- gies and business practices and those implemented in practice are a par-ticular priority. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA): Working to produce effective and af- fordable methods, technologies, equipment, and other tools needed to protect drinking water and wastewa-ter systems from purposeful attacks. Protection against contamination of 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 10 drinking water systems is the highest homeland security priority for EPA; physical and cyber security of the Nation's drinking water and waste- water systems are also addressed. The products of this R&D are de-signed for use by drinking water and wastewater utility personnel, emer-gency and follow-up responders, states, EPA regional offices, and others involved in protecting human health and the environment. Working to produce useful, afford- able, reliable, tested, effective tech-nologies and guidance needed by in- frastructure owners and managers, emergency responders, decontami-nation crews, and waste disposal personnel for detecting, containing, decontaminating, and disposing of hazardous biological and chemical materials purposefully introduced into critical facilities. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC): Established the position of Deputy Executive Director for Homeland Protection and Preparedness to in- crease the agency's attention on crosscutting issues that affect secu-rity, incident response, emergency preparedness, vulnerability assess- ments, and mitigation strategies. Created the Office of Nuclear Secu- rity and Incident Response to im-prove oversight of security and emergency preparedness. Performed vulnerability studies us- ing state-of-the-art structural and fire analyses to realistically predict po- tential consequences of terrorist acts. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA): Maintaining 19 earth observation satellites and a robust suborbital program that includes both UAV's and piloted aircraft, which are being considered to detect and track tech- nological hazards. These capabili- ties are derived from an established program in advanced data manage-ment, computer modeling, and data assimilation that support predictions on transport and dispersion of air- borne hazards or pathogens. Improving aviation safety and secu- rity through research in aircraft sys-tems hardening, securing of air space operations, and enhanced cargo-screening techniques. Evaluating the potential NASA's space program has to offer the appli-cation of advanced (nuclear, biologi-cal, radiological, and chemical) sen-sors (satellite, airborne, and in situ) for the detection of threats. Examining robotic technologies de- signed for space exploration mis-sions for utility in hazardous envi-ronments in the support of critical infrastructure protection. The National Science Foundation (NSF): Supporting fundamental research in all areas of science, engineering, and technology important for homeland security. Supporting research projects that range from blast impacts, to physical infrastructure models for systems and structures, applications of nano- and bio-technology in protective ma- terials and devices, social dynamics of terrorism, cybertrust (inherently secure and reliable computing envi-ronments) and cyber security, new architectures for secure and resilient cyber and physical infrastructure systems, integrated computational and information resource develop-ment, and sensors and sensor net- works. 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 11 The National Security Agency (NSA): Developed projects for securing the next generation of cyberspace, in-cluding a Secure Linux advanced operating system for next level cyber security. Focusing analytic attention on the most critical information found within massive data sets. This pro-gram, which is maturing inside the Intelligence Community, can help the CIP domain in areas like discov-ering insider and emerging threats. The Technical Support Working Group (TSWG): Developed a working prototype Su- pervisory Control and Data Acquisi-tion (SCADA) cryptographic mod- ule and the American Gas Associa-tion (AGA-12) standard upon which the module is based to test the ability to incorporate encryption in SCADA without incurring unacceptable de-lays in system reactivity. Creating Sensor Web for Infrastruc- ture Protection (SWIP) to warn of attacks on geographically dis- persed or centrally located critical infrastructures. Attacks on United States Forces from 1983 through 2001 - More Department of Defense personnel we re killed in terrorist attacks during this time period than in combat, including the September 11, 2001 attack on the Pentagon.

The NCIP R&D Plan is aimed at helping provide the maximum value for the investment made by the Nation and the maximum security and resilience within and across infrastructure sectors. An aspect of this new plan is the requirement that it be reviewed and revised annually across all agencies of federal gov- ernment. It is the first, all-agency R&D plan directed at such a large and complex set of issues. The strength of future ver-sions will increase as the collection and col-laboration processes within and across the agencies mature and become proactive. Strategic Vision for National CIP R&D The long-term vision of the NCIP R&D Plan involves three strategic goals: A national common operating pic- ture for critical infrastructures A next-generation Internet architec- ture with security \"designed-in\" and inherent in all elements rather than added after fact. Resilient, self-diagnosing, and self- healing physical and cyber infra-structure systems The following section describes R&D ac- tivities and principles that will enable work toward these strategic goals. It is important to note that, while the sections below pro-vide a glimpse into a visionary future, R&D being performed today that aligns with these strategic goals will also provide more incremental\u2014and near-term\u2014improvements to security and protection capabilities. National Common Operating Picture (COP) for Critical Infrastructure . Strategic goal: integrate infrastructure monitoring and support systems, including decision support systems with data collection, integration, analysis, and visualization capabilities that can provide, in real time, analysis results and reports on the status and security of the country's key assets. Real-time situational awareness capability would provide a na-tional COP, and the heart of the system would be a sensor network that is intelli- gent, self-monitoring, and self-healing to allow continuous operation for situation monitoring and information transfer. It would be able to feed computational models to analyze specific issues, train decision support systems, and provide information to protection and response personnel. A na-tional CIP knowledge resource would main-tain, operate, manage, a nd control the data. Decision-makers would use risk-based deci-sion-support tools to continuously manage asset integrity and perform viability moni- toring to minimize loss and maximize safety in natural, accidental, and perpetrated events. Next-Generation Internet Architecture with Designed-in Security . Strategic goal: de- velop a next-generation Internet architecture that is more secure than the existing Internet by designing security and protection meas-ures at all levels from the basic hardware components up through all levels of soft- ware. This new communication network would preserve many of the basic principles that are fundamental to today's Internet, but would ensure that security is a prominent technical requirement during the design and architecture development phases, rather than addressed as a post-development op-erational issue or patch. Fundamental pro-tocols associated with Internet communica-tions would be modified or replaced to en-sure the highest level of confidentiality, availability, and integrity across multiple communication layers. Rethinking the rout-ing of network traffic and network man-agement approaches w ill result in a more 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 14 robust and resilient Internet, where commu- nications can be prioritized, and where op-erations can be made sustainable under cri- sis conditions. The capabilities built into this architecture would provide the basis for a computing and communications infra-structure that can be relied upon with a far greater degree of trust and confidence than today's networks. The result would be an infrastructure that not only overcomes many of the risk barriers that exist for today's ap-plications, but that also enables new ap-proaches to increasing productivity and en-hancing the Nation's economic competitive- ness. Resilient, Self-diagnosing, Self-healing Sys- tems - Strategic goal: develop replacement elements and systems for our physical and cyber infrastructures that are resilient if at- tacked or damaged, can manage or contain the extent of damage, can continue to pro-vide service (even if at diminished capac-ity), and can adapt and self-heal damaged areas. Some of this effort will involve en-hancing these systems with computerized sensors and software agents that can collect, analyze, and report information about the condition of the infrastructure, and suggest or implement ways to adapt, reroute, or re-distribute loads to mitigate damages. For physical infrastructure, this effort would involve advanced material science to pro-duce materials that self-heal fractures, have extreme strength, or that can deform and absorb energy but then go back to their original shape. Advanced new manufactur- ing processes may be patterned after bio- logical processes, such as those used in naturally-occurring self-assembled nanos-tructures or DNA/RNA replication. Resil-ient design concepts such as high-strength designs for load reversal or redistribution would be developed, designs would encom-pass sacrificial zones to control how energy is absorbed and damage is controlled, emerging materials and systems would be used, and design concepts to slow the rate at which failure takes place would be gener- ated. Resilient features in both cyber and physical systems and especially their inte-gration would be incorporated in critical assets collections such as adaptive, intelli- gent power grids. Intelligent computer software systems that can mutate and im- prove to protect and repair themselves would be built, such that these systems could withstand a catastrophic event with a minimum of loss or disruption or even avoid damage by adaptation. Advanced Materials and Resilient Design In the September 11, 2001 attack on the Penta- gon, blast protection in the walls and windows, new fire protection syst ems, and extra strength- ening in the original structural framework of columns and beams delayed collapse for more than 30 minutes, allowing more people to safely evacuate and more emergency response meas- ures to be brought to bear on the crisis. Without these features, the number of casualties would have been significantly larger. Soil is an example of a material that self-heals fractures and absorbs energy. The embankment dam engineering community uses concepts of self-healing fractures and deformable, high strength, and sacrificial zones to protect the in- tegrity of the impermeable core of a dam from \"load reversal\" such as the dynamic loads from an earthquake. Biologically-based systems have the ability to evolve through mutation. By attempting to mimic nature, nanotechnology engineers and scientists are learning how to create amazing new materials. An example of this biologically- based design process is nanotechnology-based manufacture of lightweight shells that are lay- ered composites of tough and soft materials modeled after processes shellfish use to form their protective environment. Resilient self-healing systems require a complete overhaul from the core of operat-ing systems and fundamental chip logic to the operation of new sensors so small and inexpensive that they can be used almost anywhere and can talk to each other using a relay technique. These systems would in-corporate advances in materials science and biological or optical designs for computing systems that would be resistant to electro- magnetic disturbances. Such systems are 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 15 critical to the next-generation Internet that is, in turn, critical to the creation of a na-tional COP. Emerging Computing Platforms of the Future Advanced biological systems may one day inte- grate computing and sensing with chemical and biological processes where molecules replace transistors and chemical exchange replaces wires and electricity. Optical computer platforms could use light pho- tons rather than electricity to perform the com- putations and exchange information without wires or connectors. Such systems are resistant to damage from sources such as electromagnetic pulse disruption. The quantum computer would convey informa- tion based on the spin of an electron, and can use more than just \"ones and zeros\" (binary states) to perform functions that may allow us to solve problems we cannot even express mathe- matically to current computers. All three systems could potentially possess the ability to automatically respond to damage or disruption and to become more resilient to future injury. Examples of each of these platforms ex- ist in very simplified form in government and industry labs today. The Themes and Future Capa- bilities The nine themes of this R&D plan were chosen to contribute to the achievement of the long-term strategic goals for CIP out-lined above and to also frame activities that would provide incremental security and pro-tection in the physical and cyber infrastruc- ture in the short- and mid-term timeframes as well. For each of the nine themes listed below, an example is given of a key future capability that must be accomplished to make progress towards the long-term strate-gic goals described above. THEME 1 : Detection and Sensor Systems - Detection and sensor systems and related integration needs. FUTURE CAPABILITY: Systems and tools to detect and sense what is occurring or anticipate actions. THEME 2 : Protection and Prevention - Protection of assets and prevention of suc-cessful attacks against them. FUTURE CAPABILITY: Systems, tools, methods, and permissions to protect assets and connections critical to the Nation. THEME 3 : Entry and Access Portals. FUTURE CAPABILITY: Prevent unau- thorized access to important places and sys-tems. THEME 4 : Insider Threats. FUTURE CAPABILITY: Protect systems against a trusted party who has passed all controls, is inside key assets, and proceeds to do harm. THEME 5 : Analysis and Decision Support Systems. FUTURE CAPABILITY: Tools that can analyze complex and difficult problems and support decision making in the most inte-grated and informed ways possible. THEME 6 : Response, Recovery, and Re- constitution. FUTURE CAPABILITY: Be prepared to manage a critical event situation from initial response to final replacement of the lost asset or capability. THEME 7 : New and Emerging Threats and Vulnerabilities. FUTURE CAPABILITY: Develop the tools, methods, and technologies to discover at the earliest possible time that an adver-sary can now deliver a new threat. THEME 8 : Advanced Infrastructure Ar- chitectures and Systems Design. 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 16 FUTURE CAPABILITY: Build new sys- tems that do not have the faults or limita-tions of past systems and technologies that were created at a time when security was not a driving design issue. THEME 9 : Human and Social Issues. FUTURE CAPABILITY: New user inter- faces that accept, organize and present un-precedented quantities of information in a form that enables much faster understanding and more accurate decision-making in cri- ses. By mapping the themes of the NCIP R&D Plan across the three long-term strategic goals, one can envision a picture similar to the following three diagrams. Since every contribution of each theme cannot be shown on a single diagram, these are representative examples designed to show how individual themes combine to enable the larger goals. 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 17 Examine intent, monitor & mine data to find new patterns Examine intent, monitor & mine data to find new patternsNext generation detection and reporting framework Next generation detection and reporting framework Behavior of operators, responders, owners, and victims Behavior of operators, responders, owners, and victims Real-time National feeds to decision support system Real-time National feeds to decision support systemAnticipate intention, retract duties Anticipate intention, retract dutiesReal-time feeds on status of protection & control Real-time feeds on status of protection & controlAutomated surveillance, eliminate false readings Automated surveillance, eliminate false readingsNew high volume communication systems New high volume communication systems National Common Operating PictureNew and emerging threats and vulnerabilities New and emerging threats and vulnerabilitiesDetection and sensor systems Detection and sensor systems Advanced infrastructure architecture and systems design Advanced infrastructure architecture and systems design Minimizing the impact of any threat and feeding the COP with data about real status of assets Minimizing the impact of any threat and feeding the COP with data about real status of assetsSensing rogue behavior in a trusted resource Sensing rogue behavior in a trusted resourceProviding tools to aid responders and leaders in handling a tragedy with full awareness of events Providing tools to aid responders and leaders in handling a tragedy with full awareness of eventsKnowing who is where, their roles & permissions and what they may carry Knowing who is where, their roles & permissions and what they may carryAnticipating the reactions and actions of those involved in an event Anticipating the reactions and actions of those involved in an eventDiscover from the COP patterns, tools, capabilities and devices we have not previously seen.

In particular, these other non-CIP federal plans provide: Advanced detection and sensor sys- tems for biological, chemical, radio-logical, nuclear, and explosives threats Vaccines and other medical coun- termeasures for those exposed to biological, chemical, and/or radio- logical threats Neutralization, containment, and de- contamination techniques for bio-logical, chemical, radiological, and nuclear threats Biometrics for positive identification at the Nation's borders Secure tagging and tracking of cargo Standards and certification Urban search and rescue Development of robotic assistants for first responders Protective clothing, advanced sen- sors, and special gear for first re-sponders, including location finders and electronic credentials Tags for traceability of nuclear ma- terials Intelligence data collection and syn- thesis Advanced behavioral and psycho- logical modeling of terrorists CIP and Other R&D Communi- ties Examination of these other non-CIP plans helps define the technological gaps that the CIP plan must cover. For example, the non-CIP plans for chemical, biological, radio-logical, and nuclear countermeasures in- clude measures to protect people, food, and water supplies, and decontaminate facilities; however, the CIP plan must include tech-nologies to protect the infrastructure itself from damaging chemicals, biological, and radiological exposure. No other national plan focuses on cyber attacks, nor on recov- ery of the critical services the CI networks provide; hence these issues are central to the NCIP R&D Plan . The following figure il- lustrates this connectivity and complemen- tary nature of the CIP and non-CIP national R&D plans across different technical com-munities. 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 21 Figure 4. Efforts across multiple R&D communiti es are needed to realize national critical infrastructure protection R&D strategic goals. The NCIP R&D Plan is both a national plan and one that will be reviewed and updated annually. It will be used by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as part of their collection and reporting efforts to highlight homeland security efforts across government; however, the NCIP R&D Plan is not simply focused on federal govern- ment efforts. Liaison activities with the Sector Coordinating Councils from the dif-ferent CI sectors will help establish the boundary lines between R&D needs and initiatives being done by private industry and those being done by government - im- portant because of the large percentage of private ownership of critical infrastructure. An example of this is the energy sector, where most of the oil extraction, power generating, and fuel-processing facilities are not owned by government but rather by pri- vate industry. Sector Coordinating Coun- cils may use Information Sharing and Analysis Centers, which provide a forum for information sharing between govern- 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 22 ment and non-government entities, as one mechanism to inform owners and operators about federal R&D programs. Critical infrastructure sectors are described in the National Strategy for Homeland Se- curity and The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastruc- tures and Key Assets . The scope of critical infrastructures is vast. To focus CIP R&D efforts and define the limits of CIP areas, this plan takes into account the many R&D plans being developed across government agencies and the private sector to combat terrorism. These plans are coupled to the issues also found in the cross-agency Com- bating Terrorism R&D Report (please see http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg/20 03_combat_terr.pdf ). This report is an ex- amination of programs conducted each year and reported through OMB. Starting in 2006, the Combating Terrorism R&D Re- port and this annual NCIP R&D Plan will be reported together in a special section of the budget to give a more complete picture of these issues. Secure Next-Generation Internet Architecture - Next-generation Inter- net architecture will be more secure, guaranteeing authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality across multiple communication layers, sustainable under crisis conditions due in pa rt to advanced nanotechnology. National Common Operating Picture for Critical Infrastructures - Monitoring systems and support systems perform dynamic data analysis that is transmitted to decision makers for real-time reports on the security of the Nation's critical assets. 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 23 DETAILED THEME DESCRIPTIONS AND RESEARCH EFFORTS The use of science and technology themes is a way of organizing and pursuing advances and breakthroughs for critical infrastructure protection (CIP). Within each theme, there are definitions and statements of scope, and a number of complementary focus areas that combine to fully cover the topic in the con-text of CIP. Theme 1 - Detection and Sensor Systems Detection and Sensor Systems as they sup- port the National Critical Infrastructure Pro-tection Strategic Goals - Examples: National Common Operating Picture (COP) for Critical Infrastructure: Learning status, condition, needs, concerns, actions, and behaviors of all assets and participants. Inherently Secure Next-Generation Comput- ing and Communications Network: Crea- tion of software agents for security and automation of operations. Resilient, Self-Diagnosing, and Self-Healing Physical and Cyber Infrastructure Systems: Providing sensors that integrate data, exam- ine at systems levels, sense errors, and guide repairs. Although all infrastructures require sensors to aid in protection or to detect threats and gauge the degree of concern and response, the research plans for certain sensors and detectors belong to other research and de-velopment (R&D) communities, most nota- bly for chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive sensors. The stan-dards R&D community will provide the certification and interoperability standards needed for these sensors and systems. However, how sensor systems are used, placed, managed, and integrated with other subsystems and the overall operational con-trols and information-communication archi-tecture in critical infrastructures are all part of CIP. This CIP R&D scope does include develop- ing sensors to detect intruders to both physical and cyber infrastructures, including sensors that monitor and report the status and condition of the infrastructure. In addi- tion, there are detection and sensing R&D tasks that are not related to a particular de-vice, but rather to ways of processing sensor data to extract anomalies and identify pat-terns that are part of the CIP R&D scope . Effective protection of critical infrastructure (CI) requires increased innovation and de-velopment of advanced, intelligent detection and sensor systems for both physical and cyber aspects of CI. These sensor systems must rapidly and accurately locate and characterize threats against CI, such as acts of cyber or physical intrusion, or the pres-ence of chemicals and/or explosives. The sensors can also be used to monitor and re-port the condition of the various nodes (such as power plants and industrial com- plexes) and links (such as transportation systems and utilities) that form CI networks. In addition to advanced sensing capabilities and increased reliability, sensors must communicate with each other and be de- ployed at many locations to form a robust network. The deployment platforms may be fixed locations, such as embedded in the construction materials of physical infra-structure, or mobile, such as unmanned air- craft, unmanned vehicles, unmanned sub- mersibles, other types of robotics, or even animals. In cyber systems, the sensors may take the form of intelligent autonomous software agents that can travel throughout a computing or communications network. These networked systems of sensors must be smart, self-organizing, self-healing, and capable of analysis and reporting. Sensors will need to be developed to cover all possible avenues of physical and cyber attack, and tailored to the environmental conditions under which they must operate. In the future, sensors must be able to either adapt to the environment of the attack, or be 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 24 diverse enough to incorporate a different physical means of data collection to opti-mize performance. For example: If optical or infrared frequencies in the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum used by remote sensing satellites and surveillance air- craft are obscured by changing light and tem- perature conditions at dawn and dusk, then sen- sors need the ability to switch to a different por- tion of the EM spectrum, such as the microwave or millimeter bandwidths. Detection systems must also have the ability to switch to a different physical approach to sense magnetic, seismic, acoustic, radioactive, or gravitational changes, either from a satellite, airborne, robotic, or Earth-based platform (on the ground, under- ground, on the water, or underwater.) Massive amounts of data will need to be processed and analyzed to selectively filter out background signals in order to detect anomalies or patterns. The data and analy-sis results will feed into many other sensors and sensor systems, and undergo further analysis to provide actionable information to intelligence, law enforcement, and deci- sion makers about terrorist or other suspi- cious or potentially damaging activities. Advancement of pattern recognition analy-ses will require novel approaches, possibly based on human thinking processes and in- stincts. Much of the existing sensor knowledge de- veloped by government agencies and pri-vate industry can be applied to CIP without further R&D. However, because the major-ity of this work initially was not focused specifically on CIP or homeland security, a substantial level of effo rt may be required to find and organize this knowledge, and mod-ify and tailor it to current and anticipated needs. Some of these previous techniques may require declassification or modification from their original state in the DoD, DOE, or other agency archives. Some may re-quire efforts to clear the ownership of the intellectual property or to make them com-mercially acceptable in cost and maintain- ability. At a minimum, these sensors will need to be integrated into new systems and applications. Within the Detection and Sensor Systems Theme, the following general categories will be addressed: Intrusion Small Arms Explosives Intent Humans (Actors and Victims) Intelligent Sensor Systems Assessment and Response to an Event Focus Areas for Detection and Sensor Systems a) Intrusion The science of physical intrusion detection and sensing involves surveillance in many forms, as well as the interpretation of that surveillance data. Cyber intrusion detection considers similar concerns of sensing and identification, but addresses them in digital network space. Current emphasis on physical intrusion de- tection involves improved and more auto- mated surveillance, sustaining optimal de- tection capability under varied weather and terrain conditions, faster and more accurate recognition and interpretation of intrusion alerts (versus false or nuisance alarms), and feeding of results to sophisticated intention analysis tools to categorize threats and log vulnerabilities. Wireless technologies are increasingly cru- cial to automation, communication, and in-formation technology systems pervasive throughout the critical infrastructure sectors. Wireless networks, already vulnerable due to limited security, face increased risks from 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 25 mobile wireless nodes that can enter, trav- erse, and leave the network. The advanced sensor systems may be physical, like smart dust (advanced, com- puterized micro-sensors that can talk to each other and report findings), or they may be cyber such as autonomous software agents and intelligent software savants that can maneuver through digital network space, detect and examine anomalous be- havior or activities, and set up a way to quarantine the intruder to prevent serious cyber damage. To achieve the strategic goals of the COP, secure Internet, and resilient infrastructure, the CIP research challenges for intrusion detection and sensor systems are to make these smart systems so they can be perva-sively distributed throughout CI. Needed advances include fewer false alarms and advanced tracking and analysis capabilities such as pattern recognition and anticipatory algorithms. The results of such analyses can be used to trigger or direct next steps for protective measures discussed in Theme 2: Protection and Prevention. Detection and sensor systems need to be advanced to fully secure wireless platforms. There is a need to develop sensor systems that can monitor and report the condition of the infrastructure, measure and report dam- age, quantify diminished service, and esti-mate downtime for repairs. Smart sensor systems can be programmed to suggest re-pair alternatives, which will require integra-tion and communication with the advanced analysis and decision support systems dis- cussed in Theme 5: Analysis and Decision Support Systems. b) Small Arms The detection of weapons has been a major focus of the DoD and has fostered research throughout the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and other groups for decades. The Nation must have effective weapon sensing systems that are practical for implementation in both gov-ernment and privately owned CI. Weapons of an explosive or penetrating nature may be detected by sensing their chemical and metallurgical makeup, emissions from these materials, or traceable tags embedded in the materials in their manufacture. Millimeter-wave imaging systems have shown consid-erable promise at sensing metallic and non-metallic small arms through clothing. Additional weapons that are likely to be used include direct and/or indirect fire standoff weapons such as sniper rifles and small military hand-held or homemade mor-tars and rockets. Military counter-battery systems are available for protection against some of these weapons. Current protection methods against these penetration weapons is poor, thus there is a need to improve both their detection and methods to prevent them from being used effectively against CI. In order to realize the strategic goals of the COP, secure Internet, and resilient infra-structure, the CIP research challenges for small arms detection and sensor systems are to incorporate specific small arms systems into the pervasive intrusion detection net- works for rapid, on-the-fly identification of potential small arms in the vicinity of CI. This information needs to be communicated to other elements of the security system to trigger activation of appropriate protective and response measures (activating protec-tive measures in place before a damaging event can occur, as discu ssed in Theme 2: Protection and Prevention; and activating effective response and recovery measures after a damaging event, as discussed in Theme 6: Response, Recovery, and Recon-stitution.) c) Explosives Explosives involve blast pressure and heat wave-inducing energetic materials. There are a multitude of explosive materials avail-able from military or commercial sources. For example, C4, Semtex, TNT, RDX, PETN are typically associated with military use, and dynamite and ammonium nitrate- based explosives are typically associated 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 26 with commercial use. There are also ther- mobaric weapons that contain enhanced energetic materials; propellants (such as black powder and compressed air); and hundreds of potential homemade or impro-vised materials (such as cleaning fluid). Explosives come in many forms: as muni-tions (with or without shrapnel, and similar lethality or damage-enhancing materials); as solid or plastic units (such as dynamite and C-4); in bulk form that can be easily loaded in cars, trucks, or barges (such as ammo-nium nitrate and fuel oil, also known as ANFO); in liquid form that can be poured into containers or pipes (such as slurries and nitromethane); and in gaseous form (such as acetylene, propane, and fuel-air munitions). The size of explosive threats can range from tiny letter-borne devices, to mid-scale trucks and railroad cars, to large-scale barge and ship-borne devices. The heightened sensing abilities of certain animals have been helpful in detection of explosives and other contraband materials. Canines are used to good effect to screen baggage and dolphins have assisted with finding submerged mines in waterways. Existing commercial detection devices, in-cluding those used for airline baggage screening, are capable of detecting explo- sives material only when it has been directly sampled. Additionally, X-ray based tech-nologies are capable of imaging material within the packaging. However, these tech-nologies do not have the capability to per-form at standoff ranges, are slow, and they suffer diminished performance against con- cealment efforts. Explosives detection research incorporated in other national explosive R&D plans are developing technologies that can perform with a false alarm rate that is sufficiently low for use in high throughput cases, that function at an increased range to allow standoff detection of explosives, and that are applicable for the screening of humans when health concerns may prohibit certain methods such as those employing X-rays. CIP looks to other R&D communities to provide the needed explosives sensors to achieve situational awareness in the COP strategic goal. To accomplish the strategic goals of the COP, secure Internet, and resilient infra- structure, the CIP research challenges for explosives detection and sensor systems are the integration of these sensors with the whole array of sensors being developed. These sensor systems will feed detection information to access control systems as discussed in Theme 3: Entry and Access Portals, to ask questions such as, \"Is this type and amount of explosive supposed to be in this area?\" These systems and reporting information need to be linked to analyses to predict per-formance of the facility and hazards to peo-ple in the immediate area given the amount of explosives detected and nature of the fa- cility (Theme 5: Analysis and Decision Support Systems). Smart sensor analytical capabilities need to advance to conduct valid situational assessments to reliably suggest or trigger appropriate responses and protective measures (Theme 2: Protection and Prevention) before there is a disastrous incident. d) Intent The detection of intent involves examining combinations of observations, actions, rela- tionships, and past history in order to accu- rately sense whether a person, group, or series of events might be the purveyor of or precursor to terrorist events. Intent detec-tion is an integral part of activities including insider threat detection, the detection of un- authorized participants, and unauthorized acts. Psychologically/physiologically-oriented sensors that can accurately determine a per-son's physiological and behavioral state are a key tool that can be used to corroborate intent to compromise the Nation's security. There are national Social, Behavioral, and Economic R&D plans being developed along these lines. CIP looks to these plans to develop the behavioral knowledge base 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 27 and indicators needed to apply sensing technologies to determination of intent. A more comprehensive discussion on intent detection, including CIP research challenges for integration of behavioral and cyber in-formation, is located in Theme 4: Insider Threats. e) Humans (Actors and Victims) The detection of humans (or robotics such as unmanned vehicles) as intruders was dis- cussed in focus area a): Intrusion. These intrusion detection systems involve visual, sound, motion, thermal, electromagnetic, and seismic sensing, and the use of the heightened sensing abilities of animals such as guard dogs and dolphins working on the ground, underground, in the air, on the wa-ter, underwater, and inside facilities. There is also a need for the detection of people both during and following an inci- dent including keeping track of rescuers and finding survivors, the injured or the casual-ties of an attack. The ability to find these people in unstable debris with potential gas and liquid contaminations and obscuring agents such as fire and other impediments is a dire need. The safe, rapid, and accurate detection and location of victims, the sens-ing of their condition, and the planning of their rescue or extraction can be signifi- cantly improved. However, these activities fall outside the scope of CIP R&D. Na-tional R&D plans developed by the Emer-gency Preparedness and Response (EP&R) R&D communities address these needs, and incorporate these detection methods with organizational and logistical challenges faced by the first responder community. The CIP research challenges for human and robotic detection and sensor systems, in order to achieve the strategic goals of the COP, secure Internet, and resilient infra- structure, are the integration of these tech-niques with the existing pervasive sensor systems, to provide real-time feeds to analy-sis and modeling efforts (Theme 5: Analy-sis and Decision Support Systems). This larger COP perspective will capture the scope of a terrorist event and analyze the potential for cascading effects across CI sectors associated with various alternative responses. Methods for monitoring and tracking people and robotics within critical infrastructure facilities are within the scope of CIP R&D and are discussed in Theme 3: Entry and Access Portals. f) Intelligent Sensor Systems Intelligent sensor systems are the culmina- tion of the advances already discussed for detection and sensor systems. Intelligent systems will have multiple types of sensors, communication capabilities so they can \"talk\" to each other, and computing capabil- ity so they can perform analyses, compare sensed data and analyses, and learn based on analyses and experience. To be perva-sively deployed, such smart sensors need to be low-cost, durable, accurate, self- calibrating, and environmentally adaptable. The sensors and systems of sensors will need to be \"taught\" to be threat-aware, self-configuring, and self-healing. They may be wired or wireless or a combination of the two - but they must be informationally se- cure. The on-board and system computers will need to have \"reasoning\" and data fusion analysis systems capable of interpreting and integrating spatially and temporally distrib- uted, multi-spectral, and seemingly dispa-rate data. One potential approach is to use these reasoning capabilities while address-ing threats using \"anticipation\" theory, which uses detected patterns to project or anticipate next steps, based on comparisons with archived patterns and profiles. Intelli-gent systems will have data archiving capa-bilities that are designed for increased reli-ability and that are distributed for complete recording and continuous coverage of the system. The design and distributed nature of these systems will ensure no single point of attack can cause failure. These intelligent sensor systems are central to the achievement of the three strategic CIP R&D goals, and pose serious R&D chal- 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 28 lenges. They are needed to realize the COP goal and provide affordable and effective monitoring of the vast scope of critical in- frastructures. They ar e needed to achieve the next generation secure national comput-ing and communications network. This se-cure network will in turn provide the com-munication security needed by intelligent sensor systems for the COP. These systems will enable automated self-diagnosing and self-healing actions in both cyber and physical infrastructure. g) Assessment and Response to an Event Assessment of events based on pervasively deployed intelligent sensor systems that enable effective monitoring of critical infra-structures through the COP are needed at several levels - from hands-on operators caught in an event, first responders and owners who need to make rapid decisions, and government leaders up to executive lev-els who need the ability to assess multiple events across all critical infrastructure sys-tems as they may affect our Nation and re-sult in cascading consequences. There is a need for close collaboration between the Emergency Preparedness and Response (EP&R) and CIP R&D plans and communi-ties to achieve effective levels of speed and precision needed to communicate assess- ment information across these different players in emergency operations. The national R&D plans developed by the EP&R R&D communities will provide the detailed sensing equipment and analysis methods needed for first responders. The role for CIP R&D is to prepare rapid situ- ational assessments for the infrastructure operators caught in the midst of a terrorist or other emergency event, and enable rapid, integrated, and automated responses to mitigate damage and convey actionable in- formation to those involved. Because many attacks move at extremely rapid speeds, especially in the cyber world, there is a need for automated response methods to deal with detected attacks - part of the CIP goal of resilient infrastructure. Few such mechanisms currently exist. Intelligent sensor system s can enable real- time sensing of cyber system status, weather conditions, traffic and road conditions, and available resources and assist their integra- tion into the overall decision-making and response process. The sensor information can feed to a host of analytical models of event progression including: analysis of cyber threats, chemical/biological plumes, radiation clouds, structural collapses, fire propagation, behavioral predictions, and similar analytical processing; population density models; identification of evacuation and emergency response routes and equip- ment needs; damage prediction including cyber, physical, and personnel; and decision making computer algorithms for priority and risk assessments discussed in Theme 5: Analysis and Decision Support Systems. Theme 2- Protection and Prevention Protection and Prevention objectives to support the National Critical Infrastructure Protection Strategic Goals - Examples: National Common Operating Picture for Critical Infrastructure : Minimizing the impact of any threat and feeding the COP with data about real status of assets Inherently Secure Next-Generation Comput- ing and Communications Network : Devis- ing threat mitigation and countermeasures for proactive protection Resilient, Self-Diagnosing, Self-Healing Physical and Cyber Infrastructure Systems : Develop shielding and sacrificial systems to enhance protection and maximize resilience Effective protection of CI involves layers of defensive measures that deny successful attacks by deterring attackers, preventing entry beyond safe perimeters, providing back-up systems, stopping attackers in their tracks, inhibiting the use of weapons, ren- dering the CI elements resistant to these weapons, and using forms of deception to mislead terrorists. 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 29 Prevention and protection measures for physical and cyber CI evolve with each new threat, participant and motivation. As better protective measures are developed, there is a concurrent need to prepare for developing or resorting to other tactics to overcome these measures by terrorists. Critical infrastructure protection and pre- vention R&D involves exploring techniques that would protect against a wide variety of threat tactics, be adaptable to new threats, and/or require the terrorist to expend an in-ordinate amount of time and effort in plan-ning and executing an attack to overcome these measures. The more time and plan- ning required by the terrorists, the more tell-tale signs and patterns they will leave in their tracks, thus increasing the likelihood that intelligence efforts will discover and thwart the attack. Collaboration with intelligence communi- ties and local law enforcement is essential to know beforehand if an attack is likely, to respond quickly and appropriately to alarms and warning signals, and to capture and deal with terrorists who attempt these attacks. More effective and less costly CIP can be achieved if we can develop a completely new way of working together in a collabora-tive leadership mode by sharing unified se- curity systems across the many business and government entities that own and operate CI networks and sub-systems, including inter-national allies. DoD, DOE, and other communities have investigated many kinds of threat and vul- nerability, and developed significant depth and breadth of relevant expertise. Threats can come from the air, on land, on the wa-ter, underwater, underground, and via cyber routes. Robust yet affordable protection will need to be developed to include all these avenues of attack in addition to the wide variety of types of structural links, nodes and system elements that form CI. Understanding the vulnerabilities of the critical infrastructures, and identifying and validating the threats to those CI networks, involves the use of in-depth knowledge about each CI network, the systems of as-sets of which they are comprised, and the interconnectivity of assets that are shared across multiple sectors, such as the interde-pendence of all sectors on energy and com-munications. Threats against physical infrastructure and assets include: high explosive blast, projec- tile, and fire damage; chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear attacks; physical assaults and intrusions; and failures caused by natural disasters, accidents, and other emergencies. The cyber infrastructure is threatened by: infiltration of a network from the outside; exfiltration, disclosure, exposure, or corrup-tion of stored data, or rendering stored data inaccessible; interception, interruption or redirection of data flows or communica- tions; malicious (untrusted) software agents; compromised (trusted) software applica-tions or hardware components; local or widespread disruption of services; and compromised or usurped (hijacked) ma- chines. Within the Protection and Prevention Theme, the following general categories will be addressed: Intrusion Blast Debris and Fragments Projectiles Fire Electromagnetic, Laser, and Particle Beam Weapons Disruption and Denial of Ser- vice/Access Small Arms Gaseous and Aerosol Plumes 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 30 Exfiltration of, Tampering with, the Destruction of, or the Monitoring of Data Water Focus Areas for Protection and Prevention a) Intrusion The oldest form of defense, and usually the first line of defense - perimeter and portal protection and obstacles against intruders - is continually evolving as access tactics and technology change and new materials, equipment, concepts and design tools are developed. Protection against physical and cyber intrusion is central to the scope of CIP R&D. Intrusion is not only unauthor- ized entry into physical facilities, but also into computer networks and information systems. Intruders can be individuals, small groups, coordinated teams with sophisti-cated weaponry, intelligent software agents, automated and unmanned intruders such as robots, unauthorized employees or ex-employees, or relatively innocent trespass-ers. Intruders can have a variety of objec-tives including simple display of the ability to enter, vandalism, theft, damage or de- struction, or to actually inflict casualties. To accomplish the strategic goal of resilient infrastructure, CIP R&D challenges for pro-tection against intrusion involve denying access and stopping intruders in their tracks, developing protective methods that adapt to changing threats so they are economically and operationally sustainable, and develop-ing measures that work with detection sys-tems for rapid automated security responses by elements within the infrastructure. In addition to thwarting intruder ingenuity, there are challenges to develop protective measures that are sustainable, aesthetically acceptable, and have low life-cycle costs. The protection measures typically should have dual use, such as improved protection against fire, earthquakes, deterioration, and other hazards, and continued operation even if there is a power outage, or extreme weather conditions, so that they are eco- nomically viable to implement. To achieve the envisioned secure communi- cations network, CIP is challenged to de- velop effective protection against cyber in-truders such as intelligent software agents that can quarantine and disable software intruders. Protection from cyber intrusion is a challenge due to the rapidly evolving na- ture of computer systems, the increased ap- plication of computer-based technologies, and the ever-increasing sophistication of intruders and insiders. Within the vast array of legacy, current, and planned systems there are weaknesses that can be accessed by cyber intruders ranging from novices to professionals. CIP R&D is challenged to develop tech- nologies that can prevent or disable intrud- ers, and pass this information on to the COP. Distinguishing and dealing appropri-ately with the casual intruder versus truly malevolent entities is a challenge. The dif-ferences in their motivations to attack and how lethal they could become may provide clues to the ways in which we can protect against them. Physical traps and non-lethal forms of capture and disablement are evolv-ing that could be deployed in situations where the use of lethal technologies is inap- propriate. b) Blast Blast effects, such as air blast, heat, and ground shock, from different explosive sources are basically similar, differing mainly in intensity with the type and amount of explosive involved. The inten- sity generally decreases in inverse propor-tion to the cube root of distance from the detonation point, except for special cases, such as long, linear charges (in pipes, for example), or shaped charges, which can concentrate the blast and focus a more lethal projectile in a single direction. Tamping, which is covering the explosive with a mass of material such as water or soil, can sig-nificantly increase the damage caused by a blast. 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 31 A wide variety of techniques have been used to provide some protection against blast, such as hardened reinforced concrete buildings, blast-resistant panels and win- dows, barrier walls, layers of crushable ma-terials, shock isolation systems, spray-on elastomeric polymers for retrofit of conven-tional masonry walls, films and curtains for retrofitting windows, and emerging new materials and design components. Thermobaric weapons are another family of blast types. Thermobarics were developed to generate very high levels of heat and an extended duration of a high-pressure blast wave for military use in confined spaces such as tunnels and underground com-plexes. These weapons contain highly en-ergetic explosive materials that are en-hanced with additional aluminum and mag- nesium. Once fired, the energetic particles continue to bounce against the walls of the confined space, burn and generate heat and pressure. The CIP R&D for blast protection contrib- utes to realizing all three of our strategic goals. The presence of protective measures in certain CI locations provides the COP with information about expected perform-ance in upgraded zones and can direct atten-tion to more vulnerable locations. Blast protection can prevent successful attempts to damage key nodes essential to continued full operation of the future secure comput-ing and communications network. Explosives continue to be the terrorists' tool of choice. Continued R&D to safely and cost-effectively protect CI from blast threats supports the CIP strategic goal of resilient, self-healing critical infrastructure. Effective blast protection can minimize downtime for repairs or render the infrastructure elements immune. The CIP R&D emphasis needs to be on development of self-healing designs and development of advanced materials that can deform and absorb energy and deflect the high blast loads and temperatures while maintaining their structural integrity. c) Debris and Fragments Airborne fragments and debris are secon- dary hazards produced by man-made explo- sions, the collapse of structures, large fires, and volcanic eruptions. Fragments are metal pieces that originally surround the explosive, such as the casing of a military bomb or artillery round, or the body, engine parts, etc., of a vehicle bomb, or nails and other types of scrap metal surrounding the explosives in the vest of a suicide bomber. They are ejected at very high velocities and can travel 1,000 feet or more. Because of their high velocity, high density, and sharp edges, they are capable of cutting cables and steel beams, concrete reinforcement, and producing casualties over a wide area. Debris includes many materials, such as concrete, bricks, metal, glass, wood, ash, soil, or other particles, that are impacted and set into motion by a blast wave. In most cases, high-velocity fragments and debris are the greatest cause of casualties and secondary damage from accidental ex-plosions. However, low-velocity debris, including that from collapse of a damaged building, poses significant problems for the For example: The debris from a building sub- jected to either an intern al or an external explo- sion may only travel a short distance and form a pile, or it may be accelerated to high velocities and cause extensive casualties or secondary damage upon impact with interior structural components, other buildings, vehicles, and people, over a wide area. rescue of survivors who may be trapped or buried by the debris. The debris concerns may be further exacerbated if the building has been contaminated with chemical or biological weapons, and must be safely de-molished and removed. Fine airborne debris particles can make it difficult for people to breathe, and may have long-lasting and damaging health con- sequences. These fine particulates can clog 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 32 air intake filters and damage heating and air conditioning systems in various CI elements where ventilation is critical to continued operations, such as underground transporta- tion facilities and hospitals. CIP R&D challenges for protecting against fragments and debris follow from the blast mitigation R&D areas. New materials and new designs will prevent structures from becoming high velocity fragments. These advances matured to practical, cost effective levels will enable the construction of far more resilient critical infrastructure compo-nents in the future. d) Projectiles Projectiles and fragmentation weapons can include bullets, mortars, rockets, improvised explosive devices, air-delivered bombs and artillery rounds. The projectiles can be solid, or they can contain explosives, sub- munitions, or contaminating materials. Bombers use nuts, bolts, screws, nails, etc. as projectiles. DoD conducts research in-vestigating the penetration of these weapons and the fragments that are created by their detonation into a wide variety of materials including soil, rock, concrete and other structural elements. Most current research efforts are aimed at understanding the penetration of these pro- jectiles and fragments from a military point- of-view. The research is aimed at providing protection to military personnel and equip- ment at installations and base camps, and also for development of precision offensive weapons to \"surgically\" attack certain loca- tions within a building to limit collateral damage and loss of life. The propagation and availability of military and improvised munitions has greatly in-creased the need for developing approaches to prevent their use against critical infra- structures. Possible CI network targets could include oil refineries, large industrial complexes, buildings that house key com-munication nodes and relay centers, office buildings, power plants, power transmission systems, pipelines and utilities, bridges, and dams. The more likely projectile attack scenario would involve weapons that are man-portable or that could be affixed to non-military vehicles. These would include small rockets, mortars, some artillery rounds, and small arms. Current protection technologies are rela- tively primitive and involve layers of mate- rials to \"trick\" the firing mechanism of the weapon into going off before it comes in direct contact with the actual target, and combining strong panels to reflect the blast force with materials that can deform and absorb the blast energy. Practical, effective protection against projectiles is a technol-ogy gap in our current knowledge arsenal of protection measures. Further R&D is needed on this topic to achieve strategic goal of achieving resilient, self-healing CI. e) Fire Although a great deal is known about fire protection and fire fighting, further ad-vances must address the complexity of fire and make those technological advances cost-effective. Fire often follows other at- tacks such as blast, nuclear, and some chemical events. Fire drains resources - people, equipment and supplies - and the deployment of these resources can leave other sectors less secure. Unfortunately, arson is easy and does not require advanced technology. A coordinated attack by a small army of arsonists could wreak havoc on a community and completely drain water supplies needed to ex tinguish it, especially if those water supply networks were also attacked. Unchecked, fire creates chaos and a potentially large number of victims and displaced persons who may be severely harmed or killed by burns and toxic fumes. While technology advances have improved the detection of fires and the fire resistance of many materials, the increased use of syn-thetic and other highly flammable materials in daily living environments has actually decreased the average time a person can safely evacuate a fire scene once fire detec- 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 33 tion devices sound an alarm. These factors have contributed to the need to 1) better understand the physical and chemical com- plexity of fire, and 2) develop new ap- proaches that limit the growth, spread, and effects of fire in our environment. Traditionally, prevention of and protection against fire has been obtained by applying a combination of the following strategies: the use of non-combustible construction mate- rials and less flammable building products; the installation of automatic fire detection and suppression systems; compartmentalize space to reduce fire sp read; sufficient egress capabilities; clear accessibility for fire- fighting operations; and, emergency training for first responders and building occupants. Research over the past thirty years has had a significant impact on improving the effec- tiveness of each of these strategies; how- ever, environmental concerns have imposed serious constraints on some of our most ef-fective firefighting chemicals. Other areas such as strategies for wildland / urban fires still represent serious challenges on how to most effectively control these types of natu- rally occurring and man-made disasters. Methods and tools are now needed to deal with fires in critical assets including spe-cialized material handling, hazardous mate- rial management, and management of facili- ties where fire itself is not the danger, but rather the contaminants that may be re-leased into the air because of the fire. This requires the advanced practical application of thermodynamics and gas-fluid flow of heat and fumes to develop optimal layout and control of infrastructure Heating, Venti-lation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) com-ponents, facility usage, and firebreak meas-ures to minimize vulnerability to fire and airborne threats. An examination of meth- ods, tools, and plans to deal with these kinds of fires, and the development of simu-lation and analysis tools is needed. Current research and development needs related to prevention and suppression of fire include new more effective fire-resistant materials, fire-resistant designs for new structures based on improved fire prediction models, and retrofit approaches for existing infrastructures. This will provide the tech- nical basis needed to develop and imple- ment performance-based fire codes and standards, and technology and practices that explicitly include structural fire loads in the design of new structures and the retrofit of existing structures. Fire sensor information and information from other building con- trols are needed for greater situational awareness in emergency response decisions and to aid in rerouting egress paths based on environmental conditions. Sensors installed in buildings or carried into the building by responders provide a continuous flow of information about conditions in the threat-ened structure. The use of sensor and con-trol infrastructures to monitor, report, and respond to events forms a key element to realizing the CIP R&D goal of establishing a national common operating picture. f) Electromagnetic, Laser, and Particle Beam Weapons New classes of weapons are emerging that involve directed energy. Electromagnetic (EM) shock wave, EM pulsed and continu-ous wave, and particle beam, laser, x-ray, and gamma-ray weapons are under devel-opment. These weapons can interfere with and destroy sensitive electronics. The sci- ence and creation of some of these devices are well within the capabilities of terrorists. These weapons can unleash very wide-spread damage or very accurate surgical damage with a very limited investment. These weapons have the potential of being used selectively and intermittently, and can be disguised as ordinary objects ranging in size from a briefcase to a delivery truck. Most detection measures have little to no experience in spotting such weapons or the key elements that go into developing them. Protection against these weapons involves not only purposeful hardening against the effects of such weapons, but also the devel-opment of new recognition and intent detec- tion profiles. 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 34 The creation of resilience in control and management systems required to resist and survive such attacks is a CIP R&D concern. To achieve the strategic goal of self-healing, self sustaining CI networks, automated re-sponses to electromagnetic disturbance, la-ser, and particle beam weapons will need to suppress, divert, redirect, re-profile and oth-erwise \"morph\" the attacked system into a form that can survive the event, stay as strong as possible, and return itself to as close to original form as possible. g) Disruption and Denial of Service / Access Overwhelming a process by forcibly insert- ing tasks, dramatically increasing demands on a system, or denying availability of needed resources such as communication systems or water for fire fighting can result in serious consequences. These actions can divert attention, consume resources, and displace capability making other portions of both physical and cyber critical infrastruc-ture systems more vulnerable. Disruption and denial of service results in making re- sources unavailable to the people who need them, when they need them. In keeping with the CIP strategic goal of resilient and self-healing CI, protection from these attempts at disruption involves: Ensuring that protective identifica- tion, confirmation and authorization access measures are rigorous and well managed Providing redundancy, re-routing options, and self-healing or self-sustaining attributes to rapidly re- store or at least provide a minimum level of service until recovery ac-tions can be implemented for both cyber and physical systems Having procedures in place to mini- mize shifting of vulnerability by di-verting detection systems, security and law enforcement personnel, and response teams to less optimal con-figurations, thus leaving certain lo- cations less well protected In physical and cyber worlds, frequent and increasing threat to the use of existing sys- tems is an experienced and known event. Methods for mitigation and prevention of disruption and denial constantly chase the techniques of those who constitute a threat. However, the basic science and technology for existing, and near-term threats are known. The protection tools in this area are either available or are currently being de-veloped. h) Small Arms Small arms range from hand-held knives to direct and indirect fire weapons, including military and high power rifles, rocket pro-pelled grenades, and mortars. The latter can be used to attack security forces, assassinate CI leaders and operators, hold people hos- tage, and destroy key, fragile components of the physical infrastructure, and disable de-vices in the security system itself. These weapons can easily create havoc if applied against CI nodes and extensive, vulnerable CI links. Small arms can be used as a type of remote event that selectively damages or triggers existing security measures to set off alarms so that attackers can observe re-sponse times and examine overall design and weaknesses of the security measures. CIP operational and R&D concerns involve protection against these weapons including denying projectile weapon access, interrupt-ing line of sight, physical hardening or ar-moring of people and physical targets, and deception, which is misleading the attacker as to the actual location, presence, or iden-tity of the target. The attackers may be on the ground, underground, on the water, un-derwater, in the air, or in a combination of these avenues of attack. These CIP R&D efforts help achieve the strategic goal of resilient and self-healing infrastructure. 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 35 i) Gaseous and Aerosol Plumes The release of harmful contaminants of al- most every kind has been considered and researched by federal laboratories, contrac- tors and universities for both open air and inside building venues. Since WWI, mili-tary groups have compiled information on the behavior and mitigation of the residual materials from chemical, biological and ra- diological variants of all major dangerous gases and aerosols. Dispersion analyses have been conducted for all major catego-ries of these types of threats, and protective measures have been identified for all com- mercial and public domains and areas. Once a contaminant release has occurred, protection procedures include capture, fil-tration, diversion, deactivation and disasso-ciation - breaking up the contaminant mole- cules. These stages of protection and re- sponse involve well-known processes, have fairly manageable costs, and are commer-cially available. A strong body of knowl-edge on some of the more obscure or re-cently developed contaminants is not yet available, nor does there exist much infor- mation about their basic physical properties, nor their effects and behavior in physical infrastructure systems. A more complete collection of these properties must be as- sembled in support of the resilient CIP R&D strategic goal. j) Exfiltration of, Tampering with, the Destruction of, or the Monitoring of Data In digital systems, the undetected damage by removal, change or addition of informa- tion to pre-structured information regimes including databases, directories, files, and images is a danger requiring protections. Two key issues apply: the first is the many methods by which this might be done, and the second is the lack of understanding about how easy or difficult it is to accom-plish such acts on commercial and proprie-tary products on which government and in-dustry depend. In sectors such as banking and finance, much has been done to consider some of these issues. However, in digital control systems (such as SCADA), facilities man- agement, and other asset domains, there was previously little effort expended or thought given to what is now a current threat. Prod-ucts were presumed to be handled only by trusted personnel, but we cannot assume this is the case today. The challenge for CIP R&D is to assure the development of effective protective meas-ures so that the secure national computing and communications network can be estab- lished, and to provide ways of immediately restoring a critical information system if it has been attacked, or enabling the system to self-diagnose problems and self-heal with a minimum loss of service. This will involve the development of completely new soft- ware and hardware architectures discussed in Theme 8: Advanced Infrastructure Ar-chitecture and Systems Design and rigorous enforcement of protections against cyber intruders discussed in Theme 3: Entry and Access Portals. k) Water Our Nation has substantial water resources that provide safe drinking water, water for industrial and agricultural uses, water for sanitation in urban communities, and other uses. Attacks on drinking water are a con-cern addressed specifically in R&D plans for dealing with chemical, biological and radiological attacks. These plans are to identify the contaminant, have science- based means of modeling how it will be modified, dispersed, and diluted in the wa-ter system, and determine how to decon-taminate and mitigate public health conse-quences if an attack does occur. Although such attacks on large water sup- plies are disturbing concerns, the effects of dilution make it very difficult to achieve widespread loss of life by such means. For this practical reason, homeland security R&D is focused on protection of treated drinking water, where introduction of con- 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 36 centrated contaminants in distribution lines after treatment can have more severe public health effects. In addition to the detection and decontami- nation R&D provided by other government and commercial research communities, pro-tection of drinking water distribution lines as they exit treatment facilities and pumping plants involves preventing access by unau- thorized persons, blast mitigation, and de- veloping inherently secure control systems such as SCADA systems to prevent cyber attacks that can have a physical result. The water distribution systems of the future may have built-in smart sensors to monitor water quality, and automatically report alarms and engage steps to mitigate effects of contaminants in the system. With ad-vances in materials science there may be new ways to remove, render inactive, or re- line distribution systems if the physical in-frastructure itself becomes contaminated. These advances will help us achieve the three CIP strategic goals. For CIP R&D, water is a concern as a po- tential weapon of mass destruction in the form of large reservoirs upstream of urban areas and other water control structures, especially in times of flood when these structures, such as levees and pumping plants, are severely stressed. Unfortunately, catastrophic losses from flooding of our communities occurs some-where in the US at least once a decade. The likelihood of greater damage from this oc-currence is increasing as major population shifts to littoral and coastal areas. Large bodies of water held upstream from urban areas are potential weapons for terrorists. The damage that could occur includes se- vere erosion, deposition of large quantities of sediment, destruction associated with contaminated floodwaters and consequent human suffering, economic business losses, and laborious, costly cleanup of hazardous material. The economic losses and cost of recovery from sudden failure or removal of high hazard dams would be severe. Costs and disruption associated with interruption of water supply, water and wastewater treatment, and waterborne commerce are also high. The majority of large dams in the United States have been built over the last 100 years. The design technology has varied considerably over that time, and the struc- tures themselves are unique. Thus, dam vulnerability varies between types of dams and the level of technology that was used. Because of their large mass, certain types of dams are not susceptible to catastrophic failure from terrorist attack or other haz- ards; however, other components, such as spillway gates and power generation facili-ties may be vulnerable. Dams may be par-ticularly open to land and waterside attack and current security and military technolo- gies can be adapted to provide protection. In keeping with the CIP strategic goal of resilient, self-healing infrastructure, many current state-of-the-art large dams are de-signed to have self-healing or sacrificial zones to prevent catastrophic release of the reservoir. These design concepts can also be used for security upgrades. The R&D challenges for CIP are to advance hardening techniques for dams to protect against blast or other attacks on dam crests, lock and spillway gates, and hydropower facilities. Novel emergency measures are needed to stop or divert water under high flow condi-tions. The COP and pervasive instrumenta-tion of these facilities with intelligent sen- sors systems will provide the greater per- spective needed to pe rvasively monitor the condition of dams, locks and their compo-nents, and river control structures. Ad-vances to secure SCADA control systems are needed, including new, emerging mate- rials for blast resistance. Theme 3 - Entry and Access Portals Security of entry portals and access to assets to support the National Critical Infrastruc- ture Protection Strategic Goals - Examples: 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 37 National Common Operating Picture for Critical Infrastructure : Knowing who is where, their roles and permissions and what they may carry Inherently Secure Next-Generation Com- puting and Communications Network : Ad- vanced biometrics, examination of actions, history, roles, and profiles Resilient, Self-Diagnosing, Self-Healing Physical and Cyber Infrastructure Systems : Creating systems that inherently learn, vali-date, mutate, and become better at recogni-tion and control The physical and virtual doorways into the country and its critical infrastructure have taken on much greater importance with re-gard to homeland security, protection, and defense since September 11, 2001. The objects that pass through the Nation's many portals on a daily basis include people, ve- hicles, goods, cargo and freight, electronic information, and communications. Ade-quately protecting critical infrastructure at the point of entry of people, materials, and information is a tremendous undertaking considering the wide variety of physical and electronic items that must be screened and in light of the variety of threats that may be present. Entry and access portals are evolving from standard physical entryways (e.g., guarded doors, gates, airport screening areas, etc.) to complicated communication portals that may involve biometric identifiers, radio fre-quency (RF) tags, sensor data, and inte-grated information for automated analysis and decision support. Portal security will require robust and predictable operations under a variety of environmental conditions that provide identification and authentica-tion of the people, materials, and informa- tion that pass through them. Cyber portals for the exchange of critical data and information will require widely available and technologically advanced pro-tections that are well beyond the basic password systems commonly used today. They also will require adaptation to attacks that are continuously changing and evolv-ing. Emerging security issues will require that physical portals (entryways, check- points) and cyber portals (network access, secure transmissions) manage increasingly similar scopes of information, to include accurate identification, authentication, data protection, and information exchange re- garding people, material, or information. Future needs of both physical portals and cyber portals can benefit from similar ongo-ing applied R&D approaches, communica-tion standards development, and engineer- ing requirements. The focus of the Entry and Access Portals Theme is the technology necessary for suc-cessful and robust protection of critical ac-cess portals, both physical and cyber: Identification Authentication Authorization Access Control Tracking Dynamic Situational Control Each of these topics represents an area of active commercial development and funda-mental research, but the current state of these interrelated technologies is limited for most entry and access portal scenarios. For example, there are many biometric identifi- cation systems being researched, or indeed on the market already, but persistent issues continue with these systems regarding reli-ability and performance, integration into a security system, and known approaches to circumvention. The pervasive lack of sufficient standards for security hardened hardware and tamper-proof designs and for maintaining and communicating sensor data coupled with inconsistent methods for accurately charac- terizing the performance of these systems 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 38 are also common deficiencies impeding broad-based adoption. Focus Areas for Entry and Access Portals a) Identification Identification refers to the process of recog- nizing an individual or object from a known population. When referring to identification within a physical or cyber portal, we refer to the system's ability to recognize a person or object by comparing a measurement, or multiple measurements, with a previously acquired record in a database. Fingerprints are an obvious example. An identification system would be used, for example, in a video forensics environment where an indi-vidual's facial characteristics or fingerprints are compared to a criminal or terrorist data-base. An identification system uses a one- to-many comparison since the measured identifier must be compared to some or all of the records in the database to determine potential membership within the population. Physical and behavioral measurements or characteristics are known as biometric iden- tifiers . Physical measurements include fin- gerprints, hand and finger geometry, facial features, vasculature structure of the retina, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and speech characteristics. Behavioral characteristics are acquired traits that can be discerned from a person's written signature, human gait, the input of keyboard strokes on a computer system, or the way in which a person speaks. Development of computer modeling systems to incorporate as many or all of these traits as possible to strengthen identification systems and eliminate poten-tial loopholes for easy access or cyber 'back door' entries at different portals are needed. Research and development should also fo- cus on the effectiveness of systems requir- ing a series of random biometric identifiers for each access attempt to reduce the possi-bility of unauthorized access. Vehicles, goods and materials also require identification. The broad use of radio fre-quency identification (RFID) and similar transponder systems for identifying vehicles at tollbooths and managing inventories in warehouses could easily be expanded to automated law enforcement and tracking activities. Research and development should focus on how the next generation of wireless communications and tower triangu-lation systems (system of surveying several measurement points to confirm the location of a signal) could help eliminate techno-logical barriers to this tracking capability. Many examples of such technologies exist, but they cannot achieve the strategic goals of this plan without substantial additional R&D. Identification technology must be dramatically more accurate, faster, more broadly affordable, and based around new types of standards which also need to be developed. Methods mu st be developed to evaluate these technologies to ensure high performance and accurate characterization of information. The required R&D must not only address the identification of people, but also proc- esses, objects, intelligent devices, and autonomous software agents - each of these can be an active participant in infrastructure functions. This R&D will contribute to the strength of the COP, the security of the next national Internet and provide the inherent basis of resilience for complex systems. b) Authentication A verification system is used to authenticate a person's identity or the identity of an ob-ject by comparing a measurement with a previously acquired record that is main- tained in a database. The goal is to deter-mine whether the person or object is who or what they claim to be. The use of a pin number or password to enter a computer banking system is an example. Another example is providing an address, date of birth, or social security number when per-forming a credit card transaction over the phone. A verification system is a one-to-one comparison (i.e., in contrast to the iden- tification system which is one-to-many), 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 39 since the subject is confirming his/her/its identity, through the use of a single data-base record particular to the subject. This differs from identification in which a person or object is compared to a population of information to determine membership in a group. Credit card fraud and identity theft (physical and cyber) are just two examples of a growing industry of falsifying authenti- cation. Authentication for individuals involves in- dependent confirmation of identity using one or more methods. Typically, multi-factor approaches provide greater security than single factor methods. These might be retinal scans, DNA, fingerprints, voice-prints, etc. From a CIP standpoint, goods authentication is not an issue unless authen-tication of the goods is tied to the introduc- tion of materials or devices that could cause danger to infrastructure function. Cargo authentication is necessary for port and multi-modal control. Verification of contents is the critical issue, while reducing delays. Different cargo identification meth- ods such as serial number identification and chemical composition could be applied si-multaneously to allow authentication. This is the only alternative at this time unless cargo is fully sealed at origin and tamper- proof. Signal authentication is a serious issue to- day and will become even more so as wire-less technologies become more prevalent and widely used. DoD has been addressing these issues in new communications efforts. The principal objectives of signal authenti- cation that apply here are the ability to au-thenticate a person, a weapon, a munition, a communication, a connection, a message, or a locale. The strategic goals of this plan are depend- ent on development of much more advanced forms of authentication than are commonly used in the private sector. Many of these are already in use in the DoD, but in forms and at cost levels that are not acceptable or maintainable in commercial settings. The COP is absolutely dependent on the quality and accuracy of information gathered and analyzed. Authentication is critical to en- sure these feeds are not disrupted or cor- rupted. As stated above, the COP depends on the successful creation of the second goal of a secure national Internet where au-thentication of people, processes and soft-ware entities must be improved from cur- rent abilities. c) Authorization Authorization in a physical context is the granting or confirmation of authority to per-form a task or to be in some specific place. Having a physical token such as a key is an example. It may also come as a real-time affirmation done remotely in response to a request or action. An example of the first form, \"authorization in a physical context,\" is a transport authorization to take goods across our national border. The second form, \"real-time affirmation done re-motely,\" involves permission being com-municated when demanded by controlling authorities at the portal. From a security standpoint, there are few technologies used in the first form, although electronic access cards that are renewed with each shipment and erased at delivery points are an example of a technology. The second form involves a combination of identification and authentication by an au-thorizing entity. This could be carried by the shipment holder or the authorization might come only after arrival, or following an inspection upon arrival, at a portal point. This could involve not only identity confir- mation, but also verification of cargo quan-tity and make-up before authorization is given. In the cyber world, authorization is a more significant issue because the contexts are more numerous. A password can be con-sidered a form of authorization if it is issued by a higher level authority. If embedded in a form of identification such as a smart card, a password can be considered an added form of authentication. 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 40 One particular area that will require new R&D to support future authorization ap-proaches involves the use of software agents. Software agents are typically de- fined as computational entities having autonomous operation and collaborative abilities. They are adaptive and may at some point exhibit intelligence (i.e., the ability to infer and execute needed actions, and seek and incorporate relevant informa- tion given pre-specified goals and objec-tives). Software agents differ from conven-tional software in that they are intended to be assistants to the user in contrast to con- ventional software tools that are simply re- active. Authorization is a key skill for the systems that make up the COP. It will be used in a variety of ways already described, but its higher contribution involves setting the stage for dynamic adjustment of viewing, access, level of control, level of authority to change, and much more tied to the role of human users and other agents. Authoriza-tion methods allow adjustment of roles based on success, stability, consistency and other actor metrics designed to ensure role retraction is possible in cases of confused or disabled users or agents. d) Access Control The concept of access control to prevent forcible physical access is one form of pro-tection from intrusion, which is discussed in Theme 2: Protection and Prevention. Lev-els of access control in highly secure situa-tions logically involve using more than one capability or technology. For cyber portals, allowing or denying ac- cess is the goal of all efforts related to iden-tification, authorization, and authentication. That access may be to a place, a system, a device, a network, a data transmission or receipt, etc. In the context of CIP, the tools and technologies required for almost all of these types of access are reasonably mature and available for people to use to gain ac-cess. However, when systems begin to use intelligent devices and software agents to assist in the identification, authentication, and authorization process, the problems of trusted forms of these entities are critical. A great deal of research has been accom- plished (including the work done by DOE, DoD, and NSF) and the technology has been commercialized, but gaps still remain. We must anticipate future attacks and have security in place before broad use of next generation systems are implemented. Gaps need to be more explicitly identified and solved. The COP and the supporting secure Internet will require new forms of access control since the network will contain autonomous software entities working with intelligent devices in a synergistic manner. Depending on what these entities are addressing, access control will become adjustable rather than a binary function and excursions in that ad- justment may be allowed to extend beyond normal limits in order to understand the ac-tions of such agents that appear to be inap-propriate. In other words, access may ap-pear to have been allowed when it will ac- tually be controlled just to see what liberties the agents may attempt. e) Tracking Tracking from one entry point to and through another or from one virtual point to another, whether physically or in a data network system, involves a variety of tech-nologies. With the recent explosion of loca-tion-based services, the capability to physi-cally track people and the devices they carry is improving rapidly. The tracking of vehi- cles, containers or packages is proceeding rapidly. Single packag es, animals, and even food are acquiring e-tags that not only allow location, but also stops in-transit and tam-pering to be monitored. The actual software of tracking of items has a very small R&D component. Implementing these tracking devices and updating systems to accommo-date these devices is the main focus for some companies. 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 41 The more significant R&D effort will in- volve how to modify present approaches to add encryption and security elements not currently addressed. Other R&D focus will include improving already existing identifi-cation, authentication, authorization, access control, and tracking technologies primarily in lowering the false positive rate. The COP requires a strong tracking element for almost anything that can be modified into a threat platform. Suspect users or agents require tracking without detection. These technologies have not been pursued in the past for both technical and legal reasons. Research is required to enable this capabil- ity to the degree needed for a complete COP. f) Dynamic Situational Control This focus area relates to the ability of a portal system to infer actions or intent and potentially control or direct the outcome of a given security situation. This may mean the presentation of relevant information to a human security screener, the denial of ac-cess or service associated with a cyber sys- tem, or the re-direction of people, goods, and emergency services. A portal or entry system should be able to process data about individuals, cargo or goods, access the as-sociated history and current context associ- ated with the situation, and perform useful control actions. Facilitating effective situational control, which is a critical capability for entry and access portals, will cut across all of these focus topics and includes the evolving abil- ity to reliably determine human behavior, essentially qualitative in nature, from quan-titative measurements - a very basic re-search endeavor today. Dynamic situational control requires access to, and integration of, multiple sources of data. Identification, tracking, and dynamic con- trol are fundamental to the decision-making process whether that decision is being made by a human screener of the data, a local por-tal cyber system, or an autonomous soft- ware agent that is designed to identify emerging security situations across many portal systems. (Dynamic control is the ability to integrate and act on the multiple streams of data collected from people, ob- jects, detectors, and a variety of data sys-tems, such as freight tracking data, airline passenger manifests, Interpol, FBI, local police records, financial information, etc.) Data are the keys to the successful function- ing of these systems, and adequate access to these data by security portal technology does not exist today. This focus area is fundamental to the COP, secure Internet, and inherently resilient, self-healing, self-diagnosing strategic goals of this plan. Almost all current control sys-tems are based on relatively static models of how designers expect systems to behave and have well-established paths to take with any anticipated upset or emergency condi- tion. Almost no infrastructure has been de-signed to withstand overt attacks outside DoD and some other sensitive installations, and even these have been designed prior to the introduction of new generation systems, sensors, intelligent devices and advanced control systems. With these new tools, it is possible for a system to sense itself, its en-vironment, its supervision status, subordi-nate goals and more, so that partial opera- tion, limited support or some mechanism for continued delivery of service are possible even if severely damaged. This is a key part of resiliency and self-healing, namely sustaining as much of an infrastructure as possible and providing decision-makers looking into the COP with an idea of what they have available as continuing resources after an event. Theme 4 - Insider Threats Insider threat R&D as it supports the Na-tional Critical Infrastructure Protection Stra-tegic Goals - Examples: National Common Operating Picture for Critical Infrastructure: Sense rogue behav- ior in a trusted resource or anticipate that they may be a candidate threat 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 42 Inherently Secure Next-Generation Comput- ing and Communications Network: Make dynamic job-specific access controls and virtual / background control intrinsic parts of next generation Resilient, Self-Diagnosing, Self-Healing Physical and Cyber Infrastructure Systems: Provide graceful stealth to maneuver a threat actor to show full intentions while maintaining real asset integrity One of the greatest threats to CI networks of nodes and links today is from the insider who performs actions that could destroy or degrade these systems and services. Insider threats originate from individuals or groups of people who have authorized physical or electronic access to information and infra-structure resources. These threats are among the most disturbing and difficult to guard against because potential insider threats are already insi de our infrastructure, and worse, in our area of trust. Thus the threats require that we presume any insider could conduct unauthorized or rogue activi-ties. These individuals and groups are op- portunists who exploit vulnerabilities by choosing the time, place, and method of attack according to perceived weaknesses. There is a fine line in depicting an individ- ual's actions or behaviors as that of an in- sider threat. On one hand, if accusations are true, a significant threat has been stopped; on the other hand, if the accusations are false, there are potential legal ramifications including libel and character defamation. Understanding and abiding by privacy laws and civil boundaries when considering an individual to be an insider threat will reduce the risk of legal actions. All aspects of pro-filing, investigating, and analyzing potential insider threats must conform to the provi- sions of the USA PATRIOT ACT (Public Law 107-56). The Insider Threats Theme will discuss three focus areas for R&D that apply to both information-based and physical insider threats against CI networks and compo- nents: Intent Detection and Monitoring Protection and Prevention These R&D focus areas link intelligence gathering capabilities to identify, measure, and verify threats. Focus Areas for Insider Threats a) Intent Intent detection involves examining combi- nations of observations, actions, relation-ships, and past history in order to accurately sense whether a person, group, or series of events might be the purveyor of, or precur-sor to, terrorist events. This type of detec- tion involves the complex integration of surveillance, profiling, cataloging, compari-son, pattern recognition, and significant computational analysis. All of these activi-ties should be connected to real-time intelli- gence streams and will require human and systems behavior knowledge from the social and behavioral R&D communities. Though the methods of observation in the physical and cyber domains are signifi-cantly different, once the data collection is accomplished, many of the examination, comparison, and analysis activities are simi-lar. There are opportunities to bring to-gether both physical and cyber forms of intent detection with multi-disciplinary knowledge profiling in new and unique ways. Also folded into this focus area are sensors that can accurately determine a person's physiological and behavioral state. If the integrated information described above leads to likelihood of \"intent,\" then the rapid deployment of psychologically- cou-pled with physiologically-oriented sensors could assist in corroborating the intent. There are Social, Behavioral, and Economic R&D plans being developed along these lines. CIP looks to these efforts to develop the behavioral knowledge base and indica- 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 43 tors needed to apply sensing technologies to determination of intent. To realize the strategic goals of the COP, secure Internet, and resilient infrastructure, the CIP research challenges for intent detec-tion are the integration of these intent sen-sors and analytical methods with the whole array of sensor systems being developed, feeding intent interpretation information to access control systems and the COP for situational awareness (such as the detection of potentially damaging activities by an in-sider, discussed in Theme 4: Insider Threats). These can also be used to auto- matically trigger or recommend appropriate protective response measures (such as changing authorization and access levels in cyber systems as discussed in Theme 3: Security of Entry Portals and Access to As- sets). b) Detection and Monitoring The detection of insider threats cannot start after the threat materializes but must draw attention to early recognition of a pattern of action that is erratic or uncharacteristic for an event. Monitoring and profiling in the cyber domain is similar to that of the physi-cal domain, although the level of effort is much greater and the performance of these actions must be done at very high speed. In the cyber context, temporary withdrawal of authority, delaying of actions with inserted validation steps or other functions are needed. This form of collapsing authority and dynamic role changing has yet to be developed. To accomplish the strategic goals of the COP, secure Internet, and resilient infra-structure, the CIP research challenges for detection and monitoring are in conjunction with social, behavioral, and economic R&D, developing computer models that can distinguish between random behavior and behavior indicative of an internal threat. Independent of rogue be havior of a trusted user of the COP, the sophisticated technol-ogy inherent in the COP will require sup- porting systems that watch behavior of peo-ple and systems to spot excursions outside expected actions. These may be a problem or just poor judgment, but they will occur at speeds faster than manual monitoring can address and will have cascading conse-quences far broader than simple observation or intuition could reveal. This requires new methods for building and learning from op-erational, user and event profiles to charac- terize the norm so detection of the abnormal is possible well ahead of an actual threat. Once a threat is detected, the computer sys-tems must be autonomic and evolutionary in targeting the implicating behaviors and de- veloping monitoring capabilities to scruti- nize further actions in order to anticipate the threat's intent. c) Protection and Prevention Countering the insider threat will require a combination of current practices and new technologies with research aimed at more advanced protection and monitoring sys-tems. Security measures and enforcement limits, whether overt or covert, are inherent in protection and prevention. Protection against insider threats involves development of secondary and sometimes undisclosed measures to prevent inappropriate actions by trusted individuals or entities. Anyone can be presumed to be a candidate for insider threat. Strategies to address these threats include incremental access, progressive trust, estab lished duty integrity, and job-specific access control. Each strat-egy involves elements of sequestering, justi-fication, repetitive checking, and an under- standing of work scope. Research in all of these areas is lacking and a set of coordi-nated research and development tasks are required to build a comprehensive set of solutions for CI institutions. Goal-seeking, autonomous agent use for continuous auditing in all business and fi-nancial activities is a fundamental R&D need. 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 44 For example : In banking and finance sectors, real-time auditing is a challenge since most sys- tems are updated or restored at the end of the day or week, and it is diff icult to detect intra-day anomalies. Consequently, more advanced automated computer systems are needed to han- dle the task. Some of the more promising technologies include transaction profiling, contextual profiling, and mapping of periodic or spo- radic events. The high security of COP implementation does not preclude someone with access from becoming a threat. We must assume this is possible. The same anticipation of overt damaging action by a purposeful threat can be used to anticipate an unfortu-nate excursion in thought or action by a well-meaning actor. Part of these efforts are social and behavioral in how to interpret and respond, but the information about what is occurring and how things may be diverg-ing must come from advanced sensors and monitors and interpretive software systems within the COP. To meet the strategic goals of the COP, se- cure Internet, and resilient infrastructure, the insider threat research challenges for protection and prevention include develop-ing measures for assuring the integrity of the authorized scope of work. While wire- less, autonomic, evolutionary systems can prove extremely useful to the CIP strategic goals, research must be done to limit ex-treme autonomic activities, such as com-puter override of a human operator decision. Contextual profiling, transaction profiling and serial or sporadic event analyses need to be refined in order to effectively address insider threats. Theme 5 - Analysis and Decision Support Systems Analysis and decision support systems as they support the National Critical Infra-structure Protection Strategic Goals - Ex- amples: National Common Operating Picture for Critical Infrastructure: Providing tools to aid responders and leaders in handling a tragedy with full awareness of events Inherently Secure Next-Generation Comput- ing and Communications Network: Provid- ing automated and human assisted oversight and management of systems and networks with dynamic roles Resilient, Self-Diagnosing, Self-Healing Physical and Cyber Infrastructure Systems: Feed lessons learned from decision support monitoring into design of self-optimizing systems Critical infrastructure systems are complex, interconnected physical and cyber networks that include nodes and links with multiple components. Analysis and decision support methods help decision makers make in-formed choices involving these complex systems using structured, analytic ap-proaches that incorporate controlling factors and detailed knowledge re levant to the CI systems and their interconnectivity and reli- ance on one another. For CIP, decision and analysis R&D needs are to: Develop risk-informed prioritization and investment strategies to fund the most serious issues first, and to achieve the best return from the lim- ited funding resources available Develop precision vulnerability analysis tools to quantitatively pre-dict the performance of CI network elements if attacked, and advance these engineering tools to include new materials, innovative network design concepts, and emerging com-putational methods Develop high-fidelity modeling and simulation (M&S) capabilities to quantitatively represent the sectors, their interconnectivity, and deter- 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 45 mine realistic, science-based conse- quences if attacked Develop integrated, multi- infrastructure advanced action and response plans for a range of threat / hazard scenarios; and \"war-game\" these actions and plans to anticipate problems and prepare in advance the most effective combinations and se- quences of protection measures be- fore an event occurs. CIP requires a wide range of decision proc- esses, many of which involve value systems with input data in different units and ranges. As an example, a decision process regarding CI assets in a risk analysis may take cul- tural, historical, monetary value, economic losses, and political factors into account. The factors themselves may have different weights in the decision process. Other types of decision processes may involve some form of operations analysis employing engineering data such as queuing models used to model the flow of traffic in trans-portation networks, or deterioration and risk models to make investment trade-off deci- sions between maintaining or improving the security of existing systems versus replac-ing them with new, inherently more resilient systems. All of these systems and models involve uncertainties that also must be ad- dressed. The future R&D in analysis and decision support is critical due to: The increasing size and complexity of the models under examination; The vast size and complexity of the sectors being modeled; The requirement to tightly couple or integrate multiple models across dis-ciplines; The requirement to tightly couple or integrate multiple models across sec-tors; The absence of standardized analysis metrics and measures across sectors; and The need for more agile, robust and high confidence systems. Advances in the fundamentals of analysis and decision support approaches, combined with improvements in graphical and compu-tational capabilities and the ability to pro-vide actionable decision information with improved communication capability, will potentially transform how analysis is per-formed and decisions are made. The major focus areas for the Analysis and Decision Support Technologies Theme are: Risk Analysis for Prioritizing CIP Investments Threat Evaluation Vulnerability / Performance Evalua- tion and Design of Upgrades Forensic Analysis and Reconstruc- tion Consequence Analysis and Model- ing of Interconnected CI Sectors Integrated Systems Modeling Focus Areas for Analysis and Decision Support Systems a) Risk Analysis for Prioritizing CIP In- vestments The likelihood and consequences of threats to specific infrastructure vary widely. Damage to some elements of the infrastruc- ture would result in a large loss of life or cause major disruptions in the economy while damage to other elements would sim-ply be an inconvenience or perhaps a strike at our national pride - such as damage to a national monument without serious eco- nomic or public safety consequences. Some threats are much more likely to occur than 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 46 others, and impacts of attacks on one infra- structure could propagate to others because of infrastructure interdependencies or the proximity to the attacked asset. Under- standing the nature, magnitude, and rela-tionships of infrastructure systems and ap-plying prioritization methods to risk mitiga-tion strategies are essential for improved, economically sustainable protection of the Nation's CI. The risk assessment process, which results in a prioritization of alternative risk reduc-tion investments, serves as a systems inte-gration function. That is, risk assessment is where efforts in asset assessment, threat assessments, vulnerab ility assessments, in- cident response, consequence management, and consequence analysis are integrated into a coordinated framework for determining the likelihood and the expected conse- quences of a suite of events. This risk inte-gration provides a basis for prioritizing op-erational and investment decisions, and is a mechanism for filtering out less critical situations to concentrate efforts on the high- est priority actions. Research efforts are needed in this area to advance existing and develop new risk as-sessment and prioritization tools with inno-vative features such as collaborative leader- ship decision making that incorporate new insights and predictive models about human behavior, perspectives, and values, a topic discussed in Theme 7: New and Emerging Threats and Vulnerabilities and Theme 9: Human and Social Issues. These models are an integral part of developing a situa- tionally-aware national network of real-time decision models for risk assessment, mitiga-tion, and response, and are central to the strategic goal to create the COP. For a realistic, informed process for select- ing among mitigation alternatives, eco-nomic models are needed to realistically portray the full life-cycle costs of these al-ternatives so that cos t/benefit or return on investment evaluations include the full per- spective of initial costs, operation and main- tenance continuing costs, and disposal costs once new technology supercedes the exist- ing equipment or protective measure adopted. Advanced, effective risk analysis and priori- tization methods are fundamental to sup-porting the decisions of leaders during all phases of experiencing an emergency event or planning for an event, whether a natural disaster or an overt act. The balance of what to save, what to ignore, what to aban- don, and what to rescue as events unfold requires the COP as a presentation, simula-tion, and implementation platform where risk assessment is a continuous process. b) Threat Evaluation The evaluation of threats and their likeli- hoods is drawn from multiple sources of information and analysis of different types of threats and potential attackers. This in- volves a combination of information gather- ing, such as the data feeds into the COP, detailed analysis in or der to detect patterns and anomalies, unders tanding and modeling of human behavior, and translation of these sources into threat information relevant to CI systems. It also includes predictive modeling to anticipate potential next steps given past observations. The synthesis of all this information is then turned into ac-tionable intelligence. These processes and R&D requirements are part of separate Threat Evaluation and Intelligence R&D plans. CIP looks to these other efforts and R&D communities to pr ovide the advanced threat assessment and likelihood informa-tion essential to risk management and in- formed decision making. c) Vulnerability, Performance Evaluation and Design of Upgrades One of the key elements in risk analysis and prioritization is accurate performance pre- diction of critical infrastructure when sub- jected to the extreme loads from natural and man-made adverse events. This is quite different from traditional engineering de-sign analyses where loads on materials and components are well below failure levels. 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 47 Vulnerability analyses of CI subjected to extreme loads are based on design charac-teristics of the facility, behavior of the con- struction materials as they fail, mechanics of the structural system as it fails or redis-tributes loads to stronger remaining portions of the structure. Insights gained from these analyses are used to identify technologies that can be used to strengthen or \"harden\" the infrastructure. Improvements to building materials such as blast resistant exterior panels, window glaz-ing, improved structural frames, polymer wraps, energy absorbing and structurally resilient composite materials, and other ad- vances in materials science and engineering design play important roles in understand-ing and modeling the mechanics of per-formance of new designs - to and beyond failure states to be able to predict the resid- ual capacity of such designs even if severely damaged. Sophisticated mathematical models of these emerging materials must be developed and tailored to the physical properties and be- havior of new materials and designs. Im- proved analytical modeling capabilities for extreme loads such as blast and fire effects on structural systems are needed. Complex failure analysis models for entire structures based on integrated physics-based models and revolutionary new materials and de-signs are needed to effectively incorporate resilient-based design objectives, and to learn how to better protect essential loca-tions within facilities. R&D is needed to develop precision vulner- ability analysis tools to quantitatively pre-dict the performance of CI network ele-ments if attacked, and advance these engi-neering tools to include new materials, in- novative network design concepts, and emerging computational methods in order to achieve our strategic goal of resilient criti-cal infrastructure. These accurate engineer-ing models will provide the realistic basis for performance predictions, improved per- formance with structural upgrades, and quantified diminished service levels if dam- aged. Computer and network tools that monitor and simulate cyber environments are also critical to the development of new tech-nologies and applications. Each improve-ment in operating systems and network pro-tocols, in turn allow systems to perform more efficiently, better isolate vulnerabili- ties, and recover from abnormal situations. The COP and secure Internet both require the ability to not only operate in many situa-tions, but they must also have the ability to trigger analyses using the information they know to support management and decision- making even when the decision-maker does not know they need new knowledge. For example: The releas e of an airborne toxin from a chemical facility does not simply require a plume model. It may require that chemistry, mass spectroscopy, environmental models, weather synopsis and several more analyses be triggered and possibly feed results from one task to another in order to support decision-maker concerns about evacuation route, size and speed. This is a simple example of the complexity in both the physical and cyber areas that will be required and not all the analytical tools needed are in place, much less inte-grated in a manner to allow such fluid deci- sion support. d) Forensic Analysis and Reconstruction Forensic analysis and reconstruction are important elements to an effective response to an attack upon critical infrastructure, and they can contribute significantly to the de- velopment of retrofit/new designs and sys- tems with enhanced security. These ap-proaches are needed in validating the meth-ods by which vulnerabilities are assessed and protection is designed, and can be in- strumental in restoring the critical functions damaged in the attack. 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 48 Guidelines for the general practice of foren- sic engineering - \"What went wrong?\" - are reasonably well established. However, the usual practice can have direct implications to criminal investigations where a thorough and lengthy analysis is appropriate to estab-lish the cause based on the preponderance of evidence. In the case of a terrorist attack on critical infrastructure, human rescue and rapid re- covery of critical services have higher pri-orities that conflict with the methodical, time-consuming, evidence collecting and analysis stages of forensics. New practices must be developed that incorporate or help to de-conflict these multiple objectives. Research efforts in this area include devel- opment of expedient forensic analysis to accurately model system integrity and dam- age from extreme events including cyber attack, blast, fire, chemical and biological releases, and development of new guide-lines and technologies to leverage available resources and assist investigators in re-sponding to new and unfamiliar situations. Although technology for computer forensics has seen significant improvements over the past few years, the most advanced of these technologies are focused on \"data foren-sics,\" which is recovery and preservation of data from a variety of computer storage me- dia. In some cases, data are recovered from equipment used by criminals, while in other cases, evidence of criminal activity may be found in access log files on remote ma-chines. The use of computer forensics is an important part of creating an evidential case for law enforcement and criminal prosecu-tion of cyber crime. Thus, this will con-tinue to remain an important area of new technological development. There are, however, additional needs related to forensics, traceback, and attribution that are less mature from a technological stand-point. For example, the use of forensics approaches to identify and correlate distrib- uted network events is viewed as important not only from the law enforcement perspec-tive, but also for the ability to help recon- struct or understand the nature of distributed cyber attacks, including how they were exe- cuted and from where they originated. The forensic community will be able to col- lect detailed information through the sys-tems put in place to form the COP. The COP will not only support the issues identi-fied, but will also allow an environment of simulation that no simple exercise could achieve. The COP may help create new forms of forensics for CI assets to increase opportunities to learn how damages oc-curred and how to make infrastructure sys- tems more resilient in their future forms. e) Consequence Analysis and Modeling of Interconnected CI Sectors Consequence or impact analyses are needed to understand the severity of potential at- tacks, and how these consequences vary across all sectors for different threat scenar-ios. The challenge is to accurately model critical infrastructure processes and their interconnectivity and interdependencies with reasonable levels of accuracy to enable decision makers to understand the conse- quences of decisions they make and the trade-offs between different alternative ac-tions. There have been considerable efforts at modeling some infrastructure sectors. In the energy sector, for example, where very complicated models of the electric power grid and the natural gas pipeline system are quite mature. However, many of the mod-els of other infrastructures such as agricul- ture, food, banking and finance, government facilities, etc., are at an aggregated level, and therefore much less useful in a detailed analysis. Even in the more mature sectors, much of the modeling has been specific to one part or another of the sector, and not the entire sector. Most existing individual infrastructure models were designed for purposes internal to the originating organization, resulting in output modes and metrics that are usually 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 49 incompatible with those of other models. This presents challenges for integrated op-eration and analysis. This is particularly important because actions affecting one in- frastructure usually propagate across one or more other infrastructures - frequently re-sulting in unforeseen and unintended conse-quences. The only way to represent the complex, non-linear, interdependent nature of critical infrastructure is with advanced models and simulations. It is extremely important to have a simulation and assessment capability to allow decision-makers to understand, in depth, the critical infrastructure of the United States including its components, their coupling, and their vulnerabilities. This capability can be used in a crisis re-sponse mode, and in an analysis and as- sessment mode to provide decision-makers with a better basis to make prudent, strate-gic investments and policy resolutions to improve the security of infrastructures. There is a need for improved modeling and simulation methods that will make it easier to predict the behavior of generic networks in various scenarios, and to perform \"what if\" analyses that is equivalent to virtual ex-periments of network behavior under differ-ent conditions. Integration of such cyber network models into larger infrastructure models will contribute to the understanding that is gained from interdependency model-ing for the CI sectors. Understanding, modeling and operating through the many interdependencies, both static and dynamic, is an intrinsic compo- nent of the COP and secure Internet. f) Integrated Systems Modeling Integrated system analysis and modeling is the realization of a unified model that in- corporates disparate modeling and analysis components into a more realistic analysis and decision support method. Current mod-eling tools and capabilities are limited in their ability to integrate properties, results, and effects from other models and disci-plines. New physics-based modeling ap- proaches are needed that are interoperable, compatible, share common data, and pro- duce standardized results that can be easily combined and compared. Future models for protecting built infra- structure should include physical and cyber-security components, structural design and complex failure analysis, advanced chemi- cal property and material analysis, vulner- ability analysis and mitigation approaches, and system interdependencies. This in-cludes the complex integration of physical model dynamics with human behavior mod- els that may be necessary to better under- stand people movement issues related to egress. From a cyber systems perspective, inte- grated systems should have a ubiquitous security layer that seamlessly integrates dis- tributed sensor, control system, network, and server systems using interoperable and compatible hardware, software, and infor-mation-communication architectures. Research efforts in this area are needed to develop a full suite of critical infrastructure sector models with a ppropriate levels of resolution and accuracy needed to address CI operational processes and influences within and between infrastructures using interoperable model architectures. These models need to provide an executive level perspective of the types and severity of con-sequences realized in different threat sce-narios, and incorporate new types of deci-sion analysis tools to better understand the trade-offs between different actions and decisions. These tools need to incorporate economic and social science models to provide realis-tic loss/gain information and to introduce behavioral issues into the modeling and simulation (M&S) process. Real-time data feeds from pervasive distribution of smart sensor systems in the COP are needed for these analyses. 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 50 The COP is a knowledge assembly, aggre- gation, analysis, interpretation and imple-mentation platform for all forms of CI as- sets. It will require a level of integration unlike any system ever built. The advanced risk investment tools, precision performance analyses, and M&S consequence assess-ment capabilities, will enable the develop-ment of a more detailed map of future R&D investment steps to more effectively reduce risk and advance achievements toward the CIP strategic goals of resilience, secure Internet, and the COP. Theme 6 - Response, Recovery and Reconstitution Response, recovery, and reconstitution R&D as it supports the National Critical Infrastructure Protection Strategic Goals - Examples: National Common Operating Picture for Critical Infrastructure: The tools, methods and plans for those who must assess and respond to an event Inherently Secure Next-Generation Comput- ing and Communications Network: Mitiga- tion of attacks, reconstruction after damage, rebuilding and continuous strengthening Resilient, Self-Diagnosing, Self-Healing Physical and Cyber Infrastructure Systems: Incorporate new and emerging technologies in reconstitution construction to build inher- ently more resilient systems This theme covers a broad timeframe be- ginning with the period before an event oc-curs, through immediate response, to tem-porary recovery measures, all the way to complete and permanent restoration of the CI sectors and elements that have been im-pacted. The National Response Plan and supporting R&D from the Emergency Pre-paredness and Response community focus on saving lives and property, restoring order to the community, and meeting the specific needs of first responders. The CIP R&D efforts for this topic are more narrowly fo-cused on the critical infrastructure networks themselves, and getting these critical physi- cal and cyber services restored or replaced quickly and efficiently. The NCIP R&D Plan concentrates on technology in areas of response, recovery, and reconstitution par-ticularly for infrastructure operators and owners, and not on training and needs of more traditional groups of emergency re-sponders and civilians. Within this theme, the focus areas are: Response - Saving Lives, Property, and CI Capabilities Recovery - Temporary Restoration of Services Reconstitution - Permanent Restora- tion Techniques Focus Areas for Response, Recovery, and Reconstitution a) Response - Saving Lives, Property, and CI Capabilities Emergency Preparedness and Response R&D plans specifically address the needs of first responders to provide special protective clothing, advanced types of equipment to detect victims and assess safety hazards, and the need for high-fidelity modeling and simulation tools for response planning and training. The CIP aspects of response, re- covery and reconstitution emphasize the critical infrastructure itself, both physical and cyber, its operators and users, and re- sponse mechanisms that need to be inherent in the infrastructure to minimize the losses, delays, and downtimes for the intercon- nected CI sectors. Initial response to any terrorist, emergency or disaster event includes an accurate as-sessment of the situation and impacts of the event. Sensors distributed throughout the affected zones can provide information for this assessment. The structures themselves may be made of special materials with em-bedded sensors to detect the condition of the 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 51 structure, and have resilient properties that can be damaged but will not fail. Automated response features can be devel- oped and built into infrastructure to stop or reroute information in communication net-works to automatically contain fire and re-route heating, ventilation, and air condition-ing (HVAC) airflows for chemical or bio-logical attacks, or send out robots to recon- noiter and provide situational information, and even provide immediate medical assis-tance. The operators of CI will be the \"first re- sponders\" for the infrastructure system un- der attack, so they must have response plans and equipment, and be aware of the sensing and protection features embedded in their facilities to keep themselves safe and miti-gate the extent of damage. The better the assessment, the more completely the re- sponse can save lives, and mitigate property and cyber damage. As the magnitude of the disaster increases to catastrophic propor-tions, the assessment must become a coor-dinated process in order to cover the area impacted. With the advent of response to terrorist and Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD)-type events, initial assessments may need to be done remotely through sen-sors, or through unmanned sensor plat- forms. Within the cyber domain, similar principles of sensing and responding are already being applied to a broader spectrum of cyber secu-rity needs. With the physical infrastructure response examples cited above, sensing an attack and taking corrective action provides the ability to reduce the ef fects of an attack. Whereas detection of chemical or biological agents would typically occur after an attack has taken place, certain classes of attacks in cyberspace can be detected very quickly. In fact, in some cases it is even possible to de-tect indications of an attack prior to its ac-tual onset. For such attacks, taking the cor-rect action quickly enough makes it possible not only to reduce the effects of an attack, but to possibly avert it altogether. On in- creasingly shortening time scales, closely coupled automated sensing of, and response to, malicious activity is viewed not simply as a damage mitigation approach, but as a key protective strategy. Though technologies associated with the ability to detect attacks (sensing, informa-tion fusion, and event correlation) were pre-viously discussed in Theme 1: Detection and Sensor Systems, other important re- search areas in this context include analysis to automatically determine appropriate cor-rective actions, and effective coupling of both the analytical approaches and the tech-nological interfaces associated with detec- tion and response systems, which may be comprised of hardware, software, or both. Because some types of attacks (such as worms) are capable of propagating very quickly, the speed associated with detection, analysis, and response capability becomes critical. It is generally accepted that for some attacks, any response that requires human intervention, either to help identify an attack, to determine appropriate action, or to take corrective action, is doomed to failure because the attack would propagate too quickly and would effectively outrun the response. The implication here is that in addition to improving the capabilities of automated detection, analysis, and response approaches, technological advances are also needed along a different dimension to in-crease their speed. For those responding, having access to the COP and secure Internet will provide criti-cal access to \"experts at a distance\" as they are conduits for experts in science, engi- neering, technology, decision making, alter-native actions and much more from other responder communities. The COP will pro-vide awareness of other events that might affect their actions and use or availability of resources that may be critical if there is a coordinated multi-point attack or multiple impacts from a natural disaster. Unattended devices such as robotic platforms must be developed to provide the information essen- tial for effective decision support made available through the COP. 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 52 b) Recovery Site stabilization can range from access control to stabilization of a damaged struc- ture, temporary fixation of contaminants, and temporary bolstering or bracing. Con-tainment involves more than just maintain-ing a perimeter. It may include moving those involved to an area outside the initial event or it may be a requirement to keep them within a contaminated area even though it endangers them. Containment can take many forms, but the primary areas that need further work in-volve the containment of materials more than people. In public places, the contain- ment of dangerous substances requires spe-cial isolation, filtration, and deactivation technologies. Containment could involve a room, a building, an area or a region, but it could also involve containment within a controlled boundary around an individual. In dam, tunnel, and bridge CI, a re- examination by appropriate agencies, pro-fessional societies, and industries of design, construction, standards, materials and site selection is needed, including a look at the opportunities for stabilization and mitiga-tion. Temporary mitigation of contaminants is part of the stabilization process. The spread of chemical, biological or radioactive con- taminants by the movement of people and flow of air and contaminated particles im-mediately following or shortly after a chemical, biological or radiological/nuclear (CBRN) attack has the potential to put much greater portions of the population at risk. Gaseous, aerosol liquids, and particu-late solid contaminants traveling in a wind driven plume can potentially be counter-acted by spraying various solutions at the proper location and time. The CIP R&D plan looks to the CBRN R&D communities to provide effective decontamination meth-ods for critical infrastructure, and to the EP&R R&D communities to provide effec-tive gear and training for first responders and civilians caught in an emergency event. Temporary structures and services range from the temporary command center neces-sary for command and control of the disas- ter event, to rapidly deployed temporary bridges, hospitals, water and sewer systems, highways, dams, levees, electrical system towers, sub-stations, and distribution lines. Important temporary structures may address the need for housing thousands of victims evacuated from a city due to a major WMD event. Temporary services may include mass transit to transport victims and mass care to include food distribution and utility systems needed for such an effort. The advent of new materials, speedy as- sembly and/or construction, ease of assem-bly, and standardization will be important factors in this focus area. Cost will be an issue as will the ability to integrate the tem- porary construction into a final reconstitu- tion plan. In the case of temporary trans-portation restoration, there may not be an alternative route, so the temporary fix be-comes critically important. Since many of the critical components of the Nation's CI are now produced outside the country, there will often be long lead times for replace-ment. New and innovative ways to use ex-isting resources are needed to build tempo-rary repairs. In the cyber domain, sensors and automated responses improve the ability to recover from a recent cyber attack, or to mitigate the impact of an ongoing attack. On longer time scales the inherent architecture of the Internet, built on principles of redundancy decentralization, provides very robust re- routing around broken or damaged network nodes or routes. Additional research can result in technology that helps to accelerate this recovery, adding to the already high degree of resilience in the Internet. R&D tasks for CIP related to recovery in- clude development of new and innovative ways to use existing resources to perform temporary repairs to items that have long lead times. These innovations are steps to- wards more resilient CI systems. As recov- ery proceeds, the use of resources, the na- 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 53 ture of remaining threats or concerns, the characterization of the next steps, and the planning for staging and mobilization can benefit from a COP approach to gathering, presentation, and decision support. In addi-tion, the secure Internet is a critical resource to support the wide range of players and actions that need to convene in recovery efforts and reconstitution. c) Reconstitution - Permanent Restora- tion Techniques Permanent restoration involves examination of the temporary construction methods al-ready mentioned and attempt to integrate those with the long-term, permanent re- placement of the infrastructure. Recogniz-ing that most infrastructure is constructed after a long planning process, the mainte-nance of historical records documenting design and construction is important whether the infrastructure is replaced iden-tically or is modified to better suit a new set of design parameters in a changed environ-ment. Although the redundancy and high degree of interconnectedness give the Internet resil- ience, we cannot assume that these architec-tural principles will always be effective, and therefore should not rely solely on them. New technological concepts are needed to help networks and systems more consis- tently operate when da maged and/or recover from attacks. In particular, technology aimed at ensuring survivability of large-scale networks is needed to help increase robustness that would allow operation in the face of large-scale attacks. From a recovery and reconstitution point of view, the only approaches available at this time are redun-dant operational sites and data backups. Although restoration of lost or damaged data is a field that is becoming increasingly mature, network-based means of aiding rapid recovery and reconstitution are needed. Approaches that may be explored include modeling and analysis to determine optimal corrective actions, automated (or at the very least remote capability for) restruc-turing of networks in ways that rapidly change network routing and connections. Finally, we should investigate rapid recon- figuration of a variety of classes of tech- nologies ranging from individual hosts to networking technology to cyber security systems, all of which may include both hardware and software components. R&D tasks for CIP involve providing more resilient cyber and physical systems to move away from using legacy systems or components. These new replacement sys-tems and components can then have inher-ently secure or resilient aspects built into them. As part of providing information to the COP for monitoring and decision sup-port, CIP R&D needs to develop and inte-grate sensors that can monitor, analyze, and report the condition of the infrastructure. Theme 7 - New and Emerging Threats and Vulnerabilities Emerging threats and vulnerabilities R&D as it supports the National Critical Infra-structure Protection Strategic Goals - Ex-amples: National Common Operating Picture for Critical Infrastructure: Discover from the COP patterns, methods, tools, capabilities and devices we have not previously seen. Inherently Secure Next-Generation Comput- ing and Communications Network: Antici- pate new threats with solutions adversaries have not considered and negate legacy gaps Resilient, Self-Diagnosing, Self-Healing Physical and Cyber Infrastructure Systems: Incorporate sensing of possible new threats as intrinsic part of operations in CI assets. New and emerging threats can be techno- logical advances, combinations of existing technologies simply not yet anticipated, or advanced understanding by our enemies as to how to exploit aspects of our infrastruc- ture and use them against us. These threats lead to changes in vulnerabilities and possi- 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 54 ble consequences. Just a few of the emerg- ing technological threats would include: New explosives with almost no vola- tile release of trace chemicals Proliferation of emerging infections New toxins so unusual that there is no physical attribute or behavioral data available on them Bioengineered genomic and proteo- mic substances related to biological threats Electromagnetic, directed energy and pulse weapons which use no ammunition and are unrecognizable by most law enforcement personnel Nano-delivery methods of infini- tesimal but deadly materials New software virus architectures that arrive in pieces and self-assemble later New, more damaging network infes- tations which appear, perform, and self-destruct leaving no forensic trail Advances in technology are not the only threats. Advanced ingenuity and insight by adversaries about the American lifestyles and values can also be manifested as threats. For example, the September 11, 2001 attacks exemplified a high degree of sophistication and understanding of our weaknesses but used readily available commercial technology and training. In an era where international commercial interests are in the forefront of many tech-nological advancements and most critical infrastructure is privately owned, it is essen-tial that the protection strategy against new and emerging threats includes multi-faceted and layered solutions, both technical and non-technical. It must be assumed that all arenas of commercial and public endeavor may contain clues from which can be de-rived knowledge or envision target-rich vulnerabilities that should be addressed. The technology and methods to do this exist in some measure in the intelligence com- munity, but the scale of such efforts will require significant expansion to deliver what is required. This theme asks the critical question, \"How well can we anticipate the next generation of threats or identify the next emerging or previously undetected vulnerability of our CI?\" The purpose of this theme is to pro- pose research directions that will institute CIP-focused detection, analysis, and inter- pretation processes and capabilities to en- able the country to have actionable intelli-gence for serious threats to complex inter-connected CI sectors and: to anticipate and discover the formu- lation of threats that exploit existing technologies in innovative ways; and to anticipate and discover the formu- lation of threats that exploit new technologies while they are in the making or at least before they ma-ture to a state where they can be re-liably delivered by our enemies. These advances will come primarily from the intelligence R&D community as many involve tools and methods the intelligence community is already addressing in the face of new and sophisticated adversaries. CIP relies on the intelligence community to pro- vide information about threats and their likelihood for risk-based decision support analyses. This intelligence is critical to en-act appropriate countermeasures, set in- vestment priorities, and maximize the pro- tection that can be achieved within limited budgets. CIP R&D must work cooperatively with the intelligence community to communicate CIP vulnerabilities, consequences, and op- erational characteristics to assist the intelli- gence community as they seek and analyze indicators from massive amounts of data. Conversely, as new forms of infrastructure 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 55 are being planned (e.g., nanotech manufac- turing or biotech fabrication facilities), look at what they do, what they use or produce as materials, what they can accomplish, and dependency on their results and potential sources of new threats and vulnerabilities will be required . Focus Areas for New and Emerg- ing Threats and Vulnerabilities a) Detect and Prevent Innovative Uses of Existing Technologies The efforts necessary to reliably discover and characterize oncoming threats are ex-tremely difficult even when the telltale data are right in front of us. Significant progress is needed to yield powerful additions to the existing intelligence arsenal and improve cognitive and interpretative capabilities. It is necessary to learn to recognize threats in new and different ways where all possible knowledge addition pathways and vehicles can be leveraged while protecting sources appropriately. This calls for much more distributed forms of information gathering and interpretation to achieve security and enable flexibility. For cyber infrastructure, there is a need to anticipate potential innovative uses and ma-nipulation of available technology that can be turned on the Nation's assets to confuse, disrupt or destroy. A key concern is the growing use of \"intelligent\" Internet proto-col (IP) addressable devices. This broad use of IP from mainframe computers to per-sonal computers (PC), to servers, to overall infrastructure, to individual components has immense implications for new forms of ef- ficiency, new kinds of commerce, new lev-els of extraction of value, and new dangers that have not been properly researched or communicated. Though these capabilities will add greatly to what can be done as a Nation, they also come with opportunities to deliver new and more far reaching threat levels than ever before. An aggressive effort is essential to effectively and fully envision these commu-nication advances and devise scenarios and techniques to detect, deny, and defeat at-tempts at disruptions. Another critical cyber area involves new forms of detection that must be used in next generation systems where autonomous goal-seeking software agents interact freely and alter their behaviors and strategies dynami-cally. Detection and monitoring of such agents doing their assigned work is chal- lenging; detecting agents that have gone rogue or that are attempting things they should not be doing will require much more advanced techniques than are available to- day. In both Theme 1: Detection and Sen- sor Systems and Theme 2: Protection and Prevention, the detection of and protection from existing forms of agents is discussed, but there are much more sophisticated vari- ants likely in the future, and R&D for their use should have a parallel track to examine countermeasures and monitoring tech-niques. The most sophisticated of these are coming out of the advanced gaming indus-try. In all these areas, the fundamental concern of this plan is not to direct or change the methods and plans of the intelligence com-munity. Rather, it is to examine the struc-ture, components, interfaces, communica- tions, standards, and integration of the ele- ments of critical infrastructure and incorpo-rate methods, processes and technology that will enable the intelligence community to gather information accurately, interpret this in an informed manner, and test hypotheses of new and emerging threats with an estab- lished family of subject matter experts in each sector. One facet of this theme involves the need for a new form of Red Teaming . Red Teaming is most often done in defense work where examination of adversaries, their tac-tics, their weapons, etc. are juxtaposed with considerations of what they might develop next. In some cases, science and technol-ogy experts may be involved. However, the need exists now to develop new forums in which science, technology, law enforce- 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 56 ment, terrorist experts and infrastructure operators are brought together to consider the next generation of weapons and threats that are at the edge of current possibilities and beyond. Primary strategic goals of the COP and se- cure Internet become the vehicle through which the world can be sensed, and learned, in a digital sense. A powerful use for the COP and supporting secure Internet is to allow the assemblage of complex images of how the world works in many different situations in order to more easily decipher when an activity or circumstance takes a path we have not previously recognized. This is scene change detection where the scene is the Nation or a subset of it. The COP and secure Internet are the school where the ability to learn exists enough to better detect anomalies or changes in behav- ior, and learn about things that may need to be observed more closely. b) Detect and Defeat the Use of New Technologies The second form of emerging threats to de- tect, recognize, and defeat are those pre- sumed are not yet possible or at least be-yond the means of most adversaries. In the past, the intelligence community learned about the many new advances that might enable new threats through the same infor- mation channels as adversaries. In this new era, it is necessary to consider how to moni-tor new and emerging science and technol-ogy advances and discern whether they have the potential to also become new physical or cyber threat contributors. It can be difficult for any one group of spe- cialty- or discipline-focused researchers to consider how their technologies might be combined with other efforts to create more lethal or disruptive forces than any one of the ingredients alone. A unique and indis-pensable form of research that this plan must consider is the discovery and analysis of complex integrated threat combinations unique to CI. It is necessary to assemble the people, the tools, and new process mod-els to address this extremely challenging task. In the cyber area, this theme must address the threats created by encryption and encap- sulation technologies that hide other threats. The techniques used to develop encryption are also available to the opposition. For protection of critical infrastructure, both cyber infrastructure and physical infrastruc- ture that is controlled by cyber methods, should be engaged in proactive countermea-sures R&D to prevent encryption \"bombs\" from entering cyber space, develop defeat mechanisms so that they cannot be trig- gered, and develop rapid rerouting or recov- ery measures to render them insignificant. The strategic goals of COP and the secure Internet provide a modeling and simulation platform on which to postulate new threats, test to see how significant their impacts might be, and test their ability to penetrate protective measures and disrupt critical ser-vices. Every possible candidate threat envi-sioned cannot be chased, but those that ap-pear to be most serious can be tested in a comprehensive manner to discern whether they require further investigation. The tools to allow interpretation of what the COP in-dicates are this focus area's main deliver-able. c) CIP Support for Intelligence Gather- ing To reach this plan's three strategic goals, the R&D provides essential tools for the intelligence community to use and adapt to better detect, interpret, and quantify threats against the critical infrastructure. Close cooperation and exchange is needed be-tween CIP and intelligence communities. Nuances necessary for interpretation may be missed by a lack of understanding of the components, operational characteristics, and \"choke\" points that surface due to the inter-connectivity and interrelationships between the sectors. Focused intelligence teams with diverse experience and subject matter expertise 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 57 provide an extended range of human cogni- tion and insight, and are crucial to the suc-cess of the COP. Such teams can draw on both pre-engineered sets of data from the detection and sensing stream and other sources to analyze the data with digital tools and human skills, engage in further rounds of data collection, redeploy sensors, ana-lyze, and visualize these results to deter- mine what adversaries are doing and then provide actionable intelligence to CIP deci-sion makers. The decision support systems and modeling and simulation tools, dis-cussed in Theme 5: Analysis and Decision Support Techniques, are key to developing well-engineered data collection strategies for the multiple types of sensors and data sources available to the intelligence com-munity to assess threats to CI, and to assist decision makers in real time during an emergency. The primary goals of a COP and secure Internet of this plan form a powerful learn-ing and testing environment within which, considering not only new threats envi- sioned, but also scenarios which when played out may point to methods that would not have otherwise been considered. The COP is the only arena that will be able to examine and consider complex interde- pendent vulnerabilities across sectors and organizations that have never been modeled collectively. Theme 8 - Advanced Infrastruc- ture Architectures and Systems Design Advanced Infrastructure Architectures and Systems Design as they support the Na- tional Critical Infrastructure Protection Stra- tegic Goals - Examples: National Common Operating Picture for Critical Infrastructure: Advance Common Operating Picture systems to include dy-namic situational awareness and interpreta- tion. The results will provide integration of sensing systems with automated responses for infrastructure protection, and communi-cation of conditions and actions to the infra- structure attribute knowledge base. Inherently Secure Next -Generation Com- puting and Communications Network: Guide development of next-generation se- curity for Internet protocol-based process control systems and services so that they are fundamentally more secure in their design and evolution. Resilient, Self-Diagnosing, Self-Healing Physical and Cyber Infrastructure Systems: Incorporate smart materials, embedded sen- sors, and monitoring systems integrated into new, inherently secure physical and cyber networks. Build systems that are capable of designing their own improved replacement. All three strategic goals of this plan require new computing architectures from the most fundamental level of the core of an operat- ing system, to the definition of an interface, to new secure protocols far more advanced in security, processing speed, and efficiency than anything available today. It is not solely for these goals that the need exists to seek such advances as many were already being planned to support areas like next generation cyber security and new protec-tive materials for buildings. This theme discusses how far beyond simple product and system evolution is required to achieve security beyond current limits. This theme area addresses the framework to develop next-generation infrastructural con-cepts, architectures and systems, both physical and cyber and includes built-in security and better operation. Fundamental science and engineering advances are needed to create the tools and methodolo-gies to enable CI facilities, delivery sys-tems, sensors and detectors, information systems, and SCADA systems of the future to have robust, new designs. These designs must be able to withstand, and automati-cally adjust to, events such as terrorist at- tacks and natural disasters and they must continue to perform reliably and safely, even if at somewhat diminished capacity during a short period of recovery. 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 58 As part of this theme, the following focus areas are addressed: Re-examination of Fundamental Theory behind Systems Legacy Systems Design and Architecture System Design Concepts for Next- Generation Critical Infrastructure Auto-Responsive and Self-Healing Systems Flexible, Robust, and High- Confidence Critical Infrastructure Platforms, Standards and Technol- ogy Layers From the context of current capabilities - and those to be produced by this R&D - many opportunities exist for greater distrib-uted interconnection and networked coop-erative operation among devices and sys- tems to dramatically raise the level of secu- rity, operational reliab ility, and support bet- ter decision-making. A key challenge is the integration and inter- operation of complex, networked systems. Ad hoc, patchwork attempts cannot achieve the same value as true integration, which incorporates design methods and enhance-ments produced by a full reexamination and reconstruction of the underlying technolo-gies. Focus Areas for Advanced Infra- structure Architectures and Sys- tems Design a) Re-examination of Fundamental The- ory behind Systems System complexities and interconnectivity are often cited as the least-understood, high-consequence source of vulnerability in in- frastructure systems. Complexity in infra- structures systems is introduced at varying scales through the hierarchy of subsystems comprising physical and cyber components, linkage of these components within and across infrastructures, and human and eco- nomic interfaces. Driven by increased eco- nomic efficiencies, infrastructure compo-nents and systems have become increas-ingly more coupled and controlled through a cyber infrastructure layer often imple-mented on the relatively insecure Internet. Compounding these issues, infrastructures are typically composed of a hybrid mix of old and new subsystems, which have inde-pendently evolved with usually only local operational concern for security and reli- ability. As a result, infrastructures possess latent failure modes, which can have unan-ticipated and widespread consequences. The development of robust and cost- effective principles for the architecture of systems must be preceded by an improved systems-level understanding of infrastruc-ture structure, function, and dynamics. This focus area calls for the application and ex-tension of complex systems theory to infra-structures for the purpose of developing new and fundamental engineering method- ologies to improve design and operation of infrastructures. As the CIP Plan evolves in future years and the pace of technology continues to ad- vance, this focus area will be a continuous process wherein assumptions are examined and basic methods are tested to ensure that a new legacy of static methods which adver-saries can easily learn and overcome is not being created. All three strategic goals will be supported by this process. b) Legacy Systems Design and Architec- ture The CI sectors are currently composed of and controlled by \"legacy\" cyber and physi- cal systems and networks of systems, i.e., systems that were put in initially and added on to over the years and decades. SCADA and distributed or digital control systems (DCS) that control current physical distribu-tion and operation of systems may be dec- ades old and consist, in part, of decades old 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 59 operating systems. It is neither economi- cally nor technically feasible to consider widespread replacement of this critical in- frastructure with new generation, state-of- the-art systems in a short time frame. The capital investment associated with replace-ment of major systems may be prohibitive until costs of the new technology can be reduced and the benefits over the legacy systems are clearly understood. Regarding technical feasibility, state-of-the- art systems, component designs, and ad-vances in materials science may not yet be ready or appropriate for full implementation or may be incompatible with existing equipment. Significant effort must be ex-pended to address improvements for these legacy issues, as they will remain functional for many years to come. R&D efforts here involve the novel and se- lective use of advanced software and intel-ligent devices that act as guides, guards, envelopes or overseers of existing systems and components which are tied via a secure communication network and have authority to participate in system actions. Such com- panion systems will allow economically viable evolution from current to future technology at a rate the CI can absorb. The COP strategic goal, the ability to allow older systems to connect and benefit from the new secure Internet, and developing the inherent resilience of CI systems cannot be achieved without addressing the dominance of legacy elements in the infrastructure. c) System Design Concepts for Next- Generation Critical Infrastructure Networking and systems research that pro- duced the Internet have yielded radical change and a society globally focused on information. In addition to rapid communi- cation, the Internet provides a cyber compu- tational grid by enabling high-performance and clustered, smaller computers, and mas-sive data centers that are connected and shared. Internet-based sharing of computa-tional facilities and data resources has cre- ated opportunities for collaborative virtual working environments, and virtual control of sensing and control systems for monitor-ing, operation, prediction, and control within the country's CI sector networks. However, current architecture of the Inter-net and the tools within it are largely inse-cure. Protecting these systems against a knowledgeable community of adversaries and will require massive overhaul to make them fully secure. To develop the next generation cyber infra- structure, research needs must address its architecture and design, by building the fundamental basis on new concepts for ro- bust and secure networking, systems soft- ware for real-time sensing and control, and integrated data acquisition, information management, and simulation technology. The Internet of the future must be designed with its incorporation in the Nation's criti- cal infrastructure sectors in mind. Cyber-systems must be capable of detecting and responding to a large number of threats that change frequently over the course of even a few hours or days. Next generation cyber systems and control systems will be designed in the early planning stages to in-corporate security-related standards, secure hardware designs, common secure commu-nication protocols, and other requirements and guidelines. New cyber platforms need to leverage advances in grid-based comput-ing concepts, increasingly powerful com-puter systems on-a-chip, and wireless com-munications technology. Advanced systems will include self-organizing networks that can spontaneously communicate and col- laborate with other networks in a larger sys-tem. These \"smart\" networks can adjust their roles and deliver new levels of com-munication and computing capacity. Co-design of physical and information sys- tems needs improvement. Design and sys-tems infrastructure approaches are needed that enable safe, reliable, automatic transi-tion from failure to recovery modes. Cur-rent systems are generally static in their de- signs; new research is needed to enable safe dynamic composition and specialization of 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 60 open, cooperating systems as they are de- ployed. Design capability is particularly lacking for reactive, reconfigurable, high- confidence systems. New opportunities also exist for break- throughs in physical infrastructure, ranging from cyber hardware to the basic concepts of the physical infrastructure itself. Major advances in understanding the physics un- derlying critical infrastructure systems and emerging materials will generate new types of infrastructure and new vulnerabilities which must be understood and contained before they are implemented. For example: There are extensive advances coming in the use of solar power in mobile plat- forms that could assist mu ch faster recovery and support of a critical asset after an attack, but these solar powered platforms will require new forms of protection. In their current form they are extremely fragile and vulnerable to radio frequency disruption unlike conventional collec- tors for solar power. To achieve a well-integrated system re- quires a holistic or system-level perspective throughout the design process, i.e. looking at the whole system rather than concentrat-ing on individual components. It requires a complete understanding of the whole sys- tem, the materials and constituent subsys- tems, the interconnectivity and interrela-tionships between the elements in the sys-tem (people, physical, and cyber infrastruc-ture elements), and the other systems the next generation architectures will intercon- nect with. Integration includes more than the simple connection or combination of the parts. Integrated systems require new ap-proaches to yield an enterprise system with internal processes holistically designed to provide optimum performance and robust- ness of the system. To stand up the COP and secure Internet and make resilient infrastructure the norm is a true test of the ability to develop a much broader version of system design and inte- grated thinking. d) Auto-Responsive and Self-Healing Systems System resilience is a crucial goal for CIP. R&D is needed to develop self-healing sys- tems that can automatically and reliably respond to adverse events, even before hu-man involvement is needed, to stabilize the situation, maintain and optimize remaining system capability even though performance may be diminished, depending on the nature and severity of the event. For example: A collection of processors, wire- lessly connected and aware of their differing responsibilities and information access paths would be able to re-task and reallocate their col- lective resources by rear rangement of duties and connectivities when some are destroyed or dis- rupted. For cyber CI, capabilities are needed for systematic, semi-autonomous restoration of an entire network back to normal, in a time period short enough to eliminate significant service disruption and prevent cascading failures. Key to such resilience is not that each component and element is able to re-cover itself, but rather that the system is capable of understanding its goals and available resources, and of modifying the roles and duties of all available resources to fit the needs at hand and maintain the per-formance metrics required. It is one thing to recover basic function at a reduced ca- pacity; it is much different to restore the bulk of the system strength and service by clever restoration using new techniques. For physical infrastruct ure the corollary is resilient, self-healing, self-calibrating physical systems and components that may even have self-sustaining features (such as independent power supplies), and can adapt to changing environm ental conditions (such as intruder sensors that modify themselves to the time of day and weather conditions, or structural sensors that change level of focused reporting to damaged locations.) Some components of critical infrastructure have already been designed to have special 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 61 features to protect them against natural haz- ards. Embankment dams that have self-healing and sacrificial features to prevent catastro- phic failures if subjected to severe earth-quakes are a good example, as are water supply pipelines that cross earthquake faults that have pre-positioned repair supplies to rapidly restore services to large urban communities. Emerging new materials that provide blast protection by deforming to absorb blast energy and yet return to origi-nal form to provide continued service are another good example. R&D is needed to provide cost-effective alternatives, new methods of construction, innovative de-signs, and innovative materials to develop self-reporting, self-healing, and self-responding new architectures for critical physical infrastructure. A key challenge is to build and support the new cross-disciplinary partnerships needed to scale up and apply these new technolo-gies. These groups must build on existing and emerging mathematical and physical foundations, and must cope with the chal- lenges of real world, large-scale integration of control and design. The criticality of this focus area is so strong to the future of CIP that it was made an overarching strategic goal for the plan. Part of this is its broad participation in so many of the needed solutions, but also because it is a very demanding focus that involves many disciplines and coordinated advances. e) Flexible, Robust, and High- Confidence Critical Infrastructure De- signs Although the goal is holistic, system-level design and construction of advanced infra-structure systems, advanced systems may still be assembled from software and hard- ware components manufactured anywhere in the world. The pr ocesses used to produce these components may not conform to stan-dardized architectures or performance re-quirements. Consequently, it will become increasingly more important that these components respond properly, even if sub-ject to abuse or attack, and that confidence in them is based on rigorous design criteria, significant testing, and examination of the component itself. Although rudimentary tools currently exist for testing software for vulnerabilities, there are significant needs for advances in this area. Methods are needed for determining the behavior of a software program and for building techniques that produce evidence that programs and components will behave as intended and do not incorporate functions that may allow unauthorized access or op- erations. Alternatively, rigorous design re-quirements aided by logic checking soft-ware development tools can significantly increase software predictability and reliabil- ity. Innovative design and use of new materials and designs will require performance testing for critical physical infrastructure systems and components, since accepted design technology for critical systems is built on experience or evidence of successful per- formance even under severe conditions. Entirely new types of testing technologies may be needed as the underlying ap-proaches to providing CI services change with advances in science and engineering. In order to achieve success in all three of this plan's strategic goals, abilities to as-semble, test, and validate both the initial and long-term strength and stability of CI support systems must be advanced beyond current tools and practices. f) Platforms, Standards and Technology Layers The process of developing new architecture and system designs involves a continuous cycle of innovation, testing, and evaluation, standardization, and implementation. The innovation phase of the development cycle contains a wide range of possible inputs. New types of cyber platforms most fre-quently evolve from existing platforms al- 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 62 ready in use, but the next generation of plat- forms and standards must go beyond evolu-tion. New platforms must view physical and cyber as co-dependent elements. Standards and guidelines form the founda- tion of new advanced architectures and sys-tems. The standards community under-stands this key role and is developing an R&D plan to address these issues. How- ever, the urgency of CIP suggests learning from other industries whose business mod-els have forced them to move away from the current time-consuming, consensus-based standards process toward a rapid model such as used in the communications and computer industry. Here, standards are developed in months rather than years with full realization that there may be adjust-ments, improvements, and upgrades to the solution, and that the perfect solution may not be possible the very first time. The continuing need to integrate new tech- nologies into existing systems depends on the effective use of standards and test and evaluation approaches. Standards, test and evaluation methods, measurement methods, codes, requirements, and guidelines are ex-amples of important elements to new archi-tectures and systems that empower and di-rect a broad range of technology infrastruc- tures. An important component to the develop- ment of new intelligent architectures and systems will be the effective extension of the \"technology layers.\" Intelligent systems requiring fast and effective integration in- clude multiple technology layers that range from hardware control through communica-tion protocols, operating and networking systems, and applications. Each layer must provide flexibility to respond and adapt to changing requirements to the larger system. New systems must also begin to incorporate effective layer integration with their human operators. Human and computer interfaces must continue to advance to through devel-opment of improved devices and ap- proaches to communication. The strategic goals of the CIP R&D plan would be almost unachievable in the long-term without full and complete addressing of the issues tendered in this theme. If we built the most powerful and complete meth-ods of sensing, detecting, protecting, etc. possible for all the different CI we have and put them in place without planning for the advances in technology, we would be build- ing a new legacy that would be as big an impediment to sustaining and enhancing our critical infrastructure protection as the cur-rent systems are. Addressing the issues within this theme are not an afterthought or last step before using a technology, but rather an intrinsic thought process that must be addressed continuously. Theme 9 - Human and Social Issues This theme addresses human and social is- sues as they support the National Critical Infrastructure Protection Strategic Goals. Examples include: National Common Operating Picture for Critical Infrastructure : Anticipate reactions and actions of those involved in an event before, during, and after it occurs, and pro-vide an integrated view of the risks to soci-ety from terrorist events, natural disasters, and other emergencies. Inherently Secure Next-Generation Comput- ing and Communications Network : De- velop improved systems that better address computer - human interactions. Resilient, Self-Diagnosing, Self-Healing Physical and Cyber Infrastructure Systems : Use software processes that have learning capabilities modeled after human learning processes, and incorporate these software processes into infrastructure systems to has-ten and guide self-improve ment and repair. This theme addresses the need for research and development in distinct areas of the human and social sciences. Critical infra-structure protection is concerned with the infrastructure operators, owners, the societal 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 63 effects on the economy and market forces, effects on societal openness of security, and the communication between the government and private infrastructure sectors. Other research and development groups, such as the social, economic, and behavioral R&D communities are interested in the processes of the human mind and the human motiva-tions of terrorists. The country's critical infrastructure (CI) is composed of various human, cyber, and physical components that must work effec-tively together to sustain the reliable flow of goods, people, and information vital to quality of life. The relationship between people and their physical and cyber infra-structure is intimate and complex. People, as individuals and groups, invent, build, operate and work within this environment. The environment, like the people, is con- tinually changing, in part as a result of the interaction of infrastructure with people and in part as a simple function of the passage of time. Men and women of varying ages, experi- ence and expertise, coming from long- established American communities includ-ing immigrant and migrant communities, are the ones who build where we live, de-termine how we travel, and put in place the lines that bring water and power to our homes, among many other things and ser-vices. These workers - and their families - also are the customers and users of the ser-vices delivered via critical infrastructure. Policy and decision-makers, both public and private, operate within domains shaped by their knowledge, experience, and connec-tions to occupationa l and personal human and social networks. All of these shape and constrain how well infrastructure serves the public need. Four categories of issues identify the Criti- cal Infrastructure Protection (CIP) focus for this theme. These relate to both physical and cyber insults against critical infrastruc-ture sectors and cut across the previous 8 themes in this plan: Communication and Cooperation among Government and Private Sec-tors User-Centered Designs Resiliency of Commercial Enter- prises and the Economy Related to Infrastructure Risk Communication and Manage- ment Part of the challenge of infrastructure pro- tection is how to take full advantage of hu-man capabilities. The Social, Behavioral and Economic (SBE) Working Group in the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) is focused on scientific research in the areas of sensory, motor, cognitive, and adaptive capability of the human. Cur- rently, the brain is unmatched by any tech- nological system. The human brain is a semi-quantitative supercomputer that is programmable and reprogrammable by ex-plicit training, previous experience, and on-going observations on a real-time, virtually instantaneous basis. Human eyes are capable of high-resolution, stereo-optical vision with immense range, and, integrated with a highly plastic brain, make humans uniquely capable of discov- ery, integration, and complex pattern recog- nition. Human hands constitute a dexter-ous, sensitive biomechanical system that, integrated with the brain and eyes, are un-matched by current a nd near-future robotic technologies. Humans operate in groups synergistically and dynamically, adjusting perceptions, relationshi ps and connections as needed on a real-time and virtually in-stantaneous basis. Human language capa-bilities exist and operate within a dimen- sional space that is far more complex and fluid than any known artificial architectures. 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 64 Focus Areas for Human and So- cial Issues a) Communication and Cooperation among Government and Private Sectors Four key areas of the national infrastructure system are internal government systems, internal private sector systems, government-private sector systems, and industry-to-industry interfaces. Approximately 85% of our Nation's critical infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector. Many parts of that private sector are multinational and operate on a global scale, both to supply materials necessary to function and to find workers. Industry, unlike government, must operate in a for-profit mode, or it does not survive. The defense of the Nation is, how-ever, a government responsibility. Our de-fense infrastructure systems are mainly owned and operated by the government sec- tor. In the September 11, 2001 attacks on the Pentagon, the government was responsible for initiating, monitoring, and completing the rescue of persons in the building, recon- structing the damaged area to the building, and returning workers to their workplace. Hospitals had to communicate and cooper-ate with the federal, state, and local officials to be as prepared as possible to receive vic- tims of the attack by knowing possible status and numbers of the incoming victims. Within the government, decisions had to be made and priorities had to be triaged in the best way to employ personnel to address the crisis. The hospitals also have their own internal triage system as to how they select patients who do and do not require urgent care. On September 11, 2001 in Washington, DC, all government workers were released at the same time, and as a result the highways and metro system were overwhelmed. Not long after, the metro system closed, emptying thousands of people back on the streets. Taking this example, metro workers (opera-tors) were flooded with passengers (users) boarding and then unloading. On the streets, police were responding to the attack on the Pentagon while also trying to direct traffic. An added level of coordination was required once metro unloaded all its riders. This is just an example of how sectors need to communicate quickly regarding changing situations. More research needs to be done to characterize the impacts users and opera-tors have on the environment during a cri- sis. Another area to be addressed is collabora- tive leadership. In a crisis, leaders from many sectors must come together to make collaborative decisions on difficult issues. These decisions may even involve sacrific- ing lives so that others can be saved. In crises, leaders will often have to make diffi-cult decisions quickly that will have an im-pact on a large group of people. Research needs to be done to illuminate dynamics in collaborative leadership during crises. b) User-Centered Designs The multiple technological systems de- scribed in the other sections of this docu-ment all interface with humans at some point. The increasing dependence on re- mote sensing and robotic intervention sys-tems, rather than simply replacing or re-moving the human element have become part of the new workplace for those who work within, and protect, the Nation's criti- cal infrastructure. When a surveillance sys-tem detects a potential threat, it is often a human operator who is responsible for de-termining what actions to take. The field referred to as \"human factors en- gineering\" (HF/E) incorporates the study of humans and their interaction with systems, products, and the built environment. HF/E is both a science of human performance and an engineering discipline, concerned with the design of systems for both efficiency and safety. Since before World War II, human factors scientists have been match-ing systems, jobs, products, and environ-ments to the physical and cognitive capa-bilities and limitations of people. 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 65 The user-centered design approach to the \"weak link\" (people) in an otherwise secure cyber system is to recognize the cognitive, emotional and social capabilities of the hu- man and design security passwords and identification systems around the user. The HF/E undoubtedly affects decisions in times of crisis, as often several persons from vari-ous organizations have to come together to find a solution. These social behaviors will inform how the COP is established in addi-tion to the data inputs (such as number of ambulances activated, number of fire per-sonnel on the scene, etc). A secure Internet architecture is critical dur- ing a crisis, and research needs to be done that takes into account the often panicked and highly stressful state a crisis can cause for operators and users. The Internet sys- tems need to be secure while at the same time perform quickly and be easily under-stood by all users, often across several sec-tors. Cyber security technology should be informed by social and behavioral scientific analysis of deceptive behaviors, cognitive capabilities, and the use of everyday heuris- tics; it must be informed by the systematic analysis of what people do and where lapses do - and do not - occur. c) Resiliency of Commercial Enterprises and the Economy Related to Infrastruc- ture For CIP, human aspects of resiliency focus on the operators and owners of the infra-structures affected by an event, in addition to the general public, and also focus on en- suing economic effects manifested by peo- ple changing their purchasing decisions and lifestyles in response to an attack. An analysis of historical failures of complex systems, such as Three Mile Island and the August 2003 Northeast blackout, suggests that there are unrealized opportunities for improved decision-making and long-term management of these resources that could significantly enhance their secure and reli-able operation. Robust control is hampered by the limited understanding of the dynam-ics of these systems and the cognitive limits of human operators, whose performance is constrained by incomplete or inaccurate system state data and operational guide- lines. Furthermore, agile organizational response is often lacking during times of crisis accompanying large-scale infrastruc-ture failure. Improved human interfaces are necessary that acknowledge human cogni- tive abilities and limits and are consistent with the training/education levels of CI op-erators. Finally, the public's response dur-ing and following an infrastructure failure can be a dominant contributor to the aggre- gate impact from an event, particularly in the case of terrorist attacks, made evident by the economic downturn following Sep-tember 11, 2001. As the country strives for a more integrated set of systems that encompass the physical and the cyber, and the interconnections and dependencies between them, those trying to operate or control that environment can eas-ily be overwhelmed. Often much time and effort is spent on automating such systems and making them act as perfectly as possi- ble in all normal operating modes. We un-derestimate the confusions we create when an operator is faced with an upset or fail condition or collection of conditions that was not part of the training. A terrorist can understand the many modes of operation and may be experienced in a targeted facil-ity and will therefore seek those conditions that fall outside the normal or anticipated modes. The same is true of natural events and accidents in some cases. As a result, we must strive to provide CI with human interfaces that begin with the principles learned from Three Mile Island, nuclear submarine disasters, and other examples. Intrinsic with this concern is the fact that the next generation of control systems will have intelligent physical devices, subsystem self-optimization, component role-shifting, autonomous goal-seeking software agents, and much more. All of these will require a completely different way to view the state of a system, current conditions, anticipated conditions, proposed courses of action, etc. 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 66 The critical infrastructure cyber communi- ties can draw on the years of work already spent addressing these issues by DoD. Although considerable research has exam- ined components of the public health and healthcare sector and the vulnerability of infrastructure, less is known about the social and economic aspects of vulnerability. So-cial vulnerabilities, like loss of community, and the social mediation of vulnerability often are overlooked in after-disaster cost/loss estimation reports. To date, there has been little research effort focused on identifying socially constructed vulnerabili- ties or on comparing the social vulnerability of one place to another. Models of various threats need to be evalu- ated against empirical data that includes human individual and group behaviors. For example, in a toxic gas release scenario, understanding and integration requires: Expert analysis regarding the most effective behavior for people within the immediate or longer-term range of the gaseous plume, and whether people should stay in their buildings, which are likely to have ventilation systems open to the outside, or whether they should seek other shel-ter. An understanding of what the local public knows and believes. How willing are people to engage in a particular advised behavior? Research that would include exami- nation and measurement of beliefs of officials towards the public. How well-informed are the emergency re- sponders and others who will inter- act with the public, such as members of the media - what are the expecta-tions of public health and emergency officials, law enforcement, and jour-nalists and TV hosts about potential harm, effective protective strategies, and what the public is likely to do? These are questions that can only be addressed empirically, under field or laboratory simulation conditions. An ability to anticipate and predict human behavior and economic patterns to protect against or respond to an emergency event will guide us to make better decisions about investing in risk reduction measures and taking appropriate actions at all levels from CI operators, to the public consumers for these CI services, to CI owners, and throughout government agencies that may be involved. This supports our strategic objective of an effective national COP for real-time, accurate monitoring and decision support. d) Risk Communication and Manage- ment Disasters and other extreme events such as terrorism, first take their toll in death, injury and disability. Individuals, families, com- munities, organizations and agencies all are affected by such events - indeed, what we have learned since September 11, 2001 is that the degree of exposure to such events may have little predictive power for the fi- nal breadth of the impact. The perception of risk depends upon a per- son's role with respect to the danger, which has important implications for the work-force critical to infrastructure protection. If people voluntarily expose themselves to a hazard, or are familiar with a hazard, then they are more likely to underestimate the risk. Both these characteristics may be de-scriptive of many of the critical infrastruc-ture operators and users. However, if a hazard is imposed on them, people are more likely to overestimate the risk. This may be problematic in that even for a dedicated and trained workforce, the changing nature of terrorist attacks may make workers feel less prepared - and thus, more imposed upon - than those events that are predictable and for which specific training was offered. The creation of a solid database regarding human and social behavior that can be used to inform preparation strategies is central to 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Prot ection Research and Development Plan 67 the development of a robust capability to conduct threat assessment and prepare for terrorism. Geospatial, demographic, eco- nomic, and health-related data are essential to draw well-founded patterns from these knowledge bases. This effort requires an understanding of the impacts of the development of large-scale databases with information about private citizens on both the American public and on the international community. Whatever is constructed and maintained must protect the individual and privacy rights of all the peo-ple included. To address quantitative information needs in communications about particular threat scenarios, empirical research is needed to identify the public's and the officials' un-derstanding of very low probabilities of an event, cumulative risk effects, judgment anchoring, understanding of unfamiliar units and unfamiliar states. Measures should include assessment of knowledge, the ability to infer to new situations, and whether people have an appropriate level of confidence. Empirical data are needed to describe current beliefs, assess the value of possible message contents, design mes-sages, and evaluate their success and level of acceptability. Appropriate investment in protection and responses to emergencies are aspects of re- silient, self-healing infrastructure. An abil- ity to accurately model these behaviors sup-ports the CIP strategic goal of a national COP. Effective integration of federal, state, local, and private industry efforts to secure critical infrastructure and minimize poten- tial consequences will require new proc-esses of communication and collaboration. Achieving effective collaboration can help reduce the resources required to protect critical infrastructure. This collaboration will help us achieve an effective COP and realize more resilient CI systems with eco-nomically sustainable levels of investment in security. 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Protection Research and Development Plan 69 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES The efforts outlined in this plan will be spread over many years due to limits on annual investment and due to the fact that some efforts are intrinsically more difficult and take more time to accomplish. The results of the research activities related to critical infrastructure protection must ultimately fit into the skills, operational lim-its, and cost profiles of the owners of the assets. This means the results must reach commercial or near-commercial maturity to be accepted, and it must be expected that this will add time for technology transfer, market alignment, and other efforts. The R&D efforts and requirements dis- cussed in this plan have been gleaned from the best ideas of government agencies that in turn have been assembled from interac-tion with their respective industry sectors and industry organizations. The NCIP R&D Plan is not built around any specific collec- tion of near-term threats. It addresses a broad spectrum of threats. The require-ments presume that any threat the intelli-gence community and industry sectors can envision as plausible should have an associ- ated set of protection and security measures defined, and the R&D required to make them readily available and effective. This plan takes a vast collection of possible problems and incidents, and the require- ments needed to provide solutions to them, and attempts to prioritize these based on three fundamental criteria for inclusion: First, are those research projects re- lated to the most catastrophic conse-quence events which may be less probable than others, but are still plausible and must be addressed? An example would be use of a weapon of mass destruction (WMD) on an asset or asset collection and the decontamination of the area af- fected. The second criterion for inclusion in the plan involves known threats us-ing weapons or actions that are well documented as terrorist tools or natural or accidental disaster-related events where there is high probabil- ity we will see their use or occur-rence. An example of these is the use of human- or vehicle-borne ex-plosives. The third criterion for inclusion in the plan involves those R&D needs where our current abilities to address these issues contain major gaps. In future years, the plan will be more ex- plicit about timelines and milestones for these efforts. This first year is devoted more strongly to establishing a strategic foundation on which to plan and build sub-sequent years with a known baseline from which to gauge remaining gaps and needs. The following lists of priorities for R&D projects come from the best thinking of, and extensive interaction with, representatives from all agency members in the Infrastruc-ture Subcommittee of the National Science and Technology Council. As the many fac- tors change that are related to both the rea- sons for the R&D, and the knowledge gained through it, some of these may be replaced by activities whose priorities are increased based on intelligence gathered by others. However, many of these programs will require substantial sustained effort to achieve their full goal. The starting and stopping of these efforts based on changes in threats or perpetrators can in itself be damaging and add greatly to costs and re- source losses. For this reason, extra effort was expended to ensure that a baseline set of efforts was well aligned with strategic goals, and with expectations and knowledge about adversaries to this country. 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Protection Research and Development Plan 70 Priorities for R&D Projects Each of the following was judged to be both strongly needed and achievable in a fairly short timeframe. Some, such as advanced risk modeling and simulation, represent steps in what will be a continuing evolution of methods and technol ogy that will move as fast as resources and knowledge allow. Others are spot efforts that can be con-cluded and implemented within a year. Improve Sensor Performance Develop improved physical and cy- ber monitoring and detection sys-tems that will include improvements in speed, fewer false-positive read-ings, reduced power requirements, increased durability, and lower cost. These sensors will have increased sensitivity, be environmentally aware, have higher accuracy, and in-clude both active and passive sen-sors and robotic platforms. Im-proved sensitivity of detectors for explosives is particularly vital, espe- cially at long distances. Advance Risk Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis for Decision Support Improved capabilities in this area will address all critical infrastructure sectors and their interdependencies. Create computer models and algo- rithms accessible to owners and op-erators of critical infrastructure that are interoperable and use common inputs and assumptions. Standardize vulnerability analysis and risk analysis of critical infra- structure sectors and key assets. Develop the foundations for quanti- tative and economics-based security and risk assessment. Test, demonstrate and pilot new pro- jects to inform and train owners and operators of critical infrastructure. Conduct quantitative risk assess- ments to better quantify terrorism risks to critical infrastructure and key resources and assets, including an emphasis in the cyber domain. Broaden the application of inte- grated modeling, simulation, and analysis for real-time decision sup- port and planning. Provide public awareness of the risks, how they are being addressed, and how decisions are being made involving investment, threats, and value to the Nation. Improve Cyber Security Develop new methods for protection from, automated detection of, re-sponse to, and recovery from attacks on critical information infrastructure systems. Advance the security of basic Inter- net communication protocols. Foster migration to a more secure Internet infrastructure and guide de-velopment of next-generation secu-rity for IP-based (Internet Protocol-based) process control systems and services. Develop software engineering meth- ods and tools to support software as-surance and more inherently secure software development. Improve Prevention and Protection Develop new, low-cost physical pe- rimeter defense systems for critical infrastructure sectors, including sys- tems to mitigate high-explosive blast, projectile, and fire threats. Develop improved portal access and 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Protection Research and Development Plan 71 control systems for Chemical, Bio- logical, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Explosive (CBRNE) detection, weapon detection, and personnel identification and authentication. Develop methods for economical hardening of critical physical infra-structures. Develop enhanced monitoring and interpretation systems for automated protection, intrusion prevention and detection, and surveillance in both the physical and cyber domains. Better Address the Insider Threat Improve technologies such as intent determination and anomalous behav-ior monitoring for insider threat de- tection, covering physical and cyber infrastructures. These build toward integrated methods of personnel surety, document authentication, and access authorization. Improve Large-scale Situational Aware- ness for Critical Infrastructure Define the communication and com- puting system architecture needed to create a national common operating picture (COP) of the Nation's criti- cal infrastructures. Begin to implement multi-database monitoring systems that feed mod-els, train decision support systems, and provide information to protec-tion and response personnel. The bulk of these systems will continue to contain legacy technology for which interfacing may be the best that can be to improve security. These legacy elements are not al-ways capable of integration or intel- ligent collaboration. Provide prototype COP systems in- cluding dynamic situational aware-ness and interpretation. Dynamic algorithms can adapt and learn as they encounter situations. This is especially critical in a terrorist cir- cumstance where the use of rigid profiling and template situational analysis may be too simplistic. Provide real-time distributed data collection, visualization, and inter-pretation. Use pilot studies and test beds to begin to integrate network architectures consisting of sensors, controls, real-time data/information, and systems to have uniform struc-tures and common languages, inter-operability, compatibility, and scal- ability. Develop Next-Generation Designs and Architecture for Devices and Systems Develop next-generation infrastruc- tural concepts, architectures and sys-tems, both physical to in- clude designed-in and built-in secu- rity. Create tools and methodologies to support the development of such systems. Systems must become reli-able, autonomic (self-repairing and self-sustaining), resilient, and sur- vivable in order to continue to oper-ate in diminished capacity rather than failing in crisis conditions. Sensor networks and advanced ma-terials will be fused into these auto- nomic systems. Continue development of advanced, economical materials and designs for inherently resilient, self-healing, physical infrastructure. Advance physical infrastructure de- sign and construction methods in light of emerging threats, new mate- rials, and resiliency concepts. 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Protection Research and Development Plan 72 Develop a Human-Technology Interface that Allows Better Comprehension and Decisions Develop improved systems and processes that address the interface that necessarily occurs between peo-ple and technology. Provide an integrated view of socie- tal risks from terrorist events, natural disasters, and other emergencies for incorporation in decision support systems to anticipate and evaluate alternative risk reduction invest- ments and emergency response deci-sions. The efforts listed above are all needed to accomplish the strategic goals of CIP R&D. Aggressively pursuing these goals over the next decade will provide clear benefits to the Nation's critical infrastructure sectors, and doing so will also create broad-based spillover benefits, enabling non-critical in- frastructure to acquire, use, and benefit from the new technologies in order to en-hance their operational, economic, and per-sonnel security. 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Protection Research and Development Plan 73 SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS Policy/Statutory/Agency Issues A number of non-technical issues can im- pede the progress of making the Nation's critical infrastructures secure, just as surely as the limits of physics, chemistry, or biol-ogy can do so. These require unique col-laboration and communication across al-most every level and substructure of the Nation to fully solve. The most visible of these include: lack of well-established processes for information sharing between the federal government, state and local governments, and the private sector; the lack of new insurance and liabil- ity incentives for private sector to increase security; the lack of mechanisms to address business drivers that have removed most margins for redundancy and re-siliency; the tension that arises when the need for increased security is weighed against a desire to maintain an open society and protect personal free-doms and privacy; and the lack of established processes for technology transfer and diffusion of federally funded technology and in- tellectual property into commercial products and services that are used by state, local, and private sector in-frastructure owners and operators These issues must be addressed proactively as the science and technology efforts pro- ceed. This is essential to successfully mini-mize risks and barriers. Agencies' Roles and Responsi- bilities Protecting the Nation's critical infrastruc- ture sectors will require support, knowledge and contribution from almost every office of government, from industry and contrac- tors, and from the military. All elements of the country must work together, and with our international partners, to achieve critical infrastructure protection. As part of this effort, many federal agencies have unique responsibilities to perform homeland secu-rity-related activities. For instance, con-tinuous updates on threat information must be received from the intelligence commu-nity. The private sector and own- ers/operators of the critical infrastructures must continue to improve the degree to which they work together and with the fed-eral government through sector coordinat-ing councils, Information Sharing and Analysis Centers, and industry associations. HSPD-7 is the primary resource document for defining agency roles and responsibili-ties in the protection of the Nation's critical infrastructures. The Department of Home-land Security is responsible for coordinating the overall national effort to enhance the protection of the critical infrastructures and key resources of the United States. Sector-specific agencies are responsible for some aspects of assessment and protection within their assigned sectors: Department of Agriculture (USDA) - agriculture (plants and animals), aquaculture and silviculture, as well as food (meat, poultry and eggs); overall pre-harvest and post-harvest food safety, Health and Human Services - public health, healthcare, and all food ex-cept that covered by USDA, 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Protection Research and Development Plan 74 Environmental Protection Agency - drinking water and wastewater treatment systems, Department of Energy - energy ex- cept for nuclear power facilities, Department of the Treasury - bank- ing and finance, Department of the Interior - na- tional monuments and icons, Department of Defense - defense industrial base, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) - information technology, telecommunications, the chemical sector, transportation systems, emer- gency services, postal and shipping, dams, and government and commer-cial facilities, and Nuclear Regulatory Commission - commercial nuclear reactors, materi- als, and waste. In addition, HSPD-7 defines special func- tions for other federal departments and agencies as well as components of the Ex-ecutive Office of the President: Department of State - international coordination, Department of Justice - reduce do- mestic terrorist threats, Department of Commerce - work with the private sector, Homeland Security Council - inter- agency policy, Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) - interagency R&D, Office of Management and Budget - interagency implementation, and Department of Transportation - co- ordination with DHS on the trans-portation systems sector. DHS is responsible for developing and im- plementing a comprehensive National In- frastructure Protection Plan . Working with OSTP, DHS is also responsible for develop-ing this annual NCIP R&D Plan to support HSPD-7. 2004 National Critical Infrastructure Protection Research and Development Plan 75 REFERENCES The following list represents a number of valuable r esources that were used to assemble this plan: Department of Homeland Security.
