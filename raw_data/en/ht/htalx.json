Rihmland, MD", "date": "2022-06-08", "cleaned_text": "are there and tell them, 'The Kingdom of God has come near to you'.\" -Luke 10:9 Dr. Rihmland has been treating patients in the Washington County area since 1995. Her passion is to use all the tools she has gathered and help patients in an integrative and comprehensive way with their various medical issues. She was one of those fortunate people to feel a very strong calling, already at the age of fourteen, to become a doctor and help people. With various opportunities to \"try out\" medicine, such as job shadowing, working at a Pediatrician's office, volunteering, doing research, and then getting to spend a summer working with a rural family doctor in Maine, her desire and passion to help people only grew more. While at Case Western Reserve Medical School, she had some wonderful Family Practice mentors who taught her to think outside the box, to really attend to patients' mind-body-spiritual needs, and to tailor treatment plans that were unique to each patient. That included adding on complementary therapies to the standard or conventional treatments learned in medical school. She graduated from Case Western with her M.D. Degree in 1995 and won the Donald E. Minch Award of \"Medical Student Who Most Exemplified the Ideals of Family Medicine\". She then completed her internship and residency in Family Practice at The Washington Hospital from 1995 to 1998. Her passion for helping and healing people stays strong. She is so grateful for the privilege to impact and share in the lives of her patients. Spiritually, she feels very blessed and honored to be able to care for so many wonderful patients who have been her greatest teachers. She is committed to continue learning new tools that would be appropriate in caring for patients of all ages using an Integrative model of Family Practice which combines both conventional or traditional therapies with complementary or natural medicine as needed or appropriate.
