Beck!\"](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/podcast/biohacking-podcasts/the-anthony-beck-podcast/) Another 3 years have gone by and I'm psyched to be welcoming Dr. Beck back to the podcast to discuss his unique [Balance Protocol](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/balanceprotocol) approach to health and medicine, including his top tips for optimizing your air, light, water, sound, EMF, food, and much more. [Dr. Anthony G. Beck](https://balanceprotocolinstitute.com/) is an author, speaker, and leader in the medical world with over 27 years of experience in the areas of Integrative and Functional Medicine, Chinese Medicine, Clinical Nutrition, Orthomolecular Medicine, Hormone Replacement Therapy, Sports Medicine, and Exercise Physiology. He has earned four national medical board certifications and an international fellowship. Dr. Beck is the Medical Director for Balance Protocol Foundation, which provides benevolent health care for U.S. military special forces operators and their families, and is the founder and chief medical officer for [Balance Protocol Institute](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/balanceprotocol), a preceptorship training program for practitioners and clinicians who desire to learn how to wield the powerful clinical method known as Balance Protocol. As a physician who has practiced Integrative and Functional Medicine for over 27 years, Dr. Anthony G. Beck doesn't merely manage diseases\u2014he helps people resolve them. With an extensive education in many clinical disciplines such as Integrative Medicine, Functional Medicine, Clinical Nutrition, Systems Biology, Epigenetics, and Nutrigenomics, Dr. Beck takes a dynamic approach to assessing, educating, and working with his patients to achieve their highest levels of well-being. Even more importantly, Dr. Beck looks to educate and empower patients to demand a higher level of care from their health care providers. Dr. Beck's methods involve an array of aspects including a healthful lifestyle design, individualized nutrition, hormone balancing, resolving immune dysfunction and hidden infectious diseases, extensive laboratory and functional testing, detoxification, and preventative medicine. In this podcast, we discuss the principles and practice of Dr. Beck's [Balance Protocol](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/balanceprotocol) program, along with biotransformation, water filtration, wearables, and much more!
