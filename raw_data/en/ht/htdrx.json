Nicholas Fuller Nicholas is from a town called Centre Hall in Rural Central Pennsylvania. He then traveled to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he attended the University of Pittsburgh, graduating with a BA in philosophy and a BS in neuroscience in December 2019. Initially unsure what he should study in college, Nicholas quickly learned that he had a deep appreciation for basic science and its applications in neuroscience and joined a research lab studying neuroplasticity and addiction. Concurrently, Nicholas also continued to develop a growing interest in the humanities with his study of philosophy, particularly focusing on ethics and Judeo-Christian theology. Studying ethics has greatly informed his conceptualization of medicine as well as his work during the two years he spent as a nursing assistant in the medical ICU of West Penn Hospital in Pittsburgh. While Nicholas intends to live and practice in a rural setting for the majority of his medical career, the five years he spent living in a city taught him a great deal about the many inequalities that exist throughout our society, but which are more clearly apparent in an urban setting. The combination of his lived experience within more racially and economically diverse environments paired with the content he has learned through his education has given him an appreciation for many social issues on which he intends to make a positive impact. Specifically, he would like to take what he has learned and return to a rural community like the one he comes in order to help make it a better place for everyone to live in whatever small ways he can.
