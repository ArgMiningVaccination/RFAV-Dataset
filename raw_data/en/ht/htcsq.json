No differences emerge in women and men's fundraising receipts, vote totals, or electoral success. Yet women remain severely under-represented in U.S. political institutions. We argue that the fundamental reason for women's under-representation is that they do not run for office. There is a substantial gender gap in political ambition; men tend to have it, and women don't. We arrive at this conclusion by analyzing data from a brand new survey of nearly 4,000 male and female \"potential candidates\" - lawyers, business leaders, educators, and political activists, all of whom are well-situated to pursue a political candidacy - and comparing our results to a survey we conducted in 2001. Despite the emergence over the past ten years of high-profile women in politics, such as Nancy Pelosi, Hillary Clinton, and Sarah Palin, we find that the gender gap in political ambi-tion is virtually the same as it was a decade ago. The gender gap in interest in a future candidacy has actually increased. Ultimately, we identify seven factors that contribute to the gender gap - either by directly impeding women's political ambition, or by making the decision calculus far more complex and complicated for women than men: Given the persistent gender gap in political ambition, we are a long way from a political reality in which women and men are equally likely to aspire to attain high level elective office. To be sure, both major political parties are running a record number of female candidates for the U.S. Senate in 2012. But women, assuming they win their primaries, will still compete in fewer than one-third of all races. Thus, even if 2012 is a \"banner year\" for female candidates, it will likely still amount only to a 1 to 2 percentage point increase in number of women serving in the U.S. Congress. Certainly, recruiting female candidates and disseminating information about the electoral environment can help narrow the gender gap in ambition and increase women's representation. But many barri-ers to women's interest in running for office can be overcome only with major cultural and political changes. In the end, this report documents how far from gender parity we remain, as well as the barri-ers and obstacles we must still surmount in order to achieve it. Women are substantially more likely than men to perceive the electoral environment 1. as highly competitive and biased against female candidates. Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin's candidacies aggravated women's perceptions of 2. gender bias in the electoral arena. Women are much less likely than men to think they are qualified to run for office. 3. Female potential candidates are less competitive, less confident, and more risk 4. averse than their male counterparts. Women react more negatively than men to many aspects of modern campaigns. 5. Women are less likely than men to receive the suggestion to run for office 6. - from anyone. Women are still responsible for the majority of childcare and household tasks.7. Men Rule The Continued Under-Representation of Women in U.S. Politics | 1 Men Rule: The Continued Under-Representation of Women in U.S. Politics As of the 1970s, women occupied almost no major elective positions in U.S. political institutions. Ella Grasso, a Democrat from Connecticut, and Dixie Lee Ray, a Democrat from Washington, served as the only two women elected governor throughout the decade. Not until 1978 did Kansas Republican Nancy Kassebaum become the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate in her own right. By 1979, women comprised fewer than five percent of the seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, and only about ten percent of state legislative positions across the country. Today, if we glance at the television screen, peruse the newspaper, listen to the radio, or scan the Internet, we might be tempted to conclude that women have made remarkable gains. Nancy Pelosi currently serves as the Minority Leader in the U.S. House of Representatives. Secretary of State (and former U.S. Senator) Hillary Clinton not only received 18 million votes when she sought the Demo-cratic nomination for president, but she also has the highest favorability ratings of any member of the Obama Administration. And in 2011, polls repeatedly placed former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin in the top tier of potential candidates for the Republican presidential nomination. But these famous faces obscure the dearth of women who hold elective office in the United States. When the 112th Congress convened in January 2011, 84 percent of its members were men. The per-centages of women office holders presented in Table 1 demonstrate that it is not only at the federal level that women are numerically under-represented. Large gender disparities are also evident at the state and local levels, where more than three-quarters of statewide elected officials and state legisla-tors are men. Further, men occupy the governor's mansion in 44 of the 50 states, and men run City Hall in 92 of the 100 largest cities across the country. The low numbers of women in politics are particularly glaring when we place them in con-text. Whereas the 1980s saw gradual, but steady increases in the percent-age of women seeking elected office, and the early 1990s experienced a sharper surge, the last several election cycles can be characterized as a plateau. Indeed, the 2010 congressional elections resulted in the first net decrease in the percentage of women serving in the U.S. House of Representatives since the 1978 midterm elections. The number of women elected to state legislatures, which act as key launching pads to higher office, also suffered the largest single year decline in 2010. Moreover, while many nations around the world make progress increasing women's presence in posi- tions of political power, the United States has not kept pace; 90 nations now surpass the U.S. in the percentage of women in the national legislature (see Table 2). Certainly, cultural and political compo- Table 1 Women Office Holders in the United States Office Office Percent Women Sources: Women & Politics Institute, American University; and Center for American Women and Politics, Rutgers University.U.S. Senators 17.0 Members of the U.S. House of Representatives 16.8 State Governors 12.0 Statewide Elected Officials 22.4 State Legislators 23.6 Mayors of the 100 Largest Cities 8.02 | Lawless and Fox nents factor into the total number of women who hold seats in any nation's legislature, but more than 50 democratic countries rank higher than the United States in women's representation. It should come as no surprise, therefore, that women's under-representation in American politics raises grave concerns regarding democratic legitimacy and fundamental issues of political represen-tation. Electing more women increases the likelihood that policy debates and deliberations include women's views and experiences. Further, political theorists and practitioners alike often ascribe symbolic or role model benefits to a more diverse body of elected officials (see Appendix A for current research on the substantive and symbolic benefits female candidates and elected officials bring to the political sphere). In light of the importance of women's presence in politics, it is critical to understand why so few women hold public office in the United States. Somewhat surprisingly, it is not because of discrimina-tion against female candidates. In fact, women perform as well as men when they run for office. In terms of fundraising and vote totals, the consensus among researchers is the absence of overt gender bias on Election Day. When women run for office - regardless of the position they seek - they are just as likely as their male counterparts to win their races. 1Table 2 Worldwide Rankings of Women in the National Legislature Rank and Country Percent Women 1.

Men Rule The Continued Under-Representation of Women in U.S. Politics | 3 We argue that the fundamental reason for women's under-representation is that they do not run for office. There is a substantial gender gap in political ambition; men tend to have it, and women don't.2 And the gender gap in ambition is persistent and unchanging. We arrive at this conclusion by analyz-ing data we collected in 2001 and 2011 from thousands of male and female \"potential candidates\" - lawyers, business leaders, educators, and political activists, all of whom are well-situated to pursue a political candidacy. In addition to highlighting the persistent gender gap in political ambition, we identify seven factors that continue to hinder women's full entrance into electoral politics. In the end, this report documents how far from gender parity we remain and the barriers and obstacles we must still overcome in order to achieve it. Studying Political Ambition In order to reconcile the contradiction between a political system that elects few women and an electoral environment that is unbiased against female candidates, we developed and conducted the Citizen Political Ambition Study, a series of mail surveys and interviews with women and men in the pool of potential candidates. Our goal was to conduct a nuanced investigation of how women and men initially decide to run for all levels and types of political office, either now or in the future. 3 The original survey, carried out in 2001, served as the first national study of the initial decision to run for office. Based on mail survey responses from 1,969 men and 1,796 women, we concluded that women were less likely than their male counter-parts to consider running for office and that, across generations, men expressed more comfort and felt greater freedom than women when thinking about seeking office. 4 But a lot has happened in the last ten years. The events of September 11, 2001, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Nancy Pelosi's election as the first female Speaker of the House, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's 2008 battle for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sarah Palin's vice presidential candidacy, and the rise of the Tea Party movement are only among the many recent developments that might affect interest in running for office. For some people, the current political climate might motivate them to take action. For others, the effect might be increased cynicism and disengagement from politics. In either case, the altered political landscape, coupled with the continuing need to understand why women do not run for office, motivated us to conduct a new wave of the Citizen Political Ambition Study. In 2011, we completed a survey of a new sample of potential candidates. The samples of women and men are roughly equal in terms of race, region, education, household income, profession, political participation, and interest in politics (see Appendix B for a description of the sampling procedures and response rates). Thus, our sample of 1,925 men and 1,843 women allows us to shed new light on the gender gap in political ambition. The Persistent Gender Gap in Political Ambition Put simply, men and women do not have equal interest in seeking elective office. In the 2001 survey, we found strong evidence that gender plays a substantial role in the candidate emergence process. \"We argue that the fundamental reason for women's under-representation is that they do not run for office. There is a substantial gender gap in political ambition; men tend to have it, and women don't.\"4 | Lawless and Fox Overall, more than half of the respondents (51 percent) stated that the idea of running for an elective position had at least \"crossed their mind.\" Turning to the respondents who considered a candidacy, though, the data presented in Figure 1 highlight a significant gender gap among the 2001 respon-dents: men were 16 percentage points more likely than women to have considered running for office. 5 Notably, this gender gap persisted across political party, income level, age, race, profession, and region. 6 The political environment may have changed throughout the last decade, but the gender gap in politi-cal ambition in 2011 is striking, and just as large as it was a decade ago (see the center columns in Figure 1). Remarkably, despite the changing political landscape and the emergence of several high-profile female candidates between 2001 and 2011, women remain 16 percentage points less likely than men to have thought about running for office. Notes: Bars represent the percentage of women and men who responded that they had \"seriously considered\" or \"considered\" running for office (this includes respondents who actually ran for office). The gender gap is significant at p < .05 in both the 2001 and 2011 comparisons. When we turn to future interest in office-holding, the prospects for women's full inclusion in electoral politics are even bleaker. Figure 2 demonstrates that the gender gap in future interest in running for office has actually grown over the course of the last ten years. More specifically, while men's inter-est in a future candidacy remained virtually unchanged across the ten year period, women's interest dropped; 18 percent of women in 2001, compared to 14 percent of women in 2011, expressed inter-est in running for office at some point in the future.\"The political environment may have changed throughout the last decade, but the gender gap in political ambition in 2011 is striking, and just as large as it was a decade ago.\" Figure 1 The Enduring Gender Gap in Political Ambition: Have You Ever Considered Running for Office? Men Rule The Continued Under-Representation of Women in U.S. Politics | 5 Notes: Bars represent the percentage of women and men who responded that they were \"definitely\" interested in running for office at some point in the future, or that they would be interested \"if the opportunity presented itself.\" The gender gap is significant at p < .05 in both the 2001 and 2011 comparisons. Women are not only less likely than men to consider a candidacy - both retrospectively and prospec-tively - but they are also less likely than men to take any of the steps required to launch an actual political campaign. Figure 3 reveals that men are significantly more likely than women to have inves-tigated how to place their name on the ballot, discussed running with party or community leaders, or spoken with family members, friends, and potential supporters about a possible candidacy. Notes: Bars represent the percentage of women and men who answered affirmatively for each activity. The gender gap is significant at p < .05 for all comparisons. Figure 2 The Enduring Gender Gap in Political Ambition: Are You Interested in Running for Office in the Future? Figure 3 The Gender Gap in Steps Taken That Typically Precede a Candidacy6 | Lawless and Fox Finally, if we turn to the specific offices in which respondents express interest, then we uncover another dimension of the gender gap in political ambition. When prompted to consider running for office, women and men do not express comparable levels of interest in all positions (see Table 3). At the local level, women are more likely than men to report interest in a school board position. But men are approximately 40 percent more likely than women to consider running for the state legislature. And men are roughly twice as likely as women to express interest in a federal position. The 2011 gender gap in political ambition - based on a variety of measures - is roughly the same magnitude as it was in 2001. Women today remain just as unlikely, relative to men, as women ten years ago to consider running for office. The remainder of this report sheds light on why this may be the case and speaks to seven gender dynamics in the political arena that work to women's detriment. Seven Factors that Hinder Prospects for Gender Parity in Elective Office The following seven findings highlight the difficult road ahead as the United States continues the climb toward gender parity in elective office. Several of the findings link directly to political ambition and gender differences in women and men's perceptions of themselves as candidates. Others tap into the more complex set of factors women face when contemplating a candidacy. But all seven demon-strate that because of deeply embedded patterns of gender roles and norms, becoming a candidate will remain a far less appealing and feasible option for women than men, at least for the foreseeable future.Table 3 Gender Differences in Office Preferences Notes: Entries indicate the percentage of respondents who would ever consider running for each position.

Women are substantially more likely than men to perceive the electoral environment as highly competitive and biased against female candidates. As we mentioned at the outset of this report, when women run for office, they are just as likely as men to win their races. The reality of gender neutral election outcomes, however, may not mitigate the gendered perceptual lens through which women view the electoral process. That is, if women think the system is biased against them, then the empirical reality of a playing field on which women can succeed is almost meaningless. And this is exactly what we find. To shed light on gender differences in perceptions of the electoral system, we asked respondents the extent to which they regard their local and congressional election landscapes competitive. Because the women and men are geographically matched, differences in responses reflect perceptual, not actual, differences in levels of competition. The data presented in the top half of Table 4 indicate that a majority of women judge their local and congressional elections as \"highly competitive.\" Women are roughly 25 percent more likely than men to assess the political landscape this way. Further, more than half the women in the sample do not believe that women who run for office fare as well as their male counterparts. Seven out of ten women doubt that female candidates raise as much money as similarly situated men. Men are significantly more likely than women to perceive lower lev-els of both electoral competition and gender bias against women in politics. There may be no systematic bias against female candidates on Election Day, but the aggregate per- centages of women and men who perceive a biased system are striking. And as far as considering a candidacy is concerned, perceptions often trump reality. 2. Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin's candidacies aggravated women's perceptions of gender bias in the electoral arena. When Hillary Clinton announced her presidential candidacy at the end of 2007, she became the first female presidential candidate who was regarded as a frontrunner with a chance to win her party's nomi-nation. In fact, her hotly contested battle with eventual winner Barack Obama dominated political news coverage for the first five months of 2008. Sarah Palin's 2008 vice-presidential candidacy also propelled Table 4 Gender Differences in Perceptions of the Electoral Environment Notes: Entries indicate the percentage of respondents who answered affirmatively.

As the second female vice presidential candidate - Geraldine Ferraro was Walter Mondale's running mate in 1984 - and the first Republican, Palin garnered widespread attention. Although Clinton and Palin shared little in terms of their political preferences, they both regularly ref-erenced the manner in which their victories would be historic. On June 7, 2008, for example, when Hillary Clinton took to the podium for what would be her last speech as a presidential candidate, she spoke very openly about what her candidacy meant for women's political progress: \"You can be so proud that, from now on, it will be unremarkable for a woman to win primary state victories, unre-markable to have a woman in a close race to be our nominee, unremarkable to think that a woman can be the President of the United States. And that is truly remarkable.\" 7 Nearly three months later, during her first speech as the Republican Party's vice presidential candidate, Sarah Palin uttered very similar words. She reminded her supporters at a Dayton, Ohio, rally that \"Hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest, hardest glass ceiling in America. But it turns out that the women of America aren't finished yet, and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all.\" 8 But Clinton and Palin's campaigns also provided many potential candidates with a window into how women are treated when they run for office. And what women of both political parties saw likely confirmed some of their worst fears about the electoral arena. More specifically, the data presented in Figure 4 reveal that roughly two-thirds of female potential candidates believe that Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin were subjected to sexist media coverage. Further, majorities of female respondents con-tend that, during the campaigns, too much attention was paid to Clinton and Palin's appearances. In terms of perceptions of bias, roughly half of the female potential candidates believe that Sarah Palin faced gender bias from voters; more than 80 percent feel the same way about Hillary Clinton. 9 Notes: Bars represent the percentage of women who agreed with each statement. For all categories, women were statistically more likely than men (at p < .05) to contend that Clinton and Palin experienced sexist treatment and / or gender bias (comparisons with men not shown). Overall, to the degree that Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin's high-profile candidacies served as a civic education project about women who run for office, they appear to have reinforced, or perhaps exacer-bated, negative perceptions of the way women are received in the electoral arena. Figure 4 Female Eligible Candidates' Perceptions of Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin's Experiences in 2008 Men Rule The Continued Under-Representation of Women in U.S. Politics | 9 3. Women are much less likely than men to think they are qualified to run for office. Our 2001 study revealed that one of the biggest barriers keeping women from emerging as candi- dates centered around self-perceptions of qualifications to run for office. In 2011, the same dynamic emerges. Consistent with the findings from ten years ago, the data presented in Figure 5 indicate that men remain almost 60 percent more likely than women to assess themselves as \"very qualified\" to run for office. Women in the sample are more than twice as likely as men to rate themselves as \"not at all qualified.\" Importantly, the gender gap in perceptions of qualifications to run for office does not stem from gen- der differences in direct political experiences or exposure to, and familiarity with, the political arena. Twenty-three percent of women and 26 percent of men have conducted extensive policy research; 69 percent of women and 74 percent of men regularly engage in public speaking; and 75 percent of women and 70 percent of men report experience soliciting funds. In addition, more than 80 percent of the women and men in the sample have attended political meetings and events. Two-thirds have served on the boards of non-profit organizations and foundations. And roughly three-quarters have interacted with elected officials in some professional capacity. Notes: Entries indicate the percentage of women and men who self-assess at each level of qualifications to run for office. The gender gap is statistically significant at p < .05 for all comparisons. Women's self-doubts are important not only because they speak to deeply embedded gendered per-ceptions, but also because they play a much larger role than do men's in depressing the likelihood of considering a candidacy. More specifically, among women who self-assess as \"not at all qualified\" to run for office, only 39 percent have considered throwing their hats into the ring. Among men who do not think they are qualified to run for office, 55 percent have given the notion of a candidacy some thought. Because gender differences in perceptions of qualifications correlate with respondents' assessments of their own electoral prospects, women are significantly less likely than men to think they would win their first campaign. Thirty-one percent of female potential candidates, compared to 38 percent of men, think it would be \"likely\" or \"very likely\" that they would win their first race if they ran for office. Alternatively, women are approximately 50 percent more likely than men to think the odds of winning their first race would be \"very unlikely.\" Figure 5 Self-Assessments of Qualifications to Run for Public Office10 | Lawless and Fox Certainly, because women are more likely than men to view the electoral process as biased against them, self-doubt regarding their qualifications and more pessimistic perceptions of the likelihood of winning may simply be a rational response to what women perceive as a more challenging political context. But the overwhelming majority of people - women and men - do not run for office unless they believe that they have a chance of winning. Hence, women's lower self-assessments carry direct consequences for their numeric representation. 4. Female potential candidates are less competitive, less confident, and more risk averse than their male counterparts. Entering the electoral arena involves the courageous step of putting oneself before the public, often only to face intense examination, loss of privacy, possible rejection, and disruption from regular routines and pursuits. This decision, even for experienced politicians, requires character traits such as confidence, competitiveness, and risk-taking - characteristics that men have traditionally been encouraged to embrace and women to eschew. As the data presented in Table 5 reveal, women are significantly less likely than men to report that they have the traits that are generally required of candidates for elective office. In terms of thick skin, an entrepreneur - ial spirit, and a willingness to take risks, men are at least 25 percent more likely than women to believe that they possess the political trait in question. The same pattern persists when we move from abstract self-assessments of traits to specific scenarios that tap into risk aversion and competitiveness. When presented with a risky investment opportunity, for Table 5 Self Assessment of Politically-Relevant Traits Do you consider yourself . . . .?

Men are more than 20 percent more likely than women to report that winning a low-stakes game with a friend or colleague is important. These findings suggest that men's longer presence and success in top positions in the professions from which candidates tend to emerge may result in (or reinforce) levels of confidence about entering the political arena, also a male-dominated environment. Clearly, women and men perceive political reality, their political attributes, and their ability to succeed in the political system through a gendered lens. 5. Women react more negatively than men to many aspects of modern campaigns. Political candidates must engage in a number of different activities and often endure a series of sometimes difficult personal circumstances. We provided respondents with a list of five activities that pertain to the mechanics of a campaign and two examples of the personal toll a campaign might take. The data, presented in Table 7, indicate that women are statistically more likely than men to view four of the five typical campaign activities so negatively that they are deterrents to running for office. More specifically, women exhibit more negative attitudes than men toward fundraising, voter contact, deal-ing with the press, and engaging in a negative campaign. Turning to the personal aspects of a cam-paign, women are significantly more likely than men to be deterred from running for office because of the potential loss of privacy and concerns about spending less time with their families. Overall, 41 percent of men, compared to 52 percent of women, were deterred by at least one typi- cal campaign activity (difference significant at p < .05). Women, therefore, have significantly more negative feelings than men toward the various aspects of a campaign that they must reconcile when considering running for office. 10 6. Women are less likely than men to receive the suggestion to run for office - from anyone. Recruitment and encouragement lead many individuals who otherwise might never consider running for office to emerge as candidates. Ten years ago, women were far less likely than men to report being Table 7 Attitudes about Engaging in Campaign Activities Women Men Notes: Entries indicate the percentage of respondents who view each activity so negatively that it serves as a deterrent to running for office.

Over the course of last decade, however, many women's organizations burst onto the political scene. They vary in mission and target group, but collectively, these organizations endeavor to move more women into the networks from which candidates emerge. 11 Indeed, 22 percent of the women in our sample report some contact with a women's organization whose mission is to promote women's candidacies. Yet the gender gap in political recruitment remains substantial. To compare women and men's political recruitment experiences, we asked respondents if anyone ever suggested that they run for office. We broke the possible sources of political recruitment into two cat-egories: \"political actors,\" which we define as party officials, elected officials, and political activists; and \"non-political actors,\" defined as colleagues, spouses / partners, family members, and religious connections. The data presented in Figures 6 and 7 reveal that women remain less likely than men to have received the suggestion to run for office, regardless of the source. Notes: Bars represent the percentage of women and men who were recruited to run for office by each political actor.

From local, to state, to federal positions, women were significantly less likely than men to report ever receiving the suggestion to run for office (see Table 8). It is likely that these gender gaps are far smaller than would be the case if women's organizations did not strive to facilitate women's candidate emergence. But their efforts can do only so much. Party leaders, elected officials, political activists, and non-political actors continue to encourage far more men than women to enter the electoral arena. The lack of recruitment is a particularly powerful explanation for why women are less likely than men to consider a candidacy. Sixty-seven percent of respondents who have been encouraged to run by a party leader, elected official, or political activist have considered running, compared to 33 percent of respondents who report no such recruitment (difference significant at p < .05). The same pattern holds for non-political actors; whereas 78 percent of the potential candidates in our sample who have not received encouragement to run from a colleague, spouse, or family member have not considered a candidacy, 72 percent of respondents who have received such a suggestion have considered throw-ing their hats into the ring (difference significant at p < .05). Importantly, women are just as likely as men to respond favorably to the suggestion of a candidacy. They are just less likely than men to receive it. 7. Women are still responsible for the majority of childcare and household tasks. The results of our 2001 survey revealed that women were much more likely than men to be respon-sible for the majority of household work and childcare. Despite women's substantial movement into high-level positions in the professional arena, women and men continued to conform to traditional gender roles at home. Our 2011 survey data demonstrate that little has changed over the past ten years. Table 8 Gender Differences in Recruitment to Specific Offices Notes: Entries indicate the percentage of respondents who report ever receiving the suggestion to run for the office. The gender gap is significant at p < .05 for all comparisons. Women Men Local or Community Office School Board 18% 21% City Council 16 22 Mayor 6 10 District Attorney 1 2 State Level Office State Legislator 16 24 Statewide Office (i.e., State Treasurer) 1 2 Governor 1 4 Federal Office House of Representatives 4 10 Senate 2 4 Sample Size 1,766 1,84814 | Lawless and Fox Table 9 provides a breakdown of the respondents' family arrangements and distribution of household and childcare responsibilities. Women in the sample are significantly less likely than men to be mar-ried and have children. This suggests that some women who choose to become top-level professionals are more likely than men to de-emphasize traditional family structures and roles. Those women who are married and who do have children, however, tend to exhibit traditional gender role orientations. In families where both adults are working (generally in high-level careers), women are roughly six times more likely than men to bear responsibility for the majority of household tasks, and they are about ten times more likely to be the primary childcare provider. Notably, these differences in family responsi-bilities are not merely a matter of gendered perceptions. Both sexes fully recognize this organization of labor. More than 50 percent of men acknowledge that their spouses are responsible for a majority of household tasks and childcare, while only 7 percent of women make the same claim. This division of labor is consistent across political party lines. We also asked respondents how many hours they spend each day on various activities, including work, childcare, housework, and hobbies. Women and men work the same number of hours (roughly 9 hours per day), but women devote significantly more of their non-working time than men to household tasks and childcare. Whereas women report spending about 2.1 hours per day on household tasks, men report spending about 1.6 hours per day. Among respondents with children, women spend roughly two thirds more time each day than men on childcare (women spend 2.8 hours per day, compared to men, who spend 1.7 hours per day). Men spend more time exercising and pursuing their hobbies and interests (all of these gender differences are significant at p < .05). Hence, the data certainly suggest that women's lives are more hectic and confined than those of most of their male counterparts. Table 9 Gender Differences in Family Structures, Roles, and Responsibilities Notes: Number of cases varies slightly, as some respondents omitted answers to some questions. The household tasks data do not include respondents who are not married or living with a partner; and the childcare arrangements data do not include respondents who do not have children. * indicates that the gender gap is significant at p < .05.

But surprisingly, women's disproportionate familial responsibilities do not dramatically affect whether they have considered running for offi ce or express interest in running for offi ce in the future. Forty-eight percent of women who are responsible for the majority of the household tasks and childcare, for instance, have considered running for offi ce. Forty-fi ve percent of women who shoulder no such burdens have thought about a candidacy. In another example, 43 percent of women with children at home have considered a candidacy, compared to 46 percent of women without children at home. Neither of these small differences approaches conventional levels of statistical signifi cance. Our data suggest that the struggle to balance family roles with professional responsibilities has simply become part of the bargain for contemporary women. Of course, even if family structures and arrangements do not preclude women from thinking about a full range of lifetime career options, the circumstances under which such thoughts cross potential candidates' minds might differ for women and men. As one gender politics scholar so aptly characterized political ambition in the contemporary environment, \"Women may now think about running for offi ce, but they probably think about it while they are making the bed.\" 12 What emerges from this analysis of family roles and structures is the fact that women, though no longer directly impeded from thinking about a candidacy just because they have certain familial responsibilities, face a more complex set of choices than do their male counterparts. Where Do We Go From Here? Summary, Discussion, and Concluding Remarks In analyzing and summarizing this report's key fi ndings, we emphasize several important points: In both 2001 and 2011, we uncovered a profound gender gap in interest in seeking elective offi ce. Women of all professions, political parties, ages, and income levels are less likely than their male counterparts to express interest in running for offi ce. \"Surprisingly, women's disproportionate familial responsibilities do not dramatically affect whether they have considered running for offi ce or express interest in running for offi ce in the future...The struggle to balance family roles with professional responsibilities has simply become part of the bargain for contemporary women.\"16 | Lawless and Fox When we compare the 2011 results to the 2001 data, we see virtually no change in the gender gap in political ambition. Even more startling than the lack of progress in closing the gender gap in interest in seeking office is evidence that the disparity between women and men's ambition for a future candidacy has increased. A smaller ratio of women to men in 2011 than 2001 reported interest in entering the electoral arena at some point down the road. The gender gap in political ambition is driven by women's lower levels of political recruitment and lower self-assessments of political qualifications. In addition, women perceive an electoral environment that is biased against them, which likely helps explain their greater aversion to participating in the nuts and bolts of a campaign. Finally, the fact that women remain the primary caretakers of the home and children adds a high degree of complexity to the decision to run office - complexity that most men do not face. These findings from the Citizen Political Ambition Study cast a cloud over future prospects for gender parity in U.S. political institutions. Women's full inclusion in electoral politics depends on closing the gender gap in political ambition. But our 2011 survey data - which expand our understanding of the factors that play into the decision to run for office - indicate that women remain at a disadvantage on numerous dimensions. The new research presented in this report sheds important light on how women and men experience politics very differently. The offices to which potential candidates are recruited, their perceptions about critical character traits, such as confidence, competitiveness, thick skin, and an entrepreneurial spirit, and their perceptions of the electoral environment and the manner in which women are treated in it, all work to women's detriment. In addition, gender gaps in political recruit-ment and perceptions of qualifications continue to hinder women's interest in running for office just as much now as a decade ago. Given the persistent gender gap in political ambition, we are a long way from a political reality in which women and men are equally likely to aspire to attain high-level elective office. The 2012 elections, which are already being heralded as another great year for female candidates, are likely to result in only incremental changes to the number of women serving in the U.S. Congress. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has proudly announced that it is running more women in the 2012 cycle than in any previous election. But this record number still means that women - should they win their primary contests - will compete in fewer than one third of the Senate races in 2012. 13 The Republicans are also on track to run a record number of female candidates, although their raw numbers will pale in com-parison to the Democrats'. Thus, even if 2012 turns out to be a \"banner year\" for female candidates, and even if the majority of these women win their races, their victories will amount to, at most, a 1 to 2 percentage point increase in the seats held by women in the U.S. Congress. The problems that underlie women's numeric under-representation are more fundamental than the occasional attention that political parties pay to women's candidate emergence might suggest. Our findings, in essence, highlight the importance of deepening our understanding of the manner in which women and men in contemporary society are socialized about politics, the acquisition of political power, and the characteristics that qualify individuals to seek it. At a practical level, though, our find-ings offer some direction for people interested in increasing the number of women serving in office. First, the data reveal that although women are less likely than men ever to have considered running for office, they are just as likely as men to respond positively to political recruitment. Recruiting early and recruiting often are vital ingredients for closing the gender gap in political ambition. In fact, recruitment might be the only quick fix for party leaders, elected officials, and political activists to pursue. Second, a substantial barrier to entering politics for many female potential candidates is the perception of a biased and competitive electoral atmosphere. Yet many of these Men Rule The Continued Under-Representation of Women in U.S. Politics | 17 perceptions are not consistent with the reality that women are just as likely as men to succeed in the electoral arena. Spreading the word about women's electoral success and fundraising prowess can work to change potential candidates' perceptions of a biased electoral arena - perceptions that may be driven by exposure to a handful of very high-profile, but unrepresentative, candidates and campaigns. Third, because women view the activities involved in running for office much more negatively than do men, political and women's organizations would be well-served to work with female candidates to determine the best ways to minimize the personal trade-offs involved in seeking office. Training programs and technical assistance cannot be underestimated in closing the ambition gap. These resources can also go a long way in combating women's tendency to identify themselves as unqualified to run for office, despite equal or superior resumes and accomplishments when compared to men who opt to run. Fourth, the gendered division of labor we uncovered demonstrates that women and men who are similarly situated professionally are not similarly situated at home. Any move toward a more family-friendly work environment and campaign arena would likely confer disproportional benefits to women. Organizations and individuals dedicated to closing the gender gap in political ambition, therefore, must be cognizant of the persistence of traditional family dynamics. Finally, gender differences in interest in running for office are well in place by the time women and men begin their professional careers. The 2011 survey reveals that the gender gap in potential candidates' political ambition is just as glaring among 24 - 35 year olds as it is among older age cohorts. Gender differences in confidence, competitiveness, and ambition develop long before adulthood. A complete understanding of the interaction between gender and political ambition, therefore, demands that we focus on the origins of the gender gap. Conducting a national survey of high school and college students' attitudes toward seeking and holding elective office would go a long way in assessing the role of various socializing agents at critical moments in the development of early political identity. Only then can parents, educators, and civic organizations develop meaningful interventions that will mitigate the gender gap in political ambition. Concerns about democratic legitimacy and political accountability necessitate that we continue to examine and work to ameliorate gender disparities in office holding. The large gender gap in political ambition we identify, coupled with the stagnation in the number of women serving in elected offices in the last decade, makes the road ahead look quite daunting. Indeed, many barriers to women's interest in running for office can be overcome only with major cultural and political changes. But in the meantime, our results suggest that recruiting female candidates and disseminating information about the electoral environment and women's successes can help narrow the gender gap and increase women's numeric representation. The challenges in front of us are to continue to raise awareness about the barriers women face, and to continue to advocate for a more inclusive electoral process.18 | Lawless and Fox Appendix A: Research on the Difference Women Make in Politics Despite their low numbers, female elected officials make a difference in the issues they prioritize, the bills they sponsor and cosponsor, the output they generate, and the extent to which they mobilize their constituents. While by no means an exhaustive list, the following academic books and articles - noted along with the central finding from each - serve as an excellent starting point for individuals interested in gaining a more thorough grasp of the experiences and impact of women in U.S. politics.

In assembling the sample, we created two equal sized pools of candidates - one female and one male - that held the same professional credentials. Turning specifically to the four sub-samples, for lawyers and business leaders, we drew names from national directories. We obtained a random sample of 2,000 lawyers from the 2009 edition of the Martindale-Hubble Law Directory, which provides the names of practicing attorneys in all law firms across the country. We stratified the total number of lawyers by sex and in proportion to the total num-ber of law firms listed for each state. We randomly selected 3,000 business leaders from Dun and Bradstreet's Million Dollar Directory, 2009 - 2010, which lists the top executive officers of more than 160,000 U.S. public and private companies. Again, we stratified by geography and sex and ensured that men and women held comparable positions. 14 No national directories exist for our final two categories. To compile a sample of educators, we focused on college professors and administrative officials, and public school teachers and admin-istrators. We compiled a random sample of 800 public and private colleges and universities from the University of Texas's list of roughly 2,000 institutions that grant at least a four-year bachelor's degree. 15 We selected 400 male and 400 female professors and administrative officials. Because we did not stratify by school size, the college and university portion of the sample yielded a higher number of educators from smaller schools; however, we found that the size of the institution was not a significant predictor of political ambition. We then compiled a national sample of 600 male and 600 female public school teachers and principals. We obtained a list of all public schools throughout the country from the Department of Education's website, and then randomly selected the schools. We chose a specific teacher or principal at random from the school's webpage. A 2001 study by the U.S. Department of Education found that 98 percent of public schools had internet access and 84 percent had a webpage. While this study has not been updated, it is likely that closer to 100 percent of pub-lic schools now have a webpage. Our final eligibility pool profession - \"political activists and professionals\" - represents citizens who work in politics and public policy. We included in this sub-sample three types of potential candidates. First, we created a list of political interest groups and national organizations with state and/or local affiliates and sought to strike a partisan and ideological balance. We randomly selected state branch and local chapter executive directors and officers of organizations that focus on the environment, abortion, consumer issues, race relations, civil liberties, taxes, guns, crime, social security, school choice, government reform, and \"women's issues.\" This selection technique, which provided a range of activists from a broad cross-section of occupations, yielded 600 men and 600 women. Second, we compiled a random sample of 200 congressional chiefs of staff and legislative directors (100 women and 100 men), all of whom work in the representative or senator's Washington, DC, office. Third, we created a random sample of 300 female and 300 male local party leaders. We followed links from the national Democratic and Republican parties' websites to local chapters and offices, from where we selected six Democrats and six Republicans from each state. We employed standard mail survey protocol in conducting the study. Potential candidates received an initial letter explaining the study and a copy of the questionnaire. Three days later, they received a follow-up postcard. Two weeks later, we sent a follow-up letter with another copy of the questionnaire. We supplemented this third piece of correspondence with an email message when possible. Four months later, we sent another copy of the questionnaire. The final contact was made the following Men Rule The Continued Under-Representation of Women in U.S. Politics | 23 month, when we sent a link to an on-line version of the survey. Survey responses from nearly 3,800 members of the \"candidate eligibility pool\" serve as the basis for this report.16 Our sample of the \"eligibility pool,\" therefore, is a broad cross-section of equally credentialed and professionally similar women and men who are positioned to serve as future candidates for elective office. Table 10 reveals that the samples are roughly equal in terms of race, education, household income, and profession. Moreover, the women and men who completed the survey are well-matched in political engagement. We asked respondents whether - in the past two years - they had engaged in ten dif-ferent types of political participation, such as voting, contributing money to a candidate, or serving on the board of an organization. The mean number of acts of political participation (out of 10) for women was 5.6; the mean number of acts for men was 5.7. Women and men are also comparable in their interest in local and national politics, as well as their personal exposure and closeness to elected officials. Table 10 does, however, reveal two sta- tistically significant differences between women and men that merit discussion. Women in the sample, on average, are three years younger than men, a proba-ble result of the fact that women's entry into the fields of law and business is a relatively recent phenomenon. Further, women are more likely to be Democrats and liberal-leaning, while men are more likely to be Republicans and conserva-tive, a finding consistent with recent polls showing a partisan gender gap among the general U.S. population. Overall, our \"eligibility pool approach\" and sample allow us to offer a nuanced examination of the manner in which potential candidates make the initial decision to run for all levels and types of political office, both now and in the future.

Boulder: Westview Press). For other examples of scholarly research that arrives at the conclusion that women fare as well as their male counterparts on Election Day, see e.g., Fox, Richard L. 2010. \"Congressional Elections: Women's Candidacies and the Road to Gender Parity.\" In Gender and Elections, 2nd edition, eds.

Boulder: Lynne Reinner. 2 We acknowledge the conventional wisdom explaining women's slow ascension into electoral politics. Structural barriers, most notably the incumbency advantage and the proportion of women in the \"pipeline\" professions that precede political careers, limit the number of electoral opportunities for women and other previously excluded groups. There is no question that, as more open seats emerge, and as women continue to increase their proportions in the fields that tend to lead to office holding, there will be an increase in the number of female candidates. But by demonstrating that the process by which qualified individuals become actual candidates differs for women and men, we challenge the very precarious assumption that equally credentialed women and men are equally likely to emerge from the candidate eligibility pool, run for office, and win their races. 3 This was an endeavor to which virtually no research had been devoted. When we embarked upon this project and conducted the first wave of our study, there were two exceptions: The National Women's Political Caucus's poll of potential candidates (National Women's Political Caucus. 1994. Why Don't More Women Run? A study prepared by Mellman, Lazarus, and Lake, Washington, DC: National Women's Political Caucus); and a mail survey of potential candidates in New York state, which served as a pilot for our national study (Fox, Richard L., Jennifer L. Lawless and Courtney Feeley. 2001. \"Gender and the Decision to Run for Office.\" Legislative Studies Quarterly 26(3):411-35). 4 The results of the first wave of the study were widely disseminated. In addition to a series of academic journal articles and two policy reports, the results served as the basis of a book: Jennifer L. Lawless and Richard L. Fox. 2005.

In 2008, we resurveyed and interviewed the same respondents from 2001, only to find that, among the 2,036 women and men who completed the 2008 questionnaire, aggregate levels of interest in running for office remained the same. The 2008 follow-up study yielded two books: Jennifer L. Lawless. 2012. Becoming a Candidate: Political Ambition and the Decision to Run for Office. New York: Cambridge University Press; and Jennifer L. Lawless and Richard L. Fox. 2010. It Still Takes A Candidate: Why Women Don't Run for Office. New York: Cambridge University Press. Men Rule The Continued Under-Representation of Women in U.S. Politics | 25 5 Women are not only less likely than men to consider running for office; they are also less likely actually to do it. Overall, 12 percent of the respondents had run for some elective position. Men, however, were 40 percent more likely than women to have done so (9 percent of women, compared to 14 percent of men; difference significant at p < .05). Although there was no statistically significant gender difference in election outcomes, women were less likely than men to reach this seemingly gender neutral \"end-stage\" of the electoral process. 6 All of the comparisons we present here and throughout the remainder of the report are based on the overall sample of potential candidates. When we break the data down into professional sub-samples (i.e., lawyers, business leaders, educators, political activists), in almost all cases, the magnitude of the gender gaps and levels of statistical significance remain unchanged. 7 \"Transcript: Hillary Clinton Endorses Barack Obama,\" New York Times, June 7, 2008.

For instance, 74 percent of Democrats, compared to only 49 percent of Republicans and independents, believe Hillary Clinton received sexist media coverage and treatment (difference significant at p < .05). On the other end of the spectrum, whereas 76 percent of Republicans identified sexist media treatment directed at Sarah Palin, 64 percent of Democrats did so (difference significant at p < .05). Across the board, though, women of both political parties were more likely than men to identify media and voter bias against these female candidates, and sizeable portions of women crossed party lines to express perceptions of sexism. 10 In 2001, we did not uncover these gender differences in attitudes toward campaigning. We reported no gender differences in attitudes about attending fundraisers or dealing with party officials. The three significant differences we did find regarding attitudes toward campaigning revealed that women were actually more positive than men about dealing with the press, meeting constituents, and enduring the time consuming nature of a campaign. The different results likely reflect question wording differences, as opposed to changes in attitudes. Asking whether a respondent feels \"positively\" about a campaign activity, which is how we asked the question in 2001, seems to have obscured the intensity behind attitudes. Women in the candidate eligibility pool remain just as likely as men to state that the rigors of a campaign would not bother them - i.e., that they feel positively about engaging in them. But our new, more detailed investigation reveals that the women who do not embrace campaign activities hold much more intense negative views than do their male counterparts. 11 The White House Project, for example, is a national, non-partisan organization that, since 1998, has advanced women's leadership and attempted to fill the candidate pipeline. In 2007, the Women's Campaign Forum launched its \"She Should Run\" campaign, a non-partisan, online effort to build the pipeline of Democratic and Republican pro-choice women and inject them into the networks that can promote eventual candidacies. Emerge America, founded in 2002, trains Democratic women across the country to develop networks of supporters so that they can successfully run for and win elective office. The 26 | Lawless and Fox EMILY's List Political Opportunity Program, which began in 2001, trains and supports pro- choice Democratic women to run for all levels of office. Many statewide and local women's organizations have also recently launched aggressive campaigns to bring more women into political circles and positions of power. 12 We thank Georgia Duerst-Lahti for this comment. 13 Josh Kraushaar, \"Democrats Bet the Senate on Women,\" National Journal Daily, November 30, 2011.

Not only do members of the business community change positions and companies more frequently than do attorneys or educators, but the directory from which we compiled the sample also lists only the addresses of the corporate headquarters; in many cases, this was not the address at which our intended respondent worked. 15 See http://www.utexas.edu/world/univ/state/ (March 20, 2011). 16 From the original sample of 9,000, 1,661 surveys were undeliverable. From the remaining members of the sample, we received 3,953 responses. After taking into account respondents who left the majority of the questionnaire incomplete, we were left with 3,768 completed surveys, for a usable response rate of 51 percent. Response rates within the four sub-samples were: lawyers - 54%; business leaders - 38%; educators - 56%; political activists - 58%, and did not differ by sex.About the Authors Jennifer L.
