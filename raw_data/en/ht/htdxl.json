About one-quarter of Americans will serve as caregivers to a beloved family member or friend. Family caregivers quickly become experts at this demanding job but often feel like they have to \"re-invent the wheel\" in figuring out and prioritizing the many tasks involved. This handbook has been developed to pr ovide easily accessible and accurate information to family caregivers helping to assist and/or car e for loved ones with brain tumors. Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 1 / PAGE 1.1 Handbook Overview While much of this handbook provides general information, it has been prepared specifically for family caregivers of patients in the Neurosurgery and Neurological Oncology practices at the University of California, San Francisco. All the contents presented here have been carefully reviewed by Dr. Mitchel Berger, the Chairman of the Department of Neurological Surgery at UCSF and an international expert in the treatment of brain tumors. In addition, this information has been developed and reviewed in consultation with Celi Adams, RN, who founded Home Care Companions and Caregiving 101, nationally recognized family caregiver support organizations. Much of the content has been adapted from resources currently available on the Internet and from family caregiving organizations. At the back of the book we have noted the source of all borrowed material and appreciate the permissions we have received to present it here. The handbook covers the full range of issues faced by family caregivers, including managing physical symptoms, caring for your loved one at home and in medical facilities, communicating with healthcare providers, managing emotional distress, supporting the caregiver, and handling financial and legal issues. The handbook is organized into eight chapters with multiple resources and appendices at the end. CHAPTER 1 provides an overview of the handbook. CHAPTER 2 focuses on routine family caregiving at home, including tips to help you manage medications and medical recordsand coordinate a care team. CHAPTER 3 outlines common brain cancer symptoms, tr eatment side effects and offers direction about whom to call for help and when. CHAPTER 4 talks about the critical role of family caregivers at the doctor's officeand in the hospital and gives you helpfulcommunication advice when speaking withyour medical team. CHAPTER 5 provides helpful tips for communicating with your family. CHAPTER 6 reviews the different types of health insurance, entitlements, and assistancethat may be available to help you pay forhealth care and discusses how you can be aneffective advocate for your loved one. CHAPTER 7 advises you on important plans you should make to secure quality end-of-lifemedical car e, and estate planning. CHAPTER 8 suggests strategies to maintain your own well-being and to give you a senseof control, hope, and balance. THE APPENDIX include a series of resources and more detailed information that you canturn to. Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 1 / PAGE 1.2Importance of Family Caregiving Caring for loved ones with brain tumors means that you are dealing with medical issues at the same time that you also are serving as a source of important emotional support for the person facing cancer. As a family caregiver, you are called upon to perform a large variety of tasks to provide care for your loved one. For example, family caregivers: Organize and administer medications Communicate with physicians, nurses, and social workers Provide transportation Take care of home chores including cooking and cleaning Help with dressing changes Assist with physical therapy and occupational therapy exer cises Research and negotiate medical insurance benefits and submit claims Attend to business, legal, and financial matters Monitor medication side effects For most family caregivers, responsibilities at work and home do not stop when a loved one gets ill. Y our own personal needs for rest and attention to your own health do not go away either. This means that you may find yourself juggling multiple responsibilities, some of which may conflict. Caring for a loved one who is ill often creates a deepened sense of closeness and connection between the two of you. Y ou may experience increased intimacy, satisfaction, and pride. However, the anxiety that comes with dealing with a serious illness, combined with the burden of car egiving, can create strain in the relationship and stress for you. At some points you may feel overwhelmed, guilty, resentful, angry, anxious, and even depressed 1. These varied and complex emotions are common. It is normal to feel both positive and negative emotions when providing care for a loved one who is ill. Sometimes circumstances thrust people into the r ole of caring for someone, often a relative, with whom they may have a strained relationship. This situation can intensify the usual negative emotions caregivers feel, especially guilt and resentment. Under these circumstances it is important to seek help both for the actual hands-on care and for emotional support. While no amount of information can eliminate the physical work and emotional challenges of caring for a loved one who is ill, the helpful hints pr esented in this handbook are designed to ease the frustration and sense of isolation you may feel while doing what can sometimes seem like an impossible job. The handbook provides tips on which situations call for professional help, so you will have a better sense of what you can expect, when to call the doctor, and what you can do at home to help. You are an instrumental part of your loved one's health care team. Our deepest respect goes to you for the assistance you graciously and lovingly offer. 1 Gauthier A, Vignola A, Calvo L, Mutani R, Chio A: A longitudinal study on quality of life and depression in ALS patient-caregiver couples.

Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 1 / PAGE 1.3Chapter 2 Managing Care at HomeIn this chapter: Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 2 / PAGE 2.1 Identifying Tasks Accomplishing Car egiving Jobs Tips for Finding Home Car e Services Getting Organized Managing Medications Tracking Treatments and Side Ef fects Becoming the primary caregiver for a loved one can be a real challenge. You must learn to balance work, family, and your own needs, while caring for someone else and fulfilling some of the responsibilities he or she used to have. Caregiving requires skills that you may not be familiar with and demands the ability to manage your loved one's care almost as if it were a complex business project. This chapter provides an overview of the different tasks involved in caregiving at home and features an important discussion about organizing medical records, tracking treatments, and managing medications \u2014 some of the most critical jobs of a caregiver. Finally, it offers some guidance about how to prioritize your caregiving responsibilities, and offers tools to organize supportive family members and friends who may be able to help. Identifying Critical Tasks Some caregiving tasks are simple and basic, involving household chores and maintenance, while others are more private and involve hands-on patient care. Talk to your loved one about the tasks that need to be accomplished and involve him or her in doing tasks whenever possible. Also, consider how much work it will take to accomplish each task\u2014is it a one-time task or an ongoing need? 1 Identify tasks that are routine and tasks that involve hands-on patient care 2 Make a list of what tasks need to be accomplished and maintained 3 Estimate the hours per day, week, or month that tasks will require You may need to become familiar with tasks that are new for you, but are common for home care. We've organized them in the chart at right.Routine Tasks Food Preparation Plan, prepare, and serve meals Buy groceries Clean kitchen Managerial Tasks Manage finances, banking, and bills Apply for social services and financial assistance Manage insurance Attend to legal matters (examples: Advance Health Directives, Powers of Attorney) Manage medical appointments Transportation Drive/assist with transportation to appointments and recreation Get disabled parking placard from DMV Run errands Assuming a Loved One's Prior Responsibilities Care for pets, children, and elderly/other family members Housework Laundry Garbage removal House and yard maintenance Tasks Involving Hands-on Patient Care In-home Supervision Providing companionship Providing safety and comfort at home Personal Hygiene Bathing Oral hygiene Skin and hair care Medical/Nursing Care Managing and administering medications Lifting and transferring in and out of beds and chairs Recreation Recreation and respite activities with family Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 2 / PAGE 2.2Accomplishing Caregiving Jobs As your loved one's illness changes or progresses, responsibilities for care may change as well. You may find that you can only take on a limited number of responsibilities while you balance your life. As a primary caregiver, you may have the option of caring for your loved one yourself, coordinating a team of volunteer caregivers to help you, or hiring outside help from various organizations. 1DOING THE JOB YOURSELF If you will be doing the actual caregiving work, use these tips to help adjust to the role: Prioritize your time and responsibilities. Schedule your priorities. Determine which tasks in your life ar e urgent, which are important, which are both, and which are neither. This allows you to focus only on the necessary tasks to maintain your home and life. IMPORTANT NOT IMPORTANTNOT URGENT URGENTConsider Do Don't do Schedule Explore your benefits. Your employer may pr ovide you with paid or unpaid medical leave for family caregiving. Discuss your benefits with your supervisor or human resources representative. If your loved one qualifies as low income, you may be eligible to receive financial assistance for care, or your loved one may be able to receive attendant care through in-home support services. Learn caregiving skills. There are many or ganizations that offer one-day workshops and evening classes to teach caregiving skills. Find options by looking online or contacting local social service agencies that provide assistance to people with brain tumors, cancer or other disabilities. Consult a social worker or use the Yellow Pages to find help. Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 2 / PAGE 2.3Adapted from First Things First, (1994) Covey, Merrill & Merrill12GETTING HELP FROM FRIENDS AND FAMILY Bring family members and friends together and request their help in caregiving. This may not be easy for you. You might find it difficult to ask for help because it feels like an admission that you can't handle what you need to do or because you feel you are imposing on others. Even if people do offer help, it can be difficult to accept. It is important to get beyond these barriers because ther e are times when you simply can't and shouldn't do it all yourself. It may help to realize that most family members and friends appreciate having the opportunity to be helpful. At the same time, it is important to be sensitive to signs that volunteers ar e wearing out, in which case new ones need to be found. Sometimes, the \"retiring\" volunteers can help replace themselves. Creating a Care Team will add support for your loved one and for you. If you choose to cr eate a team of volunteer caregivers, it is critical to ask your loved one which people he or she would like involved, as they may have very personal interactions. The following is a list of ways to identify potential helpers.Identifying Your Caregiving Team Ask your loved one and other family members who would be appr opriate helpers. Explore your loved one's or your family's phone book or Rolodex for social contacts. Contact your loved one's or your family's social organizations such as r eligious organizations, workplace, and social groups/clubs. Find professional home-care organizations through the Inter net, local newspapers, and the phonebook. Consider people's skills, abilities to manage time and pr ojects, and strengths and weaknesses. Once you have put together a care team, you'll need to coor dinate the members so that everyone's efforts are used most effectively. Here are some suggestions. Coordinate the Care You or a family member (not your loved one) should call to invite the person to help. Hold an introductory one-hour meeting for all team members to discuss the specifics: issues regarding the illness and patient's needs what the current needs are of the patient and family the roles or tasks each member can take contact information team members' schedules, availabilities, tasks they're willing to do delegation of a \"team leader\" to make phone calls to team members during emer gencies, when there is a change in plans, or to re-organize schedules set up a system for quarterly or other check-in on volunteer availability: \"Do you need a br eak?\" You may find it helpful to keep your family, friends, and care team connected by creating a personalized web page at sites like www.caringbridge.org or abta.lotsahelpinghands.com. These are personal and fr ee web pages that anyone can register for. Creating a care page is easy and offers you the ability to share photos, receive emotional support, and have a virtual meeting place. Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 2 / PAGE 2.4 Manage members' schedules on a master calendar that remains at the patient's home. Have an easily visible list of important information at the patient's house, including location of pharmacies, grocery stores, medical information, and doctor's contact information. Have petty cash available for helpers in case of emergencies and an extra set of house keys. Declining Help Sometimes people offer you help you don't need. Thank them for their concern. Tell them that you will let them know if you need anything. Sometimes people offer unwanted advice. They may do this because they don't know what else to say. It is up to you to decide how to deal with this. You do not have to respond to them at all. Otherwise, thank them and let it go. You might tell them that you are taking steps to help your family. 23PAYING FOR HELP If you can afford it, you may want to hire someone to come to your home to help with health and home care. There are many professional agencies that offer home health aide services. You can choose home care providers with qualifications based on your needs. Service providers range from certified nurses, to informal companions, to house cleaners. Below are some suggestions for finding qualified professional help. Tips for Finding Home Care Services You can choose to advertise, interview, and hire in-home help privately or you can go through an agency. If you choose to hire privately, the advantage is that you can usually pay less per hour for help. However, this means you are an employer and must adhere to all employment laws including paying payroll taxes and carrying Workers' Comp insurance. The state Employment Development Department will help you set up the necessary paperwork. The disadvantages are: There is no back-up if the attendant is sick or doesn't show up. The attendants are usually not bonded. You must conduct the interviews and do background checks. If you use an agency, you will pay more per hour, but they assume the employment responsibilities, bond and certify the attendants, and provide substitutes for sick days. To find an agency: Request referrals for services from your doctor or social worker. Search on the Internet or in the phone book for local care providers. Ask friends and acquaintances in all areas of your social circle for recommendations. SEE THE APPENDIX for more information on homecare and team coordination. Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 2 / PAGE 2.5Getting Organized When it comes to managing your loved one's health care, the more organized you are, the better. You'll be more prepared and have more control when it comes to making decisions, preventing medical errors, and having access to accurate information. A great way to become organized is by keeping a health care binder. Many caregivers say that these simple books kept them focused, organized, and feeling in control particularly during emergency situations. To create a binder, go to an office supply or drug store and purchase: A large three-ring binder in which to keep all information Two or three packages of dividers with tabs so you can divide your binder into separate sections Two or three storage pouches (8 \u00bd x 11) that are three-hole punched, one with slots for business cards. One will hold CD-ROMs of your scans, while the one with card slots will hold business cards of your medical specialists, care providers, pharmacy, etc. Lined notepads that are three-hole punched so you can take notes on the paper and insert the sheets in the appropriate sections A three-hole puncherHere are some suggestions for organizing your sections, made by Dr. Paul Zeltzer in his book Brain Tumors: Leaving the Garden of Eden 3: Pathology reports, MRI, and CT scans \u2014 These reports contain the most critical information about the tumor and diagnosis, and will direct the treatment options. Ask your doctor for a copy of scans on a CD-ROM or film, so you can bring them with you if you get second opinions or seek new treatment. Lab reports and blood tests \u2014 Having copies of these on hand will allow you to quickly refer to them without having to ask the nurses or doctors to search for them. Notes and questions section \u2014 This is where you can write notes while at appointments, or keep a file of questions you need answered by the doctors. Medication log \u2014 See the Appendix for a blank medication log on which you can fill in the medications being taken, dosages, dates, side effects, problems, and who prescribed them. Treatment log \u2014 See the Appendix for this form on which you can fill in the treatments your loved one has received such as radiation, surgeries, or chemotherapy \u2014 including the dates, side effects, problems, and doctor's information. Resources and information \u2014 This is where you can file the information/forms you've received or signed at appointments. Calendar pages \u2014 See the Appendix for a blank calendar template that you can copy and fill in with dates \u2014 include medical and treatment appointments, home-care, and therapy schedules. Health History \u2014 See the Appendix for this form, on which you can record important health information such as the patient's insurance policy number, emergency contact information, a history of other serious illness, allergic reaction to medications, or another condition that he or she is currently being treated for. SEE THE APPENDIX for a blank medication log, treatment log, calendar template, and health history form. Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 2 / PAGE 2.6Managing Medications Living with a serious illness usually means taking multiple medications to treat the illness and side effects of treatments. Many patients take herbal therapies, vitamins, and supplements as part of their medical regimen. No matter what type of pills your loved one is taking, it is important to keep track of what is being taken and when. The majority of medical errors in this country are related to mistakes in medication usage. 4 Mistakes in the type of medication taken, the wrong dosage, or an interaction between drugs can lead to severe health consequences or worse yet, death. The best way to prevent this is to keep track of your loved one's medication regimen in an organized way. Here are important tips for managing medications and preventing errors: 1 When you get the prescription from the doctor, make sure you can read the drug name and dosage clearly. If you can't, ask the doctor to print it out clearly (this will guarantee the pharmacist has the correct information). 2 Ask the doctor what it is for, what it does, and what to do if there are side effects. 3 Make sure the doctor is aware of all the other medications, including supplements and herbal products, that are being taken in case there are possible interactions. 4 Maintain an up-to-date medication log with all prescription and non-prescription items (including over-the-counter medications like antacids, supplements like vitamins, protein powders, herbs, or other \"holistic\" treatments). 5 On your log, include the name of the medication, dosages, medication schedule, the doctor who prescribed the drug, what it is for, and any side effects experienced. 6 When picking up the prescription, make sure the order has your loved one's name on it and includes the correct pills at the right dosage. 7 Consider purchasing a pill box to organize the medications by day of the week and time of day 8 Supervise your loved one's managing of and taking of medications until you are sure that they can correctly follow the medication regimen on their own. Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 2 / PAGE 2.7Tracking Treatments and Side Effects Once your loved one returns home after having treatments like surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy, symptoms or side effects of the treatments may occur. Some of these issues may be resolved by speaking on the phone with a nurse, and some may require follow up visits with the doctor. It is helpful to keep track of the treatments that were given and the symptoms or side effects that occurred in the treatment log. If your loved one is experiencing pain at any point, you may want to use the common pain scale included in the Appendix to rate the severity and make note of when it happened so that the doctor can identify the cause and possibly change treatments or follow up with a different procedure. Between physician visits, record the following types of information in your treatment log5: Medical treatments, procedures, and tests with corresponding dates Side effects of treatments with the time and date of occurrence Frequency of any seizures, brief descriptions, dates of occurrence Pain rating scale from 0-5 Results of tests taken: blood pressure, blood sugar levels, seizure medication blood level, etc. Any symptoms out of the ordinary: pain, fevers and night sweats, nausea, lack of appetite, insomnia, fatigue, confusion, or anxiety SEE THE APPENDIX for a treatment log and pain rating scale. 1 Covey S, Merrill A, Merrill R.

Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 2 / PAGE 2.8Chapter 3 Symptoms Associated with Brain Tumors and Side Effects of TreatmentIn this chapter: What To Do About Common Symptoms Identifying and Treating Psychological Symptoms Tumor Location and Symptoms Common Side Effects of Tr eatment Unfortunately, it is quite common for brain tumor patients to experience symptoms associated with their tumor, as well as side effects of the treatment. Symptoms and side effects may be the result of the type of tumor, the location and/or size of the tumor, and the type of treatments utilized (see Symptoms Based on Tumor Location, page 3.7). Surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and drug therapies may all affect the regions of the brain they are directed to as well as alter neurological functions such as the release of hormones and chemicals in the brain. The symptoms your loved one experiences may change over time. They may include both physical and psychological changes. This chapter will briefly describe the most common symptoms in people being treated for a brain tumor, and will suggest what to do if the symptoms occur. Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 3 / PAGE 3.1 Common Brain Tumor Symptoms The most common symptoms experienced by patients with brain tumors are headaches and seizures. Both may be managed with medication. Loss of sensation and muscle strength may be managed and adapted to with use of occupational and physical therapies. A blood clot or deep vein thrombosis is best managed by preventive measures and early aggressive intervention if those measures fail. Hearing and vision changes may occur throughout treatment and may be treated with specialized interventions. Psychological symptoms such as fatigue, behavioral, and cognitive changes may be treated with cognitive therapy, psychotherapy, and medication 1 (see Psychological Symptoms of Brain Tumors, page 3.6). Although you should discuss all new symptoms your loved one experiences with your physician or nurse, the table on the following page, \"What To Do About Common Brain Tumor Symptoms,\" offers some common advice about what to do and whom to call if these symptoms develop. One symptom that deserves special attention is depression. Current research shows that symptoms associated with depression are common with brain tumors as well as after surgery to remove the tumor, and may increase over time 2. Symptoms may include prolonged feelings of sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in things, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, insomnia, decreased energy, and even thoughts of suicide. Untreated depression can slow rates of recovery from treatments and cause other health problems. Depression affects not only the patient's quality of life, but also that of the caregiver. It is important to familiarize yourself with the signs and symptoms associated with depression. Your loved one's medical team will likely be focused on the treatment of the brain tumor. You may be the first to identify this important symptom. You can alert the doctor to your concerns. The doctor can perform professional formal screening and diagnosis of depression and offer effective treatments such as medication and/or psychotherapy. Common symptoms experienced by patients with brain tumors include1: Headache Seizures Sensory (touch) and motor (movement) loss Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT or blood clot) Hearing loss Vision loss Fatigue Depression Behavioral and cognitive (thinking) changes Endocrine dysfunction (hormone/gland changes) Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 3 / PAGE 3.2What To Do If Symptoms Occur The following chart is to help family caregivers understand some common symptoms that their loved one may experience. This chart provides only a rough guide and does not take the place of an in-person assessment by a physician. If there is any question about the seriousness of a symptom, please contact your loved one's physician or get your loved one to an emergency room immediately.

It is extremely complex, and is made up of many different structures that control specific functions. The symptoms your loved one experiences will depend on the type of tumor, and where it is located in the brain. Here is a list of the major parts of the brain, and some possible symptoms or functional loss that may result from a tumor in that region. Frontal Lobe Weakness Paralysis on one side of body Mood disturbances Difficulty thinking Confusion Disorientation Mood swings Organization and Planning Seizures Memory Judgement Parietal Lobe Seizures Paralysis Problems with handwriting Mathematical difficulty Motor/Cognitive skill deficits Loss of sense of touchOccipital Lobe Loss of vision Visual hallucinations Seizures Temporal Lobe Seizures Perceptual/spatial disturbances Inability to understand multi-step commands (receptive aphasia) Lack of insight Memory Cerebellum Loss of balance (ataxia) Loss of coordination Headaches Vomiting Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 3 / PAGE 3.7Common Side Effects of Treatment Specific drugs and treatments have specific and unique side effects that should be discussed with your doctor. Some of the side effects associated with standard treatments for newly diagnosed brain tumors are listed below. This is not a complete list of possible side effects. Every patient reacts individually to treatment, and your loved one could experience many or very few of these effects. Most patients do not experience all the side effects listed. There is no correlation between the severity of side effects and the effectiveness of the medication or therapy. Most of these side effects are reversible and will go away when treatment is complete. There are many options to help minimize side ef fects, which should be discussed with your treating physician. To help your doctors recognize possible drug interactions, keep a list of all medications, including over -the-counter products. INTERVENTION POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS WHAT TO DO Surgery: Surgical removal is usually the most effective first-line treatment against brain tumors. Surgeons usually aim to remove as much of the visible tumor as possible. Headache Infection at incision site (redness, swelling, discharge, fever) Problems speaking or thinking clearly Muscle weaknessContact your neurosurgeon if these problems appear following surgery. Radiation Therapy Short term effects: Fatigue Hair loss Scalp irritation Muffled hearing Short-term memory loss Long-term effects: Memory loss Radiation necrosis (a build up of dead brain tissue) Neurological impairments (these may vary depending on what part of the brain is most irradiated and how that part normally functions)Report your symptoms to the doctor caring for you at the time that the symptoms occur. This may be the radiation oncologist, the medical oncologist, the neurologist or your primary care physician. Chemotherapy \u2014 T emodar (Temozolomide) and Gleostine (CCNU): These are oral alkylating agents that are commonly prescribed to patients with newly diagnosed brain tumors. Vomiting Nausea Fatigue Loss of appetite Headache Constipation Lowered blood countsContact your oncologist or chemo nurse. They can suggest strategies or other medications that may alleviate the side effects. Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 3 / PAGE 3.8INTERVENTION POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS WHAT TO DO Optune is an FDA-approved medical device that, when turned on, creates low-intensity wave-like electric fields called tumor treating fields (TTF). Using four adhesive patches called transducer arrays, TTFs are delivered to the location of a GBM and interfere with cell division. This action slows or stops glioblastoma cells from dividing and may destroy them.The most common side effects when using Optune alone ar e: Scalp irritation (redness and itchiness) Headache Other side effects may be: Malaise Muscle twitching Skin ulcersFollow instructions for skin preparation with array changes, Evaluate skin condition for redness or open areas with each array change. Contact prescribing doctor or nurse team when skin changes are observed. Anti-Inflammatory / Brain Swelling \u2014 Monoclonal Antibody: Avastin (Bevacizumab, MVASI) is a monoclonal antibody that is an injectable cancer medication that works by blocking a pr otein (VEGF) that is important for the formation of blood vessels. Since tumors rely on blood vessels to get the nutrients they need to survive, the drug is thought to work by preventing the formation of new blood vessels that feed the tumor. In addition to being used as an anti-tumor agent, Avastin can also be used to treat inflammation and swelling in the brain. Hoarse voice Bloody nose, Increase in blood pressure Increased risk of bleeding Impaired wound healingContact your doctor's office if you notice increased bruising and/or bleeding, blood in urine, gums, or elsewhere. Immunotherapy: Keytruda (pembr olizumab) is a type of immunotherapy that has been approved by the FDA for treatment of certain recurrent glioblastomas. Pembrolizumab is in a category of drugs called immune checkpoint inhibitors which bind with the immune checkpoint or the surrounding tumor proteins and prevent the tumor cells from turning off the immune system. These drugs allow the immune system to work as it was designed, specifically , T-cells (immune cells) are able to recognize and attack the tumor cells. www.keytruda.comThe most common side effects that ar e reported by patients include rash or itchy skin, gastrointestinal disturbances, muscle and/or joint pain, cough, fatigue, and lab abnormalities. Pembrolizumab has the potential to cause a long list of side ef fects, most mild to moderate, but on occasion they can be severe. For many the side effects improve with time and are tolerable. If you have symptoms that are severe or persist you should always notify your treating MD. Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 3 / PAGE 3.9 Steroids: These may be prescribed before or after surgery and help to reduce inflammation and swelling in the brain. Common steroids include dexamethasone (brand name Decadron), prednisone, and methylprednisolone. Blurred vision Headache Mood and personality changes Swelling of the fingers, hands, feet, or lower legs Increased appetite Weight gain Muscle weakness Trouble sleeping High blood sugar Increased chance of infection Steroid myopathyPatients should never stop taking ster oids without talking to their oncologist or a nurse first. Anti-epileptic Drugs (AEDs): These are pr escribed to control seizures. Some common AEDs are Levetiracetam (brand name Keppra), Phenytoin (brand name Neurontin) and Topiramate (brand name Topomax). Fatigue Nausea Weakness Problems with balance and coordination Dizziness Drowsiness Mood and behavior changesIf possible report your symptoms to the doctor who pr escribed the medication for you. If that doctor is not available, report the symptoms to the doctor caring for you at the time that the symptoms occur. Rash, hives, difficulty br eathing or swelling of the lips, tongue and jaw may indicate an allergic reaction and you should seek emergency care immediately. 1FDA.gov 2 Stewart-Amidei, C.

As a family caregiver, your critical role isn't limited to the home. You are also an important part of your loved one's care when he or she is visiting the doctor in clinic or is receiving care in the hospital. This chapter will review the roles of certain staff and doctors, explain what goes on in the hospital and clinic, and provide helpful tools to giving care in these settings. Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 4 / PAGE 4.1 A Multidisciplinary Medical Team UCSF's Moffitt-Long Hospital is part of a university that trains health care professionals, includes many ongoing research activities, and hosts health students for their clinical training. It is a full-service hospital with many more layers of services than a community hospital. Here patients are cared for by medical students, interns, residents, fellows, and nursing students, under the direction of a primary doctor. At UCSF , attending physicians generally have continuity of care with patients, meaning they treat the same patient in both the hospital and clinic. However, a resident physician who works in the hospital may not see a patient again after hospitalization. Direct physician communication, inpatient (hospital) notes, and outpatient (clinic) notes are stored in your electronic medical record (EMR). Your medical record serves as communication links between the two services. Be informed about your loved one's medical history, current treatment plan, and most important, medications, so you can correct inaccuracies if they arise. Patients have the right to view and have copies of the information in their medical record. Contact Medical Records at 415-353-2221 or visit https://www. ucsfhealth.org/billing-and-insurance/medical-records to request copies of medical records.The Hospital Team Once admitted into the hospital, your loved one will be cared for by a team of health care professionals. The following is a list of hospital staff members: Physicians are responsible for managing your loved one's care. If necessary, the doctor may consult other specialists. Your loved one may be seen by a team of doctors, including fellows, residents, interns, and medical students who work with the attending physician. Attending physicians are leaders of the team that determine and supervise your loved one's medical care. Attending physicians also teach other doctors to care for patients. Your loved one will be assigned an attending physician. They change periodically, so please ask the nurse or doctor about the scheduled rotation of doctors on your unit. Fellows are physicians who have completed their residency training and are now receiving advanced training in a specialty. Fellows work with an attending physician and help teach interns and residents under the guidance of attending physicians. Residents and interns are physicians completing their training. Interns are in the first year of training after graduating from medical school. They work under the guidance of attending physicians and fellows. Medical students are third and fourth year students of the School of Medicine who are conducting their clinical rounds prior to their graduation and residency. Nurse practitioners are registered nurses with advanced education in special areas. The nurse practitioners work closely with the attending physician to oversee and direct your care. These nurses have training and skills in assessment, physical diagnosis, and management of health needs in their specialty areas. Clinical nurses are the registered nurses who provide the round the clock care that your loved one needs while in the hospital. They provide routine health assessments, monitor symptoms, administer medications, ensure that doctor's orders are followed, assist with personal care, provide emotional support, and communicate with families and the medical team about a patient's needs and care. Patient care assistants are trained to help nurses care for patients. They work under the supervision of a nurse and provide routine care activities but do not give medications. Patient support assistants help units stay clean and equipped. Unit coordinators help units stay clean and equipped. Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 4 / PAGE 4.2Specialists Medical care becomes complex when a person receives a complicated diagnosis like a brain tumor. In addition to the hospital team common at a university medical center, a team of specialists for inpatient and outpatient care is needed to address all of the patient's needs. When putting together a medical team that will be a good fit for you and your loved one, it may help to consider whether you are comfortable asking the doctor important questions, and whether the doctor gives you the time you need and seems respectful of your loved one's health care needs. In some cases it may be helpful to get a second or third opinion. Many specialists will support your desire to get other doctors' opinions to ensure that you are comfortable with the treatment options you ultimately choose. Brain tumor organizations like the National Brain Tumor Society can help you choose treatment centers and coordinate members of your medical team 1. If you have not dealt with health complications in the past, you may quickly need to figure out how to coordinate communication with a team of specialists as well as your loved one's other caregivers. You will also need to become skilled at managing medical records that are generated by the various specialists. The following list includes many specialists who might be involved in comprehensive care for your loved one. Chaplain \u2014 This is trained professional, often a member of the clergy, who has been trained to help support patients in the hospital who are facing serious illness both emotionally and spiritually. Child-Life Specialist \u2014 This is a therapist trained to support children facing serious illness themselves or in their family.Endocrinologist \u2014 This specialist treats disorders of the endocrine system, a complex system of organs that secrete and respond to hormones (chemicals which regulate much of our body's functions). Some brain tumor patients may need care from an endocrinologist because they have had surgery or radiation that caused damage to one of the endocrine organs \u2014 the pituitary gland located in the brain. Neuro-Oncologist \u2014 This specialist has primary training in either oncology (cancer), neurology (nervous system), or neurosurgery, and has additional training specifically for diagnosing and treating cancers of the nervous system. You will likely see the neuro-oncologist at the clinic or office for follow-up visits, and contact this doctor when experiencing side effects of treatment (such as surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and medication). Neuropathologist \u2014 This doctor analyzes the tumor tissue removed by your neurosurgeon, and sends your team a pathology report that identifies the tumor type and guides your treatment options. Obtain a copy of this report for your medical files so you can refer to it when conducting research, or seeking treatment or a second opinion. You will probably not work directly with the neuropathologist. Neuropsychologist \u2014 This type of psychologist specializes in understanding how the structures of the brain relate to cognition (thinking, reason-ing, remembering, imagining, learning words, and using language), emotion, and behavior. Neuropsychologists are trained to assess the cognitive strengths and weaknesses of people who have had illness or an injury to the brain, and offer strategies to improve brain functions for a better quality of life. This psychologist will work with the medical team and the rehabilitation therapists (occupational and speech therapists). Neuroradiologist \u2014 This radiologist specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the nervous system (brain, spinal cord, neck) by using radiation technologies. Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 4 / PAGE 4.3Neurosurgeon \u2014 This surgeon treats many disorders of the nervous system, and also deals with nonsurgical issues such as prevention, diagnosis, evaluation, treatment, critical care, and rehabilitation. You are most likely to meet the neurosurgeon during emergency care, or before and after surgery in the hospital. If you are seeking out a neurosurgeon, look for one who specializes in treating the type of tumor your loved one has. Primary care physician \u2014 This is the local internal medicine or family doctor whom your loved one sees for common health problems when they first arise. This doctor often refers patients to specialists for more complicated or specific problems. (Most insurance companies require you to get a referral from your primary care physician to see specialists). Although this doctor may not be an expert in brain tumor treatment, he or she is familiar with your loved one and can help coordinate the care received from all the specialists. This physician can be seen for urgent care if the specialist is not accessible or to help treat the side effects associated with the brain tumor treatment. Psychologist \u2014 This mental health professional helps patients identify sources of emotional unrest and offers strategies and counseling to promote mental wellbeing and enhanced quality of life. It is not uncommon for patients with brain tumors to experience depression due to structural changes in the brain, side effects of medication, and life changes they are adjusting to. Psychologists can help patients and caregivers cope with important issues and life changes that may be overlooked by the doctors who provide technical medical care. Psychiatrist \u2014 This is a physician who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health disturbances, some of which may result from tumor treatments like surgery or radiation. Psychiatrists are an important part of the medical team because they can prescribe and adjust medication dosages and may also provide counseling to help manage these symptoms. Radiologist \u2014 This doctor specializes in diagnosing and treating diseases with medical imaging technologies such as MRI, CT, PET, and ultrasound. Some radiologists specialize in treating particular diseases like brain tumors, and some doctors who specialize in treating specific illnesses may be trained in using radiation therapy. Radiation oncologist \u2014 This oncologist is trained to treat cancer patients with radiation therapy. Once the patient completes the course of radiation therapy this doctor will not likely be a part of your loved one's active medical team. Because radiation is known to have short- and long-term after-effects, this doctor may continue to follow up if problems arise. Social worker \u2014 These are licensed professionals employed by a hospital, treatment center, non-profit organization, and/or through private organizations. They are available to assess patient and caregiver needs (medical, financial, and emotional); develop a plan of care; and help obtain the services needed. You should schedule a meeting with the social worker upon admission to your treatment center or seek support from a social worker at a brain tumor or cancer organization. Palliative care specialists \u2014 This health care team works with the primary treating team in providing relief from the pain symptoms, side effects, and emotional difficulties associated with having a brain tumor. Some members of a palliative care teal also provide spiritual support for patients and their families. Pharmacists \u2014 These licensed healthcare professionals work in hospitals and pharmacies to dispense prescription medication. They are a great resource and provide information and education on the safe and effective use of medications. Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 4 / PAGE 4.4Rehabilitation Therapists After most major surgeries or injuries, it is common to need some rehabilitation therapies to improve physical strength, coordination, communication, mobility, or mental functioning. These treatments can greatly enhance a person's ability to function and thus improve quality of life. Your loved one's neurosurgeon or neuro-oncologist will likely prescribe rehabilitation therapies after surgery or during ongoing treatment. If your loved one is not prescribed rehabilitation that you think he or she would benefit from, you can consult with a nurse or social worker and request these services. Some of these therapies are available in-patient (while the patient stays at a center) or outpatient (day treatment) at a clinic or your home. Call your insurance company before beginning treatment to determine if they will cover services or if you will need to pay out of pocket. Here are examples of common rehabilitation specialists. Occupational therapist \u2014 This is a licensed practitioner who helps people regain independence in self care, work, and day-to-day functioning, by adapting tasks or the environment (such as incorporating assistive devices) to meet the person's capabilities and level of function. Physical therapist \u2014 This is a licensed practitioner who works with patients following disease, injury, or loss of a body part, to restore physical function and prevent disability. The therapist evaluates physical factors such as pain, endurance, strength, and balance and treats them with exercises and adaptive equipment. Speech therapist \u2014 This therapist specializes in diagnosis and treatment of disabilities in speech, language, voice function, swallowing, and non-verbal communication such as facial expressions. Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 4 / PAGE 4.5Caregiving in the Hospital Hospital Admissions Before your loved one is admitted to the hospital, an admissions counselor may call to obtain preliminary information, provide important information regarding the hospital stay, and answer questions. The doctor also may schedule routine medical tests, such as laboratory tests or X-rays, before hospitalization. Other routine tests may be done on the day of admission and throughout the hospital stay. Most hospitals have Patient Pre-Admissions Guides to provide families with specific information on the hospital's services. You may obtain a copy of this through patient services. Medical Team Schedules Once admitted into the hospital, patients are typically seen by housestaff and attending physicians. After the initial evaluation, patients are generally seen by physicians on a regular daily schedule called \"rounds.\" It is helpful to know your loved one's doctors' rounding schedules so that you can be present to ask questions when they visit. Nursing schedules vary; most nurses are on 12-hour shifts. Residents commonly make rounds in the early morning, between 6:30-7:30 a.m. Attending physicians' rounds vary from mid-day to late in the evening. Ask your loved one's doctor a day in advance when he or she expects to be in, and allow a window of one to two hours around that time so you are present when the doctor visits. Keep a daily list of any questions you may have for your loved one's doctor, and remember to write down the answers.What to Expect When Your Loved One Has Surgery Knowing what to expect when your loved one has surgery, including timelines of procedures, tests, and hospital stay, will prepare you and reduce your stresses. The following is a list of what a patient's pre- and post surgery may look like: 1 The patient is admitted to the hospital the morning of surgery. 2 The patient goes into the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) after the surgery. 3 The patient is often transferred out of ICU to a regular floor bed the next day. 4 The patient should be eating and increasing activity levels as he or she is able. 5 There typically will be a post-operative MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) within 48 hours of surgery. 6 The Neuro-Oncology doctor will see and discuss their role after surgery. 7 The patient may return home in about three days if: pain is controlled on oral pills he/she is eating food, drinking fluids, going to the bathroom and walking safely independently 8 Patients routinely go home before receiving a pathology report on their tumor (the extent of the tumor and whether it is cancerous, or malignant). 9 Neuro-Oncology doctors will contact the patient when the final pathology is known and treatment plan is formulated. 1 0 The Neuro-Oncology team sees the patient typically within two to three weeks and assumes care, except for issues related to the surgical incision. Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 4 / PAGE 4.6In the first two to three weeks after surgery, call your neurosurgery team with questions or concerns. From that point on, call either the neuro- oncology team, your local treating oncologist, or the radiation MD. You may call and ask for the surgical coordinators first, so they can help you figure out whom to speak with. Preparing for Hospital Discharge Once the surgery is over, you will discuss discharge plans with your loved one's health care team, including the services and treatments your loved one will need once they leave the hospital. A patient may require nursing care or physical therapy at home after hospitalization. If your loved one is not physically able to return home upon discharge, staying in a skilled nursing facility or rehabilitation hospital may be necessary for some period after hospitalization. Before leaving the hospital, you can schedule an appointment or ask to page your neurosurgery team's social worker or case manager. These professionals are available through the Neurosurgery Department, UCSF Care Coordination, and the UCSF Cancer Center to discuss what treatments or services the doctor is prescribing as \"medically necessary,\" resources that you may need for home caregiving, and the best ways to obtain services. Other non-profit agencies such as the American Brain Tumor Association, American Cancer Society, and Cancer Care may offer social work services to families online or via telephone. Social workers also provide emotional support in the hospital and help with communication with the medical team. They try to understand each patient and family's unique background, current situation, and future needs to try to help families adjust to and cope with illness and caregiving. They can help with issues including: Rehabilitation Skilled nursing facilities Nursing homes Disability services and finances Insurance issues Medi-Cal Para-transit Referrals to counseling Short-term lodging Discussion of financial issues Advance Directives Hospice Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 4 / PAGE 4.7Caregiving in the Clinic Doctors' offices and clinics are similar in many ways, except that a clinic is usually the outpatient service of a larger health system like a public health department or university medical center. Clinics, like those at UCSF , often have a variety of health services available such as social workers, physical and occupational therapists, and mental health services. The health facility you visit may be determined by the location of your doctor or your health plan requirements. Preparing for a Doctor's Visit Time is limited in busy medical practices for patients with serious and sometimes complex medical issues. Appointment times vary from 30-45 minutes for an initial visit to 15 minutes for follow-up visits. Preparing for your visit in advance will be helpful for you and your loved one's doctor. The day before your visit, review the treatment log and notes sections of your health care binder (see chapter 2) in case your loved one has experienced significant symptoms, side effects, or pain that you should tell the doctor about. Highlight the important questions you want answered, and leave space to write down responses, whether you ask the questions in person, on the telephone, or via email. Topics you may want to ask about include: The cause of the illness Possible treatments Time frame for treatments Medical tests and procedures involved Medical team contact information What to expect during and after treatment Prognosis and the outcomes of treatment Potential lifestyle changes How to handle medical emergenciesCommunicating with the Medical Team Although some of these topics may be uncomfortable to talk about, it is almost always very helpful to get the issues out in the open. Some physicians raise serious issues like side effects and prognosis, while others may wait until you bring them up. There are no questions or concerns about your loved one that anyone should consider silly or trivial. All of your questions are important ones. Keep in mind that not all questions can be answered. In the treatment of serious medical illness, even by world-class doctors, some things remain unknown. Your doctors and nurses can help you deal with the ambiguities and uncertainties of medical care. Having an open, communicative relationship with your loved one's doctors can help you and your loved one make the best choices with the most information. Practicing good communication techniques will help you develop and maintain an effective relationship with your loved one's medical team. It is important to share your thoughts so that the doctor can address your concerns and provide better support. 2 Medical terminology can be complicated, so be sure to ask questions when you don't understand something. Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 4 / PAGE 4.8Patients and family members often have different needs for information. Some people want to know as much as possible, often to feel in control, while others may feel overwhelmed when they are given a lot of information. Ask yourself, \"How much information do I want?\" and communicate that with the medical team. There may be many people in your family with questions about your loved one's illness and treatment. It is helpful for the doctors to have a single family member collect all the questions and act as the family representative. However, most doctors are happy to speak with anyone in the family who wants to be addressed directly. As a caregiver, you have a valuable role as a facilitator between your loved one and the doctor. This is a very important role, particularly if your loved one needs help learning how to communicate with the doctor. You can also make sure the doctor's recommendations will be put into action. NOTE: You may be tempted to speak with the doctor directly, without your loved one being present, but this approach may not work. Patient confidentiality considerations may prevent a physician from being candid if your loved one is competent to be in charge of their own health care, but not present at the visit. On the Day of the Visit Bring your health care binder with your questions, treatment log, and medication log to review with the nurses or doctor. At the beginning of the visit, let the doctor review the list of questions you have so that he or she knows which issues to address (or can make plans to address them at another time). Your doctor will answer many of your questions during the course of the visit, so you can usually save asking many of your questions until the end of the visit. You may find it helpful to bring an audio recorder to your appointment so that once you are home, you can review important information discussed. This will also help to remind the doctor that this is new information for you and your loved one. Be sure to ask your physician first if he/she is comfortable with recording the conversation. When you feel you need more information than time will allow, ask the doctor or nurse to recommend reading material or websites to help you understand. Bring questions about insurance claims, billing, and other administrative matters to the administrative personnel \u2014 avoid using the limited time you have with the doctor to discuss billing and insurance issues. Nurses are valuable members of your loved one's medical team and can answer questions about the daily issues you face at home. Get to know them, and don't hesitate to ask them questions. Bring the contact information of your local treating physician or your referring physician to your appointments so that the clinic staff can communicate with them about important health information when necessary. Write down contact information (phone numbers, email addresses, clinic hours) for nurses and physicians you'll be working with. Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 4 / PAGE 4.9What Are Clinical Trials? \" A clinical trial provides the means by which your doctors can evaluate an important scientific question relating to your cancer. In most cases, the question of interest is whether a new drug or novel treatment approach is better than an existing treatment or at least worthy of further evaluation.\" - Paul Hesketh, MD, Lahey Clinical Medical Center. Aclinical trial is a research study that has progressed from a scientific question through laboratory testing and is now ready for human volunteers. Clinical trials are critical to the development of new brain tumor treatments. These new treatments may include drugs, surgical procedures, and new ways to manage side effects. The clinical trials process is overseen by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a local institutional review board (also known as an ethics committee), and a physician specifically trained to manage clinical trials. 3 What are the potential benefits of clinical trials? Participating in a clinical trial may have several potential benefits for patients. By participating in the trial, a patient will: Play an active role in determining the direction of his/her health car e Have access to new treatments before they are widely available Receive expert medical care at leading health car e facilities Help others by contributing to medical research What are the risks of clinical trials? Before your loved one agrees to participate in a clinical trial, he or she should talk to your oncologist and the doctor in charge of the trial to make sure he or she understands the possible risks. The treatment being used may not be better and side effects may be worse than the standard treatment. Because the treatment is new, the healthcare team may not know all of the side ef fects that may be experienced. A clinical trial may require more time and attention from the healthcare team and from the participant than would a non-clinical trial treatment regimen. This extra time may include trips to the cancer center, more treatments, hospital stays and complex dosage requirements. When do I ask the healthcare team about participating in a clinical trial? Any time a patient is facing a treatment decision, he or she should ask about clinical trials that might be appropriate. Clinical trials are not just for advanced stage brain cancer - clinical trials are available for all stages of brain cancer. Ideally, the entire healthcare team will be available to talk about new treatments that may be available. For example, the oncologist, radiologist, and surgeon may each have access to information about different clinical trials. Once a patient knows about clinical trials that might be appropriate, he or she should discuss the options with the team, who can help explain the benefits and risks based on the specific tumor and health status. How can I find clinical trials? There are several clinical trials in the U.S. available to the brain cancer community. However, not all clinical trials will be available in every area. Clinical trials may be open at only one cancer center; others may be open in hundreds of cancer centers across the country. The number of participating centers depends on the disease being studied, the phase of the clinical trial, and the complexity of the clinical trial. Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 4 / PAGE 4.10If your loved one is interested in participating in a clinical trial, there are many sources of information. The two best sources of information are: The healthcare team (e.g. oncologist, radiologist, pulmonologist, etc.) - Ask the healthcar e team if a clinical trial is appropriate at this time and what clinical trials are available at your center. If no trials are available at your center, ask the oncologist which investigational drugs or procedures might be right for the patient. With this information, you can search the government database for clinical trials in your area. U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) website of clinical trials located at http://ClinicalTrials.gov. There are many other internet sites with information on clinical trials, but these sites ar e generally built on information from the NIH website. This website lists both federally funded and privately supported clinical trials. Another good site for brain tumor patients is T rial Connect, the American Brain Tumor Association's clinical trial matching service.

Will the care change based upon response to the tr eatment during the trial? What are the risks and benefits? How long will the trial last? Who pays for the trial? Will insurance cover the treatment? Will the patient be paid? Can the patient be forced or asked to leave the trial? Can the patient learn the results of the trial? What is the time commitment to participate in a clinical trial? Are there extra visits required if I participate in the trial? If so, how many extra visit to the study center ar e required? 1 National Brain Tumor Society; www.braintumor.org.

Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 4 / PAGE 4.11Chapter 5 Communicating with Children and Your Partner about IllnessIn this chapter: How to Speak with Your Childr en about Cancer Helpful Communication T echniques Discussing Relationship and Intimacy Issues When someone has brain cancer, it affects the entire family. Though it is a complicated disease to understand and describe, it is better to discuss it with your family than to avoid communicating or acting as if life were normal. Children of almost any age sense when something is wrong, and they need to understand what is happening. No matter what their age, there are ways to communicate with children about cancer, treatment, and, if necessary, life and death. This chapter will give you strategies for talking with children of various ages about a loved one's illness. Cancer can also cause difficulties in your relationship with your partner or spouse. Here you will find some suggestions for how to be open with one another during this time. Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 5 / PAGE 5.1 How to Speak with Your Children about Cancer When children witness someone in their family with a serious illness, it is scary for them and it can cause emotional stress. Recent research suggests that children often suspect that something is wrong even before they are told of the diagnosis. It is common for parents to underestimate their children's need for difficult information and preparation, resulting in children feeling less control and more afraid 1. As a parent, you can help your family overcome fears by explaining the situation in ways they understand and keeping them informed. However, the amount of information children want and need varies by developmental level, and can be different for children of the same age 2. This section has a chart of children's development by stage, including information about emotional development, communication, and play techniques. These are suggestions to help you familiarize your child with what is going on and manage the anxiety they may have 3. Understanding your children's level of emotional development may give you insight into their feelings and behaviors and will help you speak with them about difficult issues. As a parent, you already have an intuitive sense for how much explaining your children want about difficult issues. Pay attention to your children's response to your talks. Be sensitive to the times when they want to know more, as well as to the times when they are less interested or seem overwhelmed with too much information. With the possibility, or in some cases the eventual reality of a death in the family, children will struggle with many of the same questions adults do. Where does someone go when he or she dies? Why did this disease happen? Especially for younger children, the worry that they did something to cause their loved one's illness or death is exceedingly common. All families need to deal with these issues. For many families, religious or spiritual traditions can provide a meaningful framework to help with the ambiguous ideas and painful feelings around illness and death. Discussing these difficult issues from within your family's belief system may bring your kids a reassuring sense of security. If you are a part of a religious or spiritual community, its members may be able to provide suggestions or speak with you and your children together. Whether or not you are religious, paying attention to issues of meaning, values, and relationships remains critically important 4. Helpful Communication Tips5 Describe the illness and treatment. Use appropriate language for your children's age. Read picture books to younger children. Practice your explanations. Your discussions will be most effective if you know beforehand what you are going to say and the words you will use, and if you are calm and able to focus on your children's questions. When you talk to your children, there is no way to predict their response. They may surprise you with their insight, or they may have their own ideas and explanations. Avoid overcorrecting them and allow them the chance to offer their own explanations as well. Young children may think they (or someone else) may have done something to cause the cancer. If this idea comes up as you talk to your children, reassure them that no one causes cancer to happen. If your children do not raise the idea, then you should avoid talking about fault, as it could lead them to wonder if, in fact, they did have a role. Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 5 / PAGE 5.2 Explain that cancer is not contagious. Young children think all illnesses are caught like colds. Assure them that no one in the family will get cancer as a result of spending time with the ill family member. Be honest and realistic. It is best to offer realistic but hopeful information so that children do not feel scared or confused if things happen differently than you suggest. Prepare for treatments. They can have side effects, such as hair and weight loss, that can frighten children and will make people look different. Prepare kids beforehand, and explain that treatments are helpful even if they look very unpleasant. Let children help. Allowing your kids to be involved in small caregiving tasks will make them feel helpful; make sure the tasks you involve them in are appropriate for their age and do not burden them with stress. Use resources and educational material. There is an abundance of helpful books and websites that will prepare you with age-appropriate language and tools for how to discuss illness and death with children of all ages and levels of cognitive development.

They must handle many decisions and changes. Some couples feel that the diagnosis and disease bring them closer together, while others find that they become disconnected. The most important thing you can do is be open about your stress and the causes. Allow times to talk about how you feel Share how you are coping Look for things that are causing you both stress Talk about choices you can make together Try to be grateful for each other Make time to focus on things besides the tumor Talk with your partner if you find that your sex life is different than it used to be. There can be many causes: You or your partner is tired Your relationship is strained If your partner is the patient: Either of you may not feel so good about how your partner looks You may be afraid to hurt your partner The treatment might be affecting your partner's ability to perform. He/she may be in pain or depressed. You can still be close as a couple in spite of these issues. Staying close is about sharing feelings and understanding. You can: Talk about your closeness and your sex life Talk about your hopes for the future Try not to judge each other Protect your time together Be patient and take things slowly Talk to a counselor or your support group 1 Cancer Care, www.cancercare.org .

You may even find that personal finances and health insurance are the obstacles preventing you from selecting the best care for your loved one. At the point that your loved one requires a particular treatment, it is likely that you will do whatever you can to provide that care, including sacrificing personal finances and compromising your family's stability. But there are ways to avoid having to make these painful choices. Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 6 / PAGE 6.1 Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 6 / PAGE 6.2 As medicine and health care improve, people are living longer with serious and chronic illnesses. Long-term care has become a part of modern living, and there are resources available to help you plan for this. Start by familiarizing yourself with your loved one's health insurance plan, as well as government entitlements and public assistance. These are confusing systems to navigate through, but inquiring early on will empower you to obtain the care your loved one needs, when it's needed, at a reasonable price or perhaps for free. If you approach these important administrative tasks of caregiving early on, you may prevent unnecessary financial pressures and compromises regarding work, housing, and education. Once you get insurance benefits and government assistance in order, you can better attend to your loved one's needs at home and make quality care available. This chapter outlines the basics you should learn about when planning for and purchasing care. It will also give you tips for advocating for your loved one to secure medications, treatments, and services if payment is denied.Working with Your Loved One's Insurance Company The two basic categories of insurance are public (government- sponsored insurance) and private (insurance plans purchased by you or provided by an employer). You may have one of the following types of government-sponsored insurance plans \u2014 Medicare or MediCal \u2014 or a private plan such as fee-for- service or managed care. Managed care plans include: Preferred Provider Organizations (PPO), Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO), and Point of Service plans (POS). Insurance plans have their own distinct systems that may control your choice of health care providers and the services you can obtain. Contact your insurance company or your employer's health benefits manager to learn what the benefits are. Your loved one's coverage plan will determine what treatments will be covered in full, and what portion of the cost you will be responsible for paying. If your coverage is Medicare or Medicaid, read the free consumer materials that explain your coverage and your rights. You can also contact an advocacy organization such as the American Brain Tumor Association (1-800-886-2282) and the National Brain Tumor Society (1-617-924-9997). These organizations provide educational materials, resources for care, and helpful support networks online and by telephone. It is common for insurance companies to cover treatments that the doctor prescribes as \"medically necessary\" or \"required medical events.\" The care prescribed by the doctor may be a combination of services and is based on the complexity of the patient's needs. Services the doctor prescribes as \"medically necessary\" may include: Therapies: speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy Treatments: radiation, chemotherapy, medications Interim treatment facilities: rehabilitation hospital, skilled nursing facility Home care services: professional nursing, social work, nutritional careBecause many tests, procedures, and treatments require authorization by your insurance company, it is best to verify that the service will be paid for by the insurance carrier before receiving it. Review a copy of your loved one's policy and review it carefully. Find out exactly what services are covered and how the payment system works. Be aware of annual limits and lifetime limits (often $1 million), and research purchasing additional coverage. Also make sure that you are aware of the policy's regulations on the following: Co-payments Deductibles Referrals to physicians and other clinicians Services covered (follow up appointments, MRIs, medications, therapies, treatments, clinical trials, home care, reimbursement for complimentary and alternative services)The Children's Brain Tumor Foundation recommends taking the following steps in dealing with the insurance company 1: Educate yourself. Know about your loved one's illness and why referrals to specialists are needed. Many insurance plans and HMOs require that specialized tests, procedures and treatments must be pre-approved and authorized by a primary care provider. You may need this \"authorization\" when you call to make an appointment with a specialist. Ask for one \"case manager\" at the insurance company who will always handle your case and answer questions. Ideally you will find someone who is sympathetic to your case and time constraints. Document every phone call. Write down the name of the person you speak to, the date and time, and the topic discussed. Fill out every form completely. Payment may be delayed or denied if information is missing. You may want to send in claim forms \"Return Receipt Requested.\" Someone of authority will have to sign for it. Develop a good working relationship with your loved one's primary physician's office staff because authorizations must come from there. Keep a copy of each authorization you receive. Follow up on authorizations and never assume that they are being handled. You may want to tell the specialists that you will get the necessary authorizations yourself. Sometimes the referral process to specialists or therapies is slow. You may have to emphasize the serious nature of your loved one's illness in order to get an earlier appointment or referral. Don't wait for the doctor's office or insurance company to call you back. Call every day if necessary. Be polite but persistent. Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 6 / PAGE 6.3When Insurance Won't Pay Your options for obtaining services that are not regularly covered by your insurance include: Paying out-of-pocket Submitting claims to your insurance company Fighting denied claims by making appeals with the support of your health care provider (see \"Appealing a Decision,\" at right) Using state and non-governmental agencies to help assist insurance complaints Applying for social services (county- or state-run) to provide you with services (see \"Seeking out Government Entitlements and Private Financial Assistance,\" on the next page) Obtaining health care services that are offered by charitable or non-profit organizations at reduced or no cost Engaging the help of a professional advocate (see \"Professional Advocates,\" below)Appealing a Decision You may find over time that there are services your loved one needs or wants that are not covered, or are denied, by your insurance carrier. Sometimes a denial occurs because of incorrect documentation or other logistic issues. At other times a service may be denied because your policy has exclusions. However, you may appeal to your insurance company to pay for the services that may have been denied. Your insurance company can tell you how to appeal a decision. In trying to make an appeal, you may ask your doctor or health insurance advocacy organization to help you obtain the services you need by submitting letters of medical necessity. Your local state legislator can also intervene with your insurance company so that your loved one receives the service for which they are paying insurance premiums. Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 6 / PAGE 6.4Professional Advocates If a service you request is denied, you may obtain the help of an advocacy service to work with your family and doctor to assist you through the appeal process. Examples of professional advocates who are responsible for representing the patient's interest include: Patient Advocates \u2014 assist patients and concerned families and friends. They can get involved in nearly any facet of patient care and are available in most hospitals. Ombudsmen \u2014 advocate for residents of nursing homes, board and care homes, and assisted living facilities. They can be called for any concerns around care or for a referral to a patient advocate. Ombudsmen provide information about how to find a facility and what to do to get quality care. Under the federal Older Americans Act, every state is required to have an Ombudsman Program that addresses complaints and advocates for improvements in the long-term care system. Payment and Billing Advocates \u2014 can investigate and resolve problems concerning insurance payments or Medicare/Medicaid. They are available in the finance departments of medical clinics or hospitals. Social Workers and Discharge Planners \u2014 help patients get in-home support services, equipment, transportation, financial benefits, and community services. They may be available in your medical clinic and are available privately.Seeking out Government Entitlements and Private Financial Assistance As a result of illness in your family, you may find that you need to cut back on work hours to give care and help your loved one adjust to life changes. If you are making changes to your employment, inquire with the Human Resources department at your work to learn the policies on sick leave, paid time off, the Family Medical Leave Act, or your flexibility of work hours. Changes to your employment status can mean lost income and changes to your health benefits. But these changes may also make you eligible to receive entitlements through government programs. Be aware that there are both government programs and privately sponsored services in place that you may financially qualify for, to help provide your loved one with the needed care. The following lists are examples of government and non-government programs that offer entitlements, income supplements, low-cost health care services, and financial subsidies. These services may be controlled by the city, county, state or federal government, or non-governmental organizations. Be sure to speak with a case manager at the hospital or clinic, or a health care advocate at an organization such as the National Brain Tumor Foundation, to help you apply for these services.

Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 6 / PAGE 6.5Chapter 7 Planning for the FutureIn this chapter: Advance Care Planning Personal Business Estate Planning Most people don't like to discuss their wishes for what will happen at the end stages of their life or directly after death. But there are many important decisions, including what types of health care are wanted toward the end of life and what will happen to one's assets when one dies. This chapter introduces some of the most important plans for you to help your loved one make, including plans for advanced care, financial plans, and estate plans. Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 7 / PAGE 7.1 Advance Care Planning Part of helping someone live well with a serious illness involves accommodating his or her needs as the illness progresses. Although you may be dealing with adjustments to daily living, it is important that you and your loved one talk in advance about his or her beliefs, values, and wishes for end-of-life care. If you wait until your loved one is badly debilitated before getting these affairs in order, it may be too late for him or her to express requests, make rational decisions, and sign important documents. Advance care planning (for yourself as well as your loved one) includes: Learning what life-sustaining treatments are available (artificial nutrition and hydration, extended mechanical ventilators, resuscitation, etc.) Deciding what medical treatments your loved one would want if his or her cancer becomes life-threatening Communicating with your loved one about his or her personal values and spiritual beliefs about death and dying Deciding who your loved one would want to speak for him or her and make decisions about his or her care if unable to do so for him or herself Preparing legal documentation of your loved one's end-of-life preferences (advance directives) and giving copies to health care providers Advance directives are a set of documents that allow your loved one to identify his or her wishes for care at the end stages of life, in the case he or she is not able to do so at the necessary time \u2014 specifically a living will and a medical power of attorney. Once the advance directives are completely filled out, they should be signed and dated, and copies should be kept at home and also included in the patient's medical records. Once they are signed they become legal, official forms. These documents may vary by the state you live in, and you can obtain your state's version from your doctor, legal offices, or state departments. Living Will A living will is the part of the advance directives that document the patient's wishes about the medical care that he or she wants at the end of life. These written instructions are used if the patient is physically or mentally unable to communicate wishes at the time. This document is extremely valuable because it protects a patient's rights to accept or refuse care, and it removes the burden of life-or-death decisions from family members or the medical team. It is important to know that someone can decide to refuse \"aggressive medical treatment to attempt to cure a disease\" but not refuse all medical care. In other words, the patient can specify not to be kept alive artificially, but to be provided with comfort care (pain medication). Typical information included in a living will: DNR (do not resuscitate) orders \u2014 instructions to refuse CPR if breathing or heartbeat stops Choices about artificial hydration and nutrition Choices about life-sustaining equipment (ventilators, respirators) Choices about comfort care (pain medications) Instructions about being an organ and tissue donor Medical Power of Attorney The medical power of attorney is the part of the advance directive that names a patient's health care proxy. A health care proxy is whom the Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 7 / PAGE 7.2patient designates to make decisions regarding end-of-life care if the patient is unable to do so. Typically this is someone whom the patient knows well and trusts will make decisions that represent the patient's wishes in case they are not well stated. The health care proxy is often a spouse or relative of the patient. The patient should make sure to ask this person if he or she agrees to be the health care proxy, and, if so, the person designated must sign the form. Palliative Care Palliative care (pronounced pal-lee-uh-tiv) is specialized medical care for people with serious and/or life-threatening illnesses. Palliative care focuses on providing patients with relief from the symptoms, pain, and stress of a serious illness. The goal of palliative care is to improve quality of life for both the patient and their family. Palliative care is provided by a team of doctors, nurses, social workers, and other health professionals who work together with a patient's care team to provide an extra layer of support to the patient and their family. Palliative care is appropriate at any age and any stage of a serious illness, and can be provided alongside curative treatment. In fact, many organizations recommend that palliative care be initiated early in the illness and that tis be an integral part of the treatment plan. Palliative care focuses on symptoms such as pain, fatigue, constipation, nausea, difficulty sleeping, anxiety and depression. By successfully managing these symptoms, patients are ideally able to more fully participate in and enjoy daily life. Palliative care can improve you loved one's ability to tolerate medical treatments. It can also help them better understand their treatment choices and feel an enhanced sense of control around their medical care. Palliative care teams are present in some hospitals; an increasing number of outpatient palliative care clinics exist as well. If you are interested in seeing a palliative care doctor, ask your oncologist about services available in your area. Hospice It is important to note that palliative care and hospice care are not interchangeable terms. Hospice is a specific type of palliative care aimed at patients with life-limiting illness. Hospice is a model of care that emphasizes comfort and management of pain and symptoms, when an illness is expected to lead to death within six months and curing it is not an option. It is appropriate for you, as the caregiver, to discuss hospice with the medical team and your loved one at any time when facing a potentially life-limiting illness. Ultimately, however, your loved one will make the final decision about starting hospice care. If the disease goes into remission or a cure becomes available, a patient can stop hospice and begin aggressive curative attempts again. If a patient decides to begin hospice care, he or she can be admitted to an in-patient hospice center or remain at home and have regular visits from the hospice staff. Hospice care is comprehensive and includes physical, psychological and spiritual care to address issues such as pain management, adjusting the home to meet the patient's needs, providing necessary medical equipment, and counseling and grief services for the patient and family. Most insurance companies cover hospice care, and it is covered by Medicare nationwide. Speak with your insurance carrier to determine your loved one's coverage and co-pay. If coverage is unavailable, the hospice team may be able to use community or foundation funds to provide services - 1. Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 7 / PAGE 7.3Personal Business In addition to the difficult decisions involving physical, emotional, and spiritual care at the end of life, most people have personal business that will require management by someone who can be trusted. Naming someone to take charge of financial affairs is called durable power of attorney for finances. This is separate from the advance directive described above, but a patient may choose the same person. Some financial institutions may only recognize the persons named on an account to make decisions about it, so it's important to not wait until the patient is too ill to make changes or add a secondary name on an account. The same goes for other financial assets and legally binding documents such as investments, properties, and car titles. Adjusting the information on important documents before the patient becomes too ill may prevent years of legal battles and financial burdens. The following is a list of important topics to become familiar with. If you need to learn more about these you can meet with an associate at your bank, seek advice from a legal service, call your hospital to speak with Patient Relations or a Social Worker, or search the Internet. Bank Accounts \u2014 Pay-On-Death beneficiary designations; do you need to add co-signers? Safe Deposit Boxes \u2014 where are the keys? Who are the co-signers? Life Insurance Policies \u2014 who are the beneficiaries? Do they need amending? Health Insurance Policies \u2014 where are membership cards? What are the ID numbers? Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care \u2014 has this been signed? where is original? Do health care providers have copies? Durable Power of Attorney for Finance \u2014 who has been designated? What is their contact information? Will and/or Living Trust \u2014 Where are they? What attorney drafted them? Deeds/Property Titles \u2014 Who has ownership of the property? Does \"tenancy\" need to be designated? Stocks/Bonds \u2014 Who are the beneficiaries? Do they need to be amended? Birth Certificate \u2014 Know where your loved one was born in case you need to order one. Military Papers \u2014 If applicable, where are the discharge papers? Social Security Papers \u2014 Where are these documents? Benefits Forms \u2014 Have copies of all forms (SSI, SSDI, GA, MediCal, Food Stamps, etc.) Loan Papers \u2014 Keep payment contracts and credit card statements organized. Vehicle Registrations \u2014 Who is listed as the owner and where is the certificate? Income Tax Returns \u2014 Keep returns for the last five years and the accountant's contact information. Funeral Instructions \u2014 Is there a contract with a funeral home? Are wishes written down? Password Keeper \u2014 Where does your loved one keep this information? While certainly private, it is important to know where this information lives for emergency situations. Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 7 / PAGE 7.4Estate Planning Many people have things that they want to leave for their loved ones to remember them by \u2014 some form of a legacy \u2014 usually identified in a will. These inheritances can be in the form of financial gifts, family heirlooms, objects of sentimental importance, or even personal memoirs. Helping prepare a legacy with your loved one is a way to bring you closer by providing support that they may not know to ask for. If your loved one does not specify who is to inherit his or her belongings, each state has a formula that will disperse property out to your next of kin after a lengthy and costly process. If a person dies intestate (without a formal will) the state takes control of the property, determines the legal nearest blood relatives and disburses the estate to them. Many times property is sold, all the expenses are paid and what is left goes to the heirs. There are many issues involved in estate planning that you should be aware of. The best way to become educated on these topics is to seek legal advice or refer to a social worker at the hospital for references. The Internet can be very helpful because it will lead you to many resources and references, but make sure that the information has been written by a legitimate source such as a government or nationally known organization. Also, guarantee that the information you read is current and relevant to the state you live in. 1 Hospice Net, www.hospicenet.org . Retrieved 2013.

The signs of stress are well known: worry, anxiety, sadness, and other negative emotions begin to color each day. You may have trouble with sleep and during the day you may be tired or find it hard to concentrate, especially on tasks that seem irrelevant. Because of the effects of stress on the immune system, you may also experience more physical problems, including colds and flu, and other upper respiratory illness. It is easy for caregivers to put their own needs and feelings second or aside, but it is crucial to take care of yourself. Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 8 / PAGE 8.1 Surprisingly, even when things are going badly and stress is intense, people do have moments when they experience positive emotions such as joy, happiness, love, and compassion. And, in fact, except when the situation is truly dire, these upbeat moments occur surprisingly often over the course of a day or week 1. These positive moments are often fleeting, but they are very important because they help you sustain your well-being in the midst of stress. They can do this in several ways. They provide a \"breather\" from the distressing emotions that accompany stress. Many of these positive moments help motivate us and keep us going by reminding us of what matters. They can also help to reduce the harmful effects that can occur when the body is under stress for a long time. These positive moments sometimes just happen, but at other times, you can make them happen with specific coping strategies. These strategies don't make the stress of caregiving go away. But they can provide respite, renew purpose, and restore psychological resources that are often depleted by the stress of caregiving. These coping strategies do not require extensive training. You simply need to think about them to make them happen. Here are six strategies to help maintain your own well-being in the midst of stress: 1PRACTICE SELF-CARE STRATEGIES. Caring for your body and staying active: If possible, get at least 30 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous exercise per day, pay attention to what you are eating, get enough sleep, rest regularly (deep breaths, mediation, gentle stretching), and keep up with your own checkups, screening, and medications. Making time for yourself: Develop and maintain planned episodes of pleasurable self-renewal. For example, go to the movies, be by yourself, read a book, watch TV, visit with friends, or take a leisurely walk. Find something pleasurable and enjoy it. Joining a caregiver support group: In addition to providing information, support groups give you the opportunity to talk with others who are going through a similar situation, and may help you feel less alone. Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 8 / PAGE 8.22FOCUS ON WHAT MATTERS. Focusing on what matters can strengthen your sense of purpose and meaning in your life. It can help direct the choices you make and can help sustain you when the going gets tough. As a caregiver, you can get caught up in responding to day-to-day demands and easily lose sight of why these activities matter. As a result, your resources can become depleted and you can burn out. A family caregiver who participated in an important research project on stress in caregiving helps us understand the importance of reflecting on what matters. This man's partner had advanced AIDS during the time before effective treatments were available. He described a night that was much like most other nights when his partner experienced severe night sweats. The caregiver had to change the bed linen, sponge his partner and help him into fresh pajamas. This caregiver reported that he usually had to do this about four times during a night; the previous night, however, it had been eight times. And what got him through this night after night? He focused on what mattered to him \u2014 the underlying love they had for one another and how these efforts were an expression of that love. For some caregivers, what matters may have to do with love. For others it may have to do with a sense of what is right and moral, of what a \"good\" person does. It might have to do, for example, with valuing compassion and being able to reduce suffering. The most important thing is to be aware of what matters to you. Remind yourself of it, especially when things are going badly. Some people find it helpful to create a \"mattering\" list. What would be on your list? Why do these things matter to you? 3REALIGN YOUR PERSONAL GOALS ACCORDING TO WHAT MATTERS TO YOU. One of the reasons a diagnosis of a serious illness is often a shattering experience is that it means that the big life goals we had previously held no longer fit our changed reality. These big life goals, even those that we were not entirely conscious of, rise to the surface as we realize they are no longer realistic or they no longer seem to be as important as they once were. The awareness that life goals need to be changed can create intense stress. Putting important goals on hold, or even having to give them up, involves loss. It is not unusual for caregivers to feel sadness, anger, and resentment about this loss. But as a caregiver, you need to identify new goals in order to address the demands of your loved one's illness. Identifying realistic goals that matter now, in relation to your changed reality, can renew your sense of purpose, creating a heightened sense of energy that can motivate and direct you. It can help you marshal your resources to do what needs to be done. Here are three steps that can help with \"resetting\" goals: Think about the goals you had before your loved one became ill. They may have to do with goals you had for your family or at work. Some of these goals will no longer matter. Others will still matter, but are no longer realistic. Let go of goals, at least for now, that no longer matter or that are no longer realistic. This will reduce frustration, anger, and anxiety. At the same time, this may make you feel sad and possibly resentful and angry. Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 8 / PAGE 8.3 Identify new goals that matter and that are realistic. Many of these will be related directly or indirectly to your role as a caregiver. Think about why these new goals matter. Which of your underlying values do they represent? Knowing why they matter will reinforce your sense of purpose and your awareness of meaning in your life. Initially, it can help to focus on near-term goals over the next days or weeks. These can be very concrete goals, the kinds of things that you'd put on a To-Do list for the day. And, in fact, it is often helpful to make up a daily To-Do list that includes tasks that you are likely to get done that day or the next. Try to make these near-term goals as realistic as possible. If you set yourself up to be successful, you'll feel more capable and in control. In caregiving, long-term goals are often shared between the caregiver and the person who is ill. If possible, talk together about your shared long-term goals, what it is that you each want for the other and for yourself. These conversations can clarify what matters to your loved one, which is likely to shape your new goals. These conversations can increase intimacy and intensify feelings of affection and love. They can also decrease anxiety for both of you. 4BENEFIT FINDING AND BENEFIT REMINDING. Research on coping with stress shows that many people discover that they have benefited from their stressful experiences. Caregivers, for example, talk about how they've gained knowledge and skills that make them much more competent. Some caregivers talk about the increased intimacy that they experience with their loved one that comes from talking openly with one another or from appreciation the patient expresses for the caregiver's efforts. Other caregivers feel they have gained wisdom or that they have experienced deepened spirituality or religiosity. Some report that the family has become closer. Take time to reflect about ways in which you've grown, the skills and knowledge you've acquired; deepened spirituality or understandings of the world and your place in it; changes in relationships with your loved one, family members, and friends; or other benefits that have come from your caregiving experience. Then remind yourself about these benefits when you are feeling down. Orientation to Caregiving CHAPTER 8 / PAGE 8.4 5INFUSE ORDINARY EVENTS WITH MEANING. In a sense, this strategy is something like the old adages, \"take time to smell the roses\" or \"don't just do something; sit there.\" Positive moments occur throughout the day. They can be something as ordinary as not getting stuck in traffic, having a salesperson greet you in a friendly manner, or seeing a beautiful sunset. When such a moment occurs, take advantage of it. Dwell on it, reflect on why it makes you feel good. If you have the opportunity, tell someone about it. These moments give you an emotional time-out from anxiety and worry. They can help reduce your stress and restore you. You might want to reflect on a day's positive moments just before you go to sleep. This can help quiet distress and create an upbeat mood that can help you fall asleep. 6ALLOW YOURSELF TO LAUGH. Humor is one of the healthiest and most powerful methods to help provide perspective on life's difficult experiences, and it is frequently shared during periods of crisis. 2 To help find humor during a stressful time, think about what typically can make you laugh and bring it into your day. Don't feel guilty about your laughter \u2014 enjoy the moments of levity and know that they will help restore your energy and perspective. There is a body of research showing that humor and laughter can be very therapeutic and assist in the psychological recovery from crisis. 3 Laughter and humor have been shown to provide relief and even facilitate survival. It may at first feel like a challenge to find humor during a hard time, but take comfort in knowing that if you can not laugh today, you may be able to tomorrow. Bottom line: Positive moments and positive emotions are a part of the experience of stress. This may sound counterintuitive, but a lot of research supports this observation. Take advantage of these moments. They can help keep you focused on what matters and sustain you when things are especially difficult. Know what creates positive moments for you, and use some of the strategies described above or others that work for you so that you can make the most of these often fleeting, but very important, moments.

Orientation to Caregiving APPENDIX / PAGE A.13Pain Rating Scale The Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale is used in most doctors' offices, and is particularly helpful for patients who may be cognitively impaired. It offers a visual description for those who don't have the verbal skills to explain how their symptoms make them feel. You can explain that each face shows how a person in pain is feeling. That is, a person may feel happy because he or she has no pain (hurt), or a person may feel sad because he or she has some or a lot of pain. Helpful Instructions Point to each face using the words to describe the pain intensity. Have your loved one choose the face that best describes how he or she feels. Make note of the pain, with the date, and any other symptoms that occurred and keep this information in your medical records or journal. Bring your notes to your next appointment, or refer to them when on the phone with the nurse. You may find it helpful to fold this paper here and use the scale with your loved one to gauge his or her pain. 0 NO HURT1 HURTS LITTLE BIT2 HURTS LITTLE MORE3 HURTS EVEN MORE4 HURTS WHOLE LOT5 HURTS WORST Face 0 is very happy because he or she doesn't hurt at all. Face 1 hurts just a little bit. Face 2 hurts a little more. Face 3 hurts even more. Face 4 hurts a whole lot.

Reprinted by permissionOrientation to Caregiving APPENDIX / PAGE A.14Home Healthcare Primer What Is Home Care? Homecare is a general term that represents a wide range of community-based services to support someone that is recuperating from an acute situation, such as a hip fracture, or services needed by persons with ongoing chronic conditions, such as stroke or cerebral palsy. The skills and duties of home care personnel vary, but all have one thing in common \u2014 they make it possible for car e recipients to remain at home in a safe environment and, in some cases, have more independence than they did before. In the process, they also provide family caregivers with a chance to replenish their depleted physical and emotional reserves. Homecare personnel include: Registered nurses (RNs)\u2014that provide skilled medical car e, including giving medications, monitoring vital signs, dressing wounds, and teaching family caregivers how to use complicated equipment at home. Therapists\u2014that work with patients to r estore or maintain their motor, speech, and cognitive skills. Homecare aides\u2014who provide personal services such as bathing, dr essing, toileting, making meals, light cleaning, and transporting patients to the doctor. Companion/homemakers\u2014who help with chor es around the house but usually do not perform personal duties for the care recipient.Getting Started with Homecare If you are considering getting homecare help to assist you with your caregiving responsibilities and/or to get some time for yourself, there are a number of things you need to consider, and also things you need to know. The first step is to make sure you and your loved one ar e comfortable with the idea of someone else taking on some of the tasks that you've been doing by yourself. There are many care recipients that are totally opposed to the idea, and some negotiations will need to occur before any plan can be put in place. It is important for all concerned to understand what is prompting the need for homecare and the personal issues that lie beneath the refusal to consider it. Getting beyond objections isn't necessarily easy and you might need some guidance on how to go about it, perhaps from other family caregivers that have dealt with the issue or from professionals that counsel family caregivers. Defining the tasks that need to be done by the homecar e worker will help you determine exactly what type of homecare is most appropriate in your situation. Do you need a nurse to clean and bandage wounds and monitor equipment, a homecare aide to help your loved one get showered and dressed, or would a companion/homemaker be more appropriate in your circumstance? Once you know what type of assistance you need, and all parties agr ee that it is necessary or desirable, the inevitable questions about where to find homecare services, how much they will cost, and whether any of the cost is covered by insurance or provided by Orientation to Caregiving APPENDIX / PAGE A.15government programs must be asked and answered. Some federally funded programs, insurance companies, and health maintenance organizations (HMOs) do provide for some home health care services, but the coverage provided may not fit your needs. To be sure whether or not you have any coverage at all, it is imperative that you review your insurance benefits. If you're like the majority of family caregivers you need the most help with personal care tasks\u2014the very type of care that is not typically covered by private health insurance programs or Medicare. So unless your loved one had the foresight and the funds to purchase long-term-care insurance prior to becoming ill, your access to homecare will be limited by what you can afford. You may be able to get some help from state programs that take into account your ability to pay, and the age or extent of disability of your care recipient, but the sad reality is that more often than not the costs of homecare services will have to come out of your own pocket.Choosing the Right In-Home Care How do you find the right homecare solution for your family, the one that provides the services you need at a price you can afford? There are several ways of tapping into the homecare network. Here is a look at some of the most common ones and what you need to think about when considering them: Home Care Agencies Home Care Agencies are companies in the business of meeting homecare needs. Not all home care agencies provide the same variety and level of service, however, so make sure the agency you are considering can provide all the services you need. The issue isn't bigger or smaller but rather which one meets your criteria. If your care recipient is approved for skilled care that Medicare will pay for, it's vital that the agency be Medicare certified. This ensures that the agency has met federal minimum requirements. If your loved one only requires personal care or companion/homemaker care, Medicare certification need not be a factor in your decision. Some companies actually have two agencies that are legally separate but work together, one that is Medicare certified and one that is strictly private pay. Some agencies are accredited in addition to being certified. Well-known accrediting organizations are the National League for Nursing, the Joint Committee for Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, and the National Foundation of Hospice and Home Care. This type of certification tells you that the agency conforms to national industry standards, and there is always comfort in knowing you are dealing with an organization that has proven its worth to its peers. Orientation to Caregiving APPENDIX / PAGE A.16What do home care services cost through an agency? Some agencies charge flat fees ranging from $100 to $120 per visit. Others have a minimum two or four-hour fee. The actual hourly rate will vary depending on the services you require and the part of the country you live in, but don't be surprised to find rates ranging anywhere from $25 to $40 per hour. Questions to Ask Any Agency You Are Thinking of Working With Is the agency certified for participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs (where applicable)? How long has the agency been serving the community? Is the agency accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) or Community Health Accreditation Program (CHAP) or other recognized accrediting body? Does the agency provide an initial assessment to determine if the patient would be appropriate for home care and what those services might be? Does the agency provide all of the services you need? Can they provide flexibility to meet the patient's changing health care needs? How does the agency choose and train their employees? Are background checks made? Does it protect its caregivers with written personnel policies, benefit packages, and malpractice insurance? Does the agency provide literature explaining its services, eligibility requirements, fees, and funding? Does the agency have arrangements in place for emergencies? Are the agency's caregivers available 24 hours a day, seven days a week? How quickly can they start service? Are references from former clients and doctors available? What types of programs does the company have in place to assure quality care is provided? Will the agency go to bat for you if your insurance company or Medicare fail to cover a claim you and the agency thought should be covered? Privately Employed Home Caregivers Instead of using a home care agency, you may wish to hire a home care worker on your own, especially if you are not looking for skilled medical care, but rather for someone to act as a companion or personal aide on a regular, long-term basis. In those situations, bypassing commercial agencies can often result in significant financial savings. You can start your search by putting the word out to friends and neighbors that may know of a homecare worker. Also check with the nursing staff in your doctor's office, a hospital discharge planner, or community-based social service agencies for reliable candidates. Things to Think About If You Plan to Hire Private Homecare Help You yourself must do substantial background checks to ensure that the employee has no record of criminal activity or abuse. You must be prepared to do all the paperwork necessary to comply with tax and insurance laws affecting employees. You may not get candidates with the same level of training and licensure as those who work for home care agencies. You do not have the guarantee of substitute help if your home caregiver is ill or on vacation.Orientation to Caregiving APPENDIX / PAGE A.17Home Care Registries A good middle ground between home care agencies and hiring help on your own is a home care registry. Registries are somewhat like an employment agency. They screen, interview, and reference-check workers they refer to clients so you don't have to, but just as with homecare agencies you need to ask a lot of questions to assure yourself that they can provide the right personnel to meet your needs. Because members of a registry are independent contractors, their services are available at prices that are usually lower than agencies. Government In-Home Aide Services Many states and counties offer homecare services to residents who are aged or disabled. Some even offer services to family caregivers. Applications for aid are evaluated by state social workers that rank a candidate's needs according to a number of objective criteria, including whether the care recipient lives alone and what activities he or she can perform. Care recipients who qualify are provided with home care aides that can give personal (not medical) care, do light cleaning, change linens, prepare meals, and transport or escort the patient to the doctor. The aides are trained and licensed by the state. Fees are usually set on a sliding scale and can range anywhere from $1 to $20/hour, depending on the care recipient's ability to pay. To find out what services your state offers, call your state Department of Human Resources or state Health Department. But be forewarned: usually these agencies are overwhelmed with applications and the waiting list can be long. Hospice If you are caring for a loved one with a terminal illness, Hospice offers a number of services that can help. To qualify for in-home hospice care, you must have a doctor certify that your loved one is no longer seeking curative treatments and that he or she has \"months rather than years to live.\" Depending on your situation, Hospice will provide a social worker, a nurse who comes regularly to check medicines and vital signs, volunteers to sit with your loved one while you while you run errands or just get some rest, and home health aides who will bathe and clean the patient, tidy up the room, and fix a meal if necessary. Payment is usually through Medicare or private insurance. When you call your local Hospice office, a home health care coordinator will work with you to arrive at the best combination of services for your situation.

Orientation to Caregiving APPENDIX / PAGE A.20How to Communicate Your Loved One's Symptoms During a Crisis When your care recipient is in a medical crisis, your ability to observe symptoms carefully and report accurately might be, quite literally, life-saving. But that is also a time when it may be difficult to function clearly. Here is a list that will help you remember what to look for during a crisis. You may want to read it ahead of time, and then tuck a copy in your patient file for later reference. What time did the problem start? What was he doing when the problem started? Do you know or suspect what might have caused the problem? What was the first symptom that you noticed? What other symptoms/complaints do you remember? Did the symptoms come on abruptly or gradually? Was he given any medication or medical treatment just before the problem started? If so, what was it? Did the patient say anything about how he felt when the problem started and/or has it progressed? What was it? Does he have a history of this kind of problem? If so, what was the previous diagnosis? What did you do to try to help him between the time the problem arose and the time you arrived in the ER or the doctor's office? Did something work well? Seem to make things worse?When to Call for Help When is a crisis a crisis? When should you call someone else for help? Get help when your care recipient is in some kind of medical distress and you aren't sure what to do. Call your local rapid-response number (e.g., 911) or an ambulance if the person you are caring for: Is unconscious Has unexplained chest pain or pressure Is having trouble breathing or is not breathing at all Has no pulse Is bleeding severely Is vomiting blood or bleeding from the rectum Has fallen and may have broken bones Has had a seizure that lasts more than 5 minutes or has a second seizure before regaining consciousness after the first. Has a severe headache and/or slurred speech Has pressure or severe pain in the abdomen that does not go away Also call for help if: Moving the person could cause further injury The person is too heavy for you to lift or help Traffic or distance would cause a life- threatening delay in getting to the hospital NOTE: Although not a 911 call, it is usually a good idea to notify the doctor caring for the patient by phone if the patient is having an increase in symptoms such as weakness, difficulty speaking, or increased confusion or disorientation. Adapted from \"Communicating Effectively with Healthcare Professionals,\" Care Giver Action Network, caregiveraction.org . Orientation to Caregiving APPENDIX / PAGE A.21How to Communicate with Insurance Company Personnel Before you pick up the phone to speak to a claims representative, you need to gather some information. Be prepared to give the person you talk with: Your name and your relationship to your care recipient, Your care recipient's birth date, The insurance policy number, The name and address of the organization that sent the bill, The total amount of the bill, The diagnosis code on the bill, and The Explanation of Benefits (if you are questioning an insurance payment). When you start the conversation, ask for the name and telephone extension of the individual who is handling your phone call. If you need to call again, you will want to try to speak with the same person. Keep in mind that billing office personnel and insurance claims representatives are there to serve you. You are the customer. Be assertive. You should expect to: Be treated with respect and consideration, Have your concerns clarified, Have your questions answered with accurate and timely information, and Be informed of any steps you need to take to move things along.Communication Tips Here are some tips for communicating effectively with people who work in the health insurance system. Be Prepared. Before you call an insurance company, write down a list of the questions you have so you can handle everything in one phone call. Take Good Notes. Take notes about your phone conversations, including the name of the insurance representative, the date of the call and the information you were given. For convenience, put this in your care recipient notebook. Be Clear and Concise. State clearly and briefly what your question or concern is, what you need, and what you expect. Be Patient. Health insurance issues can be frustrating and time-consuming. Accept that you will spend a certain amount of time navigating through automated telephone menus, waiting on hold, and waiting for the claims process to be completed. Be Considerate. Most insurance personnel want to do their jobs well, and they have a tough job to do. Thank them when they have been helpful. Speak to them kindly. Assume that they are trying to help you. Follow Through. If the insurance company asks you to do something or to send additional information, do it right away. Don't let it slide. This will help them get the bill paid. Above all, be persistent. Stay in touch. Keep after an issue until it is resolved.
