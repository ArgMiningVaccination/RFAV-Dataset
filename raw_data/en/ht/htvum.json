Though if you do have PMS, you probably get the joke! More than 150 symptoms have been attributed to PMS! The symptoms are so common that the medical community considered discarding the term \"PMS\" and accepting the symptoms as normal! This attitude trivializes the daily significance of PMS for the millions of women women who suffer from it. For at least 5% of all menstruating women, the symptoms of PMS are so severe that they are incapacitated on a monthly basis. For many women, even moderate PMS can interfere with work and can disrupt everything from parenting to social relationships. What Causes PMS? PMS is, interestingly, less due to hormonal imbalances than it is due to imbalances in the stress hormones and the neurotransmitters (chemicals that control mood). Underlying factors: - Nutrient deficiencies (especially B6, vitamin E, vitamin A, calcium, and magnesium) - Low blood sugar - Stress and adrenal dysfunction (relationship, marital/sexual difficulties; workplace stress, money, etc.) - Thyroid problems can also cause PMS, so have your doctor check your thyroid hormones to make sure these are in proper order. - And while you're at it, get your iodine and vitamin D levels checked - when low these can contribute to depression and other related symptoms. Sometimes improving one factor alone can improve symptoms, but most often a combination approach of improved diet, improved lifestyle habits (for example, adequate rest, increased exercise, and changed beliefs about menstruation), and herbal and nutritional supplements are needed. Natural Approaches to PMS Natural approaches to PMS can transform your life! Here are my favorites! Go with YOUR Flow This may be the most important advice I can give to you. Recognizing the premenstrual time as one of naturally heightened awareness and emotions can actually help you to relax and get through a lot more easily. Rather than fight how you feel, go with it. Ways to do this include journaling your PMS feelings; setting aside time during the week before your period to pamper yourself with a hot bath, a cup of herbal tea, and a good novel; splurging for a massage; taking a yoga or dance class; or having a night out with your girlfriends. Pay close attention to the insights and feelings that arise during this time and record those in your journal. They may give you insight into some of your deeper feelings and point to things you might want to change in your life. Take the time to nurture yourself each month - eat better, rest more, move your body through exercise, and listen to your heart, mind, and spirit. Eat for Ease Here's where a plant-based diet can make a huge difference, so go Mediterranean-style if PMS is getting to you. A daily dose of dark leafy greens such as kale, collards, and broccoli and good quality fats are your ticket to the happier hormone party in general. If you're craving sugar or carbs before your period, your body is sending you a message. Before we bleed, as our estrogen drops, so do our levels of a feel-good brain-chemical (neurotransmitter) called serotonin drops. In response, your genius brain gets you craving pasta, pastries, and sugar, because guess what - serotonin can also be produced from carbohydrates. Which carbs you eat can make a huge difference in how you feel. Whole grains are packed with B-vitamins, for example, which also support an calmer mood. Sweet potatoes have lots of Vitamin A and other hormone and immune healthy nutrients. On the other hand. quick sugar sources like cookies actually deplete your nutrients while giving you a quick sugar high and then a low that just worsens our moods. Knowing that cravings are a message to bump up the healthy carbs, you might go for a homemade Goddess Bowl with rice noodles, an organic homemade Gluten Free Rise and Shine Muffin or two, or a lovely rice pudding with iron rich raisins or dried apricots, and coconut milk, rather than diving into that bag of Oreos (or Newman O's). And you don't even have to wait until you start having cravings; you can cycle some healthy carbs into your diet during the last half of your luteal phase - the week before your period - once or twice a day - to prevent the mood drop. And don't forget chocolate! It's known to prevent and reduce depression. How does it do that? It's also supporting neurotransmitter production that boosts mood. So consider a few ounces of good quality chocolate in your luteal phase and your period to be part of your healthy diet! Worries about gaining weight from eating chocolate regularly? Studies show just the opposite! Four oz of dark chocolate daily has been shown to offset cravings for other sweets, and keep weight and blood pressure in healthier ranges! Keep dairy products to a minimum to avoid any excess hormones coming into your system. Include cold-water fish (such as salmon and other low-mercury fish) a couple of times a week or take a high quality fish oil supplement.Dietary fats should come from olive oil, avocados, coconut oil, hemp oil, and other good quality oils. Women with PMS consume significantly more sugar, dairy products, salt and refined carbohydrates than those who do not experience it. Caffeine intake has also been linked to premenstrual discomforts, especially breast tenderness. Cutting out sugar, all white-flour products and caffeinated items such as coffee, black tea, and sodas may be hard to do but can go a long way to relieve symptoms. Interestingly, dark chocolate (62% or greater) is the exception to the caffeine rule - it can help improve mood and prevent or relieve depression. Adequate protein and fat at each meal will keep your blood sugar at a nice neutral hum - exactly where you want it to be to avoid the ups and downs of PMS and the roller coaster ride of imbalanced blood sugar - a gnarly combination! Rest and Replenish The importance of adequate rest and moderate exercise cannot be overstated for improving PMS symptoms. Fatigue from lack of regular sleep will exacerbate nearly all physical and emotional discomfort. Moderate exercise, even just walking or light cardiovascular exercise for as little as fifteen minutes three to four times per week can drastically improve mood and reduce fatigue. A boogie down dance party with a good sweat is even more fun! When we exercise, we are more likely to feel empowered in our lives and are more likely to take care of ourselves in ways that reduce PMS and improve overall quality of reproductive health. Hormone Intelligence Reclaim your power. Feel at home in your body. And be the force of nature you really are! PMS-Calming Supplements In addition to a healthy diet, several supplements are beneficial in reducing PMS, particularly for improvement of mood, reduction of bloating, and reduction of breast tenderness. These include: - Calcium citrate (up to 1,200 mg per day) - Magnesium citrate or glycinate (400 mg per day) - Vitamin B6 (50 mg per day as part of a B-complex supplement) - Vitamin E ( 400 IU per day) - DHA/EPA up to 2 gm combined, daily Herbs for PMS Herbs are powerful allies for us in many aspects of our reproductive cycles. PMS is no exception. Here are some of my favorites. Menstrual Cycle and Hormone Support Include herbs that help to regulate the hormones when treating PMS. Vitex (chaste berry) is probably the most commonly used and widely scientifically supported herb for treating PMS. Dosage is 2 to 5 ml of tincture one to two times daily, with one dose typically taken in the morning and the other midday. Interestingly, the cooking herb, saffron, also used medicinally, has born out in studies to be effective [in the treatment of depression and PMS with depression.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18271889/), at a dose of 30 mg/day (15 mg twice a day; morning and evening). Black cohosh and peony are also frequently used in formulas for PMS. Black cohosh can be used for treating menstrual headaches, breast tenderness, anxiety, and depression. Its effects may be due in part to its mild enhancement of serotonin reuptake. Peony has been shown to enhance ovarian function, improving levels of both estrogen and progesterone and reducing symptoms of PMS. A standard dose of black cohosh is one to two 40-mg capsules twice daily, or 2 to 4 ml of tincture one to three times daily. Stress Relieving Herbs These are herbs that support the nervous system improving mood, reducing headache, stress, and anxiety, and promoting overall relaxation. Passionflower, motherwort, St. John's wort, milky oats, and kava kava are some of my all time faves. These herbs may be used alone or in combination and with the exception of kava (which should be used for short durations only) they may be used throughout the month over an extended period of time, or just prior to and through the premenstrual time. Kava should be used only under the supervision of a qualified practitioner as it has been associated with liver disease, and no more than 1 ml twice daily for the week before the menses, and then discontinue. Feverfew, though not a nervine and more of an anti-inflammatory, may be especially appropriate when a woman also experiences premenstrual headache, as it has been shown to reduce migraines, especially when used preventively. Adaptogens for Mood and Energy [Adaptogens](https://avivaromm.com/adaptogens-beating-stress/) including ashwaganda, reishi, holy basil, and schisandra, for example, provide general support to the body, improving energy, sugar metabolism, mental functioning, mood, and general health. Among these are the adaptogenic herbs These can be taken alone or in combination, and for best results should be taken for a minimum of two to three months for optimal results. Dose depends on the herbs being used. Honoring the Magic of Our Cycles The menstrual cycle has long been a source of magic and mystery. Some cultures consider menstruating women to have strange and magical powers. The Polynesian word \"taboo,\" which in English has come to mean something that is forbidden, actually means both \"sacred\" and \"menstruating\" in its native language. Among many Native American tribes, menstruating women were considered more powerful even than medicine men. It is thought that how we view our bodies and menstrual cycles may influence how we experience menstruation. If a woman views menstruation negatively, with dread, or shamefully, all of which are deeply entrenched attitudes about menstruation, she may be more likely to experience menstrual difficulties than a woman who has a positive outlook on her body's natural functions. Ok, while I'm not saying that having your period is fun, there is no end to how our experience of our lives affects our biology. Many women today are embracing the menstrual cycle as a time of heightened emotional sensitivity, creativity, intuitiveness and personal power. The term \"moon time\" is sometimes used by women in place of the word \"period\" as a more poetic affirmation of this. Indeed, the words \"menarche,\" \"menses,\" and \"menstruation\" have their origin in the word \"moon,\" reflecting the cyclical nature of a woman's body in harmony with the monthly cycles of the moon. There is even a \"Red Tent\" Movement going on across this country, where women gather and share stories, ceremony, and helpful ideas and comfort. While PMS is certainly not just \"in your head,\" positive reframing may be an important part of helping women to overcome menstrual difficulties. Wishing you happier, "}
