We appreciate your attention to the methods we chose for conducting the upcoming meta-analysis. After careful consideration of your suggestions to revise a threshold for the I2 test, we agree that elimination of the 75% cut-off is suitable for addressing the first specific objective, which is to calculate the prevalence of sexual dysfunctions. The second specific objective is to find out the relationship between breast feeding types and sexual dysfunctions. To measure reliably the effect of particular feeding types on the likelihood of sexual dysfunction, we should analyze studies with matching cohorts and time since delivery. For high credibility of study findings, we will adhere to the common rule of assessing between-study heterogeneity and maintain a 75% threshold for the I2 index. In the \"Study design and data source\" section we highlighted the inclusion of peer-reviewed papers in the meta-analysis. However, recent studies advocate for necessity to cover grey literature and, in particular, official reports (1). Therefore, we decided to search for reports from local and international organizations. A method proposed by Naing et al. for an official national survey is not suggested by JBI (2)(3). We will consider this technique for critical appraisal of prevalence studies rather than for sensitivity...

In conclusion, we would like to thank you for providing suggestions on improvement the study methodology and encouraging greater reflection and debate. The proposed tools are acknowledged and can be considered at the time of statistical analysis of the literature. References: 1. Paez A. Gray literature: An important resource in systematic reviews.

Inequitable treatment as perceived by international medical graduates (IMGs): a scoping review. BMJ Open 2023;13:e071992.) At the time of writing, we were able to only access GMC data from 2020 (The changing medical workforce. General medical council [PDF]. 2020. P103. Available: https://www.gmc-uk.org/-/media/documents/somep-2020_pdf-84684244.pdf), which estimates the combined EEA (European Economic Area) and IMG (International Medical Graduate) figure at about 36%. Increased numbers of IMGs (including EEA) over more recent years, in the new data Al-Haddad has cited, calls for even greater need to better explore and action the needs and challenges faced by all IMGs in the UK and indeed across the world. We strongly support further study into this much needed area. Dear Editor I read with interest the paper by Jasim and co-authors that described a focus group exploration of patients' and public experiences of the UK NHS elective total joint arthroplasty pathway. (1) The results were interesting - especially when the patient journey was described as a maze rather than a pathway. Even though the number of participants was small, the message was clear: there was a lack of patient-centredness to the pathway. However, a greater issue is if anything can be done about the problem. In the future, it is likely that all care pathways will be electronic. Thus, it is tempting to believe that technological advances will enable the pathway to be much more personalised to the needs of individual patients. In the future, could pathways automatically start where patients are rather than where the system assumes they should? Could pathways automatically and immediately tell patients where they are in their journey so that they are fully informed in real time? Could pathways enable patients to get to their destination by the quickest possible route? Technology would also allow healthcare providers to continually track patients along different pathways. Doctors would see where patients might have been blocked and where some might have stepped off the pathway. This could potentially happen with all patients so the number of participants analysed would be far higher and results far more reliable. Yours Cath...

The study could capture sensible data, which is known to be notoriously difficult to acquire. But the study fails to achieve its primary objective, which is the feasibility of community surveillance for assessing suicides and attempt suicides. It only answers the second objective: added benefits of community surveillance to hospital and police records. India is often referred to as a 'nation within nations' and such community interventions studied in a specific area (2 districts in the state of Gujarat) cannot be generalised for the Nation, but further multicentric studies will help in better understanding. The study recruited a good number of informants (833), 13% of them dropped out of the study. Even after recruiting such a huge number, 42(36%) attempted suicides and 26 (30%) suicides had only a single informer, which is not ideal for the validity of the results. This also shows if community surveillance has to be implemented, it will require huge manpower at the community level to support the same. The researchers employed data triangulation by comparing information from hospital records, police records, and data obtained through community surveillance. This approach not only increased the study's validity but also uncovered 55 (63%) suicide cases that had not been documented elsewhere, highlighting the limitations of existing systems.

This approach not only increased the study's validity but also uncovered 55 (63%) suicide cases that had not been documented elsewhere, highlighting the limitations of existing systems. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that a quarter of the hospitals(13 out of 53) in the area did not contribute to the study, potentially impacting the assessment of the incremental advantages of community surveillance over the current system. Additionally, the non-response from the private hospitals emphasizes the potential need for legislative measures, such as an act or law, to mandate data sharing by private institutions if community surveillance and data triangulation are to be effectively implemented. We can also note that Table 3 provides a comprehensive comparison of the ability of community surveillance, hospital records, and police records to obtain additional data on suicide attempts. While the table offers valuable insights into the effectiveness of these data sources, it is important to note the presence of missing values, particularly in the \"Police records\" row. Missing values can impact the validity and interpretability of statistical tests, such as the McNemar's 2 test. The McNemar's test is designed for paired categorical data, comparing the frequency of discordant pairs (those changing from case to non-case or vice versa) between two related samples. However, in cases where data is missing or unavailable for one of the paired variables, the test's assumptions are not met, rendering it inappropriate for analysis. In the \"Police records\" row of Table 3, there are instances where values are missing (e.g., the number of cases and non-cases for police records). As a result, conducting a McNemar's test between \"Community surveillance\" and \"Police records\" would be methodologically unsound due to the absence of complete paired data. This limitation prevents us from making direct statistical comparisons between these two sources using the McNemar's test.To address this limitation, researchers should explore alternative approaches, such as imputing missing values or employing other statistical tests suitable for incomplete or unpaired data. Additionally, the interpretation of results should carefully consider the presence of missing values and potential implications on the overall findings and conclusions. The study gives valuable information about the existence of a data gap in suicides and attempted suicides. This will help researchers to carefully deal with the existing data available on suicides. The article also offers Community surveillance as a potential solution to enhance suicide surveillance and prevention efforts. However, the article falls short in substantiating its feasibility. To address this gap, a multicentric study encompassing India's Cultural and Contextual diversities, evaluating Resources, Infrastructure, Stakeholder Engagement, Scalability, and Sustainability, and comparing the intervention against the gold standard (household survey) is needed. Such an approach will offer a deeper understanding of the viability of community surveillance. I read with interest the article titled 'Inequitable treatment as perceived by international medical graduates (IMGs): a scoping review' by Healey, Fakes and Nair.[1] The authors present their findings on an important issue that affects IMGs worldwide. In the introduction, the authors point out that 1:3 of doctors in the UK are foreign-trained. This proportion is not accurate and stems from confusion about who an IMG is, and how the General Medical Council (GMC) in the UK presents data on IMGs. An IMG is a doctor who practices medicine in a country different to their country of primary medical qualification (PMQ)[2]; a definition which Healey and colleagues agree with and use for their scoping review.[1] The understandable confusion arises when they and other authors quote figures on the proportion of IMGs in the UK and refer to publications from the GMC. The GMC's definition of an 'IMG' is a doctor whose country of PMQ is outside Europe and practices medicine in the UK.[3] The GMC uses this definition for practical reasons as the process of registering for a license to practice in the UK for doctors whose country of PMQ is within Europe is different to doctors whose country of PMQ is outside Europe.[4] The GMC register in August 2023 showed that the proportion of 'IMGs' by the GMC's definition was indeed 32.5% (i.e., 1:3). However, the proportion of doctors whose PMQ was from Europe was 10%. Therefore, the true proportion of IMGs in the UK is 42.5%. Rectif... Rectifying this misrepresentation of the proportion of IMGs in the UK is not merely a pedantic exercise but is important for other reasons. First, the proportion of 42.5% is significantly higher than 32.5% and illustrates the larger scale of the issues faced by IMGs in the UK. Second, the experiences of IMGs are similar whether their country of PMQ is from Europe or outside Europe[2 5], as is the gap in their educational attainment compared to UK graduates which is demonstrated in educational outcome data from the GMC.[6] Finally, if the GMC's definition of 'IMGs' is used in the UK, there is a risk of excluding European graduate IMGs in the UK from interventions that are designed to address the educational gap between them and UK graduates.[7] References: 1.

Dear BMJ Open, Having perused the article titled \"A Protocol for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Investigating the Risk of Sexual Dysfunctions in Breastfeeding Females,\" I found it captivating and of great significance to the general population. The notion behind this study is innovative, as it tackles the concerns of numerous patients who worry about potential sexual disturbances during breastfeeding.

Therefore, I contend that imposing strict eligibility criteria for inclusion in the meta-analyses would be ill-suited for this study, as it is expected to encompass numerous situations with high I2 values. Excluding a significant number of studies from quantitative evidence synthesis would result in missing data, thereby reducing the statistical power of the analyses and potentially introducing bias. Secondly, the article mentions that sensitivity analyses will be performed solely using the leave-one-out method. Considering that this study incorporates prevalence studies and gray literature, where sample sizes often vary and peer-review may be lacking, I propose that the authors expand their investigation into sensitivity by considering the sufficiency of sample sizes and the inclusion of peer-reviewed reports. To conduct a comprehensive sensitivity analysis, I suggest utilizing the tool proposed by Naing et al. (which is also employed in JBI tools) (7). 1. Higgins JP.

Dear sirs, Practically all therapeutic modalities for the treatment of C. difficile enteritis have one thing in common. They are hugely expensive limiting their use even in affluent societies. Alanyl-glutamine is an exciting approach, as it is a relatively simple molecule, and may therefore be cheaper. A very old treatment tool exists however, that has been very rarely studied or used in recent years: bismuth. There is data that it is effective in C. difficile enteritis, has very few negative effects and is dirt cheap. The latter is probably one of the reasons for the lack of motivation for research about it. The use of bismuth salts in treating C. difficile enteritis is something definitely worthy of further study. Besides the 100 plus years of experience with bismuth, no approval or licencing is necessary. Yours sincerely Z. Lengyel MD, PhD. This important study will help helpers help people living with chronic pain.[1] The expert team - including researchers, clinicians, and patients - reminds us that the experience of chronic pain affects many parts of patients' lives. The validity, meaning, and authenticity of their insights are strengthened by their use of the PaCER approach - Patient and Community Engagement Research.[2] Suffering can be more than pain. An even fuller vision of suffering is captured by the Comprehensive Clinical Model of Suffering (CCMS).[3] Both models emphasize the experience of grief, the story of the journey, and the value of acceptance. Patients with chronic pain and suffering deserve help on their journeys with careful assessment, daily coping strategies, and multiple support sources of support. The role of helpers and healers starts with recognition and diagnosis. The patient's healing journey can be supported by witnessing, empathy, and continuity of care.[3,4] Healing can come through finding meaning and editing the narrative of the experience. [5,6] To provide this recognition, assessment, management, and support, we must improve the training of our healing and helping professionals [7], advance research, and improve the models that guide understanding and care.[8] REFERENCES 1.

I wish to correct an apparent misunderstanding about concomitant use of SSRIs and stimulants. I did not state that SSRIs have any indication for treating ADHD, I am aware of research to the contrary and have never used SSRIs to treat ADHD. My statement that \"SSRIs have FDA-indications for treating both conditions\" was intended to refer to the conditions of anxiety and depression; upon re-reading the statement when looking to see how a conclusion was made that I was treating ADHD with SSRIs I can see how it could be mis-construed. Regarding studies of the safety of the combination of stimulants and SSRIs (or other anti-depressants), I also am not aware of any. A prospective study would be challenging to do, to say the least. A retrospective analysis with inclusion of diagnosis-specific information and directly correlating diagnosis, treatment including dosages and duration, and outcomes would probably be challenging as well but I think that degree of detail and specificity is necessary before drawing conclusions about the safety of combinations of medications (drugs) used to treat any condition. Thank you again for your careful consideration of my initial comments. Respectfully, David P.

Thank you for your response to my concerns and comments on the article. I wish to correct an apparent misunderstanding about concomitant use of SSRIs and stimulants.

Thank you again for your careful consideration of my initial comments. Respectfully, David P. Pomeroy MD Regarding my statement that \"stimulants and SSRIs are basically safe\" I was not contesting the fact that each has Black Box warnings and serious side effects and misuse can occur. I do not believe any of either class of medications would have been approved by the FDA if they were not reasonably safe. The warnings are certainly appropriate, addiction, abuse and suicide are serious conditions and situations. Suicidal ideation related to use of SSRIs is possible but of low incidence; one analysis determined that the Number Needed to Treat (with benefit) for SSRIs was 3 , the Number Needed to Harm (any significant side effect) was 254. The number of completed suicides actually increased when prescribing of SSRIs decreased immediately after the Black Box warning was issued. I recognize the abuse potential and misuse of all stimulants, particularly in the college-attending population. I do believe, however, that a person with accurately diagnosed and appropriately treated ADHD is unlikely to become addicted to CII stimulants because of one fact : when patients take a higher dosage of stimulant than necessary for optimal benefit to their ADHD-related impairments, they feel worse. They have adverse reactions, symptoms which are intolerable, so there is no incentive for them to take higher and higher amounts. They do not experience the euphoria which those who do not have ADHD apparently experience and to which they quickly develop tolerance and take higher amounts, chasing the \"high\". I did not mean to question any of the co-authors with respect to their clinical acumen or status and I apologize for any insult taken. I should have considered the wording of my concerns more carefully before publishing them, thank you for bringing my attention to that. I admit I do not know the clinical experience of many physicians in treating ADHD, those that I do have had experiences similar to mine detailed above. "}
