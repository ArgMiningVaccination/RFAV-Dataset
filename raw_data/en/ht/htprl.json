Vol. 15-9Preface The Idaho Administrative Bulletin is an electronic-only, online monthly publication of the Office of the Administrative Rules Coordinator, Department of Administ ration, that is published pursuant to Section 67-5203, Idaho Code. The Bulletin is a compilation of all official rule making notices, official rule text, executive orders of the Governor, and all legislative documents aff ecting rules that are statutorily required to be published in the Bulletin. It may also include other rules-related documents an agency may want to make public through the Bulletin. State agencies are required to provide public notice of all ru lemaking actions and must invite public input. This is done through negotiated rulemaking procedures or after prop osed rulemaking has been initiated. The public receives notice that an agency has initiated proposed rulemaking procedures through the Idaho Administrative Bulletin and a legal notice (Public Notice of Intent) that publishes in authorized newspapers throughout the state. The legal notice provides reasonable opportunity for the public to participate when a proposed rule publishes in the Bulletin. Interested parties may submit written comments to the agency or request public hearings of the agency, if none have been scheduled. Such submissions or requests must be pres ented to the agency within the time and manner specified in the individual \"Notice of Rulemaking - Proposed Rule\" fo r each proposed rule that is published in the Bulletin. Once the comment period closes, the ag ency considers fully all comments and information submitted regarding the proposed rule. Changes may be made to the proposed ru le at this stage of the rulemaking, but changes must be based on comments received and must be a \"logical outgrowt h\" of the proposed rule. The agency may now adopt and publish the pending rule. A pending rule is \"pending\" legislative review for final approval. The pending rule is the agency's final version of the rulemaking that will be fo rwarded to the legislature for review and final approval. Comment periods and public hearings are not provided for when the agency adopts a temporary or pending rule. CITATION TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The Bulletin is identified by the calendar y ear and issue number. For example, Bulletin 13-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2013; Bulletin 14-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2014. Volume numbers, which proceed from 1 to 12 in a given year, correspond to the months of publication, i.e.; Volume No. 13-1 refers to January 2013; Volume No. 13-2 refers to February 2013; and so forth. Example: The Bulletin published in January 2014 is cited as Volume 14-1. The August 2015 Bulletin is cited as Volume 15-8. RELATIONSHIP TO THE I DAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE The Idaho Administrative Code is an electronic-only, online comp ilation of all final and enforceable administrative rules of the state of Idaho that are of full force and effect. Any temporary rule that is adopted by an agency and is of force and effect is codified into the Ad ministrative Code upon becoming effective. All pending rules that have been approved by the legislature during the legisla tive session as final rules and any temporary rules that are extended supplement the Administrative Code. These rules are codified into the Administ rative Code upon becoming effective. Because proposed and pending rules are not enfo rceable, they are published in the Administrative Bulletin only and cannot be codified into the Admi nistrative Code until approved as final. To determine if a particular rule remains in effect or whether any amendments have been made to the rule, refer to the Cumulative Rulemaking Index. Link to it on the Administrative Rules homepage at adminrules.idaho.gov . THE DIFFERENT RULES PUBLISHED IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Idaho's administrative rulemaking process, governed by th e Administrative Procedure Act, Title 67, Chapter 52, Idaho Code, comprises distinct rulemaking actions: negotiated, proposed, temporary, pending and final rulemaking. Not all rulemakings incorporate or require all of these actions. At a minimum, a rulemaking includes proposed, pending and final rulemaking. Many rules are adopted as temporary rules when they meet the required statutory criteria and agencies must, when feasible, engage in negotiated rulemaking at the beginning of the process to facilitate consensus building. In the majority of cases, the process begins with proposed rulemaking and ends with the final rulemaking. The following is a brie f explanation of each type of rule. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING Negotiated rulemaking is a process in which all interested persons and the agency seek consensus on the content of a rule through dialogue. Agencies ar e required to conduct negotiated rulemaking whenever it is feasible to do so. IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 8 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9The agency files a \"Notice of Intent to Promulgate - Negotiated Rulemaking\" for publication in the Administrative Bulletin inviting interested persons to contact the agency if interested in discussing the agency's intentions regarding the rule changes. This process is intended to result in the formulation of a proposed rule and the initiation of regular rulemaking procedures. One result, however, may also be that regular (proposed) rulemaking is not initiated and no further action is taken by the agency. PROPOSED RULEMAKING A proposed rulemaking is an action by an agency wherein the agency is proposing to am end or repeal an existing rule or to adopt a new rule. Prior to th e adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule, the agency must publish a \"Notice of Rulemaking - Proposed Rule\" in the Bulletin. This notice must include: a) the specific statutory authority (from Idaho Code) for the rulemaking including a citation to a specific federal statute or regulation if that is the basis of authority for or is occasioning the rulemaking; b) a statement in nontechnical language of the subs tance of the proposed rule, including a specific description of any fee or charge imposed or increased; c) a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fi scal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year when the pending rule will become effective; provided, however, that notwithstanding Sec tion 67-5231, Idaho Code, the absence or accuracy of a fiscal impact statement provided pursuant to this subsection shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the rule. d) if any document is incorporated by reference in the proposed rule, a brief written synopsis of why the incorporation is needed must be in cluded in the notice of proposed ru lemaking, along with a link to the electronic version of the incorporated material or information on how it can be obtained. e) the text of the proposed rule prepared in legislative format; f) the location, date, and time of any public hearings the agency intends to hold on the proposed rule; g) the manner in which persons may make written comments on the proposed rule, including the name and address of a person in the agency to wh om comments on the proposal may be sent; h) the manner in which persons may request an opportunity for an oral presentation as provided in Section 67-5222, Idaho Code; and i) the deadline for public (written) comments on the proposed rule. Any proposed rulemaking that is submitted for publication in the Bulletin that would impose a fee or charge must be accompanied by a cost/benefit analysis th at is prepared by the agency. This cost/benefit analysis must estimate, as reasonably as possible, the costs to th e agency to implemen t the rule and the estimated co sts that would be borne by citizens or the private sector. This analys is is filed with the Director of Legisl ative Services Office who then forwards it to the appropriate germane joint subcommittee assigned to review the promulgating agency's proposed rules. When incorporating by reference, the notice of proposed rulemaking must include a brief synopsis detailing the need to incorporate by reference any additional materials into the rule. The agency must also provide information regarding access to the incorporated materials. At a mini mum, and when available, th e agency must provide an electronic link to the documents that can accessed on a web s ite or post this information on its own web site, or both. This link can be placed into the ru le and activated once it is posted on the Coordinator's web site. As stated, the text of the proposed rule must be published in the Bulletin. After meeting the statutory rulemaking criteria for a proposed rule, the agency may adopt the pend ing rule. Because a proposed rule is not enforceable, it has no effective date, even when published in conjunction with a temporary rule that is of fu ll force and effect. An agency may vacate (terminate) a rulemaking after th e publication of a proposed rule if it decides, for whatever reason, not to proceed further to finalize the rulemaking. The publication of a \"Notice of Vacation of Proposed Rulemaking\" in the Bulletin officially stops the formal rulemaking process.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 9 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9TEMPORARY RULEMAKING Temporary rules may be adopted only when the governor finds that it is necessary for: a) protection of the public health, safety, or welfare; or b) compliance with deadlines in amendments to governing law or federal programs; orc) conferring a benefit. If a rulemaking meets one or more of the above legal criteri a and the governor determines that it is necessary that a rule become effective prior to receivi ng legislative authorization and without allowing for any public input, the agency may proceed and adopt a temporary rule. The law allows an agency to make a temporary rule immediately effective upon adoption. However, a temporary rule that impo ses a fee or charge may be adopted only if the governor finds that the fee or charge is necessary to avoid immediate danger which justifies the imposition of the fee or charge. A temporary rule expires at the conclusion of the next succeeding regular legislative session unless the rule is extended by concurrent resolution, is replaced by a final rule, or expires under its own terms. The statute that regulates rulemaking in Idaho requires that the text of all proposed rulemakings publish in the Bulletin in order for the rulemaking to be valid. This is true for all temporary rules as well. In most cases, the agency wants the temporary rule to also become a final rule and in most of these cases, the temporary rule and the proposed rule text is identical. In this event, both rulemakings may be promulgated concurrently, however, they remain separate rulemaking actions. The rulemaking is published in the Bulletin as a temporary/proposed rule. Combining the rulemaking allows for a single publication of the text in the Bulletin. An agency may, at any time, rescind a temporary rule that has been adopted and is in effect. The agency must publish a notice of rescission to effectively rescind the temporary rule. If the temporary rule is being replaced by a new temporary rule or if it has been published concurrently with a proposed rule that is being vacated, the agency, in most instances, will rescind the temporary rule. PENDING RULEMAKING A pending rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under regular rulemaking procedures and remains subject to legislative review before it becomes a final, enforceable rule. When a pending rule is published in the Bulletin, the agency is required to include certain information in the \"Notice of Rulemaking - Pending Rule.\" This includes: a) a statement giving the reasons for adopting the rule; b) a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for any changes; c) the date the pending rule will become final and effective and a statement that the pending rule may be rejected, amended or modified by co ncurrent resolution of the legislature; d) an identification of any portion of the rule impo sing or increasing a fee or charge and a statement that this portion of the rule shall not become fi nal and effective unless affirmatively approved by concurrent resolution of the legislature; (e) the specific statutory authority for the rulemaking including a citation to the specific section of the Idaho Code that has occasioned the rulemaking, or the federal statute or regulation if that is the basis of authority or requirement for the rulemaking; and (f) a specific description, if applicable, of any nega tive fiscal impact on the state general fund greater IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 10 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year when the pending rule will become effective; provided however, that notwithstanding section 67-5231, Idaho Code, the absence or accuracy of a fiscal impact statement provided pursuant to this subsection shall not affect the validity or the enforceability of the rule. Agencies are required to republish the text of the pendi ng rule when substantive chan ges have been made to the proposed rule. An agency may adopt a pending rule that varies in content from that which was originally proposed if the subject matter of the rule remains the same, the pending rule change is a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule, and the original notice was written so as to assure that me mbers of the public were reasonably notified of the subject. It is not always necessary to republish all the text of the pending rule. With the permission of the Rules Coordinator, only the sections or their subparts that have changed from the proposed text are republished. If no changes have been made to the previously published text, it is not required to republish the text again and only the \"Notice of Rulemaking - Adoption of Pending Rule\" is published. FINAL RULEMAKING A final rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under the regular rulemaking procedures and is of full force and effect. No pending rule adopted by an agency becomes final and effective until it has been submitted to the legislature for review and approval. Where the legislature finds that an agency has violated the legislative intent of the authorizing statute, a concurrent resolution may be adopted to reject the rulemaking in whole or in part. A \"Notice of Rulemaking - Final Rule\" and the final codified text must be published in the Bulletin for any rule that is partially rejected by concurrent resolution of the legislature. Unless rejected by concurrent resolution, a pending rule that is reviewed by the legislature becomes final and effective at th e end of the session in which it is reviewed without any further legislative action. All pending rules that are approv ed by concurrent resolution become final and effective upon adoption of the concurrent resolution unless otherwise stated. In no event can a pending rule become final and effective before the conclusion of the regular or special legislative session at which the rule was submitted for review. However, a rule that is final and effective may be applied retroactively, as provided in the rule.

Each state agency ha s a two-digit identification code number known as the \"IDAPA\" number. (The \"IDAPA\" Codes are listed in the alphab etical/numerical index at the end of this Preface.) Within each agency there are divisions or departments to which a two-digit \"TITLE\" number is assigned. There are \"CHAPTER\" numbers assigned within the Title and the rule text is divided among major sections that are further subdivided into subsections. An example IDAPA number is as follows: IDAPA 38.05.01.200.02.c.ii. \"IDAPA\" refers to Administrative Rules in general that are subject to the Administrative Procedures Act and are required by this act to be published in the Idaho Administrative Code and the Idaho Administrative Bulletin. \"38.\" refers to the Idaho Department of Administration \"05.\" refers to Title 05, which is the Department of Administrations's Division of Purchasing \"01.\" refers to Chapter 01 of Title 05, \"Rules of the Division of Purchasing\" \"200.\" refers to Major Section 200 , \"Content of the Invitation to Bid\" \"02.\" refers to 200. 02. \"c.\" 200.02. c. \"ii.\" refers to Subsection 200.02.c. ii. DOCKET NUMBERING SYSTEM Internally, the Bulletin is organized sequentially using a rule docketing system. Each rulemaking that is filed with the Coordinator is assigned a \"DOCKET NUMBER.\" The docket number is a series of by a hyphen two-digit agency code) in the Bulletin. The fo llowing example is a breakdown of a typical rule docket \"DOCKET NO. 38-0501-1401\" \"38-\" denotes the agency's this case the Department of Administration. \"0501-\" refers to the TITLE AND CHAPTER numbers of the agency rule bein g promulgated; in this case the Division of Purchasing (TITLE 05), Rules of the Division of Purchasing (Chapter 01 ). \"1401\" denotes the year and sequential order of the docket being published; in this case the numbers refer to the first rulemaking action published in calendar year 2014. A subsequent rulemaking on this same rule chapter in calendar year 2014 would be designated as \" 1402\". The docket number in this scenario would be 38-0501- 1402. Within each Docket, only the affected sections of chapters are printed. (See Sections Affected Index in each Bulletin for a listing of these.)

Currently, the Department collects a fee from alcohol and substance use diso rders treatment and recovery support facilities that is $100 per facility for treatment and $50 per facility for recovery support services.

The action is authorized pursuant to Sections 41-211, 41-401, 41-1006(2), 41-4005(4), 41-4011(4), 41-5806(1)(g), HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than September 16, 2015. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with di sabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below.DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: Title 41, Chapter 40, was amended in 2013 to provide that post-secondary educational institutions could provide students self-funded health care plans in Idaho. Previously, registration of such plans was limited to employee plans. The rulemaking will seek to clarify the language that the registration fee is paid by all self-funded plans registering with the department. Title 41, Chapter 58, Idaho Code, permits the department to license public adjusters. The proposed rule provides that public adjusters pay the same licensing an d examination fees as producers and adjusters. The department contracts with a private contractor to administer insurance pr oducer, adjuster and public adjuster examinations. The examination fee is cu rrently established per rule at $60. The rulemaking will revise language concerning the amount paid by an applicant for licensu re as a producer, adjuster and public adjuster for an examination to a third party testing vendor. The statutory provision for a solicitation permit application and fee (former Idaho Code \u00a7 41-2807) was repealed by the Idaho Legislature in 2003, so the reference to a fee in department rule should be removed. Technical corrections are also made. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: The proposed rulemaking will: Amend 18.01.44.020.03 to clarify that registration of self-funded student health plans is subject to the licensing/renewal $500 fee just like self-f unded employer plans by removing the specific reference to \"employee\" plans; Amend IDAPA 18.01.44.030 to add a licensing/renewal fee for public adjusters of $80; Amend IDAPA 18.01.44.030 to change the provision regarding the cost paid to a third party vendor by an applicant for a producer, public adjuster, or adjuster license to take an examination by eliminating the $60 fee referenced and provide that the applicant will pay an amount to the vendor as provided for by contract between the department and testing vendor; Eliminate fees for solicitation permits in section 18.01.040, as related code sections have been repealed; and Make technical corrections in section 18.01.0 40 to update terminology and include catchall language regarding service of process fees, and eliminate unnecessary language in 18.01.020.04. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if app licable, of any negative fi scal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year resulting from this rulemaking: The fiscal impact of the changes is expected to be revenue neutral.IDAHO DEPARTMENT OF INS URANCE Docket No. 18-0144-1501 Schedule of Fees, Licenses, & Miscellaneous Charges Proposed Fee Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 208 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(1), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemaking was conducted.

The action is authorized pursuant to Sections 41-211, 41-4608, and 56- 1305, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than September 16, 2015. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with di sabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below.DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The long-term care rule (IDAPA 18.01.60.017) currently references inflation protection but does not clearly establish a minimum amount applicable to long-term care pa rtnership policies. Qualifying long-term care partnership policies allow consumers who buy them to qualify for Medicaid asset disregard as provided for in Title 56, Chapter 13, Idaho Code. For long-term care partnership policies, the Department has required a minimum 5% compound inflation protection for policyholders less than 61 and 5% simple inflation for those age 61 to 75 or, alternatively, benefit guarantees of not less than the annual change in the Consumer Price In dex pursuant to Bulletin 06-07. If and when the proposed rule becomes effective, the Department intends to rescind Bulletin 06-7. The rule will clarify annual inflation protection requirements applicable to long term care partnership policies, but will not require any minimum level of inflation protection. The Department expects that this may promote more purchases of such policies. The rulemaking will also revise how documents ar e incorporated by using the standard rulemaking format. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: None. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if app licable, of any negative fi scal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year resulting from this rulemaking: NA NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(1), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemaking was conducted.

Box 36 Boise, ID 83722-0410(208) 334-7670IDAHO STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0101-1501 Income Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 246 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9THE FOLLOWING IS THE PROPOSED TEXT OF DOCKET NO. 35-0101-1501 (Only Those Sections With Amendments Are Shown.) 016.IDAHO GROSS INCOME. Sections 63-3011 and 63-3030, Idaho Code 01.In General . Gross income means all income from what ever source derived, unless specifically excluded by the Internal Revenue Code. ( ) 02.Gross Income from Pass-Through Entities . Gross income includes an owner's share of a pass- through entity's gross income pursuant to sections 702(c) and 1366(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, and federal Treasury Regulation Section 1.61-13 (citing Part I, Subchapter J, Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code). ( ) 03.Gross Income from Idaho Sources . Gross income from Idaho sources is that portion of total gross income derived from or related to sources within Idaho. Income derived from or related to sources within Idaho is determined pursuant to this rule and Rules 260 through 286 of these rules. ( ) 04.Idaho Source Gross Income from a Pass-Through ( ) a.Partnership. The amount of sources is: ( ) i.The partner's distributive share of partnership gross income included in the partnership's apportionable income multiplied by the Idaho ap portionment the partnership; and ( ) ii.The partner's allocated to Idaho. ( ) b.S Corporation. The amount of a shareholde r's income from Idaho sources is: ( ) i.The shareholder's pro rata share of the S corpora tion gross income included in the S corporation's apportionable income multiplied by the Idaho ap portionment factor of the S corporation; and ( ) ii.The shareholder's pro rata share of gross income allocated to Idaho. ( ) c.Trust or Estate. The Idaho source portion of the income that constitutes gross income pursuant to federal Treasury Regulation Section 1.61-13 and Part I, Subchapter J, Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code, is the amount of such income that would be Idaho source if received directly by the individual. ( ) 05.Examples . ( ) a.A income includes ten thousand dollars ($10,000) of ordinary loss passed through from a partnership that transacts business only in Idaho. However, the taxpayer's distributive share of the partnership's gross income determined under Section 61 of the Internal Revenue Code is fifty thousand dollars ($50,000). The taxpayer's gross income from Idaho sources from the partnership is fifty thousand dollars ($50,000). ( ) b.A taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income includes ten thousand dollars ($10,000) of ordinary loss passed through from a partnership that has a fifty percent (50%) Idaho apportionment factor. However, the taxpayer's distributive share of the partnership's gross income determined under Section 61 of the Internal Revenue Code is fifty thousand dollars ($50,000). The taxpayer's gross income from Idaho sources from the partnership is twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000). ( ) c.A nonresident taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income includes five thousand dollars ($5,000) of guaranteed payments for services performed outside of Id aho received from a partnershi p that has a fifty percent IDAHO STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0101-1501 Income Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 247 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9(50%) Idaho apportionment factor. As provided in Section 63-3026A(3)(a)(i)(2), Idaho Code, none of the guaranteed payments are included in the partner's gross income from Idaho sources because the services were performed outside of Idaho. ( ) d.A nonresident taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income includes five thousand dollars ($5,000) of guaranteed payments for services performed in Idaho received from a partnership that has a fifty percent (50%) Idaho apportionment factor. As provided in Section 63-3026A(3)( a)(i)(2), Idaho Code, all of the guaranteed payments are included in the partner's gross income from Idaho s ources because the services were performed in Idaho. ( ) e.A nonresident taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income includes three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) of guaranteed payments for services performe d outside of Idaho received fr om a partnership that has a fifty percent (50%) Idaho apportionment factor. As provided in Section 63-3026A(3)(a)(i)(2), Idaho Code, the first two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) of guaranteed payments are sourced as compensation for services. Since the services were performed outside of Idaho, two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) of the guaranteed payments are not included in the partner's gross income from Idaho s ources. However, twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) of the guaranteed payments in excess of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) are included in the partner's gross income from Idaho sources based on the apportionment factor of the partnership. ( ) f.A nonresident taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income includes ten thousand dollars ($10,000) of nonbusiness gross income passed through from a partnership that has a fifty percent (50%) Idaho apportionment factor. If the partnership's nonbusiness income is allocated to Idaho, ten thousand dollars ($10,000) of the nonbusiness gross income is included in the partner's gross income from Idaho sources. If the partnership's nonbusiness income is allocated to a state other than Idah o, none of the nonbusiness gross income is included in the partner's gross income from Idaho sources. ( ) 0167. -- 024. (RESERVED) (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS) 171. IDAHO CAPITAL GAINS DEDUCTION -- QUALIFIED PROPERTY (RULE 171). Section 63-3022H, Idaho Code. 01. Tangible Personal Property . Tangible personal property qualifies for the Idaho capital gains deduction if it was used in Idaho for at least twelve (12) months by a revenue-producing enterprise as defined by Section 63-3022H(4), Idaho Code, and Rule 172 of these rules. (4-7-11) 02. Real Property . Idaho real property qualifies for the Idaho capital gains deduction if it was held by the taxpayer for twelve (12) months. Section 63-3022H(5), Idaho Code, defines real property to be land and other tangible property permanently upon or affixed to the land. For purposes of the Idaho capital gains deduction, real property does not include intangible property or severable property rights. See Subsection 171.05 of this rule for examples of nonqualifying property. (4-4-13)( ) 03. Gain from Forfeited Rights and Payments . Gain attributable to a cancellation, lapse, expiration, or other termination of a contract right or obligation does not qualify for the Idaho capital gains deduction. This includes any gain from the lapse of an option or from forfeited earnest money, down payment, or similar payments, related to otherwise qualifying property. (4-7-11) 04. Timber . As used in Section 63-3022H(3)(e), Idaho Code, qualified timber grown in Idaho includes: (3-20-97) a.Standing timber held as investment property that is a capital asset pursuant to Section 1221, Internal Revenue Code; and (3-20-97) b.Cut timber if the taxpayer elects to treat the cuttin g of timber as a sale or exchange pursuant to IDAHO STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0101-1501 Income Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 248 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9Section 631(a), Internal Revenue includes: (4-4-13) property not having an Idaho situs. (4-4-13) b.Tangible personal property not used by a revenue-producing enterprise. (4-4-13) c.Intangible property. Some examples of intangible property include, but are not limited to: (4-4-13) i. Stocks and bonds; (4-4-13) ii.Easements and rights of way, including open-space easements; vi.Water, mineral, hunting and (4-4-13) vii.Conservation easements; (4-4-13) viii.Scenic easements; (4-4-13) S corporation. (4-4-13) 06. Holding Periods . (3-20-97) a.In General. To qualify for the capital gains deduction, property otherwise eligible for the Idaho capital gains deduction must be held for specific time periods. The holding periods for Idaho purposes generally follow Sections 1223 and 735, Internal Revenue Code. (5-8-09) b.Exception to the Tacked-On Holding Period. The holding period of property given up in a tax-free exchange is not tacked on to the hold ing period of the property received if the property given up was nonqualifying property based on the requirements of Section 63-3022H(3), Idaho Code. (4-4-13) c.Installment Sales. The determination of whether th e property meets the required holding period is made using the laws applicable for the year of the sale. If the required holding period is not met in the year of sale, the gain is not from qualified property. The classification as nonqualified property will not change even though the gain may be reported in subsequent years when a reduced holding period is applicable. (4-5-00) d.Examples of nonqualifying property. (7-1-98) i. A taxpayer purchased land in California. After owning the land three (3) years, he gave up the California land in a tax-free exchange for land in Idaho. He owned the Idaho land for ten (10) months until selling it at a gain. For federal purposes the holding period of the California land tacks on to the holding period of the Idaho land. The gain from the sale of the California land would not qualify for the Idaho capital gains deduction since it is real property located outside Idaho. The holding period of the California land does not tack on to the holding period of the Idaho land for purposes of the Idaho capital gains de duction. Because the Idaho land was not held for twelve (12) months, the gain from the sale of the Idaho land does not qualify for the Idaho capital gains deduction.(3-30-07) ii. Assume the same facts as in th e example in Subparagraph 171.05.d .i. except the taxp ayer's original purchase was land in Idaho. Because the taxpayer owned real property in Idaho that was exchanged for a second IDAHO STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0101-1501 Income Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 249 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9parcel of real property in Idaho, the holding period of the Idaho land given up tacks on to the holding period of the second parcel of Idaho land. Because the holding period of the second property, which includes the holding period of the first property, was at least twelve (12) months, the ga in from the sale of the second parcel of real property qualifies for the Idaho capital gains deduction. (4-7-11) 07. Holding Periods of S Corpor ation and Partnership Property . (7-1-98) a.Property Contributed by a Shareholder to an S Corporation or by a Partner to a Partnership. A shareholder or partner who contributes otherwise qualified property to an S corporation or partnership may treat the pass-through gain on the sale of that property as a qualifying Idaho capital gain if the property has, in total, been held by the shareholder or partner and the S corporation or partnership for the required holding period. The noncontributing shareholders or partners may treat the pass-through gain as a qualifying Idaho capital gain only if the S corporation or partnership held the property for the required holding period. (5-8-09) b.Property Distributed by an S Corporation or Partnership. (2-27-12) i.Liquidating Distributions. For purposes of this ru le, the holding period of property received in a distribution from a partnership in liquidation of a partnership interest or from an S corporation in liquidation of stock does not include the time the partnership or S corpora tion held the property. In such cases, the property is received in exchange for the interest in the entity. Since a partnership interest and stock are not qualified property for purposes of the Idaho capital gains deduction, the entity's holding period does not tack on to the holding period of the property received in liquidation. (2-27-12) ii.Nonliquidating Distributions. For purposes of this rule, th e holding period of property received in a distribution from a partnership other than in liquidation of a partnership interest or from an S corporation other than in liquidation of stock includes the time the entity held the property. (2-27-12) ( ) (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS) 291. TAX PAID BY PASS-THROUGH ENTITIES FOR OWNERS OR BENEFICIARIES -- COMPUTATION OF IDAHO TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXABLE YEARS BEGINNING ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 201 24 (RULE 291). Sections 63-3022L and 63-3026A, Idaho Code. 01. In General . A pass-through entity is responsible for reporting and paying the tax for nonresident individuals or withholding tax on the individual's share of income from the pass-through entity required to be included in Idaho taxable in come as prescribed in Section 63-3036B, Idaho Code. For purposes of this rule, pass- through entity means \"pass-through entity\" as defined in Section 63-3006C, Idaho Code. (4-4-13) 02. Income Reportable to Idaho . The following items must be includ ed in the computation of Idaho taxable income for an individual: (4-4-13) a.Pass-through items that are income from Idaho sources of an owner as determined pursuant to Rule 263 of these rules. (4-7-11) b.Distributable net income from an estate or trust that is income from Idaho sources as determined pursuant to Rule 261 of these rules. (4-7-11) 03. Deductions . Pass-through entities paying the tax under Section 63-3022L, Idaho Code, are not entitled to claim the following deductions on behalf of an individual. (4-7-11) a.Capital Loss. As provided in Section 63-3022(i), Idaho Code, S corporations and partnerships are not allowed to carry over or carry back any capital loss provided for in Section 1212, Internal Revenue Code. (3-30-07)IDAHO STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0101-1501 Income Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 250 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9b.Net Operating Loss. As provided in Section 63-3022(i), Idaho Code, S corporations and partnerships are not allowed to carry over or carry back any net operating loss provided for in Section 63-3022(c), Idaho Code. (3-30-07) c.Idaho Capital Gains Deduction.

Amounts provided to owners of pass-through entities and beneficiaries of trusts and estates on the federal Schedule K-1 that are informational only may not be used as a deduction in computing the taxable income reportable under Section 63-3022L, Idaho Code. Informational items include the domestic production activities information and net earnings from self-employment. (4-7-11) e.Items Not Deductible Under the Internal Revenue Code. A deduction is not allowed for items disallowed under the Internal Revenue Code. For example, a deduction is not allowed for items disallowed as a deduction in Sections 162(c) and 262 through 280E, Inte rnal Revenue Code, unless specifically allowed by Idaho law. Items allowed by Idaho law include expenses related to tax-exempt income under Section 265, Internal Revenue Code, which are allowed to be deducted as a result of Section 63-3022M, Idaho Code. (4-7-11) f.Items Not Reported as a Pass-Through Deduction. Amounts not reported from the pass-through entity to the pass-through owner are not allowed as a deduction under Section 63-3022L, Idaho Code. These include: (4-7-11) i. The standard deduction; (4-7-11) ii. Personal exemptions; (4-7-11) iii. Itemized deductions that result from activity of the pass-through owner. For example, a deduction is not allowed for charitable contributions made personally by the pass-through owner, but is allowed for the pass-through owner's share of charitable contributions made by the pass-through entity. (4-7-11) g. Items Reported as a Pass-Through Deduction. Amounts reported from the pass-through entity to the pass-through owner in their distributive share are allowed as a deduction under Section 63-3022L, Idaho Code, unless otherwise disallowed under this rule. These include but are not limited to: ( ) i.Section ( ) 04. Double Deductions Disallowed .

Rule 130 is being amended consistent with 2015 HB36 to add the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System and its offset program to the list of qualified benefits for the Retirement Benefits Deduction. It also adds the offset program of the Civil Service Retirement System to the list of qualified benefits. Rule 173 is being amended consistent with 2015 HB133 to change who must meet the gross income limitations for the Idaho capital gains deduction when the gain is passed through from an S corporation, partnership, trust, or estate. Rule 201 is being amended to clarify the procedure for adjustments to a net operating loss. Rule 252 is being amended to remedy the distortive percentage that occurs when the ratio of Idaho total income is used to allow certain deductions to part-year or nonresid ents. The distortive percentage occurs when a part-year or nonresident has a federal NOL carryover that wipes out income for federal purposes. Rule 263 is being amended to update the amount of guar anteed payments that is sourced as compensation for services per Section 63-3026A(3)(a)(i)(2), Idaho Code. Rule 771 is being amended to add tax year 2015 and the applicable grocery credit amounts to the table.

TAX ON INDIVIDUALS, ESTATES, AND TRUSTS (RULE 075). Section 63-3024, Idaho Code. 01. In General. The tax rates applied to the Idaho taxable income of an individual, trust or estate for the latest five (5) years are identified in Subsection 075.03 of this rule. The Idaho income tax brackets are adjusted for inflation. The maximum tax rate as listed for the applicable taxable year in Subsection 075.03 of this rule applies in computing the tax attributable to the S corporation stock held by an electing small business trust.

DEDUCTION OF CERTAIN RETIREMENT BENEFITS (RULE 130). Section 63-3022A, Idaho Code. 01. Qualified Benefits . Subject to limitations, the following benefits qualify for the deduction: (3-20-97) a.Retirement annuities paid to a retired civil service employee. For purposes of this deduction a retired civil service employee is an individual who is receiving retirement annuities paid under the Civil Service Retirement System by the United States Government , the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System, or the offset programs of these systems . An individual is entitled to benefits from this retirement system only if he established eligibility prior to 1984. Retirement annuities paid to a retired federal employee under the Federal Employees Retirement System generally do not qualify fo r the deduction. Retirement annuities received under the Federal Employees Retirement System by a retiree previous ly covered under the Civil Service Retirement System qualify to the extent the retiree establishes the portion of the annuity attributable to coverage under the Civil Service Retirement System. (4-4-13) ( ) b.Retirement benefits paid as a result of participating in the firemen's retirement fund of the state of Idaho as authorized by Title 72, Chapter 14, Idaho Code. A fireman is entitled to benefits from this fund only if he established eligibility as a paid fireman prior to October 1, 1980. Retirement benefits paid by out of the public employee's retirement system do not qualify for the deduction. (3-20-97) ( ) c.Retirement benefits paid to a retired Idaho city police officer: (4-4-13) i. By a city or its agent in regard to a policeman's retirement fund that no longer admits new members and on January 1, 2012, was administered by a city in this state; or (4-4-13) ii. In regard to a policeman's retirement fund that no longer admits new members and on January 1, 2012, was administered by the public employ ee retirement system of Idaho; or (4-4-13) iii. By the public employee retirement system of Idaho to a retired police officer in regard to Idaho employment not included in the federal soci al security retirement system; or (4-4-13) iv. An unremarried widow or widower of a person described in Subparagraph 130.01.c.i., 130.01.c.ii., or 130.01.c.iii. of this rule. (4-4-13) d.Retirement benefits paid by the United States Government to a retired member of the military services. (3-20-97)$4,356 $5,808 $135.03 + 5.1% + of $10,890 or more $555.38 + 7.4% of the amount over $10,890 Tax and bracket amounts were calculated using consumer price index amounts published on April 13, 2014.IF IDAHO TAXABLE INCOME IS IDAHO TAX At least But less than Is PlusIDAHO STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0101-1502 Income Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 256 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-902. Unremarried Widow or Widower . An unremarried widow or widower of a retired civil service employee, retired policeman, retired fireman, or retired member of the military services, who is sixty-five (65) or older, or sixty-two (62) and disabled, is eligible for the deduction, even though the deceas ed spouse was not eligible at the time of death. In this situation, the amount of th e retirement benefits that can be considered for the deduction for the taxable year of the spouse's death is limited to the benefits paid to the spouse as a widow or widower. (4-4-13) a.Example. In year one (1), the husband of a marrie d couple filing a joint income tax return received civil service retirement. The husband did not qualify for th e Idaho retirement deduction that year since he was not disabled and was only age sixty (60) during that year. In year two (2) the husband died. Because his wife is age sixty- three (63) and disabled in that year, she is eligible for the deduction for year two (2) but only for the amount of her husband's retirement benefits she received that year as a result of being the widow. She may not include in the computation of the deduction any amounts her husband was paid or entitled to prior to his death. For year three (3), she may compute the deduction based on all the retirement benefits she receives as the widow that year. (4-6-05) b.Example. Assume the same facts as stated in Paragr aph 130.02.a, of this rule, except that the wife is not disabled and does not reach age sixty-five (65) until year four (4). In year one (1) the husband did not qualify for the Idaho retirement deduction. In year two (2) the husband did not qualify for the deduction and the wife did not qualify after her husband died. In year three (3), the wife di d not qualify. In year four (4), because the wife reaches age sixty-five (65) during that year, she is entitled to the Idaho retirement deduction on the amount of her husband's retirement she received that year as a result of being a widow. (4-6-05) c.Example. Once the widow remarries, she will not be eligible for the Idaho retirement deduction for that year and the years that follow on the amounts she receives from her previous husband's retirement. (4-6-05) 03. Married Individuals Filing Separate Returns . Married individuals who elect to file married filing separate are not entitled to the deduction allowed by Section 63-3022A, Idaho Code. (7-1-98) 04. Publication of Maximum Deduction . The maximum deduction that may be subtracted when computing Idaho taxable income will be published each year in the instructions for preparing Idaho individual income tax returns. (4-4-13) 05. Disabled Individual . For purposes of this deduction, an individual is classified as disabled if he meets the requirements of Section 63-701, Idaho Code, or an individual who qualifies as a person with a \"permanent disability\" under Section 49-117 (7) (b) (iv), Idaho Code. This includes: (4-4-13) a.An individual recognized as disabled by the Soci al Security Administration pursuant to Title 42, United States Code, or by the Railroad Retirement Board pursua nt to Title 45, United States Code, or by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to Title 5, United States Code; or (4-6-05) b.A disabled veteran of any war engaged in by the United States, whose disability is recognized as a service-connected disability of a degree of ten percent (10%) or more, or who has a pension for nonservice-connected disabilities, in accordance with laws and regulations administered by the United States Veterans Administration. (4-6-05) (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS) 173. IDAHO CAPITAL GAINS DEDUCTION -- PASS-THROUGH ENTITIES (RULE 173). Section 63-3022H, Idaho Code. 01. In General . (3-20-97) a.Qualified property held by an S corporation, partnership, trust, or estate may be eligible for the Idaho capital gains deduction. The deduction is allowed only on the return of an individual shareholder, individual partner, or individual beneficiary. (3-29-10)IDAHO STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0101-1502 Income Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 257 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9b.Partnerships, S corporations, trusts, and estates that pay the tax for an electing individual pursuant to Section 63-3022L, Idaho Code, are not allowe d to claim a capital gains deduction. (3-29-10) 02.Gross Income Limitations . To qualify for the Idaho capital gains deduction on the pass-through gain from qualified property of an S corporation, partnership, trust, or estate, a shareholder, partner, or beneficiary must meet the gross income limitations specified in Section 63-3022H(3), Idaho Code, for that type of property. For example, if the property was breeding livestock, the shareholder, partner, or beneficiary must have more than one-half (1/2) of his gross income for the taxable year of the sale from farming or ranching operations in Idaho. (3-30-07) 032. Multistate Entities . A nonresident shareholder of an S corporation or a nonresident partner of a partnership required to allocate and apportion income as se t forth in Section 63-3027, Idaho Code, shall compute his Idaho capital gains deduction on his interest in income of that portion of the qualifying capital gains allocated or apportioned to Idaho. (3-20-97) 043. Examples . (3-20-97) a.XYZ Farms, a multistate partnership, sold three (3) parcels of farmland: one (1) in Idaho purchased seven (7) years ago, one (1) in Washington, and one (1) in Oregon. The sale of the Idaho property resulted in a forty thousand dollar ($40,000) gain, the sale of the Washington property resulted in a thirty thousand dollar ($30,000) gain, and the sale of the Oregon property resulted in a twenty thousand dollar ($20,000) loss, for a net gain of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000). The income and loss from the sale of the farmland is determined to be business income and is included in income apportionable to Idaho. The partnership has a seventy-five percent (75%) Idaho apportionment factor. The three (3) nonresident partners sh are equally in the partnership profits. Each nonresident partner reports capital gain net income in determining taxa ble income for the year and may claim an Idaho capital gains deduction of six thousand dollars ($6,000), computed as follows: ($40,000 Idaho gain X 75% apportionment factor = $30,000 gain apportioned to Idaho X 1/3 interest = $10,000 attributable to each partner X 60% = $6,000 capital gains deduction allowable on each partner's nonreside nt return). For taxable year 2001 only, the capital gains deduction is eighty percent (80%) of the capital gain net income from qualified property, or eight thousand dollars ($8,000). After 2001, the capital gains deduction returns to sixty percent (60%) or six thousand dollars ($6,000). (3-30-07) b.Assume the same facts as in Paragraph 173.04.a., of this rule, except that one (1) of the nonresident partners reported capital gain net loss on his federal return. Because the partner did not meet the criteria of reporting capital gain net income in determining taxable income as required by Section 63-3022H(1), Idaho Code, he would not be entitled to the Idaho capital gains deduction on his Idaho return. (5-8-09) c.Assume the same facts as in Paragraph 173.04.a., of this rule, except that the Oregon property was sold at a ninety thousand dollar ($90,000) loss, resulting in capital gain net loss from the partnership. If a partner had other capital gains to report and reported capital gain net income on his federal income tax return, he would be entitled to part or all of the capital gains deduction computed on the Idaho property in Paragraph 173.04.a., of this rule, limited to the amount of the capital gain net income from all property included in taxable income by the partner. (5-8-09) d.Assume the same facts as in Paragraph 173.04.a ., of this rule, except that the farmland is determined to be nonbusiness income. Therefore, the forty thousand dollar ($40,000) gain from the sale of the Idaho farmland is allocated to Idaho. Assuming each partne r had no other capital gains or losses except from the partnership, each partner may claim an Idaho capital gains deduction of eight thousand dollars ($8,000), computed as follows: ($40,000 gain allocated to Idaho X 1/3 = $13,333 partner's share X 60% = $8,000 Idaho capital gains deduction allowable on each partner's nonresident return). Fo r taxable year 2001, the capital gains deduction is eighty percent (80%) of the capital gain net income from qualified property, computed to be ten thousand six hundred and sixty-seven dollars ($10,667). (5-8-09) e.An Idaho resident partner must report all partnership income to Idaho. As a result, his share of partnership income, including any capital gain included in apportionable income, is not limited by the apportionment factor of the partnership. Therefore, in the example in Pa ragraph 173.04.a., of this rule, a resident partner may claim an Idaho capital gains deduction of eight thousand dollars ($8,000) computed as follows: ($40,000 Idaho gain X 1/3 IDAHO STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0101-1502 Income Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 258 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9interest X 60% = $8,000). For taxable year 2001, the capital gains deduction is eighty percent (80%) of the capital gain net income from qualified property, computed to be ten thousand six hundred and sixty-seven dollars ($40,000 Idaho gain X 1/3 interest X 80% = $10,667). (5-8-09) f.Gains that cannot be traced back to the sale of Idaho qualifying property do not qualify for the Idaho capital gains deduction. (3-30-07) (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS) 201. NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYBACKS AND CARRYOVERS (RULE 201). Section 63-3022(c), Idaho Code. 01. Definitions for Purposes of Net Operating Loss Carry backs and Carryovers . (3-20-97) a.The term net operating loss deduction means the sum of the Idaho net operating losses carried to another taxable year and subtracted in computing Idaho taxable income. (3-20-97) b.A net operating loss is absorbed when it has been fully subtracted from Idaho taxable income, as modified by Section 63-3021, Idaho Code. (4-5-00) 02.

(3-20-97) b.Adjustments to a net operating loss deduction may be made even though the loss year is closed due to the statute of limitations , but will not result in any tax due or refund for the closed taxable years .(3-20-97) ( ) 03. Adjustments in Carry back and Carryover Years . (3-20-97) a.Adjustments to income, including modifications pursuant to Section 63-3021, Idaho Code, in a carryback or carryover year must be made for purposes of determining, how much, if any, of the net operating loss may be carried over to subsequent years. (4-5-00) b.Adjustments are made pursuant to the law applicab le to the carryback or carryover year. (4-5-00) c.Adjustments may be made even though the year is closed due to the statute of limitations , but will not result in any tax due or refund for the closed taxable years . (3-20-97) ( ) 04. Net Operating (3-20-14) a.The net operating loss carryback allowed for the entire carryback period may not exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) per taxpayer. Each corporation that has a net operating loss and is included in a unitary group is limited to a maximum carryback of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000). (4-7-11) b.The sum of net operating loss deductions must not exceed the amount of the net operating loss incurred. (3-20-14) c.Except as provided in Paragraphs 201.04.d. and 201.04.f, a net operating loss is applied as follows: (3-20-14) i. Net operating losses incurred in taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 1990, but prior to January 1, 2000, are applied to the third preceding taxable year and if not absorbed, the difference is applied to the second preceding taxable year and if not absorbed, the diff erence is applied to the firs t preceding taxable year. The loss not absorbed in the carryback years is subtracted in the fifteen (15) su cceeding taxable years, in order, until IDAHO STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0101-1502 Income Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 259 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9absorbed. (3-20-14) ii. Net operating losses incurred in taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2000, but prior to January 1, 2013, are applied to the second preceding taxable year and if not absorbed, the difference is applied to the first preceding taxable year. The loss not absorbed in the car ryback years is subtracted in the twenty (20) succeeding taxable years, in order, until absorbed. (3-20-14) iii. Net operating losses incurred in taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2013, are applied to the twenty (20) succeeding taxable years, in order, until absorbed. (3-20-14) d.For taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 2013, if the taxpayer makes a valid election to forego the carryback period as provided in Subsection 201.05, the provisions of Subsection 201.04.c. do not apply and the net operating loss carryover is applied as follows: (3-20-14) i. For net operating losses incurred in taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 1990, but prior to January 1, 2000, the net operating loss is subtracted in the fifteen (15) succeeding taxable years, in order, until the loss is absorbed. (4-5-00) ii. For net operating losses incurred in taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2000, but prior to January 1, 2013, the net operating loss is subtracted in the twenty (20) succeeding taxable years, in order, until the loss is absorbed. (3-20-14) e.For taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 2013, if the taxpayer fails to make a valid election to forego the carryback period, the net operating loss must be carried back. If a carryback year is closed due to the statute of limitations, the net operating loss carryback may not result in a refund for the closed taxable year. (3-20-14) f.For net operating losses incurred in taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2013, if an amended return carrying back the loss is filed within one (1) year of the end of the taxable year of the net operating loss, the net operating loss is applied to the second pr eceding taxable year and if not absorbed, the difference is applied to the first preceding taxable year. The loss not abso rbed in the carryback years is subtracted in the twenty (20) succeeding taxable years, in order, until absorbed. (3-20-14) 05.

Order in Which Losses Are Applied in a Year . Loss carryovers are deducted before deducting any loss carrybacks applicable to the same taxable year. (3-20-97) 07. Documentation Required When Claiming a Net Operating Loss Deduction . A taxpayer claiming a net operating loss deduction for a taxable year must file with his return for that year a concise statement setting forth the amount of the net operating loss deduction claimed and all material and pertinent facts, including a detailed schedule showing the computation of the net op erating loss and its carryback or carryover. (3-20-97) 08. Conversion of C Corporation to S Corporation . An S corporation may not carry over or back a net operating loss from a taxable year in which the corporation was a C corp oration.

(4-7-11) 252. NONRESIDENT AND PART-YEAR RESIDENT INDIVIDUALS -- ADJUSTMENTS ALLOWED IN COMPUTING IDAHO ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME (RULE 252). Section 63-3026A(6), Idaho Code. 01. In General . Deductions allowed in computing adjusted gross income will be allowed in computing Idaho adjusted gross income unless specifically denied by Idaho law. The amount allowed will be computed as provided in this rule. Each computation in this rule will include the amounts reported for the taxable year unless otherwise indicated. (3-20-14) 02. Deductions Directly Related to Sp ecific Items of Income or Property . If the deduction directly relates to a specific item of income or property, the allowable deduction will be computed by dividing the amount of related income reported in Idaho income by the total of such related income reported in federal income. This percentage is multiplied by the deduction to arrive at the amount allowed as an Idaho deduction. If the deduction is related to property that did not generate income during the taxable year, the deduction will be allowed in the proportion that the property to which the deduction rela tes was located in Idaho. Examples of some of these deductions include the following: (3-20-14) a.Penalty on early withdrawal of savings. The allowable deduction will be computed by dividing the interest income of the time savings deposit subject to the penalty included in Idaho income by the total interest income of the time savings deposit included in federal income. This percentage is multiplied by the penalty deduction allowed for federal purposes. (3-20-14) b.Certain business expenses of reservists, performing artists, and fee-basis government officials. (3-29-10) c.Domestic production activities deduction. The allowable deduction will be computed by dividing the qualified production activities income included in Idaho income by the total qualified production activities income. This percentage is multiplied by the domestic production activities deduction allowed for federal purposes. (3-20-14) d.Jury duty pay remitted to an employer. (3-29-10) e.Deductible expenses related to income from the rental of personal property engaged in for profit. (3-29-10) f.Reforestation amortization and expenses. The allowable deduction will be computed by dividing the income from the related timber operations included in Idaho income by the total income from the related timber operations.

The action is authorized pursuant to Sections 63-105A and 63-802, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than September 16, 2015. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with di sabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below.DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: Rule 315: Use of Ratio Study to Equalize Boise School District - At termination of a revenue allocation area (raa), the Boise School District needs in structions on how to handle the incr ement value. The increment value of a terminating raa will be included in the taxable value and if a ratio study indicates that an adjustment should be made, the adjustment will be applied to the actual value including the increment value. Rule 626: Property Exempt from Taxation - Certain Personal Property - This rule provides guidance to taxpayers and both ISTC appraisers and county assessors on the impl ementation of HB29. This rule directs the reporting and apportionment procedures of the I.C. 63-602KK (2) personal property exemption for operating properties as provided for in new law (HB29). A cross reference is provided to expl ain that \"taxpayer\" is the cl aimant of the exemption and that I.C. 63-201 defines a \"person\". This rule is changed so that the operator's statem ent reports only the personal property items located in Idaho; the tax code area need not be reported. Operating properties that operate in multiple counties are entitled to an exemption equal to the lesser of the amount 1) computed by multiplying the number of counties that the operating property operates in times $100,000, or 2) the value of personal property reported by the company. The private rail car company size, which is meas ured by the company's taxable value, determines the apportionment of value and allocation of the tax collected fr om rail car companies, is determined after deducting the exemption from the Idaho value prior to apportionment. This rule provides that operating property apportionment occurs after subtracting th e exemption from the Idaho value. The ru le provides notice to operating property companies when their locally assessed property is granted the exemption. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: No fees or charges have been imposed or increased in this rulemaking. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if app licable, of any negative fi scal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year resulting from this rulemaking: There is no negative fiscal impact to the general fund as a result of this rulemaking. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(1), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemaking was conducted. The Notice of Intent to Promulgate Rules - Negotiated Rulemaking was published in the July 1, 2015 Idaho Administrative Bulletin, Volume 15-7, pages 91-92 .

USE OF RATIO STUDY TO EQUALIZE BOISE SCHOOL DISTRICT (RULE 315).Sections 63-315, 33-802(6) Idaho Code 01. Procedures for Boise School District Ratio Studies . The ratio study conducted by the State Tax Commission to comply with the requir ements of Section 63-315, Idaho Code, shall be conducted in accordance with the \"Standard on Ratio Studies\" referenced in Rule 006 of these rules. The following speci fic procedures will be used. (4-2-08) a.Information on property sales, which meet the requirements of arm's length and market value sales, will be obtained and assembled into samples representing various primary categories, described in Subsections 130.02 through 130.06 of these rules, and secondary categories, described in Rules 510, 511, and 512 of these rules, within designations defined in Subsection 315.02 of this rule in the Boise School District. Except when sales or appraisals must be added or deleted to improve representativeness, sales used will be those occurring within the Boise School District between October 1 of the year preceding the year for which adjusted market value is to be computed and September 30 of the year for which adjusted market value is to be computed. Each sale price is to be adjusted for time and compared to market value for assessment purposes for the year for which adjusted market value is to be computed, to compute ratios to be analyzed. The State Tax Commission may use sales from extended time periods and may add appraisals when data is lacking. The State Tax Commission may delete sales when necessary to improve representativeness. (4-2-08) b.A ratio will be determined for each sale by dividing the market value for assessment purposes of the property by the adjusted sale price or appraised value. (7-1-98) c.A statistical analysis is to be conducted for the sales and any appraisals in each property designation described in Subsection 315.02 of this rule in the Boise School District and appropriate measures of central tendency, uniformity, reliability, and normality computed. (4-2-08) d.With the exception of any property designations with extended time frames or added appraisals, if fewer than five (5) sales and appraisals are available, no adjustment to the taxable value of the designation will be made. (7-1-98) e.If there are five (5) or more sales and appraisals and it is determined with reasonable statistical certainty that the property designation is not already at market value for assessment purposes, an adjusted market value will be computed for the Boise School District by dividing the taxable value for the year for which adjusted market value is to be determined by the appropriate ratio derived from the ratio study. The appropriate ratio to be used IDAHO STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1504 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 268 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9shall be the weighted mean ratio calculated from the sample for each designation, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that this statistic has been distorted by n onrepresentative ratios. In this case the median may be substituted: (4-2-08) f.Within the Boise School District, adjusted market value or taxable value for each primary and each applicable secondary category of real, personal and operating property will be summed to produce the total adjusted market value for the Boise School District. The Boise Schoo l District taxable value will then be divided by this adjusted market value to produce the overall ratio of assess ment in the Boise School Distri ct. Statewide totals are to be calculated by compiling county totals. (4-2-08) g.Urban renewal increment values will not be included in the taxable value or the adjusted market value for the Boise School District. Upon receipt of an urban renewal agency 's resolution recommending the adoption of an ordinance for termination of a revenue allocation area by December 31 of a given year, the increment value in the immediate prior year will be included in the taxable value and the adjusted market value for the Boise School District. If the resolution is received prior to the first Mo nday in April, the actual value for the immediate prior year shall be adjusted by adding the increm ent value. If any ratio study based adjustments are warranted, as provided in this rule, they shall be app lied to the actual value includin g the increment value. If the resolution is received on or after the first Monday in April, but by September 1, a co rrected certification of actual an d adjusted values shall be provided as soon as practical. (4-2-08)( ) h.\"Reasonable statistical certainty,\" that the property designation in question is not at market value for assessment purposes, is required. Su ch certainty is tested using ninety percent (90%) confidence intervals about the weighted mean or median ratios. If the appropriate confidence interval includes ninety-five percent (95%) or one hundred five percent (105%), there is not \"reasonable statis tical certainty\" that the property designation is not at market value for assessment purposes. (3-30-01) i.Primary and secondary categories subject to adjust ment following the procedure outlined in this rule and ratio study designations from which measures of central tendency used for adjustments will be derived are: (3-30-07) j.For all secondary categories, described in Rule 510, 511, or 512 of these rules but not contained in the list in Paragraph 315.01.i. of this rule, adjusted market value will equal taxable value. (3-30-07) k.\"Appraisal\" or \"appraised value\" refers to any State Tax Commission provided independently conducted property appraisal. (7-1-98) 02. Use of Property Designations . In computing the ratio for the Bo ise School District, the State Tax Commission will designate property as residential or commercial and shall assign appropriate primary categories, described in Subsections 130.02 through 130.06 of these rules, and secondary categories, described in Rules 510, 511, and 512 of these rules, to these designations as shown in Paragraph 315.01.i. of this rule. For the Boise School District, adjusted market value shall be computed by di viding the appropriate ratio ascertained for each of these Secondary Categories Primary Categories Ratio Study Designations 12, 15, 18, or 20 Vacant Residential Land Residential 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 26, 31, 34, 37, 40, 41, 46, 47, 48, or 50Improved Residential Property Residential 47, 49, or 65Manufactured Home on Leased LandResidential 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 21, or 22Vacant Commercial or Industrial LandCommercial 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 21, 22, 27, 33, 35, 36, 38, 39, 42, 43, or 51Improved Commercial or Industrial PropertyCommercialIDAHO STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1504 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 269 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9designations into the sum of the taxable values for each primary and secondary category assigned to a designation. Except as provided in Subsection 315.06 of this rule, for th e taxable value in any secondary category to be included in said sum, at least one (1) observation (sale or appraisal) from that secondary category must be present in the ratio study. If the ratio for any given designation in the Boise Scho ol District indicates that th e market value for assessment purposes cannot be determined with reasonable statistical cer tainty to differ from statutorily required market value, the taxable value shown on the Boise School District abstr act(s) required pursuant to Subsection 315.04 of this rule for each of the secondary categories included in that designation shall be the adjusted market value for said designation for said school district. (4-2-08) 03. Assessor to Identify Boise School Districts .

(4-11-15) 06. Exception from Requirement for at Least One Observation for Use of Secondary Category in Adjusted Value Determination . Properties identified as secondary categories 10 and 31 rarely sell separately from farms and therefore do not appear in any ratio study. However, the level of assessment typically is similar to that of other rural residential property, including property in secondary categories 12, 15, 34, and 37. For any ratio study where there is an adjustment to be made to the assessed values in the residential designation, such adjustment shall be applied to any assessed value in secondary category 10, prov ided there is at least one (1) observation (sale) of property identified in either secondary category 12 or 15. Such adjustment shall also be applied to any assessed value in secondary category 31, provided there is at least one (1) observation (sale) of pr operty identified in either secondary category 34 or 37. (3-30-07) 07. Certification of Values . The values required to be certified to the county clerk by the first Monday in April each year under Section 63-315, Idaho Code, shall be published on the State Tax Commission's web site or provided in an alternate format on request by the first Monday in April each y ear to satisfy this required certification.

PROPERTY EXEMPT FROM TAXATION -- CERTAIN PERSONAL PROPERTY - TAXPAYER OWNERSHIP CLARIFICATION (RULE 627). Section 63-602KK(2), Idaho Code 01. Idaho Code Section 63-602KK(2) Provides Taxpayers persons With One Exemption in Each Idaho County in Which They Meet the Ownership Rules . Although taxpayers persons are limited to receiving one (1) exemption per county, a taxpayer person owning more than one (1) business within one (1) county may be entitled to more than one (1) exem ption within the county. (4-11-15) ( ) 02. Illustration of Common Enterprise and IRC Section 267 Restriction . For purposes of the Idaho Code Section 63-602KK(2) exemption, a taxpayer person includes two (2) or more individuals or organizations using the property in a common enterprise, and the individuals or organizations are within a relationship described in Section 267 of the Internal Revenue Code. This is illustrated in the following chart: (4-11-15) ( ) a.First, an analysis must be made to determine if a common enterprise exists. If entities or individuals are organized to manage a common scheme of business, they would be in a common enterprise. (4-11-15) i. Horizontal Commonality is demonstrated by the following chart: IDAHO STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1505 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 276 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9(4-11-15) ii. Vertical Commonality is demonstrated by the following chart: (4-11-15) b.Second, an analysis would be made to determine whether the ownership between the entities is within the relationships identified in Section 267 of the Internal Revenue Code. If such a relationship is found to exist, and the businesses are in a common enterprise, then the entities or individuals would be considered one (1) taxpayer person for purposes of this exemption. (4-11-15) ( )Here, the usual functions involved in a working car manufacturing company are split between several LLCs, all of which own the property involved with the functions they perform. The operation of the business is no different than if all the functions were combined in just Car Manufacturing, LLC Here, a business operation is split so that each step in a process is designated to a different LLC. All the steps rely on the one below in order to produce the final product, or process. IDAHO STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1505 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 277 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9c.Ownership alone does not determine whether entities are considered one (1) taxpayer person for purposes of this exemption. Two (2) businesses can have identical ownership, and each receive the exemption, providing they do not operate as a common enterprise. In addition, entities in a common enterprise can receive separate exemptions, providing that their ownership does not consist of a relationship identified in Section 267 of the Internal Revenue Code. (4-11-15) ( ) d.The following examples are given to illustrate eligibility situations related to common enterprise and related ownerships: (4-11-15) i. Example 1. This is an example of a common enterprise, that is entitled to two (2) exemptions because the owners are not related in a manner as described in Section 267 of the Internal Revenue Code. (4-11-15) ii. Example 2. This is an example of the same owner with multiple businesses not all united in a common enterprise. Bob's car businesses are common enterprises, and therefore entitled to only one (1) exemption for all the car businesses. Bob's used furniture business is not involved with Bob's car businesses, so Bob is entitled to an additional ex emption related to his used car business.So long as Bob and John are not related in a manner identified in IRC 267, two (2) exemptions exist. One (1) for Factory Labor, LLC. The other for all of Bob's businesses, because they are in a common enterprise and are all owned by him. IDAHO STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1505 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 278 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9(4-11-15) iii. Example 3. This is an example of multiple businesses being entitled to only one (1) exemption because a common enterprise exists an d all the businesses are constructively owned in a manner identified in IRC 267. (4-11-15) (4-11-15) iv. Example 4. This is an example showing how owners of common enterprises may intersect. (4-11-15)Here, one (1) exemption exists for all of the entities because they are in a common enterprise, due to their vertical commonality, and are all constructively owned by Bob, pursuant to IRC 267. IDAHO STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1505 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 279 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9(4-11-15) e.In cases of partial ownership as noted in example four wherein Bob owns ten percent (10%) and Dump Trucks, LLC owns ninety percent (90%) only the ma jority owner is eligible to receive this exemption. (4-11-15) 03. Cross Reference . For information on applying for the exemption provided in Section 63- 602KK(2), Idaho Code, see Rule 626 of these rules.

(3-20-14) a.Wells drilled for the production of oil, gas or hydrocarbon condensate may include the well, casing, and other structures permanently affixed inside the well, and the land inside the perimeter of the well. (3-20-14) b.The well shall include the part where the gas producing stratum has been successfully cased off from any oil. (3-20-14) 02. Ineligible Land and Equipment . (3-20-14) a.Wellheads and gathering lines or any line extending above ground level shall not qualify. Equipment used for the extraction, storage, or transportation of oil, gas, or hydrocarbon condensate shall not qualify.This is an example of how common enterprises can in tersect with one another. The companies Bob owns completely receive one exemption; J ohn's companies also receive one ex emption, including Rock Crusher, LLC, because John's ownership interest in that company falls within IRC 267. IDAHO STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1505 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 280 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9(3-20-14) b.Land, other than that used for the well as defined in Subsection 632.01 of these rules, shall not qualify. If the presence of the well increases the market va lue of nearby land, the assessed value of such land shall reflect the increase, unless the land qualifies independen tly for any other property tax exemption.

(4-5-00)Urban 20Description of Land Secondary CategoryIDAHO STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1505 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 282 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9a.\"Change of Land Use Classification.\" \"Change of land use classification\" shall mean any change in land use resulting in a secondary category change and in a chan ge in taxable land value to be reflected on the current property roll. (4-7-11) b.\"Incremental Value as of December 31, 2006.\" \"Incremental value as of December 31, 2006\" means the total of the increm ent values on the property roll, subsequent property roll, missed property roll, and operating property roll for the 2006 tax year. (4-7-11) c.\"Nonresidential Structure.\" \"Nonresidential stru cture\" shall mean any structure listed by the assessor in any secondary category not described as residential, manufactured homes, or improvements to manufactured homes in Rule 511 of these rules. (4-2-08) 02. New Construction Roll Listing . \"Listing\" shall mean a summary report of the net taxable value of property listed on the new construction roll. This listing shall include the taxable value of qualifying new construction throughout each taxing district or unit, but shall not include otherwise qualifying new construction, the value of which will be included in the increment value of any revenue allocation area (RAA) within any urban renewal district encompassed by the taxing district or unit. In addition, new construction related to change of land use classification, but required by section 50-2903(4) to be added to the base assessment roll, cannot be added to any new construction roll. This report is to summarize the value reported on the new construction roll by taxing district or unit. Taxing districts and units shall be listed in the same order that is used for the certification of value required pursuant to Section 63-510(1), Idaho Code. (3-29-12) a. Qualifying new construction which is valued by the State Tax Commission shall be reported to the county assessor for each applicable taxing district by October 1 and shall be li sted by the assessor on the immediate next new construction roll. ( ) ab.Previously allowable new construction that has never been included. When a taxing district proves new construction described by Section 63-301A(3), Idaho Code, occurred during any one of the immediately preceding five (5) years and has never been included on a ne w construction roll, the county assessor must list that property on the immediate next new construction roll at the value proven by the taxing district. Any such additional new construction must also be separately listed for each taxi ng district or unit. The taxing district has the burden of proving the new construction was omitted from a new construction roll and the value that would have been listed for that property had it been listed on the appropriate new construction roll. No taxing district shall ever be granted any increase in budget authority greater than the amount that would have resulted had the property been listed on the appropriate new construction roll. Regardless of the year that the new construction should have been listed on the appropriate new construction roll, additional budget authority resulting from new construction previously omitted from a new construction roll and listed on the current year's new construction roll shall be permitted only if the taxing district is in compliance with the budget hearing notification requirements of Section 63-802A, Idaho Code, for the current year. (3-29-12) b c.Reporting the amount of taxable market value to be deducted. For each taxing district or unit, the new construction roll listing shall separately identify the total amount of taxable market value to be deducted as required in Section 63-301A(1)(f), Idaho Code. In addition to other requirements, the amount of value deducted shall never exceed the amount originally adde d to a new construction roll. (3-29-12) cd.Determining the amount of taxable market value to be deducted. The amount of taxable market value to be deducted under Section 63-301A(1)(f)(i), Idah o Code, shall be determined by the highest authority to which the assessment is ultimately appealed. Accordingly, adjustments should not be made until there has been a final decision on any appeal. In addition, the deduction for lower values resulting from appeals shall be made only for property that was placed on a new construction roll with in the immediately preceding five (5) years. (3-29-12) 03. Special Provisions for Value Increases and Decreases . Special provisions for value increases and decreases related to change of land use classification as define d in Paragraph 802.01.a. of this rule or increases in land value resulting from loss of the exemption provided in Section 63-602W(4), Idaho Code. (4-4-13) a.Value increases. Certain related land value increases are to be included on the new construction roll. (4-7-11)IDAHO STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1505 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 283 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9i. Except as provided in Subparagra ph 802.03.a.iii., increases in land value shall be reported on the new construction roll in the year in which the new category appears on the curr ent property roll. (4-4-13) ii. Except as provided in Subparagraph 802.03.a.iii., the increase in taxable land value to be reported shall be computed by subtracting the taxable land value, had the land remained in its previous use category, from the taxable land value in the current use category. (4-4-13) iii. Subject to the limitations found in Paragraph 802.06.a. of this rule, increases in land value resulting from loss of the exemption provided in Section 63-602W(4), Idaho Code, shall be reported on the new construction roll in the year the exemption is lost, provided this occurs no later than June 30 of that year. If the exemption is lost after June 30 of a given year, the resulting increase in land value shall be reported on the new construction roll in the immediate following year. (4-4-13) b.Value decreases. Certain related land value decreas es are to be included on the new construction roll and subtracted from total new construction value for any taxing district. The amount of decrease in any one year shall never exceed the amount of value originally added to the new construction roll for the same property. (4-4-13) i. Value decreases are to be reported only for land for which taxable market value was reduced as a result of change of land use classification or granting of the exemption for site improvements provided in Section 63- 602W(4), Idaho Code, during any one (1) of the immediat ely preceding five (5) years and for which an increase in value due to addition of site improvements or change of land use classification during the same five-year period had been added to a new construction roll. For the site improvement exemption provided in Section 63-602W(4), Idaho Code, the five-year period shall commence with the year fo llowing the year th e exemption is first granted. For example, if a parcel first received the exemption in 2012, any site improvement related addition to a new construction roll for 2008 or more recently must be subtracted from the 2013 new construction roll, unles s the exemption is lost by June 30, 2013, in which case there is no subtraction and no addition to the new construction roll for the loss of this exemption. (4-4-13) ii. If the current land category is the same as the category prior to the change that resulted in an addition to the new construction roll, the amount to be subtracted shall equal the amount originally added. For example, a dry grazing land parcel th at would have had a value of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) became commercial land and was assessed at fifty thousand dollars ($50,0 00). The forty thousand dollar ($40,000) difference was reported on the new construction roll in year one (1). In year two (2), the parcel is reclassified as dry grazing land and is to be assessed at fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000). The forty thousand dollar ($40,000) difference that was added to the year one (1) new construction roll must be deducted from the value shown on the new construction roll in year two (2). (4-7-11) iii. If the current land category is different than the category prior to the change that resulted in an addition to the new construction roll, the amount to be subtracted shall be the lesser of the amount originally added or the amount that would have been added had the first change in land use been from the current land category. For example, a dry grazing land parcel th at would have had a value of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) became commercial land and was assessed at fifty thousand dollars ($50,0 00). The forty thousand dollar ($40,000) difference was reported on the new construction roll in year one (1). In year two (2), the parcel is reclassified as irrigated agricultural land and would have had a value in year one (1) of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000). The amount to be subtracted from the value shown on the new construction roll in year two (2) is thirty thousand dollars ($30,000). (4-7-11) iv. Provided the criteria in Subparagraph 802.03.b.i. are met, value decreases resulting from previously included land value becoming exempt are to be reported and subtracted. (4-4-13) v. Except as provided in Subparagraph 802.03.b.vi., only land value decreases that meet the criteria listed in Subparagraphs 802.03.b.i. or 802.03.b.iv. of this rule and include and result from a change in land secondary category can be considered. (4-4-13) vi. Provided the criteria in Subparagraph 802.03.b.i. are met, land value decreases resulting from the exemption provided in Section 63-602W(4), Idaho Code, are to be subtracted from the new construction roll in the year immediately following the most r ecent year in which the ex emption has been granted. To comply with the IDAHO STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1505 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 284 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9budget adjustments required by Section 63-802, Idaho Code, which limits taxing district budgets based on the highest amount of property tax revenue requested during the previous three (3) years, such subtraction shall be required for up to three (3) years, provided the property continues to receive the exemption. For ex ample, a property for which five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) was added to the 2011 new construction roll for site improvements that were added and taxable at that time receives a five hu ndred thousand dollar ($500,000) exemption pursuant to Section 63-602W(4), Idaho Code, in 2012. The property cont inues to receive the exempt ion in the same amount in 2013, but the exempt amount increases to five hundred twenty thousand dollars ($520,000) in 2014. The property loses the exemption before June 30, 2015. However, the 201 5 value of the site improvements has been determined to be only four hundred thousand dollars ($400,000) because of market value changes. Therefore, only four hundred thousand dollars ($400,000) in value is added as a result of the loss of the exemption. Table A shows the effect on each year's new construction roll, while Table B shows the effect on a hypothetical taxing district's maximum allowable property tax budget. (4-4-13) vii. Table A - Effect on New Construction Roll: (4-4-13) viii. In Table B, assume that the taxing district has a tax levy rate of zero point zero zero two five (0.0025) in 2010, a total taxable value of one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) in 2010 and a property tax budget in 2010 that is two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) and was the highest of the preceding three (3) years. The total amount of new construction is the amount due to the site improvements and no other value change occurs in the district during the period shown. There are no property tax replacement monies for this district. Beginning in 2011 the taxing district le vies the maximum it is allowed each y ear. The factor of one point zero three (1.03) shown in Table B is used to calculate the allowable three percen t (3%) increase. (4-4-13) ix.

Manufactured Housing . \"Installation\" of new or used manufactured housing shall mean capturing the net taxable market value of the improvement(s) that did not previously exist within the county. (7-1-97) 05. Partial New Construction Values . Except as provided in Subsection 802.06 of this rule, the net taxable market value attributable directly to new construction shall be reported on the new construction roll in the tax year it is placed on the current assessmen t roll. Except as provided in Subsection 802.06 of this rule, any increase in a nonresidential parcel's taxable value, due to new construc tion, shall be computed by subtracting the previous year's or years' partial taxable value(s) from the current taxable valu e. If any of this difference is attributable to inflation, such value, except as provided in Subsection 802.06 of this rule, shall not be included on the new construction roll. Example: Assume a partially completed, nonresidential improvement was assessed at ten thousand dollars ($10,000) as of January 1, 2009. The improvement was occupied February 2, 2009. Assume the ten thousand dollar ($10,000) value was on the 2009 new construction roll. Assume that in 2010 the improvement is assessed at ninety thousand dollars ($90,000). Assume there has been no inflation. The value that can be reported on the 2010 new construction roll is calculated as follows: (4-7-11) 06. Change in Status . (4-2-08) a.A previously exempt improvement which become s taxable shall not be included on the new construction roll, unless the loss of the exemption occurs during the year in which the improvement was constructed or unless the improvement has lost the exemption provided in Section 63-602W(3) or (4), Section 63-602E(3), or Section 63-602NN, Idaho Code. For any such property, the amount that may be included on the new construction roll shall be the value of the portion of the property subject to the exemption at the time the exemption was first granted. Examples of special cases for the exemption provide d in Section 63-602W(4), Idaho Code, follow: (4-4-13)2013 Site improvements exempt - $500,000 $273,174($266,512 X 1.03) - ($500,000 X 0.002665120) (tax levy rate = $273,174 / $100,000,000 = 0.002731744) 2014 Site improvements exempt - $500,000 $280,003($273,174 X 1.03) - ($500,000 X 0.002731744) (tax levy rate = $280,003/ $100,000,000 = 0.002800033 2015Loses site improvement exemption before June 30+ $400,000 $289,523($280,003 X 1.03) + ($400,000 X 0.002731744)(tax levy rate = $289,523/ $100,400,000 = 0.002883696 2010 Value $90,000 2009 Value Already Reported on New Construction Roll <$10,000> 2010 New Construction Roll Value (this improvement) $80,000Table B - Effect on Hypothetical Taxing District's Maximum Allowable Property Tax Budget Year OccurrenceEffect on New Construction Roll (for that year)Maximum Allowable Property Tax Budget CalculationsIDAHO STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1505 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 286 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9i. If the exemption is lost by June 30 of the year in which the exempt amount was to be subtracted from the new construction roll, then there shall be no subtrac tion, nor shall the formerly exempt amount be added, to the new construction roll, unless it had been previously subtracted from a new construction roll. For example, the property first became exempt in 2012, but lost the exemption by June 30, 2013. The 2013 new construction roll was not adjusted downward, so any previous inclusion of the exempt value would not be added in the future. Had the property lost the exemption later in 2013, there would have been a subtraction from the 2013 new construction roll and a subsequent addition to the 2014 new construction roll. (4-4-13) ii. If the exemption was granted to property for which no value had been added to any new construction roll, the value of the property (site improvemen ts) at the time the exemption was first granted may be added to the new construction roll following loss of the exemption. (4-4-13) b.Upon receipt by the State Tax Commission of a resolution recommending adoption of an ordinance for termination of an RAA under Section 50-2903(5), Idaho Code, any positive difference of the most current increment value minus the \"incremental value as of Decembe r 31, 2006,\" shall be added to the appropriate year's new construction roll. When this information is received after th e fourth Monday in July, this positive net increment value shall be added to the following year's new construction roll. (4-7-11) c.When a portion of an RAA is de-annexed, the fo llowing steps must be used to determine the amount to be added to the cu rrent year's new construction roll and the amount to be subtracted from the \"incremental value as of December 31, 2006.\" (4-7-11) i. Step 1. For the parcels in the de-annexed area, determine the December 31, 2006, increment value. (4-7-11) ii. Step 2. Subtract the increment value determined in Step 1 from the most current increment value for the parcels in the de-annexed area. (4-7-11) iii. Step 3. Add any positive difference calculated in Step 2 to the current year's new construction roll value. (4-7-11) iv. Step 4. Adjust the \"incremental value as of December 31, 2006\" for the RAA by subtracting the increment value determin ed in Step 1. (4-7-11) v. The following table shows the amount to be added to the current year's new construction roll and the amount to be subtracted from the \"incremental valu e as of December 31, 2006\" applicable to the adjusted remaining RAA. The table assumes an area is de-ann exed from an original RAA effective December 31, 2009.

Limitation on Annexation and New Construction Roll Value . For any taxing district annexing property in a given year, the new construction roll for the following year shall not include value that has been included in the annexation valu e. When an annexation includes any part of a revenue allocation area, only taxable value that is part of the current base va lue of the taxing district is to be included in the annexation value reported for that taxing district for the year followi ng the year of the annexation.

The action is authorized pursuant to Section 40-312, Idaho Code and Section 49-201, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than September 16, 2015.

Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below.DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The proposed changes bring the rule into alignment with current Idaho Transportation Department (ITD) fees, terminology, procedures and administrative processes. The changes have no major impacts on the public or industry. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: In 2009, the Idaho Legislature passed House Bill 334 in which, the legislature made changes to statutory Idaho Transportation Department (ITD) fees. With specific regard to IDAPA 39.02.26, the legislature amended Section 49- 202, Idaho Code, which details what fees ITD can collect. Specifically, Section 49-202(m), Idaho Code, changed the fee charged \"For issuing letters of temporary vehicle clear ance to Idaho-based motor carriers\" from ten dollars ($10) to eighteen dollars ($18). This chan ge directly impacted IDAPA 39.02.26, therefore the proposed rule change is necessary to reflect the change made in this legislation. The fee change became effective January 1, 2010. HB 334 made several amendments and in Section 49-202, Idaho Code, modified numerous ITD fees. In total, ITD estimated that all of the changes made to the Department's fees would result in an additional $13.1 million annually for ITD's State Highway Account. The one-time cost of these fee changes was estimated to be $72,000; which includes 600 hours of system programming by contractors ($45,000) and form development/printing ($27,000). Again, it should be noted that the addition al monies generated and the costs associated with the implementation of these changes encompass the modifications made to numerous ITD fees in HB 334 and not simply the amendment of Section 49-202(m), Idaho Code. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if app licable, of any negative fi scal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year resulting from this rulemaking: There is no fiscal impact to the state general fund. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(2), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because the proposed rule changes are simple in nature.INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: Pursuant to Section 67-5229(2)(a), Idaho Code, the following is a brief synopsis of why the materials cited are being incorporat ed by reference into this rule: There are no materials incorporated by reference into this rule.

A farm tractor when attached to an implement of husbandry or when drawi ng an implement of husbandry shall be construed to be an implement of husbandry and is not required to have a permit. Farmers, eq uipment dealers or custom operators may be issued single trip or annual permits under this rule for transportation of farm tractors, having a width in excess of nine (9) feet to or from a farm involving Interstate Highway travel. The transportation of farm tractors or implements of husbandry for hire, or not being transported from one farm operation to another, is a common-carrier operation. Exemptions from legal width limitation do not apply to common-carrier operations. Farm tractors or implements of husbandry hauled for hire, or used in the furtherance of a business (not to include farming operations), are subject to the same overlegal permit regulations as other oversize loads when the width of the load exceeds legal-width limitations, and must operate under oversize permits. (3-30-01) 02. Other Than Farm to Farm . Implements of husbandry exceeding eight (8) feet six (6) inches in width being transported other than from one (1) farm oper ation to another farm operation shall require overlegal permits except when the farmer or their designated agent is transportin g implements of husbandry and equipment for the purpose of: (3-29-12) a.The repair or maintenance of such implements of husbandry and equipment when traveling between a farm and a repair or maintenance facility during daylight hours; or (3-29-12) b.The purchase or sale of such implements of husbandry or equipment when traveling between a farm and a dealership, auction house, or other facility during daylight hours. (3-29-12) 03. Farm Permits . Single trip permits must be ordered at the permit office and the operator may post a security bond to establish credit (See IDAPA 39.03.21 , \"Rules Governing Overlegal Permit Fees,\" Section 300) and thereby qualify to complete an application form, call the overlegal permit office for a permit number, and carry the application form with the overwidth vehicle in lieu of the overlegal permit form . Under provisions of IDAPA 39.03.19, \"Rules Governing Annual Overlegal Permits,\" Section 100, annual permits will be issued to towing units or to self-propelled farm tractors or towed units, or blanket permits may be issued to an Idaho domicile applicant without vehicle identification. Such blanket permits may be transferred from one vehicle to another vehicle but shall be valid only when the permit is with the overwidth vehicle and/or load. A photocopy of the permit is valid provided that the Pilot/Escort Vehicle and Travel Time Requirements Map and Vertical Clearance of Structures Map furnished by the Idaho Transportation Department are included. Such annual permits for implements of husbandry or farm tractors are subject to the same maximum dimensions, trav el time exclusions and safety requirements as other overwidth annual permits and are valid for continuo us travel for twelve (12) consecutive months. (3-29-12) (7-23-15)T 04. Overwidth Farm Trailers . Trailers or semi-trailers exceeding eight feet six inches (8' 6\") wide, but not wider than the implement of husbandry, used for the transportation of implements of husbandry from a farm to a farm for agricultural operations, shall be exempt from overlegal permitting requirements. This exemption does not apply to trailers or semi-trailers used in common carrier operations, hauling for hire or used in the furtherance of a business (not to include farming operations). (3-20-04) a.Exempt trailers, as listed above, may not be us ed to haul implements of husbandry that are narrower than the overwidth trailer. (3-20-04) b.Empty trailers, as listed above, being used to pick up or drop off an implement of husbandry from a farm to a farm are also exempt and must be reduced to a practical minimum dimension (i.e. dropping side extensions).

(RESERVED) (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS) 100. GENERAL. Overlegal permits may be issued for continuous operation to haul or transport nonreducible loads having specified maximum dimensions of oversize or overweight provided such permits for multiple trips can maintain the same measure of protection to highway facilities and to the traveling public as is provided by single trip permits. (4-5-00) 01. Oversize . Permits for continuous operation, oversize only. (10-2-89) a.Permits for continuous operation shall be issued to one (1) specified power unit. The permittee may tow various units with the specified power unit, either as towaway vehicles or as trailers hauling oversize loads. Except as provided in IDAPA 39.03.07, \"Rules Governing Restricted Routes for Semitrailers,\" 39.03.16, \"Rules Governing Oversize Permits for Non-Reducible Vehicles and/or Loads,\" Section 200 and 39.03.22, \"Rules Governing Overlegal Permits for Extra-Length Vehicle Combinations,\" oversize loads shall be nonreducible in width, length, or height. In the case of specially constructed equipment, mounted on a towed vehicle, or if the towed vehicle is only hauling an oversize but not overweight load, the permit may be issued to the towed vehicle. (4-5-00) b.Maximum size of loads or vehicles transported under authority of an annual oversize or manufactured homes/modular buildings and office trailer permit, for black and interstate routes, shall be limited to a width of foursixteen (146) feet six (6) inches (manufactured homes, modular buildings, and office trailers limited as per IDAPA 39.03.17, \"Rules Governing Permits for Manufactured Homes, Modular Buildings, and Office Trailers\"), a height of fifteen (15) feet six (6) inches, and to a comb ination length of one hundred ten (110) feet including load overhang. Annual oversize permits for red coded routes shall be limited to a width of twelve (12) feet six (6) inches. A current Pilot/Escort Vehicle and Travel Time Requir ements Map shall accompany su ch permits for extended operations and shall be considered to be a part of the permit. (4-5-00) (7-23-15)T 02. Overweight/Oversize. Permits for continuous operation involving overweight loads shall be subject to the following conditions and requirements: (10-2-89) a.Annual permits may not be issued for gross weights in excess of two hundred thousand (200,000) IDAHO TRANSPORATION DEPARTME NT Docket No. 39-0319-1501 Rules Governing Annual Overlegal Permits Temporary & Proposed Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 305 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9pounds for any colored route. Gross weights in excess of two hundred thousand (200,000) pounds must operate by single trip permit. (4-5-00) b.Since the fees are now based on the number of axle s and gross weight to calculate the fee per mile, annual overweight permits will have to be issued to various combinations including those with a different number of axles and higher gross weights for those axles. You will no lo nger be able to operate less axles than the number stated on the permit, because the fee per mile (using less axles) would be greater than the fee per mile for the higher number of axles and gross weight. The number of axles in the vehi cle configuration may be greater than the number of axles listed on the permit. The gross weight of the vehicle config uration may be less than the gross weight stated for each colored route, but your fee per mile will be based on and reported at the stated gross weight for each colored route on the permit (i.e. black, purple, green and yellow) and the number of axles. (4-5-00) c.A percent reduction in the total fees may be given when the following requirements are met: (4-5-00) i.A two percent (2%) reduction per axle group (such as tandem or tridem), to a maximum of ten percent (10%) per vehicle configuration, for axle groups that are wider than ten (10) feet. (4-5-00) ii.A two percent (2%) reduction per axle group (such as tandem or tridem), to a maximum of ten percent (10%) per vehicle configuration, for axle groups with sixteen (16) tires per axle. (4-5-00) iii.If both the above requirements are met for an axle group, a five percent (5%) reduction per axle group, to a maximum of twenty-five percent (25%) per vehicle configuration may be given. This reduction will be taken off of the total roadway use fees charged for the vehicle and will not reduce the administrative fee. (4-5-00) dc.To comply with Section 49- 4361001, Idaho Code, the permittee will make quarterly reports of mileage to the Department at the permitted weight levels separate from the registered weight mileage otherwise required to be reported to that agency. Mileage for single trip overweight permits is charged for and collected at the time of issuance, and need not be reported elsewhere. Unlaiden miles are reported at the registered weight of a vehicle or combination of vehicles A quarterly statement is mailed out every three (3) months and required to be returned to the department even if no miles were traveled using the overweight part of the annual permit during that quarter. Every time a non-reducible vehicle and/or load exceeds legal axle weights and/or eighty thousand (80,000) pounds operating under an annual overweight/oversize perm it it must be reported on the quarterly statement. The gross weight, number of axles, and the total miles traveled will be the information needed to report. If the gross weight is in between two (2) weight categories listed on the permit/quarterly statement, the permittee will report at the next higher gross weight limit . (4-5-00)(7-23-15)T ed.Annual permits involving overweight loadings will be available at the following levels: (4-6-92) i. Red Routes -- The red routes contain posted bridges and require approval or analysis from the Department. A vehicle configuration may be issued an annual overweight/oversize permit for travel on red routes, upon completion of an analysis verifying the requested weights are acceptable. The annual permit will be issued for a specific vehicle configuration, operating on a specific route, at specific weights. All information will be listed on the annual permit and will be subject to revocation at such time the vehicle configuration changes (such as axle spacings), the approved weights change , or a bridge rating changes. (8-4-95) ii. Yellow Routes -- The yellow overweight level is based on a single axle loading of twenty-two thousand five hundred (22,500) pounds, a tandem axle loading of thirty-eight thousand (38,000) pounds, and a tridem axle loading of forty-eight thousand (48,000) pounds or the equivalent loading as determined by spacings and number of axles and computed by applying the formula W = 560 ((LN/N-1) + 12N + 36). (4-6-92) iii. Orange Routes -- The orange overweight level is based on a single axle loading of twenty-four thousand (24,000) pounds, a tandem axle loading of forty-one thousand (41,000) pounds, and a tridem axle loading of fifty-one thousand five hundred (51,500) pounds or the equivalent loading as determined by spacings and number of axles and computed by applying the formula W = 600 ((LN/N-1) + 12N + 36).

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: Congress recently amended the Clean Water Act's requirements for the State Revolving Fund (SRF) loan effort. The amendment requires that Idaho consider population trends and unemployment data, in addition to the existing criteria of median household income, when determining which borrowers will qualify for disadvantaged loan terms. This rule change incorporates the additional criteria for evaluating the eligibility for disadvantaged loans that are not already in the existing rule. The additional re quired elements are a result of the 2014 amendments to the Clean Water Act (Pub.L. 113-121). Prospective grant and loan recipients, consulting engin eers, grant and loan administrators, and other funding agencies may be interested in commenting on this proposed rule. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Language the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should be addressed. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to present the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality in the fall of 2015 for adoption of a pe nding rule. The rule is expected to be final and effective upon adjournment of the 2016 legislative session if adopted by the Board and approved by the Legislature.

DISADVANTAGED LOANS.Disadvantaged Loan Awards. In conjunction with the standa rd loans, the Department may award disadvantaged loans to applicants deemed disadvantaged using the following criteria: (3-29-12) 01. Qualifying for a Disadvantaged Loan . In order to qualify for a disadvantaged loan, a loan applicant must have an annual us er rate for wastewater service fo r residential customers which exceeds one and one- half percent (1\u00bd%) two percent (2%) of the applicant community's median household income or, if the user rate is between one and one-half percent (1\u00bd%) and two percent (2%) of the applicant community's median household income, the community must also have: unemployment th at exceeds the state average; and a decreasing population . The applicant shall agree to a thirty (30) year loan unless the design life of the project is documented to be less than thirty (30) years. The annual user rate would be based on all operating, maintenance, replacement, and debt service costs (both for the existing system and for upgrades). If the applicant's service area is not within the boundaries of a municipality, or if the applicant's service area's median household income is not consistent with the municipality as a whole, the applicant may use the census da ta for the county in which it is locat ed or may use a representative survey, conducted by a Department approved, objective third party, to verify the median household income of the applicant's service area. (3-29-12) ( ) 02. Adjustment of Loan Terms . DEQ will equally apportion funds available for principal forgiveness to all prospective disadvantaged loan recipients. Consistent with achieving user rates of one and one-half percent (1\u00bd%) of the applicant community's median household income as per the criteria set forth in Subsection 021.01 , and where possible with available funds, loan terms may be adjusted in the following order: decreasing the interest rate and providing principal forgiveness. (3-29-12) ( ) a.Decreasing Interest Rate. The loan interest rate may be reduced from the rate established by the Director for standard loans to a rate that results in an annual user rate equal to one and one-half percent (1\u00bd%) of median household income equaling the criteria set forth in Subsection 021.01 . The interest rate may be reduced to as low as zero percent (0%). (3-29-12) ( ) b.Principal Forgiveness. If even at zero percent (0%) interest, the annual user rate per residential user still exceeds one and one-half percent (1\u00bd%) of median household income, the criteria set forth in Subsection 021.01, then the principal which causes the user charge to exceed one and one-half percent (1\u00bd%) may be reduced except the criteria set forth in Subsection 021.01 may be partially forgiven or reduced. tThe principal reduction cannot exceed fifty percent (50%) of the total loan. Principal forgiveness terms may be revised (from initial estimates established in the annual Intended Use Plan) based upon final construction cost s, such that loan terms do not result in user rates that are below one and one-half percent (1\u00bd%) of the applicant community's median household income the criteria set forth in Subsection 021.01 .

This action is authorized by Sections 39-101 et seq., and 39-175A-C, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: No hearings have been scheduled. Pursuant to Section 67-5222(2), Idaho Code, a public hearing will be held if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency. Written requests for a hearing must be received by the undersigned on or before September 18, 2015. If no such written request is received, a public hearing will not be held. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: This rulemaking has been initiated to implement Idaho Code \u00a7 39-175C, which directed DEQ to seek approval of a National Pollutant Di scharge Elimination System (NPDES) program. These rules will be promulgated under a new DEQ rule chapter, \"Rules Regulating the Idaho Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Program,\" IDAPA 58.01.25. In order to gain approval of the program, DEQ must have rules in place that meet th e requirements of the Clean Water Act and federal regulations. These rules will establish procedures for submitting permit applications, writing and issuing IPDES permits, filing appeals, fee structures, developing general permits, and other required components of an NPDES program. DEQ negotiated certain elements of the IPDES program including the permit application process, the appeals process, the fee structure, and co mpliance enforcement with IPDE S permits. With respect to required NPDES program components, federal regulations have been incorporated by reference into the proposed rules. Major and minor municipal discharges; industrial dischargers; facilities, organizations and individuals seeking coverage under a general permit; facilities that currently have or will have a pretreatment permit to a wastewater facility; and other groups interested in point source discharges to waters of the United States in Idaho may be interested in commenting on this proposed rule. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to present the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality in the fall of 2015 for adoption of a pending rule. The rule is expected to be final and effective upon adjournment of the 2016 legislative session if adopted by the Board and approved by the Legislature. Before this rule docket can become effective, it will be necessary to revise various sections of Idaho Code. DEQ intends to submit draft companion legislation for consideration by the 2016 Idaho Legislature. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: Pursuant to Section 67-5229(2)(a), Idaho Code, the following is a brief synopsis of why the incorpora tion by reference is necessary: Incorporating the federal regulations by reference benefits the agency and simplifies the overall rule chapter by incorporating those sections of the federal regulations that must be adhered to in the course of developing an IPDES program. This reduces the overall costs of the rule and w ill allow the agency to adhere to the legally mandated deadline of submitting a complete application to EPA by September of 2016. The alternative to incorporating the federal regulations by reference is to restate the federal regulations in the new IPDES rules. This approach allows for the regulated public to have the entire rule set in one location rather than having to search out 40 CFR chapters. The downside is additional rulemaking pages and the associated annual rule administrative costs. FEE SUMMARY: Pursuant to Section 39-175C(2), Idaho Code, the Board of Environmental Quality is authorized to proceed with negotiated rulemaking and all other actions that may eventually be necessary to obtain approval of a state NPDES program by the United States Environmenta l Protection Agency including rules authorizing the collection of reasonable fees for processing and implemen ting an NPDES permit program. Such fees shall not be assessed or collected until the state obtains an approved NPDES program consistent with the requirements of Section 39-175C, Idaho Code. Section 110 of the rule imposes an a nnual fee which must be paid for each year beginning one year after the effective date of the IPDES pr ogram for the affected category of discharger.DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0125-1401 Idaho Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Program Proposed Fee Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 314 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year when the pending rule will become effective: Not applicable.

Construction on a site at which an existing source is located, results in a modification subject to Subsection 201. 02, rather than a new source (or a new discharger) if the construction does not create a new building, structure, facility, or installation meeting the criteria of Subsection 120.01, but otherwise alters, replaces, or adds to exis ting process or production equipment. ( ) 04. New Source Construction. Construction of a new source has commenced if the owner or operator has: ( ) a.Begun, or caused to begin as part of a continuous on-site construction program: ( ) i. Any placement, assembly, or installation of facilities or equipment; or ( ) ii. Significant site preparation work including clearing, excavation or removal of existing buildings, structures, or facilities which is necessary for the placement, assembly, or installation of new source facilities or equipment; or ( ) b.Entered into a binding contractual obligation for the purchase of facilities or equipment which are intended to be used in its operation within a reasonable time. Items which do not constitute contractual obligations under this section include: ( ) i. Options to purchase or contracts which can be terminated or modified without substantial loss; ( ) ii.

The discharger or treatment works treating do mestic sewage is not in compliance with the conditions of the general permit; ( ) ii. A change has occurred in the availability of demonstrated tec hnology or practices for the control or abatement of pollutants applicable to the point source or treatment works treating domestic sewage; ( ) iii. Effluent limitation guidelines are promulgated for point sources covered by the general permit; ( ) iv. A Water Quality Management plan containing requirements applicable to such point sources is approved; ( ) v. Circumstances have changed since the time of the requ est to be covered so that the discharger is no longer appropriately controlled under the general permit, or either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge is necessary; ( ) vi. Standards for sewage sludge use or disposal have been promulgated for the sludge use and disposal practice covered by the general IPDES permit; or ( )DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0125-1401 Idaho Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Program Proposed Fee Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 385 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9vii. The discharge(s) is a significant contributor of pollutants. In making this determination, the Department may consider the following factors: ( ) (1) The location of the discharge with respect to waters of the United States; ( ) (2) The size of the discharge; ( ) (3) The quantity and nature of the pollutants discharged to waters of the United States; and ( ) (4) Other relevant factors. ( ) d.Any owner or operator authorized by a general permit may request to be excluded from the coverage of the general permit by applying for an individual permit. ( ) i. The owner or operator shall submit an application under Section 105 (Application for an Individual IPDES Permit), with reasons supporting the request, to the Department no later than ninety (90) days after the publication of the general permit.

( ) iii. The Department shall grant a request by issuing an individual permit if the reasons cited by the owner or operator are adequate to support the request. ( ) e.When an individual IPDES permit is issued to an owner or operator otherwise subject to a general IPDES permit, the applicability of the general permit to the individual IPDES permittee is automatically terminated on the effective date of the individual permit. ( ) f.A source excluded from a general permit, solely b ecause it already has an individual permit, may request that the individual permit be revoked, and that it be covered by the general permit. Upon revocation of the individual permit, the general permit shall apply to the source. ( ) 06. Case-by-Case Requirements for Individual Permits . ( ) a.The Department may require any owner or operator authorized by a general permit to apply for an individual IPDES permit as provided in Subsection 130.05.c., only if the owner or operator has been notified in writing that a permit application is required. This notice shall include a brief statement of the reasons for this decision, an application form, a statement setting a time for the owner or operator to file the application, a statement that on the effective date of the individual IPDES permit, the general permit as it applies to the individual permittee shall automatically terminate, and a statement that the owner or operator may appeal the Department's decision as provided in Section 204 (Appeals Process). The Department may grant additional time upon request of the applicant. ( ) b.Prior to a case-by-case determina tion that an individual permit is required for a storm water discharge under this section (see 40 CFR 122.26(a)(1)(v), (a)(9)(iii), and Subsection 105.19), the Department may require the discharger to submit a permit application or other information regarding the discharge under the Clean Water Act section 308. ( ) i. In requiring such information, the Department shall notify the discharger in writing and shall send an application form with the notice. ( ) ii.

(RESERVED)DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0125-1401 Idaho Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Program Proposed Fee Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 386 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9200. RENEWAL OF IPDES PERMITS. 01. Interim Effluent Limits . Except as provided in Subsection 200.02, when a permit is renewed or reissued, interim effluent limitations, standards or conditio ns must be at least as stringent as the final effluent limitations, standards, or conditions in the previous permit unless the circumstances on which the previous permit was based: ( ) a.Have materially and substantially changed since the time the permit was issued; and ( ) b.Would constitute cause for permit revocation and reissuance under Subsection 201.02. ( ) 02. Final Effluent Limits . In the case of effluent limitations established by the Department on the basis of the Clean Water Act section 402(a)(1)(B), a permit may not be renewed, reissued, or modified on the basis of effluent guidelines promulgated under Clean Water Act section 304(b) after the original issuance of a permit, to contain effluent limitations which are less stringent than th e comparable effluent limitations in the previous permit, except a permit may be renewed, reissued, or modified to contain a less stringent effluent limitation applicable to a pollutant, if: ( ) a.Material and substantial alterations or additions to the permitted facility occurred after permit issuance, which justify the application of a less stringent effluent limitation; ( ) b.Information is available: ( ) i. Which was not available at the time of permit issuance (other than revised regulations, guidance, or test methods) and which would have justified the application of a less stringent effluent limitation at the time of permit issuance; or ( ) ii. Which the Department determines indicates that t echnical mistakes or mistaken interpretations of law were made in issuing the permit under the Clean Water Act section 402(a)(1)(b); ( ) c.A less stringent effluent limitation is necessary because of events over which the permittee has no control and for which there is no reasonably available remedy; ( ) d.The permittee has received a permit modification Clean Water Act section has installed the treatment facilities required to meet the effluent limitations in the previous permit and has properly operated and maintained the facilities but has nevertheless been unable to achieve the previous effluent limitations. In this case the limitations in the reviewed, reissued, or modified permit may reflect the level of pollutant control actually achieved (but shall not be less stringent than required by effluent guidelines in effect at the time of permit renewal, reissuance, or modification). ( ) 03. Effluent Limits and Water Quality Standards . In no event may a permit with respect to which Subsection 200.02 applies be renewed, reissued, or modified to contain an effluent limitation which is less stringent than required by effluent guidelines in effect at the time the permit is renewed, reissued, or modified. In no event may such a permit to discharge into waters of the United States be renewed, issued, or modified to contain a less stringent effluent limitation if the implementation of such limitation would result in a violation of a water quality standard under IDAPA 58.01.02, \"Water Quality Standards.\" ( ) 201. MODIFICATION, OR REVOCATION AND REISSUANCE OF IPDES PERMITS. 01. Procedures to Modify, or Revoke and Reissue Permits . ( ) a.Permits may be modified, or revoked and reissued either at the request of any interested person (including the permittee) or upon the Department's initiative. However, permits may only be modified or revoked and reissued for the reasons specified in Subsection 201.02. All requests shall be in writing and shall contain facts or DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0125-1401 Idaho Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Program Proposed Fee Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 387 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9reasons supporting the request. ( ) b.If the Department tentatively decides to modify or revoke and reissue a permit, the Department shall prepare a draft permit under Section 108 (Draft Pe rmit and Fact Sheet), incorp orating the proposed changes. ( ) i. The Department may request additional information and, in the case of a modified permit, may require the submission of an updated application. If the tentative decision is to revoke and reissue a permit, the Department shall require the submission of a new application. ( ) ii. In a permit modification under this section, only those conditions to be modified shall be reopened when a new draft permit is prepared. All ot her aspects of the existing permit shall remain in effect for the duration of the unmodified permit. ( ) iii. When a permit is revoked and reissued under this section, the entire permit is reopened just as if the permit had expired and was being reissued. During any revocation and reissuance proceeding, the permittee shall comply with all conditions of the existing permit until a new final permit is reissued. ( ) iv. Minor modifications, as defined in Subsection 201.03, do not require the development of a draft permit, fact sheet, nor must minor modifications be subj ected to public notification and comment. ( ) 02. Causes to Modify, or Revoke and Reissue Permits . When the Department receives any pertinent information (for example, inspects the facility, receives in formation submitted by the permittee as required in the permit, receives a request for modification or revocation and reissuance under Subsection 201.01, or conducts a review of the permit file), the Department may determine whether or not one (1) or more of the causes listed in Subsections 201.02.c. and 201.02.d. for modification or revocation and reissuance or both exist. ( ) a.If cause exists, the Department may modify or rev oke and reissue the permit accordingly, subject to the limitations of Subsection 201.01.b., and may request a ne w or updated application, if necessary. ( ) b.If cause does not exist under this section, the Department shall not modify or revoke and reissue the permit. ( ) c.The following are causes for modification but no t revocation and reissuance of permits except when the permittee requests or agrees: ( ) i. There are material and substantial alterations or additions to the permitted facility or activity (including a change or changes in the permittee's sludge use or disposal practice), which occurred after permit issuance, and which justify the application of permit conditi ons that are different or ab sent in the existing permit. ( ) ii. The Department has received new information. Permits may be modified during their terms for this cause only if the information was not available at the time of permit issuance (other than revised regulations, guidance, or test methods) and would have justified the application of different permit conditions at the time of issuance: ( ) (1) For IPDES general permits (Section 130) this cause includes any information indicating that cumulative effects on the environment are unacceptable; and ( ) (2) For new source or new discharger IPDES permits (Section 120), this cause shall include any significant information derived from effluent testing required under Subsection 105.08 or 105.16 after issuance of the permit. ( ) iii. The standards or regulations on which the permit was based have been changed by promulgation of amended standards or regulations or by judicial decision after the permit was issued. Permits may be modified during their terms for this cause only as follows: ( )DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0125-1401 Idaho Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Program Proposed Fee Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 388 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9(1) For promulgation of amended standards or regulations, when: ( ) (a) The permit condition requested to be modified was based on a promulgated effluent limitation guideline, EPA approved or promulgated water quality standards, or the Secondary Treatment Regulations under 40 CFR Part 133; ( ) (b) EPA has revised, withdrawn, or modified that portion of the regulation or effluent limitation guideline on which the permit condition was based, or has approved a state action with regard to a water quality standard on which the permit condition was based; and ( ) (c) A permittee requests modification in accordance wi th Subsection 201.01 or 203.01 within ninety (90) days after notice of the action on which the request is based; and ( ) (2) For judicial decisions, a court of competent ju risdiction has remanded and stayed EPA or Idaho promulgated regulations or effluent limitation guidelines, if the remand and stay concerns that portion of the regulations or guidelines on which the permit condition was based and a request is filed by the permittee in accordance with Subsection 201.01 or 203.01 within ninety (90) days of judicial remand. ( ) iv. The Department determines good cause exists for modification of a compliance schedule, such as an act of God, strike, flood, or materials shortage or other events over which the permittee has little or no control and for which there is no reasonably available remedy. Howe ver, in no case may an IPDES compliance schedule be modified to extend beyond an applicable Clean Water Act statutory deadline. ( ) v. When the permittee has filed a request for a variance under Clean Water Act section 301(c), 301(g), 301(i), 301(k), or 316(a) or for fundamentally different f actors within the time specified in Section 310 (Variances). ( ) vi. When required to incorporate an applicable Clean Water Act 307(a) toxic effluent standard or prohibition, under Subsection 302.04. ( ) vii. When required by the reopener conditions in a permit, which are established in the permit under Subsection 302.05 or 40 CFR 403.18(e) Upon request of a permittee who qualifies for effluent limitations on a net basis, or when a discharger is no longer eligible for net limitations, as provided in Subsection 303.07. ( ) ix. As necessary under 40 CFR Program Requirements: Development and Implementation by POTW). ( ) x. Upon failure of an approved state to notify, as required by the Clean Water Act section 402(b)(3), another state whose waters may be affected by a di scharge from the approved state. ( ) xi. When the level of discharge of any pollutant wh ich is not limited in th e permit exceeds the level which can be achieved by the technol ogy-based treatment requirements approp 125.3(c). ( ) xii. To in Subsection 302.08. ( ) xiii. To modify a schedule of compliance to reflect the time lost during construction of an innovative or alternative facility, in the case of a POTW which has received a loan under IDAPA 58.01.12, \"Rules for Administration of Water Pollution Control Loans.\" In no case shall the compliance schedule be modified to extend beyond an applicable Clean Water Act statutory deadline. ( ) xiv. For a small MS4, to include an effluent lim itation requiring implementation of a minimum control measure or measures as specified in 40 CFR 122.34(b) when: ( ) (1) The permit does not include such measure(s) based upon the determination that another entity was DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0125-1401 Idaho Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Program Proposed Fee Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 389 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9responsible for implementation of the requirement(s), and ( ) (2) The other entity fails to implement measure(s) that satisfy the requirement(s). ( ) xv. To correct technical mistakes, such as errors in calculation, or mistaken interpretations of law made in determining permit conditions. ( ) xvi. When the discharger has installed the treatment technology considered by the permit writer in setting effluent limitations imposed under the Clean Water Act section 402(a)(1) and has properly operated and maintained the facilities but nevertheless has been unable to achieve those effluent limitations. In this case, the limitations in the modified permit may reflect the level of pollutant control actually achieved (but shall not be less stringent than required by a subsequently promulgated effluent limitations guideline). ( ) xvii. The incorporation of the terms of a CAFO's nutrient management plan into the terms and conditions of a general permit when a CAFO obtains coverage under a general permit in accordance with 40 CFR 122.23(h) and Section 130 (General Permits) is not a cause for modification pursuant to the requirements of this section. ( ) xviii. When required by a permit condition to incorporate a land application or sludge disposal plan for beneficial reuse of sewage sludge, to revise an existing la nd application or sludge disposal plan, or to add a land application or sludge disposal plan as required by IDAPA 58.01.16.650, \"Wastewater Rules,\" and Section 380 (Sewage Sludge) of these rules. ( ) d.The following are causes to modify or, alternatively, revoke and reissue a permit: ( ) i. Cause exists for termination under Subsection 203.03, and the Department determines that modification or revocation and reissuance is appropriate; ( ) ii. The Department has received notification, as required in the permit, of a proposed transfer of the permit; or ( ) iii. A permit also may be modified to reflect a transfer after the effective date of an automatic transfer (Subsection 202.02) but will not be revoked and reissued after the effective date of the transfer except upon the request of the new permittee. ( ) 03. Minor Modifications of Permits . Upon the consent of the permittee, the Department may modify a permit to make the corrections or allowances for changes in the permitted activity listed in this subsection without following the procedures of Sections 108 (Draft Permit an d Fact Sheet), 109 (Public Notification and Comment), and Subsection 201.01. Any permit modification not processed as a minor modification under this subsection must be made for cause and must meet the requirements of Section 108 (Draft Permit and Fact Sheet) and Section 109 (Public Notification and Comment). Minor modifications may: ( ) a.Correct typographical errors; ( by the permittee; ( ) c.Change an interim compliance date in a schedule of compliance, provided the new date is not more than one hundred twenty (120) days after the date specified in the existing permit and does not interfere with attainment of the final compliance date requirement; ( ) d.Allow for a change in ownership or operational control of a facility where the Department determines that no other change in the permit is necessary, provided that a written agreement containing a specific date for transfer of permit responsibility, coverage, and liability between the current and new permittee has been submitted to the Department; ( ) e.Change the construction schedule for a discharger which is a new source. No such change shall affect a discharger's obligation to have all pollution control equipment installed and in operation prior to discharge DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0125-1401 Idaho Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Program Proposed Fee Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 390 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9under Section 120 (New Sources and New Discharges), and 40 CFR 122.29(d); ( ) f.Delete a point source outfall when the discharge from that outfall is terminated and does not result in discharge of pollutants from other outfalls except in accordance with permit limits; ( ) g.Incorporate conditions of a POTW pretreatment program that has been approved in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.11 or a modification that has been approved in accord ance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.18 of the POTW's permits; changes to the terms of a CAFO's nutrient management plan that have been revised in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 122.42(e)(6); or ( ) i.Make a change in a permit provision that will result in neither allowing an actual or potential increase in the discharge of a pollutant or pollutants into the environment nor result in a reduction in monitoring of a permit's compliance with applicable statutes and regulations. ( ) 202. TRANSFER OF IPDES PERMITS. 01. Transfers by Modification . Except as provided in Subsection 202.02, a permit may be transferred by the permittee to a new owner or operator only if the permit has been modified or revoked and reissued under Subsection 201.02.d., or a minor modification made under Subsection 201.03, to identify the new permittee and incorporate such other requirements as may be n ecessary under the Clean Water Act.

( ) ii. An intake pollutant must be from the same body of water as the discharge in order to be eligible for an intake credit. An intake pollutant is considered to be from the same body of water as the discharge if the Department finds that the intake polluta nt would have reached the vicinity of the outfall point in the receiving water within a reasonable period had it not been removed by the permittee. This finding will be established if: ( ) (1) The background concentration of the pollutant in the receiving water (excluding any amount of the pollutant in the facility's discharge) is similar to that in the intake water; and ( ) (2) There is a direct hydrological connection between the intake and discharge points. ( ) iii. The Department may also consider other site-specific factors relevant to the transport and fate of the pollutant to make the find ing in a particular case that a pollutant would or would not have reached the vicinity of the outfall point in the receiving water with in a reasonable period had it not been removed by the permittee. ( ) iv. An intake pollutant from ground water may be considered to be from the same body of water if the Department determines that the pollutant would have reached the vicinity of the outfall point in the receiving water within a reasonable period had it not been removed by the permittee. ( ) b.Consideration of intake pollutants for technology based effluent limitations: ( ) i. Upon request of the discharger, technology-based ef fluent limitations or standards shall be adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the discharger's intake water if: ( ) (1) The applicable effluent limitations and standards contained in 40 CFR Part 401 through 471, specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis; or ( ) (2) The discharger demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable technology-based limitations and standards would, if properly installed and operated, meet the limitations and standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters. ( ) ii. Credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) or total suspended solids (TSS) should not be granted unless the permittee demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of th e generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere. ( ) iii. Credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable limitation or standard, up to a maximum value equal to the influent value. Additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with permit limits. ( ) iv. Credit shall be granted only if the discharger demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water into which the discharge is made. The Department may waive this requirement if the Department finds that no environmental degradation will result. ( ) v. This section does not apply to the discharge of raw water clarifier sludge generated from the treatment of intake water. ( ) c.Consideration of intake pollutants for water quality based effluent limitations: ( ) i. The Department will evaluate if there is reasonable potential for the discharge of an identified intake pollutant to cause or contribut e to an exceedance of a narrative or numeric water quality criterion. If the Department determines that an intake pollutant in the discharge does not have the reasonable potential to cause or contribute to an exceedance of an applicable water quality standard, the Department is not required to include a water quality-based effluent limit for the identified intake pollutant in the facility's permit. ( ) ii. If a reasonable potential exists, then water quality-based effluent limits may be established that DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0125-1401 Idaho Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Program Proposed Fee Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 414 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9reflect a credit for intake pollutants where a discharger demonstrates that the following cond itions are met: ( ) (1) The facility removes the intake water containing the pollutant from the same body of water into which the discharge is made; ( ) (2) The ambient background concentration of the pollu tant does not meet the most stringent applicable water quality criterion for that pollutant; ( ) (3) The facility does not alter the identified intake pollutant chemically or physically in a manner that would cause adverse water quality impacts to occur that would not occur if the pollutants had not been removed from the body of water; ( ) (4) The timing and location of the discharge would not cause adverse water quality impacts to occur that would not occur if the identified intake pollutant had not been removed from the body of water; ( ) (5) For the purpose of determining reasonable potential, the facility does not contribute any additional mass of the identified intake pollutant to its wastewater; and ( ) (6) For the purpose of determining water quality-based effluent limits, the facility does not increase the identified intake pollutant concentration at the point of di scharge as compared to the po llutant concentration in the intake water. A discharger may add mass of the pollutant to its waste stream if an equal or greater mass is removed prior to discharge, so there is no net addition of the pollutant in the discharge compared to the intake water. ( ) iii. Where a facility discharges intake pollutants from multiple sources that originate from the receiving water body and from other water bodies, the Depart ment may derive an effluent limit reflecting the flow- weighted amount of each source of the pollutant provided that conditions in 303.07.c.ii. of this subsection are met and adequate monitoring to determine compliance can be established and is included in the permit. ( ) iv. The permit will specify how compliance with mass and concentration-based limitations for the intake water pollutant will be assessed. This may be done by basing the effluent limitation on background concentration data. Alternatively, the Department may determine compliance by monitoring the pollutant concentrations in the intake water and in the effluent. This monitoring may be supplemented by monitoring internal waste streams or by a Department evaluation of the use of best management practices. ( ) v. Permit limits must be consistent with the assumptions and requirement of waste load allocations or other provisions in a TMDL that has been approved by the EPA. ( ) 08. Internal Waste Streams . ( ) a.When permit effluent limitations or standards imposed at the point of discharge are impractical or infeasible, effluent limitations or standards for discharges of pollutants may be imposed on internal waste streams before mixing with other waste streams or cooling water streams. In those instances, the monitoring required by Section 304 (Monitoring and Reporting Requirements) shall also be applied to the internal waste streams. ( ) b.Limits on internal waste streams will be imposed only when the fact sheet sets forth the exceptional circumstances which make such limitations necessary, such as: ( ) i. When the final discharge point is inaccessible (for example, under ten (10) meters of water);( ) ii. The wastes at the point of discharge are so diluted as to make monitoring impracticable; or ( )iii. The interferences among pollutants at the point of discharge would make detection or analysis impracticable. ( ) 09. Disposal of Pollutants into Wells, into POTWs, or by Land Application . ( ) a.When part of a discharger's process wastewater is not being discharged into waters of the United DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0125-1401 Idaho Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Program Proposed Fee Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 415 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9States because it is disposed into a we ll, into a POTW, or by land application thereby reducing the flow or level of pollutants being discharged into waters of the United States, applicable effluent standards and limitations for the discharge in an IPDES permit shall be ad justed to reflect the reduced raw wast e resulting from such disposal. Effluent limitations and standards in the permit shall be calculated by one (1) of the following methods: ( ) i. If none of the waste from a particular process is discharged into waters of the United States, and effluent limitations guidelines provide separate allocation fo r wastes from that process, all allocations for the process shall be eliminated from calculation of permit effluent limitations or standards; or ( ) ii. In all cases other than those described in Subsection 303.09.a.i., effluent limitations shall be adjusted by multiplying the effluent limitation derived by applying effluent limitation guidelines to the total waste stream by the amount of wastewater flow to be treated and discharged into waters of the United States, and dividing the result by the total wastewater flow. Effluent limitations and standards so calculated may be further adjusted under 40 CFR Part 125, subpart D, to make them more or less stringent if discharges to wells, POTWs, or by land application change the character or treatability of the pollutants being discharged to receiving waters. This method may be algebraically expressed as: ( ) b.Subsection 303.09.a. does not apply the extent that promulgated effluent limitations guidelines: ( ) i. Control concentrations of pollutants discharged but not mass; or ( ) ii. Specify a different specific technique for adjusting effluent limitations to account for well injection, land application, or disposal into POTWs. ( ) c.Subsection 303.09.a. does not alter a discharger's obligation to meet any more stringent requirements established under Sections 300 (Conditions Applicable to all Permits), 301 (Permit Conditions for Specific Categories), 40 CFR 122.42(e), and 302 (Establishing Permit Provisions). ( ) d.Disposal of discharge into injection wells is regulated by: ( ) i. Idaho Department of Water Resources, in co mpliance with the IDAPA 37.03.03, \"Rules and Minimum Standards for the Construction and Use of Injection Wells,\" for a Class I injection well; or ( ) ii. Health District having jurisdiction, in comp liance with IDAPA 58.01.03, \"Individual/Subsurface Sewage Disposal Rules,\" for a Class V injection well. ( ) e.Disposal of discharge onto the surface of the land is regulated by the Department under IDAPA 58.01.17, \"Recycled Water Rules.\" ( ) 304. MONITORING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. 01. Monitoring Requirements . A permit must include the following requirements for monitoring: ( ) a.Requirements concerning the proper use, maintena nce, and installation, when appropriate, of monitoring equipment or methods (including biological monitoring methods when appropriate); ( ) b.The type, intervals, and frequency of monitoring sufficient to yield data which are representative of the monitored activity including, when appropriate, continuous monitoring; ( )P=(E x N)/T; where P is the permit effluent limitation, E is the limitation derived by applying effluent guidelines to the total wast e stream, N is the wastewater flow to be treated and discharged to waters of the United States, and T is the total wastewater flow.DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0125-1401 Idaho Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Program Proposed Fee Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 416 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9c.Provisions for reporting the results of monitoring, including frequency, appropriate for the regulated activity based on the impact of that activity; ( ) d.The mass (or other measurement specified in th e permit) for each pollutant limited in the permit; ( ) e.The volume of effluent discharged f.Other measurements as appropriate, including: ( internal waste streams under Subsection 303.08; ( ) ii.

( ) 02. Reporting Monitoring Results . provided in Subsections 304.02.d. and 304.02.e., the Department will establish requirements to report monitoring results on a case-by-case basis with a frequency dependent on the nature and effect of the discharge, but in no case less than once a year. ( ) b.For sewage sludge use or disposal practices, the Department will establish requirements to monitor and report results on a case-by-case basis with a frequency dependent on the nature and effect of the sewage sludge use or disposal practice; minimally this shall be as speci fied in 40 CFR Part 503, Section 380 (Sewage Sludge) of these rules, and Idaho's Wastewater Rules, IDAPA 58.01.16 .650, \"Wastewater Rules,\" (where applicable), but in no case less than once a year. ( ) c.The Department will establish requirements to report monitoring results for storm water discharges associated with industrial activity wh ich are subject to an effluent limitati on guideline on a case-by-case basis with a frequency dependent on the nature and effect of the discharge, but in no case less than once a year. ( ) d.The Department will establish requirements to report monitoring results for storm water discharges associated with industrial activity, other than those addr essed in Subsection 304.02.c., on a case-by-case basis with a frequency dependent on the nature and effect of the discha rge. At a minimum, a permit for such a discharge must require the discharger to: ( ) i. Conduct an annual inspection of the facility site to identify areas contributing to a storm water discharge associated with industrial activity; ( ) ii. Evaluate whether measures to reduce pollutant loadings identified in a storm water pollution prevention plan are adequate and properly implemented in accordance with the terms of the permit or whether DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0125-1401 Idaho Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Program Proposed Fee Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 417 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9additional control measures are needed; ( ) iii. Maintain for a period of three (3) years a record summarizing the results of the inspection and a certification that the facility is in compliance with th e plan and the permit, and identifying any incidents of noncompliance; ( ) iv. Sign the report and certification in accordance wi th Section 090 (Signature Requirements); and ( ) v. Permits for storm water discharges associated with industrial activity from inactive mining operations may, where annual inspections are impracticable, require certification that the facility is in compliance with the permit, or alternative requirements, once every th ree (3) years by an Idaho licensed professional engineer. ( ) e.A permit that does not require monitoring results reports at least annually must require the permittee to report, at least annually, all instances of noncomp liance not reported under Subsection 300.12. ( ) 305. COMPLIANCE SCHEDULES. 01. General . An IPDES permit may, when appropriate, specify a schedule of compliance leading to compliance with the Clean Water Act and these rules. ( ) a.Any schedules of compliance under this section sh all require compliance as soon as possible, but not later than the applicable statutory deadli ne under the Clean Water Act. ( ) b.The first IPDES permit issued to a new source or a new discharger shall contain a schedule of compliance only when necessary to allow a reasonable opportunity to attain co mpliance with requirements issued or revised after commencement of construction, but less than three (3) years before commencement of the relevant discharge. ( ) c.For recommencing dischargers, a schedule of complia nce shall be available only when necessary to allow a reasonable opportunity to attain compliance with requirements issued or revised less than three (3) years before recommencement of discharge. ( ) d.If a permit establishes a schedule of compliance under this section that exceeds one (1) year from the date of permit issuance, the schedule must set out interim requirements and dates for achievement of the interim requirements. If the schedule includes interim requirements: ( ) i. The time between interim dates shall not exceed one (1) year, except that in the case of a schedule for compliance with standards for sewage sludge use and di sposal, the time between interim dates shall not exceed six (6) months; or ( ) ii. If the time necessary for completion of any in terim requirement (such as the construction of a control facility) is more than one (1) year and is not read ily divisible into stages for completion, the permit shall specify interim dates for the submission of reports of progress toward completion of the interim requirements and indicate a projected completion date. ( ) e.Within fourteen (14) days following each interim and final date of compliance, the permittee shall notify the Department in writing of its compliance or noncompliance with the interim or final requirements, or submit progress reports if Subsection 305.01.d.ii. is applicable. ( ) f.Permits may incorporate compliance schedules whic h allow a discharger to phase in, over time, compliance with water quality-based effluent limitations in accordance with IDAPA 58.01.02.400, \"Water Quality Standards.\" ( ) 02. Alternative Compliance . An IPDES permit applicant or permittee may cease conducting regulated activities (by terminating direct discharge for point sources) rather than continuing to operate DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0125-1401 Idaho Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Program Proposed Fee Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 418 September 2, 2015 - Vol. 15-9and meet permit requirements as follows: ( ) a.If the permittee decides to cease conducting regulated activities at a given time within the term of a permit which has already been issued: ( ) i. The permit may be modified to contain a new or additional schedule leading to timely cessation of activities; or ( ) ii. The permittee shall cease conducting permitted activities before noncompliance with any interim or final compliance schedule requirement already specified in the permit. ( ) b.If the decision to cease conducting regulated activ ities is made before issuance of a permit whose term will include the termination date, the permit shall contain a schedule leading to termination which will ensure timely compliance with applicable re quirements no later than the statutory deadline. ( ) c.If the permittee is undecided whether to cease conducting regulated activities, the Department may issue or modify a permit to contain two (2) schedules, as follows: ( ) i. Both schedules shall contain an identical interim deadline requiring a final decision on whether to cease conducting regulated activities no later than a date wh ich ensures sufficient time to comply with applicable requirements in a timely manner if the decision is to continue conducting regulated activities; ( ) ii. One (1) schedule shall lead to timely compliance with applicable requirements, no later than the statutory deadline; ( ) iii. The second schedule shall lead to cessation of regulated activities by a date which will ensure timely compliance with applicable requ irements no later than the statutory deadline; and ( ) iv. Each permit containing two (2) schedules shall in clude a requirement that after the permittee has made a final decision under Subsection 305.02.c., it shall foll ow the schedule leading to compliance if the decision is to continue conducting regulated activitie s, and follow the schedule leading to termination if the decision is to cease conducting regulated activities. ( ) d.The applicant's or permittee's decision to cease co nducting regulated activities shall be evidenced by a firm public commitment satisfactory to the Department , such as a resolution of the board of directors of a corporation.

Special Procedures for Decisions on Thermal Variances . ( ) a.The only issues connected with issuance of a particular permit on which the Department will make a final decision before the final permit is issued, are whether alternative effluent limitations would be justified under the Clean Water Act section 316(a) or whether cooling water intake structures will use th e best available technology under section 316(b). ( ) i. Permit applicants who wish an early decision on these issues should make a request to the Department, furnished with supporting reasons at the time their permit applications are filed. ( ) ii. The Department will then decide whether or not to make an early decision. If it is granted, both the early decision on Clean Water Act section 316 (a) or (b) i ssues and the grant of the balance of the permit shall be: ( ) (1) Considered permit issuance under these regulations, and ( ) (2) Subject to the same requirements of public notice and comment and the same opportunity for an appeal. ( ) b.If the Department, on review of the administ rative record, determines that the information necessary to decide whether or not the Clean Water Act sectio n 316(a) issue is not likely to be available in time for a decision on permit issuance, the Department may issue a permit for a term up to five (5) years. ( ) i. The permit shall require achievement of the effluent limitations initially proposed for the thermal component of the discharge, no later than the date otherwise required by law. ( ) ii. However, the permit shall also afford the permittee an opportunity to file a demonstration under Clean Water Act section 316(a), after conducting such studies as are required under 40 CFR 125.70 through 125.73. ( ) iii. A new discharger may not exceed the thermal effluent limitation which is initially proposed unless and until its Clean Water Act section 316(a) variance request is finally approved. ( Subsection 310.05.a. shall be: ( ) i. Publicly noticed as required by Section 109 (Public Notification and Comment), and ( ) ii. Conducted at a time allowing the permittee to take necessary measures to meet the final compliance date in the event its request for modification of thermal limits is denied. ( ) d.Whenever the Department defers the decision under the Clean Water Act section 316(a), any decision under the Clean Water Act section 316(b) may be deferred.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5221(1) and 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a temporary rule, and proposed rulemaking procedures have been initiated. The action is authorized pursuant to Section 1-2012, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than September 16, 2015. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with di sabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of its supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule and a nontechnical explan ation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: These rules apply to the Judges' Retirement Fund (JRF). The changes are proposed in anticipation of seeking for the JRF a determination letter of qualified status from the IRS. They are also designed to amend the rules in certain areas so that the language tracks the language in the rules for the PERSI Base Plan. That tracking will make for easier and consistent administration and may also lessen the need for future revisions. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Sections 67-5226(1)(b) and (c) Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate for the following reasons: To ensure the rules meet federal requirements, thereby lessening risk to qualified status (which benefits all members and beneficiaries and employers). FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: None. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if app licable, of any negative fi scal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: NA NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(2), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because negotiated rulemaking is not feasible because it would be inconsistent with the Retirement Board's exclusive fiduciary responsibility for plan operations and because several of the changes are required by federal law for qualified plan status. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: Pursuant to Section 67-5229(2)(a), Idaho Code, the following is a brief synopsis of why the materials cited are being incorporated by reference into this rule: NAASSISTANCE ON TECHNICAL QUESTIONS, SUBMISSION OF WRITTEN COMMENTS: For assistance on technical questions concerning the temporary and proposed rule, contact Joanna L.
