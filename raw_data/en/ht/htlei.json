Introduction [1](#B1-separations-10-00177)]. They are rich in bioactive substances, which offer physiological advantages, and help prevent and treat diseases. Herbal nutraceuticals are foods prepared from plants and/or their oils, roots, seeds, berries, or flowers that support wellness and combat acute and chronic ailments caused by unhealthful eating habits. Many ancient cultures had a strong belief in the use of herbs for both sustenance and medicine [ [2](#B2-separations-10-00177)]. Societies in India and China have historically employed a variety of plant compounds that are thought to have medicinal properties. Nutraceuticals has developed from its traditional roots to become a highly specialized scientific industry where the effectiveness and safety of the products are supported by data, recent research, and cutting-edge technological advancements ( [Figure 1](#separations-10-00177-f001)) [ [1](#B1-separations-10-00177)]. Strategy of Searching Articles 2. Sources of Bioactive Compounds (Herbs) 2.1. Aloe Vera [3](#B3-separations-10-00177)]. Some of the components and E, -carotene, B1, B2, B3, B6, choline, B12, folic acid. and antioxidant properties a recent study on the anticancer properties of aloe-emodin, an anthraquinone bioactive compound from aloe vera leaf, reported a notable efficacy of the extract against lymphoblastic leukemia cells in comparison to the standard drugs in clinical usage [ [5](#B5-separations-10-00177), [6](#B6-separations-10-00177)]. Antidiabetic evaluation by Huseini et al. proposes that aloe vera gel can be potentially employed as an anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hypercholesterolemic agent with positive outcomes on blood glucose and lipid levels [ [7](#B7-separations-10-00177)]. 2.2. Angelica [3](#B3-separations-10-00177), [5](#B5-separations-10-00177)]. 2.3. Anise [3](#B3-separations-10-00177), [6](#B6-separations-10-00177)]. In antibacterial, anticonvulsant, gastro-protective, [10](#B10-separations-10-00177)]. antidiarrheal, and anti-diabetic potencies of bay leaf extracts have been proposed by several authors [ [3](#B3-separations-10-00177), [7](#B7-separations-10-00177)]. 2.6. Bayberry [12](#B12-separations-10-00177)]. Bayberry fruit is considered to be a rich source of cyanidin-3-glucoside, accounting for 85% of anthocyanins in the fruit [ [13](#B13-separations-10-00177)]. It is used in the treatment sore throat, vaginal discharge, colitis, wounds, ulcers, headache, colds, nausea, and diarrhea, and can also enhance systemic circulation [ [3](#B3-separations-10-00177), [8](#B8-separations-10-00177)]. 2.7. Bee components from this plant species have been reported to harbor significant antifungal potencies, with highest activity against Trichophyton mentagrophytes the major bioactive components in zedoary. This traditional medicinal plant was evidenced to have strong anti-proliferation and anti-metastatic activities against esophageal cancer TE-8 cells and was also found to be effectually hostile to tumor formation [ [15](#B15-separations-10-00177)]. has also implicated many of its bioactive principles as potent antioxidants, and anti-inflammatory, anti-mutagenic, antimicrobial, the hepatoprotective role of savory in treating cisplatin-induced liver injury in rats. They reported that the beneficial effects of savory (Satureja hortensis L.) extract were similar to silymarin, a known natural hepatoprotective drug [ [17](#B17-separations-10-00177)]. Although the herb exhibits its own medicinal profile, the traditional culinary applications are well known among different populations. The dried leaves are greenish brown in color, aromatic, and have a mildly warm and sharp flavor. Many meals, especially chicken and stuffings, can be flavored with the dried leaves and flowering tops of savory. 2.23. major plant sources of bioactive components and their physiological relevance. 3. Extraction of Bioactive Compounds [36](#B36-separations-10-00177)]. During traditional times, extracts were prepared by boiling either the specific plant parts, such as leaves, root, flower, or the whole plant in water [ [37](#B37-separations-10-00177)]. This process was both time consuming and inefficient. It should be noted that selection of the appropriate extraction techniques is crucial as it greatly affects the final product obtained [ [38](#B38-separations-10-00177)]. Below, we list the various state-of-the-art extraction methodologies, which are both time-efficient and effective. 3.1. Soxhlet Extraction [38](#B38-separations-10-00177), [39](#B39-separations-10-00177)]. 3.2. Ultrasound-Assisted Extraction (UAE) [40](#B40-separations-10-00177)]. Discoursed specifics reveal that acoustic cavitation and sonoporation, which are pivotal in the extraction process, are aligned towards the uniformity of source samples. Uniformity of the cellular matrix leads to the uniformity in the pore formation due to cavitation and thereby helps in the effectual release of bioactive components from the matrix [ [41](#B41-separations-10-00177), [42](#B42-separations-10-00177)]. [43](#B43-separations-10-00177)]. It was reported that 20% higher yield of polyphenols was obtained from Salvia officinalis with much less sample consumption and 3-fold lower processing time using UAE. Nano emulsion of anise extracts formulated using the ultrasound assisted technique was found to be effective against most of the tested pathogens and exhibited a more notable antimicrobial activity than the bulk extract [ [43](#B43-separations-10-00177), [44](#B44-separations-10-00177)]. The disadvantage lies in the fact that both yield and kinetics of extraction largely depend on the nature of the plant matrix. Moreover, the active part of the ultrasound waves may be restricted to areas around the ultrasonic emitter only. In addition, optimization of the solvent composition, appropriate agitation, input power, and right time is the major factor that determines the efficiency of the method [ [45](#B45-separations-10-00177), [46](#B46-separations-10-00177)]. 3.3. Microwave-Assisted Extraction (MAE) [47](#B47-separations-10-00177), [48](#B48-separations-10-00177)]. For example, the MAE separation technique has conveniently and effectively been used to isolate the polyphenols including aloe-emodin, aloin A, aloin B, aloeresin D, from the aloe vera sample [ [49](#B49-separations-10-00177), [50](#B50-separations-10-00177)]. Authors involved in this study also noted the importance of the different parameters, such as extraction time, temperature, solvent volume on the extraction yield, and bioactive component quantity [ [51](#B51-separations-10-00177)]. [52](#B52-separations-10-00177)]. Another advantage when compared with the conventional heating process is its energy efficiency. The disadvantages are that it is not appropriate for extraction of non-polar compounds or temperature-sensitive compounds and is incompatible with highly viscous solvents [ [53](#B53-separations-10-00177), [54](#B54-separations-10-00177)]. The efficiency of MAE depends upon several parameters including the properties of the solvents and compound (dielectric constants, polarity, solubility, partition coefficient, mass diffusivity, and volumes of the extracting solvent and sample), microwave power, frequency and duration of irradiation, extraction pressure, and the number of cycles [ [55](#B55-separations-10-00177), [56](#B56-separations-10-00177)]. 3.4. Supercritical Fluid Extraction (SFE) [57](#B57-separations-10-00177)]. On the other hand, lower pressures of parsley fruit extracts comprised mainly of the phenylpropene, apiole, were reported to have stronger antibacterial effects [ [58](#B58-separations-10-00177)]. [39](#B39-separations-10-00177), [45](#B45-separations-10-00177)]. One of other major drawbacks of using supercritical CO2 is its lipophilicity and non-polar nature, which can be resolved by using modifiers or co-solvents, such as methanol. Interestingly, SFE can be used in the extraction of carotenoids from tomatoes and to separate lycopene from it by coupling it with supercritical fluid chromatography [ [59](#B59-separations-10-00177), [60](#B60-separations-10-00177)]. 3.5. Accelerated 3.6. Hydro-Distillation Extraction [61](#B61-separations-10-00177)]. Hydro-diffusion, hydrolysis, and heat decomposition are the processes involved in this methodology. This process cannot be employed in the extraction of thermo-labile compounds [ [62](#B62-separations-10-00177), [63](#B63-separations-10-00177)]. The process is carried out in an apparatus called the Clevenger apparatus. When heat or direct steam is applied, the sample solvent mixture placed in a closed chamber vaporizes, and the vapor causes bursting of small sacs containing essential oils. Upon condensation, oils are separated from the water by a density-based separator. The process should be done within a specific duration to ensure complete extraction of oil components. 3.7. Ultra High-Pressure Extraction (UPE) [65](#B65-separations-10-00177)]. 3.8. Enzyme-Assisted Extraction (EAE) [66](#B66-separations-10-00177)]. Similarly, notable enhancement of extraction yield was reported by enzyme-assisted extraction of curcumin from turmeric using a mixture of -amylase and amyloglucosidase enzymes [ [67](#B67-separations-10-00177)]. [68](#B68-separations-10-00177)]. 3.9. Pulse Electric Field Extraction (PEF) [69](#B69-separations-10-00177)]. 4. Purification and Characterization of Bioactive Compounds [64](#B64-separations-10-00177), [70](#B70-separations-10-00177)]. 4.1. Ultrafiltration [71](#B71-separations-10-00177)]. Because ultrafiltration requires less energy than thermal separation techniques, it may be a desirable concentration alternative in many applications [ [72](#B72-separations-10-00177)]. 4.2. Bioaffinity Chromatography (BAC) [73](#B73-separations-10-00177)]. The difference in analyte retention periods on the chromatographic columns is the foundation of the traditional BAC mode. However, most of the natural product extracts contain lower concentrations of the biologically significant compound. Here, solid phase extraction becomes significant [ [74](#B74-separations-10-00177)]. Immobilized enzyme reactors (IMERs) can be employed when enzymes are being used as the target. They can simultaneously assess the bioactivity of natural product extracts by measuring changes in enzyme activity [ [75](#B75-separations-10-00177)]. 4.3. Cell Membrane Chromatography (CMC) [21](#B21-separations-10-00177)]. CMC rapidly screens complicated samples based on the affinity between a phytomedicine and a membrane receptor. As a result, CMC offers an efficient analytical technique for target identification in complicated samples, drug quality control, drug mechanism research, and new drug discovery [ [76](#B76-separations-10-00177)]. 4.4. Ligand Fishing [71](#B71-separations-10-00177)]. The majority of ligand fishing techniques exhibit great efficiency, specificity, and minimal sample pretreatment, which makes them particularly well-suited for identifying active ingredients in complicated mixtures of natural materials. The two types of ligand fishing techniques are online and offline. Active substances that have been trapped on the stationary phase by immobilized biomolecules, such as metabolites, enzymes, or receptors must first be rinsed off before being analyzed in the off-line mode. After the bio-extraction process, the incubated sample solution is directly examined by chromatographic methods in on-line mode, and the active components in the mixture can be inferred inferentially by comparing the chromatograms of the original sample [ [77](#B77-separations-10-00177)]. 5. Herbal Nutraceuticals in Market [Table 2](#separations-10-00177-t002)). Consumers may be young adults who are into sports, muscle building, and toning of the body that requires the consumption of protein and other supplements. Dietitians also recommend the use of certain nutraceuticals for their therapeutic effect on various diseases, diabetes, kidney disorders, anemia etc. According to the growing market, there is a high demand for fat burners, multivitamins, and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA). The main category of nutraceuticals are organic foods, which are particularly prominent in the increasing population leading sedentary lifestyles [ [78](#B78-separations-10-00177)]. This field is further anticipated to bring new products based on the customer interests. The global nutraceuticals market in 2016 was valued at approximately USD 383 billion and by 2022 it is expected to reach USD 561 billion [ [79](#B79-separations-10-00177)]. The herbal and dietary supplement industry is said to have an estimated growth of USD 50 billion in countries such as USA and Canada. The growth in dietary supplements is estimated to increase 19.5% and that of herbal products to 11.6%. To meet the increasing demands of proper diet and healthy nutrition, foods are set to become more attractive and fortified in order to eradicate malnutrition in the coming future [ [80](#B80-separations-10-00177)]. Thus, the Indian nutraceuticals market was expected to show an increase of 20% by 2020 with sale values up to USD 6.4 billion. While, India constitutes only 2% of the global nutraceutical products based on the per capita spent as per the report of Assocham, functional foods such as beverages including antioxidant supplements may elicit increased demand in the Indian market [ [78](#B78-separations-10-00177)]. 6. Functional Properties of the Nutraceuticals [81](#B81-separations-10-00177)]. Indeed, due to their potential for both nutrition and treatment, nutraceuticals are currently receiving a lot of attention. Herbal nutraceuticals aid in promoting and sustaining good health as well as extending life expectancy and improving the quality of life ( [Figure 2](#separations-10-00177-f002)). Numerous disorders, including cancer, neurological diseases, and cardiovascular diseases, can be treated using nutraceuticals, as per research. 6.1. Diabetes [82](#B82-separations-10-00177)]. Genistein, an essential nutraceutical molecule present in soybean seeds, has been discovered to be an effective drug for managing diabetes. According to in vitro investigations, genistein boosted insulin secretion in a mouse pancreatic beta-cell line, MIN-6 cells; and in cultured islets from mice and rats [ [83](#B83-separations-10-00177)]. In a human study, genistein treatment improved insulin sensitivity scores in postmenopausal women. A daily dose of 54 mg of the compound raised glucose tolerance and improved insulin sensitivity while lowering fasting blood sugar [ [84](#B84-separations-10-00177)]. According to an animal study, grape seed proanthocyanidin extracts can considerably lower blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetic rats [ [85](#B85-separations-10-00177)]. However, proanthocyanidins isolated from the rhizome of Fagopyrum grape seed proanthocyanidins in anti-diabetic action [ [86](#B86-separations-10-00177)]. In several nations, diabetics have been reported to be treated using sage (Salvia officinalis). Salvia officinalis extract is demonstrated to have anti-diabetic properties, which can be attributed to its ability to activate the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) officinalis) is well-known in India for its medicinal properties. E. officinalis consumption reduced liver triacylglycerol and cholesterol levels. It reduces oxidative stress by reversing hyperlipidemia associated with aging. Additionally, studies show that oral delivery of amla results in significant drop in total cholesterol (TC). It was also found to increase the levels of high-density lipoprotein [ [89](#B89-separations-10-00177)]. Salvia officinalis L. has shown significant pancreatic lipase inhibition and a considerable reduction in serum triglyceride levels, resulting in robust beneficial effects on body weight and obesity [ [90](#B90-separations-10-00177)]. An animal study proposed that activating TRPV1 channels with dietary capsaicin may result in browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) to combat obesity [ [91](#B91-separations-10-00177)]. Additionally, dietary capsaicin diminishes the risk for hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance brought on by obesity in mice [ [92](#B92-separations-10-00177)]. In in vitro tests, it was discovered that green tea extract AR25 (Exolise) exerted a direct inhibition of stomach and pancreatic lipases and an activation of thermogenesis, making it a suitable natural product for the treatment of obesity [ [93](#B93-separations-10-00177)]. 6.3. Immunomodulation [94](#B94-separations-10-00177)]. Numerous studies conducted over the past two decades have revealed that curcumin with a variety of biological targets, exerts its anti-inflammatory actions by suppressing the expression of inflammatory transcription factors (such as NF-B), enzymes (such as cyclooxygenases, COX-2 and thymol, and carvacrol have also been investigated and found to increase the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin IL-10, while decreasing in vitro [ [96](#B96-separations-10-00177)]. 6.4. Dementia [97](#B97-separations-10-00177)]. Sage boosts memory in both young and old people, and a randomized controlled experiment demonstrates its positive cognitive and behavioral effects [ [98](#B98-separations-10-00177)]. Traditional Chinese medicine has employed the moss Huperzia serrata to treat and prevent dementia. It has huperzine A, an effective anti-AChE alkaloid with prominent neuroprotective properties [ [99](#B99-separations-10-00177)]. Caffeine from coffee is a neuroprotective that can potentially reverse memory loss, lower brain beta-amyloid levels in vivo, and can stimulate the central nervous system [ [100](#B100-separations-10-00177)]. Lesser periwinkle (Vinca minor L.) has been shown to enhance blood flow to the brain, and vinpocetine, a synthetic vincamine alkaloid derivative, has been shown to elicit significant neuroprotective qualities. Vinpocetine has also produced some encouraging clinical trial results with regards to cognitive improvement in dementia patients. Indeed, the major metabolite of vinpocetine, cis-apovincaminic acid (cAVA), has multimodal neuroprotective effects [ [101](#B101-separations-10-00177)]. 6.5. Hypertension [102](#B102-separations-10-00177)]. Ginger used as a supplement has a considerable beneficial impact on endothelial function and blood pressure [ [103](#B103-separations-10-00177)]. Adding ginger to the diet in amounts of 2-6 g/day has been suggested to significantly lower blood pressure [ [104](#B104-separations-10-00177)]. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) and cholesterol levels are also reduced. Additionally, ginger provides a lot of potassium, which is crucial for controlling blood pressure [ [105](#B105-separations-10-00177)]. Recent investigations have shown that saffron's antioxidant and radical scavenger actions underlie its cardioprotective qualities [ [106](#B106-separations-10-00177)]. In hypertensive rats, saffron (200 mg/kg/day) supplementation for five weeks can prevent blood pressure increases and induce aortic remodeling [ [107](#B107-separations-10-00177)]. Cinnamon is also useful in treating heart disease, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. It has been shown to lower blood pressure and glucose levels in rodent models [ [108](#B108-separations-10-00177)]. In addition, cinnamon's polyphenols help improve insulin sensitivity, which is implicated in blood pressure regulation [ [109](#B109-separations-10-00177)]. 6.6. Antimicrobial Activity [110](#B110-separations-10-00177)]. The antibacterial activity decidua) bark was tested against respiratory-tract pathogens in a study, and the results show that larch bark extract (LBE) had stronger antimicrobial activity than grapefruit seed extract. LBE phytochemicals can therefore be employed as active antibacterials in nutraceutical formulations [ [111](#B111-separations-10-00177)]. Quercetin is a flavonoid found primarily in vegetables and fruits that has antiviral, anti-atopic, pro-metabolic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Quercetin's ability to interfere with SARS-CoV-2 replication has been demonstrated using computer modeling in a study aimed at the discovery of candidate chemicals displaying potential efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 viral targets [ [112](#B112-separations-10-00177)]. In a broad-spectrum activity evaluation of diverse nutraceutical plant extracts, Psidium guajava demonstrated the best antibacterial activity and may be a promising candidate in the quest for effective and efficient antimicrobial agents [ [113](#B113-separations-10-00177)]. In vitro tests of Thymus vulgaris essential oil demonstrated very significant bactericidal and antifungal activity, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 75 to 1100 g/mL and 80 and 97 g/mL, respectively. The plant could therefore be regarded as another appropriate natural source for nutraceutical formulations. It can also be used in conjunction with antibiotics as a synergistic agent or as a natural antibacterial and fungicidal [ [114](#B114-separations-10-00177)]. Apigenin, a compound found in Berberine, found in medicinal plants including Coptis chinensis may lower plasma lipids by decreasing the production of hepatic cholesterol and triglycerides, potentially by activating AMP-activated protein kinase, then inactivates -hydroxy -methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase [ [117](#B117-separations-10-00177)]. Human blood lipid concentrations and soy protein intake were compared in a meta-analysis of 38 subjects in a controlled clinical trial study. The findings showed that consuming soy protein as opposed to animal protein significantly reduced serum levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol without significantly influencing levels of HDL cholesterol [ [118](#B118-separations-10-00177)]. The effects of the herbal drink derived from the plant tiwai (Eleutherine americana Merr.) on individuals with hypercholesterolemia's lipid profiles were examined in a clinical trial. According to the findings, consuming tiwai herbal drink for seven days could lower total cholesterol by 5.33 mg/dL compared to the control [ [119](#B119-separations-10-00177)]. Meta-analysis has also been performed to evaluate the effects of tree nuts on blood lipids. As per the findings, eating tree nuts reduces triglycerides, apolipoprotein B (ApoB), LDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol. Further, nut dose, not the nut type, appears to be the main factor in decreasing cholesterol [ [120](#B120-separations-10-00177)]. 7. Negative Impact of Herbal Nutraceuticals [121](#B121-separations-10-00177)]. Unfortunately, the notion that herbal dietary products are natural and safe in all doses, and the lack of information regarding the composition of these supplements have led people to adopt detrimental self-medication regimens. This inappropriate use of supplements can lead to several toxicities, such as hepatotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, Hepatotoxicity [123](#B123-separations-10-00177)]. Hepatotoxicity is mainly caused due to the presence of compounds, such as pyrrolizidine alkaloids of comfrey, I It is observable as hepatocellular, cholestasis, or a mix of both patterns, which are similar to the injury caused by drug overuse. The frequency of liver injury is higher in patients using HDS than the conventional medications according to some prospective and retrospective studies. The need for liver transplantation is more evidently seen in liver injury caused by HDS [ [124](#B124-separations-10-00177)]. There is a broad spectrum of clinical characteristics that result from liver toxicity due to HDS, which includes autoimmune disorders, cirrhosis, hepatic fibrosis, necrosis, and cholestasis. Young and middle-aged patients with HDS-linked hepatotoxicity are more prevalent since they consume certain HDS to burn fat, lose weight, and as body building supplements. HDS-associated hepatotoxicity can vary from mild liver injury to severe acute liver failure. Furthermore, 88% of patients in the US Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) network showed mild to moderate severity whereas severe to fatal conditions were elicited by 12% of the respondents. Most patients were female in the age range of 48 to 53 [ [124](#B124-separations-10-00177)]. 7.2. Pulmonary Toxicity [121](#B121-separations-10-00177)]. An 11-membered pyrrolizidine alkaloid identified as monocrotaline (MCT) has been evidenced to cause pulmonary disorders, which include vascular syndrome with pulmonary vasculitis and hypertension in rats. The pathogenesis of MCT-induced pulmonary toxicity is hypothesized based on suggestions that MCT becomes a reactive compound in the liver which is then transported in the blood to reach and cause injury to endothelial cells of the lung [ [125](#B125-separations-10-00177)]. 7.3. Carcinogenicity [126](#B126-separations-10-00177)]. Another herbal medicine called comfrey contains 14 pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which may cause carcinogenicity in experimental animals. Studies suggest that certain phytochemicals potentially interact with the genetic material of the endothelial cells and induce cancer development [ [127](#B127-separations-10-00177)]. 7.4. Nephrotoxicity [128](#B128-separations-10-00177)]. 7.5. Cardiac Toxicity [129](#B129-separations-10-00177)]. 8. Safety, Quality and Regulatory Aspects of Herbal Nutraceuticals [130](#B130-separations-10-00177)]. Such herbal remedies are classified as food supplements by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and have different regulations when compared to the laws governing conventional foods and drugs. Unlike the market drugs, herbal and dietary supplements do not undergo the stringent FDA drug approval process. Only supplements that are adulterated or misbranded are prohibited by the FDA from being marketed. Since 2004, around half of the class 1 drugs have been recalled as they were found to be adulterated dietary supplements contaminated with banned ingredients. Studies on safety, efficacy, and scientific evidence of such products are very limited and little incentive is given by the government for conducting varied and randomized controlled trials. Therefore, there is no legal provision that allows the FDA to examine and sanction herbal supplements. Some frequently used supplements that are known to produce mild to severe side effects are echinacea, garlic, ginkgo, and St. John's wort, which can lead to detrimental interactions between herbal products and drugs [ [131](#B131-separations-10-00177)]. [132](#B132-separations-10-00177)]. [124](#B124-separations-10-00177)]. Herbal supplements are regulated and monitored in the European Union (EU) under the Traditional Herbals Medicine Products Directive 2004/24/EC. Following this regulation, only if a product has been proven to be used safely for a sufficient amount of time of over 30 years with 15 years of use within the EU, can it be registered through a simple process and may not necessitate any medical prescription. The European Food Safety Authority (AFSA) regulates vitamins and mineral food supplements according to Directive 2002/46/EC while the Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products (HMPC) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) monitors herbal medicinal products. However, many dietary supplements can be bought online without proper legal clearance which makes its more complicated to correctly identify the manufacturers [ [133](#B133-separations-10-00177)].
