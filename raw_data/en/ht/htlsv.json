Cosgrove , MD, FAAP Merritt Island, FL Documenting Parental Refusal to Have Their Children Vaccinated All parents and patients should be informed about the risks and benefits of preventive and therapeutic procedures, including vaccination. In the case of vaccination, the American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP) strongly recommends and federal law mandates that t his discussion include the provision of the Vacc ine Information Statements (VISs). Despite our best efforts to educate parents about the effectiveness of vaccines and the realistic chances of vaccine-associated adverse events, some will decline to have their children vaccinated. This often results from families misinterpreting or misunderstanding information presented by the media and on unmonitored and biased Web sites, causing substantial and often unrealistic fears. Within a 12-month period, 74% of pediatricians report encountering a parent who refused or delayed one or more vaccines. A 2011 survey of children six months to six years of age reported that 13% of parents followed an alternative vaccination schedule. Of these, 53% refused certain vaccines and 55% delayed some vaccines until the child was older. Seventeen percent reported refusing all vaccines. In a 2009 survey, 11.5% of parents of children 17 years and younger reported refusing at least one vaccine. The use of this or a similar form in concert with direct and non - condescending discussion can demonstrate the importance you place on appropr iate immunizations, focuses parents' attention on the unnecessary risk for which they are accepting responsibility, and may in some instances induce a wavering parent to acc ept your recommendations. Providing parents (or guardians) with an oppor tunity to ask questions about their concerns regarding recommended childhood immunizations, attempting to understand parents' reasons for refusing one or more vaccines, and maintaining a suppor tive relationship with the family are all part of a good risk management strategy. The AAP encourages documentation of the health care provider's discussion with parents about the serious risks of what could happen to an unimmunized or under-immunized child. Provide parents with the appropr iate VIS for each vaccine at each immunization visit and answer their questions. For parents who refuse one or more recommended immunizations, document your conversation and the provision of the VIS(s), have a parent sign the Refusal to Vaccinate form, and keep the form in the patient's medical record. The AAP also recommends that you revisit the immunization discussion at each subsequent appointment and carefully document the discussion, including the benefits to each immunization and the risk of not being age-appropriately immunized. For unimmunized or partially immunized children, some physicians may want to flag the chart to be reminded to revisit the immunization discussion, as well as to ale rt the provider about missed immunizations when considering the evaluation of future illness, especial ly young children with fevers of unknown origin. This form may be used as a template to document that the health care provider had a discussion with the parent signing the form about the risks of failing to immunize the child. It is not intended as a substitute for legal advice from a qualified attorney as differing state laws and factual circumstances will impact the outcome. While it may be modified to reflect the particular circumstances of a patient, family, or medical practice, practices may want to consider obtaining advice from a qualified attorney. If a parent refuses to sign the refusal form such refusal along with the name of a witness to the refusal should be documented in the medical record. The AAP Secti on on Infectious Diseases and other contributing sections and committees hope this form will be helpful to you as you deal with parents who refuse immunizations. It is available on the AAP Web site on the Secti on on Infectious Diseases Web site (http://www2.aap.org/sections/infectdis/resources.cfm ), and the Web site for the AAP Childhood Immunization Support Program (http://www2.aap.org/immunization/pediatricians/refusaltovaccinate.html ).

I have had the opportunity to discuss the recommendation and my refusal with my child's doctor or nurse, who has answered all of my questions about the recom-mended vaccine(s). A list of reasons for vaccinating, possible health consequences of non-vaccination, and possible side effects of each vaccine is available at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/vis/default.htm. I understand the following: nThe purpose of and the need for the recommended vaccine(s). nThe risks and benefits of the recommended vaccine(s).nThat some vaccine-preventable diseases are common in other countries and that my unvaccinated child could easily get one of these diseases while traveling or from a traveler. nIf my child does not receive the vaccine(s) according to the medically accepted schedule, the consequences may include -Contracting the illness the vaccine is designed to prevent (the outcomes of these illnesses may include one or more of the following: certain types of cancer, pneumonia, illness requiring hospitalization, death, brain damage, paralysis, meningitis, seizures, and deafness; other severe and pe rmanent effects from these vaccine-preventable diseases are possible as well). -Transmitting the disease to others (including those too young to be vaccinated or those with immune problems), possibly requiring my child to stay out of child care or school and requiring someone to miss work to stay home with my child during disease outbreaks. nMy child's doctor and the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention all strongly recommend that the vaccine(s) be given according to recommendations. Nevertheless, I have decided at this time to decline or defer the vaccine(s) recommended for my child, as indicated above, by check - ing the appropriate box under the column titled \"Declined.\" I know that failure to follow the recommendations about vaccination may endanger the health or life of my child and others with whom my child might come into contact. I therefore agree to tell all health care professionals in all settings what vaccines my child has not received because he or she may need to be isolated or may require immediate medical evaluation and tests that might not be necessary if my child had been vaccinated. I know that I may readdress this issue with my child's doctor or nurse at any time and that I may change my mind and accept vaccination for my child any time in the future. I acknowledge that I have read this document in its entirety and fully understand it.My child's doctor/nurse, , has advised me that my child (named above) should receive the following vaccines:Copyright \u00a9 2013 9-80/0119Parental Refusal to Accept Vaccination: Resources for Pediatricians The following are some of the resources available to help pediatricians develop a productive dialogue with vaccine-hesitant parents and answer questions about vaccine risks and benefits: Web Sites 1.
