The essence of Native American culture is the concept that everything is spiritual. We work side-by-side with our guests to reconnect their spirit to all things around them. At Royal Life Detox, we believe that spiritual healing is as important to the recovery process as mental or physical healing. The Opportunity to Heal Tribal Members As one of [Royal Life Centers' Wellbriety-certified Tribal Healing programs](https://royallifecenters.com/tribal-healing/), we at Royal Life Detox are dedicated to providing compassionate care for those who seek our help has extended to reach tribal members who deserve a full opportunity to experience a life of sobriety built on their cultural beliefs and foundation of values. It is our mission and our honor to serve these men and women as they take on a new journey toward sobriety and beyond. We believe that tribal members deserve the pinnacle of care, and as such, we treat them as our own family. Tribal Treatment Groups On top of the various treatment groups hosted at Royal Life Detox, such as art and music therapy, our tribal guests have the opportunity to join special groups geared directly toward tribal healing. These groups include drum circles, Native Holistic Recovery, bead and drum crafting, and even trips to a local sweat lodge - transportation provided. We believe that this is pivotal in truly embracing recovery in a manner that respects the culture of our tribal guests. Mending Broken Hearts Mending Broken Hearts is a special certification obtained from the White Bison and Wellbriety Movement training course. Mending Broken Hearts focuses on an approach to addressing intergenerational trauma for the purpose of healing - in direct relation to tribal members. This certification teaches about the trauma from stripping away the culture, interconnectedness, elders' teachings, spirituality, language, values, and ceremonies from Native Americans. Historically, this trauma occurred generations ago, as a consequence of the mission and boarding schools that the Native American youth were forced into. This shift resulted in an extreme emotional wound - the taking away of identity and values, having tribal languages silenced, and even the direst cases, sexual and physical abuse. The pain from this damage is still felt seven generations later by the majority of tribal men and women. We are committed to breaking this cycle and doing our part to aid in the healing process. Some of the biggest roadblocks to addiction treatment for Native Americans are addressing this intergenerational trauma which has resulted in generations of substance abuse and addiction and generations of shame. We use the knowledge from this training to address the very real and ever-present root emotions of anger, guilt, shame, and fear\u2014 so that we can make room for healing. It is our mission to help mend the wound that was caused in any way that we can. The Medicine Wheel and 12-Step In tribal culture, the medicine wheel is a sacred symbol that represents healing and health. Often, the medicine wheel is regarded as a representation of all the knowledge of the universe. This is a true symbol of hope and healing for those who seek it. The exact meaning of the medicine wheel's symbolism can vary from tribe to tribe, as it is up to their own interpretation. The wheel has four directions: north, east, south, and west. Each of these directions is a marker for many other attributes of that section of the medicine wheel. It also is represented by four colors: black, red, yellow, and white. In addition, the four directions can represent: - Stages of Life - Birth, Youth, Adult, Death - Aspects of Life - Spiritual, Physical, Emotional, Intellectual - Natural Elements - Fire, Earth, Air, Water - Seasons - Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall - Ceremonial Plants - Sweetgrass, Tobacco, Cedar, Sage - Sacred Animals - Eagle, Bear, Buffalo, Wolf The Medicine Wheel and 12-step Program is another certification that is focused on healing the pain in tribal communities (hurt, violence, suicide, the impact of addiction, etc.). This provides a program geared specifically to model a 12-step approach that has a foundation in tribal culture. This adjusted 12-step program is based on teachings of the medicine wheel, the cycle of life, the Four Laws of Change, and ceremonial practice. This includes culture, tradition, and values into a 12-step approach. It has proven to be the missing piece for many tribal members who need more of a tailored approach to a traditional 12-step program of recovery.
