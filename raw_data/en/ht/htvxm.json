TDAP PROS AND CONS . [20+ Similar Discussions Found](//www.whattoexpect.com/search?tab=community&q=TDAP+PROS+AND+CONS) Pros: your baby will not be at risk for deadly whooping cough My first daughter was born 4 weeks after my TDAP vaccine (vaccinated at 29 weeks, born at 33 weeks). I don't attribute it to the vaccine, and she does not have autism. I get your fear, but I don't think what you experienced is related. My oldest son has autism and my second son does not. I had Tdap and flu shot with both of them. I was reading how they think autism is caused in the second trimester. Vaccines don't cause autism. They don't cause it. But I've read somewhere certain ones can cause deficiencies of nutrients in the body that prevent the brain from getting the proper development it needs....which then leads to the diagnosis of autism. But you never know. it makes no sense that the brain would be nutrient deficient. wouldn't the rest of the baby's body be deficient as well and the organs would be developmentally behind? Im very pro vaccine but ive been on the fence about the tdap shot too, im really not sure exactly why though. Also Vaccines dont cause autism. . Thank you! I work in the field. Scientifically it's been disproven multiple times over that there is no connection to autism and vaccines. Even if there were your child can't die from autism but they can from everything they need vaccines for. My high risk OB doesn't do any vaccinations during pregnancy because he says any drug you can avoid taking is better than loading your body up too much, and there are risks with everything. If you have fears, don't do it. You'll be second guessing yourself forever. You can always get it in hospital after you deliver if you still want it anyway.. my OB has said that is his preference. Also, there is some evidence that the trap is correlated with premi birth and higher rates of still birth. I don't have any hard core evidence, but it is a known correlation-not neccesarily causation but there is some statistical links. Personally, I'd avoid until after birth given your story. But you won't get any/many agreements on this forum, it is heavily pro vacc, I'm sorry chick. Don't let yourself be forced into something that makes you uncomfortable. Good luck! xoxox My doctor gave me the option to do all vaccines when I'm in labor/after delivery. I'm planning on doing that this won't offer your baby any protection, so it doesn't make any sense.... The biggest pro for getting the vaccine while you're pregnant is that your baby will be born with antibodies against whooping cough which is terrifying with a tiny baby. My son didn't get sick but both of my nieces did when they were less than 3 months old. I got the tdap and carried my son full term. I understand your fear, but it was probably just coincidental. Take the two weeks to really weigh it out. You'll make the best decision for you. Whooping cough is deadly only in the first 2 months, before baby is able to really cough. Keep baby at home and skip the shot what a load of bull This is not accurate at all. It says right in the insert it's not recommended for pregnant women or children under 5 I believe .... Pro: protects your infant from dying from whooping cough. Con: none. I didn't get it with my first and I'm not getting it this time around. I don't feel like it's necessary to put that junk in my body when like the other poster commented saying it's only the first two months. Stay home with baby and skip the shot. My first never even got a cold yet.. perfectly healthy You May Also Like [PregnancyYour Guide to the Second Trimester of Pregnancy](//www.whattoexpect.com/second-trimester-of-pregnancy.aspx) [PregnancyYour Pregnancy Week-by-Week](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/week-by-week/) [GeneralLearn About What to Expect's BabiesTdap vaccineJuly 19, 2023 | by bulldawg17Any pros or cons to getting the tdap vaccine?
