Originally from Toronto, Dr. Shiff completed her undergraduate degree at the University of British Columbia, following which she attended medical school at the University of Calgary and undertook her residency in Pediatrics at Memorial Un iversity in Newfoundland. Natalie completed a Pediatric Rheumatology subspecialty residency at BC Children's Hospital and then a Masters of Health Scie nces Degree also at UBC. Natalie has a particular interest in health services research, which she recognizes to be a critical component of effective healthcare. Dr. Shiff recently received a Saskatchewan Health Research Foundation New Investigator Award for a project titled: Validation of Administrative Data Diagnoses of Chronic Childhood Arthritis in Saskatchewan. Dr. Shiff is involved in local and national pediatric rheumatology research studies. She is the University of Sa skatchewan's representative for an international registry of nervous system vasculitis (Brainworks) and a North American vasculitis outcome study (ARCHIVe). She is our representative on a CIHR Team Grant studying relationships between juvenile arthritis and physical activity (The LEAP Study; Linking Exercise, Arthritis and Pathophysiology). Dr. Shiff is also involved in leading the reporting of results from a nationwide juvenile arthritis outcome study. Additionally, she is leading a study examining the effects of corticosteroids on body mass index in children treated with these medications for their rheumatic disease. This is part of a national study investigating effects of these drugs on bone development (the STOPP-CIS study; the Steroid Induced Osteoporosis in the Pediatric Population Canadian Incidence Study).

Please let us know of pediatric research projects at the U of S that are making a difference. Department of Pediatrics Newslet ter NovemberDecember 2011 - 6 - Two graduate student studies focussing on juvenile arthritis took top honours at the Canadian Arthritis Network Annual Scientific Conference in Quebec City. The U of S repr esentatives won two of the four categories for poster pres entations at the conference where more than 170 abstracts were presented. While most of the presentations related to adult rheumatology, both of these projects had a pediatric focus. Dr. Tracy Wilson- Gerwing , a post-doctoral fellow, in association with Drs. David Cooper, Tawni Silver and Alan Rosenberg presented her research titled: Differences Between Juvenile and Adult Rodents in a Model of Experimental Arthritis. The presentation won top honours in the Immunology and Inflammation Category. There are apparent differences between adult and childhood arthritis. Differences include the observations that children's bones are still growing and their immune system is not yet mature. Unfortunately, until now, basic science research into arthritis interventions have treated children and adults with arthritis as equals. The current research serves to correct this oversight and demonstrates that, in an experimental model of arthritis, juveniles and adults respond differently. Preliminary data demonstrate distinct differences between juvenile and adult rodents with arthritis. Juveniles developed arthritis earlier than their adult counterparts, had a shorter time to onset of the second paw, and spent fewer days with a Maximal Daily Arthritis Score. Overall, juveniles coped better with the arthritis than did the adults. Bone scans (micro computed tomography, digital x-ray and ultrasound) and tissue scans (ultrasound) al so indicated differences between the degree and place ment of arthritis between the two age groups. For the first time, this research identifies important differences between juveniles and adults in a model of experimental arthritis and provides a model for testing the efficacy of arthritis interventions in juvenile versus adult rodents eliminating the need to extrapolate data from the adult population to the juvenile population. Susan Tupper , a doctoral student, in association with Drs. Punam Pahwa, Jen Stinson and Alan Rosenberg presented her research titled: How does pain change during the day for youth with arthritis? The presentation won top honours in the Health Services Category. The project investigated how arthritis pain changed during the day. Using an electronic diary, 112 youth aged 8 to 18 years with juvenile idiopathic arthritis answered a brief survey about their arthritis pain 3 times per day for 7 days. The findings of this study show that pain intensity varies throughout the day for youth with arthritis and the pattern of fluctuation varies for males and females and for the different types of juvenile arthritis. This new knowledg e will help design better research studies and education programs for youth with arthritis. More research is ne eded to understand why pain patterns are different for these groups. It may be because of underlying disease processe s or time varying factors, such as physical activity. Hea lth care providers, such as pediatric rheumatologists and physical therapists will be able to use the findings of this study when providing education to patients and their families about the typical pain experience.

The Department of Pediatrics, University of Saskatchewan, was established more than 50 years ago and is currently undergoing expansion. New faculty members with varied interests and expertise are collaborating with scientists from many different disciplines to initiate children's health research programs. This research is crucial to increase knowledge and understanding of childhood diseases, develop new forms of therapy, and promote more effective prevention strategies. The Children's Health Research Trust Fund (CHRTF) was established by members of the Department of Pediatrics in 1983 to help support child health research. Many generous donors have contributed to the Fund. As all funds donated to The CHRTF are endowed funds, CHRTF has continued to grow to become an important partner in helping to advance research in the Department of Pediatrics. For further information about the CHRTF and view the CHRTF Ci ty Optimist Club has made a generous contribution to the Children's Health Research Trust Fund to create the Optimist Club Research Fund. This contribution is consistent with the Optimist Club's mission to improve the lives of children. The Hub City Optimist Club is dedicated to \"Bringing Out the Best in Kids\" through community service programs. The Children's Health Research Trust Fund (CHRTF) is delighted to have the Hub City Optimist Club as a partner in pursuing better and healthier lives for children. Further information about the Saskatoon Hub City Optimist Club can cover photograph and the photograph on this page are images of a 4-week old piglet stifle joint showing anatomical structures in distinctive detail (cover) including vascular channels that are present in growing cartilage. The image on this page shows a lateral view of a piglet stifle (knee) joint using non-CT DEI. In contrast to conventional radiography growth cartilage can be seen clearly. Glendon Rhoades , a Masters student, is involved in conducting this research under the supervision of Drs. Dean Chapman and Alan Rosenberg. Also involved in this project are Drs. George Belev, Sheldon Wiebe, and Adelaine Wong.
