Over time, depression can interfere with people's lives and even affect their physical health. For people with milder cases, all-natural remedies for depression could be helpful. Natural Remedies for Depression to Try The idea of going into a [mood treatment center](https://www.banyanmentalhealth.com/mood-and-anxiety-disorders/) and taking anti-depressants can be scary. Not everyone is ready for this step, so you may be looking for some natural remedies for depression first that can help you better manage your symptoms. Exercise All you may want to do is sleep, but you should be getting up and moving. Regular exercise is a good natural remedy for depression because it has been proven to boost mood and increase energy levels. One study even found that regular exercise was as effective as antidepressants.1 Diet Diet is an important part of being healthy and there is some research to suggest that some vitamin and food can help reduce depression. Try eating more vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, B vitamins, and foods rich with antioxidants.2 Other people swear by supplements that include larger concentrations of these suggested ingredients, but research behind the efficacy of these supplements is lacking. Sleep Almost 75% of people with depression also have insomnia symptoms.3 This lack of quality sleep can make depression worse as well as lead to physical health problems. Focus on improving your sleep by setting a strict sleep schedule, creating a pre-bedtime routine, and resetting your circadian rhythm. Although you may feel tired, napping during the day can disrupt your sleep schedule and make your sleep problems worse. Meditation & Yoga Practices like meditation, mindfulness, and yoga are proven to help reduce stress and anxiety that can be leading causes of depression.4 Whenever you start to feel overwhelmed with stress or anxiety, take a few moments to meditate and collect yourself. Make yoga and mindfulness a part of your regular routine as well. Change Your Thinking People who are depressed may be caught in a vicious cycle of negative thoughts the perpetuates their depression.
