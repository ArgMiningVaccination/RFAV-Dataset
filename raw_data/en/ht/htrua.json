The kidneys are the master c hemists of the body. Normally you have two kidneys: one on either side of your spine under your lower ribs. They are pink and shaped like kidney beans. Each kidney is about the size of a closed fist. Why are the kidneys important? Kidneys remove wastes from the blood an d excrete them into the urine. Your kidneys also regulate certain electrolytes such as sodium and chloride, which are responsible for fluid balance; potassium, which is vital to your heart activity; and calcium and phosphorous, which are necessary for healthy bones and muscles. Your kidneys also pro duce hormones that assist with the production of red blood cells and the regulation of blood pressure. Many other organs depend on the kidn eys in order to work properly . What is renal disease and why do I need treatment? Another name for kidney disease is renal disease. You c an be healthy with one kidney. Renal disease usually affects both kidneys at the same time. When both kidneys do not work, waste material s and water stay in your body. Your body's chemical balance becomes upset. You become ill and need treatment to do the work your kidneys can no longer do. End -stage renal disease, or ESRD, means that you must have some form of dialysis treatment or a kidney transplant in order to stay alive. Kidney transplantation is currently the best way to re store renal function and is recommended for most individuals. What is a kidney transplant? A kidney transplant is a surgical procedure in which a healthy kidney from either a living or deceased donor is placed in your lower abdomen. It is not a cure, but a treatm ent for chronic kidney failure. It is the treatment of choice for those who are considered suitable candidates for a transplant. How does transplantation compare to dialysis treatment? Trans plantation has many advantages. It can treat your kidney failure, improve your health, and provide a lifestyle free from dialysis. Usually, you will have fewer fluid and diet restriction s after getting a \"new kidney.\" Most people even feel well enough to return to work or school . With transplantation comes responsibili ties. For your new kidney to work, you must take medications every day, exactly as taught, for as long as the kidney is working, an d perhaps for your whole life. These medic ations can have side effects. Complications may arise, such as rejection of your ne w kidney or an infection. Each patient responds differently and each patient is unique. 3 Candidate Evaluation Generally, to be el igible, you must be less than 80 years old. Any other medical problems you have must be well controlled. You will need to meet with the transplant team, including the transplant surgeon, transplant nephrologist, nurse coordi nator, dietician, pharmacist, social worker, and financial coord inator. The surgeon will exa mine you to determine if you have any medical or surgical reasons why kidney transplant would not be appropriate . He will discuss the surgery itself, determine what additional tests need to be done and address any questions or concerns you and your family may have. The coordinator will set up the appointments and explain any additional te sts the doctor may have ordered and also explain what takes place in the hospital when the transplant actually occurs. The social worker will address any emotional or financial concerns you may have. The Transplant Nephrologist works closely with the surgeon in completing the medical evaluation. All candidates must undergo extensive testing before transplantation. The blood tests include blood grouping, kidney function, liver function, and viral studies such as hepa titis and HIV . Tissue typing is the determination of specific proteins that are on the cell surface. These proteins are called antigens . All people receive three antigens from their f ather and three fro m their mother . This test will allow us to better match a kidney to you. Other routine tests are urine tests, chest x -ray, TB test, EKG and echocardiogram. You will also need to see a Cardiologist and P sychiatrist. You must identify a Care partner/Support Person who will help you through the surgery and initial recovery. This Support Person will need to come to all of your evaluation appointments to learn what this role involves and ask questions as they come up . You must have stable, s ecure housing, transportation to the Transplant Center for follow up care, and insurance to cover the surgery and costs of your medications. Once all the test results are revie wed by our Transplant Committee and the team has cleared you for a transplant, y ou will be placed on the active waiting list. To remain active you must send a blood sample to the organ bank each month. This is usually coordinated through your dialysis center or nephrologist. Transplant Team Members A Transplant Surgeon will conduct an evaluation, from a surgical standpoint, to ensure that you remain an acceptable candidate while you are on the list at BMC. The surgeon is available to discuss your case with your nephrologists should the need arise. A Transplant Nephrolo gist will conduct an evaluation, to ensure that you remain medically suitable to receive a transplant at BMC. The Transplant Nephrologist is available to discuss your case with your nephrologists should the need arise. The Transplant Coordinator provides r einforced education regarding the transplant process, listing for transplant and patient responsibilities before and after transplant. The coordinator is your advocate throughout the transplant process and will work with you to ensure all your needs are me t. This coordinator is your contact person here at BMC and a resource for you. The coordinator is responsible for ensuring you fully understand the transplant process and your responsibilities in partnering with BMC for your continued care. A Psychiatrist and Social Worker are available to you throughout the waiting period and will meet with you to evaluate your ability to cope with the stress of transplantation and your ability to 4 follow a rigorous treatment plan, both before and after transplantation and address any additional concerns that may arise while you await your transplant. A Dietitian will evaluate you while you are on the wait list to ensure your nutritional status remains optimal for transplant. The dietitian is also available to you at any time while you wait for transplant. A Pharmacist will also evaluate your current med list and identify any possible drug -drug interactions that may occur after transplant and they will make recommendations to either avoid the interactions or decrea se the p otential side effects. The pharmacist will also teach you about your medications , why you need to take them, and assess compliance with your medication regimen. A Transplant Financial Coordinator will meet with you to discuss your insurance coverage and advise if there are additional coverages you may be eligible for. You may be required to see other specialists during your evaluation and follow up visits depending on your health conditions and age, like a cardiologist. Types of Kidney Transplants Living Donor: A living donor kidney come s from a healthy adult . When a person volunteers to be a potential living donor, blood tests are performed to determine com patibility with the recipient. The pre -transplant tests performed are blood grouping, tissue typing and cross matching . Blood group testing between the donor and recipient must be compatible before tissue typing an d cross matching are performed. Once compatibility is confirmed the donor must undergo additional testing. This testing includes eval uation s by a Nephrologist, a S urgeon, a Social Worker, a Nutritionist, a P harmacist, blood tests for kidney and liver function, viral studies, urine studies, chest x -ray, EKG, ultrasound, and computerized tomography (CT) scan of the kidneys. The CT shows t he kidney anatomy and is used to determine which kidney will be used for transplantation. Donors will meet with our Living Donor Advocate, who is not a member of the Transplant Team, but whose role is to ensure donors understand the risks and benefits of d onor surgery and advocate for the rights of each donor. If all the test results are acceptable, the surgery will be scheduled. At Boston Medical Center, laparoscopic donor kidney removal is routinely performed. This procedure is less painful for the donor and the recovery time is shorter. With this type of procedure donors sp end an average of two days in the hospital and the recovery time is approximately 4 weeks. Statistics show that kidney transplants from live donors function longer and the survival rate for live donor kidneys is greater than 95 % for the first year. The average life of a kidney donated from a perfectly matched (tissue typing identical) sibling is 25 to 30 years and the average life of a kidney donated from a half matched or unrelated donor is 16 years. No live donor candidate is allowed to donate a kidney unless the transplant team is certain, to the best of their ability, that the donor will live a normal, healthy life with one kidney. Deceased Donor: A deceased donor kidney comes from a person who has chosen to be an organ donor and has been declared de ceased. Like the living donor, the deceased donor must have blood testing performed to show compatibili ty with the proposed recipient. The kidney transplant survival rate for the first year with a deceased donor kidney is 85% to 90 %. The average functional time period of a deceased donor kidney transplant is between 8 and 20 years. 5 Insurance Information Most insurance companies including Medicare, Medic aid, private companies, and HMO s cover the costs of kidney transplantation. It is important for you to kn ow exactly what your insurance company covers before the transplant surgery. Some companies require a pre -authorization for transplant procedures. You need to be aware of this to ensure that your insurance has approved the procedure before the surgery. Medicare covers 80 % of the cost of the anti -rejection medications you will need after the transplant. Yo u or your secondary insurance are responsible for the remaining 20 %. This Medicare coverage lasts for 36 months , after the date of your transplant unless y ou remain eligible for Medicare based on disability or age. If you remain eligible, the medication coverage contin ues for as long as you have Medicare. If you are ineligible for Medicare, after 36 months, you will need another type of insurance to pay for your anti - rejection medications . If you have private insurance you need to be aware of their specific requirements for medication coverage. It is essential that you discuss any concerns about insura nce or payment with the transplant team. Our Transplant Financial Coordinator will work with you to determine the best options for you for covera ge for your transplant and post -transplant medications. They can provide you with additional resources to help you determine t he best way to manage the expenses associ ated with kidney transplantation. Waiting Once all of the testing is complete your candidacy will be presented to the Transplant Multidisciplinary Committee for approval to be placed on the BMC Waitlist. Once the transplant candidate is 'Listed\" the cand idate must wait (unless a living donor has been identified) . It is the patient's responsibility to update any address, insurance or telephone number changes or any health conditions that change with the Transplant Team . If you move or are going away, let y our coordinator know ahead of time. It is important during this waiting time to keep a positive attitude and take steps to deal with stress. The candidate will be seen in the transplant clinic annually or until the kidney transplant has taken place. Most o f all, keep things i n perspective. Realize that after kidney transplant your life will likely improve . Your health and independence are just around the corner. 6 The Transplant Operation You should p lan to spend about five days in the hospital aft er your kidney transplant . Once you arrive at the hospital, many tests will be performed including another chest x -ray, EKG, urine studies and blood tests. You will not be able to eat or drink anything for eight hours before the surgery. Both the surgeon and the a nesthesiologist will meet with you before the surgery and explain the procedure and how you will be put to sleep. If you receive a living donor kidney, the transplant surgery will be scheduled in advance. If you receive a deceased donor kidney you will be called to the hospital when one becomes available. The kidney transplant surgery will take anywhere from 3 - 4 hours to complete . You will be given general anesthesia to put you to sleep during surgery. Once you are asleep, a catheter will be placed into your bladder in order to accurately measure your urine output. This catheter will stay in fo r 3-5 days after your surgery. After you are asleep, an incision a bout eight inches long is made on the right or left side of your lower abdomen. The new kidney is placed beneath the incision and the kidney blood vessels are attached to the artery and vein that supply your leg. The ureter of the donor kidney is sewn to your bladder. Unless your doctor feels it is necessary, your diseased native kidneys will not be removed. You will be taken to the SICU (Surgical Intensive Care Unit) once your surgery is completed. You may have a 'stent' placed during the surgery, where the transplanted ureter is attached to your bladder. This stent can may help prevent urine from leaki ng while the connection heals. This stent is usually removed a few weeks after the transplant in our urologists' outpatient clinic . 7 The Recovery All Transplant Recipients remain in the SICU (Surgical Intensive C are Unit) the first night after surgery for monitoring of vital signs, urine output and fluid status. When you awaken in the SICU, you will notice an IV in either your arm or neck. You will have a tube going into your bladder that drains your urine into a collection bag. This tube is called a Foley catheter and it will stay in for three days. You will have oxygen tubing in your nose to help you breathe easier. There will be a dressing over your incision on your abdomen. You will have a button to push to give yourself pain medication when you need it. The nur ses and doctors on this unit will be monitoring you very closely. They wi ll be checking your vital signs (temperature, blood pressure and pulse) and your urine output e very hour. To prevent pneumonia you will be instructed to take deep breaths and cough fr equently. The nurses will also show you how to use a machine called an incentive spirometer . Proper use helps keep your lungs expanded . Usually 24 - 36 hours after surgery you will be transferred to the Surgical Step Down unit . This is where you will stay until you are discharged from the hospital. The staff on the SICU and Surgical Step Down unit have special expertise in th e care of transplant patients. They are knowledgeable about the transplant medications and will help you thoroughly learn them. They w ill educate you on the signs and symptoms of infection and rejection and provide you with follow -up instructions. You will be encouraged to get out of bed as soon as your team feels this is safe, usually within 24 hours of transplant. Walking will help pre vent post -op complications like blood clots and pneumonia. Once you are able to pass gas, you will be allowed to drink and eat . The nurses will be closely monitoring the amount of fluid you drink and the amount o f urine you produce . Many factors influence when a new kidney begins to work. Do not be alarmed or disappointed if the new kidney does make urine immediately. Sometimes a new kidney needs a few days or week s to regain complete function. We call this delay in regainin g the kidney function \"Delayed G raft F unction\". Every morning while you are i n the hospital you will have blood drawn and you will be weighed. These things help the transplant team understand how well the new kidney is working. You will begin taking new medications for anti -rejection. Your Post -Transplant Coordinator will give you a red binder with checklists to kee p track of your medications once you are home . You and your caregiver will work with members of the Transplant Team and our Pharmacy Team while you are in the hospital to lear n your medication regimen, and the do's and don'ts of life after transplant. We are always available to answer any questions you may have. You will leave the hospital with the Red Transplant Binder which includes a list of your medications and doses on a MedActionPlan , a vital signs log to record your vital signs at home, and your Discharge Education information, which, includes all the contact information for the members of your Transplant Team. Your Binder, MedActionPlan , and vital signs log should be with you at all clinic visits to allow us to review your medications and make any necessary changes and to allow us to review your weight and blood pressure results and to look for subtle changes that may need attention. You can expect to stay in the hospital for 4-5 days after your surgery . 8 Precautions Your immune system will try to attack your new kidney as if it were a bacteria or a virus. Therefore, you will be given medication to suppress your imm une system (immunosuppression). The first doses of medications will be given in the operating room. As a result of this immunosuppression, you will be at risk for infection . You will need to wear a mask when you are outside of your room and walking around the hospital floor. This is to protect you. To further protect you from infections we ask that you adhere to the following practices both here in the hospital and once you are home. These practices have been creat ed by members of the Transplant Infectious Disease Te am to limit exposure to bacteria that may be harmful to transplant recipients. You will be instructed to wear a mask for the first six weeks post-transplant, whenever you are somewhere you may be exposed to sick people. For example, any doctor's office, getting your blood drawn, anytime you are in the hospital corridors or waiting rooms. Good hygiene should always be maintained in order to avoid infections. Frequent hand washing and hand sanitizers should be used frequently by you and your family. Anyon e entering your hospital room (including your care team members) should use hand sanitizer or wash hands thoroughly as they enter. Raw or undercooked fish, seafood, meat, and poultry are strongly discouraged. You should not have loose ice in your beverag es. Avoid crowds. In the first month or so after your transplant, while you are taking high doses of immunosuppressive medications, you are more likely to get an infection. Stay away from people who have measles, mumps, chickenpox, shingles, or the flu. Although these sound like strict reco mmendations, they are for your safety . Please speak with a member of the transplant team for further clarification. 10 Possible Complications The two major complications that can occur after transplant surgery are infection and rejection. Infection: Although very uncommon, a n infection can oc cur in your surgical incision. It is very important that this site remains clean and dry. There will be a sterile dressing covering the incision most of the time while you are in the hospital. If you notice any redness, tenderness, or drainage at the incis ion site, you should notify your doctor or nurse. Other infections include pneumonia, urinary tract infection, fungal and viral infect ion. Rejection: Rejection occurs when your body tries to get rid of the foreign object (transplanted kidney) . In this case , the foreign object is your new kidney. There are three types of rejection - hyperacute, acute and chronic . *Hyperacute rejection is very rare and occurs during the surgery or within the first few hours after the surgery. This rejection results in c omplet e failure of the kidney. It can be avoided by careful matching the blood of the donor and the recipient. *Acute rejection is the most common . You are at the greatest risk for developing this type of rejection in the first three months after surgery. It is importa nt that you recognize signs of rejection and contact your transplant team as soon as possible. If detected early, this type of rejection can be treated successfully. *Chronic rejection occurs gradually over a period of years and may be difficult to treat. The following are possible signs of rejection: Fever greater than 100 degrees Sudden weight gain of three or more pounds overnight Decreased urine output Pain or tenderness over the kidney transplant site The most important thing you can do to p revent rejection is to take your anti -rejection medications exactly as they are prescribed. You will need to take these medications for as long as you have your new kidney. Missing anti -rejection medications will put you at risk for rejection. 11 Medications After Transplant It is your responsibility to learn about your new medications and to take them exactly as they are prescribed. It is important for you to know the following about each medication: Name Purpose Dose When to take each dose Main side effects Each person's medications will be individually determined by the transplant team. Doses are often changed based on blood levels and side effects. PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE ANY OF YOUR MEDICATIONS UNLESS DISCUSSED WITH A MEMBER OF THE TRANSPLANT TEAM. Please do not take any medications prescribed by any doctor or over the counter medications without first checking with the transplant team. You and your family/support person must have a good und erstanding of the medications. Not only should you know the names of the medications prescribed, but also the doses you are taking, the time you take it, and any side effects you are having. Shortly after your surg ery, you will be provided with a personalized medication information sheet called a MedActionPlan. Your nurse will begin teaching you about the medications as she/he gives them to you and a pharmacist will teach you about your medications before discharge. You should study the medications in addition to the information included in this manual so that you have a good understanding of them and feel comfortable leaving at discharge. As described earlier, your body's natural response to a foreign object (i.e. , the transplanted organ) is to destroy it. To help block your immune system's natural response, we will prescribe medications that suppress your immune system, so that the immune system does not t ry to destroy your new kidney. As time passes, your immune s ystem's respo nse will become less powerful. We will slowly reduce the doses and/or number of your immune supp ressant medications. When your immune system is suppressed, you are at a higher risk of getting infections from bacteria or viruses. You will also take new medications to prevent infections, but they are usually only needed for the first 6 months after your transplant. You will notice as you read through this section that many of the medications have side effects. Some people do not experience any si de effects, some experience just a few, and some may experience many side effects. Everyone's response is different to these medications. The side effects of the immunosuppressive medications are generally related to the dose. Therefore, as the dose is dec reased, t he side effects also decrease. It is important for you to be familiar with the side effects and to be aware of measures that can help reduce them. Many other medications, including over the counter, non -prescription, and herbal medications have interactions which can dangerously change the amount or effect of your immunosuppressive medications. REMEMBER: DO NOT TO TAKE ANY MEDICATIONS, HERBAL SUPPLMENTS, VITAMINS, OR OVER THE COUNTER PRODUCTS OTHER THAN THOSE PRESCRIBED BY THE TRANSPLANT TEAM, UNLESS THE TEAM IS AWARE . Your doctor, pharmacist and transplant coordinator are good resources to answer any quest ions you may have. You will be taking some, not all, of the following medications after your transplant. REMEMBER: PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE ANY OF YOUR MEDICATIONS UNLESS DISCUSSED WITH A MEMBER OF THE TRANSPLANT TEAM. NEVER SKIP YOUR MEDICINES WITHOUT LETTI NG THE TRANSPLANT TEAM KNOW. 15 Immunosuppressive Medications Your body's defense system (your immune system) fights off bacteria and viruses that try to attack you and make you sick. Unfortunately your body and immune system will think that your new kidney is also an invader trying to attack you, and this is called \"rejection\". Your body will never compl etely adjust to the new organ. Therefore, you will be taking medications to block your immune system for the life of your kidney after your transplant so tha t they don't cause harm to the kidney or cause rejection. These medications are called \"immunosuppressants\" or anti -rejection medications. INDUCTION THERAPY: Your immune system's response against your new kidney will be the strongest immediately after yo ur surgery. Therefore, you may receive very powerful immunosuppressive medications while you are in the hospital. These strong medications are a part of what is called \"induction therapy\". Induction therapy ensures that your immune system is suppressed eno ugh so that it will not reject your new organ while we get you on the right amount of medication. Depending on how strong the transplant team expects your immune response to be, you will receive induction therapy with high dose steroids and either Thymoglo bulin or Simulect. MAINTENANCE MEDICATIONS: Anti-rejection medications work best when we use them together. In most cases we will prescribe two or three different anti -rejection medicines, and over time you will need less medicine. Your time will work with you to find the best combination of medications to protect your kidney and have few side effects. If you miss taking your anti -rejection medicines even ONCE or skip taking them, this can cause rejection and may cause your new kidney to stop working. Example: 16 The following is a list of some of the medications that you may be required to take after your trans plant. Your Transplant T eam will determine the best medication combination for you. Prograf\u00ae/Envarsus XR\u00ae/Astagraf XL\u00ae (tacrolimus) Tacrolimus is one of the main anti -rejection medications that you will take afte r your transplant. Tacrolimus is sometimes called \"tacro\" for short. It helps to stop your body from rejecting your new kidney. Your transplant team will use blood tests to monitor the leve l of your tacrolimus to make sure that it's not too high and not too low. You may have extra side effects if it's too high. If it's too low, you could reject your kidney. When you go for a blood test, do NOT take tacrolimus in the morning before the test. Take it after you have your blood drawn. There are 3 different forms of tacrolimus: Prograf\u00ae/generic tacrolimus - immediate release capsules - you take every 12 hours Envarsus XR\u00ae - extended release tablets - you take once a day in the morning Astagraf XL\u00ae - extended release capsule - you take once a day in the morning Do NOT switch between versions unless your team tells you to Do NOT switch between different generic versions unless you let your team know and you schedule to get lab work done PLEASE REMEM BER, NEVER STOP TAKING YOUR TACROLIMUS (PROGRAF) OR CHANGE THE DOSE WITHOUT SPEAKING WITH A MEMBER OF THE TRANSPLANT TEAM. How Much Your transplant team will tell you how much you need to take (usually 1mg capsules) How Often Every 12 hours for immediate release tacrolimus, every 24 hours for extended release tacrolimus How Long Lifelong Side Effects Low magnesium levels High potassium levels High blood pressure High blood sugar/developing diabetes Decreased kidney function Tremors/shakiness Headache Trouble sleeping Special Instructions You should always take tacrolimus at the same time Be consistent with how you take it (always before or always after you eat) Avoid grapefruit and any drinks that contain grapefruit juice (Fresca, Sunny Delight) and p omegranate 17 Myfortic\u00ae (Mycophenolic acid) Myfortic\u00ae (mycophenolic acid) is an anti -rejection medication to prevent your body from rejecting your new kidney. Myfortic\u00ae is supplie d as 180 mg or 360 mg tablets. If you are prescribed this medication, you will take it in the morning and in the evening along with your tacrolimus. FDA warning: this medication is linked to increased risk of loss of pregnancy and birth defects. Females of child bearing age must be counseled about preventing pregnancy and planning If you become pregnant while taking this medication, let your doctor know immediatel y Before taking the medication, talk to your team about birth control options PLEASE REMEMBER, NEVER STOP TAKING YOUR MYCOPHENOLIC ACID (MYFORTIC ) OR CHANGE THE DOSE WITHOUT SPEAKING WITH A MEMBER OF THE TRANSPLANT TEAM . How Much Your transplant team wil l tell you how much you need to take (usually 180mg tablets) How Often Every 12 hours How Long Lifelong Side Effects Stomach upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) Low white blood cell count Special Instructions If you take anything with calcium, magnesium, or aluminum hydroxide (Maalox, Mylanta, Tums, or Phosphate Binders) you should take them 1 hour before or 2 hours after taking your Myfortic\u00ae Prednisone Prednisone is a corticosteroid used to help both prevent and treat rejection by further s uppressing the immune response. Initially after your transplant, you will be given the intravenous (IV) form of prednisone, called Solu -Medrol or methylprednisolone. This IV treatment will continue for 5 day s when yo u're in the hospital. If your doctor thinks you need prednisone long -term, you will start oral prednisone at the end of the IV treatment. How Much Your transplant team will tell you how much you need to take (usually 5mg tablets) How Often Usually once a day How Long Your transplant team will tell you how long you need to take this medicine for Side Effects Trouble sleeping, mood swings, night sweats High blood sugars Water retention, high blood pressure Acne Increased appetite, heartburn Osteoporosis 18 Medications to Prevent Infection After you receive your new kidney, your immune system will be low because of the anti -rejection medicines. This will mean that your body won't be able to fight off infections as easily as it did before. Your transplant t eam will prescribe you medicines to protect you from some infections for the first few months after the transplant. Valcyte\u00ae (Valganciclovir) Valcyte \u00ae is an antiviral medication used to prevent or treat cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes, and chicken pox infections. How Much 1-2 tablets (450mg) How Often Usually once a day, may also be given 2 -3x per week. Based on kidney function How Long 3-6 months Side Effects Low white blood cell count Low red blood cell count Low platelets Mepron\u00ae (Atovaquone) Mepron\u00ae prevents pneumonia caused by the fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCP). Mepron\u00ae is a bright yellow liquid with a citrus/tutti frutti flavor. How Much 10mL (1500mg) How Often Usually once a day How Long 12 months, some people may have to take for the rest of their life Side Effects Stomach upset Mycelex\u00ae (Clotrimazole Troche/lozenge) This medication is used to help prevent a fungal infection in your mouth and throat called \"t hrush\" which is from Candida . You should let one lozenge melt in your mouth three times a day after meals. You should not eat or drink anything for 15 min after taking the medication to allow the medication to absorb into yo ur mouth and throat where it needs to work. In most cases we will instruct you to discontinue this medication 3 months after your transplant. How Much 1 tablet (10mg) lozenge How Often Three times a day How Long 3 months Side Effects Stomach upset Special Instructions Let the medicine dissolve so that it can coat your mouth You should not eat or drink for 30 minutes after doing this 19 Anti-Ulcer/Heartburn Medications Some medications (like steroids) are hard on your stomach. You may need to take some medication to treat heart burn, indigestion, or prevent stomach ulcers. Some of these are available over the counter. Some of the medications may interact with your transplant. Please discuss with your transplant team before you start taking these medicat ions Listed below are medications that we may prescribe to help minimize this problem. Pepcid\u00ae (Famotidine) - Pepcid\u00ae comes in 20 mg tablets which can be taken once or twice a day. Protonix\u00ae (Pantoprazole ) - Protonix\u00ae comes in 40 mg tablets and is taken o nce or twice a day. Prilosec\u00ae (Omeprazole) - Prilosec\u00ae comes in 20 & 40 mg capsules that can be taken once or twice a day. Electrolyte Treatments Some of the medications you are taking may change the normal levels of electrolytes in your body. You may be given supplements to increase or decrease levels of these electrolytes, depending on what you need. Listed below are some medications that we may prescribe to help. Magnesium Oxide - Magnesium oxide may be given to increase your magnesium levels. K-Phos N eutral (Phospha 250) - K-Phos Neutral is a phosphorus supplement that may be given to increase your phosphorus levels Kayexalate (Sodium polystyrene sulfonate) - Kayexalate is a drug given to lower your potassium levels Pain Medications Sometimes patients need to take medications after transpl ant for pain from the surgery. If you need to take pain medications at home, you must discuss this with the transplant team. Oxycodone and Tylenol\u00ae (acetaminophen) are pain medications that y ou can take if needed for pain. Some pain medications like non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be harmful to your new kidney. You should not take Advil\u00ae, Motrin\u00ae, Aleve\u00ae, or any medications that contain ibuprofen or naproxen unless the transplan t team tells you to ta ke them. Aspirin is also an NSAID and should only be taken to protect your heart if the transplant team tells you to take it. Medications to Treat Constipation After transplant you may have difficulty moving your bowels. This can be a side effect of pain medications, surgery, and laying dow n while recovering. If it hurts to move your bowels or if you have not moved them after transplant, you sh ould tell the transplant team. The team may tell you to take medications to help you move your bowels. Docusate (C olace\u00ae), Senna (Sennakot\u00ae), and Polyethylene glycol (Miralax\u00ae) are laxative medications that will help you move your bowels. If you're having diarrhea, stop taking these medications. 20 General Pharmacy Information The number, type, and cost of the medicati ons that you take after t ransplant can be overwhelming. Many local pharmacies do not carry immunosuppressive medications and mu st special order them for you. In addition, depending on your insurance carrier and their prescription plan, you may be required to use a specific pharmacy or a mail order pharmacy. Our Transplant Pharmacist will work with you, after the transplant, to arrange monthly fills of your medicine at a BMC pharmacy. This allows to us help you with refills, insurance issues, and making sure you have all of the medicines you need at all times. IF YOU EVER ENCOUNTER PROBLEMS TAKING OR OBTAINING YOUR MEDICATIONS, PLEASE TELL US IMMEDIATELY. WE CAN HELP! 1. NEVER stop taking your medicines without talking to your transplant team 2.

Call your transplant team if you miss a dose, another doctors prescribes you a medicine, you want to take something over the counter, if you lose insurance, your copays are too high, or you don't have insur ance. 12. Continue to take the same version of your medicine. If your pharmacy changes your medicine to a different manufacturer (different size, shape, color), you may need to have your labs checked to see if you need a change in your dose 21 General Home Car e Blood Pressure, Temperature and Weight : After you are discharged home , you will be required to keep a daily log of your blood pressure, temperature, and weight. This will enable the transplant team to follow trends, adjust your medications as needed, an d notice subtle changes that may reflect an ongoing process that needs attention. You should take and record your vital signs at the same time every day, approximately one hour after you have taken all your morning medications. Please record these data in your vital signs log. Blood Pressure A blood pressure cuff will be given to you at discharge. By the time you are discharged, you or caregiver should know how to take your blood pressu re and what the numbers mean. Blood pressure varies with gender, age, fa tigue, anxi ety level and state of health. Check with your transplant team to determine what should be your blood pressure range. We will be asking you to take your blood pressu re daily and record it in your log book. By monitoring your blood pressure at home, you can have a better idea of whether your blood pressure is under control. High blood pressure has many causes but usually reflects changes in your kidney function or sid e effects of your medications. It can even be increased by too much sodiu m (sal t) in your diet. Be sure to report elevated blood pressure to your transplant team so they can determine the cause and begin the necessary treatment. Also be sure to report low blood pressures if you feel dizzy or lightheaded. Temperature A digital the rmometer will be given to you. After discharge you will be required to check your temp erature daily. You should write the result in your vital signs log and notify the transplant team if you have a temperature greater than 101 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degree s Celsius. Weight We ask you to weigh yourself every morning. It is best to use the same scale and to do it at the same time of day. Record the weight in the vital signs log and alert the transplant team if your weight changes (up or down) by 5 or more pou nds in one day. Glucose Monitoring Some recipients develop diabetes as a side e ffect of medications. These patients may require oral agents or insulin to control their blood sugar. If this occurs, yo u will also need a glucometer. A glucometer is a device used to check the sugar levels in your blood. You will be further instruct ed if this becomes necessary. Nutrition Eating right is an important part of your recovery after transplant surgery. Good nutrition will help your body heal, fight infection and maintain a healthy weight. Certain medications you take may cause an increase in your blood pre ssure, blood sugar, cholesterol and weight. The following are some suggestions to help limit these side effects. 22 Reduce Sodium (S alt) I ntake : Limiting the a mount of salt you consume will help control your blood pressure and fluid retention. Do this by choosing not to add extra table salt to your meal. Good alternatives to salt are herb mixtures, onion and garlic powder, and other salt -free seasonings. Avoid processed foods. These foods have a lot of hidden sodium/salts. Protein: It is important to eat plenty of protein. This helps your body heal. Good sources of protein are lean meats and fish, low fat dairy products, and peanut butter . Fat and Cholesterol : Too much fat and cholesterol can cause heart disease. You should follow a diet that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol. You should avoid eating butter, whole milk, skin of poultry and fatty cuts of meat. Instead, choose margarine, olive or canola oil and lean meats. Calcium : Transplant patients are at a greater risk than other people for developing osteoporosis and bone fractures . Because of this, you should be sure to increase the amount of calcium and vitamin D in your diet. Good sources of calcium are low f at or skim milk, cheese, yogurt and calcium fortified orange juice. Sugars and Sweets : If you are diabetic you should already be limiting the amount of sugar you eat. Even if you are not a diabetic, the medications you take may cause your blood sugar to increase. All transplant patients should limit their intake of sugars and concentrated sweets. Potassium, Phosphorous and Magnesium : Your new medications may affect the levels of potassium, phosphorous, and magnesium in your blood. You may need to rest rict OR supplement your diet to keep these levels in a desirable range. The following are examples of foods high in each category. Potassium : cantaloupe, oranges, orange juice, broccoli, tomatoes Phosphorous : milk, cheese, yogurt, whole grains, raisins Magnesium : shrim p, peanuts, beets, spinach If you have any qu estions about these suggestions pleas e notify your transplant team. They can arrange for you to meet with a nutritionist, who will help you develop a diet regimen that is right for you. Exercise To stay healthy , both mentally and physically, it is important for you to exercise on a regular basis. A good way to begin is by walking on a daily basis. Do not lift anything that weighs more than 10 pounds for the first four weeks after surgery. Y ou sho uld start out slow and gra dually increase your activity. Remember to consult your doctor before starting on any kind of exercise plan. Your doctor will be able to advise you about an exercise plan t hat meets your individual needs. General Health Eye Health Ophthalmology examinations are recommended on a yearly ba sis following your transplant. Certainly if blurred vision and/or pain occur, you should have an ophthalmologist examine you before the annual appointment. Prednisone may cause cataracts. Blurred vision may be a result of elevated blood sugars and certain types of viral infections. If you currently wear glasses, you may notice a change in your prescription requirements. 23 Dental Health It is essential for you to maintain dental hygiene in order to prevent tooth decay and gum infections. You should have routine dental c are every six to twelve months. However, we ask that you avoid dental visits for the first 6 months after transplant, unless you are experiencing a dental emergency. When you do need dental work done, you will need to get an antibiotic to take 1 hour before the appointment from your doctor. Please contact the transplant team if you are having a dental procedure . OB/GYN OB/GYN examinations are advised for women on a yearly basis including cervical cancer screenings ( Pap smear) every 3 years for women age 21 -65 or cytology with HPV testing ever y 5 years for women age 30 - 65. You should also perform self-breast exams monthly (after your menstrual period if applicable). Women between the ages of 50 -74 should have a mammogram every other year. Vaccinations/Flu Shots Vaccinations should be discus sed with your transplant team. Vaccinations given within the first year after transplant may not be effec tive. Live virus vaccines should never be given to an immunosuppressed patient. The tetanus shot should be given every ten years. For any other vaccinations, please discuss with a member of the transplant team. The flu shot vaccine should be given annually. Live vaccines include: measles /mumps/rubella (MMR), rotavirus (oral and injection), smallpox, chicken pox, yellow fever, flu (nasal mist), oral polio, shingles (Zostavax\u00ae), oral typhoid Skin Care Careful skin care is a n ecessary part of your routine. The immunosuppressive medications put you at increased ris k for developing skin cancers. This risk is made worse by unprotected sun exposure. Following these suggestions may decrease the chances of this happening. Always use su nscreen when you are outdoors. Apply it liberally prior to going out in the sun and remember the sun is at its strongest between the hours of 11 AM and 3 PM. Examine your skin regularly and note any changes. We strongly recommend annual skin cancer sc reenings with a dermatologist. Please let the transplant team kn ow if you notice anything that appears suspicious to you. Smoking Smoking is Strongly Discouraged . Please speak with a member of the transplant team if you have any questions or need clarification on this subject. Follow -Up Visits You will be given an appo intment at discharge to return to clinic within one week afte r discharge from the hospital. We request that you do not take public transportation for the first 4 -6 weeks due to the risk of exposure to illness. Blood W ork: You will have blood work done at each clinic visit and should be drawn before your visits with the doctors here at BMC. The blood will be drawn in the lab drawing station at the Shapiro Center, Lower Level, 725 Albany Street. Please arrive a bit early for your appointment to allow time for this. Your lab order will be at the clinic desk on the 7th floor when you check in. Don't forget that blood must be drawn before taking your morning Prograf (Tacrolimus) or Rapamune (Sirolimus) dose. See the Medications section for more information. 24 Clinic Visits: After your blood is drawn you will be seen by either your Surgical Team (Surgeon, Transplant Pharmacist, and Transplant Coordinator), or your Transplant Nephrology Team (Nephrologist and Nephrology Fellow, Nurse or Coordinator) on Shapiro 7 . It is very important that you bring the Black Binder with you to each clinic visit. It will be helpful to keep a list of any questions or concerns that arise over the week t o ask when you are in clinic. You should not leave th e clinic until you are given a follow up appointment. REMEMBER: DO NOT TAKE YOUR Tacrolimus , Cyclosporine or Sirolimus BEFORE ANY BLOOD DRAWS! You should take these meds as soon as your blood test is drawn. You can expect to return to the clinic weekly for about 4 weeks and then less frequently as time goes on. It is important for you to reinitiate contact with your primary nephrologist after you are discharge d from the h ospital. Eventually you will be referred back to yo ur primary nephrologist for long-term, routine follow -up care , along with the transplant team . General Guidelines Once you have had a successful transplant, you are no longer a sick patient but a healthy person living a normal life . This applies to your relationship with family and friends just as it does to your professiona l and recreational activities. You can resume your previous activities and you may even feel goo d enough to add some new ones. You may need extra rest the first day or two after leaving the hospital, but a daily exercise program will imp rove and maintain your health. You will not damage, hurt, bump, or strain your kidney as long as you follow your tran splant team's recommendations. Here are some general guidelines: Avoid lifting, pushing, or pulling heavy objects and performing strenuous physical work for at least six weeks. When discharged, you should not lift anything heavier than a gallon of milk (approx. 8 lbs.) and over the course of the first six weeks, gradually work up to 15 lbs. These guidelines are meant to help you avoid developing a hernia in your incision. Avoid dark, dusty, damp areas where mold or fungus may grow (attics, wet basements, ...) Avoid contact sports. If you plan to go a way on vacation or for business let the trans plant team know ahead of time. Take all your medications wit h you. When traveling by plane carry your medications with you and d o not c heck them with your luggage. Also, keep your physician's name and number with you . You should also find out the location of the Transplant Center nearest to your travel destination before you leave home. https://optn.t ransplant.hrsa.gov/members/member -directory/ 25 Additional Resources American Kidney Fund Website: www.akfinc.org Phone: 800 -638-8299 American Association of Kidney National Website: www. www.unos.org Phone: (703) 414 -1600 America Website: Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Website: https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/ Reading : The following seven brochures are available from our Transplant Coordinators: \"United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) Pati ents Transplantation\" \"What Eve ry Patient Needs To Know\" - United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) \" \"Questions and Answers for Transplant Candidates about Multiple Listing and Waiting Time Transfer \" \"Questions and Answers for Transplant Candidates about Kidney Allocation Policy \" \"Living Donation | Information you need to know \" \"Transplant Living Brochure \" \"Kidney Transplant Evaluation and Listing \" At your local library or book store: 26 \"So You're Thinking About Kidney Transplantation: A Patient and Family's "}
