Yet while the COVID-19 pandemic has made us acutely aware of the importance of staying healthy on the road, travel vaccines have always been a mainstay of safe travel\u2014a crucial tool in avoiding the (often expensive) [headaches of getting sick](https://www.cntraveler.com/story/tools-to-stay-healthy-on-the-road), and treating sicknesses, abroad. Whether you have travel on the horizon or want to be prepared for 2023 trips and beyond, this guide will get you up to speed on the vaccinations required for travel depending on your destination, itinerary, and health status. Follow the below steps to protect your immune system in another country. Make sure you're current with [routine vaccines](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/routine-vaccines) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends all travelers be up to date on routine vaccines before travel. Routine vaccines include shots like COVID-19; chickenpox; Polio; and more. The has a full list of routine vaccines [here](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/routine-vaccines). \"'Routinely recommended vaccines' are vaccines that have been considered very important to prevent common diseases in the population to start,\" says [Lin H. Chen](https://www.mountauburnhospital.org/find-a-provider/profile/lin-chen/), M.D. director of the Travel Medicine Center at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the former president of the International Society of Travel Medicine (ISTM). Routine vaccines protect against disease that exists at low levels (chickenpox) or barely exists at all (measles) in the U.S. They also protect against severe disease from diseases that are still present in the United States (influenza or COVID-19). Generally, they're given in childhood or adolescence\u2014though some are given through adulthood\u2014so it's always a good idea to double-check your vaccination records. When traveling, routine shots are especially important because international travel increases your chances of both contracting and spreading diseases that aren't common in the U.S. A good example of this is measles. While it's practically non-existent in the U.S., international travel increases your risk of exposure and popular destinations [including Europe](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/routine-vaccines) still have measles outbreaks. It's worth double checking your status even if you think you're up to date: \"During the pandemic, some routine vaccination programs may have suffered lapses, so there is concern that diseases may become more common,\" says Dr. Chen. The routine vaccination recommendations have also changed over the years (the addition of the COVID-19 vaccine to the list is an example) and it's easy to let vaccines like tetanus ( [generally needed every 10 years](https://www.google.com/search?q=teatnus+vaccine+adults&oq=teatnus+vaccine+adults&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i13l2j0i22i30l3j0i5i13i30j0i8i13i30l2j0i8i13i30i457.3642j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)) lapse. \"It is even recommended at this time that certain adults who are traveling who have not had a polio vaccine for many years and are traveling to a risk area get an additional dose of the polio vaccine,\" says [Elizabeth D. Barnett](https://www.bmc.org/about-us/directory/doctor/elizabeth-d-barnett-md), M.D., a professor at Boston University Medical School and a leader in the field of travel and tropical Medicine. If you're [traveling with a child](https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/family-vacation-ideas-all-ages), talk to your pediatrician: Rules around vaccination can be different for babies traveling internationally. A baby who is not leaving the U.S., for example, gets their first dose of the MMR vaccine at 12 months; if they will be leaving the country, they get the first dose at [six months](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/travel-infographic.html#:~:text=Traveling%20abroad%20with%20your%20child,sure%20your%20children%20are%20protected.). Utilize official resources to learn more about vaccination recommendations around the world \"Understanding the epidemiology of where diseases are circulating is really important,\" says Dr. Chen. That's why, generally, she sends travelers to the [CDC's website](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list/), which outlines exactly what additional vaccines you may need for essentially every country in the world. All you have to do is plug in your destination and you'll find information about vaccines and medications, health travel notices, COVID-19 travel information, and more. Start a conversation with your primary care doctor\u2014then consider seeing a travel medicine specialist It's always good to start a conversation with your primary care doctor about vaccines before you travel, but if your itinerary is complex, involving multiple countries, being in rural areas, areas without good hygiene, or areas where you may not be able to protect yourself from mosquito- or food-borne illnesses, or if you have questions based on what you found on the CDC website or your own personal health history, consider asking your physician for a referral to a travel medicine specialist or travel clinic. After all, when it comes to vaccinations required for travel, it's not just about where you travel, but how you travel. \"The art of travel medicine is listening to where the person is going, what they're going to be doing, and making a decision based on the risk-benefit ratio,\" says Dr. Barnett. A travel medicine doctor will be able to analyze disease trends and trip details such as how long you'll be traveling or how well you'll be able to protect yourself against mosquitoes. \"You have to really dig into those things,\" she says. Take a vaccine called the Japanese encephalitis vaccine, which prevents a type of encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). \"We can't just say the risk is present in a specific country, because the risk depends on the time of year, whether the disease is being transmitted at that time, the exact location\u2014rural areas, especially farming regions are associated with much higher risk \u2014 whether there's a local outbreak situation going on, and more.\" You may not be able to get every shot you need at your primary care doctor's office either. The yellow fever vaccine, for example (which you may need if you're traveling somewhere like Sub-Saharan Africa or specific parts of South America), is only available at special travel clinics or public health settings, says Dr. Barnett. You can find a list of [travel medicine clinics](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/find-clinic) on the CDC's website. Your health background (what diseases you've had in the past, whether or not you're immune-suppressed, and if you're more predisposed to a certain condition) also play a role in what vaccines to consider. (A very small subset of people vaccinated against yellow fever, for example, experience severe adverse events, says Dr. Barnett.) The bottom line For many people and many trips, discussing travel plans with your primary care doctor and using the CDC's destination feature for vaccine guidance will suffice. Other, [more complex trips](https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/trips-to-book-a-year-in-advance) require a visit to a travel clinic. If you're aiming to get into one, start the process at least a month before your departure date\u2014appointments can be hard to get and your body needs time to build up immunity from any additional vaccines you may require.
