Such 0.5 services shall maintain a high standard of quality and shall be provided within the limitations and exclusions hereinafter specified. All providers participating in the Medicaid program must furnish services in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Medicaid program. Conditions of participation are available from Provider Services. This Chapter describes covered services, service limitations, and general reimbursement methodology. This manual obsoletes all previous pol icy and procedure manuals, bulletins and policy news. All Medicaid policies and requirements (such as prior authorizations, etc.) are the same for Nevada Check Up (NCU) , with the exception of the four areas where Medicaid and NCU policies differ as docum ented in the NCU Manual Chapter 1000. MTL 12/15 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 1201 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: AUTHORITY July 1, 2015 PRESCRIBED DRUGS Section 1201 Page 1 1201 AUTHORITY A. The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 42, Public Health, Chapter IV Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Subchapter C Medical Assistance Programs, Parts 430 through 456, states prescription drug co verage is an optional service under Title XIX. B. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1989 mandates additional preventive health care services for infants, children and young adults (newborn through age 20) eligible for Medicaid. These mandates provide that children and adolescents under age 21 receive follow -up services for a medically necessary condition discovered in a screening examination Early Preventative Screening and Diagnostic Testing (EPS DT) see Medicaid Services Manual (MSM) Chapter 1500; this includes prescription services. C. CFR Title 42 and Section 1927 of the Social Security Act, require states to provide for a Drug Utilization Review (DUR) program for covered outpatient drugs in order to assure that prescriptions are appropriate, medically necessary, and not likely to result in adverse medical results ( Social Security Administration ( SSA), Title 19, (g)(1)(A)). D. Section 1927 of the Social Security Act allows a state to require a prior authorization on any covered outpatient drug, providing the prior authorization program complie s with the requirements outlined in the act. The Social Security Act requires the establishment of a DUR board to monitor therapeutic appropriateness, use of generic products, overutilization and underutilization of drugs and quality of care consistent wi th protecting the health of program beneficiaries. E. Chapter 422 of Nevada Revised Statute ( NRS ) amended by AB 384 to require the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to: 1. develop a list of preferred prescription drugs ; 2. manage prescription drug use through the use of prior authorization and step therapy ; and 3. create the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. F. U.S. Troop Readiness, Veteran's Health Care, Katrina Recovery and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act 2007, Section 7002(b) of the act requires Medicaid outpatient drugs (defined in Section 1927(k)(2) of the Social Security Act) will be reimbursable only if non-electronic written prescriptions are executed on a tamper -resistant prescription pad.

Refill intervals must be consistent with the dosage schedule indicated on the original prescription. If a prescription is for a 34- day supply , a consistent refill would be filled in 30 days; an inconsistent refill date would be filled in 20 days from the original fill. c. Lost Medications. Nevada Medicaid does not pay for replacement of lost, stolen or otherwise destroyed medications even if a physician writes a new prescription for the medication. It is the responsibility of the recipient to replace these medications. Prior authorization may be granted in life -threatening situations and for maintenance medications only. See Qua ntity of Medication in this chapter for more information on maintenance medications. 5. Early Refills Nevada Medicaid only pays for up to a 34 day supply of medications (100 day supply for maintenance medications) for recipients each month. A prescription refill will be paid for by Nevada Medicaid only when 8 0% of the non -controlled substance prescription, and 90% of the controlled substance prescription, is used in accordance with the prescriber's orders on the prescription and on the label of the medication. In the instance that a recipient will be out of town when a refill is due, the pharmacist may enter the appropriate override code to allow an early refill. This override will be monitored by Nevada Medicaid for misuse/abuse by the recipient and/or provider. Medicaid will not pay for an early prescription refill when gross negligence or failure to follow prescriber's prescription instructions has been displayed by the recipient. 6. Quantity of medication The maximum quantity of medication per prescription payable by the Medicaid program is a 34 day supply. Exceptions are allowed for maintenance medications. a. In long -term care facilities, if the prescriber fails to indicate the duration of therapy for a maintenance drug, the pharmacy must estima te and provide at least a 30-day supply. Exceptions may be based on reasonable stop orders. (For oral liquid medications only, a 16 fluid ounce quantity will be considered sufficient to fulfill the 30 -day supply re quirement.) b. Prescription quantities may be reviewed; in those cases where less than a 30 -day supply of maintenance drug is dispensed without reasonable medical justification, the dispensing fee may be disallowed. MTL 12/15 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 1203 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY July 1, 2015 PRESCRIBED DRUGS Section 1203 Page 6 c.

Covered immunizations not included in the VFC Program will be reimbursable per the Nevada Medicaid and NCU Pharmacy Manual. MTL 12/15 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 1203 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY July 1, 2015 PRESCRIBED DRUGS Section 1203 Page 8 4. If the pharmacist administers the immunization, the dispensing fee will not be reimbursed. An administration f ee is paid instead. 1203.1B PROVIDER RESPONSIBILITY 1. For information on In-State and Out-Of-State Provider Participation refer to MSM Chapter 100. a. The pharmaceutical provider will maintain records for all prescriptions dispensed to eligible recipients as may be required. 1. The provider will allow, upon request of proper representative, access to all records that pertain to Medicaid recipients for fiscal review, audit or utilization review. 2. All fiscal records are to be maintained for a period of six years or as specified in federal regulation. 2. Utilization Control a. Prospective (Concurrent) Drug Utilization Review (Pro- DUR) Pro-DUR functions will be carried out via the Point of Sale (POS) Systems. 1. Pro-DUR edits apply to POS claims and paper Uniform Claim Form (UCF) claims. 2. Long Term Care ( LTC ) claims are subject to all Pro -DUR edits that apply to retail. 3. Providers may submit override codes using the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP ) standard interactive DUR codes. Override codes may be submitted on the initial claim. A denied claim does not have to be on file. 4. No long term prior authorizations are issued, codes must be entered each time errors occur. Reference the Nevada Medicaid an d NCU Pharmacy Manual (Pharmacy Manual) for more information on the current Pro- DUR edits and override procedures. 5. All drugs may be subject to quantity limitations. Refer to the Nevada Medicaid and NCU Pharmacy Manual for established quantity limits. MTL 12/15 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 1203 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY July 1, 2015 PRESCRIBED DRUGS Section 1203 Page 9 b. Retro Drug Utilization Review (DUR) Both recipient and provider profiles (i.e. claim payments) are reviewed to identify patterns of excess. Verification of receipt of services is ongoing on a sample basis. Providers may be audited on site. c. Drug Utilization Review (DUR) Nevada Medicaid policy and federal law allows the state appointed DUR Board to conduct review of the information compiled about individual clients and providers and allows the DUR Board to educate Medicaid providers about the chan ges in drug therapeutics. Educational programs may include information such as drug interactions between medications that physicians have prescribed for the clients and medications they are prescribing that are unnecessarily expensive. In this case, educat ional efforts will be directed to help providers improve their efficiency in the allocation of the finite resources available for Medicaid clients. d. Eligibility Please refer to MSM Chapter 100 for information on Medicaid eligibility, eligibility verification and the Eligibility Verification System (EVS). e. Lock -in Program: When a recipient has shown patterns of abuse/misuse of Nevada Medicaid benefits, or the DHCFP has determined that the recipient requires close medical management, the recipient may be \"locked -in\" to a specific pharmacy and/or provider. This means that Medicaid will only pay for controlled substance prescriptions/medical services at a single pharmacy/provider. 1. Criteria that is evaluated by the DHCFP when determinin g if a recipient should be locked in to a specific pharmacy begins with the number of controlled substance prescriptions filled in 60 days. If the recipient has filled ten or more controlled substance prescriptions in the past 60 day period (includes cont rolled substance pharmaceuticals given in the emergency room) then the clinical review continues with the following criteria: a. The recipient has utilized more than one pharmacy in the past 60 day period; b. The recipient has utilized more than three physicians in the past 60 day period; MTL 12/15 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 1203 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY July 1, 2015 PRESCRIBED DRUGS Section 1203 Page 10 c. The recipient has utilized the emergency room(s) for receiving controlled substances; d. The recipient has been diagnosed with a drug dependency related condition; e. The dispensed quantity per prescription of controlled s ubstances appears excessive by the clinical review team; or f. The recipient has other noted drug seeking behaviors(s). 2. The POS system will not allow another pharmacy to bill for controlled substance prescriptions, and a message will be given at the time of service to notify the pharmacy that the recipient is locked -in. Any non -controlled substance prescriptions can be filled at any pharmacy. 3. Recipients who are locked -in to one pharmacy can change their locked -in pharmacy at any time by contacting their Me dicaid District Office. 4. Pharmacies may call the Technical Call Center for an override to the locked -in pharmacy if: a. The locked -in pharmacy is out of stock. b. The locked -in pharmacy is closed. c. The recipient is out of town and cannot access the locked- in pharmacy. 3. Generic Substitution Per NRS Chapter 639, if the practitioner has not indicated that generic substitution is prohibited, the pharmacy provider must dispense, in substitution, another drug which is available to him if the other drug: a. is less expensive than the drug prescribed by brand name; b. is biologically equivalent to the drug prescribed by brand name; c. has the same active ingredient or ingredient of the same strength, quantity and form of dosage as the drug prescribed by brand name; and MTL 12/15 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 1203 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY July 1, 2015 PRESCRIBED DRUGS Section 1203 Page 11 d. is of the same generic type as the drug prescribed by brand name the least expensive of the drugs that are available to him for substitution. The pharmacy provider shall substitute the least expensive of the drugs available to him/her for substitution. 4. Prescriber Brand Certificati on Upper Limit cost limitations specified in this Chapter will not apply when a prescriber certifies that a specific brand of medication is medically necessary for a particular patient. The physician should document in the patient's medical record the need for the brand name product in place of the generic form. The procedure for certification must comply with the following: a. The certification must be in the physician's own handwriting. b. Certification must be written directly on the prescription blank. c. The phrase \"Dispense as written\" is required on the face of the prescription. For electronically transmitted prescriptions \"Dispense as written\" must be noted. Not acceptable: A printed box on the prescription blank checked by the prescriber to indicate \"brand necessary\" or a handwritten statement transferred to a rubber stamp and then stamped on the prescription. d. A prior authorization is required to override genetic substitution. e. Certification is not required if a generic is not manufactured. f. A fax copy/verb al order may be taken by the pharmacist from the physician but the pharmacy must obtain an original printed copy and keep on file. 1203.1C SERVICE DELIVERY MODEL For the rate and reimbursement methodology see MSM Chapter 700, Rates.

Pharmaceuticals that First Data Bank classifies as unit dose products are not covered for this policy. This incentive is available only to pharmacies supplying long -term care inpatients. The pharmacy provider must apply to the QIO -like Vendor Pharmacy Department to enroll in this incentive program. In accordance with the CMS, State Medicaid Director Letter (SMDL) 06 -005, repackaging of pharmaceuticals must be in compliance with the Nevada State Board of MTL 12/15 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 1203 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY July 1, 2015 PRESCRIBED DRUGS Section 1203 Page 14 Pharmacy. In addition, NFs must properly credit the Medicaid program for the return of unused pr escription medicines upon discontinuance of the prescription or transfer, discharge or death of a Medicaid beneficiary. This is to assure there is no double billing of the medication. 5. Coordination of Benefits (COB) On-line COB (cost avoidance) is part of the Nevada Medicaid POS system. a. If Nevada Medicaid is the recipient's secondary carrier, claims for COB will be accepted. b. Nevada Medicaid is always the payer of last resort. c. Other coverage will be identified by the presence of other carrier information on the recipient eligibility file. d. If the recipient shows other coverage, the claim will be denied. The POS system will return a unique client -identified carrier code identifying the other carrier, the recipient's policy number and the carrier name in the additional message filed. It is possible that a recipient may have more than one active other carrier; in that case, the returned code will be from the first carrier, subsequent codes will be returned until fully exhausted. Providers will be r equired to submit this code OTHER PAYER ID (#340 -7C) field as part of the override process. e. Even if \"no other insurance\" is indicated on the eligibility file, the claim will be processed as a TPL claim if the pharmacy submits. f. If other insurance is indic ated on the eligibility file, the claim will be processed as a TPL regardless of what TPL codes the pharmacy submits. g. In all cases, the Nevada Medicaid \"allowed amount\" will be used when calculating payment. In some cases, this may result in a \"0\" payment , when the insurance carrier pays more than the Medicaid \"allowable amount\". h. In order to facilitate the TPL/COB process, Nevada Medicaid will allow providers to override \"days supply limits\" and/or \"Drug Requires PA\" conditions by entering a value of \"5\" (exemption from prescription limits) in the PA/MC CODE field (NCPCP #416DG) if there are no prior authorization requirements on these drugs from the primary insurer. 6. Non-participating Health Maintenance Organization ( HMO) Providers MTL 12/15 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 1203 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY July 1, 2015 PRESCRIBED DRUGS Section 1203 Page 15 a. Recipients, who have Medicaid and HMO coverage, including Medicare HMOs, must seek treatment and services through their preferred provider network or HMO. Nevada Medicaid is not liable to pay for HMO covered services if the recipient elects to seek treatment from a provid er not authorized by the HMO. Unless the provider is an authorized provider of a recipient's health plan, the recipient should be referred to the plan for covered treatment, or the provider should contact the HMO for treatment authorization. Refer to MSM C hapter 3600, Managed Care Organizations (MCO), or MSM Chapter 100, Medicaid Program, for more information. b. Exceptions to Medicaid liability policy are: 1.

NCPDP Standard Billing Units Nevada Medicaid reimburses for outpatient pharmaceuticals according to NCPDP \"Billing Unit Standard Format\" guidelines. The standard provides for the billing of pharmaceuticals in one of three billing units for all drug products. These units are \"each\", \"milliliter (ml)\", and \"gram (g)\". The following guidelines are to be used when billing Nevada Medicaid for pharmaceuticals: Tablets, Capsules, Suppositories, Pre -filled Syringes: must be billed by \"each\" or by \"mls\" . For example, if 30 tablets of Me tformin are dispensed, the quantity will be 30. Liquids, Liquid Orals, Suspensions, Solutions, Opthalmic/Otic Solutions: must be billed by milliliters (mls). For example, if 560ml of guiafenesin is dispensed, the quantity entered will be 560.
