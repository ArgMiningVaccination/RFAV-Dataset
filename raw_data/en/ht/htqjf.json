The information within this report emphasizes the importance of continued Hawaii Child Death R eviews identifying strategies and recommendations to greatly reduce and limit preventable child deaths and improve child health and safety. Life events play an important role in ensuring healthy environments for children and families. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) puts out guidance for parents raising their children; di sease and conditions ; staying safe at home and out of the home; raising healthy children ; milestones and schedules ; engaging parents in school health; and back to school resources amid the COVID -19 pandemic for parents. The CDC has also confirmed through research that during the developmental period, children develop habits and behavior that can affect their lifelong health . Addressing and working with these childhood experiences is a preventive measure to reduce adult disparities. It is instrumental t o be able to provide parents and families with the \"appropriate resources \" to keep their children safe at home and in the community. CHILD DEATH REVIEW A. Family Health Services Division, Maternal and Child Health Branch The worldwide COVID- 19 pandemic of 2020- 2021 has greatly changed the lifestyles of many children, parents , and families , resulting in extraordinary modifications and adjustments to everyd ay living. Public and private agencies have redesign ed the wide array of services and resources in order to continue providing needed public health supports to children and families in Hawaii. The DOH Family Health Services Division (FHSD) is committed to continuously working towards improving the availability of and access to preventive and protective health services for individuals and families by providing leadership in collaboration with communities and public -private partners. These servic es are carried out by the administrative staff of the Division office and through three branches: Children with Special Health Needs (CSHN); Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) ; and Maternal and Child Health Branch (MCHB). A core aspect of MCHB is the ad ministration of services to reduce health disparities for women, children, and families of Hawaii. One key element of administering preventive public health services directed by MCHB is through three fatality reviews: child death, maternal mortality, and domestic violence. The Division's three branches work in Page 3 of 25 collaboration, sharing information to assist in identifying critical facts to prevent and reduce future similar deaths. B. Child Death Review Summary Child death reviews provide essential information needed to identify strategies to improve child health and safety. These child fatality reviews are theories and methods grounded in public health and designed to identify and understand risk factors for death. It is an examination of relevant records relating to the deceased by a multidisciplinary and multiagency team of professionals. The goal is to understand the causes, circumstances, and incidences of these deaths in Hawaii and identify objectives, r ecommendations, and outcomes to reduce the number of preventable child deaths. Information is then shared with the general public. 1) Child death reviews in Hawaii are reviewed one year after the death occurs and public and private members of the community examine the circumstances surrounding a child's death. 2) Interagency collaboration assists team members in understanding why children die and promotes the development of interventions to protect other children and prevent future deaths. 3) Data is then analyzed and recommendations are made in order to assess whic h deaths may be preventable. 4) Public and private agencies collaborate to ensure prevention strategies and recommendations are available for families, parents , and the entire community. 5) The National Center for Fatality Review and Prevention funded in part by Coopera tive Agreement from the U .S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Maternal and Child Health Bureau and provides support to Hawaii in the following areas: a) Ensures consistent reporting of the cause and manner of death within the National Fatality Review Case Reporting System that is available to the Hawaii Child Death Review team b) Encourages the improvement of communication and linkages among local and state agencies enhancing the coordination of efforts c) Provides webinars, training, data support , and resource development to Hawaii Page 4 of 25 C. Legislation for the Child Death Review The Child Deat h Hawaii Review System was legislatively established in 1997 by HRS \u00a7321- 341. MCHB was designated as the responsible state agency to implement these multidisciplinary and multiagency reviews of child deaths. In 2016, the Legislature passed Act 203, S.B. 2317 authorizing comprehensive multidisciplinary reviews of child deaths and adding the review of maternal deaths with the submission of an annual report to the Legislature. The stated purpose of these reviews is to understand risk factors and prevent future chil d and maternal deaths in Hawaii. HRS \u00a7321 -343 also provides access to information from all providers of healthcare, social services, and state and county agencies for the use of child death reviews upon written request from the Director of Health. HR S \u00a7321- 346 immunity from liability states that all agencies and individuals participating in the review of child deaths shall not be held civilly or criminally liable for providing the information required under this part. Funds for a registered nurse position was also approved through the 2016 Legislation Session and established in 2018. Recruitment was curtailed in March 2020 due to the COVID -19 pandemic and resumed in 2021. A Registered Nurse was recently hired through the DOH FHSD/MCHB to support the Child Death Review and Maternal Mortality Review administration practices. The child death categories selected for review in Hawaii have been defined by the National Center for Fatality Review and Prevention and supported by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Healt h Resources and Administration, Maternal and Child Health Bureau to include: child abuse and neglect, homicide, suicide, undetermined, natural, and unintentional injury. D.

The Hawaii team pro ject was encouraging adolescent wellness to reduc e the prevalence rate of youth suicide. 2) Continued consultation with the CDC for maternal mortality guidance and its impact on the health of women, infants, and the entire family 3) Continued consultation with the National Center for Fatality Review and Prevention for technical support and use of the Case Reporting System Page 17 of 25 MATERNAL MORTALITY REVIEW Requiring the Department of Health (DOH) to provide an annual report on the review of maternal deaths conducted by the department. As experts in providing maternal guidance to all 50 states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) describes positive pregnancy outcomes as healthy pregnancies that begin before conception and continue with regular prenatal care. In Hawaii, h ealthcare providers are instrumental in helping women prepare for pregnancy and for any potential problems that may arise during pregnancy. Early initiation of prenatal care by pregnant women and continuous monitoring of pregnancy by health providers ar e important in helping to prevent and treat severe pregnancy - related complications. A. Background and Purpose The Hawaii Maternal Mortality Review was established in 2016 and held its first review of maternal deaths in 2017. The purpose of the Hawaii Maternal Mortality Review is to determine the causes of maternal mortality and identify public health and clinical interventions to improve systems of care and prevent future maternal deaths. A Hawaii Maternal and Mortality Review policy and procedure manual was developed in 2016 and revised in 2021. The m anual identifies that the Hawaii Maternal Mortality Review Committee reviews all maternal deaths in Hawaii. The process for a maternal mortality re view in Hawaii is as follows: 1) A DOH Maternal and Child Health Branch (MCHB) research statistician works in collaboration with the DOH Vital Records Office to gather information on maternal deaths . 2) An abstractor then reviews the available medical and other specialty reports to create case summaries discuss ed during the committee reviews 3) The multiagency and multidisciplinary team reviews the case summaries . 4) A determination is made as to whether the death is pregnancy related or pregnancy associated . a) Pregnancy -related deaths are those that result from complications of pregnancy, the chain of events initiated by the pregnancy, or aggravation of an unrelated condition by the pregnancy. b) Pregnancy -associated deaths of a woman are from any cause while she is pregnant or within one year of termination of pregnancy. Page 18 of 25 5) Following the review of each maternal death, recomm endations are made by the Hawaii Maternal Mortality Review Committee to create plans of action that address preventive strategies for pregnant women to limit and reduce future deaths. According to the CDC, \" A maternal death is defined as the death of a woman while pregnant or within 1 year of the end of a pregnancy -regardless of the outcome, duration or site of the pre gnancy -from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes.\" The CDC collected data to support that over 700 women die from pregnancy -related complications each year in the United States, and in Hawaii, 80% of pregnancy -related deaths were found to be preventable. Amid the current coronavirus pandemic, the CDC advises that pregnant people are at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID -19 as compared to non- pregnant people. The CDC recommends the COVID -19 vaccination for everyone 12 years of age and older, including people who are trying to get pregnant now or might become pregnant in the future, as well as their partners. Professional medical organizations serving people of reproductive age, including adolescents, emphasize that there is no evidence that the COVID -19 vaccination causes a loss of fertility. These organizations also recommend COVID -19 vaccination for people who may consider getting pregnant in the future. The World Health Organization also recommends strong surveillance and testing of pregnant women to ensure well -being and that pregnant women should take the same precautions to avoid COVID -19 infection as others: frequent hand washing, avoid crowed places, maintain distance from others, and wear a mask. The increased focus on maternal mort ality during the pandemic has exacerbated the need for continuous collaboration between Hawaii public health agencies and medical healthcare organizations. B. Program Activities The activit ies below were completed in 2021 : 1) Continued to follow the national and local recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Hawaii State Department of Health (DOH) on the guidelines for COVID -19 prevention and other related health information amid the pandemic . Page 19 of 25 2) There were two Hawaii Maternal Mortality Review (HMMR) Committee review meetings in June and December to review 2019 and 2020 maternal deaths.
