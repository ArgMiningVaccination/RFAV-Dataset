Protocol number: CAPTIVA-NCT05047172 CAPTIVA is a two-stage Phase III trial intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis to: 1) ticagrelor low dose rivaroxaban + aspirin 3) clopidogrel + aspirin The primary goal of the trial is to determine if the experimental arm(s) (rivaroxaban or ticagrelor or both) are superior to the clopidogrel arm for lowering the 1-year rate of the primary endpoint (ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), or vascular death). The first stage of the trial is concluded by an interim safety analysis intended to identify an excess of parenchymal intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or non-ICH major hemorrhage with ticagrelor + aspirin or low dose rivaroxaban + aspirin that could lead to an early termination of one or both of those arms. The second stage of the trial will determine if the experimental arm(s) (rivaroxaban or ticagrelor or both) that progress to stage 2 are superior to the clopidogrel arm for lowering the 1-year rate of the primary endpoint (ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), or vascular death). An exploratory aim is to estimate the impact of CYP2C19 loss-of-function (LOF) carrier status on any benefit that the ticagrelor or low dose rivaroxaban arms may have in lowering the primary endpoint compared with the clopidogrel arm. - Protocol number: CARDIAMP-NCT02438306 Randomized Controlled Pivotal Trial of Autologous Bone Marrow Mononuclear Cells Using the CardiAMP Cell Therapy in Patients With Post Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure (CardiAMP Heart Failure Trial) - Protocol number: CARDIOL-100-004 Impact of CardiolRxTM on Recurrent Pericarditis - Protocol number: CARDIOL-100-102 Impact of CardiolRxTM on Myocardial Recovery in Acute Myocarditis - Protocol number: CARDUS-HANDHELD Handheld Cardiac Ultrasound in Resident Assessment of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction in Outpatients - Protocol number: CARILLON-NCT03142152 Assessment of the Carillon\u00c2\u00ae Mitral Contour System\u00c2\u00ae in Treating Functional Mitral Regurgitation Associated With Heart Failure - The CARILLON Trial - Protocol number: CATALYST-1073-310 Study of Hypercortisolism in Patients with Difficult to Control Type 2 Diabetes Despite Receiving Standard-of-Care Therapies: Prevalence and Treatment with Korlym\u00c2\u00ae (Mifepristone) (CATALYST) - Protocol number: CATALYST-NCT04226547 Clinical trial of atrial fibrillation patients comparing left atrial appendage occlusion therapy to Phase 3 Randomized, Open-Label, Multicenter Clinical Study of CGT9486+Sunitinib vs. Sunitinib With Locally Advanced, Unresectable, or Metastatic Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (PEAK) WATCHMAN FLX versus NOAC for EMbolic ProtectION in the Management of Patients with Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation - Protocol number: CHIMES-NCT04377555 AN OPEN-LABEL, MULTICENTER STUDY TO ASSESS DISEASE ACTIVITY AND BIOMARKERS OF NEURONAL DAMAGE IN MINORITY PATIENTS WITH RELAPSING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS RECEIVING TREATMENT WITH OCRELIZUMAB - Protocol number: CITR Collaborative Islet number: CLASP-IID-NCT03706833 Edwards PASCAL TrAnScatheter Mitral Valve RePair System Pivotal Clinical Trial (CLASP IID): A prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled pivotal trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of transcatheter mitral valve repair with the Edwards PASCAL Transcatheter Mitral Valve Repair System compared to Abbott MitraClip in patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation (DMR). - Protocol number: CLNP023F12301 A multicenter, single-arm, open label trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of oral, twice daily LNP023 in adult aHUS patients who are naive to complement inhibitor therapy - Protocol number: CLR1806-NCT03655236 A PHASE 2, RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED STUDY OF K0706 IN SUBJECTS WITH EARLY PARKINSON S DISEASE - Protocol number: CNTY-101-111-01-NCT05336409 The ELiPSE-1 Study: A Phase 1, Multicenter, Open -Label Study of CNTY-101 in Subjects with Relapsed and Centers of Excellence for Precision Medicine NetworkTM Retrospective Outcomes-Associated Database - Protocol number: COLOPLAST-INTIBIA A Prospective, Randomized Clinical Trial Evaluating INTIBIA, an Investigational Implantable Tibial Nerve Stimulator, Through 24-Months. - Protocol number: COMBINE1-4591 A 52-week study comparing the efficacy and safety of once weekly IcoSema and once weekly insulin icodec, both treatment arms with or without oral anti-diabetic drugs, in participants withtype 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with daily basal insulin.

Volunteering in our trial offers potential benefits, including: - The opportunity to become involved in the testing of a new drug that may have potential to improve your condition - Close contact with the study team for management of your disease - Contributing to medical science, which may help others now and in the future Frequently asked questions - Q: Why volunteer? A: Does volunteering for a clinical trial make sense for you? The following information will help you to decide. - Q: What are clinical trials and why are they important? A: Clinical trials are carefully planned research studies that have led to important discoveries such as new drugs, devices, procedures, biologics, and diagnostic approaches. These new discoveries make our lives better such as new medicines to treat cancer, diabetes, and other diseases. Some other words for clinical trials are research, survey, or experiment. Know what you are getting into and don't be afraid to ask questions. A clinical trial may or may not help you personally. The results from the study could help others who have a health problem. Taking part in research is voluntary. It is your decision! - Q: Why do we need clinical trials? A: A series of clinical trials for each possible treatment must be done before the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will approve a drug, procedure, or device. Many of the trials done at MedStar Health Research Institute are trials testing possible drugs or devices. A drug must be shown to be safe and useful for public use before the FDA can approve it. From the lab bench to the drug store, developing a new drug is a long and expensive process. It is estimated to take about 10 years and $800 million to bring one new drug to market (R & D Directions, January 2002). - Q: Are clinical trials safe? A: Protections have been put in place to safeguard your rights, safety, and privacy in research. Many layers of oversight include an institutional review board (ethical review board), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and periodic monitoring of study data by independent experts, patient advocates, community advisory board members, and community partners. - Screening trials test the best way to detect certain diseases or health conditions - Diagnostic trials determine better tests or procedures for diagnosing a particular disease or condition - Treatment trials test new treatments, new combinations of drugs, or new approaches to surgery - Quality of life trials explore and measure ways to improve the comfort and quality of life of people with a chronic illness - - Q: Who can participate in a clinical trial? A: People with the condition being studied or healthy people can volunteer to take part in a clinical trial. Each study has specific entry requirements such as age or a medical condition necessary for participation. The doctor in charge of the study must review the volunteers' medical history to determine if he/she is eligible to participate based on strict study conditions called entry criteria. - Q: Who is in charge of a clinical trial? A: A medical doctor is usually responsible for carrying out the study according to the study protocol. Before a clinical trial can begin to enroll volunteers, an Institutional Review Board (IRB) must approve it. The IRB is a committee made up of healthcare experts that review each study to protect patient rights and ensure the safety of research volunteers. The IRB also ensures the research is scientifically sound and is involved in the review of safety issues throughout the study. - Q: What is informed consent? A: One of the documents the IRB must review and approve is called an Informed Consent Form. This is provided to volunteers who are interested in participating in a clinical trial program. The informed consent includes everything a volunteer needs to know about the study so that he/she can make an informed decision as to whether or not to participate. The process allows volunteers to ask questions. Volunteers are encouraged to take their time in making a decision before signing the consent and joining the study. You and your family should feel completely comfortable with your decision to participate before you sign the consent. - Q: What are the benefits to being in a clinical trial? A: Once enrolled in a clinical trial, many volunteers find there are a number of potential benefits to participation. These can include: - The opportunity to become involved in the testing of a new drug that may have potential to improve your condition. - Close contact with the study team for management of your disease. - Contributing to medical science, which may help others now and in the future. However, volunteers understand that there may not be any benefit to participating in a study. - - Q: Why do we need diversity in a research? A: Race, ethnicity, age, and other factors can affect how people respond to medicine. - Q: Why do many still feel uneasy about being part of a clinical trial? A: The Tuskegee Syphilis Study and the cancer cells taken from Henrietta Lacks without her knowledge are two reasons for the continued distrust with the African American community. Today, there is low participation in clinical trials from African Americans. We may not know if certain treatments will be effective in this population. - Q: Will my health insurance pay for a clinical trial? A: Federal law requires insurance companies to cover routine costs, which are things you need regardless of a clinical trial. If the study sponsor requires extra testing, they will typically cover the cost. - Q: Can I drop out of a clinical trial and still receive quality care? A: You are in control. If you decide you do not want to participate anymore, you can withdraw at any time. You will receive the same high-quality care at MedStar Health. Your clinical team may ask to continue monitoring you for a period of time to assess effects of the treatment you have already received. - Q: Are clinical trials considered a last-ditch effort for patients? A: Not true at all! Clinical trials allow access to treatments that are up and coming but not yet available to the general population. - Q: Interested in participating in a clinical trial by MedStar Health?
