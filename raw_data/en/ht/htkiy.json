Dr. Britton had opened her remarks by explaining how her research into the dangers of meditation is a more balanced approach to understanding \"the entire trajectory of the contemplative path, and everything that that entails...\" and she explained that, \"we need to be more even-handed, more balanced in our investigations, and begin to investigate the full range of experiences, including the ones that would be considered negative, difficult, challenging, or maybe even problematic.\" Except, she clearly didn't mean that her research would be entertaining the kinds of questions the Dalai Lama would immediately raise, because there is an irreconcilable divide between modern scientific researchers and ancient spiritual traditions whose practices have become the center of focus of research efforts as a result of the recent discoveries that these practices have (or allegedly have) beneficial effects that are valuable in today's cultural climate. In response to a question by the Dalai Lama as to the character of the meditation practitioners she studies, Dr. Britton explains to the Dalia Lama that her work focuses on the mixed use of shamatha (mindfulness) and vipassana (insight) meditation techniques: (Britton) \"Yes, so the practices that I will be talking about today are some combination of shamatha and vipassana, um, so there won't be any kind of heat generating practices or analytical practices that... (smiles) this is very much simpler kind of practice... um...\" (Dalai Lama) \"Well simpler...\" (Britton) \"Ah, ok, (laughs)...\" (Dalia Lama speaks to translator in Tibetan) "}
