The Guardian Path Guardian's approach has been proven to produce the best outcomes for long-term recovery. The motivation stage includes an intervention, if necessary, a thorough addiction assessment, and medical detox. This allows clients to safely and comfortably withdraw from drugs and alcohol. In the motivation stage clients live in a serene residence with a focus on therapeutic growth. The reintegration stage is about a slow transition into life while maintaining a solid safety net if things get difficult. We do understand that not all clients have the ability to complete extended treatment programs. We offer medical detox as a stand-alone treatment option, as well as short-term residential treatment programs and intensive outpatient programs. Addiction Treatment Services Guardian Recovery Network facilities offer a wide array of medical & clinical treatments. Not all treatments are effective for every client, so we employ professional therapists trained in multiple methods. For clients struggling with dual-diagnosis or other mental health issues we offer regular visits with psychiatric professionals and our medical team. If it is effective in treating substance use disorder, chances are it is offered as a therapy at Guardian Recovery Network. Specialty Programs Specialty programs are available at select Guardian locations. These include our executive program, crisis intervention, dual-diagnosis treatment and family retreats. If you are interested in any of our specialty programs please reach out to one of Treatment Advisors to learn more.
