In 2010 he relocated to the Kenai Peninsula and began work as a Primary Care Physician and as a Hospitalist for Central Peninsula Hospital. As he fell in love with the Alaskan wilderness and the abundance of plants, he began his studies and became an herbalist. In 2014 he started to build his own medical space. In less than a year he helped create and build the Holistic Integrative Medicine Clinic and the Alaskan Boreal Herb Shop. Today we see patients and herbal clients in our rustic building on beautiful Loon Lake. Come visit us and enjoy a cup of hot chaga tea in a warm and kind environment. Areas of Practice Primary Care At Holistic Integrative Medical Clinic, we utilize a combination of Evidenced Based Medicine, Functional Medicine, Holistic Medicine, and Integrative Medicine to meet the individualized needs of our patients. Functional Medicine Functional Medicine is a form of medicine that takes into account the interaction of the environment and the patient as well as interactions between our body systems. Functional Medicine identifies the complex mix of causes for illness. For treatment, Functional Medicine utilizes the latest research findings of supplements, diet and other natural tools for restoring balance in the body's primary physiological processes. Holistic Medicine Holistic Medicine is a term used to describe therapies to treat the patient as a whole person. That is, instead of treating an illness as in western medicine, Holistic Medicine looks at an individual's overall physical, mental, spiritual, and emotional wellbeing while recommending treatment.
