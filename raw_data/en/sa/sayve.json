The JA study establishes the link between test scores achieved on licensing exams an d the competencies being tested; t herefore, pass or fail decisions correlate to competent performance. When evi dence of validity based on examination content is presented for a specific professional role, it is c ritical to consider the importance of the competencies being tested. The Joint Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (AERA, APA, and NCME, 19 99) state: Standard 14.10 When evidence of validity based on test content is presented, the rationale for defining and describing a specific job content domain in a particular way (e.g., in terms of tasks to be performed or knowledge, skills, abilities, or other personal characteristics) should be stated clearly. Standard 14.14 The content domain to be covered by a credentialing test should be defined clearly and justified in terms of the importance of the content for the credential -worthy performance in an occupation or profession. A rationale should be provided to support a claim that the knowledge or skills being assessed are required for credential -worthy performance in an occupation and are consistent with the purpose for which the licensing or certi fication program was instituted. Purpose of the Job Analysis Study In order to meet the aforementioned standards, it is essential that examination content be examined periodically to ensure that existing outlines continue to cover the knowledge, skills a nd abilities (KSAs) required for competent practice in the occupation or profession of interest. To this end, t he National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM )\u00ae, worked with Schroeder Measurement Technologies, Inc. (SMT), to conduct a job analysis of the existing Foundations of Oriental Medicine (FOM), Biomedicine (BIO), Acupuncture with Point Location (ACPL), and Chinese Herbology (CH) examination s. The job analysis included establishing and implementing an online survey instrument that described t he performance activities (task elements ) and KSA s required of a competent acupuncture and Oriental m edicine (AOM) practitioner . Based on the results of the survey , the NCC AOM evaluated the need for a content update for the existing FOM, BIO, ACPL, and CH examination s. This report provides an overview of the survey design, analysis, and results. Survey results of demographic data are displayed graphically. In addition, the i mplications of these results on examination development are discussed. 4 Survey Methodology Survey Development The online survey was developed using task elements from the existing FOM, BIO, ACPL, and CH examination blueprint s. The survey contains five se ctions: one demographic section and one job domain section for each of four previously mentioned examination titles. Together, the panel and SMT developed the following survey parts in a job analysis (JA1) meeting held from June 23 to June 24 , 2012 : Task element list Survey rating scale Demographic questions A copy of the survey appears in Appendix A and the list of JA1 participants appear s in Appendix B. Task Element List and Survey Rating Scale The following frequency and importance rating scale s for the job domains section of the survey were used : Frequency : Importance: 1 = Rarely (<10% of Patients) 1 = Of No Importance 2 = Sometimes (10 -39% of Patients) 2 = Of Little Importance 3 = Often (40 -59% of Patients) 3 = Moderately Important 4 = Usually (60 -80% of Patients) 4 = Very Important 5 = Always (> 80% of Patients) 5 = Extremely Important The following instructions were provided to respondents : This survey should take approximately 1.5 to 2 hours to complete. You may revisit your survey record at any time during the sur vey administration period of January 23 through February 23, 2013. There are 5 sections in this survey: Secti on 1: Demographic Questions. Demographic questions help us develop a profile of the AOM practitioner and t he environment in which you practice. Section 2 -5: Job Domains for Foundations of Oriental Medicine (FOM), Biomedicine (BIO), Acupuncture with Point Location (AC PL), and Chinese Herbology (CH). These sections list tasks 5 and knowledge elements performed or used by AOM practitioners in their work. You are asked to indicate whether or not you perform the element and the importance of each activity to competent practice and public protection. Post-Survey Questionnaire. At the end of Sections 2 to 5, you are a sked to assign weights to each of the job domains for consideration when updating the distribution of content for the FOM, BIO, ACPL, and CH certification examinations. You will also have the opportunity to specify any tasks or knowledge elements you feel may have been overlooked in this survey. Rating Scale s Frequency scale: How frequently do you perform this task in your practice? Please provide a frequency rating using the scale range from \"Rarely\" to \"Always.\" Importance scale: How important is this task or knowledge eleme nt to the practice of an entry - level (one who is in practice at least one year) AOM practitioner? Please provide an importance rating using the scale range from \"Of No Importance\" to \"Extremely Important.\" Demographic Questions In order to determine whether the respondent sample is representative of the practicing AOM population, and if frequency and importance of task elements vary according to respondents ' experience , region of practice , or other factors, a demographic questionnaire was included in the survey . These demographic questions gathered the following information: 1. Gender 2. Age 3. Ethnicity 4. Experience as an AOM practitioner 5. NCCAOM certification 6. Geographical region of practice 7. Primary practice setting 8. Primary group practice setting 9. AOM style practiced Sampling Methodolog y, 28BData Collection and Analyses The 2013 job analysis survey targeted recipients of the following certifications for feedback on the importance of task elements in the FOM, BIO, ACPL , and CH certification examinations: Herbology (FOM, , (FOM, BIO, ACPL , and CH) 6 To ensure maximum validity with regard to responses, a two -tier sa mpling approach was used : Population of al l U.S. States In order to best represent the current state of AOM practice in the U.S., the survey was administered to individuals who practice across the 50 states (plus the District of Columbia). As of January 2013, there were a total of 15,804 active NCCAOM Diplomate practitioners. Columns 2 to 4 of Table C1 in Appendix C show the number of active NCCAOM Diplomates by state and certification type . Note that the states of Alabama, Kansas, North Dak ota, South Dakota, Oklahoma , and Wyoming do not currently have a Practice Act; however, these states were included in the sample. A total of 134 NCCAOM Diplomate practitioners are identified as practicing in these states. Random Sampling Within States The goal of a final sample size was set at a minimum of 1,400 NCCAOM Diplomates. A response rate of 20% was assumed; therefore, 50% of active NCCAOM Diplomate practitioners in each state were invited to participate in the survey. Columns 4 to 6 of Table C1 (Appendix C) shows the number of sampled individuals by NCCAOM certification type. This resulted in an effective sampling of 7,940 NCCAOM Diplomate practitioners. Two weeks into the survey, it was found that the response rate was not what NCCAOM was hoping to achieve; therefore, a decision was made to sample an additional 25% of the NCCAOM Diplomates. Table C2 (Appendix C) shows the number of individuals sampled by state and certificati on type for the second sampling ; 1,980 individuals were sampled in the second round. Also, a convenience sample of 189 non-NCCAOM Diplomate licensed acupuncturists and 3 non-U.S. licensed acupuncturists were surveyed for a total sample size of 10,112. The online survey was available to respondents from January 23 to February 23 , 2013 , a period of approximately four weeks . After the close of the administration window , SMT collected the data and analyzed respondent demographics , task element frequency ratings, and importance ratings using SPSS\u00a9 version 20 .0 and Microsoft Excel\u00ae 2010 computer programs. A total of 1,571 individuals responded to the survey , which resulted in a final response rate of 15.5% . 7 Survey Results Results are divided into three sections: 1. Survey Adequacy and Reliability Information 2. Demographic Results 3. Frequency and Importance ratings Survey Adequacy and Reliability Information Survey Adequacy At the end of each job domain section , respondents were asked to rate the effectiveness of the survey in identifying essential task elements performed by an AOM in the associated job domain . Table 1 shows a summary of survey adequacy by examination title. How well did this survey cover the import ant tasks performed by an entry -level (one who is in practice at least one year) AOM practitioner in relation to FOM/ BIO/ACPL/CH in his or her work? Drop -down list: Completely Adequately Inadequately TABLE 1.

If survey respondents selected \"Inadeq uately\" for this question, they were asked to indicate why they selected that option and were provided with a text field to provide comments. These free -text responses, without any edits, can be found by examination title in Appendix D . 8 Missing Task Elements and KSAs At the end of each job domain section, r espondents were asked for feedback on task and knowledge elements that they felt were missing in the survey. In the space provided below, please specify the job tasks or competencies that you feel were not covered in this survey but are important for an entry -level (one who is in practice at least one year) AOM practitioner to perform or understand in relation to FOM/BIO/ACPL/CH . These free -text responses, without any edits, can be found in Appendi x E. Survey Reliabili ty The Cronbach's Alpha reliability estimate was calculated to evaluate the internal consistency of the task element ratings . This statistic is bound between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating higher reliability, mean ing that ratings obtained from the survey are reliable and consistent . As a rule of thumb, reliability estimates above 0.7 are considered acceptable . Table 2 shows the reliability of frequency and importance ratings by examination title. TABLE 2. Survey Reliabilit y Title Frequency Importance FOM 0.93 0.95 ACPL 0.92 0.96 CH 0.97 0.97 CH Herbal Formulas - 1 For this survey, Cronbach's Alpha was at least 0.92 for both the frequency and importance ratings, indicating that the ratings obtained were reliable. 9 Demographic Results Gender The respondent group was made up of approximately 1093 females (70%) and 461 males (29%).

The frequency scale ranged from 1 to 5 with a \"1\" indicating that the tas k was \"Rarely\" performed (defined as being performed on less than 10% of patients), and a \"5\" indicating that the task was \"Always\" performed (defined as being performed on more than 80% of patients); the importance scale ranged from 1 to 5 with a \"1\" indi cating the task was \"Of No Importance\" and \"5\" indicating the task element was \"Extremely Important.\" Appendix H shows the mean frequency and importance ratings of task elements and its associated standard deviations for each examination module; Appen dix I s hows the differences in importance ratings between geographical regions and years of experience for each examination module. In the following sections , the decision criteria used by the SME panel for including/excluding task elements and determining content domain weights in the final content outline for each examination module are discussed . 20 Foundations of Oriental Medicine Mean Frequency and Importance Ratings All task elements had mean importance ratings of at least 3 (\"Moderately Important ,\" Table H1, Appendix H ), except for \" Triple Heater (San Jiao) differentiation \" under the domain, Treatment Principle a nd Strategy , which had a mean importance rating of 2.95. This element also had the lowest mean frequency rating of 2.52. A total of 13 task elements had mean importance ratings of at least 4.0 (\"Very Important\"). The most important task elements (at least 4.50 ) were: Domain 1: Clinical Examination Methods Chief complaint Health history (including the \"Ten Questions\" [Shi Wen] ) The majority of task elements had mean frequency ratings of at least 3 (Often (40 -59% of Patients) , Table H1, Appendix H ); a total of five task element s had mean frequency ratings of less than 3 , these were: Domain 2: Assessment, Analysis and Differential Dia gnosis based on OM/TCM Triple Heater (San Jiao) differentiation Four Levels differentiation (Wei, Qi, Ying, Xue) Domain 3: Treatment Principle and Strategy Triple Heater (San Jiao) differentiation Four Levels differentiation (Wei, Qi, Ying, Xue) Six Stage s differentiation (Tai Yang, Yang Ming, Shao Yang, Tai Yin, Shao Yin, Jue Yin) Subgroup Analyses In order to determine whether the importance ratings of task elements vary according to respondents' geographical region of practice and years of experience, the mean importance ratings were compared across these factors (Appendix I) . Tables I1 and I5 show the differences in mean importance ratings for the FOM survey by geographical region of practice and years of experience respectively. Differences of 0.5 or more in mean importance ratings between regions and experience categories were flagged (highlighted in orange). Note that the elements in Tables I1 and I5 are sorted in decreasing order of difference between the largest and smallest mean importance ratings . 21 In the subgroup analysis for region , four task elements were flagged. These elements are: Domain 2: Assessment, Analysis and Differential Diagnosis based on OM/TCM Root and branch (Biao Ben) Domain 3: Treatment Principle and Strategy Root and branch (Biao Ben) Channel theory (Jing Luo) Five Elements (Five Phases/Wu Xing) No task elements were flagged in the subgroup analysis for experience. Domain Weights Survey respondents were asked to assign a percentage to each of the three content domains of the FOM examination , reflecting the proportion of examination content that should be written to each domain. Table 4 contains descriptive statistics of content domain weights. TABLE 4. Descriptive Statistics of FOM Content Domain Weig hts.

The purpose of the meeting was to review the NCCAOM FOM survey results, determine the wei ghts for each content domain and its associated subdomains, and to finalize the examination blueprint. Inclusion Criteria Based on results of the survey, the panel decided that individual task elements are required to have a mean importance rating of at least 3.0 in order to be included in the FOM examination: The only task element that did not satisfy the af orementioned inclusion criterion is: 22 Domain 3: Treatment Principle a nd Strategy Triple Heater (San Jiao) differentiation SME Panel Decisions The SME panel proceeded to review the above task element . After additional deliberation on the essential competencies that are required of a n AOM practitioner in relation to Foundations of Oriental Medicine , the panel made the decision to include the above task element even though it did not satisfy the minimum importance criterion . There was further discussion of including Fundamental T heory as a separate subdomain within Domains 2 and 3 on the exam bluep rint; there was consensus among the p anel to mak e these changes to Domain s 2 and 3 to reflect the theoretical framework of Oriental Medicine. In reviewing the c urrent FOM exam blueprint, the p anel also agreed to make the following changes to the Acupuncture with Point Location and Chinese Herbology exa minations : 1. Dietary Principles to be a dded as a subdomain in both the Acupuncture with Point Location and Chinese Herbology examinations. 2. Circadian Rhythms to be include d in the Acupuncture with Point Location examination as a KSA statement . Respondent Comments The SME panel reviewed the feedback and comments provided by respondent s and decided that no additional task elements need to be added. Final Examination Content Outline Based on the above inclusion criteria , subgroup analyses, and decisions of t he SME panel, the final FOM content outline and weight distribution was determined. The weight distribution of the content areas for the updated FOM examination is shown below in Table 5 and the final content outline appears in Appendix J. TABLE 5. Final FOM Examination Weight Distribution. Domain Weight (%) Clinical Examination Methods 10 Assessment, Analy sis and Differential Diagnosis b ased on OM/TCM 45 Treatment Principle a nd Strategy 45 23 Biomedicine Mean Frequency and Importance Ratings The majority of task elements had mean importance ratings of at least 3 (\"Moderately Important ,\" Table H2, Appendix H ) except for the following elements: Domain 1: Biomedical Model Evaluate cognitive function (using tools such as mini mental status exam) Perform deep tendon reflex exam to determine neurological impairment Perform a sensory evaluation to determine neurological impairment Perform cranial nerve evaluation to determine neurological impairment Evaluate cerebellar function (using tests of coordinati on such as Romberg's test) Other (e.g., EMG, EKG) A total of 28 task elements had mean importance ratings of at least 4.0 (\"Very Important ,\" Table H2, Appendix H ). The most important task elements (at least 4.50 ) were: Domain 1: Biomedical Model Determine appropriate course of action (including need for referral) Domain 2: Safety and Professional Responsibilities Management of office emergencies (e.g., burns, seizures, falls, anaphylaxis) Infection control (e.g., bloodborne pathogens, communicable diseases, universal precautions) Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Reporting Requirements Ethics and professional conduct (e.g., informed consent, conflict of interes t, negligence, boundary violations) Interprofessional interactions Patient and public communication The mean frequency ratings for BIO task elements ranged from 1.28 to 4.62, and the majority of task elements had frequency ratings less than 3 (135 of 165, 82%). It should be noted that most of the elements with low frequency ratings were associated with the Pharmaceuticals, Supplements, and Clinical Assessment and Differential Diagnosis Process subtasks. Subgroup Analyses In order to determine whether the importance ratings of task elements vary according to respondents' geographical region of practice and years of experience, the mean importance 24 ratings were compared across these factors (Appendix I) . Tables I2 and I6 show the differences in mean importanc e ratings for the BIO survey by geographical region of practice and years of experience respectively. Differences of 0.5 or more in mean importance ratings between regions and experience categories were flagged (highlighted in orange). Note th at the elemen ts in Tables I2 and I6 are sorted in decreasing order of difference between the largest and smallest mean importance ratings. In the subgroup analysis for region, 20 task elements were flagged. These elements are: Domain 1: Biomedical Model Laboratory (e.g., blood, urine, sputum, stool, saliva) Immune Modulators Respiratory Tract Infections (e.g., sinusitis, viral infection, strep throat, bronchitis, pneumonia) Obstetrics Pancreatic disorders diabetes) Hyperlipidemia (e.g., H. Pylori, Campylobacter) Hemorrhoids Hepatitis Sexually Transmitted Infections Childhood infectious conditions (measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis) Foodborne illness Skin cancers (e.g., basal cell, squamous cell, melanoma) Stroke Concuss ion and traumatic brain injury (TBI) Recognize ominous signs (e.g., medical, mental health, abuse) Determine appropriate course of action (including need for referral) No task elements were flagged in the subgroup analysis for experience. Domain Weights Survey respondents were asked to assign a percentage to each of the two content domains of the BIO examination, reflecting the proportion of examination content that should be written to each domain. Table 6 contains descriptive statistics of content domai n weights. 25 TABLE 6. Descriptive Statistics of BIO Content Domain Weights. Domain N Minimum Maximum Mean (%) Biomedical M odel 949 0 95 57.17 Safety and Professional R esponsibilities 949 5 100 42.83 Decision Criteria for Determining BIO Examination Blueprint Inclusion Criteria The panel decided to set the minimum mean importance and frequency threshold to be 2.75 and 2.50 respectively. All task elements, with the exception of all physiological conditions , are required to satisfy both these minimum inclusion criteria in order to be included in the BIO examination ; physiological conditions were only subject to the minimum frequency requirement. Of the task elements not associated with physiological conditions, the following did not sati sfy the minimum importance and frequency criteria : Domain 1: Biomedical Model Evaluate cognitive function (using tools such as mini mental status exam) Perform muscle strength testing to evaluate muscle weakness Perform deep tendon reflex exam to determin e neurological impairment Perform a sensory evaluation to determine neurological impairment Perform cranial nerve evaluation to determine neurological impairment Evaluate cerebellar function (using tests of coordination such as Romberg's test) Imaging (e.g., x -ray, MRI, CT) Agents Cough medications Blood Thinners/Clotting Control Heart Rate and/or Rhythm Regulating Angina medications Osteoporosis medications Hormonal Replacement Therapy Sexual Dysfunction medications 26 Anti-nausea medications Stool Softeners/Laxatives Anti-diarrheal medications Antibacterials Antivirals Antiprotozoals Antifungals Cancer medications Topical Skin medications Smoking Cessation medications Appetite Control/Weight Management medications Drugs of Abuse Anti-Parkinson medications Anti-seizure medications Amino acids Mood support (e.g., St. John's wort, Sam E, 5 HTP) Western herbs (e.g., saw palmetto, milk thistle) Homeopathic remedies The majority of physiological conditions did not satisfy the minimum frequency criterion (66 of 91, 73%). SME Panel Decisions The SME panel proceeded to review the above list of eliminated task elements. After additional deliberation on the essential competencies that are required of an AOM practitioner in relation to Biomedicine , the panel made the decision to include all of the above non-physiological condition task element s (with the exception of Homeopathic remedies ), even though they did not satisfy the minimum importance and frequency criteria. Of the non -physiological condition task elements that did satisfy the minimum inclusion criteria, the panel decided to remove the following from the final BIO e xamination outline: Domain 1: Biomedical Model Perform active and passive range of motion testing to differentiate the cause of a patient's complaint The following task elements were combined to create a KSA statement to be included in both the Pharmaceu ticals and Supplements sections in Domain 1: 27 Domain 1: Biomedical Model Mechanism of action Adverse effects With respect to physiological condition task elements, the SME panel decided to include the full list of physiological conditions appearing on the survey even though the minimum frequency criterion was not satisfied.

For example, normally a pathogenic factor is not relevant, but if a patient walks in with a cold, then it is completely relevant/important. Were taught to apply the diagnostic method that fits the s ituation, so asking how important they are is just odd. very vague Your surveys are too long. Its not about which style, method, or process you use to heal a patient its about the know, like, and trust you cycle. All the acupuncture in the world wont he lp someone if they dont connect with you. - People skills and the ability to accept all styles of treatment and not have us at one another coz you want to do another test for us to have to pass. ; ; We should be a profession - not a group of levels of test s. Not many questions related to Worsley FIve Element The proper and academically accepted translations of Qi and Mai have to be included in all TCM medical exams. This will breathe some substance into the unfortunate \"New Age, energy label\" which has been given our medicine. see above. OM practitioners need to be able to communicate and refer to (as well as receive referrals and discuss cases with) Western medical practitioners and behavioral health practitioners. Patient interaciton is missing. Prop er diagnosis should be emphasized more. As a Worsley 5E practitioner, the tasks are not relevent at all. The vast percentage of acupuncturists are in private practice. Skill in the medicine is only a beginning. This part makes no sense. 50% of new grad uates who who pass NCCAOM exams quit practice within 5 years because they cant manage a practice. There is more to this work than being a good clinician. important part of participation with other providers and as a healthcare professional. It wasnt cove red and is necessary for practicing. As above noted, and course needs to include study of Feng Shui There are many aspects to running a successful practice as well as communicating with MDs, Insurance companies, etc. physical assessment and treatment based you dont ask if i am in business or out of business, and why we would be out of busneess. I am not going to scrap by in this life to perform medicine. nor do i need to become like a used car salesman in order to promote a practice of medicine. your association and the fsoma (or any florida group) do nothing for the advancement of asian medicine with the AMA (you know them the American drug pushers group/insurance owners). after working 6 years with a mediocare salary i went back to money Question ar e too basic and exclude many of the methods used by Five -Element. Little distinction between 5 phase and 5 -element physical exam?? assuming that \"TCM\" is Chinese medicine - bad history; not accounting for doing several traditions or disciplines in a sing le visit. What about nutrition that is not \"OM\" etc.? 63 all theory no substance Failed to cover communicating with the patient. No differentiation between Acu treatment versus herbal treatment strategies. These two are mutually exclusive. Two different basis of treating disease. FOM should frame around western diseases as well as competency with regards to understanding TCM, AOM, 5E, CCM, EAM etc. especially at the entry level. overly generalized It seems to me that this should be a list of competencie s with a scale to rate importance. does not specify importance of clinical experience during the educational period (prior to entering private practice) these competencies are mostly theoretical and dont get at the soft -skills a practitioner needs - like how to connect and disengage with patients, or how to give realistic expectations about treatment see above statement When you are asking for salary specify acu or other. The preceding questions asked about other professions so it could be misleading It makes assumptions re: Chinese medicine that are inaccurate. too many items to check. It does not cover the methods of follow -up, developing a treatment plan, measuring outcomes. Survey did not reflect the realities of integrative practice The job of being an acupuncturist involves much more than acupuncture theory. See above. 64 BIO Section didnt explicitly include biomedical differential diagnosis or detailed medical imaging. The survey questions are murky, are you asking whether I biomedically di agnose patients ? They come to me with biomedical diagnoses already, I only treat according to East Asian Medical principles and my client base over 23 years has included all the biomedical diagnoses listed. The percentages were hard to work with. I cant imagine a practice where I could say \"60 -80% of my patients have kidney stones.\" So, I just answered according to the first three word -labels, meaning on occasion, regularly, and often for conditions I treat. See above -- woefully unclear question format, really cannot give useful answers. Question format is ambiguous Section C was confusing. Not sure what you wanted to know. I answered the frequency section according to how often I encounter that symptom/condition. As for the importance of recognizing a Biomedical condition it is only important to recognize those that require emergency intervention. Otherwise I dont feel that the Biomedical condition is important to competent TCM treatment. not quite sure what you are seeking in this section extremely di fficult to apply We are CHinese medicine practitioners not doctors. What are you asking? I was confused about the portion in blue. Were you asking how likely i thought it was a first year would see these problems? or how often I saw them? or something el se. found it impossible to answer realistically within the parameters See above comment. Its important to know something about all of those areas, but I assumed the questions relate to acupuncture. The answers may b different if they are about prescribi ng herbs. As stated above. asdasx Why were there so many questions about biomedicine as opposed to oriental medicine? See above comment. Osteoarthritis might be moderately imp in terms of life threatening, but to the ind patient who cannot walk well, and who needs this to remain independent, this is extremely important! Too much emphasis is being placed on diagnosis that is not ours to make! This should be left up to the MDs and Specialists. Basic knoweledge is sufficient which comes with education, c linical experience and practice. We need to focus on what WE do and implement the tools we have been trained in to administer Chinese Medicine. This part makes no sense. It is unclear from the way the questions are asked if we are answering based on whether a practitioner should be able to treat or simply recognize these conditions. The term \"task\" is a fairly non -specific reference, and allows for interpretation that is too open. Im not sure that you could call the results of this survey valid. I fin d the framework of the questions very concerning to that end! pathology; lab tests Confusing - asking what percentage of patients and how important. Yes, I need to know red flags to refer or call 911 and yes I need to know Clean Needle Technique and prop er handling of patient information. I dont feel this method of gathering information about percentages and importance captured this information. You seemed more focused on particular biomedical conditions than what might or might not be useful for me in my everyday practice. I feel the whole section needs to be rewritten. I really didnt understand how to answer the questions properly given the insturctions. I do not practice in a primary care State and do not perform examinations that I consider outside my scope of practice. They are of clinical relevance, but that information is provided by the patient from their doctor. I think an entry level practitioner who has no biomedical experience/background is not prepared in any way to be responsible to practice TCM with biomedical/allopathic responsibilities as this survey might suggest. Who can legally order tests, perform them, and/or interpret them without a high level of training and certification? To 65 suggest otherwise is irresponsible. SCOPE OF PRACTICE sho uld be practiced and consequences of practicing outside of that scope should be taught as well. Some of the questions were not clear, and seemed out of the scope of practice for Acupuncturists, relating to the question of performing tasks. I am not if I a nswered this section appropriatley Too much focus on pharmaceuticals not enough on musculoskeletal shit you just lost all my verbage here. how to stop this nonsence. This section was very poorly written as far as instructions. Previously in the survey F REQUENCY related to how often we performed an element. In this section what element would be performed for conditions like leukemia??? Are you expecting a Test? And if so what test since there are many? Are you asking if we treat the condition? If so the i nstructions were unclear. It seems you are asking how often we use the information collected to recognize the disease. the topic was extraordinarily thorough, but the specific questions were confusing and possibly contradictory. It wasnt so much that the coverage was inadequate, but the whole set up was confusing! I decided to interpret the 2 categories of 1 -5 scale questions as trying to distinguish between how often I actually see something in my practice compared to how important I think it is for a pr actitioner to know (so, say, in regards to a stroke, I see them rarely in practice, so 1; but its very important to recognize the signs if someone is having a stroke in ones office, so 5. The way questions are conveyed and the quality of the questions. not clear as to occurrence vs importance; infrequent may be very important. Allopathic disease constructs are not the whole of biomedicine. Survey was difficult to answer for my practice...were you asking the frequency of my needing to address an issue (i.e., office falls), or the importance to which I assign appropriate response, and prevention? Too many unnecessary bio categories. if possible, my actual % above would be 25 -30 total for the exam and needed to be in practice. too much emphasis on making Western diagnosis for which we are generally not licensed and inadequately trained to do. The programs and exams are becoming more and more weighted towards biomed/integrated practice rather than honing skills to communicate and practice the alternative th at is AOM. If we wanted to practice Allopathic, we would go to allopathic med school. Confusing.; What are you trying to get at? Do you want practitioners to recognize various diseases, etc? This was very unclear. I was very confused about what was being asked of me concerning the frequency of administering these tasks. I feel the wording of the response choices in the survey was poor. \"How often do I perform kidney stones?, etc\" It wasnt clear if you were asking if I treat this condition, diagnose this condition, or what. I see and treat many things that have been diagnosed by medical professionals. In fact, more than 90 percent of my clients come having had extensive medical evaluations. I do not diagnose or interpret a patients considtion using wester n terminology. I am not licensed to do so. If I see something Chinese Med cannot treat or something serious, I refer out. see above I honestly had no idea what you meant by this tedious survey. \"Angina\" is not a task. Do I evaluate every single patient for every single possible biomedical illness? Of course not. But if there are signs/symptoms that indicate that there is a problem somewhere, I follow that path and evaluate (and refer) as appropriate. RARELY does that actually occur. ALWAYS I am alert to the possibility. I am not an MD and do not wish to pretend to be one by performing biomedical tests. Questions not relevant to real -world clinical scenarios. the question The frequency with which you perform each element is not adequate - I often do I pe rform Oncology, or recognize ominous signs - of course I look at my patients, ask questions, but have never seen ominous signs of abuse. Maybe a better question. Another point. I RECOGNIZE the importance of management of office emergencies, but I have neve r had to IMPLEMENT any plans - not sure how to answer. too many items to read and check. 66 I dont do many of the procedures or diagnoses covered; I provide supporting role which was not covered here. Focuses too much on Western Biomedicine. Need to recognize red flags for referral, not engage in Western diagnosis. Instructions very unclear. For example, what exactly am I being asked about the \"frequency\" of \"mechanisms\" of drugs or vitamins?; Much of this whole section made very little sense to me. I guessed at what you trying to find out. Acupuncturists are not providers of biomedicine. This survey seems to reflect the training in acupuncture schools which is \"just enough to be dangerous\" or more often, obnoxious. This survey was inadequate because it left out the context of real world practice with real world patients who have MDs and are not looking for their acupuncturists to be MDs. 67 ACPL Section What does \"frequency of needle removal\" mean ? Some of these question responses are very unclear. Again, stupid questions!!! \"Needle removal\"? How could we not remove needles from every patient, and how could that not be \"extremely important\"? The format of the survey just doesnt make sense for a great many of the questions. choosing a weigh t of how important a task is how can I say anything other than 100% for each of these? This part makes no sense. It is very difficult to choose what is important because practitioners practice differently. I never bleed patients but my collegue does beca use he thinks it is very effective. I dont burn moxa because I dont want to expose myself to the smoke but it is effective. So these questions, and my answers are relative. For this an every other section there is an issue of referential opacity. It is no t clear what you are referring to with each section, and to attribute percentage of importance to sections that where it is not clear what exactly you are referring to renders this entire survey invalid. The safety section could use some wording clarifica tion to quantify what NCCAOM is trying to assess. this is one long survey where does it end? The questions and and answers dont clearly reflect one another. too long; not clear structure of questions; a waste of time given the silly questions -> bad data Again, the wording in this section made no sense at all. \"How often do I perform needle removal?\" \"How often do I use needle selection?\" Well, how can you do acupuncture if you dont select a needle? \"How often do I practice crisis manangement?\" Well, the answer is either always or never. Ive never had a crisis. I dont really understand how you can get any useable information from this section of the questionaire. too many questions,; we do not have time to read all. Too much focus on Western biomed. Need to know red flags for referral, not how to diagnose. see above 68 CH Section The survey REQUIRED me to answer this page altho i am NOT AOM, i only conduct acupuncture treatments (not herbs, other than my training in patents), ie i am not certified in Chinese Herbology. Stating the importance of a formula is meaningless -- each one is important for a given condition. more on individual herbs rather than just formulas I cannot judge since I am not a trained herbologist. This section of the survey should include a N/A option Much is dependent upon the demographics and climate area in which you practice. Some of the answers in this survey might be misleading due to this. why have this section and noted requirement and then require someone who does not have the necessary certification to respond? Suggest you provide a separate survey. I feel that the optimal outcome of competency based assessment would be to ask these questions based on the current CA exam formulas, which is a very good model to bas e assessment on because it contains the primary formulas and their modifications. It is very dependent on individual style of practice, climate of practice and patient base as to which formulas are relevant to a first year practitioner so that they can bec ome a better practitioner in the years to follow. Extremely silly way of analysis. Shows nothing. Needed more practical knowledge of dispensing, and how to modify. Most of my piers did not feel ready for the real world. Many things. 1. ALL formulas are important to the right patient. 2. Special attention should be made to knowledge of toxic herbs. 3. Patients on multiple medications should not take herbs at all. Efficacy is challenged. 4. Patient compliance changes practitioners approach to herbal treatm ent often. Need more on classical theory and herbs - Shang Han Lun, Wen Bing, Pi Wei Lun etc Some practices dont focus on or ose herbs. Knowledge and ability to apply basic, foundational theories (e.g. from Shang Han Lun) were not addressed Make little sense. I am so sorry, but it was nearly impossible for my eyes to track each herbal formula and stay with the line accross the screen. Next time try breaking them down to at most 5 formulas per block. I do not use Herbs in my practice How is it possible to determine importance of a formula? They are all important for the corresponding pattern diagnosis. There was no spot to check for those of us that dont practice chinese herbology Didnt apply to my license. to basic you dont discuss raw or m aybe you did but really what is the point? what are you trying to achieve with all those buttons to click? to many buttons. not even for 1 ceu will i press that many buttons poor design is poor survey design. Very poor question. What formula isnt importan t when you use it? the questions about frequency of use are ridiculous N/A All formulas are important, depending on the presentation.; Patient must get the correct formula.Asking about importance of each formula seem ineffective to me. Juan bi tang misspelled as Jian bi tang?; see above I do not see the point to discussing the importance of individual herbal formulas. They are only important in the clinical context of a specific pattern of disharmony, whether it is in front of you or not. See above comments. see the tasks and competencies I listed above. Not nearly enough about safety, manufacturing, quality issues, 69 and not enough on more modern understanding and usage of herbs I dont use those formulas I know nothing about this area. The question is not applicable no pharmacology or drug interaction or side effects You offered no opt out of answering this section for practitioners who dont use herbs. As above. However, to survey this particular subject matter would be very challenging w ithout it being many pages long. What percentage of patients are given both acupuncture and herbs. ; Are side effects ever noticed and if they are how are they reported or recorded.; What percentage of patients do you consider non compliant with herbs.; What percentage of patients come in specifically wanting Chinese herbs. The section on each herbal formula was very challenging to answer. 70 Appendix E: Missing Task Elements and KSAs 71 Missing Task Elements and KSAs FOM Section none Clear diagnosis, palpation, business management Practical applications - needle technique, practice of moxibustion How to communicate effectively with other medical care providers and understand there roles in the health care system.

I practice in the style of Kiiko Matsumoto. I feel that palpation of the patient is all important.

New practitioners also need t o know how to communicate with patients, explain what their problem is and how you are going to treat it and how long it will take and they have to have a good understanding of operating a business. This is critical to their success as an acupuncturist. Th e majority of acupuncturists fail because they have little to no experience in these areas. so far fine Referal to MD I think that covers things. business practices (accounting, insurance, tracking expenses, billing, office practices) I think we need more western medicine diagnostic tests taught to us that we can be tested on later.

We are AOM practitioners, not MDs. I have been a nurse practitioner and I dont think it is appropriate to expect us to know much bio med unless you extend the schooling to the level of an NP. I just dont think that is necessary to do AOM. We should know how to recognize serious conditions and refer and focus on AOM not biomed. Its very importan t to have a good understanding of marketing and business. Business management none western medicine tests and interpretation of them. Documentation Group treatment protocols and paperwork possible complications and contraindicatons associated with pa rticular biomedical diagnoses with the use of acupuncture and chinese medicine Am not sure how to best assess this area because the field 10 -39% was really large and the subjective rate of importance/non imp, did not address life threatening or non lifeth reatening, could be dealt with over time, etc. I feel that all health is very important! bio Biomedicine you need to know the red flags in all areas and when to refer Communication with patients can not think of anything It was unclear from the survey whether you wanted the percentage of patients we treat for a condition or the percentage of patients we evaluated for that western diagnosis. none no ongoing continuing education in biomedicine, current trends and latest findings all was covered trigger points How to communicate with Western physicians Herb/drug (common) interactions Which practitioner should be referred to when a specific situation arises. when to refer; when to get emergency help safety is key in medical office and cbc and mri and x -ray reading are very important. more emphasis on infectious disease and drug interactions I think that too much emphasis is being placed on Diagnosis which are already rendered by other Physicians. Most patients come to Acupuncture and Herbs as a last resort...having already been diagnosed by an MD or Specialist. I do not feel that as Acupuncturists it is our job to diagnose according to Allopathic Medicine. We are to diagnose according to 5 Element perspective, and when using herbs according to TCM diagnosis...not allopathic medicine. the last section was difficult to understand how to rate - how often we see & evaluate those kinds of conditions 87 or how often we screen for them or what? ****Please note - unsure if survey wanted to know what percentage of clients I see with these conditions, vs. me being aware of these conditions. I noted that I am aware of all these conditions, although I am not giving them a Western diagnosis. Biomedicine, i.e. western medicine, is not as important as learn ing the intricacies of TCM/OM. i CANNOT THINK OF ANY special testing NONE I feel inadequate to respond to some of the questions since the BioMedical model came after I took the exam Pattern discrimination is the most important and least understood. Ne w practitioners tend to look up disease rather than do patterns blood pressure I thought this section was very confusing and may have been more specific in terms of how often you see a type of person. Less than ten percent is still one of ten patients wh ich as a practitioner is often. The way in which this module was crafted was very confusing, so I am not sure I competed it accurately. Even the relative importance doesnt make sense. A practioner should be responsible for safety & professionalism 100% of the time. Documentation paralysi & tetany none Because most practitioners are not promary care practitioners I dont think this new, intense focus on Biomed is neccessary as NCCAOM seems to think it is. It muddies the waters especially for new practiti noners so that they do not diagnose and treat based on OM, but rather treat based on bio med which is out of the scope of our practice AND not covered by liabilty insurance. my comment is on the educational level.; Needs to be a universal bank of info re: Ethics nationally at all schools.; Possibly: NNCCAOM require that schools use their learning program for Ethics as course work & credit in educational setting: i.e. consistency of information to prepare for boards. N/A It was covered good none no Knowing when to refer out NUTRITION Sports injuries/emergencies Western patient assessment, i.e., importance of vital signs, ability to recognize abnormal lab results and advise patients to refer to western specialists or back to PCM Scope of practice as it relates to biomedicine understand complications of non -pharmaceutical interventions (i.e. surgery, radiation) Understanding Scope of practice - what is allowed in under licensing in the State one is practicing in. appropriate referrals; co-treating patients; sterilization, antisepsis None not sure covered completely you wont accept 0 what a stupid survey. 88 N/A red flags The more information about biomedicine taught the better off our profession will be Both education and testing of inter -professional communication & etiquette is severely lacking Since I do acupuncture and not herbs, I would consider western Medicine drug classifications and mechanisms less important to what I do.; Did not understand what you meant by perform with western Medicine diseases. Did you mean treat people with that disorder? ; I was confused by the BIO section of survey N/A to me, I am a practicing RN Covered Bedside manner. reading of medical tests unclear to me what job task or competency is queried by a list of conditions...ability to dx?

We are not doctors and only need enough medical knowledge to understand what our clients are saying. not practicing No NONE More knowledge of pharmaceuticals history of medicine. ; \"TCM\" ? Chinese medicine; just one school.; What you call \"biomedicine\" is skewed, narrow and allopathic. Pain management and musculoskeletal d/o most important in knowing how to treat. Pts usually already have a western dx most of the biomed areas are irrelevant in the actual treatment of patients using CM theory and diagnosis. Red flags for referrals are important. Beyond that, with the exception of straigtforward musculoskeletal disorders, it is trying to practice Western med without a lice nse. Confuses patients and alienates potential allies in the medical fields. Knowledge is helpful for communicating with other docs, but not for actual treatment using CM. when to refer. Managing medically complex patients ws. needing to diagnose them. wo rking with biomedical providers on coordinating care Lawsuits, regulatory statutes under boards in states that the person will practice, understanding the risks involved of going into practice n/a How to deal with patients who come to you as their \"last hope\". none 89 This whole section makes little sense to me. It is important for us to recognize red flags, etc - rating percentage of patients for each biomedical condition makes no sense. Medical record is very important. examining skin for skin cancer Many patients are unable or otherwise have difficulties with discussing many of the biomedical subjects you raised. The ability of the practitioner to respond in a non -judgmental and supportive fashion falls under professional communication but somehow se ems minimized in the survey. NONE impact of lifestyle on biomedical conditions CLEAN NEEDLE Im fairly certain I answered incorrectly. As it is not in my scope of practice to perform BIO tests or red lab reports, I answered rarely to most of the topics. I do, however, ASK patients about those issues in the initial intake 100% of the time. How to communicate at the level that you can convince a physician when you notice something that is important to bring to patient MD attentions. none It is important to understand areas which are life threatening or dangerous. Yet, in the AOM model, diagnosis and treatment do not require the biomedicine model for results. Understanding and assessment can be helpful, but is not necessary unless in certain fields. asse ssment of what other health care providers a patient is seeing/has seen, and what diagnoses have been received from those practitioners (since acupuncturists in private practice are still seen as a last resort; part of our differential diagnosis needs to i nclude whether a patient has received adequate lab tests from an MD; in the state of Oregon, acupuncturists are no longer allowed to order lab tests, and when we were, they would not have been covered by a patients insurance. More Biomedical knowledge is needed to understand the western patients. none Bio medicine should be taken more seriously if we want to be taken more seriously. Grads come out with biomed understanding that is laughable. Bloodborne Pathogen/Needlestick None relevant to how I practice. not applicable I would like to see some development undertaken to integrate \"bedside manner\" into the professional competancies taught and examined I think entry level practitioners dont need to be an expert in the BIO competencies, but they d o need to recognize when patients exhibit the potential for a serious \"Red Flag\" in the more critical BIO pathologies. This will allow them to do more research or refer responsibility. I really dont think that we need to understand all the western etiolog y unless we are practicing as primary providers in the western and eastern sense. As an acupuncturist I need to eval and treat the pattern, not the western diagnosis. I felt the biomedical portion should have focused on more common disorders and important referrals -- some questions were not very relevant to the average practice. Safety and professional responsibilities also important. Note: very hard to fill inthe blue sectionn accurately -- I answered according to the frequency in which I encounter situ ations. Many I almost never encounter. No I am noticing an outbreak of scabies in my practice and as an intern. I believe this is a critical area that needs to recognized and addressed to government officials to control the outbreaks. ordering labs, communication w/ other modality practitioners 90 not sure HIPAA This survey covered all the core competencies; however, the examination focused almost solely on drug interactions and muscle testing. While this and office safety and privacy is obviously very important, it is very important that people know how to differentiate between Western medical conditions, even though we are NOT permitted to make Western diagnoses. The ability to recognize conditions is critical and the examination did not sufficien tly cover this. referral system to other healthcare providers Although there was a question about whether HiBP was a treated condition, I did not see a question about whether the vital signs (height, weight, blood pressure) were taken at the initial visi t. This is an important question in current practice First Aid, Stethoscope Biomedicine should take about 40% of training activities and Chinese medicine should take up about 60% of training activities. Therefore, testing should reflect this. some things are important for herbs but not acupuncture appropriate referrals excellent Managing a practice takes a huge amount of time. none covered CPR/ FIRST AID well covered all were covered coordinate with other health care providers written communications; ; Differential diagnosis N/A safety issues with adjunct therapies covered Differentiation should be made between diseases that will result in patient death, pain, or contagious disease vs. mild patient discomfort or cosmetic issues. The weight should be on those more important issues. none DRUG AND HERBAL INTERACTIONS GI issue cause by the medicine and vitamine understanding among all models of medicines and complement each other A core competency should be the ability to research what we havent already learned. Our Western training is limited, and in the real world we are faced constantly with new meds and unusual diseases and conditions. The ability to research these unknowns should be a core competency. recognition of medical em ergency is the most important first aid Communication with allopathic/western medical professionals. Determining beginning treatment vs. referral and adjunctive care vs. primary care 91 ACPL Section ok All covered. More on coordinating with western medicine Needle disposal AFTER they are collected in biohazard container. I think point location at determined relief of symptoms is important. All was covered N/A none none The questions are unclear. How often do I perform safety procedures: Always . How often do I manage emergencies: always when they occur. recommendations and limits of number of needles.; addressing deficiency and excess with needle type/gauge/depth/aaction AGAIN, IN EACH OF THE ABOVE TOPICS THE PRACTITIONER SHOULD GIVE 100% no. n/a how often do you consult acupuncture manuals? They covered all Hara diagnosis Always be honest with your patient. Tell them when you can help them and when you cant. When you cant help, find them someone who can. When you can help and they are better, tell them they have completed treatment. Theyll come back when something else is wrong so dont try to hold them hostage forever. Safty is included in the patient management It is adequate Co treat with other health care providers None POINT LOCATION multiple modality treatment planning and evaluation of all supplements and other therapies that patient is undergoing while receiving acupuncture. Many practitioners use approaches like Master Tung, and that would have been good to have had expo sure to while in school sensitivity to patients that have been abused as to palpation and point location, nonverbal cues of pt discomfort More emphasis on boundary work/ dealing with patients with spirit issues n.a. covered well. Japanese treatments have different priorities for treatment modalities. Not addressed at all. draping, communication of boundaries, privacy The use of microsystems or other acupuncture systems, i.e. - Tung/Tan None Coordination of care with allopathic providers. Proper u se of PPE for various modalities Here again the questions are hard to answer. I use cupping when it is indicated. When it is indicated and you 92 dont have other treatment skills it becomes very important. The focus needs to be on needle and moxa therapy. \" Acupuncture\" is not a Chinese word. The Chinese name is \"Zhen\" (needle) \"Jiu\" (reference to Moxa). Other modalities like Qigong, guasha dont need much emphasis and are not a part of the original system. so far fine The understanding of tonification and sedation techniques may vary by style. The survey was unclear if you meant TCM VS other. It was fine. Dont feel confined by clean needle technique, you will never get all your points properly if you keep swabbing with alcohol all the time. It is importa nt to know the various tools available, but it is practice that will lead to intuitive treatment. none n/a nothing to add None they need to know everything building relationships with other practitioners for referral and complimentary treatment acpl none n/a this section is poorly constructed for instance with respect to safety, I always handle properly, but I rarely have an office emergency. n/a all covered dx by looking at ear? Pt safety is a primary concern; if implemented correctly, and preventitively, actual response to safety concerns will be minimal, you need to ask whether patients has hepatitis B or not. extremely important, HIV postive and Aids are most dangerous disease. I think even more emphasis on proper point location is desi rable. pulse change upon hitting the chi Safe is not that hard. You just have to do it exactly, always. Figuring treatment plans is much harder. mOST of these questions refer to TCM, not 5 element theory Communicating with other health professionals an d establishing a shared treatment plan with other providers. Auricular (Ear Acupuncture) Point Locations none More focus on safety.; Do not harm patients Hara diagnosis/treatment none it is very diffuult to choose what is important because practitioners practice differently. I never bleed patients but my collegue does because he thinks it is very effective. I dont burn moxa because I dont want to expose myself to the smoke but it is effective. So these questions, and my answers are relative. NA n/a 93 Some questions, such as emergency management, were unclear, I checked rarely because I dont usually have to deal with these issues but I do have the knowledge to deal with them as necessary. good none no N/A antisepsis; clean needle; technique; needle insertion; techniques none not sure adequately covered how to complete i dont write your tests, i dont create the questions. i dont appreaciate mds who do ap work with little to no training...get some leadership...explaing to the publ ic,...oh dont do that it might upset a congress man lobiests.. N/A It matters to get the point ! Point location - wasnt sure if you wanted to weight the different point location methods as mutually exclusive (as in I measure in cun vs palpation) or if you wanted to know if I used all some or few of the methods. I find it odd that pulse taking was not listed on evaluation or used to determine if a point will be successful. Patients perception of pain from different points. Need more specifics about me thods. Luo or junction points are used in five phase and Worsley but in different ways Working with Health Insurance Companies, and paying Taxes NONE patient education Washing Hands Clean Needle Domain II Safety section was unclear: could be interpret ed as Rarely never happens < 10%, or Yes apply standard of care to 80 -100% of patients. Although still considered extremely important. no na ok nothing not practicing No NONE Need for nerve locations and blood vessels during course study for needling Again, for my practice, are you asking how often I experience office emergencies such as burn, organ puncture, or how important it is to me to practice safely in order to avoid those things? My response to the first would be (0-10%), and the seco nd (100%), which is how I answered. Need to clarify! counting out needles n/a none All covered. cant think of any I understand this may be controversial, but clean needle technique is neither ethical or related to safety in my 94 opinion. Alcohol does not clean or sterilize and unless the patient is quite dirty (literally) it does nothing more than move dirt around and provides a false sense of security relative to safety. There should be more emphasis on approaching and best practices with patients tha t havent experienced needling before (both before treatment begins and after treatment session is completed) n/a none If entry level practitioners have good safety habits, we are all better off. It is rare in practice if one is taught correctly. none TCM is useless.

More information on herb companies and FDA. Im not an herbalist, so cant answer appropriately. Covered well N/A Many of these formulas contain illegal or herbs that are hard to obtain. I mostly make my own personal formulas and think practitioners should customize for most patients.. Chinese dietary advice is useless. Plant based diets save lives and improve what life ther e is in the ill. Our profession should not promote things that are not supported by science. TCM dietary information should be academic only. Never useful in the clinic. none Not certified in herbs none Allergies, contraindications, general categories of herbs and their uses.; Entry level cant know it all, it takes time. Different herbs are important for different kinds of practices/patients. Some practitioner using a patent formula but only one herb in this formula is the one he needs. In order to satisfy his own formula, he use many patent herbs and ignore other herbs effect in the patent herbs. n/a They covered all Understanding the status of Chinese Herbology vis -a-vis current State laws - \"rights\" to practice herbal medicine (explicit and implicit/gray areas) use of single herbs, constructing formulas, choosing among competing similar patent formulas wow... sorry, I quit half way thru the formula list. In truth, I use maybe 40 formulas very regularly and the rest whenever I think the need arises. I also only do patent herbs in my clinic due to my demographic of patients. The differences between common herb manufacturers and the dangers of off -brand herbs should be more stressed. Chiese herbology training is just very besic in USA. the cl inical training is not enough at all. The entry lever is needed to raise in NCCAOM. None I DO NOT DISPENSE HERBS IN MY PRACTICE I do not use herbs in my practice. Drug -herb -supplement interactions are critical to know. Most people are on at least one drug, and also use supplements and other herbs. I have not taken herbs and feel unqualified to comment on this section of the exams I think accurate pattern diagnosis leading to a category of herbal formulas and single herbs is crucial for herbal compete ncy. Much more so than any specific formulas or herbs. (Im not sure raw herb questions are relevant; few use them anymore, choosing prepared formulas instead.) compliance I am not a trained herbologist. none Drug -herb interaction and contraindications. Source of herbs prescribed to patients. finding substitutes for herbs we can no longer access (ma huang, xi xin, etc.) 96 you have included some patent formulas but not others that are important, and formulas that are rarely used w/ those that are commonly used for mastery as a TCM practitioner. See my other comments. Also many practitioners do not dispense formulas or have an herbal pharmacy due to FDA regulations. RIdiculous. ALl formulas are useful under the correct conditions formula s containing restricted substances such as Ephedra or Rhinoceros horn should not be included in the test. Furthermore, an entry level practitioner should not be required to know more than 40 of the most important formulas. These formulas should be chosen b y frequency of use in an actual practice. You could probably get a better idea from survey herb companies on the top formulas they sell. nothing. you covered everything I would have brought up. Herb prep. I refer out to herbalist because I do not practi ce this in my office. That is why on the first page I started by marking formulas as level 1. none n/a this is soooo stupid For an entry level practitioner, the most important skill is to be able to pick the correct formula. Some current research - based usage of classical herb combinations, formulas, single herbs could be included. nothing to add None understanding basic theory - Shang Han Lun, Wen Bing, etc. They must know everything I didnt answer the assessment and treatment section as I rar ely consider or prescribe herbs.

Herbs in treatment cannot be emphasized enough; at least 50% of the strength of TCM treatment is herbs. Most patients want the \"magic\" of the needles, and have to be convinced to try herbs. Almost none want to decoct raw herbs and very few want to drink tea from granulars, so they self -limit the effectiveness. Do you have your own pharmacy? Do you order from an herbal company? Do you send patients to an herbal pharmacy? first, i use korean herbs for my clinic.; a few chinese herbs.; now i use a s ingle herbs. Greater emphasis on herb combinations for complex conditions of modern life. this survey will not let me continue unless I complete the Herbal portion - yet I do not use herbs.

I answered all of the herb questions as moderately important because there is no option for me to note that I didnt ignore this part of the survey. I simply have no knowledge of herbs. I dont prescribe Chinese herbal medicine or formulas,and couldnt tell from the survey if I am meant to comment on this se ction. Although I would love to know the herbs and formulas, and had to study them in school, I dont use them now and have concerns with adequate quality control due to the lack of regulations in China. n/a understanding that which formulas are most likely to be prescribed to patients presenting with chronic illness, which is the majority of our patient base, is key; often patients will already have used OTC or prescribed pharmaceuticals for acute cases. none More emphasis on Shang han za bing lun Herbal education of patient 99 fasting I do not practice Herbology Well covered. not an herbalist not applicable More training in methods to ensure patient compliance - many first year practitioners are frustrated by their patients unwillingness to cook and consume bulk herbs.

I left all but the first section of this portion of the survey blank, not realizing in the first section that I should not answer the herbal questions. i dont do chinese herbology so im not able to answer fully. All of these formulas are important, even if not used frequently. Some of these formulas are important to learn for historical purposes to help understan ding of treatment principles or because they may be useful in the future, although not used now. Pattern discrimination leads to the TCM diagnosis leads to treatment plan. One must not skip ahead or one will make mistakes. The listing of all of these for mulas is bizarre. There is no way to rate these formulas any more than listing all of the acupuncture points and asking for us to rate them. Silly!
