Your stomach, for instance, is higher in acidity in order to break down foods and get rid of harmful pathogens entering the body this way. Your blood, on the other hand, has a slightly alkaline pH. And your saliva's pH level is pretty much pH neutral. If any of these pH levels fall out of balance too much, it could equate to health issues. So what does all this mean for your nutritional health? Many people today have a higher-than-normal acidity level in their body thanks to the processed foods that make up a typical American diet. Eating the wrong foods brings an imbalance to your pH, and as a result, your body will look to balance this acid with alkalizing nutrients found elsewhere\u2014like your bones, for instance. Imbalanced pH levels can lead to a slew of health issues over time, which is why it's important to maintain a healthy diet and keep a balanced pH. Get rid of processed foods First and foremost, you should avoid processed foods\u2014this can't be stressed enough\u2014in order to maintain a healthy pH, but also simply to stay healthy overall. If you're avoiding foods with processed sugars, excess salt and trans fats, your pH levels will naturally be more balanced. Also, it helps to watch your intake of red meats, and meat protein in general, which are acidifying foods and add the imbalance. Choose alkalizing food Of course, subtracting foods is not enough. Root veggies such as sweet potatoes, onions and garlic contain healthy doses of inulin, a probiotic that lowers your digestive pH and aids the body in its absorption of calcium. Leafy greens like kale, lettuce and parsley contain a healthy supply of chlorophyll, which is an alkalizer that helps you maintain a more balanced pH. If you think there is a severe imbalance in your pH levels\u2014you have chronic heartburn or acid reflux, for example\u2014have your pH levels tested. It's important to know where you stand so you can address the root of the issue. Visit our [website](https://naturopathicfamilyhealth.com/) for more information. "}
