The UK Government has set the Grand Challenge of achieving five extra years of healthy older age by 2035, but achieving this will be reliant on innovations in research and health and social care systems that benefit people of all ages and backgrounds. Speakers discussed scientific advances across ageing research, from basic mechanisms that drive ageing through to novel treatments and other interventions - considering how we define healthy ageing and prioritise the most effective research and innovations. The meeting addressed the implications of our ageing population for society, policy, and the health and social care systems. Finally, it considered how healthier older age can be realised through research, policy and other initiatives, exploring the ethical, social and economic frameworks that will be needed to ensure sustainable and fair benefit for all.
