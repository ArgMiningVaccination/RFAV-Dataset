In addition, we have updated the section for how to use essential oils for shingles. According to the Mayo Clinic, shingles is a viral infection that causes painful skin rash. It comes from caused by the varicella zoster virus also known as herpes zoster. It's part of a group of viruses that also causes chicken pox, cold sores and genital herpes (Note: although part of the same group of viruses, the virus that causes cold sores and genital herpes is different than what causes chickenpox/shingles). Once you have the varicella zoster virus it can enter your nervous system and lie dormant; if it reactivates it can produce shingles. Although it's unclear what causes the virus to become active again, it's thought that contributing factors are extreme stress \u2014 such as from the death of a loved one, injury, illness \u2014 such as cancer, medications or other circumstances that lead to a weakened immune system. So your first line of defense for prevention of shingles, is to keep your immune system healthy by means of wholesome food, restorative sleep, a regular exercise program and learning how to manage stress before you're confronted with these triggers. If you're ever tempted to stay home from the gym or not go on that walk, remember it may well be the factor that keeps you from getting this painfully debilitating condition! According to the CDC, there are two vaccines now available for the prevention of shingles and related complications that you may want to discuss with your doctor. Shingles can affect any portion of the body, including the eyes. However, it most commonly often presents as a band of blisters that affects one side of your body, torso, neck or face. Often there is a feeling of pain, burning, numbness or tingling that occurs before a rash is apparent; not all people develop a rash. Symptoms may also include itching, fever, headache, light sensitivity and fatigue. If you suspect that you have shingles, it is important to contact your health care provider immediately, to explore all possible treatment options and ways to prevent long term complications.
