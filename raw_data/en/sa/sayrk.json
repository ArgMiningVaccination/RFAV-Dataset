Correspondence: Hengrui Liu ( hengrui.liu@biocomma.cn ) Abstract Background Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is widely used for allergic rhinitis (AR) treatment. The precision medicine of TCM treatment included 1) syndrome differentiation-based treatment (SDT) and 2) staging-based prescription modifying treatment (ST). This study conducted a randomized, controlled, double-blinded, superiority, non-inferiority, and equivalence clinical trial to compare their therapeutic effect on AR. Methods Participants were diagnosed with TCM syndrome differentiation. Participants in the SDT group received a 6-week regular SDT with different prescriptions. Participants in the ST group received a 6-week ST in which every two weeks were defined as a stage (early, mid, and late) with different prescriptions. The prescriptions were all recommended by the Chinese National Administration of TCM and their therapeutic effects were supported by both classics of TCM literature and modern reference. The symptoms and constitutions related to AR patients were assessed at week 0 and week 6 and followed up after 1 year. SDT and ST in different gender, ages, and syndrome differentiation groups were compared. All the prescriptions in this study were analyzed using TCM components and property analysis and bioinformatic analysis. Results 158 SDT and 159 ST patients were included in the analysis. Both SDT and ST significantly improved symptoms and constitution of AR. ST had a better therapeutic effect than SDT except for \"Lung meridian heat\" patients. Although gender might not affect the difference between SDT and ST, age might be an impact factor. The TCM components and property analysis and bioinformatic analysis provide information to better understand these classical prescriptions. Conclusion For most AR patients, the syndrome differentiation based on disease alteration course over the treatment time was more therapy- critical than the syndrome differentiation based on patients' constitution (or disease subtypes) and syndrome differentiation type and age are affecting factors.

Introduction Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a prevalent nasal condition in the world. Epidemiology revealed that AR occurs in up to 30% of adults and the occurrence goes even higher in children and adolescents (Meltzer, 2016). AR negatively affects patients' life quality, leading to insomnia, mental disorders, and impacts on social, work, and study (Greiner et al., 2011; Schuler Iv and Montejo, 2019). AR and asthma frequently occur together and might interact with each other (Khan, 2014). The therapy for AR is different from that of non-AR and mechanical factors-induced nasal conditions. Conventional modern treatments for AR include anti-inflammatory, symptomatic medication, and allergy immunotherapy. However, anti-inflammatory and symptomatic medications are not fully effective, while allergy immunotherapy is expensive and inconvenient for most AR patients (Hoyte and Nelson, 2018). Thus, many effective complementary and alternative therapies are developed and widely used for clinical AR treatment (Hon et al., 2015). Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is one of the most popular complementary and alternative therapies for AR, especially in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea, and Japan, where TCM is part of the social healthcare system. A study reported that, in Taiwan, up to 50% of patients had been treated with TCM for their allergic conditions and TCM significantly decreased the hospitalization rate of these patients (Lin et al., 2019). Many preclinical studies have shown that TCM has therapeutic effects on AR (Fu et al., 2020; Guo and Liu, 2013) and several clinical tails also suggested that TCM improved AR treatment (Wang et al., 2012). Nevertheless, current studies in TCM for AR are subjected to the general challenge for TCM studies: the complexity of the prescription. This is due to 1) TCM prescription is syndrome differentiation-based, 2) The prescription might vary from doctor to doctor for the same patients, 3) TCM prescription is composed of multiple herbs and contains very complex ingredients. Although modern medicine is evidence-based, while TCM is experience-based, both of them can apply the concept of precision medicine. Broadly speaking, precision medicine includes two precision dimensions: 1) based on the individual characters and 2) based on the changes of the disease over time. For the first dimension, similar to gene-based modern precision medicine, traditional precision medicine is based on TCM syndrome differentiation. Syndrome differentiation, also called Bian Zheng in TCM, is the comprehensive disease subtype diagnosis based on clinical information obtained from observation, listening, questioning, and pulse analysis (Jiang et al., 2012). Thus, the TCM syndrome differentiation considers not only symptoms of the diseases, but also the body constitution of the patients. Conventional TCM treatment for AR is syndrome differentiation-based treatment (SDT), which is precision medicine based on individual characteristics. On the other hand, in the clinical, we have applied another dimension of precision medicine with a staging-based prescription modifying treatment (ST) based on the general pathological changes of AR during the treatment (Ma, 2017). So far, the comparison of these two dimensions of traditional medical precision medicine has never been studied comprehensively. Therefore, in this study, we conducted a systematic superiority, non-inferiority, and equivalence clinical trial to investigate their application for AR treat ment. To avoid the general complexity of TCM research above mentioned, in this study, we considered four syndrome differentiation types, using the most commonly used and proved effective prescriptions. This study provided evidence for the application of TCM in AR management and revealed the therapeutic difference between two dimensions of traditional medical precision medicine for AR. 2. Methods 2.1. Design overview This randomized, controlled, double-blinded superiority, non-inferiority, and equivalence clinical trial adhered to the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials). Participants were enrolled between 18 March 2018 and 1 March 2020, and follow-up ended on 18 March 2021. Written informed consent was obtained on a voluntary basis before the start of the study. The study followed the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethics approval for the experimental protocol was obtained from the institutional review board of the Shenzhen Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital (ethics approval numbers : K2018-037, K2020-031, and K2020-065). We also have already registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (registration number: ChiCTR2100053605). 2.2. Participants This study was conducted at the Shenzhen Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital in Shenzhen, China . Promotional leaflets and posters with the inclusion criteria of the study were distributed at the entrance of the hospital. The subjects were the outpatients of Dr. Wenyang Fu (Fig.1). Figure 1. Schematic presentation of the flow of participants through screening, randomization, interventions, and assessment. 2.3. Diagnostic criteria The inclusion of the participants followed diagnostic criteria for AR as defined by the Chinese guidelines for allergic rhinitis 2015. Briefly, the diagnosis of AR was made when history and physical findings are consistent with an allergic cause and one or more of the following symptoms: nasal congestion, runny nose, itchy nose, or sneezing. 2.4. Inclusion criteria Included patients were required to meet all of the following criteria: 1) patients who meet the AR diagnostic criteria; 2) patients with age 18 years or older; 3) patients who belong to Chinese ethnicity; 4) patients who voluntarily participated in the trial after being fully informed of the study and have signed the informed consent. 2.5. Exclusion criteria Patients who meet the following criteria were excluded: 1) patients who have had any medication for allergic rhinitis for the past three months; 2) patients who are currently receiving treatment interventions for other diseases; 3) patients who have other chronic diseases. 4) Female patients who are currently pregnant and breastfeeding. 5) Patients with abnormal liver and kidney function and abnormal blood system. 6) Simple allergic rhinitis without other nasal diseases, such as sinusitis. 2.6. Withdrawal criteria Participants were withdrawn from this study in the following cases during the 1-year follow-up period: 1) patients who have other medication; 2) patients who occur serious adverse events or reactions; 3) patients who do not wish to continue the study and quit the trial; 4) patients who develop other major diseases during the study period; 5) patients who could not continue to participate in this study for other reasons. 2.7. Sample size The sample size was calculated using the Sample Size Calculator (Chow et al., 2017). According to the preliminary trial and the baseline assessments, we assume that the superiority margin is chosen to be 0.05, the true difference in mean between treatment groups is 0.1, and the standard deviation is 10%. For achieving an 80% power at the 5% level of significance with equal allocation, the minimum sample size for treatment agents and the active control are 50 and 50 respectively. 1= 2=/22(1 ) + 1(1 1 )+ 2(1 2) (1 2 )2 2.8. Diagnostic syndrome differentiation All participants were diagnosed with the TCM syndrome differentiation and divided into four syndrome types before the treatments, including lung qi deficiency cold (LQDC), lung meridian heat (LMH), spleen qi deficiency weakness (SQDW), and kidney yang deficiency (KYD). The criteria of syndrome differentiation were shown in Table 1. Table 1. Diagnostic syndrome differentiation Syndrome type Typical symptoms Face Tongue Pulse Common Special Lung qi deficiency cold (LQDC) Nasal itching, nasal congestion, nasal discharge, frequent sneezing Fear of wind and dread cold, spontaneous sweating, shortage of qi, and weak speaking voice Pale face Pale tongue, thin white tongue fur Vacuous and weak pulse Lung meridian heat (LMH) Nasal itching, nasal congestion, nasal discharge, frequent sneezing Often attacks in sultry weather Sallow complexion Red tongue, white or yellow tongue fur Rapid pulse Spleen qi deficiency weakness (SQDW) Nasal itching, nasal congestion, nasal discharge, frequent sneezing Thin, torpid intake, sloppy stool, weakness of limbs, and shortage of qi Yellow and matt face Thinly fat tongue, teeth marks on the sides, thin white tongue fur Weak pulse Kidney yang deficiency (KYD) Nasal itching, nasal congestion, nasal discharge, frequent sneezing Cold limbs, sore waist and knees, tiredness, and clear and long urination Pale face Pale tongue, white tongue fur Sunken and fine pulse 2.9. Randomization and blinding Eligible participants in each syndrome type were randomly assigned to syndrome differentiation-based treatment (SDT) and staging treatment (ST) groups in a 1:1 ratio. The computer-generated randomization sequence was prepared by an independent researcher not involved in the study and was kept on file. Research personnel assigned participants to the 2 groups according to the random sequence. All physicians, researchers, and patients were blinded to treatment allocation. 2.10. Baseline comparison Shown in the Results section. 2.11. Interventions Participants in the SDT group received a 6-week regular syndrome differentiation-based treatment with different prescriptions. Participants in the ST group received a 6-week staging treatment in which every two weeks were defined as a stage (early, mid, and late) with different prescriptions. The stage is based on a pilot study reported previously ( Ma, 2017). The selections of prescriptions were based on the 2010 Guide to Chinese Medicine Otorhinolaryngology issued by the Chinese National Administration of TCM (Xiong and L iu, 2012). These prescriptions are the most commonly used AR prescriptions in clinical treatment. Some of the pharmacological mechanisms were reported in modern studies as listed in table 2. In detail, in SDT, the prescriptions depended on TCM syndrome differentiation, LQDC, LMH, SQDW, and KYD patients were prescripted for a 6-week treatment of Wen Fei Zhi Liu Dan, Xin Yi Qing Fei yin, Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, and Zhen Wu Tang respectively (Fig.2A). While in ST, the prescriptions were based on the interconnection of viscera and the typical TCM pathology of AR as described in the supplementary materials \"Theoretical bas is and prescription selection\". ST tonified the lung, spleen, and kidney subsequently. The prescriptions for early, mid, and late stages were Wen Fei Zhi Liu Dan, Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, and Zhen Wu Tang respectively (Fig.2B). The four prescriptions in this study were all selected from classics of TCM literature and have long been used in clinical AR treatments since ancient China. Modern studies also reported the pharmacological effects of these prescriptions (Table 2). The detailed theoretical basis of the prescription selection and TCM pharmacological effects of the prescriptions can be found in supplementary material chapter 1 and S-Table 1. Detailed components of the prescriptions were listed in Table 3. Patients took the prescription decoctions orally twice a day, half an hour after breakfast and dinner respectively. All patients and dispensers were blind to the prescriptions. Figure 2. Schematic diagram of the two dimensions of traditional medical precision medicine for AR. A. Syndrome differentiation-based treatment. AR patients were divided into four syndrome types based on TCM syndrome differentiation (LQDC, LMH, SQDW, and KYD) in which patients received different TCM prescriptions for the entire 6-week treatment. B. Staging treatment. AR patients received the same 6-week treatment in which every two weeks were defined as a stage (early, mid, and late) with different prescriptions. The effects and the names of the TCM prescriptions for each group were shown. Table 2.

Prescription production and chemical fingerprints Raw herbs of the prescriptions were provided by the pharmacy of Shenzhen Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital in Shenzhen and authenticated by the pharmacy according to the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (Committee, 2015). Prescription decoctions were produced by the pharmacy. Chemical fingerprints of four prescriptions in this study were generated using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with Shimadzu LC-20AT (Japan). The decoction samples were filtered using a 0.45 Polyethersulfone (PES) membrane filter. HPLC analysis was done coupled with an electrospray ionization source (ESI) and a photodiode array detector. Chemical fingerprints were constructed following the Similarity Evaluation System of Chromatographic Fingerprints of Traditional Chinese Medicine (2004A Edition). Detailed chromatographic conditions were as follows: Wen Fei Zhi Liu Dan chromatographic separation was performed on Waters XSelect Hss T3 column (250 mm\u00d74.6 mm, 5 m) at 25 \u00b0C. The mobile phase comprised a mixture of acetonitrile (A) and 0.1% formic acid solution (B). Linear gradient elution was conducted as follows: 0 -55 min at 3 -11% A, 55-115 min at 11-15% A, 115-155 min at 15-21% A, 155 -225 min at 21%~45% A. The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min and the injection volume was 10 l. UV detection was performed at 254 nm. Xin Yi Qing Fei yin chromatographic separation was performed on Waters XSelect Hss T3 column (250 mm\u00d74.6 mm, 5 m) at 30 \u00b0C. The mobile phase comprised a mixture of acetonitrile (A) and 0.1% phosphoric acid solution (B). Linear gradient elution was conducted as follows: 0 -140 min at 3 -26% A and 140 -175 min at 26%~45% A. The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min and the injection volume was 10 l. UV detection was performed at 254 nm. Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang chromatographic separation was performed on Waters XSelect Hss T3 column (250 mm\u00d74.6 mm, 5 m) at 30 \u00b0C. The mobile phase comprised a mixture of acetonitrile (A) and 0.1% phosphoric acid solution (B). Linear gradient elution was conducted as follows: 0 -80 min at 3 -17% A, 80-120 min at 17-27% A, and 120-162 min at 27%~49% A . The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min and the injection volume was 10 l. UV detection was performed at 254 nm. Zhen Wu Tang chromatographic separation was performed on Waters XSelect Hss T3 column (250 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 m) at 30 \u00b0C. The mobile phase comprised a mixture of acetonitrile (A) and 0.1% phosphoric acid solution (B). Linear gradient elution was conducted as follows: 0 -65 min at 0 -10% A, 65-110 min at 10-24% A, and 110-150 min at 24 %~55% A. The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min and the injection volume was 10 l. UV detection was performed at 254 nm. 2.13. Outcomes and follow- up The outcome assessors were blinded to the group allocation of the participants. All outcomes were assessed before interventions (week 0), after completion of the interventions (week 6), and at the 1-year post-intervention follow-up. All the participants were assessed at week 0 and week 6 in the hospital and followed up after 1 year with a phone-call survey. The scoring table was designed according to the 2015 Tianjin Allergic Rhinitis Diagnostic Criteria . We assessed both typical symptoms of AR and body performances related to AR in TCM, which we called \"constitution\". We included five items of s, (loose stools), and \"Lack of strength\" (asthenia). Each symptom or constitution item was assigned 0-3 points according to the condition of the patient. The percentage of score improvement was calculated with the following equation: Pimprove% =(S before-Safter)/Sbefore\u00d7100% (Pimprove% is the percentage of score improvement; S before is the total score before treatment; S after is the total score after treatment) The effectiveness of the treatment was defined by the percentage of score improvement according to a previous pilot study ( Ma, 2017): P improve% >65% is remarkable, P improve% >26% is effective, and P improve% 26% is ineffective. The effectiveness of the symptom treatment and the effectiveness of the constitution treatment were calculated separately. The detailed scoring table was shown in Table 4. During outcome assessments or intervention contacts, any adverse events related to the intervention that were reported by participants were recorded by research personnel. Table 4: Scoring table Type of score Score 0 1 2 3 Symptom Nasal itching never Intermittent Can be endured Unendurable Sneezing never Only fell it if inhale consciously Intermittent or alternately Breathe through the mouth almost all day Nasal sign (nasal organic abnormalities) Normal Mildly swollen middle nasal concha Moderately swollen middle nasal concha Severely swollen middle nasal concha Constitution Spontaneous Sweating (hyperhidrosis) Never noticeable and never interferes with daily activities Tolerable but sometimes interferes with daily activities Barely tolerable and frequently interferes with daily activities Intolerable and always interferes with daily activities Dread cold ( frigophobia) Never Sometimes Most of the time Always Cough Never Sometimes Most of the time Always Shortage of qi (tiredness) Normal behave Slightly tired, don't want to talk much, and don't want to answer questions, except for being asked.

Analytical approach Double data entry and verification were performed by 2 independent research personnel to ensure data accuracy. Patients with any missing data for unexpected reasons were excluded before the data analysis. Raw data were expressed as mean\u00b1SD. Intention- to-treat analysis was conducted with all randomly assigned participants included in the analysis. Assessments conducted at week 0, week 6, and one year were included as outcomes in the analysis. The covariates were the baseline measurement, the assessment time point, treatment type (SDT group or ST group), syndrome differentiation type (LQDC, LMH, SQDW, or KYD), age groups (divided by the medium), and gender groups. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8. The Chi-squared test was used to compare the effectiveness of the treatments and the t-test was used to compare data in two groups. Statistical significance was set at a P value less than 0.05. 2.15. Prescription analysis and network pharmacology studies All the prescriptions in this study were analyzed using TCM components and property analysis and bioinformatic analysis. In TCM components and property analysis, the prescription properties are defined according to Shennong's Materia Medica , including four qi, five flavors, and meridian entry. The statistics of the four qi, five flavors, and meridian entry were calculated based on the property of the individual medicines in each prescription and weighted by their dosages. In bioinformatic analysis, the list of genes associated with AR was downloaded from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD, http://ctdbase.org/) and the GeneCards (https://www.genecards.org/) respectively. An intersection of the gene set from CTD and the gene set from GeneCards was conducted to identify AR pathological genes. BATMAN-TCM (http://bionet.ncpsb.org.cn/batman- tcm/) was used to identify gene targets of the prescriptions (Score cutoff: 20, p-value: 0.05). The AR therapeutic target genes of the prescriptions were further identified by an intersection of AR pathological genes and gene targets of the prescriptions. These therapeutic genes were further enriched in the GO and the KEGG databases using the Hiplot (https://hiplot.com.cn). The protein-protein interaction networks of the therapeutic target genes were constructed using STRING (https://string-db.org/). The clinical modification of the prescription was not considered in all of the above analyses. 3. Results 3.1. Chemical fingerprints of prescriptions Chemical fingerprints for each prescription used in this study were generated for future reference. Results showed that a total of 20, 17, 27, and16 common chromatographic peaks are matched for Wen Fei Zhi Liu Dan, Xin Yi Qing Fei yin, Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, and Zhen Wu Tang respectively. Figure 3 . Chemical fingerprints of prescriptions. Chemical fingerprints of four prescriptions in this study were generated using HPLC coupled with an ESI and a photodiode array detector. Chemical fingerprints were constructed following the Similarity Evaluation System of Chromatographic Fingerprints of TCM. 3.2. The number of participants A total of 500 persons were recruited for the study after giving informed consent. 465 eligible participants were randomly assigned to the SDT (n=232) or ST (n= 233) groups . Among the 465 participants, 402 (204 in the SDT group and 198 in the ST group) completed the assessment at week 6, and 317 (158 in the SDT group and 159 in the ST group) completed the assessment after one year. 3.3. Baseline comparison Baseline characteristics of participants, including gender ratio, age, disease duration, symptom score (sneezing, nasal discharge, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and nasal sign), and constitution score (spontaneous sweating, dread cold, cough, shortage of qi, torpid intake, lack of strength, and sloppy stool), did not differ substantively between groups. The number of SDT and ST in the four syndrome differentiation types were similar, but LQDC and SQDWS had much more patients than KYD and LMH (Table 5). Because in this study, we also compared SDT and ST in different gender, age, and syndrome differentiation groups, we also analyzed the initial score of these symptom groups. Results showed that baseline characteristics of participants in these groups were not significantly different, except for female nasal discharge with a p-value of 0.0284 (S-Table 2-4). We conducted the SF-12 questionnaire before treatment and there was no statistical difference (S-Table 15). Table 5. Baseline characteristics and scores of participants. Term SDT (n=158) ST (n=159) P Value Male - LMH 16 (10.17%) 5 (3.14%) - 3.4. Overall effectiveness For the symptom assessment, after 6-week treatment, 8% and 25% of patients achieved remarkable effectiveness and 77% and 84% of patients achieved effectiveness in SDT and ST respectively. At 1-year follow-up, 21% and 43% of patients obtained remarkable effectiveness, and 85% and 91% of patients obtained effectiveness in SDT and ST respectively (Fig.4A). For the constitution assessment, after 6-week treatment, 20% and 32% of patients achieved remarkable effectiveness and 77% and 81% of patients achieved effectiveness in SDT and ST respectively. At 1-year follow-up, 23% and 51% of patients were remarkably effective and 69% and 83% of patients were effective in SDT and ST respectively (Fig.4B). These data supported that both SDT and ST had achieved desirable therapeutic effects on AR. We also conducted a Chi-square analysis to compare SDT and ST. Results showed that SDT and ST were significantly different in symptom score effectiveness after 6-week treatment, and they were significantly different in both symptom and constitution score effectiveness after 1-year follow-up. Therefore, ST achieved a significantly better overall therapeutic effect compared to SDT. Detailed data can be found in S-Table 5. 3.5. Overall score improvement We analyzed detailed score improvements of SDT and ST. Results showed that all of the scores significantly increased in both SDT and ST after 6 weeks or 1 year. When we compared SDT and ST, results showed that after 6 weeks, the scores of sneezing, nasal discharge, nasal congestion, nasal itching, dread cold, and sloppy stool achieved significantly higher improvement in ST than that in SDT (Fig.4C-D). 1-year follow-up data revealed that ST showed significantly better improvement in all the scores of symptoms and showed significantly better improvement in \"Spontaneous sweating\" and \"Dread cold\" compared to SDT (Fig.4E -F). These data suggested that ST had a better overall therapeutic effect for AR than SDT, especially in terms of symptom improvements. Detailed data can be found in S-Table 6. After treatment, SF-12 scores improved in both groups, but there was no statistical difference between the groups (S-Table 15). Figure 4. Overall outcomes. A. Effectiveness of symptom score. B.

Effectiveness in different gender and age groups To further investigate the potential factors that impact the therapy of SDT and ST, we analyzed the effectiveness in different gender and age groups. In the comparison of males and females, results showed that ST showed significantly higher symptom effectiveness than SDT in both female and male groups at week 6 and year 1, while ST showed significantly higher constitution effectiveness than SDT in both female and male groups only after one year (Fig.5A-B). In addition, we divided all patients by the age medium (33) and compared younger and older patients. We found that ST showed significantly higher symptom effectiveness than SDT in younger patients but not in older patients. As for constitution score, ST showed significantly higher effectiveness than SDT in both younger and older groups, but only after one year (Fig.5C-D). These results suggested that SDT and ST had a considerable therapeutic effect on different gender and age groups. Although gender might not affect the difference between SDT and ST, age might be an impact factor. Detailed data can be found in S-Table 7-10. Figure 5.

Effectiveness of different SDT groups To reduce the impact of the syndrome differentiation on the therapy and evaluate the therapeutic effect of SDT and ST on different SDT groups, we compared patients with the same TCM syndrome and compared the therapeutic effect of SDT and ST. Results showed that both SDT and ST achieved remarkable therapeutic effects on symptoms and constitutions in all four syndrome differentiation groups. Statistical analysis revealed that, after 6- week treatment, compared with SDT, ST had significantly higher effectiveness in SQDW patients both in symptom and constitution (Fig.6A-B). After 1 year, SDT showed significantly higher effectiveness in LMH patients in symptoms. For symptom, although the remarkable effective rate in SDT was increased by 55% compared to ST group, the statistical analysis showed no significance between SDT and ST groups. For constitution, the remarkable effective rate in LMH was increased by over 30% in ST compared to SDT. However, ST showed significantly higher effectiveness in SQDW patients in symptom and constitution, and also showed significantly higher effectiveness in LQDC patients in constitution compared to SDT (Fig.6C-D). Considering the number of patients and the significance in SQDW and LQDC groups (S-Table 4), we suggested that ST had a better therapeutic effect on SQDW AR both in symptom and constitution, but, for LQDC, ST had a better therapeutic effect on constitution only after a year. Yet, LMH (SDT n=16 and ST n=5) and KYD (SDT n=16 and ST n=14) groups had too few patients to be conclusive. Detailed data can be found in S-Table 11-12. Figure 6.

D. 1-year constitution effectiveness. SDT vs **p<0.01, ***p<0.001. 3.8. Improvement of SQDW and LQDC Considering relatively low patient numbers in LMH and LYD groups, we only plotted the score improvements of SQDW and LQDC. Results showed that, in the SQDW group, 6-week treatment of ST achieved better improvements in sneezing, nasal discharge, nasal congestion, and nasal itching, but had no significant difference in all constitution scores compared to SDT (Fig.7A-B). After one year, ST improved significantly more scores than SDT in nasal discharge, nasal congestion, nasal itching, nasal sign, and dread cold (Fig.7C-D). On the other hand, in LQDC, although the total symptom scores of 6-week and 1-year were significantly different between SDT and ST, there was no significance in the individual scores except for 1-year spontaneous sweating and dread cold (Fig.7E-H). Therefore, we suggested that ST had a better therapeutic effect than SDT in SQDW, especially for the symptom improvement of SQDW AR. Detailed data for all syndrome differentiation groups can be found in S- Table 13-14. Figure 7. Score improvement of SQDW and LQDC. A. 6-week symptom score improvement of SQDW.

Post-clinical analysis of the prescriptions To explore TCM mechanisms for the prescriptions in this study, we conducted TCM components and property analysis. In TCM, the traditional properties of the medicine, including four qi, five flavors, and meridian entry, can partly reflect the therapeutic effect of the prescription. Thus, we analyzed the four qi, five flavors, a nd meridian entry of the four prescriptions. The prescription properties are defined according to Shennong's Materia Medica . The Wen Fei Zhi Liu Dan was mostly composed of medicine of \"normal\", \"sweet\", and \"lung\". These reflected its aim to tonify the yang of the lung (S-Fig.1A). The Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang was mostly composed of medicine of \"warm\", \"sweet\", and \"spleen\" because it aimed to tonify the spleen ( S-Fig.1B). The Zhen Wu Tang was mostly composed of medicine with \"warm\", \"sweet\", and \"spleen\" with a relatively higher proportion of \"kidney\" medicine because it aimed to tonify the yang of the kidney ( S-Fig.1C). The LMH prescription was mostly composed of medicine with \"cold\", \"bitter\", and \"lung\" because it was a prescription for the clearance of lung f ire (S-Fig.1 D). To investigate potential therapeutic mechanisms for the prescriptions in this study, we conducted bioinformatics analyses of the pharmacological networks. We downloaded the list of genes associated with AR from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) and the GeneCards database. To obtain a reliable gene list for AR pathology, we conducted an intersection of the genes set from CTD and genes set from GeneCards. 422 genes were identified as AR pathological genes (S-Fig.2). In addition, we analyzed gene targets of the seven prescriptions respectively using BATMAN-TCM. Subsequently, we conducted an intersection analysis of the AR pathological genes and prescription targeting genes of the seven prescriptions respectively. 139, 55, 128, and 47 genes were identified as the therapeutic target genes of Wen Fei Zhi Liu Dan, Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, Zhen Wu Tang, and Xin Yi Qing Fei Yin respectively (S-Fig.3-6A). These genes were subsequently enriched in the GO and KEGG databases. Results showed that be sides \"response to drug\" and irrelevant terminologies, the therapeutic target genes of Wen Fei Zhi Liu Dan were enriched in \"response to lipopolysaccharide\", \"cytokine receptor binding\", \"DNA - binding transcription factor binding\", and multiple membrane reg ion related terms (S-Fig.3B). The therapeutic target genes of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang were enriched in \"response to nutrient levels\", S- Fig.4 B). The therapeutic target genes of Zhen Wu Tang were enriched in \"smooth muscle cell proliferation\", \"Calcium signaling pathway\", and \"Estrogen signaling pathway\" ( S-Fig.5B). The therapeutic target genes of Xin Yi Qing Fei Yin were enriched in \"regulation of inflammatory response\", \"response (S-Fig.6B). Furthermore, we constructed the protein-protein interaction network of the therapeutic target genes for the seven prescriptions respectively (S-Fig.3-6C). These data provided potential mechanisms of the seven classical TCM prescriptions in this study and facilitate the understanding of these prescriptions. 4. Discussion The SDT is the routine TCM treatment for AR in TCM which has been proven to be effective (Sayin et al., 2013). The four prescriptions were used in SDT as a routine and recommended clinical TCM prescriptions in China [14]. The purpose of this study is to propose a new therapeutic strategy and assess its therapeutic effect compared with the current clinical routine treatment. Regarding the relatively worse compliance of placebo-controlled trials, we conducted a superiority, non-inferiority, and equivalence clinical trial. In addition, the placebo-controlled trials of TCM prescription of traditional decoction were subjected to the difficulty of making an identical placebo in appearance, weight, color, smell, and taste. Some studies extracted multiple water decoctions from the same batch of a single prescription and used the first and second decoctions for the experimental group of patients as the treatment group, and the sixth and seventh decoctions for the placebo group as the control group, others used low-dose same TCM or reduced the major components (Han et al., 2020). Yet, these strategies are not able to rule out the possibility that any active ingredients are still present in the placebo group. Therefore, to avoid the limitations of placebo- controlled trials for traditional decoctions, we did not include a placebo group. In this study, for the first time, we proposed the concept of two dimensions of traditional medical precision medicine. Clinical TCM doctors 1) prescribe based on the syndrome differentiation of patients and 2) modify the prescription based on the changes of the disease during the treatment, which, we called, the two dimensions of traditional medical precision medicine. These two dimensions result in the general challenges of TCM studies. On one hand, clinical trials based on the principle of controlled variables usually can only study one prescription for one certain TCM syndrome differentiation type, which is not able to reflect the overall therapeutic effect of syndrome- based TCM treatments. The value of these trials for modern medicines is limited because the TCM syndrome differentiation is based on a unique TCM theoretical system that is completely different from the modern medical system and TCM syndrome differentiation types have hardly corresponding types in modern medicine. In this study, in the SDT group, we considered the four most comment TCM syndrome differentiation types as a whole to investigate the overall therapeutic effectiveness of TCM treatment on AR, which was more comparable to modern medicines. On the other, most of the current studies in TCM preparation were not able to consider the complexity of prescription modification during the treatment. In the present study, our ST partly reflected the modification of prescriptions in clinical AR treatment, which is the unique characteristic of TCM treatment. Granted, the study was subjected to fixed prescriptions and fixed treatment period, hence the real clinical efficacy of TCM in this study was limited. However, the purpose of the study is to compare two dimensions of the TCM, that is to compare whether syndrome differenti ation based on patients' constitution (or disease types) is more important than syndrome differentiation based on disease alteration course over the treatment time. Only under a controlled condition can we compare, hence, we have to simplify the intervention. While preserving the characteristics of TCM treatment as much as possible, this study enabled the easiest understanding of TCM by non-TCM researchers. Although we provided the TCM theoretical basis for the selection of prescriptions, readers of non-TCM researchers are not necessarily required to understand the complex TCM theory but to know that the selection was experience-based because the prescriptions were selected from the classics of TCM literature and have long been used and proven to be effective in clinical AR treatments since ancient China. Another incomprehensibility for non-TCM researchers is the difference in index items evaluated because some of the terminologies of index items in TCM are different from those in modern medicine. In this study, the symptoms evaluated were easy to understand for non-TCM researchers. For the constitution items, although we used TCM terminologies, we also provided the most similar synonyms in modern medical terminologies for easy understanding in Table 2. Our study revealed that, generally, the ST achieved a better therapeutic effect on AR than SDT. Although gender might not affect the difference between SDT and ST, age might be an impact factor. Results showed that younger patients benefit more from ST than SDT, while older patients showed almost no significant difference. Theoretically, ST, where three stages tonify the lung, the spleen, and the kidney respectively, applied a more comprehensive tonification than SDT to the patients. These tonifications were mediated by the intake ability of the patients. Since the intake ability of older patients was weaker than that of the younger, an extensive tonification might not be absorbed completely. On the other hand, SDT targeted the syndrome more than ST and might exert less additional burden on the patients, hence, it is more conducive to older patients. In addition, because LQDC and SQDWS had much more patients than KYD and LMH, this might introduce a bias in the overall therapeutic effect. Nevertheless, this proportion was consistent with the proportion of the types of AR patients in the clinic. To avoid bias, we analyzed individual syndrome differentiation types. Although the study was subjected to a low number of patients in some groups, results showed that ST had lower effectiveness than SDT only in LMH where this type also had a relatively low patient number, while LQDC is the type that ST achieved better therapeutic effect than SDT with the highest significance. In clinical practice, we feel that ST curative effect is much better than SDT based on experience, this was because there were very few LMH patients and a very large number of LQDC patients. In this study, we found that the selection of SDT or ST for AR treatment should depend on the syndrome differentiati on type of the patients. Therefore, this study provided evidence for the optimization of clinical AR treatment. We also compared the SDT and ST groups before treatment and after follow-up according to the SF- 12 health survey and found that the quality of life of the subjects in both groups was significantly improved, however, we did not find a statistical difference between the two groups, which, we suggested, might due to the ceiling effect. The time point for the assessment in this study week 6 and year 1 was adapted to the onset characteristics of AR. AR onset is mostly seasonal or perennial. Seasonal AR can occur in the spring, summer, fall, or winter, most of which is caused by allergic sensitivity to airborne mold spores or pollens from trees, grass, weeds, or cold air. Perennial AR patients experience symptoms year-round. It is generally caused by daily allergens such as dust mites, pet hair or dander, cockroaches, and mold. In clinical practices, seasonal or perennial AR are difficult to be distinguished, some patients even have both of them. Therefore, in this study, we did not study them separately. The week 6 evaluation determined the direct improvement of the treatment for the AR symptoms and patients' constitution. However, for seasonal AR, if the week 0 evaluation and week 6 evaluation are in different seasons, the determination might be inaccurate, thus, we followed up with the patients after a year. In addition, the 1-year follow- up also reflected the effects of constitutions on symptoms. Unlike modern medical treatment for AR which mainly targets local conditions, TCM treatment has complex and systematic pharmacological effects on patients. Some constitutions had nothing to do with AR in modern medicine, but they can potentially affect the development and progression of AR in long term according to TCM theory. In the present study, generally, the 6-week treatment significantly regulated some constitution. These constitutions might have long-term effects on the improvement of the symptoms that were not recorded at week 6. Our data also showed that the 1-year follow-up showed a better improvement of the symptom than the week 6 evaluation. Although the exact association of these constitutions and AR required further studies, the 1-year follow-up in this study revealed that TCM affects AR symptoms was partly mediated by the improvement of the constitutions. The TCM components and property analysis and bioinformatic analysis provide information to better understand these classical prescriptions used in this study. The four qi, five flavors, and meridian entry of the prescriptions generally reflect the therapeutic effect of the prescription in the TCM theoretical context, while the therapeutic targets, terminological enrichment, and interaction network reflect the therapeutic effect of the prescription in the modern medical context. The symptoms of AR mostly result from the over inflammatory response (Khan, 2014). At present, it is generally believed that the inflammatory response caused by the imbalance of Th1/Th2 cytokines plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AR (Chen et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2021). Our enrichment results revealed that the prescriptions involved terms related to inflammatory response and Interleukins. However, in this study, we only identified potential mechanisms but did not validate them. Further exploration of the potential mechanisms underlying the pharmacological effect of these prescriptions is still challenging and required more effort in the future. The difference in therapeutic effect on AR between SDT and ST might result from the different mechanisms of these two treatment strategies. In SDT, patients received a single prescription for the 6-week treatment, but ST received three different prescriptions, hence, the ST intervened with more targets than SDT, and might result in more therapeutic effects. In addition, SDT stimulated the same target for 6 weeks while the ST stimulated different targets for 2 weeks subsequently, thus the SDT is more likely to reach the ceiling effect of a treatment or even developed drug resistance, yet, SDT has the advantage of persistent stimulation of the targets, thus, both SDT and ST had their value in clinical TCM treatment and physicians should select SDT or ST according to the actual condition of the case. The TCM precise medicine applies customized therapeutic strategies for different patients based on their clinical characteristics and situations. The application of the TCM precise medicine improves the specificity of the treatment to the patients, avoiding side effects, off-target therapy, and overtreatment of TCM. So far, in TCM, most diseases are treated by SDT. This is one dimension of the TCM precise medication, to further develop TCM precision treatment, we need to explore more dimensions that can enable an even more precision treatment. The staging of the disease represents another dimension of TCM precise medicine and treatment based on staging provides another aspect that we can consider in TCM precise medicine. We expected that the combination of SDT and ST will be more precise than SDT and ST alone, therefore, we urge studies in the development of the combination of SDT and ST in TCM treatment. More importantly, although this study only focused on AR, the SDT and ST can be applied to the treatment of other diseases, and the therapeutic effect may depend on the disease types and the constitution of the patients, thus further investigation is needed. 5. Conclusion TMC had a desirable overall therapeutic effect on AR. For most AR patients, the syndrome differentiation based on disease alteration course over the treatment time was more therapy-critical than the syndrome differentiation based on patients' constitution (or disease subtypes) . Syndrome differentiation type and age are potential affecting factors. Declarations Availability of data and materials The data was provided in the paper and the supplementary materials.

Supplementary material 1. Theoretical basis and prescription selection 1.1. Reasons for AR 1.1.1. The evil of cold or the meridian heat in the lung results in AR. When lung qi is weak, the defense qi is too weak to protect the human body from external evils. The evil of cold or the meridian heat in the lung can cause weak lung qi and further result in a series of symptoms of AR. The AR caused by the evil of cold is called lung qi deficiency cold (LQDC) while the AR caused by the meridian heat is called lung meridian heat (LMH). 1.1.2. The weak spleen makes the dirty lung and results in AR. The spleen is the source of qi and blood and can nourish the body. A weak spleen leads to disorders in the nourishing process and further results in the dirty of the upper body and therefore blocks the function of the lung where AR occurs. This is called spleen qi deficiency weakness (SQDW). 1.1.3. Insufficient kidney power results in AR. The kidney functions for the storage and control of body fluid. The dysfunction of the kidney results in the release of body fluid which subsequently becomes nasal mucus. In addition, insufficient essence and qi in the kidney cause a vulnerable body against external evils and usually lead to a long-term AR that difficult to be cured. This is called kidney yang deficiency (KYD). 1.2. The connection of the lung, spleen, and kidney The five viscera are corresponding to five elements. The spleen corresponds to the soil, the lung corresponds to the metal, and the kidney corresponds to the water. 1.2.1. Lung and spleen The soil (spleen) produces metal (lung): the spleen is the mother of the lungs because the spleen nourishes the lungs. A weak spleen leads to a weak lung. 1.2.2. Lung and kidney Metal (lung) and water (kidney) are mutual-engendering each other. A weak kidney leads to a weak lung. 1.2.3. Spleen and kidney The kidney is the innate endowment while the spleen is the acquired intake ability. Innate endowment determines acquired intake ability while the acquired intake ability supplements the innate endowment. 1.3. Treatment of AR 1.3.1. Syndrome differentiation-based treatment (SDT): This is the conventional TCM treatment for AR. The prescriptions were selected base on the syndrome differentiation type of AR mentioned above. The prescriptions directly treated the symptom and lesions of each syndrome differentiation type. 1.3.2. Staging treatment (ST) : The prescriptions were based on the interconnection of viscera and the typical TCM pathology of AR. The lung is the major location of AR. Symptoms such as nasal congestion and runny nose are most associated with the lung. Based on a TCM principle that \"Prioritize symptoms if it is urgent and prioritize the root cause if it is chronic \", at the early stage when the symptoms are urgent, a prescription with a direct effect on the lung was applied. At the mid stage when the symptoms were improved, the root cause of the lung weakness should be addressed, thus, the tonification of the mother of the lung, th e spleen, was applied. At the late stage, in order to further strengthen the lung and enhance the tonification of the spleen for the lung, the kidney, a viscera that interacted with both the lung and spleen, was tonified. 2.
