It works by inhaling a \"super-carrier\" of oxygen produced from a derivative of pine resin. This greatly improves bioavailability of oxygen on the cellular level without hyper-oxygenation. Bol d'air increases energy and vitality, setting up a virtuous circle of improving all the body's functions. Ionic Foot Bath Turn off your phone, sit back and relax with our ionic foot bath. Using water charged with negative and positive ions, this process helps draw toxins from your body out through your feet. Experts say the detoxing process continues to alkaline the body for up to 48 hours after treatment! Jade Massage Table Come relax on our FDA-approved Medical Class II massager used to relieve pain and increase relaxation. Our table uses jade stone rollers, each heated with FIR Infrared Carbon Fiber Heating Panels. Infrared heat relieves muscular stiffness and soreness as it penetrates deep muscle tissues. Infrared Sauna Session Our infrared saunas harness what is naturally occurring with the sun using infrared waves, causing a powerful form of heat that has incredible health benefits. These infrared waves penetrate your skin, reaching muscle and other soft tissue, where it then vibrates water molecules. This vibration causes friction at a microscopic level, but you experience it as warmth enveloping your entire body. This entire process helps with detoxification, pain relief, weight loss, improved circulation, skin purification and relaxation. Chi Machine The chi machine causes gentle movement of the spine encouraging flexibility, healing to the nervous system, and provides a powerful lymphatic massage. This passive aerobic exercise increases circulation and oxygenation of the blood without any physical effort. Its fish-like movement also helps with spinal rebalancing and removes kinks and tension in the spine, back, and shoulders. Halotherapy (Dry Salt Therapy) Room Halotherapy (dry salt therapy) has been researched over the past few decades. Studies have shown it to be an alternative treatment for respiratory and skin conditions. Salt therapy can offer both respiratory (lungs and breathing) and cutaneous (skin-related) benefits. Additionally, the relaxing, calm environment offered by salt room therapy can help with stress reduction.
