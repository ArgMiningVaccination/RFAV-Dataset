After assessment, if a more serious reason for your pain isn't found, most doctors send patients to physical therapy. If the pain is still present most patients will continue on to one of the other pain management specialists. Chiropractors, physical therapists, acupuncturists, and massage therapists all overlap in their treatments. It is not uncommon for patients coming into my office to have seen all of these practitioners at some point on their journey. The bottom line is we all treat pain. We even treat pain using the same kinds of treatments. For example PTs, acupuncturists, and chiropractors will use massage therapy or cupping to relax muscles. In some states chiropractors and physical therapists perform acupuncture. Chiropractors and acupuncturists will commonly prescribe exercises for strengthening. How do you know what is the best treatment for you or which practitioner to see? First, because we all focus on pain management, I tell people to find the treatment or practitioner that resonates with them the most. There are many amazing, caring, practitioners out there. Not everybody likes PT. Not everybody likes chiropractic. Not everybody likes acupuncture. And that is okay! You want to seek care from practitioners you can communicate with, that give you a clear treatment plan, that listen and acknowledge your concerns. And obviously give you results. Second, what is your timeframe for healing? If you want to try acupuncture for pain you have to give it time to work. Plan on one month of treatment for every year of pain. For example, if you have had low back pain for 5 years, plan on 5 months of regular acupuncture treatment to reverse that. Despite this long time frame most people do see results early on. In my opinion treatments like chiropractic, physical therapy, and acupuncture need time to work. They also require a commitment on part of the patient. Thirdly, what are you willing to do at home? Are you willing to do the PT exercises given to you? Are you willing to do the stretches your chiropractor, PT, or acupuncturist recommends? You will always get better results by doing your \"homework.\" Finally, let's discuss the differences between each of these to help us understand which one would be best. In summary, Pick a practitioner you can communicate with, gives you a clear treatment plan, listens and acknowledges your concerns. And obviously give you results. Pick a treatment based on how much time you can dedicate to treatment. Are you willing to do the exercises / stretches prescribed? Pick the specialty that focuses on your problem area. To summarize: Which Practitioner is best? Doctors are for pain medication, injections, and surgery. Chiropractors align your skeleton and spine. Physical Therapists strengthen weak areas / muscles. Acupuncturists provide pain relief without medication and to reset/reactivate your nervous system. I will often see patients come to acupuncture as a last resort. They have tried all of the other treatments I have mentioned. Yes, I do help people even after they have tried all other treatments. If you want to find out if acupuncture is right for you, [schedule a free consultation](/contact). I'd love to chat with you about your specific condition. "}
