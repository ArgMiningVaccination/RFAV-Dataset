When our energetic bodies are at ease, we are at ease, we are open to healing, to peace, to love, to all of life's pleasures,\" according to the website of [Chakrubs](https://chakrubs.com/pages/about), a registered sex toy store in the United States (US) that specialises in toys made from natural crystals. While this sounds appealing, it's also up for debate; there isn't much science behind crystals, and some have argued that promoting crystal sex toys as healers is reckless because, depending on how you use them, they may cause more harm than good. For one, gemstones tend to be semi-porous which makes them difficult to clean and can cause bacteria to remain on them. If you actually insert crystals into your body, you can \"run the risk of scratching your vagina, which can also invite bacteria,\" according to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/are-yoni-eggs-safe/#:~:text=Bacterial%20and%20fungal%20infections&text=When%20you%20use%20yoni%20eggs,Kshettry%20says.), a US-based medical news website.

In particular, more people have started to be more open about self-exploration. \"Sex toy brands experienced a boom over the pandemic, as more people stayed home and needed to find ways to entertain themselves,\" according to [Sara Tang](https://www.sarasense.com/), a Hong Kong-based certified sex coach and sexologist who hosts her own podcast, Better in Bed and provides online and offline sex coaching at Asaya Wellness at The Rosewood Hotel. \"Also, I believe the younger generation, particularly Gen Z, have more sexually progressive attitudes and are more open and accepting of sex toys.\" \"There are the countless health and wellness benefits that are associated with the pleasure one gets from sex toys as well. From better sleep, relief from period pain, the balancing of hormones and boosted immunity. Sex toys make your sex life more satisfying as well. They can add novelty, excitement and new sensations to a relationship,\" Tang shares. "}
