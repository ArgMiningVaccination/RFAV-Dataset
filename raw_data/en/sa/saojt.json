Here are a few steps that may be helpful in this process: - Start with intention: Setting the intention for healing and protection is an important first step. Take a few moments to ground yourself, and focus on your intention for cleansing and protection. - Clear the energy field: Cleansing the energy field can involve a number of techniques, such as smudging with sage or palo santo, using crystals, or taking a salt bath. Choose a method that resonates with you and that you feel comfortable with, and use it to clear any stagnant or negative energy from your field. - Activate the soul energy: Activating the soul energy involves connecting with your true self and inner wisdom. This can be done through meditation, prayer, or any other practice that allows you to connect with your higher self. - Create a protective shield: Once the energy field is clear and the soul energy is activated, it's important to create a protective shield to maintain the integrity of the energy field. This can be done through visualization or intention-setting, creating a protective barrier around yourself that repels negative energy and allows positive energy to flow in. - Practice daily self-care: Maintaining a healthy and balanced energy field requires ongoing self-care. Practice daily self-care practices that support your physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual well-being, such as exercise, healthy eating, meditation, and engaging in activities that bring you joy. Remember that these practices are intended to support overall well-being and healing, and that it's important to approach them with an open mind and a willingness to learn and grow. With practice, these techniques can help activate and protect the soul energy, allowing for increased connection with the self and the universe. "}
