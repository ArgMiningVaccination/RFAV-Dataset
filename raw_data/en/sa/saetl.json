Norton, MPH, Project Manager, Complementary & Alternative Medicine Education Project, Program on Integrative Medicine, Department of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, University of North Carolina at Chapel HillIntegrating Complementary & Alternative Therapies with Conventional Care is one of a series of publications entitled The Convergence of Complementary, Alternative & Conventional Health Care , that has been developed as an educational resource for health professionals by the Program on Integrative Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. These publications respond to the many questions raised as conventional health care practi- tioners encounter widespread and increasing use of complementary and alternative therapies. The health care \"system\" today is, in fact, a dynamic, rapidly changing world of multiple healing modalities that overlap and interact on many levels. Publications in the series The Convergence of Complementary, Alterna- tive & Conventional Health Care highlight many of the key issues facing health professionals today\u2014 including assessing information, effectiveness, and integration of conventional, complementary, and alternative health care. Although the convergence of multiple health care models is not in doubt, there are many unanswered questions about how they will come to- gether. This publication explores the issues raised as conventional health care providers move toward integrated practice, and describes a variety of op- tions for doing so. The Convergence of Complementary, Alternative & Conventional Health Care was developed with sup- port from the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), National In- stitutes of Health.PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE F DEPARTMENT OF PHY SICAL MEDICINE & REHABILIT ATION F SCHOOL OF MEDICINE F UNIVERSITY OF NOR TH CAROLIN A AT CHAPEL HILL F \u00a9 2004PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE F DEPARTMENT OF PHY SICAL MEDICINE & REHABILIT ATION F SCHOOL OF MEDICINE F UNIVERSITY OF NOR TH CAROLIN A AT CHAPEL HILL F \u00a9 2004Integrating Complementary & Alternative Therapies With Conventional Care preface Thomas Edison once predicted, \"The physician of the future will give no medicine, but will interest his patients in the care of the human frame, in diet and in the cause and prevention of disease.\" While his vision has not yet materialized, recent trends in health care indicate a shift in that direction. Although it is likely that most 21st century health care providers will continue to \"give medicine\" as well as prescribe other forms of high- tech care, there are signs that these practices will more often occur in a holistic context that encourages self- care and supports self-healing and wellness. Health-care practice in the future \u2014 perhaps the very near future \u2014 could embrace and integrate a comprehensive array of therapies and healing ap- proaches, drawing on both the technological advances of contemporary medicine and the modern versions of the diverse and sometimes ancient practices and concepts of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). This potential convergence and integration of the different cultures of conventional and comple- mentary care raises many important questions for con- temporary health care providers. What is \"integrative medicine\"? And what are its implications for conven- tional health professionals in terms of quality of care, training, resources, financial dynamics and legal issues? Our purpose is to begin to answer these and other questions and in so doing, to provide encour- agement and support to those practitioners now ex-CONTENTS CAM Use in the United States ................................................... 2 Integrative Medicine: Definitions and Methodologies ................. 5 Moving Towards Integrative Health Care: Benefits and Challenges ........................................................ 5 Case 1: Adult Outpatient Oncology Consult ............................... 6 Case 2: Pediatric Inpatient Consult .......................................... 7 The Challenge of Change ....................................................... 10 System Resistance ............................................................. 11 Educational Needs ............................................................. 12 Financial Disincentives ........................................................ 13 Approaches to Integrative Health Care ..................................... 15 Model 1: The Informed Clinician ........................................... 16 Model 2: The Informed, Networking Clinician ......................... 18 Model 3: The Informed, CAM-Trained Clinician ....................... 19 Model 4: Multidisciplinary Integrative Group 20 Model 5: Interdisciplinary Practice ............... 6: Hospital-Based Integration .................................... 23 Model 7: Integrative Medicine in an Academic Medical Center .................................................. 24 Steps Towards Integrating CAM with Conventional Practice .......... 25 Conclusion ........................................................................... 28 References .......................................................................... 29 Appendix .............................................................................

Specifically, we hope to assist readers to: Understand the factors supporting the integration of complementary and alternative practices with conventional health care; Appreciate the potential benefits of an integrative approach to care; Understand the factors that present barriers to change and limit options for integrat- ing care; Become aware of different contemporary forms of integrative care; Learn about steps towards integrative care for the individual practitioner. In the final analysis, the path to new, integrated models of care will be shaped through a partnership effort between health care practitioners and their patients as well as through the evolv- ing forces within the current medical system and society itself. If all comers contribute with confidence, openness, and a spirit of seeking the best of health care, improved health care services should follow. A note about the terminology used here. In recent years, the term \"CAM\" has come into common usage to describe, in the words of the National Center for Complementary and Alterna- tive Medicine, \" a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not presently considered to be part of conventional medicine .\" These therapies include highly specialized methods such as biofeedback, millennia-old practices such as meditation, and comprehensive traditional healing systems such as Traditional Chinese Medicine. They encompass a wide variety of skills and train- ing, with varying certification and licensure requirements. Despite its convenient brevity, the acronym CAM has some unfortunate implications. It suggests, for example, a homogeneity among the practices included under the umbrella term\u2014 something that is not at all true. It also implies a clear and complete distinction between conven- tional and CAM systems of care. That also is inaccurate. We therefore use the term CAM sparingly, as shorthand for that \"group of diverse medical and health care systems . . .\" where the emphasis is on the word \"diverse.\" Douglas Mann Susan Gaylord Sally No rtonINTEGRA TING COMPLEMENT ARY & ALTERN ATIVE THERAPIES WITH CONVENTION AL CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE F DEPARTMENT OF PHY SICAL MEDICINE & REHABILIT ATION F SCHOOL OF MEDICINE F UNIVERSITY OF NOR TH CAROLIN A AT CHAPEL HILL F \u00a9 20041 Integrating Complementary & Alternative Therapies With Conventional Care \"The public is using alternative therapies on a broad basis. To best serve them, health care professionals must learn the good and bad points of these therapies. Enlightened professionals will work with informed patients to integrate the most useful and proven therapies into their standard practice. In such a setting, patient satisfaction is bound to increase. By applying scientific rigor in evaluating the alternative therapies, we will protect our patients while offering them the best of care: the integrative care mode.\" \u2014Victor S. Sierpina, MD Mainstream medicine is changing. The biomedical conceptual framework that evolved and ultimately defined the American health-care system in the 20th century continues to pre- dominate. However, there is evidence that other therapeutic modalities, with different conceptual frameworks, are beginning to compete with this dominant model ( Eisenberg, et al., 1993 ; Eisenberg, et al., 1998; Eisenberg, et al., 2001). A number of trends suggest that conventional medicine may yield in the 21st century to an in- creasingly pluralistic health-care system, in which different models of care may co-exist (Barrett, 2003). However, the mere coexistence of different healing mo- dalities does not produce an integrative system of care. Indeed, within the current health care system, patients and providers expe- rience problems when multiple\u2014but uncoordinated\u2014healing ap- proaches are used (Markman, 2002). A commonly cited example is the potential for adverse herb-drug interactions that may occur as patients mix herbal and pharmaceutical treatments without the awareness or guidance of health care providers (Ang-Lee, Moss, & Wuan, 2001; Piscitelli, 2000; Piscitelli, Burstein, & Chaitt, 2002). Other problems include poor communication between providers and patients, issues about credentials, training, and licensure of providers and excessive costs of multiple, uncoordinated treatments (Cohen & Eisenberg, 2002).THE FUTURE OF CAM IN WESTERN MEDICINE A recent trend analysis provides the following forecast for the future of CAM: \"CAM therapies will become major tools for health promotion and disease prevention; \"CAM will be integrated into conventional medical protocols; \"Some CAM providers will become recognized as pri- mary care providers; \"Conventional . . . providers will increase the use of alternative therapies; \"Providers that take a role in creating healthy com- munities will gain a competitive edge.\" (Bezold, 2001)THE CONVER GENCE OF COMPLEMENT ARY, ALTERN ATIVE CONVENTION AL HEAL TH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE F DEPARTMENT OF PHY SICAL MEDICINE & REHABILIT ATION F SCHOOL OF MEDICINE F UNIVERSITY OF NOR TH CAROLIN A AT CHAPEL HILL F \u00a9 20042 Increasingly, the term \"integrated\" or \"inte- grative\" describes medical practices that, while retain- ing many of the characteristics and strengths of bio- medicine, also embrace the more holistic concepts and methods of complementary and alternative practices (Rakel & Weil, 2003). A \"healthy,\" effective system of integrative care will require a conscious, thoughtful approach to combining different healing modalities. Just what new models of care will emerge and how quickly they will evolve is unclear (Barrett, 2003). CAM use in the united states A major trend over the last four decades has been the steady increase in U.S. consumers' use of com- plementary and alternative therapies, including acupunc- ture, chiropractic, energy healing, herbal medicine, ho- meopathy, and massage (Eisenberg, et al., 1993; Eisenberg, et al., 1998; Druss & Rosenheck, 1999; Barnes, et al., 2004). This trend is likely to continue (Kessler, et al., 2001). From 1990 to 1997, annual visits to alternative practitioners grew from 470 million to 629 million (Eisenberg, et al., 1998). Those estimated 629 million visits to complementary care providers far exceeded the 386 million visits made to all U.S. pri- mary-care physicians that year, and out-of-pocket ex- penditures for CAM therapies were an estimated $27 billion, comparable to those of all U.S. primary care providers. Significantly, complementary and alternative modalities are often used in addition to, and not as replacements for, conventional care (Eisenberg, et al., 1993; Eisenberg, et al., 1998). One can argue that the impetus for new, integrated models of care comes from consumers themselves, who are using both forms of care, often for the same condition (Singer, 2001). One national survey of the use of CAM (Eisenberg, et al., 1998) found that the highest use was for back problems, allergies, fatigue, and arthritis; other conditions included headaches, neck problems, hypertension, sprains or muscle strains, insomnia, pulmonary problems, dermato- logical disorders, digestive disorders, depression and anxiety ( see Table 1 on page 3 ). Another survey found frequent CAM use for psychological problems, pain, back problems, musculoskeletal disor- ders, chronic illness, anxiety, headaches, and smoking cessation (Astin, 1998). According to the Eisenberg, et al., (1998) survey, the most frequently used therapies were relaxation techniques (16 percent), herbal medicine (12 percent), massage (11 percent), and chiro-\"COMPLEMENT ARY\" AND \"ALTERNA TIVE\" - DEFINING TERMS In 1991, the Office of Alternative Therapies of the National Institutes of Health was created to investigate the increasing use of alternative therapies in the U.S. In 1997, this office was designated a Center, with an enlarged research budget. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medi- cine (NCCAM) defines \"CAM\" as \"a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not presently considered to be part of conventional medicine.\" These range from highly specialized methods (e.g., biofeedback) and ancient practices (e.g., meditation); to comprehensive traditional healing systems (e.g., Ayurveda). NCCAM categorizes these widely varied alternative thera- peutic modalities into five broad areas: Alternative medical systems (Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ayurveda, homeopathy, naturopathy) Mind-body interventions (biofeedback, hypnosis, mindfulness meditation, yoga, guided imagery) Biologically based therapies (diet, supplements, herbals, vita- mins, detoxification, elimination) Manipulation and body-based methods (massage, chiroprac- tic, osteopathy, Feldenkrais, Alexander Technique) Energy therapies (acupuncture, Reiki, magnets, therapeutic touch) While somewhat arbitrary, these categories provide a structure for considering the scope and methods of alternative and comple- mentary approaches. Some therapies fit into more than one cat- egory.

Less commonly used were folk remedies, energy healing, homeopathy, hypno- sis, biofeedback and acupuncture. This survey also found that CAM use was higher among women (49 percent) than men (38 percent); less common among African Americans (33 percent) than other racial groups (45 percent); and highest among the 35-49 year age group (50 percent) com- pared with older (39 percent) or younger (42 percent) age groups. Greater use was reported among those with college educations (51 percent) than with no college education (36 percent); and with annual incomes above $50,000 (48 percent) than with lower incomes (42 percent). consumer rationale for CAM use The growing numbers of CAM users tell only part of the story of change in the health care system. Consumers' motives for seeking alternative care reveal a great deal about why the numbers are growing and suggest the consumer priorities that are likely to influence the shape of future health care models. Many cultural and individual factors influence choice of health care services, including gender, age, geography, education, and race (Bair, et al., 2002). Also important are the health conditions for which consumers seek care. Research indicates that those suffering from chronic, non-life-threatening health problems tend to be the heaviest users of CAM (Bausell, Lee, & Berman, TABLE 1 USE OF CAM FOR PRINCIP AL MEDICAL CONDITIONS B Y US ADUL TS, 1997 PERCENT PERCENT WHO SAW PERCENT PERCENT WHO SAW MD AND WHO SAW WHO USED CAM PROVIDER USED CAM MD AND PERCENT CAM FOR FOR THERAPY FOR CAM PROVIDER WHO CONDITION CONDITION CONDITION FOR CONDITION MOST COMMONLY REPORTED IN PAST 12 IN PAST 12 IN PAST 12 IN PAST 12 USED THERAPIES CONDITION CONDITION MONTHS* MONTHS MONTHS* MONTHS FOR THE CONDITION Back Problems 24.0 47.6 30.1 58.8 39.1 Chiropractic; massage Allergies 20.7 16.6 4.2 28.0 6.4 Herbal; relaxation Fatigue 16.7 27.9 6.3 51.6 13.1 Relaxation; massage Arthritis 16.6 26.7 10.0 38.5 15.9 Relaxation; chiropractic Headaches 12.9 32.2 13.3 42.0 20.0 Relaxation; chiropractic Neck Problems 12.1 57.0 37.5 66.6 47.5 Chiropractic; massage High Blood Pressure 10.9 11.7 0.9 11.9 1.1 Megavitamins; relaxation Sprains or Strains 10.8 23.6 10.3 29.4 15.9 Chiropractic; relaxation Insomnia 9.3 26.4 7.6 48.4 13.3 Relaxation; herbal Lung Problems 8.7 13.2 2.5 17.6 3.4 Relaxation; spiritual healing; herbal Skin Problems 8.6 6.7 2.2 6.8 0.0 Imagery; energy healing Digestive Problems 8.2 27.3 9.7 34.1 10.7 Relaxation; herbal Severe Depression 5.6 40.9 15.6 40.9 26.9 Relaxation; spiritual healing Anxiety Attacks 5.5 42.7 11.6 42.7 21.0 Relaxation; spiritual healing WEIGHTED AVERAGE 28.2 11.4 31.8 13.7 (adapted from Eisenberg et al., 1998 ) *includes provider and self-treatmentTHE CONVER GENCE OF COMPLEMENT ARY, ALTERN ATIVE & CONVENTION AL HEAL TH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE F DEPARTMENT OF PHY SICAL MEDICINE & REHABILIT ATION F SCHOOL OF MEDICINE F UNIVERSITY OF NOR TH CAROLIN A AT CHAPEL HILL F \u00a9 20044 2001). Many reports conclude that the majority of CAM users employ CAM as an adjunct to mainstream medi- cine for prevention rather than treatment of illness (Druss & Rosenheck, 1999; Ernst, 2001). Additionally, research investigating the motives of CAM users suggests that, while many consumers still value and rely on conventional care, they also appreciate many of the characteristics and qualities of CAM care that are not typically found in mainstream medicine\u2014 including a holistic approach to healing, personal atten- tion, cultural sensitivity, lower cost, and fewer negative side effects (Astin, 1998). These characteristics or \"prin- ciples\" include beliefs and practices shared by many complementary and alternative modalities ( see box, left ). provider rationale for cam use Like their patients, mainstream health care prac- titioners are exploring non-conventional health and heal- ing options in greater numbers. A primary motivation is desire to communicate more effectively and be more knowledgeable in interactions with their patients who are coming to them with questions about complementary and alternative therapies. A second motivation is perceived limitations of conventional health care (Starfield, 2000; Astin, Ariane, Pelletier, Jarjouja, Polen, & Rutecki, 1999). Some cite dissatisfaction with the fast pace and pharmaceutical fo- cus of conventional care as a reason for exploring CAM. The dramatic statistics on medical errors and pharma- ceutical risks have alerted providers to the need for con- cern about the safety of conventional medical practices (Lazarou, Pomeranz, & Corey, 1998). Deaths from medi- cal errors in 1997 exceeded those from motor vehicle ac- cidents, breast cancer, AIDS, or workplace injuries (Insti- tute of Medicine, 1999). Another strong motivator is the search for effec- tive treatments for diseases that do not respond well to conventional care. For example, a growing list of sys- temic disorders (such as fibromyalgia) and lifestyle-related health problems frequently fail to respond to the treat- ment approaches of conventional medical practice (Yunus, Bennett, Romano, et al., 1997; DeBacquer, et al., 2004).PRINCIPLES OF HEALING EMPHASIZED IN MANY COMPLEMENT ARY AND ALTERNA TIVE THERAPIES While a disparate array of alternative therapies and healing sys- tems fall under the umbrella term \"CAM,\" what they typically have in common are fundamental principles of health and heal- ing. These principles are not unique to CAM (conventional medi- cine subscribes to some), nor do all CAM therapies embrace them equally. Taken together, however, they provide a framework for understanding CAM approaches to healing that contrast with the biomedical model of care. Many CAM therapeutic systems em- phasize some or all of the following principles to a greater degree than conventional medicine. Effective integration of CAM and conventional care must rest on acknowledgment, appreciation, and application of these principles in a patient-centered context. PROMOTE THE BODY 'S SELF -HEALING ABILITIES (This is perhaps the most important principle, influencing all others.) EMPHASIZE EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PATIENT AND HEALER , which builds trust and promotes integration. EMPHASIZE SELF -CARE and empowerment of the patient in the healing process. RECOGNIZE MIND , BODY , AND SPIRIT as interactive and insepa- rable. ADDRESS UNDERLYING CAUSES OF ILLNESS \u2014-including emotional, environmental, and spiritual factors\u2014rather than just its clinical manifestations. PREVENT ILL HEALTH by remaining in balance and harmony with the psychosocial and physical environment. ENHANCE WELLNESS with optimal diet, exercise, and a reduced- stress lifestyle. INDIVIDUALIZE TREATMENT to the particular patient, rather than focusing on the disease condition. EMPHASIZE THE USE OF NATURAL NON-PHARMACEUTICAL SUBSTANCES or non-surgical techniques in the care of the patient. APPRECIATE THE ELECTROMAGNETIC AND ENERGETIC NATURE OF THE HU- MAN ORGANISM and the importance of vitality in healing. APPRECIATE THE IMPORTANCE OF INTUITIVE AWARENESS and the individual's unique experiences in determining pathways to healing. ACKNOWLEDGE THE HEALING JOURNEY and that the return to whole- ness can be a gentle and gradual, developmental process .

The increased interest in preventive approaches is also a compelling rationale for attraction to CAM therapies (Ernst, 2001). Whatever the motivation, increasing numbers of conventional clinicians are learning about and exploring CAM therapies for personal and professional use. Some of them are contemplating or actively integrating complementary and conventional methods, in both small and more compre- hensive ways (Barnes , Barrett, 2003; Veenstra, 2000; Moore, 1997). Health insurers and managed care organizations that have incorporated CAM into their policies state that their primary motivation is market demand. Therapies such as nutritional coun- seling, biofeedback, acupuncture, preventive medicine, and chiropractic are increasingly covered under many health plans (Pelletier, Astin, & Haskell, 1999). integrative medicine: definitions and methodologies As the name attests, \"integrative medicine\" brings together diagnostic and healing methods from mainstream medicine and alternative healing systems. Ideally, integrative medicine draws on the formidable strengths of biomedicine and benefits of holistic and natural healing modalities in an individualized, patient-centered approach that seeks to enhance and utilize self-healing capacity (Bell, et al., 2002). The vision for integrative medicine is under debate. Of particular concern is the possibil- ity that integrative medicine will be perceived\u2014and therefore practiced\u2014as \"combination medi- cine.\" Adding alternative therapies to a practice grounded in conventional medical beliefs may appear to be \"integrative\" and may be a critical first step towards integration, but it is not \"integrative medicine.\" \"Integrative medi- cine\" must be defined by a new philosophical context that embraces healing the whole person and utilizing principles commonly empha- sized in CAM ( see box, page 4 ). Examples of concepts fundamental to integrative health care planning include: detoxifying the physical, so- cial, and psychological environment; nourishing and supporting the body, mind, and spirit; and stimulating the patient's self-healing abili- ties. The cases on pages 6 and 7 provide examples of the application of these principles in an integrative medicine consult service. moving towards integrative health care: benefits & challenges The integration of CAM practices, therapies, and beliefs with con- ventional health-care practices offers considerable potential for an improved health care system, such as expanded treatment options, improved patient and provider satisfaction, and improved therapeu-WHA T IS INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE? According to the National Institutes of Health, Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), \"integration combines mainstream medical therapies and CAM therapies for which there is some high-quality scientific evidence of safety and effectiveness.\" (www.nccam.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/#3) Prac- tically speaking, integrative medicine involves the ap- plication of medical diagnostic and therapeutic tech- niques from both conventional and alternative tradi- tions. However, It is not merely the addition of non- conventional therapies and techniques to conventional practice. A new model of healing is called for\u2014one that goes beyond treatment of disease to embrace a holistic approach to health and healing (as addressed by Snyderman & Weil (2002) and many others).THE CONVER GENCE OF COMPLEMENT ARY, ALTERN ATIVE & CONVENTION AL HEAL TH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE F DEPARTMENT OF PHY SICAL MEDICINE & REHABILIT ATION F SCHOOL OF MEDICINE F UNIVERSITY OF NOR TH CAROLIN A AT CHAPEL HILL F \u00a9 20046 tic outcomes (White & Ernst, 2000). With these ben- efits, there are also many challenges. If conventional and non-conventional prac- tices are to come together successfully, practitioners will confront a number of important issues, including differences in practice cul- tures, credentials and train- ing, quality assurance, fund- ing and research. In addition to en- hancing the strengths of con- ventional medicine, integra- tive care may be able to bet- ter balance its deficiencies (Caspi, et al., 2003). These include potential negative side effects of individual pharmacological agents and polypharmacy, high costs and depersonalizing nature of technological interven- tions, and suppression of symptoms without promot- ing overall healing. infusion of a fresh perspective on healing The goal of med- icine is not merely to treat disease, but to relieve suffer- ing, and suffering is experi- enced not only at a biologi- cal level but by the complex social and psychological entity that is the human being. The intense pace of modern medicine sometimes overlooks the needs of the whole person, resulting in medical intervention that, though technically adequate, fails to meet these needs (Cassell, 1982). As the principles of CAM merge with conventional care, they could infuse the practice of medicine with the bio-psycho-socio- spiritual goal of healing the whole person.CASE 1: ADUL T OUTP ATIENT ONCOLOG Y THE PROBLEM: A UNC oncologist referred a 56-year-old white male with a recent diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma to the UNC Integrative Medicine (IM) Consult Team. This patient, Mr. J, was experiencing ab- dominal pain, weight loss, and diarrhea. A 4-cm mass had been found in the head of the pancreas, with three small metastatic lesions in the liver. He had been given a grave prognosis at another institution, and was justifiably anxious. Mr. J was seeking support and guidance for exploring complementary treatment options. He was particularly interested in nutritional therapies. PRE-EXISTING TREATMENTS: Mr. J had been on a regimen of chemotherapy for a week and continued a course of standard oncology care thereafter. IM TEAM INVESTIGATION: Initially, the IM Consult Team, consisting of a neurologist, pharmacist, and psychologist, met with Mr. J and discussed some complementary options in the areas of mind-body thera- pies, nutrition, body-work and energetic therapies, mindful exercise, social support, and spiritual perspec- tives. Mr. J struggled with conflicting beliefs about his potential for survival based on pessimistic comments from his former oncologist, on data on median survival time of people with his diagnosis, and awareness of other patients who had survived this condition in spite of very similar lesions. IM TEAM RECOMMENDATION: The IM Team recommended dietary modifications such as: to eliminate high glycemic index foods, caffeine, red meats, and fatty foods; and to increase water intake. They also recommended a number of supplements as follows: vitamins\u2014C, B- complex, B-12, E, D, A, acid; selenium, calcium, and pectin, oil, and pan- creatic enzymes. The herb milk thistle also was recommended. Mr. J was encouraged to maintain his support network, which included members of his church\u2014a central feature of his life. An array of mind- body skills were offered to Mr. J as well. OUTCOMES: Mr. J complained about the extreme change in diet, yet he readily complied. The Team worked with him using hypnosis and guided imagery, to gain insight about his beliefs and to modify them. Training to optimize heart-rate variability was helpful in recognizing and maintaining the still point in the present moment, where calm and insight could easily occur. Mr. J participated in regular meetings with the IM Team for 15 months. At this time, Mr. J is still working regularly, with stable weight and stable primary tumor size, good energy, sleep, and appetite. He remains uncertain about the course of his illness, but admits that his survival is impressive. LESSONS: A key concern of Mr. J was the lack of communication and difference in perspectives between the Consult Team and his conventional oncologist. A turning point in care for all was a meeting with Mr. J, a family member, and all of his caregivers to discuss his progress and to develop a comprehensive plan. This meeting represented, for him, truly integrative care.INTEGRA TING COMPLEMENT ARY & ALTERN ATIVE THERAPIES WITH CONVENTION AL CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE F DEPARTMENT OF PHY SICAL MEDICINE & REHABILIT ATION F SCHOOL OF MEDICINE F UNIVERSITY OF NOR TH CAROLIN A AT CHAPEL HILL F \u00a9 20047 expanded options for patient care By its nature, an integrative clinical practice provides an expanded array of health-care options. While conventional therapies such as prescription drugs may effectively address a particu- lar condition, not every individual will respond well to a given protocol. For instance, use of the triptans has revolutionized the acute treatment of migraine. However, over 25 percent of patients CASE 2: PEDIA TRIC INP ATIENT CONSUL T THE PROBLEM: The UNC Integrative Medicine Consult Team was contacted by hospital staff due to a conflict between attending physicians and the parents of a 13-year-old female with extensive inflammatory bowel disease who was experiencing continued weight loss and bleeding into the bowel. The attending physicians and house staff reported that the patient had recently relapsed while under their care after initially doing better. The attending physicians believed that the deterioration was related to the use of non-conventional substances administered to the patient by her parents. The house staff indicated that the conflict was generating stress in the patient and believed that the stress was contributing to the deterioration. THE TREATMENTS: The parents had been giving the patient a powdered mixture containing licorice, germanium, comfrey, fish oil, lactobacillus, calcium, iron and an unknown herb. The patient had been successfully treated 18 months earlier for this same condition by a naturopathic physician using this remedy, and perhaps others. Following this treatment, which took place in another state prior to the patient's family moving to North Carolina, the patient had remained symptom-free until eight weeks prior to this admission, when she again began experiencing bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss. The attending physicians had pursued a course of treatment that consisted of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) TEAM INVESTIGATION: The IM Consult Team, consisting of a physician, psychologist, and pharmacist, met separately with the physicians and house staff, and with the parents. The team's appreciation of CAM therapies helped gain the family's trust and participation in resolving the conflict. The team undertook a literature search to determine possible side effects and interactions of the treatment protocols. Comfrey and germanium were discovered to be potentially toxic to the liver and capable of interfering with clotting. The team further determined that Cipro was probably unnecessary. IM TEAM RECOMMENDATION: The IM Consult Team recommended to the parents that they follow the advice of putting the bowel at rest, and limiting the administration of any oral substances. The Team also recommended the use of self-hypnosis, guided imagery, and biofeedback. Although the parents were not convinced that the naturopathic treatment was responsible for the bleeding, they and the attending physicians agreed that putting the bowel at rest along with other complementary approaches would be worth a try. A plan was developed that consisted of restricted oral intake, a very few oral medications, and a self-hypnosis routine including guided imagery addressing pain control and healing of the bowel. OUTCOMES: The family participated in the self-hypnosis instruction and practiced it with the patient. The patient also was trained in heart rate variability control. Because her sympathetic nervous system was very active, she was taught a routine for balancing the sympathetic and parasym- pathetic systems. The approach, in effect empowered the patient to de-stress (CAM principle of self-care and empowerment). By the end of the first week, the patient experienced a marked reduction in pain and bleeding. At the end of the second week, she tolerated the re-introduction of food. Patient, family and staff satisfaction with the care improved dramatically, as did communication between family and hospital staff. LESSONS: Upon discharge, the patient was pleased with self-hypnosis and considering biofeedback. The family agreed to consultation with a local naturopathic physician to oversee use of herbs, probiotics, and dietary management. Integration of conventional and complementary therapies was achieved. Application of mind-body therapies was an effective component of the treatment program. Both the conventional providers and family members gained new awareness and insights for the management of this condition.THE CONVER GENCE OF COMPLEMENT ARY, ALTERN ATIVE & CONVENTION AL HEAL TH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE F DEPARTMENT OF PHY SICAL MEDICINE & REHABILIT ATION F SCHOOL OF MEDICINE F UNIVERSITY OF NOR TH CAROLIN A AT CHAPEL HILL F \u00a9 20048 do not respond at all to triptans, and in those who do, effective treatment occurs in only 75 percent of headaches (Matchar, 2003). Incorporating complementary therapies for acute headache\u2014such as self-hypnosis, aromatherapy, and acupressure\u2014provides patients with effective options that lead to pain control and lower cost (Holroyd & Mauskop, 2003). Other examples include: Blood pressure management through a combination of hypnosis, diet modifications, and medication (Kirsch, Montgomery, & Saperstein, 1995); Migraine reduction by combined use feverfew and a beta blocker; (Holroyd & Mauskop, 2003); Marlow Kreuter, 2003); Low-back pain management with opiates and acupuncture (Grant, Bishop-Miller, Winchester, Anderson, & Faulkner, 1999). enhanced patient and provider satisfaction CAM practices, while varied, tend to share a holistic approach to healing, one that empha- sizes an individualized approach to diagnosis and treatment. While many good health practitioners spend ample time with patients and provide a multifactorial assessment, it is often the disease, rather than the person, that guides the approach to treatment. Anecdotal evidence suggests that many CAM and integrative-care providers spend more time getting to know the patients' individual needs and desires, providing a patient-centered approach to diagnosis and treatment that may im- prove both patient and caregiver satisfaction (Snyderman & Weil, 2002). Integration can improve a patient's personal decision-making and enhance physical and emotional well being by improving communication with all providers and by increasing their knowl- edge of health-promoting practices (Furnham, 1996). Furthermore, integration of complementary treatments such as mind-body therapies may increase patients' conscious participation in the heal- ing process and feelings of empowerment. Health-care providers may experience greater satisfaction through learning about new treatment strategies and developing skill in implementing them. For example, a randomized trial training generalist physicians to give manual therapy for acute low-back pain produced moderate benefit for patients; the most substantial finding was the increased self-efficacy and satisfaction of the doctors in managing low-back pain (Curtis, Evans, Rowane, Carey, & Jackman, 1997). decreased dependency on medication Increased use\u2014and misuse\u2014of pharmaceuticals provides motivation for integrating CAM and conventional medicine. The conventional clinician-patient dyad is often content to passively employ multiple medications in the name of symptom reduction, efficiency, and convenience. With the proliferation of medical specialties, each with its own cadre of medicines, polypharmacy and adverse drug interactions have become the rule rather than the exception, particularly for the eld-INTEGRA TING COMPLEMENT ARY & ALTERN ATIVE THERAPIES WITH CONVENTION AL CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE F DEPARTMENT OF PHY SICAL MEDICINE & REHABILIT ATION F SCHOOL OF MEDICINE F UNIVERSITY OF NOR TH CAROLIN A AT CHAPEL HILL F \u00a9 20049 erly and those with chronic illnesses 1999; Bretherton, Day, & Lewis, 2003; Colley & Lucas, Substituting non-phar- macologic therapies may reduce potential iatro- genic effects of multiple medications, including the potential for drug dependency and negative side effects, and could lower costs while main- taining positive health outcomes. For example, in a comparison outcome study of patients with major depression who underwent an aerobic ex- ercise regimen, treatment with sertraline, or a combination of exercise and sertraline, all three groups showed equivalent improvement after four months. Interestingly, those who exercised showed a marked reduction in relapse rate, com- pared with the sertraline-alone group (Babyak, et al., 2000). enhanced health-care outcomes There is evidence that a combination of conventional and complementary treatments often produces better outcomes than conven- tional therapies alone, particularly when \"out- comes\" include reduction of negative side ef- fects of treatment. The synergy of integrative care in many clinical situations offers a variety of benefits, including accelerated recovery from surgery, decreased reliance on medications, and reduction of side effects (Enqvist & Fischer, 1997; Somri, et al., 2001). Another study (Davidson, Abraham, Connor, & McLoed, 2003) demonstrated marked improvement of features of atypical depression by the addition of chro- mium to standard treatment. In addition, a study by Shults, et al. (2002) found significantly slower progression of Parkinson's disease with the ad- dition of coenzyme Q10 to existing treatment regimens in a dose-dependent fashion. CAM therapies can provide healing options when conventional treatment has failed or is not available. For example, it is difficult to treat tardive dyskinesia (TD), and there are few treatment options. However, use of vitamin E in moderate to high doses protects against deterioration in TD patients (Soares & McGrath, 2001).ORGANIZA TIONS SUPPORTING INTEGRA TIVE HEAL TH CARE Organizations providing education or support and certification for integrative medicine skills American Academy of Environmental Medicine: www.aaem.com, 7701 East Kellogg, Suite 625, Wichita, KS 684-5500 American Academy of Medical Acupuncture: www.medicalacupuncture.org, 4929 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 428, Los Angeles, CA (323) 937-5514 American Association of 992-2063, Fax (719) in therapy): 23121 Verdugo Drive, Suite 204, Laguna 532-3688 American College of Preventive Medicine: www.acpm.org, 1307 New York Avenue, NW, Suite 200, Washington, DC 20005, Tel (202) 466-2044, Fax (202) 466-2662 American Holistic Medical Association: www.holisticmedicine.org, 12101 Boulevard, NE, Suite C, Albuquerque, Ave., Arbor MI 48104, Tel (734) 662-9355, Fax (734) 662-1727 Foundation for the Advancement of Innovative Medicine: http:// www.faim.org/, Two Executive Blvd; Suite 206; Suffern, NY 10901, (877) 634 3246 (toll International Medical and Dental Hypnotherapy Association: www.infinityinst.com/imdha.html, 4110 Edgeland, Suite 800, Royal Oak, MI 549-5594 International Society for Orthomolecular Toronto, (416) 733-2117, 733-2352THE CONVER GENCE OF COMPLEMENT ARY, ALTERN ATIVE & CONVENTION AL HEAL TH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE F DEPARTMENT OF PHY SICAL MEDICINE & REHABILIT ATION F SCHOOL OF MEDICINE F UNIVERSITY OF NOR TH CAROLIN A AT CHAPEL HILL F \u00a9 200410 added emphasis on disease prevention and wellness In medical school training, there is relatively little emphasis on preventive care, compared to disease management (Garr, Lackland, & Wilson, 2000). At the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, for instance, only 3 of 29 courses in the first two years have segments specifi- cally devoted to issues of prevention. Many complementary therapies may be usefully applied in primary prevention as well as integrated in secondary and tertiary efforts. Examples include dietary management, exercise, stress reduction, biofeedback, and the use of supplements. Some specialty treatment guidelines now include complementary therapies as part of recommended treatment paths, such as the American Headache Society's recommendation for use of magnesium and ribo- flavin supplements for the prevention of migraine, which is based on the highest quality clinical study of magnesium and migraine (Peikert, Wilimzig, & Kohne-Volland, 1996). the challenge of change Despite considerable interest on the part of the health-care consumer and many practitioners, CAM integration with mainstream medicine is occurring relatively slowly (Kessler, et al., 2001). Reasons include simple inertia, financial disincentives, differences in beliefs about healing, lack of access to education about CAM, and limited information on clinical outcomes about complemen- tary and alternative therapies (Faass, 2001). These are not small barriers to change, nor will the momentum of consumer and practitioner interest be sufficient to create an integrative model of care. Until these issues are addressed successfully, conventional and CAM modalities will most likely continue their largely independent coexistence, with the atttendant problems. The challenge to health care practitioners is to understand and address the key issues that are raised as conven- tional, complementary, and alternative healing systems interact and perhaps converge. consumer-driven health care For the conventional practitioner, the most compelling factor in the movement toward integrative health care is the growing use of complementary and alternative medicine by their patients (Kessler, et al., 2001). Although there are positive aspects of patient-driven health care, there are also downsides: as patients reach out for information and guidance from multiple sources\u2014 many of which are incomplete or ill informed\u2014they risk making choices that may be dangerous, inefficient, or unnecessary. Since the vast majority of patients who use CAM also use conventional care, it becomes the responsibility of the conventional provider to become at least minimally knowledgeable about CAM. Although most pa- tients do not discuss CAM with their conventional providers, others seek validation or clarity about CAM therapies, or request referrals to alternative caregivers, requiring even further expertise. In the age of information \"overload,\" keeping abreast of advances in one's own profession is a daunting task for all care pro- viders. Becoming well-informed and staying current about a wideFACTORS SUPPORTING INTEGRA TIVE HEAL TH CARE Patient use of and desire for CAM and IM Expanding choices of CAM therapeutic mo- dalities in the U.S. Health professionals' increased awareness of, interest in, and education about CAM and IM Increased communication among conven- tional and CAM providers Documentation of success of integrative prac- ticesINTEGRA TING COMPLEMENT ARY & ALTERN ATIVE THERAPIES WITH CONVENTION AL CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE F DEPARTMENT OF PHY SICAL MEDICINE & REHABILIT ATION F SCHOOL OF MEDICINE F UNIVERSITY OF NOR TH CAROLIN A AT CHAPEL HILL F \u00a9 200411 array of healing modalities outside one's specialty may seem impos- sible. Yet, in the name of professionalism, one needs to be able to respond to patient questions about alternative therapies, to under- stand that a much wider range of options is now available, and to be aware of the risks, benefits, and costs of these options. system resistance usual and customary care Perhaps no greater barrier exists to change than the \"status quo.\" There is a general perception in Western culture that conven- tional medicine is a known entity, imbued with good intentions and excellent methods. It is perceived by some as a comfortable, work- able, and profitable system that answers the health care needs of most people most of the time, despite significant treatment side ef- fects and interactions, sub-optimal evidence of effectiveness, and accelerating (Beyth and Shorr, 1999; Bretherton, et al., 2003; 1993 Poynard, et al., 2002; Starfield, 2000). In particular, \"usual and customary care\" may be used by the insurance and pharmaceutical indus- tries to place economic barriers that impede change and use of alternatives. Integrating CAM into this system is therefore difficult and, in some instances, integration of specific complementary therapies requires greater evidence of efficacy and safety than required of conventional treatments (Bower, 1998). institutional competition In addition, the \"status quo\" is more than the practice habits of health care providers. It embraces all the social, political, and economic institutions, policies, and laws that make up the conventional health care system. Legal statutes, regulations, curricular policy, and professional cul- ture all have a significant effect on the practitioner's ability to provide integrated services. The market economy of health care, including reliance on expensive procedures and short office visits, combined with the powerful influence of the pharmaceutical industry on the health-care prescrib- ing habits of physicians, is a tremendous deterrent to institutional change (Relman & Angell, 2002). a clash of clinical \"cultures\" The lack of a common conceptual framework and corresponding clinical vocabulary can significantly impede integration by making communication challenging among different health- care cultures. For example, the term \"chi\" is meaningful in the practice of acupuncture but has no direct functional counterpart in the vocabulary or belief system of western medicine. Likewise, the phrase \"magnetic resonance spectroscopy\" may mean very little to a practitioner of Ayurvedic medicine.FACTORS IMPEDING INTEGRA TION Inertia of the status quo Differences in clinical vocabularies and ide- ologies Boundary issues among CAM and conven- tional providers Lack of health-care provider motivation and educational opportunities Perceived lack of CAM research validation Financial disincentives Lack of certification and licensure of CAM pro- viders and fear of legal riskTHE CONVER GENCE OF COMPLEMENT ARY, ALTERN ATIVE & CONVENTION AL HEAL TH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE F DEPARTMENT OF PHY SICAL MEDICINE & REHABILIT ATION F SCHOOL OF MEDICINE F UNIVERSITY OF NOR TH CAROLIN A AT CHAPEL HILL F \u00a9 200412 educational needs pre-doctoral education There is widespread agreement that health profession schools, particularly medical and nursing schools, should include information about complementary and alternative medicine (Berman, 2001; Frenkel & Ben Arye, 2001; Sampson, 2001; Weil, 2000; White House Commission on CAM Policy, 2002). By 1997, two-thirds of medical schools offered elective courses in CAM or included such information in required courses (Wetzel, Eisenberg, & Kaptchuk, 1998). The National Insti- tutes of Health has awarded grants to develop and evaluate educational approaches to integrating CAM into health professions' education (http://nccam.nih.gov). Nonetheless, CAM education\u2014 whether training in specific CAM techniques or the introduction of fundamental principles\u2014is still a relatively small part of conventional medical education (White House Commission on CAM Policy, 2002). post-graduate and continuing education Although a few residencies have begun to offer and even require rotations in CAM (Kemper, et al., 2000; Muscat, 2000), and curriculum guidelines and course evaluations are beginning to be published (Kemper, et al., 2000; Kligler, Gordon, Stuart, & Sierpina, 2000) most conventional residencies have not integrated CAM information into their curricula. Few opportunities exist for conventional practitioners to acquire sufficient education or training in CAM to feel confident and competent in complementary medicine. Those opportunities that are available require significant time and personal commitment (White House Commission on CAM Policy, 2002), with the prac- titioner often resorting to the development of his or her own individualized curriculum. While reliable and timely publications about CAM and integrative health care are becom- ing more common, they are still not widely accessible. For example, journals carrying the bulk of new information about CAM are non-mainstream and may be under-subscribed by medical librar- ies. Moreover, with few colleagues or mentors available, the conventional practitioner may lack guidance in choosing sources and weighing the quality of CAM evidence. Educational opportuni- ties are increasing, however, and the increasing demand for education or training in CAM is giving rise to such innovative programs as the Integrative Medicine fellowship associated with the Univer- sity of Arizona, started by Dr. Andrew Weil (White House Commission on CAM Policy, 2002). research validation: perceptions and needs For many conventional practitioners, the chief impediment to implementation of inte- grated health care is a perceived lack of quality research in complementary/alternative medicine. A non-validating study result for a specific modality or a single-case report of adverse events associated with CAM treatments can rapidly dampen enthusiasm for integration. Despite the paucity of well-designed studies, conventional practitioners rely heavily on research reports since personal experience and success or failure in use of CAM with patients is often lacking. Many conventional-care providers are discouraged by the lack of readily available evidence sup- porting the value of integration in their routinely read literature. Specifically, they want\u2014but oftenINTEGRA TING COMPLEMENT ARY & ALTERN ATIVE THERAPIES WITH CONVENTION AL CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE F DEPARTMENT OF PHY SICAL MEDICINE & REHABILIT ATION F SCHOOL OF MEDICINE F UNIVERSITY OF NOR TH CAROLIN A AT CHAPEL HILL F \u00a9 200413 cannot find\u2014evidence related to outcomes for specific therapies conditions. Other factors that provide a negative impression of complementary care include: Conventional care advocates have often emphasized negative studies and side effects of complementary medicine (e.g., the few reported cases of cervical complications of chiropractic). There is evidence of a significant publishing bias in favor of studies of conventional medical treatment as compared to studies of complementary therapies. For example, a randomized blinded trial of peer review of two manuscripts that were identical except for the nature of the intervention (one being an orthodox and the other an unconventional treatment for obesity), found a 3:1 rating in favor of publishing the orthodox treatment study (Resch, Ernst, & Garrow, 2000). Funding devoted to the study of complementary and integrative approaches has been sparse (but is now increasing). The \"total amount of funding for integrative medicine [research] in the United States in the past decade is less than the average cost for developing 1 drug in conventional medicine\" (Shang, 2001, 613). Few CAM therapies are patentable, and thus the financial payoff from research is low, relative to pharma- ceutical products. This limited funding and lack of financial incentives has contrib- uted to the lower quality and scarcity of CAM research. Clinical studies in complementary care are often of questionable quality in terms of hypothesis, design, statistical analysis, or conclusions; expectations of \"bottom line\" answers about the value or merits of many CAM therapies is unrealistic in a field that so recently gained the attention of mainstream research institutions. Much of the research is published in CAM-related publications and other non-stan- dard journals with an undefined quality of peer review, although increasingly, main- stream health-care journals are devoting space to CAM therapies. Individual CAM therapies or holistic treatment approaches challenge the application of standard research methods for assessing efficacy. For example, in designing a randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial, it may be impossible to blind the practitioners to the nature of the treatment. There is a need for skillful application and appreciation of other research designs. In addition, there is an urgent need to familiarize researchers with issues involved in developing meaningful CAM research. With growing national research support and an increasingly broad spectrum of conven- tional medical journals publishing CAM research, the basis for these criticisms is diminishing somewhat, but is likely to remain a concern for many years. financial disincentives There are numerous financial disincentives to integration\u2014from the personal costs of time and education, to staff and insurance expenses\u2014but chief among them is the lack of third-party reim- bursements for many complementary therapies. Venture capital was available in the early-to mid- 1990s for start up of integrative clinics, but, with limited reimbursements, profit margins were slimTHE CONVER GENCE OF COMPLEMENT ARY, ALTERN ATIVE & CONVENTION AL HEAL TH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE F DEPARTMENT OF PHY SICAL MEDICINE & REHABILIT ATION F SCHOOL OF MEDICINE F UNIVERSITY OF NOR TH CAROLIN A AT CHAPEL HILL F \u00a9 200414 to non-existent and the funding dried up rapidly (Faass, 2001). Change in this area will require new policies and practices on the part of insurers, medical professionals and national and state legisla- tive bodies. In order for these changes to occur, more high-quality studies must be published demonstrating positive outcomes of CAM therapies, and insurers' negative biases or lack of knowl-PERSPECTIVES ON INTEGRA TIVE HEAL TH CARE Consumers, practitioners, and society all bring different perspectives, needs, and challenges in the process of integration. patient From a patient's perspective, integrative health care represents, foremost, a wider range of valid, safe health and healing options than currently available through conventional medicine alone, participating at the center of health-care decision making, and working in true partnership with providers (Weiger, et al., 2002). Patients should be fully informed of the risks and benefits of treatments under consideration and take personal responsibility for health recovery and maintenance (Astin, 1998). Open communication between patient and all providers is essential to realize these benefits. In many integrative settings, consumers are encour- aged to recognize and use their intrinsic self-healing abilities and are assisted in creating a personal definition of health that is operational, practical, cost-efficient, and appealing (Giordano, Boatwright, Stapleton, & Huff, 2002). Understanding that body, mind, and spirit are fully integrated in both health and disease is fundamental to developing a personal program of integrated medical care. health care providers For health care practitioners, successful integration requires specific knowledge of the patient's medical and psychosocial history, physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual state, and an understanding of the breadth of treatment options available. For conventional providers, knowledge of CAM therapies and approaches need not be accompanied by specific skills in the application of those treatments. Integration can occur by way of referral to CAM practitioners as long as there is adequate documentation of therapies, an open attitude toward collaborating with other health-care providers, and effective communication among practitioners. In addition, for conventional health-care providers to succeed in integrating complementary medicine, certain basic attitudes, beliefs and behaviors are essential: Intentional consideration and use of both CAM and conventional resources in promoting health, preventing disease, and guiding treatment choices; An attitude of openness toward alternative models of health and healing based on evidence of efficacy, personal experience, and positive outcomes for patients; A willingness to explore the health-related goals of both patient and caregiver in an open atmosphere of balanced partnership; Professionalism and respect for other health-care providers participating in patient care; A significant effort in optimizing communications among colleagues; Acknowledgement of improved standards of training for all modalities practiced; Adopting a scientific approach to healing practices; Demonstrating self-care strategies that blend conventional and complementary practices. health care system From society's perspective, integrative health care raises issues related to basic beliefs about the nature of health and healing, resource allocation, and clinical outcomes (Kessler, et al., 2001). Integrating health care requires the recognition and resolution of a number of politically sensitive issues, including consumer access to care, control of provider credentialing, scientific credibility, funding, and the structure of third-party coverage. As noted by Cohen, these factors are fully interactive such that health care providers, consumers, regulatory agencies, and legislators are constantly reshaping the process of integration (Cohen, 2002).INTEGRA TING COMPLEMENT ARY & ALTERN ATIVE THERAPIES WITH CONVENTION AL CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE F DEPARTMENT OF PHY SICAL MEDICINE & REHABILIT ATION F SCHOOL OF MEDICINE F UNIVERSITY OF NOR TH CAROLIN A AT CHAPEL HILL F \u00a9 200415 edge concerning CAM must be addressed (Pelletier, et al., 1999). Complementary approaches are often held to a higher standard of evidence than is afforded conventional practices. For example, the efficacy of hypnotherapy and biofeedback is well established, yet many major health insurance programs do not cover these therapies. licensing and legal risk A particularly thorny set of issues for conventional practitioners and for health-care con- sumers relates to licensure, regulation, certification, and privileging of CAM providers in the conventional medicine context. Relatively well-defined training and certification programs govern some CAM practitioners, such as chiropractic physicians. For others, such as professional homeo- paths or aromatherapy practitioners, training and certification standards are more uneven. Licen- sure, as well as licensure requirements, for most CAM practices varies from state to state (White House Commission on CAM Policy, 2002). For example, while most states license the practice of acupuncture by non-physicians, some states require MD supervision or referral (White House Commission on CAM Policy, 2002). For some consumers, a lack of such standards or licensure may imply a lack of societal approval or legitimacy. As a result, patients may be afraid to disclose their use of those therapies to their conventional providers. Similarly, conventional care providers may equate lack of licensure with incompetence. In an excellent summary report, Cohen (2002) encourages conventional prac- titioners to become familiar with the laws in their state regarding complementary care, since it is at the state level that such laws are enacted and enforced. Cohen also advises that law in this area is changing rapidly, and regular review of recent changes is important in limiting liability. Legal risks are greatest for the conventional practitioner attempting to practice integrative care in the following circumstances: When patients are referred to a CAM provider without informed consent or adequate education about the type of therapy provided; When the condition is fully treatable by conventional means and non-standard therapy is used with a resulting delay in treatment or diagnosis; When patients are referred to a complementary practitioner who is known to be incompetent; When a patient is jointly treated by a conventional provider and a CAM practitioner known to be incompetent; and When a condition known to be treatable with a complementary approach is not so treated, especially in the face of failure of other therapies (Cohen, 2002). approaches to integrative health care Many models of integrated care delivery are possible. For the conventional practitioner, integration may involve acquiring specific knowledge and skills of one or more complementary/alternative modalities sufficient to practice at some level, networking with CAM providers, or simply feeling comfortable talking to patients about their use of CAM modalities. At the other end of the spec-THE CONVER GENCE OF COMPLEMENT ARY, ALTERN ATIVE & CONVENTION AL HEAL TH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE F DEPARTMENT OF PHY SICAL MEDICINE & REHABILIT ATION F SCHOOL OF MEDICINE F UNIVERSITY OF NOR TH CAROLIN A AT CHAPEL HILL F \u00a9 200416 trum are more complex models such as multidisciplinary practices, where a mix of complementary and conventional practitioners share space, and interdisciplinary practices, which involve various levels of integrated patient management through a partnered arrangement. One type of practice does not neces- sarily evolve into other, more elaborate, arrange- ments. The initial form and subsequent devel- opment depend on practitioner interests, re- sources, experience with integration, motiva- tion, skills, and the ability to adapt within the culture of integration. On the following pages are descriptions of seven different approaches to integration. (The Appendix\u2014 Models of Inte- grative Care \u2014on pages 34-35, provides a brief, comparative review of this information.) While these seven models describe general approaches to integration, each inte- grated practice also reflects a unique and personal professional journey for those involved. The practitioners who choose the path to integration do so for many reasons that ultimately shape the new practice's final design. There are some areas of the country, such as New Mexico, where CAM practices have a long history. In central North Carolina (which includes the cities of Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill), the decade of the 1990s saw increasing interest in alternative and complementary medicine, with an influx of CAM practitioners and a growing interest among local practitioners in gaining CAM skills and experience. M any of the integrated care models described above can be found here. Brief descriptions of a number of the integrated practices are included in sidebars on the next several pages. We are grateful to the practitioners involved for sharing their histories and philoso- phies. Their stories offer valuable lessons about the process of creating an integrated medical practice, as well as a glimpse of some of the options and considerations involved in charting a new path in health care practice. model 1: the informed clinician In this simplest type of integrative practice, a conventional provider becomes knowledgeable about one or more complementary therapies, and is therefore better able to communicate and accurately inform patients about their use. An example of such an approach is a family-medicine physician who becomes knowledgeable about herbal/supplement therapies and mind-body therapies for conditions commonly seen in the clinic. The physician regularly asks patients about their use of CAM and is open to their responses. Although communication and information sharing is the primary goal in this model, the health professional may recommend certain CAM approaches, such as a particular nutritional supplement, mind-body, or body-work therapy, as part of a care plan,HOLISTIC F AMIL Y PRACTICE James Dykes, MD, was well ahead of the CAM curve when he opened his practice, Integrative Health Care, in the mid-1980s, after graduating from Duke Medical School and earning board certification in family practice. After completing his second year in medical school, he took a three-year break to become an organic farmer. Farming, he says, led to the discovery that \"nature heals itself. To en- hance the health of the soil, a good farmer needs to carefully study and replicate what he sees happening spontaneously in nature. A good farmer does as little as possible beyond this. In farming, I drew the parallel with medicine.\" Because he values the holistic approach with his patients, Dr. Dykes places great emphasis on listening and understanding of many aspects of a patient's life, and typically sees only eight or nine patients a day. He has refrained from partici- pation with insurance programs of any kind, in the belief that current plans and programs are a barrier to practicing humane and effective medicine. Dr. Dykes explores conventional and CAM options on behalf of his patients. After 17 years of practice, he feels tremendous gratitude toward his patients who have made his practice so rewarding.INTEGRA TING COMPLEMENT ARY & ALTERN ATIVE THERAPIES WITH CONVENTION AL CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE F DEPARTMENT OF PHY SICAL MEDICINE & REHABILIT ATION F SCHOOL OF MEDICINE F UNIVERSITY OF NOR TH CAROLIN A AT CHAPEL HILL F \u00a9 200417 based on patients' openness, research findings and optimizing outcomes (Gordon, 1996). For each complementary/alternative therapy studied and incorporated into the practice, the clinician must understand: The basic assumptions inherent in the complementary modality relating to health and healing; The principal decision-making strategies for that therapy; The typical scope of the disci- pline, including specific exclu- sions; Methods for applying the treat- ment; Any inherent side effects; Any known adverse interactions with conventional treatments. Initial benefits of this approach are improved patient communication, improved ability to provide information to patients on safety and efficacy of CAM therapies, and, to a limited degree, ability to make informed suggestions about patients' use of complementary practices. The conven- tional provider may also benefit personally through CAM-directed self-care. This model has limitations. The provider may not be knowledgeable about subtle distinc- tions that guide CAM therapy choices; there is no mechanism for feedback from CAM community providers other than patients' reporting of their experiences; and it may be difficult to track out- comes specifically related to integrated therapies. Often, practitioners initially adopt this approach to satisfy patients' inquiries about CAM in their areas of practice or to provide guidelines for use of herbals and supplements, including their interactions with conventional drug therapies. As practitioners gain experience through listen- ing to patients and reading the literature on CAM, they may be inspired to begin a limited use of CAM therapies within their practice. Motivation may include increased breadth of therapeutic choices, improved rapport with patients, and improved symptom management. Education may be largely self-study. While no credentials are necessary, study is likely to require several hours of reading a week and two conferences/workshops a year. Costs\u2014for books, an on-line herbal information service, and conferences\u2014are moderate. Risks to practitioner repu- tation and patients are low. This approach usually requires more time for education per patient visit. Ultimately, the benefits are likely to be improved patient care and, perhaps, enhanced physician satisfaction and improved reputation with patients. Ideally, this model of integrated practice would evolve to directly contacting and visiting local CAM providers such as massage therapists, nutritionists, or pharmacies, so as to provide a more accurate referral source for patients. The practitioner may also provide educational materials and train staff to educate their patients; provide on-line access to an herbal information service;EXPANDED PHARMACY SERVICES Tom Jones Drug Health & Wellness Center in Garner, NC, and Central Pharmacy/ Central Compounding Center in Durham, NC, are representative of a number of phar- macies in the Triangle offering certain clinical services and testing, along with wellness counseling, and emphasizing patient education programs, especially in the areas of diabetes, cardiovascular health, and respiratory illnesses. Tom Jones, RPh, in Garner and Bill Burch, RPh, Jennifer Burch, PharmD, and Sloan Barber, PharmD, in Durham work closely with national organizations that provide testing and other resources, including diagnostic work by naturopathic physicians, for clients that they counsel in their pharmacies. They have a special clinical interest in bio-identical hormone re- placement therapy, for both women and men. These pharmacists emphasize the importance of their role in the triad that includes physician, patient, and pharmacist. Patients' physicians must sanction this clinical work before it begins. Dr. Burch has regular hours within several medical practices where she counsels patients\u2014espe- cially diabetics and patients with heart disease\u2014on the proper use of medications and issues related to nutrition and proper exercise.THE CONVER GENCE OF COMPLEMENT ARY, ALTERN ATIVE & CONVENTION AL HEAL TH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE F DEPARTMENT OF PHY SICAL MEDICINE & REHABILIT ATION F SCHOOL OF MEDICINE F UNIVERSITY OF NOR TH CAROLIN A AT CHAPEL HILL F \u00a9 200418 begin using herbals/supplements in self-care, or develop a local resource list of mind-body thera- pies. Feedback in the evaluation of this approach comes primarily from patients and personal and clinical experience with CAM therapies and outcomes. model 2: the informed, networking clinician This type of integrated practice builds on the first model, adding informal referral networks with CAM practitioners to the provider's growing breadth and depth of knowledge of complementary therapies. Building a referral base depends on exploration of local resources, patients' and col- leagues' referrals, and personal experience. Visiting the CAM practice environment and meeting with each provider face to face is important, as is discussion of needs for communication and documentation. Mutual understanding and trust develop with multiple interactions over time. The conventional practitioner may choose the number and types of referrals made and the degree of interaction with each complementary practitioner, with continued interactions being contingent on outcomes, patient feedback, and ongoing communication. Autonomy of each practitioner is main- tained. An example of this approach is found in the University of North Carolina Headache Clinic, in Chapel Hill. Here, a neurologist integrates the skills and services of local CAM practitioners as he refers his patients with migraine and other forms of head and neck pain. These complementary therapies include acupuncture (on- and off-site), herbal medicine, naturopathy, hypnosis, Tradi- tional Chinese Medicine, craniosacral therapy, homeopathy, and neurolinguistic programming (NLP). A major advantage of this model over Model 1 is that it offers a broader range of treat- ment options for patients, including use of established community referral patterns when institu- tional policies limit complementary practitioner credentialing for on-site therapy. Patients may feel empowered by visiting CAM practitioners and providing feedback to the conventional provider, thus furthering the development of attitudes of self-care for the patient. Limitations include lack of control of documentation; lack of face-to-face time between practitioners for discussion of cases; difficulty in tracking patient follow-through and outcomes; inconvenience to patients who must travel to different sites to follow through with treatments; uneven credentialling of CAM providers; and lack of third-party coverage for complementary services. Risks to patients and reputation are small when referral networks are created and maintained responsibly. There is a slight increase in overall legal risk if the con- ventional practitioner attempts to control the scope of therapy provided by the CAM practi- tioner to which he/she referred the patient. In this case, if there is a negative outcome in a patient interaction with the CAM practitioner, the patient may attempt to hold the conventional provider liable for the alleged failings of the CAM practitioner. Although additional credentials are notBOARD CERTIFIED IN UROLOG Y AND HOLISTIC MEDICINE Mark McClure, MD, FACS, trained in Indiana as a conventional physician and completed a residency in urology at the University of Pennsylvania. He practiced in a conventional urologic group until 1997, when his increasing interest in CAM modalities inspired him to partner with a member of the Amercan Holistic Nurses Association, Cheri Elliott, to establish Landmark Urology and Complementary Medicine. Dr. McClure was the first urologist to become board certified by the American Board of Holistic Medicine in 2000. He lectures frequently and has written textbook chapters, journal articles, and a book about conventional and complementary therapies for urologic problems. Cheri Elliott graduated from the UNC-Chapel Hill Adult Nurse Practitioner Program in 2004. Together they offer their patients a holistic approach to urologic health.INTEGRA TING COMPLEMENT ARY & ALTERN ATIVE THERAPIES WITH CONVENTION AL CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE F DEPARTMENT OF PHY SICAL MEDICINE & REHABILIT ATION F SCHOOL OF MEDICINE F UNIVERSITY OF NOR TH CAROLIN A AT CHAPEL HILL F \u00a9 200419 required for the conventional practitioner, additional resources are needed beyond that of Model 1. These include time for initial visits and follow-up communications with CAM providers and costs of personal education about CAM, including books, on-line CAM services, seminars, and profes- sional meetings. It may also require more time per patient visit to educate patients about the rea- sons for CAM referral, to describe the nature of the treatment to be administered by the CAM practitioner and to arrange for follow-up. The path for Model 2 begins with Model 1, and includes increased research and experience in the use of specific CAM therapies for specific conditions, development of clinical pathways that include CAM therapies, and networking and personal expe- rience with local CAM providers. Careful documentation of outcomes is essential to measuring success in this model. Feedback for evaluation comes from patients, CAM practitioners and other caregivers, and personal experience. model 3: the informed, CAM-trained clinician In this next model, the conventional practitioner, who may or may not have already developed referral networks, adds specific training in CAM therapies to a basic knowledge of CAM. An example of this model is an established, conventionally trained MD in general practice who be-BRINGING EAST AND WEST TOGETHER IN A COLLABORA TIVE CLINIC After 27 years of practice in a university medical school setting\u2014both as physician and administrator\u2014pediatrician Michael Sharp took the first steps to a different kind of practice: training as an acupuncturist and Chinese herbalist. The training and exposure to a different perspective on healing led him to create Plum Spring Clinic\u2014a small integrated medical clinic in Chapel Hill, NC, that draws on a variety of healing modalities in a collaborative practice model. \"Our goal,\" says Dr. Sharp, \"is to integrate western medical practices with a wide range of scientifically based complementary and alternative medical therapies. We have found these combinations can dramatically improve our patients' health and well-being.\" He notes that the practice \"specializes in the care of people with conditions that are unresponsive to conventional treatment, such as chronic pain, fibromyalgia, low-back pain, chronic sinus infection, tension and migraine headaches, and stress.\" Plum Spring staff includes: a physiatrist who aslo practices acupunture; a holistic women's health nurse practitioner who utilizes bio-identical hormone replacement therapy; a physical therapist; a doctor of oriental medicine; massage therapists; a nurse trained in manual lymphatic drainage therapy; and a movement therapist. The clinic offers individual consultations and treatment as well as classes in yoga, tai chi, qigong, and topics in alternative medicine. Dr. Sharp describes the clinic's approach as a collaborative process: \"We refer to each other, hold weekly staff meetings, visit other practitioners in the community, talk over coffee/tea, share magazine articles, discuss what distinguishes us and what is similar about us. We are energized by the belief that we are exploring unexplored treatment combinations. We have immense respect for our differences and our capacity to see together what we can't see individually.\" This works, he says, \"because we all believe none of us has the answer but that by early next week we will have discovered it by some act of synergistic alchemy.\" As one of two licensed MDs in the practice, Dr. Sharp sees most new patients first, then offers them options and asks how they would like to proceed. He sees the patients in follow-up if not involved as one of the primary treating practitioners, and works with them to reassess progress and consider further options.THE CONVER GENCE OF COMPLEMENT ARY, ALTERN ATIVE & CONVENTION AL HEAL TH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE F DEPARTMENT OF PHY SICAL MEDICINE & REHABILIT ATION F SCHOOL OF MEDICINE F UNIVERSITY OF NOR TH CAROLIN A AT CHAPEL HILL F \u00a9 200420 comes a licensed acupuncturist by taking a course with certification provided by a na- tionally recognized training organization, and then becoming licensed in the state. A principal advantage of this ap- proach is that the documentation of indica- tions and outcomes are under the immediate control of the clinician. Another advantage is that the practitioner accumulates personal experience in applying a complementary therapy. This approach requires documenta- tion of training or credentialing, and liability insurance covering the newly acquired skills (Cohen, 2002). Feedback for evaluation of this approach comes from patients, other provid- ers, personal experience, and HMOs. Among the motivating factors for pursuing this model is a desire to expand professional skills, treatment options, and to add billable procedures to the practice mix. Credentials are desir- able for legal purposes as well as for providing the patient with some reassurance of adequate training in the given modality. There is an investment of time and other costs. For example, acu- puncture training may involve three to four weeks away from practice, plus several hours per week for video viewing and reading. The investment in books, travel, tuition, equipment, and time away from work is substantial. The gains are in practitioner satisfaction, enhanced patient care, improved reputation, and billable procedures. This approach involves relatively little risk to reputation or patients, although the addition of services not typically covered by insurers may increase the complexity and cost of practice management. Further, working providers will have limited time to devote to in-depth training in a CAM therapy or system in the continuing education context (i.e., brief course sessions, at-home study). Emersion in CAM training typically requires time off from clinical practice. Thus, the service offered based on CE study would be qualitatively different from that of a specialist in that therapy or system. The path to Model 3 may be directly from Model 1, but may include Model 2. The practitioner's path may lead further to a career shift, involving a major emphasis in a CAM modal- ity, training in other complementary modalities, and collaborating with additional complementary practitioners. model 4: multidisciplinary integrative group practice In this model, practitioners provide both conventional and complementary therapies in a partner- ship, often focused on specific clinical issues. A distinctive feature of this model is that while practitioners work collaboratively in the same office setting, patients see different providers in the clinic, although cross-referrals happen regularly. Theoretically, the case manager could be any oneMEDICAL ACUPUNCTURIST COLLABORA TES WITH CAM PROVIDERS IN P AIN CLINIC Jos\u00e9 Armstrong, MD, trained in his native Puerto Rico where he completed his internal medicine residency. Upon moving to North Carolina, he became a staff physician with Blue Ridge Clinical Associates in Raleigh. Dr. Armstrong opened Carolina Healthcare Providers in Raleigh as a model CAM practice devoted princi- pally to pain relief and pain management. Participating providers include Chinese medical doctors with expertise in neuropsychiatry and acupuncture; a chiropractor; naturopathic physician; massage therapists; certified craniosacral therapists, and specialists of other modalities such as aquatic therapy and bodywork. First contact with the practice can be with and through any one of these practitioners. Dr. Armstrong trained in the rigorous program in medical acupuncture at the University of Califor- nia at Los Angeles Medical School, and has served as an instructor there in medical acupuncture since 1995.INTEGRA TING COMPLEMENT ARY & ALTERN ATIVE THERAPIES WITH CONVENTION AL CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE F DEPARTMENT OF PHY SICAL MEDICINE & REHABILIT ATION F SCHOOL OF MEDICINE F UNIVERSITY OF NOR TH CAROLIN A AT CHAPEL HILL F \u00a9 200421 of the care-providers, and the choice should be in the hands of the patient in most instances. For example, the patient may initially enter the clinic to see the non-physician acupuncturist for back pain, and then the acupuncturist may refer the patient to the internist for further evaluation. An example of this approach is The Texas Back Institute, in Plano, Texas. This group specializes in the treatment and management of back pain and includes an orthopedist, an osteopath, a family prac- titioner, a massage therapist, and a biofeedback therapist working collaboratively in the same 2001; Coile, 1995; Pristave, Becker, & McCarthy, 1995). A major advantage of this model is its ability to focus on specific clinical areas, such as family medicine, women's health, pain, geriatrics, or rheumatological disorders. Lower overhead is also possible due to shared office space and support personnel. Among the major limitations are the risks of greater financial vulnerability due to variability in productivity among staff and possi- bly legal risks to the practice if key personnel do not have adequate credentials (Cohen 2002) . A key motivating factor here is the desire to focus on a specific health problem in a collaborative, integrative fashion. Although this model requires no additional training in each associates' modality, additional education is required for each associate to become ad- equately familiar with the others' discipline. Costs are incurred in the start-up phase and for space, staff, and development of a busi- ness plan. Attention must be paid to the mix of personnel, including appropriate training and credentials for each practitioner. A factor to consider is the significant differences in beliefs, training, and practice styles of the partners. This can lead to confu- sion about the role that each plays in decision making and care of a given patient. Clearly identifying the primary \"case manager\" for each patient is important in this setting to im- prove communication between practitioners, to direct care plans, and to avoid conflicts over patient care. In this model, there may be chal- lenges in working out financial arrangements and risk/reward assignments because of the uneven reimbursements by insurers. Up-front payments for some but not all services may create confusion for clients. The benefits can be considerable. Early detection of non-response to conven- tional care can result in earlier integration of CAM therapies. The practice design permitsINDIVIDUAL PRACTICES WITH FOCUS ON ALTERNA TIVE TREA TMENTS FOR CHRONIC HEAL TH PROBLEMS Two physicians in the NC Triangle area, John Pittman, MD, and Dennis Fera, MD , practice separately in non-conventional ways that are described as functional medi- cine. Dr. Pittman, trained at the master's level in biochemistry, earned his medical degree in Georgia and completed the pediatric residency program at NC Baptist Hospital in North Carolina. He established the Carolina Center for Integrative Medi- cine in Raleigh in 1994. It serves patients with a wide range of health needs, including a variety of chronic disorders. Says Dr. Pittman, \"Our approach is to view the body in the most complete way possible, especially function on the cellular nutrient level and restoration of normal digestive function.\" Therapies employed include chelation, IV vitamin and mineral therapies, natural hormone therapy, nu- tritional supplementation, colon hydrotherapy and nutritional detoxification, mas- sage therapy and energy work, and lifestyle and nutritional counseling. Notes Dr. Pittman, \"These complementary therapies create an environment where cellular vitality and wellness are efficiently restored.\" An interest in treating pain led Dr. Fera to CAM therapies. He opened his practice, Holistic Health & Medicine, in Hillsborough. Dr. Fera completed a resi- dency in rehabilitation medicine at New York University Medical Center in 1987, and began his exploration of alternative therapies shortly thereafter when he real- ized \"my formal training often fell short of relieving my patients' pain and disease, and simply did not fit my own 'mind-body-spirit' approach to healing.\" Like Dr. Pittman, Dr. Fera sees many patients with long-term chronic problems who have exhausted their conventional medical options. He offers a variety of integrative treatments to his patients, including chelation, oxidation, ultraviolet light, prolo- therapy, neural therapy, natural hormone therapies, nutritional medicine, and stom- ach and intestinal screening and treatments. Both doctors offer Meridian Stress Assessment evaluation within their practices.THE CONVER GENCE OF COMPLEMENT ARY, ALTERN ATIVE & CONVENTION AL HEAL TH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE F DEPARTMENT OF PHY SICAL MEDICINE & REHABILIT ATION F SCHOOL OF MEDICINE F UNIVERSITY OF NOR TH CAROLIN A AT CHAPEL HILL F \u00a9 200422 highly focused efforts as well as the clear definition of treatment protocols and outcomes. Further, the openness to considering and applying reasonable treatment strategies may enhance practitio- ners' reputations among patients and referral sources, as well as increase patients' satisfaction. There is the potential for cross-fertilization of ideas and synergy of therapeutics in this model because of the practitioners' proximity each other and familiarity with approaches to care. The evolution of this model may include expanding staff to include other CAM providers (herbalist, Reiki healer, etc.) and expanding treatment focus to other conditions/age groups. Other developments, such as the inclusion of group therapy, may help empower patients with support and information. Feedback for this approach comes from group members, patients, other caregivers, and HMOs. Of all the models presented here, this one may provide the optimal mix of ease of implementation, efficient delivery of patient care and enhanced caregiver growth. model 5: interdisciplinary integrative group practice A further level of integration takes place in this model, in which care providers in multiple disci- plines see patients together as a team. As in Model 4, the focus is often on a special area, such as chronic pain or women's health. The team leader is often a physician, although other team leaders are also feasible. The case manager may be the physician or another health-care professional. In one version of this model, each conventional care provider has some training in a CAM discipline. For example, team members in the UNC Integrative Medicine Clinic, which focuses on the treat- ment of chronic pain, include a physiatrist with expertise in Traditional Chinese Medicine, a neu- rologist with expertise in hypnosis and neurolinguistic programming, a pharmacist with expertise in herbal and nutritional therapies, a clinical psychologist with expertise in mind-body therapies, and a physical therapist with expertise in body-work therapies. In addition to a core team that sees each patient, auxiliary team members, such as a homeopath or Feldenkrais practitioner may be asked by the team leader to address the need of a specific patient. Larger group practices may include multiple primary and auxiliary teams. For example, the East-West Health Centers in Den- ver, CO, includes nine conventional provid- ers (four family practice physicians, two in- ternists, one osteopath, one dermatologist, and one physiatrist) as well as six CAM pro- viders (herbal medicine, chiropractic, natur- opathy, acupuncture, hypnosis, NLP, and ho- meopathy) who come together as teams to see individual patients (Herre & Faass, 2001). An advantage of this model over the preceding one is that patients obtain an inter- disciplinary perspective on their illness as well as a comprehensive treatment plan, with fol- low-up that may address multiple issues\u2014in essence, one-stop care for many patients. In addition, this model, even more than the pre- ceding one, encourages expanded educationalMULTI-DISCIPLINAR Y PAIN MANAGEMENT CENTER IN NORTH CAROLINA Alan Spanos, MD, is among the small group of conventional practitioners in the Triangle who turned to CAM before the 1990s. Trained at Oxford, Duke, and UNC Schools of Medicine, Dr. Spanos is board-certified in family medicine and trained in internal medicine and anesthesiology. As a clinical associate, he teaches pain man- agement at the UNC School of Medicine. Dr. Spanos is known as a doctor who will explore any reasonable option on behalf of his patients. (\"Adding acupuncture to my practice has been the most refreshing and invigorating thing I have done in years,\" he once noted.) His practice, Blue Ridge Clinical Associates in Chapel Hill, NC, is a multi-disciplinary pain management center. Patients who come to the center are required to have a primary care physician as the first-line doctor in case management who will work with Dr. Spanos and his colleagues.INTEGRA TING COMPLEMENT ARY & ALTERN ATIVE THERAPIES WITH CONVENTION AL CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE F DEPARTMENT OF PHY SICAL MEDICINE & REHABILIT ATION F SCHOOL OF MEDICINE F UNIVERSITY OF NOR TH CAROLIN A AT CHAPEL HILL F \u00a9 200423 opportunities for practitioners, as their daily interactions stimulate continual cross-disci- plinary learning and discussion. Success de- pends on the openness and communication skills of group members. Depending on ar- rangements, this model may offer financial cross-coverage as well as an improved nego- tiating position with respect to HMOs and other insurers. Disadvantages may include dif- ficulty arriving at consensus regarding over- all goals or resolving financial inequities among the various participants. Potential dif- ficulties include working through different operating assumptions about the nature of healing. Motivation for the development of this model typically involves a desire to ad- dress medical problems comprehensively yet efficiently. However, additional time outside of direct patient care is required for discus- sion of patients and organizational issues. A case manager may be required to screen patients for the clinic and organize the clinic visits. Although little additional training is required of the indi- vidual practitioners, knowledge and skills grow with team interaction and with individuals' con- tinuing education. There are some additional costs and legal risks\u2014an evolving system of this size needs flexibility in space allocation and additional overhead in the form of support staff. This practice model evolves with the expansion of staff to include other complementary providers and sub-specialization as practitioners discover areas of particular expertise and success. Evaluation of this approach comes from patients, group members, insurers and local referral sources. model 6: hospital-based integration This approach integrates conventional and CAM services under the auspices of a hospital or major medical center. This model has two key goals: to improve patient and family experiences of health care in an inpatient setting; and to honor a commitment to provide integrated care. Pioneers in integrative health care include the Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (Zappa, 2001), the Institute for Health and Healing at California Pacific Medical Center (Stewart & Faass, 2001), Hennepin County Medical Center (Canfield, 2001), and a number of hospitals that are affiliates of the Planetree Network (http://www.planetree.org). Such examples provide insight into the logistics, efficacy, and value of combining complementary and conventional care (Faass, 2001). Although each approaches \"integrative\" health care in a unique way, all seek to expand patient care options; to improve communications and patient-caregiver relationships; to reduce dependency on pharma- ceutical and technological interventions in favor of more natural treatments; and to provide aA COLLABORA TIVE HEALING ENVIRONMENT Health Space, as described by its founder and principal clinician, chiropractor Brett Hightower, is a \"multi-dimensional health practice\" in Raleigh, NC. Practitioners include Dr. Hightower, who is also an acupuncturist; a massage/bodywork thera- pist, a naturopath and exercise physiologist, and a certified hypnotherapist. Collec- tively, they provide a range of complementary and alternative healing services, including chiropractic, acupuncture, physical therapy, oriental wellness, tai chi, yoga, hypnotherapy, massage, personal training, aromatherapy, and reflexology. At the heart of the practice, however, is a collaborative \"journey to health\" program. While it is possible to sample Health Space offerings in a selective way\u2014 simply taking tai chi classes or seeking pain relief, for example\u2014most clients enter a partnership with the team of clinicians on a highly individualized \"journey to health.\" Notes Dr Hightower: \"They rapidly come to understand the inter-related- ness of mind, body, emotional, and spiritual aspects of the healing process.\" The \"journey to health\" program emphasizes the process of healing and at- taining wellness. Each client first completes an extensive Personal Wellness Profile, which forms the basis for an individually designed health plan, supported by vari- ous clinicians at Health Space.THE CONVER GENCE OF COMPLEMENT ARY, ALTERN ATIVE & CONVENTION AL HEAL TH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE F DEPARTMENT OF PHY SICAL MEDICINE & REHABILIT ATION F SCHOOL OF MEDICINE F UNIVERSITY OF NOR TH CAROLIN A AT CHAPEL HILL F \u00a9 200424 greater attention to wellness, disease pre- vention, and self-care, which should lead to improved outcomes for their patients. Costs associated with implementa- tion at this level include time and personnel dedicated for planning and staff education, consultation fees in the start-up process, and renovation costs. Credentialing is required for comple- mentary/alternative care providers working in the hospital settings, but licensure may not be necessary if administrative permissions are granted. The only significant risks are those to the hospital/medical center's reputation if community perceptions of complementary medical practices are negative. As with the other models of group practice, there may be difficulty in achieving agreement by participants, and there are po- tential financial problems related to compen- sation and reimbursement. The benefits of the model include improved patient care and satisfaction and enhanced reputation. Other potential benefits are the retention of nurs- ing and service staffs and an increased com- petitive edge for the hospital regionally. Ad- ditionally, there may be opportunities for vol- unteers to participate in programs supporting patient-centered care, such as healing arts and ani- mal-assisted therapies. There must be acceptance and leadership by hospital administrators who are likely to judge the program based on patient satisfaction surveys and costs. Physicians and other staff members should be included in planning and implementation. Utilization of hospital re- sources usually depends on competitive allocation, based on perceived needs and the potential for attracting patients. Hospital-based integrated practice evolves from concept to pilot projects to expanded implementation in multiple parts of the institution. Feedback to evaluate this approach comes from patients, staff members, hospital/center administrators, and outside agencies that evaluate patient satisfaction, such as Press-Ganey Associates. model 7: integrative medicine in an academic medical center Integrative medicine within an academic medicine center weaves together teaching, research, and clinical care and facilitates expanded awareness and understanding of CAM and integrative care among health-care providers, increased integrative clinical services, and increased research initia-AN INTEGRA TIVE PRACTICE A T A TEACHING HOSPIT AL Launched in October 2002, the Integrative Medicine Clinic at the University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill) offers an interdisciplinary consultation and treatment service for those patients with chronic pain and other conditions who wish to integrate conventional and complementary approaches. The Clinic team includes a physi- atrist, neurologist, clinical pharmacist, psychologist, physical therapist, nurse, and administrative coordinator\u2014all with integrative medicine skills\u2014who participate with patients in a comprehensive review of physical, emotional, mental, and social aspects of their condition. Medical students and residents often participate in the clinic as learners. Following an initial evaluation, team members see patients for up to six months for interdisciplinary assessment, individualized care planning, implementation of care, and collaboration with a primary caregiver for ongoing management. Pa- tients actively participate in developing and carrying out the treatment plan and make a minimum commitment of 12 weeks to the program. Recommendations for therapies such as acupuncture, massage, hypnosis, biofeedback, mindfulness train- ing, herbal medicine, and nutritional counseling are applied in an individualized, culturally respectful, values-oriented manner. The goals of the program are to improve quality of life and increase function. A guiding principle is promotion of the body's self-healing abilities. Emphasis is on non-pharmacological options, with medications modified after consulting with the patients and their primary phy- sicians. Patients are encouraged to let go of old, maladaptive patterns of thought and behavior that may prevent seeing each situation as unique and full of potential, and to view and experience the process as a journey towards wholeness.INTEGRA TING COMPLEMENT ARY & ALTERN ATIVE THERAPIES WITH CONVENTION AL CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE F DEPARTMENT OF PHY SICAL MEDICINE & REHABILIT ATION F SCHOOL OF MEDICINE F UNIVERSITY OF NOR TH CAROLIN A AT CHAPEL HILL F \u00a9 200425 tives. The University of North Carolina Program on Integrative Medicine is an example of this approach. This program and the University's Departments of Family Medicine, Neurology, Physi- cal Medicine and Rehabilitation, and Obstetrics and Gynecology have cooperated to develop and sustain a teaching program in complementary medicine that involves students, resident physicians, faculty, and community practitioners. Clinical services developed through this effort include a CAM consultation service and an integrative medicine clinic that provide teaching opportunities and additional resources to the community. M ajor limitations include difficulty in credentialing CAM providers within the Health Center for provision of clinical and educational services, and the high cost of providing services in an educational setting. Academic health professionals, who typically combine clinical care with teaching and research, are drawn into the integrative medicine arena through the needs of their patients or research initiatives. Administrative costs and staff support may be funded by research grants or by public or private endowments. Educational risks to the reputation of the institution are minimized by emphasizing an evidence-based approach, as well as by demographic statistics describing pa- tients' increasing use of CAM and the responsibility of the academic medical community to pro- vide education about CAM therapies. Well-designed research projects raise awareness of CAM therapies in a safe and supportive environment, with the potential stigma of undertaking non- mainstream research offset by the validation of receiving external funding, such as NIH grants. Employing credentialed CAM providers for clinical services can minimize legal risks. Impediments to this model include the heavy reliance on MDs to practice CAM and the need to operate under multiple administrative umbrellas with their associated political and financial pres- sures. The issue of CAM provider credentialing is also a challenge, as is the likelihood of multiple interest groups competing for limited resources. The benefits of the academic model include improved patient care and exposure of students, residents, and faculty to CAM, as well as multiple opportunities for both basic and clinical research. This model may evolve on many levels: expansion into the medical center departments and divisions in the areas of teaching and clinical care; expansion of integrative patient care through consultation and research; and through outsourcing CAM therapies to the community when health center policies cannot accommodate complementary medicine providers. Feedback for evaluation of this approach comes from patients, students, residents, faculty, administrators, press, public, and HMOs (Carlston, Stuart & Jonas, 1997). steps towards integrating CAM with conventional practice A complex mixture of options and barriers influences conventional practitioners toward or away from integration. These factors are shaped by individual and interpersonal experiences as well as personal beliefs, institutional policies, and societal forces. They include caregiver openness, health- care administrative support, community resources, availability of educational and training oppor- tunities, and concern for patients' safety and care quality. Control over these many factors varies considerably. For example, while decisions regarding personal education may be largely under personal control, more difficult to influence are institutional and societal barriers such as limited third-party reimbursement for CAM services.THE CONVER GENCE OF COMPLEMENT ARY, ALTERN ATIVE & CONVENTION AL HEAL TH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE F DEPARTMENT OF PHY SICAL MEDICINE & REHABILIT ATION F SCHOOL OF MEDICINE F UNIVERSITY OF NOR TH CAROLIN A AT CHAPEL HILL F \u00a9 200426 The models of integration described above are merely examples of many possible varia- tions; the form that develops is unique to each situation. Also unique are individual providers' paths toward integration, which may initially be triggered by diverse events\u2014a colleague's or patient's report, a research article, or a personal experience of illness. The resulting steps toward integrative practice are likewise individualized, often gradual and circuitous, with auspicious coin- cidences along the way. Nevertheless, it is possible to outline a structured, formalized process for moving towards integrated practice, beginning with a few initial steps that are crucial for success. These \"first steps to integration\" are simple, relatively low-cost activities that set the stage for the development of an integrated practice. They include assessing beliefs, acquiring knowledge, and adopting new atti- tudes and behaviors. assessing beliefs The process begins with a critical first step\u2014an inventory of personal beliefs about ill- ness and healing. Practitioners may never have completed such an inventory, even during medical training. From this honest appraisal there may come a renewal of motivation and compassion in the service of others, along with a desire to acquire new skills and knowledge for enhancing care giving. Reflection on the principles of complementary care ( see box on page 4 ) in terms of one's personal beliefs and care practices should aid in this process. These principles include an emphasis on patient/healer communication and self-care that form the foundation for integrated practice. accessing and acquiring knowledge Next comes an honest self-assessment of one's personal knowledge base of complemen- tary and alternative practices. Reviewing a textbook on CAM or integrative medicine may provide an initial basis for this assessment. One starting point is to become knowledgeable about at least one CAM therapy, including evidence that supports its use and possible adverse effects. Ideally, one should survey the breadth of CAM therapies and systems of healing, in- cluding their principles and assumptions re- garding illness causation and management. Selected CAM topics can then be explored in further depth, depending on interest and area of desired specialization. Excellent continuing education courses and self-study materials are available, including good-quality research reports in peer-reviewed journals. (See the UNC Pro- gram on Integrative Medicine's Information Sources for Complementary & Alternative Thera- pies as well as other publications in this se-THE P ATH TO CHANGE The move to a new, integrative model of care requires: Assessing beliefs about healing, and appreciating the value of principles of complementary/alternative care Identifying reliable sources of information about CAM and beginning to ac- quire knowledge Developing and maintaining methods for keeping up-to-date on CAM and integrative medicine research Appreciating the political and economic factors shaping medical practice and public health policy Communicating with patients about CAM Documenting clinical experiences Developing quality relationships among CAM and conventional caregivers, and supporting those exploring new models of care.INTEGRA TING COMPLEMENT ARY & ALTERN ATIVE THERAPIES WITH CONVENTION AL CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE F DEPARTMENT OF PHY SICAL MEDICINE & REHABILIT ATION F SCHOOL OF MEDICINE F UNIVERSITY OF NOR TH CAROLIN A AT CHAPEL HILL F \u00a9 200427 ries, listed in the front of this publication.) Conferences provide opportunities for training as well as networking. Training in one or more CAM modalities is another option. Observation, personal experience, and/or instruction in specific applications of complementary/alternative methods with local practitioners can be valuable learning strategies. Further, it is important to develop and maintain methods for keeping up-to-date with reports on CAM-related basic research, clinical outcomes, and complications arising from integra- tive approaches. Examples include subscribing to key journals or initiating a journal club. More- over, becoming knowledgeable about CAM requires being well informed about various contextual issues that affect integrated practice, including the political and economic factors influencing medi- cal practice and public health policy. communicating with patients/ clients Skillful communication with those who hold diverse belief systems is essential for profes- sionalism in health care. To assess skills in this area, consider the following questions: Does his- tory-taking routinely probe the details of CAM use? Do conventional providers listen to their patients' experience with alternative-care providers, and their sources of information? Are these therapeutic approaches investigated? The basis for effective communications is an attitude or be- lief in a partnership with patients, with shared responsibility in therapeutic planning and imple- mentation. This partnership is, in essence, an opportunity to communicate and learn from each other. To insure success, both patients and caregivers must abandon paternalistic expectations and attitudes in communication and care. communicating with CAM providers Success also depends on practitioners' connections with individual CAM providers and integrative practices. Personal contact with these providers\u2014through referrals, visits, or colleagial gatherings\u2014is critically important. It is particularly helpful to visit the community practice set- tings of CAM providers, who may include chiropractic physicians, herbalists, massage therapists or shamen. Where feasible, it would be worthwhile to gain personal experience in the therapy. Developing a friendly professional relationship with these providers may offer the basis for effec- tive collaborative patient care buillding on clinical experience Conventional health professionals may be relieved to find that that they can build on previously learned skills and experience in shifting to integrative health care. New skills, abilities, and knowledge may be incorporated with conventional clinical skills, diagnostic abilities, and knowl- edge under a new conceptual framework. As with any clinical care, it remains important to record clinical observations about nega- tive and positive outcomes, including patient satisfaction with both complementary/alternative and conventional therapies. This information can provide a base of experience that will guide future interventions and referral choices and perhaps lead to the development of ideas for research projects.THE CONVER GENCE OF COMPLEMENT ARY, ALTERN ATIVE & CONVENTION AL HEAL TH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE F DEPARTMENT OF PHY SICAL MEDICINE & REHABILIT ATION F SCHOOL OF MEDICINE F UNIVERSITY OF NOR TH CAROLIN A AT CHAPEL HILL F \u00a9 200428 developing professional networks Professional development will benefit from the support of like-minded colleagues, both locally and through national professional organizations. These support systems should include interdisciplinary networks. Such affiliations provide opportunities to share experience, address common issues and seek additional education and training. They may also lead to increased appre- ciation of the broader societal issues that accompany the integration of CAM with conventional care, including the need for political, regulatory and organizational changes. additional resources needed Adequate resources are an obvious requirement for successfully integrating a practice. Investments of time and money vary widely, depending on the model of integration and the types of education, training, personnel, facilities, or equipment desired. The required education may require significant amounts of time and money, and some models of integration involve increased costs for facilities or equipment, such as massage tables or herbal-information databases. These investments may often be made feasible by incorporating them at a pace suitable to the provider. conclusion Integrative medicine is a visionary concept taking form in a number of directions around the United States. As many sectors of society (patients, providers, third party payers, government) seek answers to the problems of modern western medicine (cost, efficacy, safety, access, cultural limits) leaders in integrative medicine have led the way and continue to emerge. Many of these innovators have had to take considerable risks, often standing alone on their professional reputations. Recent seekers of integrative health care have more tools and support at their disposal than ever. Attitudes are changing and experience with CAM therapies is growing along with oppor- tunities for research. The extent to which licensed providers can offer new services to patients will depend on the legal, regulatory and political environment. Despite challenges, many creative solu- tions are being tested by integrative providers attending to the business of clinic administration and the pursuit of accessible, affordable health care for a broad array of potential patients. There are many sound arguments for moving toward integrative health care, and the human heart will always lead the way.INTEGRA TING COMPLEMENT ARY & ALTERN ATIVE THERAPIES WITH CONVENTION AL CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRA TIVE MEDICINE F DEPARTMENT OF PHY SICAL MEDICINE & REHABILIT ATION F SCHOOL OF MEDICINE F UNIVERSITY OF NOR TH CAROLIN A AT CHAPEL HILL F \u00a9 200429 references Ang-Lee, M.
