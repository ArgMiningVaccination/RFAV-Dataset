It is a form of active disease surveillance designed to locate current disease events and to understand the epidemiological history of the target disease in a specific community. Participatory disease searching makes use of indigenous animal health knowledge as a source of disease reports and intelligence. It is designed to increase the sensitivity, timeliness and repres entativeness of surveillance system. Participatory rural appraisal is a highly flexible tool kit of methods that allows participants to present information in their own words and in the context of their own knowledge systems. Beyond the methods, PRA is based upon a philosophy of an open-mind, learning and respect for all knowledge and views. In PRA, the value of education and training is seen more as providing tools that allow one to respond to new information and situations rather than as a source of ready-made solutions. The objectives of the workshop were to conduct a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis of present surveillance activities, provide basic skills in PRA and PDS, and to deve lop harmonized action plans for the initial implementation of PDS in the Somali ecosystem. The programme of the seven-day workshop (Annex 1) was divided into three sections. The first section consisted of three days of classroom activity where participants discussed basic concepts of PRA and PDS (described in Annex 2) and developed their skills through role-playing and in class exercises. The next three days of the workshop were spent in practical field exercises in the cattle camps surrounding Griftu conducting actual PDS interviews. The participants were divided into four groups, each group conducted their own independent interviews and members of each group took turns leading the activities. The results of the interviews were reported back to plenary meetings of the workshop in the afternoon. The group discussed the results and critiqued each other's methodology. The unedited results of each group's interviews as presented to the plenary are reported in Annex 3. On the last day of the workshop, the participants formed national working groups to develop harmonized action plans for immediate implementation. These unedited action plans are presented in the body of the report. The facilitator would like to note that one of the strengths of PDS is the learning process that experts undergo when in direct communication with livestock owners. This direct experiential learning is a central aspect of all PRA work. Attempts to systematize, localize or compartmentalize PD S at the district, zonal or wereda level will reduce the effectiveness of the approach. Conventional methods of paper reporting and verbal debriefing will not be sufficient to transfer the knowledge gained at the local level between field teams or up the hierarchical ladder of veterinary services. It will also greatly reduce the eff ectiveness of PDS as a disease search tool by reducing the flexibility of teams to rapidly respond to livestock owner reports. The facilitator recommended that countries establish expert teams that could work across 5 the ecosystem or at least broad parts of the ecosystem. These expert teams could incorporate representatives of the local ve terinary authority as they moved between areas. In regard to national training programmes the concern was expressed that in certain cases the proposed facilitators had no actual field experience with the PDS technique beyond what was gained in the present workshop. The workshop identified the need for a training of trainer workshop to further build skills, but it needs to be emphasized that participants will not be qualified trainers until they have gained adequate field experience with the techniques. The participants identified six key recommendations to insure the prompt and effective adoption of PDS activities in national rinderpest surveillance systems. Recommendations The Workshop participants made six recommendations. 1. On the adoption of participatory disease searching, the workshop recommended that: The technique of PDS was found to be a sensitive method of disease surveillance for the detection of RP and RP-like disease as well as for understanding the history of disease circulation in the Somali ecosystem. Participatory disease searching should be adopted without delay as a surveillance technique by all three PACE Projects operating in the Somali ecosystem as an integral part of comprehensive surveillance systems. As the first step in the implementation of PDS, Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia should identify and describe cattle populations at risk based on epidemiologic and socio-economic criteria. 2. On information exchange, the workshop recommended that: Public sources of information such as scientific literature on mild rinderpest should be made available at a common source (AU/IBAR/CAPE website) for use by the three partners. Epidemiologic reports, disease investigation reports and results of PDS should be shared by electronic mail. There should be regular meetings of the PACE National Epidemiologists to sharing information collected through disease searching. Participatory disease searching teams should meet regularly to share information and ideas. There should be transparency on RP information exchange at all levels between all three partners in the region. 3. On harmonization of PDS activities, the workshop recommended: That PACE National Epidemiologists with the facilitation of the East African Regional Epidemiologist should harmonize and coordinate PDS as part of disease surveillance in the ecosystem. Border district field officers should establish direct communications with their counterparts and harmonize cross- 6 border PDS activities through meetings, workshops and synchronized activities. 4. In regard to training, the workshop recommended that: A training of trainers (TOT) workshop should be held for five to ten participants who have completed this PDS workshop in order to further develop skills and develop capacity for the transfer of skills. The workshop noted that the facilitator(s) of the PDS TOT should have both TOT and PDS skills, that the workshop should last two weeks, and that the training should be completed before June 2003. 5. On community-based disease surveillance, the workshop recommended: That national veterinary services, projects and NGOs should establish specific frameworks for the incorporation of community-based animal health worker networks within general disease reporting systems. All such information should be channelled through the district level animal health authority using a mutually agreeable process. 6. On future workshops, it was recommended: That a five to seven day workshop should be held in June 2003 at Jijiga, Ethiopia to review the RP situation in the ecosystem and progress on the implementation of PDS Action Plans. That meeting should review the results from: hunting for mild RP using PDS serological studies questionnaire surveys other conventional techniques The meeting recommended that CAPE and PACE facilitate the Jijiga meeting and that further field training exercises should be included to refresh and expand on participant skills. 7 Somali Ecosystem Surv eillance SWOT Analysis This session began with the participants breaking up into national groups to outline their respective surveillance systems followed by 10 minute reports back to the plenary by a reporter nominated by each national working group. The participants then summarized the relative amounts of emphasis placed on different activities in one table (Table 1) for the whole region. This was to synthesize the three presentations and provide one overview of activities in the region. Thereafter the facilitator introduced the concept of SWOT analysis. The seven indicators of effective surveillance were introduced as follows: sensitivity - able to detect and investigate a reasonable percentage of suspicious events specificity - able to adequately diagnose detected events timeliness - reporting, investigation and diagnosis accomplished in a reasonable time frame relative to the epidemiologic characteristics of the agent representativeness - surveillance information is truly reflects the overall situation without bias due to remoteness, inaccessibility, etc. simplicity - system is implementable under prevailing conditions flexibility - system can adapt to unforeseen events and logistic challenges acceptability - to all stakeholders The results of the SWOT analysis are presente d in Table 2. The participants were then asked to rank the seven indicators of surveillance to identify the priorities for strengthening (Table 3). 8 Table 1: Relative Emphasis of Surveillance Activities in the Current National Surveillance Programmes of PACE/Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia Activity Kenya Ethiopia Somalia Disease Reporting +++ +++ + Serology ++++ ++++ ++++ - +- PE/++ Wildlife Surveillance +++++ ++ + Outbreak Investigation 3 1 0 Note: The number of plus signs indicates the emphasis placed on each activity and do not reflect on the quality of implementation. These are not grades. Under questionnaire surveys, the cell for Ethiopia is split since they placed having emphasis on questionnaires in the past, but Ethiopia is no longer undertaking this activity. In the PDS category, although it was agreed that no country had undertaken any PDS activities in the past, some parts of active surveillance included PRA- like activities such as mapping. The numbers in the outbreak investigation category indicate the number of suspicious stomatitis-enteritis events investigated in the past 12 months. The participants agreed that a total of 4 investigations per year for the entire Somali ecosystem were clearly insufficient. 9 Table 2: SWOT Analysis of PACE National Surveillance Systems in the Somali Ecosystem Strengths Qualified Manpower Structure in Place Background Information Good Funding Overall Weaknesses Cooperation/Acceptance is Low ELISA Technology in Crisis Difficulty in Identifying Disease Not Enough Resources on Active Surveillance Better Definition of Mild RP Needed Sensitivity Specificity - Lab Support Variable Timeliness - Delayed Investigations Access - Representativeness Poor Information Dissemination and Exchange Opportunities Develop Common Understanding Skill Development/Training Build Coordination Build Common Approach: Disease Reporting PDS Outbreak Investigation Border Harmonization Low level meetings between field workers Better Communications Better Info Exchange Review Progress Periodically Threats Bureaucracy Lack of transparency Insecurity Natural disasters Politicization of RP Trade Bans Personal Safety Donor Fatigue Reporting Endangers Careers Performance Indicator Targets not Achievable Note: Participants were asked to identify strengths and weaknesses simultaneous on one flip chart page. The seven indicators of effective surv eillance were used as a checklist to stimulate discussion. Opportunities and threats were discussed in a separate page. 10 Table 3: Ranking of Surveillance Char acteristics Requiring Strengthening Surveillance Characteristic Ranking Sensitivity 1 Specificity 3 Timeliness 2 Representativeness 4 Simplicity 6 Flexibility 7 Acceptability 5 Note: The ranking indicates the participant's pe rceptions on the order of priority of the characteristics of existing surveillance systems re quiring the strengthening. Sensitivity, timelines and specificity, in that order, were identified as the priority areas requiring strengthening if RP is to be eradicated from the Somali ecosystem. 11 Participant Analysis of RP Reports At the end of each practical day, field teams were asked to report back to the plenary and questions on methodology and disease inte lligence were discussed. The detailed reports of the field exercises are presented in Annex II. At the end of each day, historic RP diseas e reports received by each field team were described in detailed. A chart was kept on the wall and only those reports that the plenary felt were first-hand observations, adequately described RP and internally consistent were added. These reports are pr esented in Table 4 in the order of receipt and acceptance.

Question marks indicate that no information was collected for the item. The participants noted an emerging pattern in the da ta, but that more data collection was needed before a full interpretation could be made. Potential cluster areas were 1964-65, 1980-82, 1990- 92, and 1996-99. The reports from 1980-82 and 1990-92 correlated with three previous in-depth studies conducted in southern Somalia and the Mandera/El Wak area. The participants noted that the clinical presentation of mild RP might include only a limited number or only one of characteris tic signs of RP. For this reason, the workshop requested that a separate table be constructed for tabulation of atypical reports that could be consistent with mild RP (Table 5). Only one entry was recorded in this table by the end of the workshop. The participants also noted that reports should be tabulated for analysis by other criteria such as the presence of specific clinical signs or the location of the outbreak. Time did not permit the completion of such important analysis during the workshop. 13 Table 5: Livestock Owner Reports of Atypical Rinderpest ( Shifow and Madobaye ) as Collected by Field Teams and Tabul ated in the Plenary Discussions Respondent Year Location Mortality M.

For this task, researchers need to adopt an investigative, open-ended system of inquiry. Rather than use preset methods and design such as those used in surveys, an inductive approach is used. With this approach, each information gathering exercise generates insights that guide or induce the next stage of the process. The researchers select from a basket of methods those that best suit a particular situation and information need at a particular time and location. Therefore, PDS differs from the kind of 'survey' that many epidemiologists are familiar with. In a survey, sample sizes and survey methods are predetermined and usually decided upon away from the survey area. Ideally, random sampling is used to enable extrapolation of results to a wider population. In practice, particularly in pastoral or remote areas, convenience sampling is used due resource or logistical constraints. This is a survey based on random sampling and a questionnaire. The researchers miss rinderpest either because the rinderpest site was not selected during site identification or, the questionnaire did not include open questions concerning rumours of rinderpest. For mild rinderpest, the questionnaire may not have adequately explored livestock keepers' knowledge of the disease. In practice, this method often suffers from poor pre-testing of the questionnaire and problems with access to randomly selected locations. 10km ______ 28 This is a survey is using convenience sampling . Although at the design stage many surveys aim to use random sampling, in the field convenience sampling is common. The river and lack of roads have prevented the team travelling far beyond the main urban centre. This su rvey suffers from the same weaknesses as random surveys with regards questionnaire methodology. Rinderpest is overlooked because the researchers never physically get close to the disease and again, the questionnaire does not enable full exploration of informants' knowledge on the disease. This is participatory disease searching . Initial interviews and mapping in the village direct the researchers to a particular grazing sites (1 and 2). The team travel by road to the place and there, more interviews, time-lines and proportional piling show that livestock keepers have good knowledge of rinderpest. Although they haven't seen the disease for some years, they've heard rumours emanating from a distant grazing area that is rarely visited. Using mapping, the team learn how best to access this area. They decide to abandon the vehicle and continue on foot to point 3. After two days they reach the rumour area (4) and following more interviews, reach a grazing area with cattle showing clinical signs of rinderpest (5). Recent clinical cases are sampled.

Methods for the collection of action-oriented epidemiological intelligence. FAO Animal Health Manual no.10. Food and Agriculture Organisation, Rome. ISBN 92-5-104523-2. This handout describes participatory disease searching (PDS) as it directly relates to rinderpest. The specific techniques that are most useful are open-ended questions, probing, time line construction, triangul ation (cross-checking of reports), key informants (community leaders, traditional healers, veterinary staff, expatriate technical assistants and international cam paign co-ordination offices), mapping as well as direct clinical observation and transects. Preparations Rinderpest is a disease that depends on the mixing of livestock for survival. There are no known carrier states or examples of chronic infection. The virus survives through the continuous occurrence of new acute cases in susceptible animals. Thus, the virus must continuously find new susceptible animals for survival. A safe, effective and inexpensive vaccine exists that has been successfully applied in most areas where veterinary service delivery is reliable. These factors suggest, and indeed experience has shown, that remote, marginalised pastoral communities, where livestock contact rates are high and vaccination is sporadic, are often the reservoir for the endemic persistence of rinderpest. Rinderpest PDS should take these fa ctor into account when designing reconnaissance missions. As a first step, an inventory of remote cultures and communities should be made and secondar y sources of information should be obtained and researched. In PRA, one often looks at 'proxy indicators' in regard to sensitive subjects for which it may be difficult to obtain unbiased direct information. Remoteness, insecurity, and lack of services can serve as proxy indicators for the likely presence of infectious disease when prioritising search areas at the national level. It is especially important to avoid 'tarmac' or access bias in regard to rinderpest searching. As with any disease investigations, the appraisal team should carry all necessary sampling materials in case a SE outbreak is encountered. In addition, the team should carry Clearview tests and a camera, if these are available. Photographs of affected animals and lesions are supporting data for diagnostic purposes and in some cases become invaluable training and communication materials. In general, it is better to involve a representative of the veterinary services from the national level as members of the study team who is not known by community members. Local representatives of the veterinary services are included in the study as key informants. The presence of local veterinary authorities in the appraisal team can introduce bias as the respondents may wish to avoid sensitive subjects. Incorporation of local officials in the study team makes the process less anonymous and confidential. 30 Interviewing As with other types of disease searches, the interviewer should be careful not to communicate their specific interest in rinderpest to the respondents. If possible avoid travel in vehicles used in rinderpest control activities or with individuals locally known to be specialised in rinderpest control. The interview should be introduced as a general study of animal health issues in cattle or a similarly broad theme. A sample PRA checklist for rinderpest disease searching is presented in Box 1. Items 1 to 3 introduce the subject and establish the identity of the participants. Items 4 to 6 are an expanding enquiry into animal health problems. Item 4 investigates what animal health problems the respondents are personally and presently facing. Item 5 inquires into what animal health pr oblems the immediate community is presently facing. Finally, Item 6 inquires into the most significant animal health problems the community has faced regardless of time. It is important to note at which stage in the interview process rinderpest is mentioned. Rinderpest should not be mentioned in an interview by the appraisal team prior to the respondents listing of animal health problems. If a respondent introduces the subject of rinderpest, he should be asked to describe the disease as part of the verification process. If the respondent cannot accurately describe the disease, his report should be discounted. A procedure for weighting reports is outlined in Box 2. If rinderpest has been described accurately, the following topics should be probed: 1. Have they had personal experienc e with the disease or did they learn about it from others? 2. If they have had personal experience with a rinderpest compatible event, when, where and in whose cattle did they observe the disease? 3. How severe was the outbreak? What was the relative importance of symptoms? 4. What were the general circumstances at the time of the event (grazing conditions, water availability, security conditions, livestock contacts with other communities and wildlife, trade links, etc.)? Box 1: Sample PRA Checklist for a Participatory Rinderpest Disease Searching Avoid mentioning rinderpest before the cattle owners do. 1. Introduce the appraisal team as an animal health appraisal. 2. Identify the respondents and establish if they cattle owners. 3. Establish their main herding locations (mapping). 4. What are the current cattle disease problems in their herd? If tearing or diarrhoea is mentioned, explore these syndromes in detail. 5. What are the current cattle disease problems in the area? 6. Historically, what are the most important disease problems of cattle? Invariably rinderpest is mentioned in the response to this question if the cattle owners have experienced outbreaks in the last two decades. Frequently it will be the first disease mentioned. 7. Have they personally seen rinderpest in the their lifetimes? What does it look like? 8. When was the last time their cattle where affected by rinderpest? Where? Where did it come from? As warranted, further probing questions can be added to cross-check reports made in other interviews, further define cattle movements which may affect the epidemiology of the disease, or to contrast current outbreaks with previous outbreaks in regard to the severity of disease. 31 5. Has the disease occurred at any other time? Repeat questions1 to 3, as time permits, for each previous occurrence of SE outbreaks. By the end of the interview, if the respondents have not mentioned rinderpest, the study team can inquire directly about rinderpest. In this case, it is important to note that the participants did not volunteer rinderpest as an animal health problem and that despite whatever information is obt ained through direct questioning, rinderpest is not a stated priority of the respondents. It is recommended that the information obtained through such types of direct and possibly leading questioning does not constitute data for epidemiological analysis. With caution, it may serve as background information or leads to prov ide direction to future fieldwork. Topics for Probing Probing on specific subjects can provide very useful insights into community knowledge on disease epidemiol ogy, pathology and diagnostic processes. Often it is best to reserve these probing sessions for especially knowledgeable key informants. These are usually more senior members of the community respected and consulted by the community for their livestock knowledge. Diarrhoeal disease: In a subset of interviews, the community should be probed about the different terms used to describe diarrhoeal disease. Points to be investigated are: What terms are used to signify diarrhoea in general? Are different types of diarrhoea distinguished (i.e. bloody vs. non-bloody, acute vs. chronic, etc.) What specific diseases do they associate with diarrhoea? What indicators are used to differentia te between different diarrhoeal diseases? Clinical forms of rinderpest: At appropriate times, subsets of respondents should be probed about the relative severity of di fferent rinderpest events they have observed over the years. If diarrhoeal diseases are being described, but not identified as rinderpest, respondents can be asked how this distinction is made. In light of the occurrence of mild rinderpest, this is an espec ially important theme for exploration in Box 2: Weighting reports of rinderpest Concerning assessing reports, the following weighting criteria may serve as an example for the categorisation of volunteered reports from individuals who can accurately describe the disease: I. A first hand report from a herder of cases in his own herd. II. A first hand report of clinical cases obse rved by a veterinarian or veterinary assistant. III. A report of cases directly observed by a cattle owner but in other's cattle. IV. A second-hand report or hearsay from veterinarians, herders, public officials or elders who did not actually see the disease. This last information should be noted and may be used as leads to assist the team in selecting locations for further study, but should not be used as data in the construction of maps and time lines or other forms of analysis. The individual reports that are internally consistent from categories I, II and III can be tabulated and mapped to build a consensus view of the historical and recent incidence of the disease in the region. 32 East Africa. Some communities may distinguish rinderpest as a disease that kills and rule out rinderpest as a diagnosis of non-fatal diarrhoea. It is important that the appraisal team adequately identify the criter ia for traditional rinderpest diagnosis and establish if any clinical forms of rinderpest are excluded from the local traditional definition. Disease concepts and methods of rinderpest transmission: It is useful to attempt to understand local concepts regarding the cause of disease and methods of transmission. In regard to rinderpest, pastoralists can often accurately describe risk factors and types of contact that lead to transmission. Knowledge in these areas varies significantly between communities and it is important not to make assumptions. Community responses to rinderpest: Understanding community responses to rinderpest, either endemic or epidemic, can cont ribute to risk analysis in regard to the spread of the disease or provide insight into the mechanisms of endemicity. Some responses to rinderpest that have been noted in the past are: 'Quarantining' affected herds by making them graze away from unaffected herds or water after other herds Avoidance of wildlife Running away from outbreaks Traditional vaccination Informal quarantine is a method used by several communities in response to a variety of disease situations. It is one of the more desirable responses as informal quarantine does work to reduce contact rate. As with most great plagues, a popular desire to flee is a frequent response. Although this may benefit individuals temporarily, it has the obvious effect of facilitating spread of the disease through increased contact rates over greater dist ances. Traditional rinderpest vaccination is an interesting practice that is probably no longer used. At least all known descriptions are historic. Mapping Rinderpest is a disease that depends on cattle contact and movement for its very survival. Mapping of cattle movement and determination inter-community contact is a very important activity in regard to understanding local rinderpest ecology. In order to initiate a mapping exercise, respondents should be asked to specify their primary grazing sites by season. Depending on the complexity of the bio-climatic system, it may be worth constructing a seasonal calendar as a companion exercise. Often, pastoralists will specify location names that are not evident on modern maps. These initial questions often turn to a discussion of just exactly where these key resource sites are which naturally leads to the sketching of maps on the ground. A broad area about an arm and a half's reach should be cleared and smoothed. Usually, participants will naturally gather round and equip themselves with the necessary tools: normally sticks and other obj ections to assist in drawing and act as land marks. The participants should first be asked to indicate key landmarks such rivers, market towns, major wells or watering sites. Then the grazing sites can be indicated. In addition to normal grazing si tes, emergency-grazing areas used in time of drought or insecurity should be indicat ed. The participants can also indicate the territories occupied by other communities and points of contact as well as shared or 33 contested resources. During the mapping process, information can be collected on the nature of the interaction with neighbour ing communities (e.g. trade, competition, raiding, hostility, etc.). Eventually, the map will become crowded with information and it will be time to stop and transfer the information to note books. If desired, the mapping exercise can be repeated in later sessions for the collections of other types of data such as the location of forests, bush and crop areas, or wildlife distribution. Later, the different types of information can be analysed conceptually as layers, much as in geographic information systems. For rinderpest epidemiology, the data on mo vement, mixing (contact) and trade will be the most significant. These will be key factors in subsequent risk analysis and in disease control strategy design. Movement and contact data relative to the presence of the virus will determine where and when vaccination or surveillance is appropriate. Clinical Observation, Sample Collection and Transects Before or after an interview, it is always useful to walk the camp, herd and adjacent environment. In rinderpest disease searching, tearing is a sign that can be detected at a distance. If you are walking the herd prior to the interview and note tearing, it is best not to call attention to the sign. Proper clinical exams should be carried out after the interview. The only exception is when the livestock are on the move and you run the risk of losing the opportunity. If you are unfamiliar with the temperament of local breeds or they are know to be aggressi ve, due caution should be exercised. If active rinderpest is reported or tearing is noted, a complete clinical exam of affected animals is essential. Detailed notes on the individual history and clinical presentation of each animal should be taken. After examination, clinical cases compatible with the SE outbreak definition should be sampled. In any event, the appraisal team should take a moment to investigate any examples of current health problems the livestock owner s would like to present. This gives the study team an additional opportunity to cross check disease descriptions with actual clinical cases. Further, as the livestock owner has donated his valuable time to the study, it is only appropriate that the team take a moment to investigate the farmer's concerns and provide useful advice. Bear in the mind the problem of creating false expectations. It is best not to promise or su ggest any future assistance. The provision of free drugs, although it may seem helpful and even be enjoyable, contributes to the creation of false expectations and perpetuates the psychology of dependence. If drugs are required, the best solution is often to provide the farmer with a verbal or written prescription and advice on where they can be purchased. Analysis of Results Participatory disease searching is somewhat different from other types of PRA. Most PRA interviews start at a general level and work towards specifics. The interview technique used in PDS casts an ever-broadening net until the respondents volunteer rinderpest as a problem. At this point the interview begins to focus down on EVK regarding rinderpest. This could happen at any of three levels: current personal experience, current personal observation or in the past. Part of the process of judging the quality and significance of reports relates to when the respondent introduces the subject of rinderpest. The earlier in the interview process that the subject is raised, the more significant the report (see Box 2). 34 As described previously, reports of rinderpest or other SE events should be categorised, tabulated and examined for trends or unifying factors. This process should begin in the field and be carried on throughout the study. The lessons learnt during the PDS will lead to the reformulation of hypothesis, new questions and modification of the criteria of analysi s. Always bear in mind that rinderpest intelligence may be sensitive information at any level of the system from the herder to head of veterinary services. The key is to remain flexible, patient and open-minded throughout the process. The existence of the stomatitis-enteritis outbreak definition and guidelines for comprehensive rinderpest surveillance assists in the analysis of rinderpest PDS results. If the community's terminology fits the SE outbreak definition, then the reports collected as part of the PDS should enter in the rinderpest report registries. If the community consensus points to the circulation of rinderpest or another SE agent, then the investigation should continue until a definitive diagnosis is reached. The principals of comprehensive rinderpest surveillance and performance monitoring require that the PDS should continue until active cases are found for sampling. In the event that active SE cases cannot be found, then a purposive serosurvey is indicated. In the event that a PDS detects a rinderpest focus and representative cases are confirmed, then all the cases that are epidemiologically linked to the confirmed case are themselves confirmed. The linked cases are all those that fit the same clinical description and were determined to be in contact or for which a chain of transmission can be reasonably assumed. In regard to ri nderpest, a chain of transmission could be reasonably assumed where herds share a watering hole or grazing area. In the event that a detailed PDS detects a rinderpest focus and representative cases are not confirmed, then the epidemiologica l intelligence gathered by the PDS should form a working hypothesis for future disease control efforts in the area. The PDS result can be used to formulate future surveillance and vaccination tactics. The PDS may also serve as a research hypothesis for further detailed epidemiological studies using both qualitative and quantitative techniques. The need to conduct further research must be balanced with action-oriented needs. This is especially the case in regard to vaccination activities that will preclude serological investigation or may obscure clinical disease without achieving eradication. It is better to have a full understanding of the epidemiological and ecologic al dynamics of the disease prior to embarking on extensive vaccination programmes with vague objectives. 35 Annex 3: PDS Reports of Field Teams 14/11/2002 PDS Exercise at Griftu Team Passion Respondents: Ali Nur Mohamed A d e n G a r e Two ladies and seven children Methodology Introduction Visual appraisal Transect drive / walk Interviews Mapping Ranking and scoring Introduction: Dr. Mwongela introduced the team and seeked permission to examine the animals.
