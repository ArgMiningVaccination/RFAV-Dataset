This handout explains what patients who take warfarin (Coumadin) need to know before they take herbal products. Patient Education Anticoagulation Cl inic Herbal products are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) like prescription and over-the -counter medicines are. Herbal products can be sold without adequate safety testing and without evidence that they produce the desired results. While herbal products can provide benefits, there a re many that do not work well with warfarin. Some herbs may put you at higher risk for bleeding complications, and some may make you m ore prone to developing clots. If you are thinking about using any herbal product or dietary supplement, your Anticoagulation Clinic pharmacist can help you make an informed decision. Quality In most cases, herbal products are produced without standards for quality control. This can compromise their quality and purity. Herbal products may contain varying amounts of the active ingredient, unlisted ingredients, or potential contaminants. Th is can result in: Instability of the product. Inconsistent effects from different products that a re labeled similarly. Toxicity (too much of the product in your body at o ne time and/or unwanted side effects). Page 2 Anticoagulation Clinic Herbal Products Effectiveness Before any prescription drug can be placed on the m arket, the FDA requires that the product be tested for effectivene ss. Because herbal products are not regulated, there is still very lit tle scientific evidence that proves their effectiveness. Therefore, even th ough these products may not do as they claim, they may remain on the ma rket as long as they are not shown to be dangerous. Safety Herbal products may cause adverse reactions, just l ike traditional medicines can. The short- and long-term effects of herbal products have not been studied. The safety of these products for children, pregnant women, the elderly, and other special popu lations is not known. Those who have allergies, especially to plan ts or pollen, should use caution when using any herbal medicine. Herbal Products and Warfarin Herbal products, just like many foods and drugs, ma y interact with warfarin. Many herbals contain substances that are similar to warfarin and may put you at a higher risk for bleeding compl ications. There are also herbal products that work against the actions of warfarin and can make you more prone to developing clots. Talk with your pharmacist about any herbal products you are thinking about taking while you are on warfarin to make sure you are not putting your health at risk. The tables on the next page list some common herbs that can either increase your risk of bleeding or increase your risk of forming blood clots. These he rbs should not be taken while you are on warfarin. Signs of Bleeding Complications Unusual bleeding from gums. Prolonged nosebleeds. Red or dark urine. Bruises that do not go away. Coughing up, throwing up, or spitting up blood. Warning Signs of Blood Clots Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg, especially on one side of the body. Sudden confusion.
