Symptoms will range from person to person, with some being more intense than others.

Black cohosh Black cohosh is a perennial plant from North America traditionally used by Native Americans. Studies show that [black cohosh](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/BlackCohosh-HealthProfessional/) has promising results for alleviating hot flashes and mood swings. The less severe hot flashes can offer potential improvement in sleeping and fatigue levels. Hot flashes can continue well after menopause since estrogen levels change. Black cohosh should only be used for 6 months or less. If using for longer, consult a physician. St. John's wort St. John's wort can be used as a mood booster, especially in times of mood swings. St. John's wort is often combined with black cohosh for menopausal symptoms, which can help with hot flashes, irritability, and insomnia. Not only can St. John's wort curb symptoms, but the plant might offer improvement to sexual well-being as well.
