Sacred Touch Essential Oils Essential Oil Benefits and Uses Essential oils are the extracted oils from various plants and herbs that are concentrated for some therapeutic benefit. They can be used for health purposes, aromatherapy, cleaning, and beautification. Ayurvedic medicine has its roots in their use and certain essential oils are iconic scents for different cultures. The earthy, spicy aromas of sandalwood, cinnamon and ginger are a common Indian blend, while in Egypt eucalyptus, cyprus, and cedar were some of the most favorited scents. These ancient cultures had an array of different blends and purposes for individual oils, used to treat ailments or anoint the dead before burial.

If we can cut out those synthetic ingredients and focus more on the organic compounds found in essential oils, we may be able to solve some basic ailments without putting so many chemicals into our bodies. Rhododendrons, Essential Oils and Challenging Conditions Next Article Stem Cells From One's Own Body Show Efficacy in Treating Pain Stem cell therapy is still a relatively new concept that few understand, but it continues to garner a lot of support and promise \u2014 especially for medical problems that have traditionally been very difficult to treat. In his fascinating [discussion](https://www.gaia.com/video/the-stem-cell-solution-for-pain?fullplayer=feature) with Open Minds host Regina Meredith, naturopathic doctor Harry Adelson N.D. reveals a new way to address pain by using stem cells as curative agents. This may come as a welcome idea for at least a [fifth](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db390.htm) of the population, who suffer from chronic pain that affects quality of life, the ability to work, sleep patterns, and more. [According to the Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bone-marrow-transplant/in-depth/stem-cells/art-20048117) stem cells create other cells with specialized functions, and \"[u]nder the right conditions in the body or a laboratory, stem cells divide to form more cells called daughter cells. These daughter cells either become new stem cells (self-renewal) or become specialized cells (differentiation) with a more specific function, such as blood cells, brain cells, heart muscle cells or bone cells. No other cell in the body has the natural ability to generate new cell types.\" Adelson, says treatment with stem cells can help treat musculoskeletal pain and increase energy using cells from one's own bone marrow and fat to prompt regeneration. Citing his own use of stem cells on his road to recovery from injury and pain, Adelson says how regenerative therapy using [biological tissues](https://www.hss.edu/condition-list_regenerative-medicine.asp) found in the human body can restore normalcy to someone living with pain and suffering. One of the more exciting aspects of stem cell therapy is that each of us can create our own cells to heal ourselves. Emerging evidence [suggests](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bone-marrow-transplant/in-depth/stem-cells/art-20048117) that adult stem cells can not only replicate, but also create various other types of cells. For example, bone marrow stem cells may be able to create bone or heart muscle cells. Adelson is highly [experienced](https://www.docereclinics.com/) when it comes to using stem cells for pain treatment, having performed numerous procedures using bone marrow combined with adipose (bodily fat) stem cells. He's also injected more than a thousand intervertebral discs with stem cells. Adelson's excitement for stem cell therapy began with an accident as a young man, while rock climbing in the early 1990s. He was in naturopathic school at the time, when an injury to his shoulder set him off in a new direction, leading him to pursue an alternative to traditional surgery and injections for pain treatment. After receiving his naturopathic degree, Adelson discovered the potential of stem cell therapy. "}
