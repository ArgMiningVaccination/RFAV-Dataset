It's been a long process of baby-steps to 'ditch and switch' to natural products but I'm so thankful I started when I did! It's insane just how many toxins go on our skin, in our air, and into our homes every day. I'm talking thousands of them invading our lives DAILY and we don't even realize it. By making my own beauty products and using them for self-care, I can limit exposure and take my health and wellness into my own hands. Plus, they smell amazing, so there's that too. I've realized that self-care is not selfish. In fact, it's essential to finding peace in this busy world of ours, and a necessary part of being able to support others by being strong and healthy ourselves. Making my own products gives me time to reflect on the importance for caring for myself, and the chance to customize the scent and essential oils to my needs. When I need a mood-boost, Valor and citrus scents do the trick! Feeling a little more 'mature' today? Then adding an extra drop of Frankincense into my face serum helps glow-up my aging skin. Here's a round-up of some of my favorite recipes for self-care using pure essential oils.
