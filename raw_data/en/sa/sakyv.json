Researchers believe the high-dose flu vaccine can help prevent more cases of influenza for nursing home residents than the standard vaccine, according to a study from the University of Pittsburgh. The study examined 205 seniors across the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 flu seasons. Blood samples were taken to test the effectiveness of the higher dose and standard vaccines. Higher dose flu vaccines contain four times the amount of antigen to create a stronger immune response in the recipient, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study authors suggest that frail, elderly nursing home residents might benefit from the high-dose vaccine, rather than the standard-dose vaccine. Seniors continue to be highly susceptible to the flu. Adults over the age of 65 are responsible for more than 90 percent of yearly flu deaths. (In total, the flu kills more than 30,000 every year.) But last year's flu vaccine was highly ineffective for seniors living in long-term care, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC does not yet know how strong this year's flu will be \u2014 or how effective this year's vaccine is. That doesn't mean seniors should not get vaccinated this year, however. The flu vaccine remains the best way to prevent influenza, and it can reduce a person's risk of life-threatening complications if they do contract the flu. \"In patients where it doesn't prevent influenza completely, it contributes to preventing pneumonia, hospitalization and death. In other words, it makes a more serious illnesses milder, and that's very, very important,\" William Schaffner, MD, the chairman of the department of preventive medicine and professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tenn., told Weather.com earlier this year. This year also marked the first flu season that allowed people to choose between the standard trivalent vaccine, and a new quadrivalent vaccine, which offers protection against four flu strains rather than three. There are also new options for people with egg allergies this year, according to a letter from the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology.
