[The Chakras are the energy centers running down the mid-line of the body. For those gifted to see these energy centers, they are described as beautifully colored, spinning wheels of energy. ](http://ilenemorrison.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/CHakra-2.jpg) [The Chakra system](http://ilenemorrison.com/services/what-is-theta-healing/) is a reflection of balance and energy flow throughout our being. There are [seven main Chakras](http://ilenemorrison.com/classes/) on the mid-line that mirror emotional, spiritual and physical wellness. Each Chakra is connected to a feeling...an emotion and effects physical health when it is blocked, or weak for to long. When stagnant energy exists in the energy centers of the body it can give a feeling of being stuck or can even manifest as illness. How Can I Help? Through a Chakra reading we can recognize issues that I can see residing in each of the Chakras. These unresolved issues cause weakness in these energy centers as well as out right blockages. This in turn can result in emotional, spiritual and physical problems. In order to [heal & balance](http://ilenemorrison.com/services/what-is-theta-healing/) each of these energy centers I assist in energetically shifting the beliefs and address to you the lessons to be learned that are affecting the Chakra or Chakras. [Shifting the energetic beliefs](http://ilenemorrison.com/services/) helps to increase the flow of energy in each one of the weakened Chakras. The energy shift helps the client gain a new perspective on old hurts or old challenges and provides the space to replace old beliefs and experiences with new expressions thereby attracting new patterns of experience & perception into your life.
