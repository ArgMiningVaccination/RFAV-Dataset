The brain controls thoughts, decisions, memories, emotions, pain perception, autonomic functions like breathing, hunger and sleep, speech, movement, organ function and hormones. The brain has several lobes and nerves, (almost 100 billion nerve cells) and glands and is basically the headquarters to the function of our body). Interesting to me is the connection to digestive health, often called the second brain. It makes sense to me to begin with a healthy gut to help a healthy brain. Newer evidence recognizes all disease to be years in the making, and I believe this especially true to nervous system disease and Alzheimer's. We can minimize any disease progression by first addressing lifestyle factors such as food, stress, sleep, movement, alcohol intake, sugar/ artificial sweeteners etc. Next, eating more of a ketogenic diet makes sense as the brain is made up of mostly fat. Other factors such as mitochondria (cell energy) and the methylation cycle contribute to brain health. Ultimately, digging deeper through naturopathic assessment tools such as nutrient testing, hormone testing and amino acid testing will reveal underlying imbalances and provide a path forward for influencing brain health. As with any naturopathic plan, digestion and gut ecology is essential. Favorite Brain Health Nutrients First and foremost is eating nutritionally dense foods. This means all of your food should be nutrient packed. Especially loading up on fresh fruits and vegetables, good lean protein sources like fish and plant proteins. Next hit the fat-good fats, fish, anchovies, nuts, seeds, nut and seed butter and olive oil. Definitely consider supplementing with fish oil, adaptogenic herbs and amino acids.
