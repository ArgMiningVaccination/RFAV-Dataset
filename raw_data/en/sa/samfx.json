This is for you, the parent. I will equip you with strategies that will work for you and with your child so you feel more empowered to help them even if you don't totally understand what they are going thru. It is not uncommon for tweens and teens to be less than forthcoming with their private concerns, but you will then have some tools to offer support for their well-being. Sometimes a consultation is all that you need and you are able to resolve the difficulties on your own. If additional support is needed, recommendations, resources and referrals will be provided.
