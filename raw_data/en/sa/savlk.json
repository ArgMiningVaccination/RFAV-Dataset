You've taken the first step toward quitting smokeless tobacco and becoming healthier! Quitting tips This guide provides tools to help you quit for good. The information included is based on scientific evidence gleaned from over three decades of helping people stop chewing\u2014and remain tobacco-free. Steps to stopping There are five key steps to kicking the habit: Make a plan. Set a quit date. Ask for support. Manage urges to use. Curb nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Create a plan Follow the steps in this guide to create your own plan to quit. You may have discovered other strategies that helped you quit\u2014if only briefly\u2014in the past. Use those and these tips to make this attempt your last one! 3Smokeless tobacco is tobacco that is not burned. You don't smoke it. Instead, you typically chew it and spit out the brown juices (created by the tobacco-saliva mix) every few seconds. So it must be a safe alternative to smoking tobacco. Right? Wrong! Hazardous to your health? All forms of tobacco\u2014whether chewed or smoked\u2014contain harmful ingredients that can cause cancer and other serious health problems, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warns. Smokeless tobacco is also called spit tobacco, chewing tobacco, chew, chaw, dip, and plug. There are two types: snuff and chewing tobacco. Snuff is a fine-grain tobacco. Users \"pinch\" or \"dip\" it between their lower lip and gum. Chewing tobacco comes in shredded, twisted or \"bricked\" tobacco leaves. Users put it between their cheek and gums. Users typically let the tobacco sit in their mouth and spit often to get rid of the saliva that builds up. This allows the nicotine and other ingredients in it to be absorbed into the bloodstream through tissues in the mouth. What is smokeless tobacco?1 4 Health risks Chewing tobacco can cause painful mouth sores and bad breath, and stain your teeth a yellowish-brown color. It may also cause: Cracking and bleeding lips and gums Gum disease and tooth loss Increased heart rate and blood pressure Cancer Smokeless tobacco also increases the risk of mouth (or oral) cancer, according to the CDC. This can occur in the lips, tongue, roof and floor of the mouth, the cheeks and gums. Some of its cancer-causing agents can also get into the lining of the stomach, esophagus and bladder, the CDC cautions. 5 What's in smokeless tobacco? 2 Smokeless tobacco contains many dangerous chemicals, including more than 30 known carcinogens or cancer-causing agents, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It also contains flavorings and sugar that heighten the risk of gum disease and tooth decay and loss, the FDA says. Nicotine All types of smokeless, like other tobacco, also contain nicotine. Nicotine is highly addictive and makes it hard to quit. Some types of smokeless tobacco are treated with chemicals that make nicotine even more addictive. This is called \"free nicotine.\" The faster nicotine travels from the tissues in your mouth to your brain, the more addictive and harder it is to quit. Large doses of nicotine increase blood pressure and heart rate, risk factors for heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular disease, according to the CDC. 6 Create a plan to quit 3 List your reasons for quitting Perhaps you're motivated by the health risks. Or by the money you'd save by stopping. Or the disgust non-chewers display when they see you chew and spit, smell your foul breath or see your tobacco- stained teeth. Maybe it's all of the above. Check the reasons below behind your decision to quit: I want to improve my health and prevent mouth and other cancers, heart disease and high blood pressure linked to chewing. I want to save money. (Imagine what you could do with the savings!) I want to prevent related bad breath, gum disease and tooth loss/decay. I want to be a better role model for my kids. I want avoid the disgust of (and rejection by) others. I want to feel better about myself. I want to be free of nicotine values You may have started chewing at a young age without regard for potential consequences. Over time, you may have learned or changed your views on what's really important or a core value for you. Core values include things like family, faith, good health, and financial security. Use the chart below to identify your current core values\u2014and if smokeless tobacco fits in with them. (There is an example in first row for how this works.) Core value: What matters to meWhy this matters to meHow using smokeless tobacco gets in the way of what matters to me Example: FamilyI like spending time with my kids and want to be a good parent.My kids say I have real bad breath and they don't want to be close to me and do things together.8Set a quit date A quit date is the day you plan to stop using smokeless tobacco. This date is your choice. But studies show that setting a quit date within two weeks of deciding to stop boosts your chances of success. Circle the date you select on a calendar. Put reminders of your quit date in places where you'll see them every day. This will help you stay on track. Tell friends, family and co-workers about your plans. Ask for their support. 9It's common to want to chew after quitting Among the reasons: Nicotine in tobacco is highly addictive. (See Medicines to help you quit on page 15 for tips on ways to curb nicotine withdrawal symptoms.) You may be used to chewing during certain activities and times of day. Being around other smokers or chewers may tempt you. The good news is that there are many ways to manage urges. It may take a few days, weeks or even months. But you will overcome them\u2014and adjust to being tobacco-free. Take your mind off the urge to chew Some ways to avoid or resist temptation: Workout or take a walk. Get your doctor's OK for any new fitness plan. Change your daily routine, especially during times you typically chewed. Avoid being around smokers and chewers. Tell your smoking/smokeless tobacco friends why you're avoiding them. Other ideas: _____________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________________________ Manage urges 4 10Choose healthier substitutes You may miss having something in your mouth after you quit. Use non-tobacco products as a substitute. Some suggestions: Put sugar-free hard candy or a piece of gum in the corner of your mouth where you held tobacco. Some people find sunflower seeds (in moderation) are a good substitute. Use non-tobacco herbal replacement chew. You can buy this online and in many convenience stores. There's no conclusive scientific evidence this helps. But many of our quitters say it helped them. Confirm the herbal substitute you use does not contain tobacco. (Check the American Cancer Society Guide to Quitting Smokeless Tobacco .) Chew on a toothpick thoughts After quitting, you may have thoughts that make it hard to remain tobacco-free. This \"stinking thinking\" is common and can lead to backsliding. Here are some examples of ways to turn negative into positive or helpful thoughts. 11Practice relaxation and coping techniques Quitting tobacco can be stressful. Relaxation exercises like the following may help ease anxiety. Deep breathing: Go to a place where you can sit and relax. Turn off all electronic devices (your computer, mobile phone, TV). Take a deep breath through your nose and expand your stomach. Hold your breath for five seconds. Gently release breath through your mouth. Wait for five seconds. Say the word \"relax\" out loud. Repeat this for five minutes.Negative thought Positive thought \"Man, I really want to chew tobacco right now. I deserve it!\"\"Yes, I do want a chew. But it will not help me feel better or quit. I know the urge will pass if I do something to take my mind off of it. Plus, I promised myself I would quit.\" \"I can't imagine never having a dip again. So I'll have just one now.\"\"I don't have to quit forever. I just have to stop for today- and I can do that! I should ask my support team for help.\" Other ideas for turning negative into positive thinking: ______________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________12Progressive muscle relaxation *: Sit in a comfortable place free of distractions. (You may prefer to lie on the floor.) Take off shoes. Breathe normally. Note how your body feels from head to toe. Tightly curl your toes as if trying to squeeze a small ball between your toes and the bottom of your feet. Hold curl for 10 seconds. Release and spread toes. Repeat this exercise with your calves, thighs, hands, arms, upper back and face. Breathe deeply for a few moments. Notice how all body parts now feel. *Don't attempt while driving, watching children, operating heavy equipment or doing other things that require your full attention. 13Tobacco-proof your space Get rid of all tobacco products/reminders. It's key to scrap all tobacco products (and reminders) when you decide to quit. Keeping them can make it tougher to quit and stay tobacco-free. The night before you quit, run water over any tobacco you have left\u2014and throw it away. Avoid smokers and other chewers Ask friends not to chew or smoke around you. It can be harder to quit if you're around other chewers/smokers, especially in the first few days or weeks after quitting. Can't completely avoid them? Just say \"no\" . Or think about other responses if offered chew. Keep substitutes (candies, mints, sunflower seeds) on hand to pop in your mouth instead of tobacco. Ask for support Tell family, friends and co-workers you're planning to quit. This makes quitting easier and increases your chances of success. As you prepare to quit, consider who you can (or want to) lean on most. It could be someone you see every day or reach out to in crises. A good place to start is with someone who has already quit tobacco and knows what it's like. Not sure? Pick someone you trust to be there for you. 14How to ask for support It may be hard for you to ask for help. You may feel awkward or like you should be able to do this on your own. One way to approach someone is to say something like: \"I plan to quit chewing on this date. Would be OK if I turn to you for support if things get hard for me?\" Tell your support person (or team) how they can help. You may want them to check in daily to see how you're doing. Or you may just want your support person/team to be there on an 'as needed' basis. It's up to you. So let your support person/team know in advance how you want them to help you. You can also call your program quit coach anytime! 1415When you stop using smokeless tobacco, your body will likely crave the nicotine in it. This is called nicotine withdrawal. Symptoms may include headache, trouble concentrat - ing and/or feeling anxious and grumpy. It's perfectly normal to feel this way. But it's important not to act on these feelings or take them out on others. Try relaxation exercises to control these feelings. Some medi - cines may also help curb nicotine withdrawal. Nicotine replacement therapy NRT helps cut withdrawal symptoms by replacing nicotine without tobacco's other harmful chemicals. The Food and Drug Adminis - tration approved its use to help people stop smoking. But studies show it also helps reduce withdrawal symptoms among those trying to quit chewing. There are five types of NRT. Each delivers what is considered to be safe levels of nicotine\u2014and is typically used for eight to 12 weeks (to replace nicotine in tobacco). Ask your doctor if NRT can help you\u2014and, if so, which type is best for you. Use only as directed. Nicotine patch. This is a patch that sticks to your skin. You apply a patch once a day after waking. It slowly releases nicotine into your body. Patches come in different strengths. They're easy to use. You can buy them over-the-counter (without a prescription) at most pharmacies. Medicine to help you quit 516Nicotine gum. This comes in two strengths: 2 milligrams (mg) and 4 mg. It's typically used throughout the day. Nicotine gum is not chewed like regular gum. You put a piece in your mouth and chew it several times. You then move it to a corner of your mouth and leave it there for several minutes. You chew it a few more times\u2014 and park it in a corner again. The nicotine in it is released and absorbed by the tissue in your mouth. You throw out the gum after using for 20 to 30 minutes. Available without a prescription. Nicotine lozenge. This also comes in two nicotine doses (2 mg and 4 mg). But you don't chew it. You put it in your mouth and move it around. Nicotine is released and absorbed by the tissues in your mouth. Available without a prescription. Nicotine nasal spray. This is a medicine prescribed by your doctor. It's faster acting than the above therapies and is used throughout the day. It's also pricier than the patch, gum and lozenge. Nicotine inhaler. This must also be prescribed by your doctor. You puff on it. It delivers small amounts of nicotine with each puff. You should not inhale the nicotine from this device. It can irritate your throat and lungs. The nicotine in this is absorbed by the tissues in the mouth. Your doctor will tell you how often to use it. It costs more than the patch, gum or lozenge. Combinations of NRT. You can use the nicotine patch with other quit medicines to provide extra relief. The patch provides a steady dose of nicotine. Other types of NRT can be used regularly (throughout the day) or 'as needed' to help combat strong urges to use tobacco. Two other Rx's used to combat tobacco urges are varenicline (Chantix\u00ae) and bupropion SR (Zyban\u00ae). They do not contain nicotine. 17Your doctor or pharmacist can tell you more about all of these medicines. Give your doctor a list of all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter meds, vitamins and supplements. Learn the potential side effects of all medicines. Check to see if your health benefits cover any/all of these therapies. The right way to use quit meds Some people say quit meds did not help them. In many cases, this is because they failed to use them the right way. Always follow directions exactly. Have questions? Ask your pharmacist or doctor. Other tips: Use every day or as recommended by your doctor. Nicotine gum, lozenge, inhaler, and nasal spray are most effective when used every one to two hours daily during the first four weeks of use. Use the gum as directed. Remember: This is not chewed like regular gum. If you chew it like chewing gum it will not work well and may give you an upset stomach. Use the patch every day. Rotate it to a different site each day to avoid itchy or sore skin. Varenicline and bupropion SR should typically be taken starting a week or two before you quit. It's key to follow instructions from your doctor or pharmacist. (See pages 15 to 16 for more info on NRT.) 18Switch to lower-nicotine chew Some types of smokeless tobacco contain more nicotine than others. If you're using a fine-cut type of tobacco, you may try switching to a long-cut variety a few weeks before quitting. Doing this may make it easier to quit because your body will get accustomed to less nicotine. If you choose this option, it's important not to use it as an excuse to take more or bigger dips or chews. Reminder: Less nicotine does not make smokeless tobacco safer. It just means it contains less nicotine per dip. Reduce chews Cutting the number of dips or chews you take is another way to prepare to quit. Keep track of the chews you take each day, and start skipping a few. This will add up as you get closer to your quit date. If you use this method, it's important not to take bigger dips or chews. That will defeat your purpose. Two-week taper method This helps reduce nicotine intake before you quit. To taper more, take an extra week or two longer. Step 1: Track how many dips or chews you take each day for a few days. Record the time of day, what you're doing/feeling, and who you're with when you imbibe. Step 2: Cut your dips by one or two a day. For example, if you normally use 15 dips a day, cut out one of them. By the end of two weeks, you'll ideally be down zero. Other ways to quit 619Step 3: Start using your coping skills and quit meds (if you opt to use one) on your quit date (unless instructed to begin earlier). Call your quit coach as needed. Lean on family/friends for support. Use herbal substitutes Herbal \"spit tobacco\" tastes like but doesn't contain tobacco. You can buy it online or in most convenience stores. (Some brand names: Mint Chew, Golden Eagle\u00ae Herbal Chew and Smoky Mountain\u00ae Herbal Chew.) Confirm any herbal substitutes you get do not contain tobacco. How to cut back with herbal substitutes: Week 1: Record number of tins/pouches of smokeless tobacco you use in one week on calendar on next page. Week 2: Empty the weekly amount of tobacco you typically use on a plate. Remove one-quarter of the tobacco. Mix herbal substitute into remainder. Refrigerate the mix in a sealed container to keep it fresh. Note: It's key to mix tobacco and herbal substitutes together very well. FYI: \"Long-cut\" tobacco mixes better with long-cut herbal substitutes; fine-cut tobacco with fine-cut substitutes. Week 3: Repeat what you did during week 2 only this time take away half of the tobacco and replace with an herbal substitute. Refrigerate in a sealed container. Take out a fresh supply daily. Week 4: This is the week you take the plunge\u2014and quit! 20Types of smokeless tobacco Moist Snuff The most popular form of spit tobacco. This fine-cut snuff typically delivers more nicotine than long-cut tobacco. Some brands of moist snuff have more nicotine than others. Snus This is inserted under the upper lip. There's no spitting because there are no salivary glands in the upper mouth (and, so, no saliva buildup). Most American snus contains more cancer-causing agents (than imported snus). Chewing tobaccoSpit tobacco that often has added sweeteners and is flavored with licorice. Users usually put large wads in their mouth. They chew it. Tuck it in a corner of their mouth. Then spit out the tobacco-saliva juice. Abrupt method (Cold Turkey) Some people prefer to quit abruptly. If you take this approach, you may have more nicotine cravings in the first few days or weeks after quitting.Four week 'cut-back' with herbal substitutes calendar Sun Mon in pellets, twisted sticks (the size of tooth- picks), thin tongue strips, and other dissolvable products. Made from finely milled tobacco. Comes in flavors like wintergreen. Slowly dissolves in five to 20 minutes. No spitting required. Blocks, plugs and braids/twistsAll but twist varieties are typically mixed with molasses or other sweeteners and tightly pressed together into square blocks or plugs. Users break or bite off a chunk, chew it and spit out tobacco juices Iq'mik A mix of tobacco leaves and ash (from a birch tree fungus) most commonly used by Alaskan Natives. Can be purchased at stores in rural Alaska. The ash/leaf combination makes the nicotine easier to absorb when in the mouth. May be pre-chewed into individual \"doses\" and saved in a tin for later use. Gutkha, khaini and pan masala Originated in Africa, India and Asia and available in the U.S. Contains either cut, shredded or powdered tobacco. May be mixed with slaked-lime, ash or other flavorings to boost the nicotine and improve the taste. Often marketed as \"natural\" or \"traditional,\" but carries the same health risks as other tobacco. Dry Snuff Dry powdered form of tobacco. Users place a small amount between their thumb and forefinger and hold it under their nose. They inhale it. It causes some to sneeze. Users may also put a pinch their mouth between their lip and gum. Less popular today.
