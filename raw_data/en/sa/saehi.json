What can you expect? Healing Touch facilitates a deep sense of calm and relaxation as well as overall and specific responses for body-mind-spirit healing. You may feel nurtured, balanced and energized. A Healing Touch session can be given anywhere, from a chair in a client's home to the bed in a hospital room. The session is typically administered while the client lies on a treatment table or bed with clothes on. The practitioner uses her/his hands to assess your energy system. S/he proceeds to clear and balance your energy system as needed using either off body touch (near but no direct contact) or a gentle (still) touch over various areas of the body. An average session may last anywhere from 15 to 60 minutes, based on the client's needs, the methods being used, setting and available time. How does energy healing work? Energy therapies focus on removing energy congestion that forms in our energy fields (aura) and energy centers (chakras). It re-establishes healthy energy flow through opening, connecting and balancing the human energy system. The goal of Healing Touch is to restore harmony and balance in the human energy system thus creating an optimal environment for the body's innate tendency for healing to occur. \u00a92019 Healing Touch Program Inc.
