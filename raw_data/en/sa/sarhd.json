Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is even more important nowadays to keep the immune system strong. The immune system works around the clock to ensure that your entire body is protected, and there are things you can do to help it perform its function well. The most common way to strengthen the immune system is by eating healthy and maintaining an active lifestyle. You have to make sure that you get all the necessary vitamins and minerals through food and supplements. However, there are other ways to support your immune system, such as practicing good hygiene. There is another often untapped way to [support your immune system naturally](https://organicaromas.com/blogs/aromatherapy-and-essential-oils/why-choose-aromatherapy-as-a-natural-medicine): aromatherapy. Essential oils are packed with various benefits that can be harnessed to improve health. Which Essential Oils To Use And How To Use Them The best essential oils to use for the purpose of strengthening the immune system are those with antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antifungal, and antiseptic properties. Each essential oil has its own way of helping your immune system\u2014some directly stimulate the immune system while others may help indirectly by promoting overall well-being. All of these are important because the immune system is affected by every aspect of the body. One more thing to keep in mind is that while these essential oils offer valuable health benefits, those benefits can be subdued by improper diffusing techniques. Diffusing with heat or water (or both) has negative effects on essential oils. Those elements can dilute the benefits offered by essential oils. On the other hand, a [nebulizing diffuser](https://organicaromas.com/products/essential-oil-diffuser-aromatherapy-radiance) is ideal for delivering the full benefits of essential oils. This type of diffuser is more efficient than others on the market. A nebulizing diffuser uses pressurized air to turn essential oil into microparticles, which are then dispersed into the air. This method keeps the composition of essential oils intact. It is also capable of dispersing these microparticles throughout a large area in a small amount of time, so you can make sure that everyone in the family will benefit from the diffuser blends you use.
