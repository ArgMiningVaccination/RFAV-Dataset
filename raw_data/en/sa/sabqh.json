You should also speak to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you would like further information or if you have any concerns or questions about receiving INFLUVAC TETRA. Where to find information in this leaflet: [1. Why am I receiving INFLUVAC TETRA?](#s1) [2. What should I know before I receive INFLUVAC TETRA?](#s2) [3. What if I am How is INFLUVAC TETRA given?](#s4) know after [6. Are there any side effects?](#s6) [7. Why am I receiving INFLUVAC INFLUVAC TETRA is a quadrivalent influenza vaccine containing inactivated fragments from four types of influenza virus. INFLUVAC TETRA is used to prevent certain types of influenza (commonly called the flu). The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against four different types of influenza virus. Each year new types of influenza virus can appear, so every year INFLUVAC TETRA is changed to contain fragments of the new types of virus. Therefore, influenza vaccination is recommended every year. Please note that INFLUVAC TETRA will only protect you against the four types of influenza virus used to make the vaccine. It will not protect you from influenza caused by other types of influenza virus or from infections with other agents causing flu-like symptoms (such as the common cold). INFLUVAC TETRA can be used in adults and children over the age of 6 months. 2. What should I know before I receive INFLUVAC TETRA? Warnings Do not receive INFLUVAC TETRA if: - You are allergic to any influenza vaccine or any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet. Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue. - You currently have a severe infection or fever. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist about this before being vaccinated. Check with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if: - You have received INFLUVAC TETRA before and became unwell. - You have ever had an illness affecting the nervous system, especially Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS). If you have had GBS, you may be more likely to develop GBS following influenza vaccination than someone who has never had GBS. - You have any medical conditions, such as an immune deficiency condition, thrombocytopenia, coagulation disorder or bleeding disorder. - You have ever fainted or fallen or felt faint just before or after receiving an injection. Pregnancy and breastfeeding Check with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. They will discuss with you the benefits and risks of receiving INFLUVAC TETRA when pregnant. Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are breast feeding. They will discuss the risks and benefits of vaccination however the vaccine is not expected to cause problems for breast-fed babies. Storage INFLUVAC TETRA is usually stored at the pharmacy, at the doctor's surgery or at the flu vaccination clinic. If you need to store INFLUVAC TETRA, always: - Keep it in the refrigerator stored between 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C. Do not freeze as freezing destroys the vaccine. - Keep it where young children cannot reach it. - Keep it in the original pack until it is time for it to be given. Ask your pharmacist what to do with any leftover INFLUVAC TETRA that has expired or has not been used. 3. What if I am taking other medicines? Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you have received another vaccine this year or if you are taking any other medicines, including any that you buy without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop. 4. How is INFLUVAC TETRA given? How it is given The doctor, nurse or pharmacist will give INFLUVAC TETRA as an injection. For some people with bleeding problems, the injection may need to be given under the skin (subcutaneously). INFLUVAC TETRA should never be given into a vein (intravenously). How much is given For adults and children over 6 months of age, the doctor, nurse or pharmacist will give a single 0.5 mL dose of INFLUVAC TETRA. For children less than 9 years of age who have not previously been vaccinated, a second dose of 0.5 mL should be given after an interval of at least 4 weeks. When it is given INFLUVAC TETRA is generally given as a single dose in autumn each year before the start of the flu season. You should receive a repeated vaccination every year as new types of influenza virus can appear each year. If the dose is missed Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist and arrange another visit as soon as possible. 5. What should I know after receiving INFLUVAC TETRA? As with any vaccine, a protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccines. Driving or using machines Be careful before you drive or use any machines or tools until you know how INFLUVAC TETRA affects you. INFLUVAC TETRA should not normally interfere with your ability to drive a car or operate machinery. But in some people vaccination can cause dizziness or light-headedness. Make sure you know how you react to INFLUVAC TETRA before you drive a car, operate machinery, or do anything that could be dangerous if you are dizzy or light-headed. 6. Are there any side effects? Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist as soon as possible if you do not feel well during or after receiving a dose of INFLUVAC TETRA. All medicines can have side effects. Most unwanted effects with INFLUVAC TETRA are mild and usually clear up within a few days. These effects, as with other vaccines, generally occur around the injection site. However, some side effects may need medical attention. As with all vaccines given by injection there is a very small risk of serious reactions. Allergy to INFLUVAC TETRA is rare. Any such severe reactions will usually occur within the first few hours of vaccination. Ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you have any questions about side effects.
