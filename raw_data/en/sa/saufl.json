From having kadha every day to including several herbs and spices in our diet, we all are relying on Ayurvedic remedies to boost our immunity. Ayurveda can improve our health in ways more than one. In this article, we will talk about how age-old Ayurvedic rituals can be beneficial for your baby. The birth of a baby is the watershed moment that changes the course of our lives. Along with the celebration, all the focus is on giving the best care to the newborn. It is also equally important to take care of the new mom who is experiencing all this for the first time. She too needs attention and care from the people around her. Here is a list of customs and traditions that are age-old and highly trusted. These lifestyle recommendations were an important part of the earlier Ayurvedic lifestyle. However, we would like to make it clear that these are not a substitute for medical advice.

Make sure not to jerk the baby when he is sleeping or be very loud while sitting near him. Sometimes, the common playful gesture of tossing a baby in the air can create fear in the baby's mind, thus it must be avoided. Play gentle music or sing lullabies till the baby is one year old and do not leave the baby unattended. Harsh and loud words should be avoided in front of the baby.

This was done to prevent people from touching the baby and reducing the risk of infection. Baby's immunity is not developed until the third or fourth month and that is why taking this step is deemed necessary.

Ayurveda recommends using ashwagandha, shalparni, the root of the castor plant, castor oil, sesame oil, turmeric and goat milk for massaging the baby. Ashwagandha in sesame oil or mustard oil used to be applied to the baby in the reverse direction, which was called udhwartana.

For this, the baby's room was fumigated with ayurvedic resins and leaves to counter negative energies and infuse positivity in the room. Brahmi, heeng, gugulu and jatamansi can be used to fumigate a baby's room and clothes. This also helps by neutralising the germs in the air.

The access should be limited for this room. Traditionally the day the baby completes his fourth month, he is bathed, made to wear new clothes and brought out of the nursery. The elders of the house bless the baby and once this is done, the baby is taken to other rooms of the house.

The baby is kept inside the room for four months with only one exception where the baby is shown the morning sunlight for a few minutes. This sometimes can also be done while staying in the room, if there is a window from where the morning sunlight comes in. Similarly, the moonlight is also beneficial for the baby nervous system and helps in balancing the gynaecological cycle of the mother.
