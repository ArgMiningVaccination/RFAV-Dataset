Native concepts of wellbeing are highlighted and linked to the idea of living in \"balance\".", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2014-10-20", "cleaned_text": "Walking in Balance: Native American Recovery had previously researched the use of pan-Native American ritual practices among the Mi'kmaq of Canada for overcoming trauma, which also highlighted the importance of community for individual healing [ [3](#B3-religions-05-01037)]. It is of little surprise that the types of practices employed in alcohol recovery programmes are also ones that are considered pan-Native American. As a consequence, treatment programmes may be fuelling their popular use more widely. [1](#fn1-religions-05-01037)I will end with an examination of a common Native American concept of wellbeing, which is connected to the idea of living in \"balance\", emerging from discourses within the context of recovery from addiction. [4](#B4-religions-05-01037)], p. 254). These cultural arguments are frequently stated by clients and staff at treatment centres, as Manitowabi and Shawande discovered: \"In research interviews conducted, many made reference to colonial intrusions such as residential schools, Christianity, and social and economic displacement leading to a disruption in Anishinabe wellbeing.\" ([ [5](#B5-religions-05-01037)], p. 452, using a variant spelling of Anishinaabe). Likewise, anthropologist Erica Prussing observed that on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation in Montana, \"many who use [the Twelve Step rhetoric] also explicitly address colonialism as a cause of drinking\" ([ [6](#B6-religions-05-01037)], p. 3). Clinical psychologist Joseph Gone also discussed the impact and legacy of colonisation on Native peoples more generally in his 2011 article \"The Red Road to Wellness\" ([ [7](#B7-religions-05-01037)], p. 187). However, Waldram, Herring and Young say there is a danger in trying to show that the loss of traditional methods of coping and a sense of powerlessness led to a reliance on alcohol as this emphasises the \"Aboriginal as victim\" ([ [4](#B4-religions-05-01037)], p. 267). The choice to employ traditional ceremonies and frameworks may then be part of a wider decolonizing effort to overcome cultural traumas and reclaim Native American traditions and identities. 2. Native American Ritual Practices [1](#B1-religions-05-01037)], p. 82; [ [8](#B8-religions-05-01037)]). The treatment centres discussed in this article have these components and equip individuals with tools and frameworks for continued use after completing the programmes, hence the reason why some of the clients in turn become healers or teachers. This appears to have been a positive by-product from the beginning. According to French: \"An early success using a variation of this native treatment model was established at the Nebraska Penal Complex in the mid-1970s as a reaction to the incarceration of American Indian Movement warriors.\" ([ [1](#B1-religions-05-01037)], p. 92). Sweat lodges and other services were provided by the Native American Spiritual and Cultural Awareness (NASCA) association. \"Those who were initiated to these traditional customs while incarcerated at the Nebraska Penal Complex later became traditional healers among their people at the tribal level and within the urban Indian centers.\" ([ [1](#B1-religions-05-01037)], pp. 93-94). This would suggest that many of the contemporary Native healers are themselves in recovery. [2](#B2-religions-05-01037)], p. 87), which is also the period that saw a resurgence of interest in Native American practices among supporters of the American Indian Movement and other counter-cultural groups, such as those objecting to the Vietnam War. Black Elk Speaks, the story of the Lakota holy man originally published in 1932, was reissued in 1972 and became a \"bible\" for Native Americans wanting to reconnect with their \"roots\" ([ [9](#B9-religions-05-01037)], p. xv), even if they were not Lakota. Also in 1972, leaders of the American Indian Movement turned to the Lakota on Pine Ridge reservation for spiritual guidance from holy men such as Black Elk's nephew, Frank Fools Crow ([ [10](#B10-religions-05-01037)], p. 36). Thus, Lakota cultural practices were shared and popularised among many tribal nations (and beyond) and provided a model for pan-Native American ritual practices employed in recovery programmes. It must be remembered that this was before the 1978 American Indian Religious Freedom Act. As French noted: \"The Sioux [Lakota] traditions of the sacred pipe, purification sweat, vision quest, and the Sun Dance, all once outlawed and their practitioners severely punished, have emerged as treatment and training processes for native healers among both the Plains Indians and pan-Indians\" ([ [1](#B1-religions-05-01037)], p. 92). [2](#B2-religions-05-01037)], p. 82). In a talking circle, a person can speak when he or she is holding a designated object (often an eagle feather, or a carved stick on its own) that is passed around the circle. Usually there is no requirement to speak and one can pass the object on to the next person. It is a method that is quite wide-spread, also within non-Native groups, and may simply be referred to as a \"sharing circle\". [7](#B7-religions-05-01037)], p. 194). As an example, Gone says that at the Healing Lodge in Canada where he conducted his research the medicine wheel's four quadrants were linked to four aspects of human experience, the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual. The therapeutic project, then, \"was to promote client awareness of all four aspects of the self and to facilitate the pursuit of balance among these facets of experience through healthier lifestyle choices\" ([ [7](#B7-religions-05-01037)], p. 194). As it provides a structure for looking at different areas of life, the medicine wheel is easily adapted to substance abuse treatment programmes. \"As a consequence, even the western approaches were structured within an overtly Aboriginal frame of reference.\" ([ [7](#B7-religions-05-01037)], p. 195), especially the notion of the \"self\" as a project to be developed in the four areas of life represented by the four quadrants of the medicine wheel. [11](#B11-religions-05-01037)], p. 48), referring here to the four aspects of human experience noted by Gone above, stated frequently in Native American healing discourses. 3. Native American-Led Recovery Programmes: Examples [2](#B2-religions-05-01037)], p. 90). The centre uses the three common ritual practices already described: the talking circle, medicine wheel and sweat lodge. According to Ringwald, members of fifty-four different tribes had attended Indian Rehab during a three month period in 1997 and said facilitators had allowed for cultural variations, but had described the talking circle as \"pan-Indian\". However, some tribes did not allow women to hold an eagle feather used to pass around the circle ([ [2](#B2-religions-05-01037)], p. 91). One counsellor told Ringwald that: \"The use of these methods does not harken back to ancient times so much as it represents modern adaptation. Powwows arose among tribes elsewhere in the country, sweat lodges were imported from the Lakota, and talking circles are a relatively new thing\" ([ [2](#B2-religions-05-01037)], p. 92). Many of these have become standardised in treatment programmes so that staff from different backgrounds can offer them and clients can find similar cultural features at other centres. These also feature in many inter-tribal gatherings, such as powwows. However, there is room for more tribal-specific content and Ringwald gives an example of an Alcoholics Anonymous group in Minnesota where residents \"learned to drum and chanted Ojibwe songs from a tribal elder\" ([ [2](#B2-religions-05-01037)], p. 84), as well as participate in sweat lodge ceremonies. \"Rather than being strictly tribal or sectarian, the rites and rituals are portable and adaptable, say practitioners. 'When I go to a Sioux sweat lodge, they ask me to call to my own Ojibwe ancestors'\", one said to Ringwald ([ [2](#B2-religions-05-01037)], p. 89). [7](#B7-religions-05-01037)], pp. 188-89). Of the clients he interviewed, only two had direct experience of residential schooling while the others had relatives who experienced it ([ [7](#B7-religions-05-01037)], p. 189). The programme included lectures on residential schooling and an associated fieldtrip to a former residential school ([ [7](#B7-religions-05-01037)], p. 191). [7](#B7-religions-05-01037)], p. 191). One client said: \"This is where I started my healing journey. And this is where I practiced my Native culture. I go to sweat [lodge ceremonie]s, I go to fasting [camp]s, I go to powwows, and participate. It's a good feeling when you're starting to find your identity. To have that sense of belonging...and to have that identity in the purpose of life.\" ([ [7](#B7-religions-05-01037)], p. 192). The main Aboriginal approaches employed at the Healing Lodge included \"prayer and 'smudging' (i.e., purifying oneself by burning sacred plants), talking circles, tobacco offerings, pipe ceremonies, sweat lodge rituals, fasting camps, and various other blessing rites (e.g., ritual renewal of the colored cloths that marked the directional entrances to the Lodge)\" ([ [7](#B7-religions-05-01037)], p. 192). The prayers would include Christian ones as well as Native ones for giving thanks. As for the lectures, Gone noted that \"topics included a combination of both Aboriginal cultural orientation (e.g., seven sacred directions (i.e., a medicine wheel, community values, residential schools) and mainstream 'life skills' instruction (e.g., alcohol and drugs, self-esteem, communication skills)\" ([ [7](#B7-religions-05-01037)], p. 191). Additionally, the Healing Lodge made an effort to serve locals: \"program counsellors were involved in sponsoring cultural activities for the community (e.g., a pipe ceremony in honor of residential school survivors)\" ([ [7](#B7-religions-05-01037)], p. 193). Ceremonial leaders were also prominent: [The Healing] Lodge employed a full-time \"traditional counselor\" whose responsibilities included the formulation and facilitation of additional cultural activities within standard treatment regimens. For example, the traditional counselor conducted a sweat lodge ceremony every Thursday afternoon for clients. Finally, nine of the staff at the Lodge\u2014including the majority of the counseling program staff\u2014identified as \"pipe carriers\", which means that they had obtained the right and responsibility to ritually care for and pray with a sacred pipe. As a result, client encounters with Aboriginal culture and tradition\u2014even though full participation was strictly optional\u2014were routine. Some clients had never participated in these activities prior to their time in the program.([ [7]], p. 193) [12](#B12-religions-05-01037)], pp. 30-31). Like the Healing Lodge, Poundmaker's emphasises cultural education in treating substance abuse and incorporates a number of pan-Native American ceremonies. Waldram, Herring and Young say that \"all patients are required to attend sweetgrass ceremonies morning and evening...\" ([ [4](#B4-religions-05-01037)], p. 254). From my experience, this would involve \"smudging\" where the smoke from the burning sweetgrass is either fanned out, using a feather, in the direction of each individual or each person scoops the smoke over themselves as the sweetgrass is taken around the circle. Leaders might say that it transforms negative energy into positive; certainly participants usually feel uplifted by it. In the circle, they allow \"time to pray in their own way and in their own language, and time is made available for them to talk, in turn, about what may be on their mind\" ([ [4](#B4-religions-05-01037)], pp. 254-55). There is no overt pressure to talk and ceremonies such as the sweat lodge are offered but not mandatory ([ [4](#B4-religions-05-01037)], p. 255). Nabigon also mentioned being taken to a sweat lodge there ([ [12](#B12-religions-05-01037)], p. 31). The Elders taught him \"the Hub\", described as a Cree conception of the self, interwoven with the medicine wheel, that includes \"the four stages of life: infancy, youth, adulthood and the Elder years\" ([ [12](#B12-religions-05-01037)], pp. 43, 116), which is of course not uniquely Cree. [12](#B12-religions-05-01037)], p. 115); here I follow Nabigon's example in capitalising the word Elder to show that it signifies a particular status), which would come from years of observation and experience of the world. At Poundmaker's Lodge in Alberta, \"Elders, who may or may not be healers, are invariably involved in the programming.\" ([ [4](#B4-religions-05-01037)], p. 255). One Cree Elder said to Waldram that \"he sought to help patients reconnect with whatever Aboriginal culture they were from.\" ([ [4](#B4-religions-05-01037)], p. 255). In The Hollow Tree that one of the Elders at Poundmaker's Lodge suggested to Nabigon that he do a four-day fast to begin his \"sacred journey\". \"Fasting and ancient teachings from the Elders helped me set aside the alcohol and pick up and carry my sacred pipe.\" ([ [12](#B12-religions-05-01037)], pp. 33-34). [13](#B13-religions-05-01037)]. This type of philosophy is put into practice at the Healing Lodge on an Algonquian First Nations reserve in Canada. Gone was told that \"program staff also hosted cultural activities for the community, including powwow dances, pipe ceremonies, and an annual fasting camp. Although clients were always encouraged to participate, staff strove to engage community members at large in these activities as part of a collective healing process\", adding that confidentiality about being on the programme was not an issue for clients as it was not easy to keep it a secret anyway in such a close-knit community ([ [7](#B7-religions-05-01037)], p. 192). 4. Native Adaptations to Twelve Step [4](#B4-religions-05-01037)], p. 269). This is reflected in White Bison, which facilitates the Wellbriety Movement for addition recovery and provides the Warrior Down support programme based on Twelve Step and the medicine wheel to help veterans and people returning from prisons. In their Wellbriety Treatment Center Certification Criteria for certifying programmes using their materials, it includes: \"Have relationship and ready access to at least one Native American Elder (ideally a male and a female) for advice and to conduct ceremonies\" and \"Ensure that Native traditional healing practices are incorporated into treatment programs (smudging, pipe ceremony, sweat lodge, naming ceremony, healing ceremony, as appropriate for the individuals cultural needs)\" [ [14](#B14-religions-05-01037)]. The institute provides a curriculum, DVDs and other resources to enable centres to provide a full programme. [1](#B1-religions-05-01037)], p. 90; [ [2](#B2-religions-05-01037)], p. 101; [ [4](#B4-religions-05-01037)], p. 255). At the Healing Lodge, an administrator referred to Twelve Step as a \"spiritual\" programme, which is likely the reason it is attractive to those adapting it for Native American treatment programmes. In Joseph Gone's observation, Twelve Step is not the only western-derived model he found there; he also observed influences \"from popular psychology and alternative or New Age medicine: inner child explorations, guided imagery, meditation and visualization, anger discharge, acupuncture, neurolinguistic programming, genogram mapping, reiki, energy work, and cosmo therapy\" ([ [7](#B7-religions-05-01037)], p. 192). [1](#B1-religions-05-01037)], p. 89). French describes the standard version of Alcoholics Anonymous as \"rooted in the protestant ethic\", while the \"values of harmony ethos\", emphasising group cooperation and respect for nature, are attributed to Native American cultures ([ [1](#B1-religions-05-01037)], pp. 4, 89). As an example, with French uncritically mirroring the essentialisms found in the treatment programmes themselves, he contrasts the standard \"Critical attitude\" with the Native values\" ([ [1](#B1-religions-05-01037)], p. 89). The wording of the Steps has been changed to reflect these values. Where Step 11 in the standard AA version states: \"Seek through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God, as we understand him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out\", in the Native American version, according to French, it states (my emphasis, to show alteration): \"Seek through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with the Equality and Brotherhood of all Mother Earth's children and the Great Balancing Harmony of the Total Universe.\" ([ [1](#B1-religions-05-01037)], p. 90). Balance and harmony are often stated values, discussed below. [2](#B2-religions-05-01037)], p. 101). At a centre in Minnesota, women and men are at the drum when traditionally women sing behind the men at the drum ([ [2](#B2-religions-05-01037)], p. 102). This can be observed at powwows, where Plains Indian-derived protocols for drumming and other aspects, such as the wearing of eagle feathers, are modelled (see [ [15](#B15-religions-05-01037)]). 5. Controversies [7](#B7-religions-05-01037)], p. 187). Not only are these Native-derived practices absorbing the language and values of \"therapy culture\", he also observed that counsellors \"selfconsciously engaged in the incorporation of Aboriginal approaches and practices into their more conventional treatment efforts, effectively institutionalizing several of these\" ([ [7](#B7-religions-05-01037)], p. 193). He does not indicate the impact of this on healing practices outside treatment programmes, but this is likely to be considerable if some of those who complete the programmes go on to become healers in the wider community. This is an area that needs further study. [6](#B6-religions-05-01037)], p. 3). She says these efforts have gained both support and criticism in the local community. Using Twelve Step itself is problematic for a few because the vocabulary and concepts alienates some people ([ [6](#B6-religions-05-01037)], p. 7). As noted by French above, Prussing implies that Alcoholics Anonymous' Protestant values are at odds with Cheyenne values: A.A.'s distinctly Anglo-American flavor is evident in how Twelve Step concepts and practices are firmly grounded within broader Protestant traditions, including an emphasis on self-control, themes of conversion and surrender, and the central role of personal testimony, and through being voluntary and individual (rather than coerced by hierarchical authority).... Arguably, Twelve Step approaches also reflect a broader contemporary American cultural tendency to define spirituality in psychological terms....([ [6]], p. 16) [7](#B7-religions-05-01037)], p. 195). Since the a \"therapeutic project\", \"'working on' oneself, one's 'issues', or one's life was emblematic of the healing journey that signified a lifelong process of introspection, transformation, and fulfillment\" ([ [7](#B7-religions-05-01037)], p. 196; \"healing discourse\" is evident throughout Herb Nabigon's The Hollow Tree). Confirming Laurence French's view that Native Americans value silence over verbalism, Gone heard that at the Healing Lodge it was often challenging to get clients to talk, and \"the difficulties associated with eliciting therapeutic talk from clients was attributed in part to enduring community norms that devalued or proscribed such verbal self-expression\" ([ [7](#B7-religions-05-01037)], p. 196). Thus, \"in contrast to the self-consciously selected and rhetorically effective celebration of recognizable Aboriginal symbols and practices at the Lodge, healing discourse among staff and clients was also seen to depend heavily (but implicitly) on more familiar aspects of mainstream 'therapy culture'\" ([ [7](#B7-religions-05-01037)], p. 197). In other words, Native American practices have been subverted to suit the therapy agenda derived from non-Native sources such as Twelve Step. Treatment programmes, in effect, are engaged in a universalising commodification and appropriation of Native American cultural practices. [7](#B7-religions-05-01037)], pp. 191, 195). Bridging the practice of storytelling with narrating the personal journey through addiction and recovery is one way of bridging 12 Step and Native American traditions. [10](#B10-religions-05-01037)]). Ringwald explains that: \"Within Indian treatment circles, there are some tensions regarding the proper role of traditional healing and spirituality, paying for such services, and the potential for misuse.\" ([ [2](#B2-religions-05-01037)], p. 99). There is a problem that many \"medicine men\" do not want to be paid for their services if they hold to traditional values ([ [2](#B2-religions-05-01037)], p. 100). It is possible to give monetary or other material gifts afterward in a show of appreciation to elders and healers. There is a subtle difference. Paying for services brings an expectation that a healing or teaching will be performed, taking away the power from the healer or Elder to not perform, if the situation makes it difficult (such as attitudes of organisers or participants). [2](#B2-religions-05-01037)], p. 101). They would not easily recognise how a cultural practice has been modified; however, all such practices have undergone continuous change and are adapted to each circumstance. \"Will practicing ceremonies outside their original context or locale lead to misuse or even mutation?\" asks Ringwald ([ [2](#B2-religions-05-01037)], p. 102). In answer, I would say there are only \"mutations\" if one accepts that there are \"pure\" practices, but that is not possible. However, the debate over perceived misuse is more complex and connected to issues of appropriation more widely (see [ [10](#B10-religions-05-01037)]). For those undergoing treatment, there are more pragmatic concerns for \"whatever works\". 6. Balance and Wellbeing This book is destined to shine as an example of the power of our Elders to use their spiritual gifts to turn their people away from unbalanced life ways and self-destructive feelings such as hate, resentment, inferiority, and jealousy towards a life guided by kindness, honesty, courage, and humility.([ [16]], pp. ix-x) In the twenty-five years of friendship that we share, I have seen my \"Neechee\" Herb Nabigon walk away from the doom of alcohol, hurt, and despair to the place of high respectability, personal balance, and collective hope....([ [16]], p. xi) [12](#B12-religions-05-01037)], p. xvii). The tool he uses \"on a daily basis\" is a Cree version of the medicine wheel \"to maintain balance in my life\", which is represented by the eagle feather ([ [12](#B12-religions-05-01037)], p. 43). An aspect of the Plains Indian medicine wheel teaching picked up by those in recovery is the \"red road\". The wheel has within it a cross representing the two axes, the black and the red. The black \"road\" is thought to represent difficulties and imbalance, at least in therapy discourses (it also has an association with power), while the red represents growth and balance. As Herb Nabigon learned at Poundmaker's Lodge: \"The people who walk the red road attempt to balance their lives between goodness and fear\" ([ [12](#B12-religions-05-01037)], p. 47). Fasting also helped and, referring to his first fast, he said it \"was my first attempt to balance my life; to balance my life like Nature balances itself through the four changing seasons\" ([ [12](#B12-religions-05-01037)], p. 77). [5](#B5-religions-05-01037)], p. 443; [ [17](#B17-religions-05-01037)], p. 44). In Hallowell's highly regarded study of Ojibwe (or Anishinaabe) ontology, he relates the conception of \"wellbeing\" to having \"balance\" involving reciprocal relationships with others, including non-human persons (animals, stones, etc.). \"One of the prime values of Ojibwe culture is exemplified by the great stress laid upon sharing what one has with others. A balance, a sense of proportion must be maintained in all interpersonal relations and activities.\" ([ [7](#B7-religions-05-01037)], pp. 45-46). [5](#B5-religions-05-01037)], p. 449). This quote also suggests that the self is a project needing development, highlighted by Joseph Gone ([ [7](#B7-religions-05-01037)], pp. 194-96). Manitowabi and Shawande do add that \"balance\" was another of the recurring key words expressed by participants ([ [5](#B5-religions-05-01037)], p. 452): \"Interviewees spoke about balance as key to wellbeing and healing, and the need to nurture one's body spirit... Clients stated that healing is tied to balance which suggests that imbalance is linked to a state of unhealthiness\" ([ [5](#B5-religions-05-01037)], pp. 453-54). In summary, they state that: \"In essence, wellbeing means a balanced way of life. If an imbalance occurs one must return to a state of equilibrium leading to a long healthy life.\" ([ [5](#B5-religions-05-01037)], p. 454). [18](#B18-religions-05-01037)], p. 144). He quotes Joan Feather, who says: The Native concept of health...is said to be holistic because it integrates and gives equal emphasis to the physical, spiritual, mental and emotional aspects of the person. The circle is used to represent the inseparability of the individual, family, community and world...The circle (or wheel) embodies the notion of health as harmony or balance in all aspects of one's life. [20](#B20-religions-05-01037)], p. 145). \"Harmony\", like \"holism\" and \"balance\", also occurs frequently in discourse about health and wellbeing. In another example, Long, David and Fox say \"for Native people, health implies being in harmony with all of creation\" ([ [21](#B21-religions-05-01037)], p. 241). 7. Conclusions [3](#B3-religions-05-01037)]. Another area for future research that arises from this study is the discourse on colonization and the use of Native American practices and frameworks as a decolonization practice.
