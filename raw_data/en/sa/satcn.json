LaFerla, Dean 5120 Natural Sciences II http://www.bio.uci.edu/ This is the ideal time to be studying biology. We are solving problems today whose solutions were unimaginable even a few years ago, and implications for our society, our health, and our environment are profound. The School of Biological Sciences is dedicated to providing students with a unique course of study that fosters a deep appreciation for the exciting facts and concepts in the field, an education that allows graduates to excel in their chosen careers. The School has recently redesigned the curriculum to remain on the cutting edge of biological education. All first-year students are introduced to basic concepts in ecology and evolutionary biology, as well as cellular and molecular biology. The core set of courses in biology continues into the second year, featuring genetics, biochemistry, and molecular biology, followed in the third and fourth year by a choice of advanced courses in biology. Since biology is a laboratory discipline, students complete a series of laboratory courses in which they learn both the techniques and approaches needed to solve problems in biology. Finally, the faculty expect that most students will engage in cutting-edge research in one of more than 250 laboratories and medical clinics in the School of Biological Sciences and the UCI School of Medicine. It is in these situations that faculty train students to think in a sophisticated way about real- world problems. There is also no feeling of excitement greater than finding out something about the world that no one has ever known before, a feeling afforded in biology only by participation in research. The Excellence in Research Program allows students to present their work and be recognized for their performance with a series of awards and publication of their reports in the School's online Journal of Undergraduate Research. The set of core classes that instructs students in the concepts of biology, the advanced classes that allow a deep understanding of specialized aspects of biology, the laboratory courses that convey the practical aspects of problem-solving in biology, and the research experiences that engage students in the real excitement in revealing new information about biology, come together to provide an extraordinary experience for students. The Honors Program in the School of Biological Sciences further enhances the educational experience for the best students. Biology students with a broad interest in the area can opt to complete a major in Biological Sciences. Additionally, they have the option of specializing in areas of biology that best fit their interests, completing courses for degree programs in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biology/Education, Developmental and Cell Biology, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Exercise Sciences, Genetics, Human Biology, Microbiology and Immunology, or Neurobiology. Completion of any of these majors forms an excellent basis for application to either graduate or professional studies such as medical school, and graduates of the School of Biological Sciences are routinely accepted to the most prestigious programs in the country. The quality of the faculty in the School of Biological Sciences has remained high while increasing steadily in number over the past few years, giving students a remarkable range of expertise in biology and with it, a large number of different advanced courses and research opportunities. In addition, their efforts have brought several high-impact research units to the campus, such as the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, the Center for Virus Research, the Beckman Laser Institute, the Cancer Research Institute, the Developmental Biology Center, the Center for Immunology, the Institute for Memory Impairments and Neurological Disorders, the Macromolecular Structure Research Unit, the Organized Research Unit in Molecular and Mitochondrial Medicine and Genetics, the Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics, the Center for Complex Biological Systems, and the Reeve-Irvine Research Center, all of which are accessible to undergraduates. The School of Biological Sciences also has close research and teaching collaborations with faculty in the Schools of Medicine, Physical Sciences, Social Ecology, and Social Sciences; the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences; and The Henry Samueli School of Engineering. UCI General Catalogue 2023-242 School of Biological Sciences In addition to the regular University requirements for admission, students interested in the biological sciences should include in their high school curriculum, in addition to a course in biology, four years of mathematics, as well as courses in chemistry and physics, which are now an integral part of most contemporary biological work. The School's professional counseling staff is always available for consultation to students regarding the many decisions in their academic program. They also are trained to provide guidance in the application process to both professional and graduate schools, a real advantage to the high proportion of students in the School of Biological Sciences who go on to pursue advanced degrees. Opportunities are available at the graduate level to specialize in Developmental and Cell Biology, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, and Neurobiology and Behavior.

Graduate Program in Cellular and Molecular Biosciences Peter J. Donovan, Director Administrative Contact Information: Gary Roman 4145 Natural Sciences II 949-824-6226 UCI General Catalogue 2023-246 School of Biological Sciences http://cmb.uci.edu The combined graduate program in Cellular and Molecular Biosciences (CMB) provides the first year of instruction for graduate students entering Ph.D. programs in six departments within the School of Biological Sciences and the School of Medicine. Applicants should have significant laboratory experience and be well prepared in biochemistry, molecular biology, cell biology, and genetics with appropriate course work in organic chemistry, calculus, and physics. Requirements During the first year, students will select one of five focus areas: \"Immunology and Microbiology,\" Cancer and Cell Biology,\" \"Genetics, Epigenetics and Genomics.\" Students will select three didactic courses, one each quarter, from a menu of course options recommended for their focus area. Students with more general interests will be allowed to substitute courses to gain knowledge in different areas of biomedical science. Furthermore, any student may switch focus areas during the first year. Changes to course work or Focus Area can be achieved by simple petition to the CMB director. During the first year the students also complete three required 2-unit S/U courses (Ph.D. Fundamentals, Biomedical Research Methods, and Responsible Conduct of Research) that develop knowledge and skills not necessarily covered in the didactic courses. Students may take additional elective courses relevant to their area of specialization although this is not encouraged. Each Focus Area recommends elective courses for students in years two or later, to be taken after transfer to a departmental Ph.D. program. The students also undertake introductory research in at least two laboratories during their first year. Students can select a laboratory rotation from over 100 faculty laboratories in the departments of Biological Chemistry, Developmental and Cell Biology, Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and Physiology and Biophysics. Each faculty member's area of research is described on the department websites. Faculty also are associated with research areas that span departments, as shown on the CMB website (http://cmb.uci.edu ). The year culminates in a comprehensive preliminary examination and evaluation. At the end of the first academic year, students will select a thesis advisor in one of the departments. Students who select a thesis advisor in the School of Biological Sciences (Department of Developmental and Cell Biology or Molecular Biology and Biochemistry) will complete the doctoral degree in Biological Sciences. Students who select a thesis advisor in the School of Medicine (Departments of Biological Chemistry, Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and Physiology and Biophysics) will complete the doctoral degree in Biomedical Sciences. During the second year and beyond, students participate in the departmental doctoral program. Students are required to meet all doctoral degree requirements associated with the thesis advisor's department or program, and may be required to take additional course work, and participate in journal club and seminar series. The normative time for completion of the Ph.D. is five years, and the maximum time permitted is seven years. Further information is available in the Catalogue sections of the participating departments and through the CMB program office. Graduate Program in Mathematical, Computational, and Systems Biology The graduate program in Mathematical, Computational, and Systems Biology (MCSB) is designed to meet the interdisciplinary training challenges of modern biology and to function in concert with existing departmental programs or as an individually tailored program leading to an M.S. or Ph.D. Detailed information is available at the Mathematical, Computational, and Systems Biology website (http://mcsb.uci.edu/ ) and in the the Catalogue . Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program is a first-year graduate program that brings together more than 90 faculty from the School of Biological Sciences and the School of Medicine, including participation from the Departments of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Developmental and Cell Biology, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Neurobiology and Behavior, Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and Physiology and Biophysics. INP faculty have broad research interests in behavioral neuroscience, brain aging, developmental neurobiology, genetics, learning and memory, molecular neuropharmacology, plasticity, and sensory neuroscience. Neuroscience as a discipline requires scientists to have a detailed understanding of at least one field, and a broad understanding of many other fields. INP provides breadth early on, followed by specialization across the remainder of the predoctoral training years. The normative time for degree completion is five years. INP organizes and coordinates a core curriculum that provides a foundation in neuroscience and forms the basis of future specialized instruction in a participating departmental degree-granting program. This curriculum includes course work and laboratory rotations. Each trainee is individually mentored in tailoring an appropriate course of study based on academic background, interests, and research foci. After successfully completing the academic requirements of the program, students identify a thesis advisor who is willing to accept them into their laboratory, and the student will transfer to the doctoral program in their advisor's home department. In this way, INP serves not as a degree-granting program, but as a gateway to further graduate training. Students are required to meet all doctoral degree requirements associated with the thesis advisor's department or program. UCI General Catalogue 2023-24School of Biological Sciences 7 In particular, the program provides trainees with an opportunity: (1) to begin training in neuroscience with a broad academic introduction, (2) to receive individualized attention to curricular needs, (3) to conduct initial research projects with a large and diverse group of faculty in a wide variety of departments, and (4) to conduct dissertation research in any of a large and diverse group of laboratories in a wide variety of departments. Requirements In the first year of study, students must successfully complete one course from each of the molecular, systems, and cellular neuroscience categories. All trainees also participate in a two-unit course Foundations of Neuroscience ( NEURBIO 202A -NEURBIO 202B ). This mandatory course is intended to expose students to research in neuroscience and critical reading and analysis of the primary literature. Students are encouraged to carry out three laboratory rotations of 10 weeks each. With permission from the director and the dean, students may carry out fewer rotations. Rotations are graded on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory Only scale. Trainees are judged as having successfully completed the program provided that they have: (1) achieved at least a B+ (3.3) average in the core courses, (2) achieved a satisfactory grade in each quarter of Foundations of Neuroscience, (3) achieved satisfactory grades in all rotations, and (4) identified a participating faculty member who has agreed to serve as their thesis advisor. Competitive INP candidates will have had a substantial subset of courses covering the following topic areas: neuroscience, biology, biochemistry, psychology, physics, calculus, and genetics. Preference will be given to applicants who have had laboratory research experience. Following completion of the INP and selection of a thesis mentor, students will become members of the faculty member's participating department. In addition to the INP course work requirements, each department has specific requirements to be fulfilled, indicated below. Students who select a thesis advisor in the School of Biological Sciences (Department of Developmental and Cell Biology, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, or Neurobiology and Behavior) will complete the doctoral degree in Biological Sciences.
