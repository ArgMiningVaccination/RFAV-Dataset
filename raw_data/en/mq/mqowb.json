It was an opportune time for California to intensify its efforts to eliminate TB due to the declining number of TB cases in the state and the decrease in community transmission of TB. The purpose of the first Plan was to address the large pool of untreated latent TB infection (LTBI) strategically, which, in many persons, progresses to active and infectious TB disease. While California has made great strides in controlling TB in the last 30 years, disparities among populations have increased, especially among Asian and Pacific Islander populations. In 2020, the case rate among Asians born outside of the United States was 50 times higher than the case rate of U.S.-born Whites.1 Additionally, as the average age of a person with TB has increased, TB treatment has become more chal-lenging, due to co-morbidities more commonly found among older patients. TB persists as a deadly disease in California: 10% do not survive treatment and one in six die within five years of diagnosis.2 Catastrophic costs occur for patients and families, and direct and societal costs in California were over $180 million in 2020.3 The CTEAC membership includes TB controllers, medical and public health experts, aca - demic partners and TB survivors. In December 2020, CTEAC members and partners met to update the statewide 2016-2020 TB Elimination Plan for 2021-2025. During the meet - ing, the progress made from the first Plan was reviewed. Meeting attendees then partici - pated in a comprehensive review of the barriers to elimination and proposed Plan action steps for 2021-2025. The barriers which challenge TB prevention addressed by this Plan include: 1) a lack of awareness and engagement among high risk populations and their providers; 2) patient and health system impediments to affordable TB prevention ser-vices; 3) the absence of a required performance measure for LTBI testing and treatment; 4) a lack of electronic health record (EHR) and LTBI surveillance systems to support and track LTBI continuity of care; 5) the absence of continuous, dedicated resources to sup-port TB prevention; and 6) Pre-elimination by 2035 20502 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Executive SummaryBuilding upon the achievements of the first Plan, the California Tuberculosis Elimination Plan, 2021-2025, presents an action plan for the TB prevention and control community and its partners to move the TB elimination dial even further toward the state's goals. The new Plan presents bold TB elimination targets, including, by 2025, to: reduce the annual number of TB cases by 30% to 1,500; reduce TB disparities among non-U.S.-born Californians by 25%; and reduce annual TB deaths also by 25%, to 150. New targets for TB pre-elimination and elimination have also been set \u2014 to reach pre-elimination (400 cases/year) by 2035 and full elimination (40 cases/year) by 2050. The updated Plan provides recommendations which focus on: 1) engaging populations at risk and their pro-viders; 2) ensuring implementation of effective strate-gies for LTBI testing and treatment; 3) implementing a statewide LTBI surveillance system; 4) securing suffi-cient resources for Plan implementation; and 5) con - ducting research to evaluate TB prevention strategies. Each Plan recommendation is supported by new action steps which provide a roadmap for success. Compared to the status quo, if California reaches TB elimination by 2050, the state can avert 36,000 cases of TB disease and 3,600 TB deaths and save one billion dollars in medical costs and an additional one billion dollars in societal costs. New areas of focus in the updated Plan include: new efforts to promote TB-related health equity; an intensified focus on outreach and education to high risk communities; educat-ing providers about the importance of measuring the LTBI care cascade and supporting their efforts to do this work; using new LTBI reporting requirements to stimulate prevention efforts; promoting synergistic efforts across new local and state-level elimination plans; working with healthcare plans to promote the new U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation for LTBI testing; establishing a research network focusing on LTBI; and facilitating opportunities to build on COVID-19 and TB synergies. A multitude of partners is needed to successfully implement the Plan, including local TB programs; primary care providers and community health clinics (CHCs); public and private healthcare systems; community- based organizations; TB survivors; new funders; academic researchers; and others. The Plan outlines actions for TB elimination to ensure the >2 million Californians with LTBI are detected and successfully treated, and future cases of active TB are prevented.3 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Executive SummaryWhile there are challenges to reaching elimination which are further complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic, many opportunities exist to make progress on TB elimination, includ - ing: 1) the ability to focus on TB prevention due to a nadir in TB transmission; 2) research demonstrating that LTBI testing and treatment of high risk populations is cost-effective; 3) new tools for LTBI testing and treatment scale-up; 4) new LTBI surveillance reporting streams; and 5) the ability to address the potential synergies of COVID-19 and TB dis - ease prevention. In addition, at the national level, the USPSTF now recommends testing of all non-U.S.-born persons for LTBI and CDC has launched a national TB prevention and elimination campaign. Ongoing monitoring and evaluation of this Plan is paramount to its success. The evalua - tion plan includes a logic model which communicates the overall evaluation strategy and detailed measurements to assess the Plan's implementation. Specific outcomes targeted for 2025 include: 1) an increase in both LTBI testing and treatment completion to 80% and 77%, respectively; 2) a reduction in annual case numbers (1,500 cases/year); 3) a reduction in the non-U.S.-born TB case rate by at least 25%; and 4) reduced TB deaths (150/year). Below are the 40 action steps (abbreviated) for the California TB Elimination Plan, 2021- 2025, recommended by CTEAC members and stakeholders to overcome the obstacles that challenge effective implementation of TB prevention activities. Annually, CTEAC members and partners will monitor the implementation of the Plan with the intent to achieve the targets presented for 2025.4 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Executive SummaryCalifornia Tuberculosis Elimination Plan A Five-Year Action Plan, 2021-2025 RECOMMENDATION 1 Find and engage persons at high risk and their providers 1.

Since TB disease was at a nadir and community transmission of TB was limited, the purpose was to address strategically the large pool of untreated LTBI, which remains the main driver of TB disease in Califor - nia. The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) TB Elimination Plan, 2016-2020 stimulated a multitude of efforts that led to an ongoing bold movement towards achieving TB elimination. The primary strategy of the state's first TB Elimination Plan was to intensify targeted testing and treatment of LTBI while simultaneously controlling TB disease, as the core functions of TB control must be maintained while TB prevention activities expand to hasten prog - ress towards elimination. To intensify TB prevention, the Plan outlined 68 action steps to: 1) identify and engage persons and populations at high risk for TB, and the providers who serve them; 2) apply focused and effec-tive strategies for TB testing and optimization of LTBI treatment; 3) develop and maintain strong and effective partnerships with elimination stakeholders; 4) create effective communication strategies to promote TB prevention to both providers and high risk populations; 5) improve LTBI surveillance; and 6) secure sufficient resources for implementing the Plan. During the 2016-2020 timeframe of the first Plan, leaders and partners participating in California's TB elimination efforts made incredible progress across all of the Plan's rec-ommendations outlined above. Highlights of successes include the development and adoption of TB risk assessment tools and a documented increase in the use of IGRAs \u2014 a more effective LTBI diagnostic test than the traditionally used TB skin test. Prog-ress in treating persons with LTBI with the recommended short-course LTBI regimens also occurred, and the majority of Medi-Cal Managed Care plans in California now cover rifapentine on their formularies. Advances with LTBI surveillance have been made as well, as positive IGRA results became reportable in California in 2018. Scale-up of TB prevention in primary care settings occurred with seven clinical sites in California measur - ing their LTBI care cascades. New grants of limited size have enabled increased commu -Improving healthcare outcomes for California's most vulnerable populations is a prerequisite of TB elimination.9 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Backgroundnity engagement with high risk populations and have contributed to the start-up of local TB coalitions. Underpinning the successes of the last five years is the CDPH TB Free California proj - ect, the only statewide program with dedicated funding for TB prevention. The program's goal is to increase testing and treatment of LTBI in order to prevent cases of TB disease. TB Free California works to train healthcare providers who serve high risk populations to measure LTBI testing and treatment completion in community clinical settings and provides patient education and engagement of populations at highest risk of LTBI. In addition, the project contributes to state and national efforts to build data systems that measure LTBI care. This work aligns with the CDPH Strategic Map and Public Health 2035, strengthening infrastructure for a foundational public health service and promoting health equity through disease prevention. Since the project's inception in 2017, TB Free California staff estimate that the clinics they have worked with have screened more than 29,000 individuals for TB risk factors and have tested more than 7 ,500 high risk patients for TB. Quality improvement projects with the clinics TB Free California staff have worked with have shown a 50-100% increase in LTBI treatment completion. Collectively, the efforts of TB Free California and other successes achieved in 2016-2020 mentioned above, in addition to many others, have successfully laid the groundwork for creating meaningful change, i.e., translating to TB case decline during the next five years. For a more detailed overview of progress made during 2016-2020, see Appendix C. Despite the multitude of successes, many challenges for optimizing TB prevention still loom, including those presented by the COVID-19 pandemic which startled the nation in early 2020. To tackle these challenges, in December 2020, CTEAC members, liaisons and stakeholders met to review the evidence for proposed strategies and action steps for an updated California TB Elimination Plan for 2021-2025. The role of the CTEAC body, which is comprised of TB controllers, medical and public health experts, community-based organization representatives, TB survivors and researchers, is to review the evidence-bases for TB elimination strategies and to monitor the implemen - tation of the statewide Plan. The Committee was expanded to include new members and stakeholders before updating the Plan for 2021-2025. The first Plan's framework and action steps were modified to address the current imped - iments to making substantial progress in meeting the state's TB elimination targets. As an example, the absence of dedicated resources to support TB prevention is an impedi - ment to making substantial progress on TB elimination in California. TB control programs 10 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Backgroundhave been unable to fully give TB prevention the priority it deserves given sparse funding and ongoing complex TB disease management challenges. The absence of dedicated resources to support TB prevention is a major impediment to making substantial progress on TB elimination in California.Another impediment to elimination is the lack of a require - ment in California for providers or clinics to measure LTBI testing and treatment \u2014 which has the potential to change healthcare practice expeditiously. Furthermore, a systematic TB prevention approach is stymied by mul-tiple independent EHR systems operating without inter-connection to each other and without being accessible to public health agencies. This results in the need for extraordinary efforts statewide to achieve a simple goal of effective LTBI surveillance and measurement of the LTBI care cascade. In addition to these broader barriers, impediments exist at the patient and provider levels. One impediment is the cost of IGRAs to individual patients who lack health insurance (or are underinsured) as well as healthcare plans and systems that are reluctant to assume the costs of these more expensive LTBI tests, despite their greater efficacy. Additionally, many community providers (e.g., providers in private practice groups, health maintenance organizations, community clinics) lack basic knowledge about TB prevention while others lack the bandwidth to provide education about LTBI treatment to their patients. Further - more, few provider groups have the processes in place to ensure their patients with LTBI are linked to care through treatment completion. Lastly, TB prevention research needs to be increased to identify the most effective interventions. The COVID-19 pandemic provides both challenges and opportunities for TB elimination in California. While the decline in TB case numbers in California was largely stagnant in recent years, in 2020 the TB case count decreased dramatically \u2014 more than 19%. This was the largest drop in an annual TB case count since 1981. It is likely that at least some of the decrease is related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The specific causes of this single year decline may not be known for some time. However, likely contributing factors include missing TB cases from: decreased detection of TB due to fewer patients seeking care or fewer TB diagnoses made when they sought care; decreased immigration because of travel restrictions or economic conditions; or decreased transmission of TB because of interventions to decrease COVID-19 spread, such as masking and reduced movement outside of households, as has been noted for influenza. It is expected there may be a rebound of TB disease in the near term when these conditions resolve, which will need to be tackled as TB prevention efforts expand. 11 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Purpose Purpose The California TB Elimination Plan, 2021-2025, represents an update to the state's first Plan (2016-2020). Its purpose is to outline actions that can be taken to ensure that the more than two million Californians with LTBI are diagnosed and successfully treated in order to prevent future cases of active TB as well as to accelerate the time to TB elimina - tion in the state. The overall human and economic consequences of persistent TB disease in California are the most compelling reasons to pursue elimination.In order to truly make progress on TB elimination, sub - stantial investments in targeted LTBI testing and treat - ment must be made. One TB elimination model demon - strated that TB cases would decrease only 1.3% per year if prevention and control activities continued at the same pace as in 2019.4 Intensifying targeted testing and treatment of LTBI must occur in parallel to ongoing TB disease detection and treatment efforts. It is critical that the detection of TB disease be timely, that treat-ment be effective and that thorough contact investiga-tions are completed. It is only with well-resourced and competent health departments that the core functions of TB control can be maintained while TB prevention activities expand to hasten progress towards elimination. There are several compelling reasons to intensify efforts to eliminate TB in California. The fact that the state has experienced a substantial decline in TB cases and TB mor - tality since the height of the TB resurgence in the 1980s and early 1990s is just one. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that recent transmission of TB is at a nadir and that the percentage of TB contributed by recent arrivers has declined by 50% since overseas TB screening and treatment were improved in 2007.5 This significant improvement, in addition to better LTBI tests and new short-course treatments (and other TB elimination successes since 2016), creates new opportunities to prevent TB by focusing on reducing the size of the LTBI reservoir in California. 12 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Purpose Compared to the status quo, if California reaches TB elimination by 2050, the state can avert 36,000 cases of TB disease and 3,600 deaths with TB, and save one billion dollars in medical costs and an additional one billion dollars in societal costs. Finally, there are new nationwide efforts that are supporting TB elimination. CDC is actively pursuing a TB elimination campaign and, as of 2020, is requiring states and cities that receive federal funding for TB prevention and control to develop elimination plans for their respective jurisdictions. Targets for California TB Elimination Plan, 2021-2025 \u2014 Status quo versus intervention Further rationale that the time is right for California to focus on TB elimination is the substantial evidence that TB prevention is cost-effective.6,7 It is much less costly to test and treat an individual with LTBI than for TB disease. The cost to prevent TB for one per-son is minimal ($790) compared to the cost of diagnosing and treating one person with active TB disease ($43,900).8 From a population perspective, studies have revealed the cost-effectiveness of testing non-U.S.-born individuals and treating those who have LTBI.9 2,500 2,0001,5001,000 500 0Number of Cases 2020 2025Pre-elimination EliminationStatus quo Intervention 2035 205013 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Purpose One study found that targeted testing with IGRAs and short-course treatment for LTBI among non-U.S.-born persons, both with and without comorbidities, are both effective as well as cost-effective.10 Perhaps most impor - tantly, the overall human and economic consequences of persistent TB disease in California are the most com-pelling reasons to pursue elimination. If not prevented, TB disease can result in hospitalization, disability and most critically, premature death. For example, half of individuals diagnosed with TB are hospitalized for treat-ment or disease complications; these hospitalizations are twice as expensive and four times longer than hospitalizations for other conditions.11 Individuals' inability to work and loss of income due to TB disease affect their families and leads to an overall depreciation in their quality of life. The cost to prevent TB for one person is minimal ($790) compared to the cost of diagnosing and treating one person with active TB disease ($43,900) . Furthermore, the TB death toll is daunting12: in California, one in 10 diagnosed with TB disease dies, either during therapy or before treatment2; one in six dies of TB within five years of diagnosis. If trends in case burden continue, by 2050 there will have been approximately 5,600 deaths with TB in California. TB has tragic consequences2,13-17 Death 1 in 6 die within five years of diagnosis 10% do not survive treatment Disability After treatment, impaired lung function and shorter life expectancy >80% of children with CNS TB die or permanently disabled Hospitalization 2x expensive and 4x longer than hospitalizations for other conditions Cost Catastrophic costs to patients and families >$180 million in direct and societal costs in California in 202014 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Purpose Since 2016, there are additional opportunities for scaling up TB prevention efforts. These include: COVID-19 response innovations which can advance outreach, testing capacity and facilitate an important disparity focus for TB prevention; and research findings from CDC's TB Epidemiologic Studies Consortium (TBESC) which provide evidence and new strategies for changing practice. In addition to this updated Elimination Plan, new plans from three California cities with high TB morbidity \u2014 Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco \u2014 will help to focus synergistic efforts to reach California's TB elimination targets. TB elimination in California The World Health Organization defines TB elimination as <1 case of TB disease/million, which translates to an elimination target of 40 cases per year in California. In 2019, 2,115 TB cases were reported in California. While TB control efforts successfully reduced TB disease to below the epidemic threshold of <100 cases/million in 2000, the current case count is still five times higher than the pre-elimination target and 50 times higher than the elimination target. To reach pre-elimination in the state by 2035 (400 cases), a 10% annual decline in TB cases must occur. The 2021-2025 Elimination Plan sets new TB disease targets for the next five years and beyond, as shown in the following tables. Targets for California TB Elimination Plan, 2021-2025 \u2014 TB disease, disparities and death Outcomes Current Status (2019) Targets Cases Rate Cases Rate Year Reduce TB cases by at least 30%2,115 53/million 1,500 38/million 2025 Reduce TB disparities \u2014 least 25%1,772 163/million 1,222 3.8/million 202515 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Purpose Pre-elimination and elimination Outcomes Targets Cases Rate Year Pre-elimination 400 <10/million 2035 Elimination 40 <1/million 2050 To create a TB-free California in the near future, strategic thinking and bold actions are needed. As an example, to reach these targets, two million non-U.S.-born persons will need to be tested for LTBI annually. The Plan's action steps provide a roadmap for achiev - ing these metrics. The faces of TB in California In recent years, the TB public health community has endeavored to bring the faces of TB to the forefront. Each case of TB represents an individual, along with each of their families and larger communities, who has suffered from TB, a preventable disease. Until recently, these persons have remained largely invisible, yet we know that clinical and public health providers can learn a lot from those who have experienced TB first-hand. Patient advocacy organizations such as \"We are TB\" provide peer support to TB patients and also serve as advocates for TB diagnostics, treatment and funding. These advocates have been through the wear and tear of long treatments for TB and can share their insights with providers and public health experts to facilitate improvements in healthcare delivery. Furthermore, TB survivors can serve as invaluable supporters and champions for current TB patients going through TB treatment.TB kills and disables Californians every year, and stark disparities persist. We can prevent TB and its consequences.16 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Purpose TB survivors are also the TB community's most powerful messengers. Their unique per - spectives contribute to crafting effective prevention messaging for high risk populations. They can provide heartfelt persuasion to encourage those with LTBI to accept treatment to prevent their infection from becoming active and spreading. A great example is Khayr, a TB survivor, who shares a piece of his story18: \"If I had been sat down when I was 19 and told, 'hey, you have latent TB, and if you don't finish your treatment, it can develop into dangerous TB disease,' I would have done so. It would have saved me a lot of grief in the future. It would have saved me seven months in isolation. So I think stopping TB at that initial stage, when it's latent, and when you're not infectious, I think is something that we need to educate more people about. In California, a number of efforts are underway to engage TB survivors to speak out about their experiences. So far, at least one local TB elimination coalition has a number of TB patient advocates who are active in the group. The TB community can benefit from pro-viding opportunities for these advocates to share their experiences. Intended audience The audiences of the California TB Elimination Plan, 2021-2025 are public health practi - tioners; community providers; health plan leaders; policymakers; community organizations and TB coalitions; and other partners in the public and private sectors who serve popu - lations at risk for TB. Ultimately, the Plan is intended to benefit all Californians as efforts to make California TB-free will be of benefit to all of the state's residents. The Plan will be used by CTEAC and its partners to monitor and advance progress on TB elimination and identify and overcome barriers to successful implementation. 17 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Purpose Key concepts TB prevention. While many activities are needed to control and reduce the number of TB cases in California, the term \"TB prevention,\" as used in this report, specifically refers to targeted testing and treatment of LTBI. The term can also be used to describe other activi - ties that contribute to TB disease prevention (e.g., early detection and treatment of TB, iso - lation of patients with infectious TB, contact investigation, bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination and environmental preventing transmission of Mycobacterium TB ). \"TB prevention\" in this Plan primarily refers to preventing LTBI from reactivating and devel - oping into infectious TB disease. LTBI care cascade. The care cascade outlines the steps from initial TB screening through LTBI treatment. The purpose of measuring each step of the care cascade is to assess the number of patients who are lost at each stage of the cascade so interventions can be implemented to limit attrition and ensure the completion of LTBI treatment, the final step of the cascade. Supporting best practices for these efforts is integral to continu-ity of care, which ultimately promotes TB elimination.

This Plan describes strategic actions that TB elimi- nation stakeholders can implement in California. While national and international policies and activities strongly influence TB disease trends in the state, the primary focus of this Plan is what can be accomplished in California within a five-year period. Innovations and research. Many recent advances and innovations, such as LTBI diagnostic and treatment regimens and technologies, are central to this Plan. It is under-stood that new and ongoing research is needed to improve current methods for LTBI testing, treatment and surveillance, among other areas. Because ongoing research is crucial, this updated Plan includes a new recommendation with correlating action steps for conducting research to evaluate TB prevention strategies. Collaboration with local TB programs with TB elimination plans With the intent to coordinate TB elimination efforts throughout the state, CDPH TB Control Branch leadership regularly meets with leaders from the three local health departments that are directly-funded by CDC's Division of TB Elimination. As of 2020, each of these jurisdictions (Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco) was required to develop and implement a TB elimination plan. Regular meetings and coordination across efforts during this five-year period will reduce duplication of effort and identify best practices. 19 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Epidemiology of Tuberculosis in California Epidemiology of Tuberculosis in California TB is a communicable disease that is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tubercu- losis ( M. tuberculosis ). When a person becomes infected with M. tuberculosis , the bac- teria are usually contained by the immune system and remain dormant in the lungs; this condition is called LTBI. Approximately one-third of the world's population has LTBI. This condition is not infectious, nor does it create any symptoms unless it progresses. Most people do not even know that they have LTBI. In approximately five to 10% of people with LTBI, the TB infection will progress. In these people the TB bacte-ria will multiply and spread inside their bodies, creat - ing an infectious form of the condition, referred to as \"TB disease\" or \"active disease,\" which usually creates symptoms in the person. If left untreated, TB disease is life-threatening and remains the leading cause of global death from a bacterial agent.19 While LTBI is common worldwide, and TB disease may be deadly, treatment for both LTBI and TB is available. LTBI can be treated so it does not progress to TB disease, and TB can be treated so the patient is cured and is no longer infectious or symptomatic. Tools for diagnosis and treatment are available, yet many barriers to identifying and treating both conditions exist. In California, these barriers include limited experience in the diagnosis and treatment of LTBI and TB disease among most healthcare providers. More than two million Californians are infected with TB, and most are unaware of their infection and have not been treated. California TB and LTBI risk profile California is home to a large, diverse population that represents the highly mobile global community. Ten million individuals, or 27% of California's population of 39 million, were born outside the U.S., many from regions with an elevated TB burden.20 Additionally, over 11 million individuals enter California from outside the U.S. each year. An example of this diversity is that 50% of California's 10 million children under age 18 have a non-U.S.-born parent.21 Adding to this population with potential exposure to TB earlier in their lives is the large and growing elderly population comprised of two million residents who are 75 years old or older.22 Many U.S.-born and non-U.S.-born individuals exposed to TB in childhood have chronic medical conditions that increase their risk of progressing to TB 20 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Epidemiology of Tuberculosis in Californiadisease. Overall, more than two million California residents are estimated to have LTBI; approximately 90% of them were born outside the U.S.23 TB trends and patient characteristics through 2020 TB case numbers in California have declined by 60% since the peak of the recent epi - demic in 1992, and the case rate has declined by 70%. However, other than the substan-tial drop in case numbers in 2020 previously discussed, since 2014, case numbers have largely been at a standstill; and TB disparities among different populations have not only persisted, but increased. In 2020, Asians born outside of the U.S. were diagnosed with TB at 50 times the rate of U.S.-born Whites, which far outstrips disparities by race/eth - nicity noted in HIV, heart disease and diabetes.24-26 Similarly, the TB case rates among non-U.S.-born Blacks and Hispanics were 51 and 20 times higher, respectively, than of U.S.-born Whites. TB is >40x higher in non-U.S.-born Asian and Black communities than in U.S.-born White communities.

During the recent period of economic health and employment (before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic), migration into California increased and migration out of California decreased. While adop - tion of innovations in LTBI testing and treatment of LTBI has advanced, the scale of preven - tion efforts needed has not been achieved. In addition, the TB disease that has been averted by LTBI testing and treatment takes time to show up as a case count drop as it is preventing disease that would otherwise occur in the future. The graph below illustrates the decline of TB disease in recent years. Reported TB cases: California, 1990-2020 The disease disparities previously noted reflect the diverse countries of origin of Califor - nia's TB cases as key population changes occurred in California from 2014-2020. The Asian population has increased at a greater rate than other racial and ethnic groups. Among persons age 65 and older, population numbers of non-U.S.-born Asians increased by approximately 24% from 2014-2019, as did elderly, non-U.S.-born Latinx. Elderly per - sons born outside the U.S. with LTBI are at a high risk of progression to active TB and the racial and ethnic disparities in TB among population groups reflect this growing pop-ulation.1,703 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 20206,000 5,000 4,000 3,000 2,000 1 ,000 0Number of Cases22 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Epidemiology of Tuberculosis in CaliforniaThe top five non-U.S. countries of origin for patients with TB disease in California have remained constant over the last 14 years, with Mexico, the Philippines, Vietnam, China and India contributing 76% of California's non-U.S.-born-cases in 2019. The majority of these TB cases occur in those who have been in California for many years. At least half of all non-U.S.-born TB cases in California occurred more than 20 years after arrival in the U.S. Furthermore, nearly half of TB cases are among non-U.S.-born residents who enter the U.S. with immigrant or refugee status and are screened for TB disease (but not LTBI) before entering the U.S. While disparities among different ethnic and racial groups have increased, the \"face of TB\" is also changing, as the average age of a person with TB has been increasing. In 2020, the median age of TB patients was 54 years, and approximately 40% of TB patients had at least one medical co-morbidity, such as diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal dis - ease, anti-tumor- necrosis-factor therapy or other treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, solid organ transplantation, HIV infection or other immunosuppressive conditions.1 These co-existing conditions increase the risk of progression to TB disease from asymp - tomatic and non-infectious LTBI. Finally, in California from 2015-2017, 10% of cases died with TB, a treatable \u2014 and preventable \u2014 disease. During the past five years, there has been little change in how TB cases arise in California. More than 80% of TB disease in California result from progression of previously acquired infection (LTBI) to active disease. Another 12% is from recent transmission within Califor - nia communities; and 8% is imported, i.e., from new arrivers who are diagnosed with TB disease within one year of arrival in the U.S. Finally, a very small percentage, less than 1% of TB disease, may be generated as a result of relapse of previously treated active disease or from re-infection. The high cost of treating TB disease Hospitalizations are twice as expensive and four times longer than hospitalizations for other conditions8 TB disease cost California more than $180 million dollars in 2020 (including the cost of premature death due to TB)323 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Epidemiology of Tuberculosis in CaliforniaWith effective interventions, TB cases could decrease during the next decade. Much of the decrease will depend on the implementation of targeted testing and treatment of LTBI among long-standing residents and new migrants. Models of TB in California27 estimate that one-time testing of 25% to 50% of the non-U.S.-born population would result in a substantial decline of TB cases. Testing among other populations at risk, such as persons with co-morbidities, will reduce new cases but alone cannot achieve TB elimination. It is important to note that despite the large scale of targeted testing and treatment necessary to achieve a substantial reduction in TB case burden, the approach is reasonably cost-ef - fective in populations at risk. For example, targeted testing and treatment among non-U.S.-born persons is estimated to cost $82,486 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY).28 Cost-effectiveness thresholds have been set at $50,000 per QALY, though $100,000 per QALY is also now routinely used. Many of the populations most affected by TB are also affected by COVID-19. For exam - ple, most persons who had both TB and COVID-19 in 2020 were Latinx (58%) or Asian (34%), and 85% were born outside of the U.S.1 \u2014 all of which demonstrate overlap of communities disproportionately affected by both COVID-19 and TB. The COVID-19 pan-demic has highlighted the importance of place and health equity indices and has revealed the overlap of communities with high TB incidence and lower socioeconomic opportunity with COVID-19 and other health conditions. These California communities that experi-ence many disease disparities are important areas for TB prevention focus. In the fall of 2020, the California TB Control Branch performed a preliminary match of TB and COVID-19 registries and found high mortality among persons who had both recent or concurrent TB and COVID-19. This analysis also revealed the overlap in patient risks and communities affected by both respiratory diseases. Despite this tragedy, it also provides an opportunity for California's TB elimination leaders and partners.24 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Tuberculosis Control and Prevention in California Tuberculosis Control and Prevention in California Each of California's 61 local health departments is responsible for overseeing the care of TB patients, responding to and preventing TB transmission in its community and pre - venting TB in individuals at high risk. Local health departments perform these functions through direct patient care and/or partnerships with community providers, including hos - pitals, health maintenance organizations, federally-qualified health centers (FQHCs) and other community clinics, private physician networks and individual providers. Local TB control programs are supported by funding from federal, state and local gov - ernments. The percentage of each government's contribution varies for each local health department. Three large health departments in California \u2014 the counties of Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco \u2014 and the state TB control program, receive cooperative agreement funding from the CDC Division of TB Elimination. The majority of resources for TB control for local health departments come from their county level governments, which, during fiscal year 2019-2020, covered approximately 71% of TB program budgets. Medi-Cal, the Medicaid program in California, is also a key payer for healthcare for Californians with TB and LTBI. The California TB Control Branch provides technical assistance, resources, outbreak assistance and con sult ation on diagnosis and management of drug resistant TB and guid - ance on TB pre vention and control efforts. The program collects, interprets and dissem - inates surveillance data. Local health departments carry out TB preven tion and control activities, including surveil lance, epide miology and direct services to individuals with, and at risk for, TB infection and disease within their geographic area. California's healthcare landscape is diverse, ranging from Kaiser Permanente, the largest of the primary care providers, to FQHCs, to community clinics and private, academic and hospital associa - tion clinics. These community and primary care providers have an essential role in the man age ment of patients with both TB disease and L TBI. Testing and treatment for LTBI Since 2016, use of IGRAs for TB testing has expanded greatly. The IGRA is preferred over the TB skin test to diagnose LTBI because evidence demonstrates superior specificity, better performance in predicting TB disease and greater efficiency because it can be com-pleted during a single visit.29 Knowledge gaps and barriers, such as cost and phlebotomy 25 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Tuberculosis Control and Prevention in Californiaaccess, however, need to be tackled for broader adoption among healthcare providers. In parallel, short-course LTBI regimens of three to four months have also increased in use, and in addition to trials demonstrating value over longer isoniazid (INH) therapy, model - ing4 and cost-effectiveness studies10 have also been published that support their use. Based on current evidence and the USPSTF recommendation to screen asymptomatic adults at risk for LTBI, updated LTBI treatment guidelines from CDC29 were published in February 2020, along with a number of practical tools that further support scale-up of LTBI testing and treatment. TB screening programs in California are currently in place and cover an estimated 1.7 mil - lion individuals each year. The populations screened \u2014 which include teachers, employ - ees and volunteers in schools; healthcare workers; and correctional inmates, parolees and employees - have varying risks of TB. Programs in place to screen populations at higher risk of TB include testing of individuals that are recent contacts to a known TB case; new immigrants arriving in the U.S. who had an abnormal chest radiograph during their overseas exam (B-notification arrivers); and individuals who apply to adjust their immigration status from a temporary to a permanent status (status adjusters). For decades, many individuals tested each year in California had a low risk for TB, and many were re-tested annually without acquiring any new risk to justify repeat testing. Initial and re-testing of low risk populations use limited resources needed for effective TB prevention and control and can result in false-positive tests, unnecessary treatment and adverse treatment effects. In 2016, the TB Control Branch, together with the California TB Controllers Association (CTCA) and the Curry International TB Center (CITC), produced a TB screening risk assessment tool to allow for risk screening of individuals prior to actual TB testing. Dif - ferent versions of this tool were developed for specific populations (e.g., adult, pediatric, school staff), and have been widely disseminated in both California and elsewhere in the U.S. Further adoption of these tools is needed and will likely occur as more widespread promotion of the USPSTF screening recommendation occurs, resulting in an increase in risk-based TB screening. Increased use of and access to short-course LTBI treatment has also occurred since 2016, and rifapentine \u2014 a key ingredient in these treatment regimens \u2014 has been included in the formulary of 86% of Medi-Cal Managed Care plans as well as on the My Health LA pharmacy formulary. These interventions have reduced barriers for accessing short-course regimens and can help persons complete TB prevention therapy.26 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Tuberculosis Control and Prevention in CaliforniaDespite the longstanding availability of treatment for LTBI and the newer treatment and testing methods, getting individuals through each step of testing and treatment for LTBI remains a challenge. California's local health departments and community provider partners perform testing and treatment for LTBI, but have had variable success in get-ting all patients at high risk through the full LTBI testing and treatment cascade. Without a vaccine, medication to treat LTBI remains the cornerstone of preventing TB disease. Ensuring that plan formularies include the shortest, most effective LTBI treatment regimens is an essential step for equitable access to TB prevention.A TB prevention care cascade (see figure on page 17) outlines the discrete steps needed to diagnose and treat people with LTBI. Treatment and prevention steps involve engaging and testing individuals with a high risk for TB, identifying individuals who should be tested for LTBI and starting and completing LTBI treatment in those individuals. At each step, patients and preven - tion opportunities can be lost, so \"measuring\" a clinic's care cascade allows effective interventions to be imple - mented to decrease patient attrition at each step. For example, only a small proportion of populations at high risk of LTBI receives a TB skin test or an IGRA. In Cali-fornia, in 2018, 77% of identified contacts to sputum smear-positive pulmonary TB cases were completely evaluated, but only 67% of those identified with LTBI started treatment, and only 58% of those who started actually finished their full course of treatment. Rates of treatment completion have somewhat improved as more local health departments have adopted shorter treatment regimens (i.e., three- or four-month), but to make real prog - ress with TB prevention, much higher completion rates must be achieved. Increasing success at each step of the cascade can have a substantial impact on California' s ability to achieve TB elimination. Especially needed is a performance quality measure related to LTBI care at the state or national level. The TB Control Branch has drafted two metrics and gathered support - ing documentation for submission in 2023 to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Ser - vices (CMS) to apply for inclusion in the Adult and Child Core Set of quality measures. If approved, these metrics will be a powerful tool for increasing LTBI screening, testing and treatment among community providers in particular. Because the adoption of LTBI metrics at a national level is uncertain and timing is unknown, California will need to sup - port statewide measures for primary care settings in order to realize the TB prevention improvements needed for populations at risk. 27 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Tuberculosis Control and Prevention in CaliforniaHealthcare services and payer sources In California, healthcare services for TB are provided through a complex and variable healthcare delivery system, which can impede consistent LTBI testing and treatment activities. Among the 61 local health departments in California, just 21 reported 95% of all TB cases in California in 2010-2018. Nineteen of these 21 local health departments are able to provide direct patient care through county or local health system clinics or TB program-run health clinics; two have no county-affiliated TB clinics.30 However, the pro- portion of patients cared for in a public health department has declined significantly in the past 10 years; just 49% of patients with TB disease in 2016-2018 received the majority of their TB care in a clinic associated with a public health department. Patients who do not receive their care in a public clinic receive care in the private sector or have care pro - vided jointly by both community providers and a public health clinic. Across both private and public healthcare systems, providers' knowledge of TB varies, depending on the provider's level of experience and the prevalence of TB in each of their respective regions. In 2016, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force published a recommendation to primary care providers to screen non-U.S.-born asymptomatic adults for LTBI. The federal Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010, pro - vided new opportunities for health departments to provide TB prevention services. In 2014, Medi-Cal was expanded, and since then California has reduced its number of uninsured residents by more than 200%. In 2019, California further expanded Medi-Cal eligibility for undocumented immigrant adults under age 26. Safety net coverage for undocumented adults 26 and over remains scarce, although some counties offer their own plans for this population (e.g., Alameda Alliance for Health) or have policies to provide services regardless of immigration status in their respective county-funded clinics. Barriers to care still exist for many Californians who qualify for health insurance, either because they are not enrolled or because other health plans do not cover all TB services at no cost to the patient. California continues to be in a transition period of improving access to care for all and reducing health disparities. In 2016, the USPSTF published a grade B recommendation for primary care providers to screen asymptomatic adults for LTBI in populations at increased risk. With this designation, patients cannot be required to pay out-of-pocket for LTBI testing, ensuring that all high risk individuals (with commercial insurance or who are eligible for Medi-Cal) are provided the first step in critical TB prevention care through public, individual and employer-pro -28 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Tuberculosis Control and Prevention in Californiavided health insurance plans.29 However, a further barrier to TB treatment as prevention still remains, as many health insurance plans still do not categorize a chest x-ray and LTBI treatment as preventive services, so these crucial steps toward TB elimination may still incur costs for the patient. In addition, some public health department-run clinics providing LTBI testing and treat- ment for contacts to TB cases that are referred to them but do not offer employment-re - lated LTBI testing and treatment, routine risk assessments or targeted LTBI testing and treatment for their patient populations. California's diverse groups of providers, including local public health departments, civil surgeon physicians, Medi-Cal providers, primary care providers (including FQHCs, Kai - ser and others) and college/university health centers, are an important current and future source of TB prevention. The table below provides an overview of who is caring for TB patients in California (as of 2019). Selected large volume providers of care for those at risk for TB (2019) Providers of Care Patients Served Local public health departments12,000 contacts to TB patients 7,000 immigrants and refugees Many thousands receive TB prevention servicesat TB public health clinics Civil surgeon physicians 100,000 immigration status adjustors Medi-Cal providers 13.5 million Californians enrolled in Medi-Cal(approximately 1/3 of the state's population; exactnumber of enrollees at risk for TB is unknown) Primary care providers >5 million Californians served by FQHCs >9 million Californians served by Kaiser Permanente >100,000 Californians served by other primary careproviders Providers at college/university health centers 161,693 international students in California colleges/universities (2018-19 school year)29 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Tuberculosis Control and Prevention in CaliforniaIf a patient with TB meets specific income and other eligibility criteria, that patient can be enrolled in Medi-Cal, which covers TB diagnosis, treatment and case management expenses. Some local health departments can bill Medi-Cal for reimbursement. Despite the expansion of Medi-Cal coverage and insurance not tied to employers, gaps in coverage remain for undocumented immigrants, many of whom are not eligible for Medi-Cal or for subsidies to purchase health insurance plans through Covered California. Many undocumented immigrants and low-wage workers do not have employer-provided health plans, so they must rely on public or individually-purchased plans. This creates impediments for reaching this Plan's elimination targets, as up to 500,000 undocumented persons are estimated to have LTBI, and comprise roughly 15-25% of patients with TB disease in California.10 While there have been important advances in increasing access to TB prevention ser-vices since 2016, many challenges remain. In California's Medi-Cal Managed Care plans, LTBI testing using the TB skin test is covered, but as of 2018, not all plans cover IGRA testing without prior provider approval. These tests are the gold standard for testing non-U.S.-born high risk individuals who were vaccinated with BCG in their home countries. Moreover, if someone has a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) or IGRA, these plans do not automatically cover tests to rule out active TB (e.g., chest x-ray) and confirm the LTBI diagnosis; physician orders are required as next steps. Further still, if an individual is found to have LTBI, not all plans cover the newer short-course LTBI regimens without prior approval. Finally, even if health plans reimburse for all LTBI-related services, provid - ers do not uniformly use IGRAs and short-course regimens, thus provider education and LTBI protocol development are needed. As of 2021, IGRAs and short-course regimens are still not uniformly classified by health plans as preventive services because the specific services that fulfill the LTBI \"preventive service\" vary among the different plans. Not only do both chest x-rays and LTBI treatment require the extra step of physician orders, patients may be liable for co-pays, which vary depending on the type of plan.30 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Tuberculosis Control and Prevention in CaliforniaBarriers to advancing TB prevention Limited awareness about TB prevention in affected communities Insufficient LTBI knowledge among healthcare providers Steps for healthcare access needed for those not in care Few streamlined paths in primary care to support patients through testing and treatment Electronic health record systems lack triggers and tracking options for TB prevention No required measure for LTBI testing/treatment in primary healthcare settings Cost barriers and lack of incentives for health systems and patients Limited resources focused on TB prevention Limited TB prevention research Local health departments' capacities to perform TB prevention activities Since the beginning of California's first TB Elimination Plan (2016), federal funding for TB has remained flat, despite increasing complexity of TB cases, increasing salaries and cost of living, and a stable number of cases in California. Of the 26 high and medium TB morbid-ity jurisdictions in California, only five jurisdictions reported an increase in funding in 2018 (one of which was one-time funding); the remaining 21 jurisdictions reported a decrease or no change in funding. These resource or funding gaps have led to negative impacts in local health departments' abilities to be able to provide core TB program functions includ - ing: contact investigation/B-notification (69% jurisdictions provide), case management (65%) and epidemiology/surveillance activities (69%). Unpublished 2018 data from the CDPH TB Program Assessment Tool (TPAT) shows six of the 26 high and medium burden jurisdictions reported a decrease in the number of TB-dedicated staff. Despite this landscape, TB programs have utilized creative solutions in order to maintain core TB control responsibilities. Programs have increased adoption of electronic directly- observed therapy; increased adoption and contracted services for TB clinical care. 31 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Tuberculosis Control and Prevention in CaliforniaAdditional challenges facing local TB programs include loss of contracts with hotels providing housing for infectious/non-infectious TB patients and limited locations for the detention of persistently non-adherent TB patients. While the COVID-19 pandemic has created additional barriers to providing TB care (redirected public health staff to COVID-19 response efforts, challenges in providing field service and in-person clinical care, stig-matization of overlapping impacted populations and limited resources of personal protec - tive equipment and hospital access), there are potential lessons learned that may impact future TB prevention and control activities. In 2018, CDC introduced a federal mandate for civil surgeons to report LTBI in immigrants seeking status adjustment to local health departments. At least four California local health departments, building upon this required change in reporting, advocated for additional resources to focus on LTBI surveillance, civil surgeon outreach and linkage to care in order to ensure treatment of those who tested positive. However, much work remains to be done to uniformly link all persons with LTBI to treatment initiation and treatment. Ensuring this continuity of care is key to meeting the state's TB elimination targets. The COVID-19 response brings important synergies in connecting patients to care and many repurposed TB tools that can increase TB prevention capacity in the state. One of the most important opportunities now available is human resources \u2014 California has leaders and champions committed to working to reach communities for preventive mea - sures hit hard by both COVID-19 and TB. For example, in San Diego, the TB program identified hot spots where COVID-19 pop-up sites can be coupled with TB risk assess-ment, testing and linkage to treatment. This type of strategy could be extremely effective if utilized in other regions in the state. Additional prevention efforts that are outlined in three new TB local elimination plans (e.g., Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco plans) will allow for a well-coordinated effort and will promote collaboration and replication of TB prevention efforts. 32 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Action Steps to Eliminate TB: 2021-2025 Action Steps to Eliminate TB: 2021-2025 The framework for the 2021-2025 California TB Elimination Plan is based on the frame - work and recommendations of the state's first Plan (2016-2020). This updated Plan includes a new recommendation to: \"conduct research to evaluate TB prevention strate - gies.\" Each recommendation is supported by a set of concrete action steps that designate specific actions, proposed lead organizations and partners and timelines with milestones. The action steps were developed to overcome the barriers that challenge TB prevention stakeholders. A logic model illustrating how Plan implementation will be evaluated can be found on page 57. The full evaluation is provided in Appendix E, and details specific objectives, performance measures and data sources. Health equity statement Improving the healthcare outcomes for California's most vulnerable populations is a prerequisite of TB elimination. The California TB Elimination Plan, 2021-2025, was developed with an emphasis on reducing health inequities in patient awareness, healthcare access and treatment outcomes in order to address the disproportionate impact of TB on non-U.S.-born persons.1 To address TB in subgroups defined by race, ethnicity, nativity and socioeconomic status, the following recommendations and actions are set forth. CTEAC members and its partners believe the work towards equity of healthcare access and outcomes is the foundation for TB elimination in California.33 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Action Steps to Eliminate TB: 2021-2025 RECOMMENDATION 1 Find and engage persons and populations at high risk for TB and their providers in California Since 2016, both public health providers as well as a growing number of community providers have become more engaged in TB prevention activities and key health sys - tems have taken steps to raise awareness about aspects of TB prevention. Successful collaborations have occurred to engage Medi-Cal Managed Care plan medical directors regarding the USPSTF recommend a tion to screen asymptomatic adults at risk for LTBI, and numerous new partner ships among local TB programs and community clinics have been developed. However, greater engagement among providers and health systems needs to occur, particu larly in primary care settings, so LTBI care cascade outcomes can be measured and improved. A first step to facilitating this effort is to overcome the barriers to physician and health system engagement, which include their lack of understanding and knowledge regarding TB prevention, particularly the value of prevention; the limited time providers have to spend with their patients; conflicting priorities; and the lack of visible leadership or \"cham - pions\" for TB prevention.31 In the last two years, the TB Control Branch identified the top primary care providers serving non-U.S.-born populations in California. Building on that work, the TB Control Branch plans to support local TB programs to conduct outreach to engage these providers in TB prevention activities. In addition to providers and health systems, community engagement is key for success. For high risk populations, which are hard to reach and have fewer connections to health - care, innovative strategies are needed to increase the engagement of these groups. Community engagement in TB prevention has occurred in a number of areas in the state, with San Diego, for example, leading a successful outreach effort in the Latinx population most hard hit by TB. Likewise, Los Angeles has seen success with a project that provides temporary housing to persons with LTBI and who are experiencing homelessness in order to facilitate completion of LTBI treatment. The TB program will soon be tracking the target population for those outcomes and is likely to show evidence of the project's success. In addition to healthcare access barriers among communities at risk (e.g., transportation, language, cost-sharing for services), lack of awareness about LTBI is common, which creates an impediment to seeking TB prevention services. One barrier is the frequently held belief that the BCG vaccine creates immunity to TB.32 Coupled with the stigma that exists with TB, creative strategies are needed to overcome these hurdles. 34 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Action Steps to Eliminate TB: 2021-2025One of the primary components of the TB Control Branch's TB Free California initia- tive is to increase engagement among high risk populations. Staff have produced and disseminated culturally and linguistically competent TB prevention materials for use in diverse settings and new partnerships with community-based organizations and other state government programs have been established. The project's community outreach has focused on engagement efforts to decrease TB case disparities among AANHPI pop - ulations as well as among Latinx communities. As mentioned earlier, disparities have been consistently high for the last decade. A primary strategy for successfully engaging providers, health systems and high risk com- munities in TB prevention activities is to strengthen existing partnerships as well as cre - ate and sustain new ones. Utilizing effective communication strategies is key to building these relationships.35 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Action Steps to Eliminate TB: 2021-2025Action steps for Recommendation 1 are outlined in the table below. Action Step Proposed Lead(s) and Partner(s) Provider and Health System Engagement 1.Conduct outreach and education to engage priority primary care providers in TB prevention activities Local TB programs TB Control Branch 2.Engage primary care medical organizations to message the value of TB prevention (LTBI testing and treatment) to their memberships CTCA TB Control Branch Medical associations TB 3.Implement a visible \"California TB Hero\" program to recognize providers and organization leaders excelling in scale-up of LTBI testing and treatment CTCA Local TB programs TB Control Branch 4.Partner with healthcare organizations focused on health equity and hepatitis B initiatives serving Asian, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander populations to increase LTBI testing and treatment TB Control Branch Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations (AAPCHO) Local TB programs CDPH Hepatitis program Hepatitis B Free Coalition 5.Implement a curriculum to train non-licensed health workers in CHCs to provide TB prevention messaging and linkage to care to high risk individuals in AANHPI and Latinx communities in areas with TB disparities Curry TB AAPCHO TB coalitions Local TB programs Federally-qualified health centers 36 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Action Steps to Eliminate TB: 2021-2025 Action Step Proposed Lead(s) and Partner(s) Community Engagement 6.Use findings from CDC's LTBI Communications Campaign research torevise and tailor communication populationsState education materials and/orcampaigns for diabetes, tobacco, HIV orother chronic diseases TB Control Branch CDPH AIDS Office CDPH Disease ControlBranch CDPH Tobacco Control Branch 8.Support TB survivors' efforts to increase TBprevention awareness and local TB coalitions 9.Implement TB public Latinx populations AAPCHO health group,TBD local coalitions Hep B United Coalition TB Control Branch 10.Identify the most effective patient educationmaterials and make accessible on a publicwebsite for use by TB programs, primarycare settings and patient advocates CTCA Local TB programs TB Control Branch37 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Action Steps to Eliminate TB: 2021-2025 RECOMMENDATION 2 Apply focused and effective strategies for TB testing in California and optimize treatment for LTBI As stated earlier, advances in LTBI testing and treatment have occurred in the last five years, with more use of IGRAs for testing high risk populations and a greater level of adoption of short-course regimens. Despite advances in LTBI testing and treatment, major barriers remain. A performance quality measure related to LTBI care that can be used at the state or national level is espe - cially needed. If metrics are implemented, they will be a powerful tool for increasing LTBI screening, testing and treatment among community providers in particular. Many of the opportunities for increasing LTBI testing and treatment among high risk populations exist within clini - cal settings. More education of providers about testing and treatment tools as well as increasing understand - ing about the LTBI care cascade steps are key to ensuring higher rates of LTBI testing and treatment completion. It will be important to develop new partnerships among health systems, community providers and health departments to increase the knowledge and skill base of providers. Opportunities exist for both state and local health departments to provide education, consultation and technical assistance to front-line providers. The TB Control Branch is currently developing a TB prevention \"playbook\" which will serve as a guide for primary care clinics and health systems that want to improve their LTBI testing and treatment practices. It will provide a \"how to\" for establishing and improv - ing a TB prevention program and will include strategies for overcoming barriers in each step of the LTBI care cascade. This tool will prove useful for engaged providers and healthcare systems working to improve the outcomes of their TB prevention activities. Required measures for latent TB testing and treatment are crucial to stimulate improvements in health systems.38 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Action Steps to Eliminate TB: 2021-2025Action steps for Recommendation 2 are outlined in the table below. Action Step Proposed Lead(s) and Partner(s) 1.Produce a TB prevention \"playbook\" (which includes steps to assess clinic population risk, increase LTBI testing and treatment and methods for measuring the LTBI care cascade) to at least 10 clinics/health systems serving high risk populations TB Control Branch CITC University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Center for TB Local TB programs Health clinic leadership 2.Develop partnerships with clinics that serve high risk populations to measure and improve their LTBI care cascades TB Control Branch Local TB programs UCSF Center for TB Clinic partners 3.Disseminate steps for linkage to care for LTBI treatment for immigration status adjustors to California civil surgeons TB Control Branch Local TB programs CTCA 4.Implement interventions to improve LTBI treatment outcomes for groups already systematically tested (contacts, B notifications, status adjusters) Local TB programs TB Control Branch 5.Demonstrate the feasibility of coupling LTBI testing, referral and care linkages into the COVID-19 testing/vaccine outreach efforts in communities with TB/COVID TB Control Branch Local TB programs CDPH Immunization Branch 6.Provide technical assistance to Medi-Cal Managed Care plan leaders to implement LTBI testing and treatment quality improvement projects TB Control Branch CA Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) Medi-Cal Managed Care leaders 7.Encourage Medi-Cal Managed Care plan leaders to seek CA DHCS Annual Innovation Awards for its LTBI quality improvement projects TB Control Branch Local TB programs Medi-Cal Managed Care leaders39 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Action Steps to Eliminate TB: 2021-2025 RECOMMENDATION 3 Develop and implement a surveillance system for reporting, tracking and evaluating LTBI in California The first phase of LTBI surveillance was launched in California in 2016. The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) adopted a set of standard criteria that provided a case definition of LTBI.33 In 2018, the federal government revised the Tuberculosis Technical Instructions for Civil Surgeons to require immigration status adjustors diag - nosed with LTBI to be reported to the local health depart - ment.5 In parallel, CDPH began to collect these data sys - tematically through the California Reportable Disease Information Exchange (CalREDIE) Provider Portal. In 2019, the California Code of Regulations Title 17 section 250534 was amended to require electronic reporting by laboratories of LTBI identified by a positive laboratory test. IGRA ELR increased from approximately 1,000 reports per month before mandated laboratory reporting to approximately 5,000 reports per month after. As mentioned above, the draft LTBI metrics to monitor performance will be submitted to CMS for review in 2023. Collectively, these advances set the stage for a future point in time when LTBI surveillance in California will support substantial progress toward TB elimination. Improvements in LTBI reporting will allow California to measure changes in TB infection in the state over time and monitor prevention success. Barriers to implementing a statewide (or national) LTBI surveillance system exist and must be addressed in order to facilitate the targeted TB elimination progress. Most glar - ingly, there is an absence of metrics for quality improvement performance \u2014 meaning, in most primary care settings, the LTBI care cascade cannot be measured, and therefore interventions to improve outcomes cannot be implemented. In addition, LTBI and IGRA data quality is insufficient and specific TB risk factors \u2014 spe- cifically, nativity, race and ethnicity \u2014 are not reported from laboratories via ELR. Further complicating matters is that the state's many health systems do not utilize a universal EHR easily accessible to public health and LTBI reporting is not yet required \u2014 and when it is, it could be cumbersome if all communicable disease programs didn't use the same reporting system. To implement and make use of the needed data fully at the clinic, jurisdiction and state levels, the dissemination of methods and models for assessing data elements of the LTBI care cascade through EHRs is an important next step.40 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Action Steps to Eliminate TB: 2021-2025Action steps for Recommendation 3 are outlined in the table below. Action Step Proposed Lead(s) and Partner(s) 1.Publish an annual LTBI report for California, describing LTBI test positivity and treatment completion rates for high risk populations with required evaluation (refugees, new arrivers, status adjustors and contacts) TB Control Branch 2.Map TB and COVID-19 case overlap to identify hardest hit communities for outreach/testing TB Control Branch Local TB programs 3.Establish statewide LTBI measures and submit measures to the National Quality Forum for endorsement and to the CMS Adult and Child Core Set Workgroup for addition to the Child and Adult Care Measure Set TB Control Branch Medi-Cal Program, CA DHCS 4.Update report on treatment completion rates for Medi-Cal participants with LTBI in California TB Control Branch Medi-Cal Program, CA DHCS CDC Division of TB Elimination 5.Implement a statewide surveillance system to track data on individual contacts to TB cases (LTBI test results and treatment outcomes) TB Control Branch Local TB programs CDPH Division of Communicable Disease Control (DCDC) 6.Enhance ELR of IGRAs to capture individual risk information and negative IGRA results TB Control Branch Local TB programs 7.Create routine transfer of EHR data to CDPH and local health departments from healthcare entities to measure TB prevention testing and treatment TB Control Branch CDPH DCDC Healthcare networks41 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Action Steps to Eliminate TB: 2021-2025 Action Step Proposed Lead(s) and Partner(s) 8.Promote routine measurement of LTBI testing and treatment in AAPCHO's clinic network AAPCHO TB Control Branch California FQHCs 9.Outreach to California health system quality assurance managers at top provider settings to measure USPSTF-recommended LTBI testing TB Control Branch CA DHCS Medi-Cal Managed Care organizations TB program managers Kaiser Permanente AAPCHO California FQHCs42 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Action Steps to Eliminate TB: 2021-2025 RECOMMENDATION 4 Secure sufficient resources for implementing the California TB Elimination Plan, 2021-2025 Successful public health campaigns need sufficient resources to support their actions and partnerships. For TB elimination, new resources to support a number of efforts \u2014 whether they be LTBI surveillance or expanded LTBI testing and treatment \u2014 must become avail - able in both clinical and public health settings. Overall, to support an ambitious move toward TB elimination in California, additional resources are needed to address the gaps that currently exist. Without question, TB prevention in California is under - funded and elimination targets will not be met without additional and more diverse funding sources to scale up LTBI testing and treatment. During 2016-2020, the Pre - ventive Health and Health Services Block Grant was used to fund the TB Free California initiative, a partner - ship led by the TB Control Branch with local TB programs and community partners. Since 2019, some local health departments have also used newly allotted communicable disease funding in 2019/2020 for TB prevention activities. Overall, however, funding for TB prevention is sparse, and streams for new funding need to be identified and secured. These sources, including philanthropy, industry, government and non-governmental health organizations, are needed to support key elimination initia - tive actions. For the greatest impact, multiple sources of prevention dollars, including new ones from the private sector, will help to ensure success of this Elimination Plan. The category \"resources\" does not just imply monetary funding for TB prevention; it includes human resources, as well as tools and skills to increase capacity within a health department, clinic and/or other environment, all of which are vital components needed for a comprehensive effort for TB elimination. Since 2016, reimbursable TB prevention activities in local TB programs and the expansion of healthcare access have created precious new resources which provide opportunities for high risk populations to receive needed TB prevention services.6 However, access is still not fully available to all \u2014 diagnostic work-up (to exclude TB disease) and short-course LTBI regimens, which include rifapentine and rifampin, need to be covered without share of cost by all health plans and must be accessible to both the uninsured and under -Funding streams focused on TB prevention need to be identified and secured.43 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Action Steps to Eliminate TB: 2021-2025insured. Ensuring all plan formularies include rifamycins and policies of no cost-sharing for testing and treatment deserves attention. Acquiring these resources is neces - sary for progressing to pre-elimination in California.TB diagnosis and short-course LTBI regimens still are not fully available to all and need to be made accessible to the uninsured and underinsured. Furthermore, voices to advocate for TB prevention are lacking and the TB prevention and control community needs this advocacy to ensure that the resources for prevention are acquired. The financial and human costs of TB disease are not well known and can be powerfully vocalized by advocates, such as TB survivors and com - munity-based organization representatives that serve populations at risk. Such partners can work together in local and statewide coalitions or as individual partners to local TB programs. A business case for TB prevention is a tool that could complement the needed advocacy voices, yet does not exist in a format that is accessible to decision makers, making the work to secure additional resources challenging. Funders and policy decision makers need to understand the rationale for funding prevention. The rationale is clear: 1) the cost of preventing TB for one person is minimal ($790), whereas the cost for diagnosing and treating one person with active TB disease is substantially higher ($43,900)8 and 2) the costs averted by scaling up prevention and reaching elimination targets earlier are enor - mous (one billion dollars in medical costs and one billion dollars in societal costs). 44 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Action Steps to Eliminate TB: 2021-2025Action steps for Recommendation 4 are outlined in the table below. Action Step Proposed Lead(s) and Partner(s) 1.Define the resources needed for successful implementation of the 2021-2025 California TB Elimination Plan action steps TB Control Branch 2.Develop a \"business case\" that describes the compelling human and economic benefit of preventing TB (LTBI testing and treatment) TB Control Branch UCSF Center for TB Local TB programs Health system leadership 3.Expand California TB coalitions to include leaders and stakeholders of populations most affected by TB Local TB programs CTCA 4.Ensure synergistic efforts and coordination across the four California TB elimination plans TB Control Branch LA, SD, and SF TB programs CTCA 5.Secure funding from philanthropic, industry, governmental and non-governmental health organizations to support key California TB prevention and elimination efforts CTCA State and local TB coalitions TB Control Branch CTEAC 6.Establish routine monitoring of rifamycin inventory and price (through the top California distributors) for early warning of drug supply disruptions TB Control Branch Orange County TB program Other local TB programs CA DHCS 7.Ensure rifamycin LTBI medications are Control DHCS CTCA/California Conference of Local Health Officers (CCLHO)45 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Action Steps to Eliminate TB: 2021-2025 Action Step Proposed Lead(s) and Partner(s) 8.Ensure full cost coverage of IGRAs by all California health plans, including Medi-Cal Managed Care, Covered California and private plans CTCA/CCLHO TB Control Branch CTEAC workgroup 9.Reduce cost-sharing systems CTCA/CCLHO TB Control Branch CTEAC workgroup46 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Action Steps to Eliminate TB: 2021-2025 RECOMMENDATION 5 Conduct research to evaluate TB prevention strategies An additional resource that requires a special focus is LTBI research. Research related to LTBI testing and short-course regimens has been instrumental in improving LTBI testing and treatment rates among various populations. While there has been some promising research on vaccines,7,35,36 as of 2021, there is still no effective vaccine to prevent TB disease. In a multi-site study of the LTBI care cascade, major losses occurred at several key steps, with less than a quarter of at risk patients with LTBI completing treat - ment.37 High quality implementation science related to LTBI is needed to identify strategies to increase the uptake of evidence-supported practices in TB preven-tion. Future work on LTBI implementation science may be informed by U.S.-based research on the HIV care cascade, including data that support use of financial incentives for people living with HIV to increase viral suppression38, as well as studies of value-based payments and performance rankings39 to increase routine vaccination in primary care settings. Research, however, that inves - tigates tailored approaches for specific settings and populations, as well as universal interventions, are both important next steps for California. A cohesive research network in California with a defined research agenda will help advance evidence-based strategies and TB elimination. As of 2021, additional TB pre - vention research is needed to adequately evaluate TB prevention interventions as well as to analyze the data sets which can inform these assessments. A California LTBI research network will be established to prioritize and advance evidence-based strategies and TB elimination.47 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Action Steps to Eliminate TB: 2021-2025Action steps for Recommendation 5 are outlined in the table below.

The timeline out - lines each action step's phased start and completion date, discrete milestones and tempo - ral relationship with each of the other steps. At least annually, the TB Control Branch will monitor the implementation of the Plan and will report on progress made and barriers encountered to CTEAC. It is likely that some of the action step timeframes will be modified during the Plan's five years due to both expected and unexpected implementation barriers. 49 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Implementation TimelineCA TB Elimination Plan, 2021-2025: Implementation Timeline Action Step Timeline Milestones 1.1: Outreach to priority primary care providersStart: 2021 Ongoing2025: Documented outreach to priority primary care providers Engage primary care medical organizationsStart: Create program & award first Heroes 1.4: Partner with health equity organizations Start: 2021 Ongoing2023: 3 health care entities share data showing testing/treatment scale-up 1.5: Implement in 3+ sites; document number of people reached 2024: Outcome data shows patient linkage to care in CHCs 1.6: Tailor communications to high risk populations Start: 2021 Ongoing2022: Disseminate materials to organizations serving high risk populations 1.7: Integrate TB prevention messages into other materials Start: 2021 Ongoing2021: Review materials with partners AANHPI and populations Start: 2025: Annually document number of people reached 1.10: Select and post effective patient materials Start: 2021 Ongoing2021: Post materials on CTCA website50 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Implementation TimelineAction Step Timeline Milestones 2.1: to assess playbook/make modifications 2.2: Improve LTBI care cascades of community clinics Start: 2021 Ongoing2022: 5 primary care clinics and TB programs establish partnerships 2023: Establish LTBI measurement methods for 5 clinical settings 2025: Implement interventions and measure post-intervention data 2.3: Disseminate LTBI linkage End: 20252021: Create linkage to care document 2022: 50% + immigration status adjustors linked to care 2023, 2024, 2025: Disseminate document to civil surgeons 2.4: Increase LTBI treatment of groups already tested Start: mid-2021 Ongoing2025: >50% of tested groups with LTBI complete LTBI and leadership at Managed Care plans 2025: Document data on LTBI testing/ treatment outcomes 2.7: prevention Start: 2022 Ongoing2023: Leadership from 1+ Medi-Cal Managed Care plan applies for award51 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Implementation TimelineAction Step Timeline 3.1: COVID-19 updated surveillance system Start: mid-2022 End: 20252025: Statewide data on contacts available reporting to capture risk Start: mid-2022 End: 20252025: At least 65% of ELR data captures individual risk information 3.7: Create EHR data flow for LTBI surveillance Start: 2022 Ongoing2024: CDPH receives LTBI Promote LTBI testing/ treatment promoting LTBI measurement 2025: Collect cascade data from testing recommendations Start: 2021 healthcare providers with LTBI quality measure(s) 2025: LTBI measurement occurring in 50% of top provider settings52 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Implementation TimelineAction Step Timeline Milestones 4.1: Define TB CDPH TB prevention business case Start: 2021 End: 20212021: Disseminate business case for health system, local TB program and state level use elimination plans Start: 2021 Ongoing2021: Identify unique and common activities across the 4 plans 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025: Monitor implementation progress of plans 4.5: Secure funding to support TB prevention efforts Start: 2021 Ongoing2021: Establish partnerships 2023: Receive funding from 4+ Monitor inventory/ price of rifamycin medications Start: 2021 Ongoing2022: with roles and timelines 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025: Document drug inventory & price 4.8: Ensure full coverage of IGRAs by all CA health plans Start: mid-2021 Ongoing2025: Establish cost reductions for LTBI IGRA testing and treatment 4.9: Reduce TB prevention costs for healthcare systems Start: mid-2021 Ongoing2023: Reduced TB prevention costs for healthcare systems 53 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Implementation TimelineAction Step Timeline Milestones 5.1: Establish CA L TBI research network Start: mid-2021 Ongoing2021: Establish network with specific research priorities 5.2: Establish TB case and disparity reduction targetsStart: 2021 Ongoing2021: mid-2021 Ongoing2022: Initiate research 2025: Distribute findings 5.4: Assess to prevent care cascade attrition Start: mid-2022 Ongoing2024, 2025: Disseminate & share analysis54 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Partners Needed for Tuberculosis Elimination Partners Needed for Tuberculosis Elimination The elimination of TB in California can only occur with a multitude of stakeholders par - ticipating in the implementation of this Plan. As illustrated in the action step tables, which begin on page 32, both lead and partner organizations have been proposed for each action step. TB Control Branch staff and CTEAC mem - bers will outreach to these proposed leads and partners to describe the needed actions and recruit their partic - ipation. An \"all hands on deck\" approach is needed to ensure the full implementation of this Plan and that its successes are sustained. A diverse group of partners are represented in this Plan. Key collaborators include the 61 local TB programs in California \u2014 they are the backbone of TB prevention and control efforts throughout the state. Yet most of these local health departments are understaffed and lack sufficient resources to do what is needed to promote TB preven - tion, particularly since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and therefore need sup - port to implement an array TB prevention efforts. One of the primary functions of the TB Control Branch is to provide consultation, technical assistance, education, training and resources to support local TB programs. The TB Control Branch will be conducting many of the activities outlined in this Plan and will continue to play an important leadership role throughout Plan implementation. Critical to the success of the Plan is the active engagement of community- based orga - nizations which serve populations at high risk for TB. Community leaders often serve as gatekeepers to their communities; they are keenly aware of the unique needs and perspectives of their community members. However, it isn't enough simply to engage the formal leadership of these organizations; community members themselves should participate in TB prevention planning efforts. Ideally, TB survivors, who have unique per-spectives to contribute, play an important role in promoting community engagement and in advocating for TB prevention resources. Furthermore, they often have powerful stories to share, which bring a sharp focus to the \"face of TB\" presented to their communities as well as to policymakers and funders. TB survivors have powerful experiences to share that illustrate why TB prevention is crucial.55 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Partners Needed for Tuberculosis EliminationAdditional partners from other sectors of the wide range of TB elimination stakeholders are needed to participate in facilitating TB elimination in California. These include CTCA, a network of TB public health experts working to prevent and control TB in the state, and an affiliate of the California Conference of Local Health Officers (CCLHO). CTCA is currently building the \"Coalition for a TB-Free California\", which declares a \"TB-free Cal - ifornia\" as its vision. Other important partners include: the California DHCS; other state and national government organizations; community clinics and healthcare systems; and academic researchers. Each of these groups has both overlapping and unique perspec - tives and skills which will contribute to the success of this Plan.56 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025 Evaluation Plan Evaluation Plan An overview of how this Elimination Plan will be evaluated is illustrated in the logic model on the next page. A more detailed plan that identifies data sources and reporting orga - nizations for the specific performance measures for 2025 is provided in Appendix E. In addition, this more extensive plan describes, by Elimination Plan recommendation, the performance measures for each of the action steps. Together, both CTEAC and the TB Control Branch will take the lead to monitor Plan implementation at least once per year. Modifications to the Plan will be made as neces - sary. These assessments, plus any Plan modifications made, will be shared annually with CTEAC members and other TB stakeholders throughout California.CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PLAN, 2021-2025Evaluation Plan 57Elimination Plan Logic Model Barriers Resources Actions 2025 Outcomes Long-Term Outcomes Lack of TB prevention awareness and engagement Lack of patient and provider knowledge about LTBI testing and treatment Lack of statewide LTBI surveillance system and metrics Absence of continuous dedicated resources for TB prevention Insufficient TB prevention research Staff Partnerships Funding Training Technical assistance New technologies Research1.

The 61 local health departments, CDPH, public health associa - tions (e.g., CTCA), community health clinics, academic partners, health plan administrators, community-based organizations, advocacy and patient survivor groups and many others \u2014 as well as the public \u2014 have roles to play. Listed below is a sampling of the many ways the Plan can be supported through diverse partnerships. A number of the actions below, and outlined in the action steps, describe activities already being implemented. Many are not new, but may require intensification to make progress toward elimination in California.An \"all hands on deck\" approach is needed to turn this Elimination Plan into reality.

Glossary of Terms B. Glossary of Abbreviations C. California Tuberculosis Elimination Plan, 2016-2020 \u2014 Selected Achievements D. Participants at December 2020 CTEAC Meeting E. Evaluation Plan67 CALIFORNIA TUBERCULOSIS A: A: Glossary of Terms Asian American (AA): Persons having origins in any of the original peoples of Asia, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example: Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Indonesia, Thailand, or Vietnam. * Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (AANHPI): See entries Asian American (AA), Native Hawaiian (NH) and Pacific Islander (PI).* Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine: A vaccine used to prevent - nated TB disease in children. Use of IGRAs to test for TB infection are preferable for use with BCG-vaccinated individuals to avoid the false positive results that can occur with the TB skin test. California Healthy Families: A low cost insurance program for California children and teens. It provides health, dental and vision coverage to children who do not have insurance and do not qualify for free Medi-Cal. California Reportable Disease Information Exchange (CalREDIE): A com- puter application created by the California Department of Public Health for web-based disease reporting and surveillance. California Tuberculosis Elimination Advisory Committee (CTEAC): Com- prised of TB experts \u2014 including staff from local TB programs, community providers, fed - erally-qualified health centers, TB patient survivors, academic researchers and TB control organizations - this Committee participated in the development of this five-year TB Elim-ination Plan and will monitor its implementation for the state of California. Civil surgeons: Physicians who are designated by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to perform immigration medical examinations of immigrants who are requesting that their immigration status be adjusted. Civil surgeons perform these exam - inations according to the specific technical instructions for different infectious diseases, e.g., TB, syphilis, provided by CDC. Community providers: A general term that refers to a wide range of clinicians that provide care to patients in private settings, e.g., private practice groups, health mainte - nance organizations, community clinics. * It is important to note that communities and individuals may understand and identify with certain racial and ethnic groups differently and change over time.Appendix A: Glossary of Terms68 Glossary of TermsContact investigation: A process performed (usually by health department staff) to identify people who have had contact with a person with TB disease, assess them for LTBI and TB disease, and provide, when appropriate, treatment for LTBI or TB disease. This is a priority activity which is critical for preventing future cases of TB. Federally-qualified health centers (FQHCs): Community-based healthcare clinics that receive federal funds to provide primary care services in underserved areas. Interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA): Whole-blood tests that can aid in diag- nosing M. tuberculosis infection. The tests do not dif ferentiate LTBI from TB disease. Unlike the tuberculin skin test, only a single patient visit is required to conduct the test, results are available in 24 hours and prior BCG vaccination does not cause a false-posi - tive IGRA test result. Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI): Individuals with LTBI carry M. tuberculosis, the organism that causes TB, but do not have TB disease; they are asymptomatic and non-infectious. Individuals with LTBI usually have a positive reaction to the tuberculin skin test and have a positive IGRA blood test. LTBI prevention and care cascade: A care cascade that outlines the discrete steps needed to diagnose and treat people with LTBI. At each step, patients and pre-vention opportunities can be lost, so \"measuring\" a clinic's care cascade allows effective interventions to be implemented to decrease patient attrition at each step. LTBI reservoir: The population of individuals who have LTBI but have not yet pro - gressed to TB disease. Medi-Cal: The Medicaid program in California, administered by the California Depart - ment of Health Care Services. Medi-Cal is a public health insurance program which pro-vides needed healthcare services for low-income individuals. Native Hawaiian (NH): Persons having origins to any of the original peoples of Hawai'i as defined in the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act as \"distinct and unique indigenous people with a historical continuity to the original inhabitants of the Hawaiian archipelago whose society was organized as a Nation prior to the arrival of the first nonindigenous people in 1778\" (42 USC \u00a7 11701(1)). * * It is important to note that communities and individuals may understand and identify with certain racial and ethnic groups differently and change over time.Appendix A: Glossary of Terms69 Glossary of TermsPacific Islander (PI): Pacific Islanders are the distinct and unique indigenous peo- ples descended from the original inhabitants of the nations within Oceania. The Health Resources & Services Administration's Uniform Data System defines Pacific Islanders as those having origins in any of the original peoples of Guam, Samoa, Tonga, Palau, Chuuk, Yap, Saipan, Kosrae, Ebeye, Mel-anesia, or Polynesia. * Status adjustors: Immigrants who are applying to change their immigration status to become lawful permanent residents in the U.S. Surveillance: Ongoing systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of health data essential to the planning, implementation and evaluation of public health practice, closely integrated with the timely dissemination of these data to those who need to know in public health programs. TB elimination: An epidemiologic term defined as <1 TB case per million population. For California in 2020, this translates to an elimination target of 40 annual cases. Tuberculin skin test (TST): A skin test to determine whether a person has LTBI. The test is administered by injection of a small amount of tuberculin fluid under the skin of the forearm. The individual must return within 48 to 72 hours after the test is placed to have a trained healthcare worker look for and measure a reaction on the arm. Tuberculosis (TB): An infectious disease caused by the bacterium M. tuberculosis. The bacteria usually attack the lungs, but TB bacteria can attack any part of the body such as the kidney, spine and brain. If not treated properly, TB disease can be fatal. United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) TB screening recommendation: In 2016, the USPSTF published a recommendation to screen pop- ulations at increased risk for LTBI (B recommendation). * It is important to note that communities and individuals may understand and identify with certain racial and ethnic groups differently and change over time.Appendix A: Glossary of Terms70 Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders AAPCHO ...........
