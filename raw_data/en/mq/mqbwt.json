The new Food and Drug Administration action date for the medicine is March 10, Human Genome and its Benlysta development and marketing partner GlaxoSmithKline [GSK.L](/companies/GSK.L) said on Friday. A decision had been expected by Dec. 9. Such delays are not uncommon and do not necessarily mean there is a problem with the drug, but they are typically frowned upon by the investment community. This case has likely been delayed to give the FDA more time to review additional data for which it asked Human Genome in mid-November. The company said on Friday that it had submitted the data. If approved, Benlysta, known chemically as belimumab, would become the first new lupus treatment to hit the U.S. market in half a century. An FDA expert advisory panel recommended the drug's approval by a vote of 13-2 in November. Analysts expect it to become a multibillion-dollar blockbuster. Lupus, a debilitating and sometimes fatal disease, causes the immune system to attack the body's own tissues and organs. Human Genome shares fell to $24.53 in after hours trading from their Nasdaq close of $25.60.
