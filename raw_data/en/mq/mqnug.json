We reviewed the literature to investigate the potential role of comple-mentary and alternative medicine for this disease. EPIDEMIOLOGY Approximately 72 million adults in the US used some form of complementary and alternative medicine between1997 and 2002. 1The prevalence of its use specifically for glaucoma\u2014including herbal remedies, acupuncture, home-opathy, faith healing, meditation, megavitamin therapy,therapeutic touch, exercise, and dietary modification\u2014isapproximately 5%. 2 MEGAVITAMIN THERAPY Vitamins fulfill essential metabolic roles throughout the body. Vitamin deficiencies have not been shown to con-tribute to glaucoma in humans. 3An analysis of data from the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study found no statistically significant association be-tween the consumption of dietary antioxidants and therisk of primary open-angle glaucoma. 4With the serum osmolarity-altering intra-venous ascorbic acid for acute angle-closure glaucoma, 5 megadoses of vitamins do not benefit patients with glauco-ma. 3At present, there is no scientific evidence for recom- mending megadose vitamin supplements for glaucoma.3 HERBAL REMEDIES Many valuable medications have been derived from plants. Commercial herbal preparations, however, containa nonstandard mixture of many active and inactive com-pounds. By ingesting herbal preparations, one may hope to gain an unrecognized, biologically beneficial compound. Bilberry Current evidence does not support the claim that bil- berry improves night vision or contrast sensitivity. 6,7We were unable to identify any studies alluding to an effecton IOP or the visual field. 3 Chinese Herbs In animals, many Chinese herbal products improve reti- nal and choroidal circulation8-10and facilitate retinal recov- ery after ischemic insult.11,12The effects on human glauco- ma, however, are unknown.3No severe adverse effects have been reported for Chinese herbal preparations that havebeen tested for ocular blood flow. 3 Marijuana (Cannabis) Inhaled marijuana lowers the IOP by an average of 25%13in 60% to 65% of people.14In one patient, the mechanism was through increased uveoscleral outflow.15 Cannabinoids may also significant sys- temic toxicity and short half-life of 3 to 4 hours13make it a poor treatment option, newer topical cannabinoidshave shown promise in animal and human studies. 16 Ginkgo Biloba) Ginkgo cataract action in a murine model.17Ginkgo extract mild- ly increased blood flow through the ophthalmic artery innormal subjects (n = 11), 18but its clinical relevance in glaucoma is unclear.19Complementary and Alternative Medicine for Glaucoma A review of the literature. BY MOSES B. GRAUBARD; LOUIS R. PASQUALE, MD; CYNTHIA L. GROSSKREUTZ, MD, P HD; TERESA C. CHEN, MD; AND DOUGLAS J. RHEE, MD40IG L A U C O M A T O D A YI SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 2006THERAPEUTICS UPDATE A recent, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover trial (n = 27) showed a statisticallysignificant improvement in visual fields in patients withnormal-tension glaucoma after 4 weeks of treatment withginkgo extract. 20The short duration of the study, however, does not provide information on how long ginkgo's effectswill last or if the findings were simply long-term fluctua-tion artifacts. It is also unclear how much ginkgo's abilityto improve cognitive functioning in some patients mayhave contributed to the improved performance on visualfield tests in the intervention group. 21Further investigation that takes into account the effects of ginkgo on the visualfield, optic nerve characteristics, and ocular blood flow iswarranted. 20Clinicians should note that, due to ginkgo's antiplatelet activity, it is recommended that the extract beavoided in patients on anticoagulant therapy. 22,23 To summarize, although some herbal preparations show promise for the treatment of glaucoma, there is nodefinitive evidence for their use at this time. More com-prehensive reviews have been examined that discussadditional herbal remedies as well. 3,14,24,25 DIET Food contains nutrients important in the causation, prevention, and amelioration of disease. By altering thetype or quantity of food, one may change the balancebetween beneficial and harmful factors. In mice, a calo-rie-restricted diet was protective against glaucoma. 26A direct comparison between the body mass indices ofpatients with and without glaucoma, however, found nostatistically significant difference. 27,28In fact, the evalua- tion revealed a trend that was not significant towardlower body mass indices in glaucoma patients. Similarly, there is no independent association between the intakeof major fats and fat subtypes and the risk of primaryopen-angle glaucoma. 29Thus, there is no definitive evi- dence, at this time, that diet or obesity plays a role in thepathogenesis or treatment of glaucoma in humans. EXERCISE Regular exercise improves cardiovascular fitness and can lower systemic blood pressure. Because systemic hyperten-sion is often cited as a risk factor for glaucoma, 30,31one may hypothesize that regular exercise could modify this risk. Exercise can cause an immediate elevation and subse- quent decline of IOP to below baseline.32-34In normal eyes, autoregulation during exercise seems to maintain a consis-tent rate of blood flow to the optic nerve. 32It is unknown whether glaucomatous eyes have similar abilities. Chronicexercise probably contributes to a modest lowering (1 to 2 mm Hg) of IOP 35-39in one-third of normal eyes,36although one study reported as much as a 4-mm Hg lowering effect.40On the other hand, one cautionary report described three young adults with advanced glaucomatous opticneuropathy who had exercise-induced visual loss, possi-bly due to a vascular steal phenomenon. 41Despite this hypothetical risk, it appears that regular exercise can bemildly effective in lowering IOP in some people. Thereare obviously many additional health-related reasons tomaintain a regular exercise regimen. ACUPUNCTURE Acupuncture is based on the belief that health is deter- mined by a balanced flow of vital life energy (called qior chi) present in all living organisms. By inserting fine needles justunder the skin at certain points on the body, an acupunctur-ist attempts to rebalance the flow of energy to treat disease.A study in dogs with experimentally induced glaucomademonstrated a decrease in IOP following acupuncture. 42A study in rats with induced glaucoma claimed to show a neu-roprotective effect of electroacupuncture at 2 but not 100 Hz, as measured by multifocal electroretinograms. 43The IOP , however, was not similar between the experimental andcontrol groups prior to the initiation of electroacupuncture. Two separate case series of 33 and 18 glaucoma patients found that most reported a subjective improvement in cen-tral visual acuity after acupuncture, 44,45but they experienced no change in IOP45,46or visual field.46These results suggest that either acupuncture may have some effect specifically onmacular function or the intervention group may have expe-rienced a psychological effect that was not detectable by themeasurement of overall visual function. Another case series (n = 11) found a significant im- provement in both IOP and visual acuity after 5 weeks ofacupuncture treatment. 47The effect seemed to diminish after 4 weeks without treatment. It is unclear, however,whether the improvement was real or simply due to anormal variation in IOP and visual acuity. A randomized,placebo-controlled trial is needed to further study thepotential role of acupuncture for glaucoma. MEDITATION Meditation attempts to induce a relaxed state, thereby decreasing people's stress and increasing their voluntarycontrol over autonomic functions. This practice couldpotentially lower systemic blood pressure or IOP orchange blood flow to the optic nerve. There is no evidence that relaxation techniques lower IOP . 3,48,49In fact, a large epidemiological study found a negative correlation between stress and IOP .50This find- ing is consistent with epinephrine's known aqueous sup-pressant and IOP-lowering action. Aside from a potentialpsychological benefit, there is no evidence that medita-tion has a role in the management of glaucoma.SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 2006 IG L A U C O M A T O D A YI 41THERAPEUTICS UPDATE CONCLUSION Complementary and alternative medicine deserves scien- tific scrutiny, because patients with glaucoma can experi-ence progressive visual loss even with appropriate medicaltreatment. Currently, however, there seems to be little evi-dence to support prescribing complementary and alterna-tive medicine for the treatment of glaucoma. In particular,ginkgo biloba, some Chinese herbs, acupuncture, and regu-lar exercise deserve further study. Moreover, some topicalcannabinoids show early pharmacologic promise. Given that effective glaucoma therapies may exert their effects by mechanisms that are not related to IOP (eg, in-creased ocular blood flow), future studies of complementa-ry and alternative medicine should not focus exclusively onIOP but should also take perimetric tests and other objec-tive parameters into account. Further study of alternative therapy not only may discover new treatments, but it alsomay protect our patients from potentially harmful\u2014or atleast economically wasteful\u2014explorations.
