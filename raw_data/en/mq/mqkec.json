WEINBERG, DIRECTOR, MEDICAL ASSISTANCE DIVISION SUBJECTS: I. INCREASE IN PAYMENT RATES FOR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER SERVICES II. VACCINATION REIMBURSE MENT I. INCREASE IN PAYMENTS RATES FOR PRIMARY CARE SERVICES On November 6, 2012, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued final rules to implement requirements for increased Medicaid payment for primary care services provided by certa in practitioners for calendar years 2013 and 2014. The final rule also provided for optional changes in the reimbursement for vaccine administration under the Vaccines for Children program. This supplement serves as notice of the intent of the Medical As sistance Division (MAD) to implement the federal requirements and to provide information and instruction to providers regarding what must be done in order to receive the increased payment . A. EFFECTIVE DATE AND METHOD OF PAYMENT The final rule allows Medica id programs to distribute the increased payment amount on a quarterly basis rather than by increasing the payment made at the time the claim is processed and paid. For the reasons noted on the following page, MAD intends to make payments quarterly based o n quarterly claims data. In all cases, in calculating the payment due to a provider, the payment will be calculated based on the date of service and will not be limited by the date of the initial processing or payment of the claim . The effective date of the increased payment level is January 1, 2013. State of New Mexico Medical Assistance Program Manual Supplement Supplement: 13 -01 2 Beginning with that date of service, claims will be subject to the re -pricing calculation for increased payment to the provider in quarterly payments. Therefore, in all cases providers will be reimbursed at the higher rate, when they qualify for the increased payment, for services with dates of service on and after January 1, 2013. There are several reasons why making quarterly payments is the most reasonable way to implement this change: The federal rule requires providers to complete an \"attestation\" to qualify for the increased payment; but the rule was not finalized in time to have providers attest prior to January 1, 2013. Additiona lly, the attestation will be on going, with payments being made quarter ly for retroactive periods. The federal government has yet to determine what the new payment rates will be for Medicare which provides the basis for the new Medicaid reimbursement amount. CMS must approve each state' s plan for reimbursement and accept th e method for how federal financial participation will be claimed by the state. The plan is due to CMS no later than March 31, 2013. MAD intends to present a plan to CMS that follows the provisions stated in this notice. Prior to submitting that plan, MA D would be glad to receive your comments for consideration as stated at the end of this section of the supplement . The increase in the primary care codes will only be effective upon the approval of the plan submitted to CMS, but will be retroactive to dat es of service beginning January 1, 2013. In the event that any Medicare rate is below the current rates for primary care codes specified in the federal rule, MAD will not lower the payment rates because of the federal rule, but will keep the current Medicaid rate. The federal rule does not require MAD to lower rates to Medicare amounts if Medicaid already has a higher rate for these services. Note that when payment is made to providers for the increased payment, it will be made as a lump sum payment, thr ough Xerox, the Medicaid fiscal agent, for services that were paid by Xerox. The provider s will be notified when the payments will be made and the calculation s will be made available to the provider upon request. Payments will be made to the provider who was originally paid for the claim (the billing provider) even though it is always an individual provider, not a group or clinic, who must qualify for the increased payment. The payment ultimately must be given by the group or Supplement: 13 -01 3 clinic or other billing provider to the qualifying individual provider even if the individual provider is on a salary or under contract to the billing provider. This payment provision is part of the federal law. B. ATTESTATION The federal rule requires that the provider attest to the ir board certification or to the fact that 60% of the volume of their practice paid by Medicaid and Medicaid managed care organizations are for the identified primary care procedure codes and vaccination codes (listed below.) A copy of the attestation for m is attached, and may be completed by the provider in order to be considered for the increased payment . Duplicates may be made by the provider and distributed as needed. Whether a provider participates in the Medicaid fee for service (FFS) program or in one or more Medicaid managed care p rograms (SALUD! or CoLTS), or in both, it is only necessary to send the attestation form to MAD, to the address indicated on the attestation form. Since it is an individual practitioner that qualifies, even if the indiv idual practitioner practices at more than one location or for more than one practice, only one attestation form is required. Each managed care organization will be responsible for making payment to qualifying providers for the increased payment, but MAD w ill be responsible for determining if the provider qualifies. C. HELP COMPLETING THE ATTESTATION FORM A provider may attest to either their board certification or to the fact that 60% of their Medicaid plus M edicaid managed c are practice is for the primary service codes and vaccination codes listed below. When a provider meets the 60% volume, the limitation to board certification or limitation to specific specialties no longer applies. Using a rendering provider's National Provider Identifier ( NPI) number, it is possible for MAD to determine if it appears that a provider meets the 60% volume requirement. A list of those providers that MAD has estimated as possibly qualifying for the increased payment based on the 60% volume requirement will be posted to the MAD website . Prior to completing the attestation form based on the 60% volume requirement, a provider may want to check the MAD website to determine if MAD estimates the provider will qualify based on volume. Supplement: 13 -01 4 It is anticipated the information will be av ailable by February 1 , 2013 under the \"Provider\" section of the MAD website at: http://www.hsd.state.nm.us/mad/ and on the MAD/Xerox web portal at https://nmmedicaid.acs -inc.com/nm/general/home.do D. CONTINUED COMMUNICATION Information and announcements regarding this activity will be place on the MAD/Xerox web portal at https://nmmedica id.acs -inc.com/nm/general/home.do . Check the portal often to remain informed, see when payments are going to be made, and check other updates. E. QUALIFYING PROVIDERS In order to qualify for the primary care payment increase, the provider must be reimbur sed at the fee schedule amounts. That is, a provider whose service is billed as a Federally Qualified Health C enter or a Rural Health Clinic is not subject to the increase d payment because these provi ders are paid encounter rates r ather than at a separat e fee schedule amount per procedure. Practitioners whose reimbursement is included in a facility payment rather than as a separate identifiable paid service do not qualify for the increase. Indian Health Service providers when paid at an OMB rate also do not qualify for increased payments since payments are not made at a fee schedule rate. A qualifying provider must be a physician being paid for the specified primary care procedure codes under the CMS definition of a physician service. A physician exten der (such as a certified nurse practitioner, a certified nurse midwife, a physician assistant, and a pharmacist clinician) working under the direct supervision of a qualifying physician can qualify based on the supervising physician's qualifications. A physician extender in his or her own private practice such as a certified nurse practitioner in independent practice does not qualify for the increased payment , even if in a collaborative arrangement , because of the way the federal law is written. 1. Physicia ns Qualifying as Board Certified The federal rule and guidance supplied by CMS are very specific in stating the certifying boards and organizations as well as the specialties and subspecialties that qualify for the primary care increased payment . Supplement: 13 -01 5 America n Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) Family Medicine , including subspecialties of Adolescent Medicine, Geriatric Medicine, Hospice and Palliative Medicine, Sleep Medicine and Sports Medicine Internal Medicine, including subspecialties of Adolescent Med icine, Adult Congenital Heart Disease, Advanced Heart Failure and Transplant Cardiology, Cardiovascular Disease, Clinical Cardiac Electrophysiology, Critical Care Medicine, Endocrinology. Diabetes and Metabolism, Gastroenterology, Geriatric Medicine, Hemat ology, Cardiology, Medical Oncology, Nephrology, Pulmonary Disease, Rheumatology, Sleep Medicine, Sports Medicine, and Transplant Hepatology. Pediatrics, including subspecialties of Adol escent Medicine, Child Abuse Pediatrics, Developmental -Behavioral Pediatrics, Hospice and Palliative Medicine, Medical Toxicology, Neonatal -Perinatal Medicine, Neurodevelopmental Disabilities, Pediatric Cardiology, Pediatric Critical Care Medicine, Pediatr ic Emergency Medicine, Pediatric Endocrinology, Pediatric Gastroenterology, Pediatric Hematology - Oncology, Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Pediatric Nephrology, Pediatric Pulmonology, Pediatric Rheumatology, Pediatric Transplant Hepatology, Sleep Medicine, and Sports Medicine. American Osteopathic Association (AOA). Family Physicians (No subspecialties) Rheumatology. Pediatrics , including subspecialties of Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine, Neonatology, Pediatric Allergy/immunology, Pediatric Endocrinology, and Pediatric Pulmonology. American B oard of Physician Specialties (ABPS) The ABPS does not certify subspecialists. Therefore, eligible certifications are: American Board of Family Medicine Obstetrics; Board of Certification in Family Practice; and Board of Certification in Internal Medi cine. Supplement: 13 -01 6 2. Physicians Who Are Not Board Certified in the Specifically Identified Specialties May Qualify Based on Volume Physicians who are not board certified in the specifically identified specialties may still qualify for the increased primary care paymen t if 60% of their combined Medicaid and Medicaid managed care practice is for the primary care codes identified by CMS (listed below) . This qualification is determined to be met when the number of the procedure codes and vaccination codes describe d below is at least 60% of all paid procedure codes for that physician. The rendering provider NPI in the rendering provider field on a claim is used to identify the physician. 3. Physician Extenders A physician extender (Certified Nurse Practitioner, Certified Nurse Midwife, Clinical Nurse Specialist, Physician Assistant, or Pharmacist Clinician) may qualify when they are the rendering provider on claims and are identified with their own NPI number. In order to qualify, they must be under the direct supervision of a physician who qualifies, either on the basis of the board certification or by meeting the volume requirement. F. APPLICABLE PRIMARY CARE PROCEDURE CODES The federal rule is very specific about the CPT procedure codes that are consider ed \"primary care\" codes and would therefore be used in the 60% calculation. They are: Outpatient and Other Visit codes (covered by Medicare) New 7 The federal rule also extends to codes that are not covered by Medicare, for which CMS will calculate Medicare- like rates for states to use. Medicaid programs are not required to cover codes on the list that are not already benefits of the Medicaid program. They are: Preventative Medicine Visits New Patient Preventative Medicine Visits (covered only as EPSDT screenings): 99381, 99382, 99383, 99384, and age 20). Codes 99386 and 99387 are not covered by Medicaid. Established Pat ient Preventative Medicine Visits (covered only as EPSDT screenings): 99391, 99392, 99393, 99394, and age 20). Codes 99396 and 99397 are not covered by Medicaid. Counseling Factor Risk Reduction and Behavior Change Interventi on Codes 99401 through 99412 and code 99429 are not covered by the Medicaid program. Code 99420 is covered by the Medicaid program. E&M Non Face to Face Codes 99441 through 99442 are not covered by the Medicaid program. G. PAYMENT PROCESS The following steps lead to increased payment to the provider: The eligible individual provider or his or her representative complete s the attestation form and mail s the form to the MAD address indicated on the form. MAD sends a form letter to the provider acknowledgi ng receip t of the form and stating if the provider is deemed qualified for the payment increase. MAD maintains a list of qualifying providers and shares that list with managed care organizations . When CMS finalizes the new rates for the preventative code s, the rates will be posted on the MAD website . MAD will use the higher of either the existing Medicaid rate or Supplement: 13 -01 8 the 2013 Medicare or CMS determined rate to calcula te the increased payments ; no additional payment will be due for codes for which the Medicai d rate is higher than the Medicare rate. The additional reimbursement the provider receives will be the difference between the Medicaid rate for a procedure code and the 2013 Medicare rate, or the CMS determined rate for services not covered by Medicare. Following approval of the Medicaid plan by CMS, for FFS claims, MAD will accumulate all the paid claims for the qualifying providers for dates of service January 1 through March 31, 2013, and will calculate the increased amount owed to the provider on eac h claim line . The payment is not limited to the amount billed by the provider . The provide is due the increased amount even if the billed amount on the claim is less than the Medicare or CMS determined amount. When Medicaid payment is for a co -insuranc e, deductible, or copayment, rather than payment for the specific procedure code at the fee schedule payment rate, the increased payment is not made. The billing provider s will be notified of the date the payment will be made. The payment will appear as a single line payment on the billing provider's remittance advice from Xerox. The provider may request a report showing how the payment amount was calculated and may dispute the calculation. If the dispute cannot be resolved the provider does have the ri ght to an administrative hearing. See NMAC 8.353.2 Provider Hearings . H. OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT Questions and comments on this process may be directed to Ellen Maestas -Waller in the Program Policy and Integrity Bureau at : Ellen Maestas -Waller Medical Assistance Division - Human Services Department P.O. Box 2348 Santa Fe, New taken through Febr uary 21 , 2013. Providers will be informed of any changes made based on the comments received. The comments received will be made available to interested parties upon request. II. VACCINE ADMINISTRATION FEES A. Vaccine Administration Fees in the Vaccines fo r Children Program The federal rule regarding vaccines differs from the federal rule for primary care codes, item I, in a number of ways. The main difference is that a Medicaid program is not required to increase the payment for 2013 and 2014. However, MAD is proposing to increase the vaccine administration rates on a per - vaccine basis (not a per -antigen or per -component basis) to the regional limit cap rate which at this time appears to be $20.80. This change would be effective March 1, 2013 and will a pply to the first or only component of each vaccine represented by the following codes: 90460 (formerly and all the other above listed codes wil l be paid for each administration of a vaccine even if given on the same day as other vaccines. The provider may bill the appropriate code above for each administration of a vaccine. Because the $20.80 is a maximum per injection (or oral administration), the code 90461 will be paid at $0.00 since it should represent the additional components in a single injection that was included in the billing of code 90460. If a provider administers more than one injection on the same day, the provider may bill the appropriate code 90460 or 90471 through 90474 for each injection and thus be assured of a payment of $20.80 (or up to the billed amount) for each administration. It is anticipated that the financial impact of this change will result in an additional $90,000 paid to providers annually. B. Vaccine Administration for other than the Vaccines for Children Program Supplement: 13 -01 10 In order to equalize the vaccine administration fee schedule for all vaccine administration s, MAD is proposing to raise the payment rate for the foll owing codes from $10.97 to $20.80 effective March 90460 90471 90472 90473 90474 Because the $20.80 is a maximum per injection (or oral administration), the code 90461 will be paid at $0.00 since it should represent the additional components in a single injection that is included in the billing of code 90460. MAD would also allow pharmacies to be paid for vaccine administration at $20.80 when administration is by a qualified pharmacist for recipient s 18 years of age and above. Questions and comments on change s associated with vaccination reimbursement may be directed to Freddie Gatewood in the Program Policy and Integrity Bureau at: Freddie Gatewood Medical Assistance Division - Human Services Department P.O. Box 2348 Santa Fe, New M exico 87504- 2348 Phone: (505) 827- 7797 Email: Freddie.Gatewood@state.nm.us Comments will be taken through February 21, 2013. Providers will be informed of any changes made based on the comments receive d. Any claims affected by a change will be reprocessed by Xerox with no action required on the part of the provider. The comments received will be made available to interested parties upon request. It is anticipated that the financial impact of this cha nge will result in an additional $20,000 paid to providers annually If you have questions regarding the above information, you may contact the Medicaid Program Policy and Integrity Bureau at (505) 827 -3171.
