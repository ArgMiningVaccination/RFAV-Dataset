A copy of the authorizing statute signed into law in 1985 is provided in Appendix A. The protocol contains step-by-step procedures for conducting examinations of the adult female, adult male, p9diatric patient, and suspect. Each section is designed to stand alone; however, evidence collection and preservation procedures common to every patient are included in a specia; section. Flow charts are also provided. OCJP 923, Medical Report: Suspected Sexual Assault, used for recording the findings of evidential examinations, has been revised to guide the examination. OCJP 925, Medical Report: Suspected Child Sexual Abuse, is a new form that has been developed to record findings for child sexual abuse examinations. The numbered and lettered sections of the protocol correspond to the numbered and lettered sections of the forms.

STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS 1. State Office of Criminal Justice Planning Penal Code Section 13823.5 directs the Office of Criminal Justice Planning (OCJP) to establish a protocol for the examination and treatment of sexual assault victims, including child molestation, and the collection and preservation of evidence. The statute requires the protocol to contain recommended methods for meeting the minimum standards for evidential examinations specified in Penal Code Section 13823.11. In addition lto the protocol, the statute mandates the Office to develop an informational guide that contains general reference informa\u00ad tion on evidence collection and medical and psychological treatment for sexual assault victims. OCJP also has the statutory authority, in cooperation with the Department of Health Services and the Department of Justice, to develop a standard form (s) for recording findings from evidential examinations. 2. All county and general acute care hospitals Every physician or health care profE~ssional who conducts an examination for evidence of sexual assault or child sexual abuse is required to use OCJP 923, Medical Report: Suspected Sexual I\\ssault or OCJP 925, Medical Report: Sus\u00ad pected Child Sexual Abuse. Copies of the forms are included for reference on pages 27 -38. See Appendix B for information on ordering supplies. Health and SafetY Code Section 1281 and Penal Code Section 13823.9 require all public and general acute care hospitals to comply with the standards set forth in Penal Code Section 13823.11, the protocol, and the guidelines. If a hospital cannot adhere to the statutory requirements, a protocol must be adopted for immediate referral of sexual assault and child sexual abuse victims to a local hospital that is able to conduct the evidential examination according to the standards estab\u00ad lished by law. If a referral protocol is adopted, the hospital must notify local law enforcement agencies, the district attorney, and local victim assistance agencies. Each county is directed to designa.te at least one general acute care hospital to perform examinations for sexual assault and child sexual abuse victims. The statute also requires each county with a population of 100,000 or more to arrange to have professional personnel, trained in the examination of sexual assault and child sexual abuse victims, present or on call in the county hospital providing emergency medical services. General acute care hospitals that contract with .~ounties to provide emergency medical services are also subject to this require\u00ad ment. In counties with populations of 1,000,000 or more, trained professional personnel must be present or on call for at least one general acute care hospital per 1,000,000 persons in the county. B. LOCAL AGREEMENTS Local agreements between hospitals and law enforcement agencies designating primary and alternative examination sites should be developed to ensure prompt evidential examinations and treatment for victims. Reimbursement of hospitals for evidential examinations is the responsibility of local government. Development of local fee standard agreements that can be negotiated periodically is also recommend\u00ad ed. The statutory provision requiring all general acute care hospitals to comply with the minimum standards or adopt a referral protocol is intended to ensure consistent procedures among hospitals. The legislative intent is to support, not modify, local 1 agreements in those counties that have established centralized sexual trauma centers for referral of a\" sexual assault victims. These centers have a recognized value in ensuring consistent and advanced standards of professional care. C. RECOMMENDED METHODS FOR CONDUCTING EVIDENTIAL EXAMINATIONS The protocol contains recommended methods for meeting the statutory standards. Flexibility is needed, however, to accomplish these tasks as circumstances may vary and new methods may evolve with advancing technology and research. The important considerations are whether alternate methods support quality medical examinations, evidence collection and preservation procedures, law enforcement investigation, and case prosecution; and whether these methods are consistent with local law enforce\u00ad ment and crime laboratory policies. 2 SECTION I NOTIFICATION OF INJURIES TO AUTHORITIES A. SEXUAL ASSAULT 1. Report crime-related injuries to the local law enforcement agency Hospitals and physicians are required to report to the local law enforcement agency all cases in which medical care is sought where injuries have been inflict\u00ad ed upon any person in violation of any state penal law. The report must be made by telephone and in writing. It must state the name of the injured person, if known, the current whereabouts, and the character and extent of injuries. (Penal Code Sections 11160-11161) 2. Criminal penalties for failure to report injuries to authorities The failure of a hospital or physician to report cases where injuries have been inflicted in violation of a state penal law is punishable by a fine not to exceed $500, by imprisonment in the county jail for a period not to exceed six months, or both.

(Penal Code Sections 11165-11168) 2. Criminal penalties fol' failure to report child abuse The failure of medical practitioners and other mandated persons to report child abuse is punishable by a fine not to exceed $1,000, by imprisonment in the county jail for a period not to exceed six months, or both.

See the State of California Medical Protocollnforma\u00ad tional Guide for recommendations on establishing confidential files for evidential examination records. 5. Immunity from civil or crimina.l liability for complying with the child abuse reporting law a. Medical practitioners and others required to report known or suspected child abuse cannot be held civilly or criminally liable for any report required or authorized by the child abuse reporting law. (Penal Code Section 11172) b. Physicians and hospitals may be held liable for injuries sustained by a child for failure to diagnose and report child abuse to authorities resulting in the child being returned to the parents and receiving further injuries by them (Landeros v. Flood, (1976) 131 CAL.RPTER 69, 551 P.2d 389,17 C.3d 399,97 A.L.A. 3d 324). 6. Confidentiality I child abuse reports a. Written reports required by the child abu$e reporting law are confidential and can only be released to child protective agencies. Any violation of confiden\u00ad tiality is punishable by up to six months in jail, by a fine of $500, or both. (Penal Code Section 11167.5) b. At this time, Penal Code Section 11167.5 does not distinguish between public and parental access to child abuse records. Consult with the county prosecu\u00ad tor's office or an attorney to determine the appropriate course of action if the person seeking access to the evidential examination records is the parent or guardian suspected of the abuse. 5 ---------~ SECTION II PATIENT CONSENT FOR EXAMINATION, TREATMENT, AND EVIDENCE COLLECTION A. ADULTS To protect the rights and interests of both the adult patient and the hospital, appropri\u00ad ate signed consents must be obtained before examination, treatment, and evidence collection begins. 1. Consent to medical examination and treatment only a. General consent jlor routine diagnostic and medical procedures, informed consent for more complex procedures, and consent for emergency treatment should be obtained in accordance with hospital policy. b. At the onset of the consent interview, the patient must be informed that examination and treatment for injuries inflicted in violation of any state penal law obligates the hospital to make a telephone and written report to the local law enforcement agency. c. If the patient consents to examination and treatment only, OCJP 923 (Part B, Item # 1) must be signed to indicate the patient understands the legal re\u00ad quirement to report crime-related injuries to law enforcement authorities. 2. Consent to medical examination, collection, and preservation of evidence a. If the patient consents to the medical examination for collection of evidence, OCJP 923 (Part B, Item #2) must be signed. This indicates the patient understands that evidence will be collected, preserved, and released to law enforcement authorities. b. Patients must be given the following information: (1) Patients have the right to refuse an examination for the purpose of collecting evidence. (2) The cost of an evidential examination is the responsibility of local gov\u00ad ernment only if the patient consents to the collection of evidence. (Pe\u00ad nal Code 13823.95) If the patient does not consent to evidence collection, the patient is responsible for the costs of the medical exami\u00ad nation. If the patient has agreed to collection of evidence, hospitals are prohibited by law from directly or indirectly charging the sexual assault victim for the cost of the evidential examination. (3) County hospitals must provide testing for venereal disease and preg\u00ad nancy without charge. (Health and Safety Code Section 1491) {4} Consent for evidence collection, once given, can be withdrawn at any time for all or part of the examination. (5) Patients have the right to refuse the collection of reference specimens, such as pubic and head hair strands, blood for typing and alcohol deter\u00ad mination, or saliva for ABO secretor status. (6) If the patient does not permit collection of reference specimen (s), at the time of the examination or at a later date, the crime laboratory cannot conduct a comparative analysis of the evidence in question. 7 (7) Physical evidence deteriorates and will be unobtainable if not collected and preserved promptly. 3. Consent to photograph suspected trauma a. If the patient consents to evidence collection, a separate written consent must be obtained for photographs of injuries and the genital area. b. If the patient consents to having photographs taken, OCJP 923 (Part 8, Item #3) must be signed. This indicates the patient understands that photographs may be used as evidence. 4. Collection of evidence without immediate release to the law enforcement agency Patients uncertain about whether to consent to an evidential examination may not be able to make this decision immediately. If the hospital has a policy and the capability of storing evidence frozen, patients may be encouraged with this infor\u00ad mation to consent to have evidence collected at the time and released later-with their permission-to law enforcement authorities. B. MINORS 1. Consent to treatment a. Minors, 12 years of age or older, may give consent to the provision of hospital, medical, and surgical care related to the diagnosis or treatment of a sexual assault and the collection of evidence. Such consent is not subject to disaffir\u00ad mance because of minority. (Civil Code Section 34.9) b. Minors, 12 years of age or older, may give consent to the provision of hospital, medical, and surgical care related to the prevention or treatment of preg\u00ad nancy. Such consent is not subject to disaffirmance because of minority. (Civil Code Section 34.5) c. Minors, 12 years of age or older, may give consent to the provision of hospital, medical, and surgical care related to the diagnosis or treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. Such consent is not subject to disaffirmance because of minority. (Civil Code Section 34.7) 2. Notification of parents Prof~ssional personnel rendering medical treatment for a sexual assault are required to attempt to contact the parent(s) or legal guardian of the minor, and to note in the minor's treatment record the date and time the attempted contact was made and whether the attempt was successful or unsuccessful. This provi\u00ad sion is not applicable when the professional person reasonably believes the parent(s) or guardian of the minor committed the sexual assault on the minor. (Civil Code Section 34.9(b\u00bb C. CHILDREN/MINORS 1. Child sexual abuse: consenting parents Parents or guardians may initiate and authorize the request for examination, treatment, and evidence collection by Signing OCJP 925 (Part A). Payment for an evidential examination at public expense can only be authorized by a child protec\u00ad tive agency (law enforcement, the county department of social services, or coun\u00ad ty probation department). 8 2. Suspected child abuse: non consenting parents Parental consent is not required to examine, treat, or collect evidence for suspect\u00ad ed child abuse. In the absence of parental consent or in case of parental refusal, children must be taken into protective custody by a child protective agency. A representative of the child protective agency must sign OCJP 925 (Part 8) as the temporary guardian of the child to authorize the procedures. 3. Photographs of injuries Skeletal x-rays or photographs may be taken of known or suspected child abuse victims and included with reports to child protective agencies without parental consent. (Penal Code Sections 11171 and 11172) 4. Adolescent voluntary sexual activity Iparental demand for examination Cases in which parents request an evidential examination to determine whether their child has been sexually active and allege violation of Penal Code Section 261.5 (Unlawful Sexual Intercourse with a Female Under Age 18) require sensitive handling. Consult with local law enforcement agencies and follow local pOlicies. A referral for family counseling should be provided to avoid examination of pa\u00ad tients who do not consent to the' examination, D. PERSONS ARRESTED FOR SUSPEC:TED SEXUAL ASSAULT Hospitals are not required by law to perform suspect examinations and no obligation is implied by the inclusion of this material in the protocol. There is no civil or criminal immunity from liability for performing these examinations. Hospitals are encouraged to assist law enforcement investigations if called upon and local agreements are recommended. 'I. Voluntary examina~ions Persons suspected of sexual assault or child sexual abuse may voluntarily con\u00ad sent to an evidential examination. If consent is given, OCJP 923 (Part 8, Item #2) must be signed. Hospitals may want to consider a separate consent form de\u00ad signed for this purpose. 2. Involuntary examinations Persons who have been placed under arrest do not have the right to refuse an examination for the collection of physical evidence. Case law defining \"search incident to arrest\" permits the search of an arrested person for evidence relevant to the crime for which they are suspected. If the suspect is in custody and is unwilling to consent to the examination, evidence such as dried secretions, for\u00ad eign materials, and blood/alcohol can be collected from his person without a search warrant and without his consent if the law enforcement officer believes the delay necessary to obtain a court order would result in the possible loss or destruction of evidence. 3. Reimbursement for examinations Examinations at public expense of persons suspected of sexual assault must be authorized by a law enforcement agency. 9 ----------r I , SECTION III FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR EXAMINATION, TREATMENT, AND TESTING A. HOSPITAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR EXAMINATIONS 1. Medical examination with evidence collection No costs incurred by a physician, hospital, or other emergency medical facility for the examination of a sexual assault victim, when the examination is conducted for the purposes of gathering evidence for possible prosecution, shall be charged directly or indirectly to the victirp. To qualify for reimbursement, examinations must be performed in accordance with the State of California Medical Protocol for Examination of Sexual Assault and Child Sexual Abuse Victims developed by OCJP pursuant to Penal Code Sections 13823.5 and 13823.7. a. If the examination is provided at a county or city hospital, or hospital district facility, the county must pay the expenses. b. If the examination is performed at a private hospital or in the office of a physician, the expenses must be paid by the local governmental agency in whose jurisdiction the alleged offense was committed. c. Bills for these costs must be submitted to the law enforcement agency that requests the ex~mination. . d. The law enforcement agency that requests the examination has the option of determining whether or not the examination will be performed in the office of the physician. {Penal Code Section 13823.95} 2. Medical examination without evidence collection If the patient does not consent to evidence collection, the cost of the examination is the responsibility of the patient. B. MEDICAL TREATMENT Medical expenses for treatment of injuries resulting from a sexual assault are the responsibility of the patient. Victims of sexual assault can be reimbursed for out-of\u00ad pocket medical expenses by submitting an Application for Crime Victim Compensation to the State Board of Control. See Crime Victim Compensation/Victim Assistance Programs (page 13) C. TESTING FOR SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE (STD) AND PREGNANCY County hospitals must provide victims of rape or sexual assault with testing for vene\u00ad real disease and pregnancy without charge. (Health and Safety Code Section 1491) 11 SECTION IV CRIME VICTIM COMPENSATION/VICTIM ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS A. CRIME VICTIM COMPENSATION 1. Display of posters in emergency rooms Licensed hospitals in the state of California must prominently display posters in the emergency room notifying crime victims of the availability of victim compensa\u00ad tion and the existence and location of local victim assistance centers. (Govern\u00ad ment Code Section 13968) 2. Provision of crime victim compensation claim forms County hospitals must provide Application for Crime Victim Compensation forms to sexual assault victims. (Health and Safety Code Section 1492) 3. Reimbursable expenses Victims of violent crime must be informed they are eligible to receive up to $46,000 for out-of-pocket medical expenses for treatment of injuries resulting from the crime, lost wages, and job retraining and rehabilitation. Expenses for psychologi\u00ad cal counseling are also reimbursable. Persons requiring legal assistance\u00b7 in filing claims may receive up to $500 for attorney's fees. 4. Assistance in filing claims Additional information on crime victim compensation may be obtained by contact\u00ad ing local victim/witness programs or the State Board of Control Victim's of Crime Program. Local victim/witness programs provide assistance to victims in the preparation and submission of these claims to the State Board of Control. B. CRIME VICTIM ASSISTANCE CENTERS Rape crisis centers, victim/witness programs, domestic violence shelters, child sexual abuse treatment programs, and special crime victim counseling centers exist in Cali\u00ad fornia to provide counseling and other forms of assistance to crime victims. Many rape crisis centers also provide training to medical personnel on the psychological reac\u00ad tions and needs of sexual assault victims. See the State of California Medical Protocol Informational Guide for a list of programs. 13 SECTION V GENERAL PATIENT CARE Immediate comprehensive medical care that includes treatment for psychological trauma is critical to alleviate the emotional as well as physical trauma of a sexual assault. Psycho\u00ad logical interventions should be incorporated into the approaches used to accomplish the medical examination and evidence collection procedures. Sensitive medical care can: Reduce acute psychological trauma and its aftereffects; Support existing and emerging coping skills; and Set the tone for resumption of normal functioning. The following general guidelines are designed to help practitioners assist patients to regain feelings of safety, control, trust, autonomy, and self-esteem. See the State of California' Medical Protocol Informational Guide for specific information unique to the type of patient (e.g., female, male, adult, or child). A. EXAMINER'S APPROACH TO PATIENTS 1. Prior to the examination a. Provide privacy for patients promptly upon arrival and during all aspect~ of care. The examination should be conducted as soon as possible for their emotional well-being and to prevent loss of evidence. If delays occur, provide an explanation to alleviate stress caused by waiting. b. Introduce yourself to patients and apprise them of your role. c. Ask patients how they want to be addressed and refer to them by that name. d. Provide a trained support person to accompany and guide patients through the entire medical process. Sexual assault victims should never be left alone, unless they request it. e. Privately inquire of patients if the presence of a friend, relative, or victim assistance person is desired. f. Approach and respond to patients in a supportive, nonjudgmental manner. 2. During the examination a. Explain throughout the examination what is being done and why, as well as the reasons for questions asked. Inform patients of findings regarding their physical condition as the examination is conducted. b. Ask only what is necessary to collect evidence and to complete a thorough examination. Build rapport and lead gradually to sensitive questions. c. Use terminology clearly understood by patients in referring to sexual acts and parts of the body. d. Avoid the appearance of prurient interest or questions about a patient's reasons or motivation such as \"Why did you do that?\" e. Patients may exhibit a range of emotional states from outward calm to fearful\u00ad ness, anxiety, or hysteria. Accept and respond to these responses as an individual's adaptation to a personal crisis. 1. Encourage patients to express feelings, concerns, and needs related to the assault. g. Explicitly acknowledge the sexual assault and its traumatic nature. 15 h. Involve patients of appropriate age in decision-making regarding treatment, follow-up care, and notification of family members or others. i. Provide patients with age-appropriate information regarding physical and psy\u00ad chological sequelae to sexual assault. B. PATIENT COORDINATOR A patient coordinator should be assigned to supervise the treatment of sexual assault victims in the emergency department. The coordinator may be a nurse, social worker, physician, or person from a crisis intervention team. Suggested responsibilities of the patient coordinator are: 1. During the examination a. Ensure the medical examination is conducted promptly and the protocol is followed according to the standards set forth in this document. b. Ensure the reporting requirements to'law enforcement and/ or child protective agencies are followed when injuries have been inflicted upon adults or chil\u00ad dren in violation of state penal laws. c. Explain to patients the steps of the protocol and the reasons for the proce\u00ad dures. d. Ensure patients receive psychological support. e. Notify and serve as liaison with families and friends, and provide psychologi\u00ad cal support tb them. 2. Following the examination a. Arrange follow-up care for treatment of injuries, sexually transmitted disease, and pregnancy. b. Provide information about crime victim compensation for reimbursement of out-of-pocket medical expenses, lost wages, psychological counseling, and job retraining and rehabilitation services. c. Provide referrals to local rape crisis centers, child sexual abuse treatment programs, victim/witness programs, available psychological counseling re\u00ad sources, and other needed services. d. Arrange transportation for patients when needed. e. Monitor civil and criminal court subpoenas to ensure patient privacy rights are not violated. 16 e SECTION VI SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE COLLECTION AND PRESERVATION OF EVIDENCE The following information pertains to all patients (female, male, adult, or child). 80th OCJP 923 (used to record findings for sexual assault examinations) and OCJP 925 (used to record findings for child sexual abuse examinations) are referenced. A. COLLECTION OF EVIDENCE Failure to follow proper and prompt collection and preservation procedures can affect the value of evidence and its admissibility in court. General guidelines are listed below. 1. Within 72 hours of incident If the incident (s) occurred within 72 hours, patients should be examined without delay to minimize the loss or deterioration of evidence. A complete evidential examination that meets the minimum standards estaiilished by Penal Code Sec\u00ad tion 13823.11 must be conducted concurrently with the physical examination. This protocol contains the recommended methods for meeting these standards. See Appendix A for a copy of the penal code section. 2. More than 72 hours after incident If more than 72 hours have passed since the last incident (s) , a complete physical examination should still be conducted to examine for injuries to the body and genitalia. A modified evidential examination may be indicated as the prospect of recovering evidence diminishes after time. For example, pubic hair combings or a Wood's Lamp scan for dried or moist secretions are not likely to yield findings. Based on sperm survival data, however, there may be value in collecting vaginal or cervical samples. See Examination of Vagina and Cervix, Adult Female Patient (page 48). B. LABELING 1. Label information All items of evidence, including laboratory specimens, must be clearly marked with the: Full name of the patient; Name of the hospital and the patient identification number; Date and time of evidence collection; Description of evidence including the location from where it was collected; and Name and signature of the person who collected the evidence and placed it in the container. 2. Addressograph machines Many emergency departments use addressograph machines to expedite labeling evidence. C. CHAIN OF CUSTODY 1. Documentation of custody a. Handling and transfer of custody of evidence must be carefully documented to show no breaks in the chain of custody or chain of possession have occurred. 17 Proper documentation ensures there has been no alteration or loss of evi\u00ad dence prior to trial. b. All transfers of custody of evidence must be logged with the following infor\u00ad mation: the name of the person transferring custody, the name of the person receiving custody, and the date and time of the transfer. Transfers should be kept to a minimum, ideally one or two persons. The chain of custody informa\u00ad tion can be printed on or attached to an evidence envelope, or special en\u00ad velopes can be printed with the form on them. See Appendix C for an example of proper sealing of chain of custody envelopes and a chain of custody form: 2. Release to law enforcement Evidence is turned over to law enforcement officers after the examination has been completed and the saliva reference samples, swabs, and slides have been completely dried. D. PRESERVATION OF EVIDENCE 1. Air drying a. All swabs, slides, and saliva reference samples must be air dried prior to packaging. (Penal Code Section 13823.11) This prevents deterioration of evidence and ensures preservation of genetic marker enzymes which can be typed for comparison with potential suspects. b. Complete drying of a saturated swab requires one hour in a stream of cool air. (Do not use heated air.) For best results, use a fan and a drying rack, or a swab drying box with a fan. Chain of custody during the drying process can be maintained by using a drying box with a lock, or by securing the box or swab rack and fan in a locked cabinet. A shorter drying time may be possible as new technology evolves. See Appendix 0 for information on making or purchasing a drying box. See the State of California Medical Protocol Informational Guide for informa\u00ad tion on the preservation of genetic marker enzymes and other crime labora\u00ad tory tests. c. Hospitals experienced with air drying swabs recommend prelabeling the rows on the drying rack for oral, vaginal, and rectal swabs. Label the shaft of the swab with an adhesive label and place on the drying rack immediately after collection to expedite handling. 2. Frozen storage Once dried, swabs and blood and secretion stains on clothing should be stored frozen as soon as possible. This is ordinarily the responsibility of the local law enforcement agency. Follow procedures recommended by the local crime labora\u00ad tory. E. REFERENCE SAMPLES 1. Types of reference samples Reference samples include saliva, blood, pubic and head hair, and facial and body hair in males. They are used to determine whether or not specimens collected are foreign to the patient, and to compare to potential suspects. 2. Time of collection Reference samples can be collected at the time of the examination or at a later date. The time of collection depends upon the pOlicies of the local crime labora\u00ad tory. 18 3. Patient consent for collection Patients have the right to refuse collection of reference samples. They should be informed that refusal to allow the collection of reference sample(s) at the time of the examination or later will prohibit the crime laboratory from comparing the evidence in question. 4. Liquid whole blood samples Tubes containing reference liquid whole blood samples should be refrigerated, not frozen. F. EVIDENCE CONTAINERS 1. Packaging procedures a. Package dried swabs in envelopes or tubes, slides in envelopes or slide mailers, and gauze or pledgets in envelopes. b. Package foreign materials (fibers, hair, twigs, grass, dirt, splinters, glass, blood, heavily crusted semen) and fingernail scrapings in paper bindles. See Appendix E on how to make a bindle. c. Package pubic hair combings and pubic, head, and body hair reference sam\u00ad ples in envelopes. d. Package bindles, tubes, slide mailers, and small envelopes in chain of custo\u00ad dy envelopes. 2. Preassembled kits Preassembled kits that contain the necessary items for evidential examinations can be purchased from pharmaceutical companies, obtained from the local crime laboratory, or assembled from items which are part of regular hospital supplies. See Appendix F for a list of contents in a sample sexual assault evidence kit. G. COLLECTION OF CLOTHING A change of clothing should be provided for patients or obtained by friends or rela\u00ad tives. Coordination between law enforcement agencies, victim service agencies, and the hospital to provide a change of clothing is recommended. If a change of clothing cannot be provided at the hospital, the law enforcement officer should collect the patient's clothing for evidence after the patient is taken home. 1. Prior to disrobing a. Have patients remain clothed until it is time to conduct the examination. b. Place two sheets' of clean paper on the floor on top of one another. The purpose of the bottom sheet is to protect clothing and the top sheet, which will be submitted to the crime laboratory, from debris or dirt on the floor. The disposable paper used on examination tables is acceptable for these pur\u00ad poses. c. Have patients remove their shoes prior to stepping on the paper for disrobing to avoid contamination of loose trace evidence with nonevidential debris from the shoe soles. The shoes may be collected and packaged separately if indicated by the circumstances of the case. d. Observe the condition of patients' clothing before they disrobe. Note rips, tears, and the presence of foreign materials on OCJP 923 (Part E, Item #3) or OCJP 925 (Part F, Item #2). Clothing may be scanned with a Wood's Lamp to detect areas of fluorescence. (1) Do not remove foreign materials firmly attached to clothing. 19 (2) Fine, loose debris falling from clothing should be collected in the top sheet of paper placed on the floor for this purpose. (3) Loose debris that is large, has outstanding characteristics, or appears significant can be packaged separately in a bindle or collected in the top sheet of paper. If foreign materials from the clothing are packaged separately in a bindle, label and seal. (4) Record whether foreign materials were collected on OCJP 923 (Part E, Item #11) or OCJP 925 (Part F, Item #7). 2. Disrobing and collection a. Have patients disrobe on the paper in order to collect any loose foreign material falling from the clothing. b. Collect all outer and under clothing worn during or immediately after the assault because of the possible presence of vaginal drainage, other stains, fibers, and pubic hairs. . c. Fold each garment as it is removed to prevent stains or foreign materials from being lost or transferred from one garment to another. Try to avoid folding the clothing across any stains. d. Package each garment in an individual paper bag. Never package clothing in plastic, always package in a paper bag. Plastic bags retain moisture which may result in mold and deterioration. e. Wet or damp clothing must be given to the law enforcement officer with directions to arrange for drying according to procedures established by the local crime laboratory. f. Carefully fold the top sheet of paper to resemble a large bindle to ensure that all foreign materials will be contained inside. Label and seal. g. Place this large-sized bindle and all the individually bagged garments into large paper bags. Label and seal. h. Record whether clothing was collected on OCJP 923 (Part E, Item #11) or OCJP 925 (Part F, Item #7). H. COLLECTION OF FINGERNAIL SCRAPINGS Fingernail scrapings may contain a variety of evidential materials including blood or tissue, if the victim scratcl1ed the perpetrator, or other foreign materials from the crime scene environment. 1. If history indicates, or foreign material related to the assault is observed, collect fingernail scrapings a. Use a clean fingernail file or manicure stick to collect scrapings from under the fingernails. b. Collect scrapings from each hand into a separate bindle. Label and seal. 2. Record findings Record whether scrapings were collected on OCJP 923 (Part E, Item #11) or OCJP 925 (Part F, Item #7). I. WOOD'S (LONG WAVE ULTRAVIOLET) LAMP SCAN A visual examination can be aided with the use of long wave ultraviolet light, common\u00ad ly known as a Wood's Lamp. This can be used to scan the body or clothing for evidence of dried or moist secretions, stains, fluorescent fibers not readily visible in white light, or subtle injury. Ultraviolet light searches should be done in a darkened room. 20 ---------- r 1. Semen Dried semen stains have a characteristic shiny, mucoid appearance and tend to flake off the skin. Under an ultraviolet light, semen usually exhibits a blue-white or orange fluorescence. Fluorescent areas usually appear as smears, streaks, or splash marks. Since freshly dried semen may not fluoresce, swab each suspicious area with a separate swab whether it fluoresces or not. Fluorescent areas ob\u00ad served under ultraviolet light are not necessarily specific to seminal fluid. Inde\u00ad pendent confirmation of these findings is necessary. Collect specimens and submit to the crime laboratory for analysis. See Collection of Dried and Moist Secretions, Stains, or Foreign Materials from the Body (page 21) 2. Subtle injury Rope marks, recent contusions, and other subtle injuries may be more visible with the aid of a Wood's Lamp. A visual examination is necessary to differentiate between past or recent trauma. 3. Wr.:,()II'l's Lamp findings All Wood's Lamp findings must be separately identified on the OCJP 923 or OCJP 925 diagrams and labeled \"W.L.\" J. COLLECTION OF DRIED AND MOIST SECRETIONS, STAINS, OR FOREIGN MATERIALS FROM THE BODY Collect dried and moist secretions identified through the general physical examination and the Wood's Lamp scan. Any suspicious stains should be collected, packaged separately, and labeled as to location. 1. Heavily-crusted semen or blood stains a. Gently scrape the site into a paper bindle with the edge of a clean glass slide or the back of a clean scalpel blade. b. If material is found on the pubic hair, cut out the matted hairs bearing the specimen and package in a bindle. Label and seal. c. Use the OCJP 923 or OCJP 925 diagrams to record the location of semen or blood stains on the body and note injuries that may account for blood stains. 2. Thinner semen, blood or saliva stains a. Stains that cannot readily be scraped off may be collected by using a swab or small piece of gauze moistened with distilled water. b. Label and air dry the swab before packaging. c. A swabbing should be made of a like area of the victim's body that is un\u00ad stained for laboratory control purposes. Record whether control swabs were taken on OCJP 923 (Part E, Item #11) or OCJP 925 (Part F, Item #7). d. Place the swab in an envelope or tube. Label and seal. e. Use the OCJP 923 or OCJP 925 diagrams to record the location of semen or blood stains on the body and note injuries which may account for blood stains. 3. Moist secre~:ons a. Collect moist secretions with a dry swab to avoid dilution. b. Label and air dry the swab before packaging. c. Place the swab in an envelope or tube. Label and seal. d. Use the OCJP 923 or OCJP 925 diagrams to record the location of secretions on the body. 21 4. Collection of foreign materials from body a. Foreign materials such as fibers, hair/ grass, and dirt should be collected and packaged in a separate paper bindle for each location of the body. Use tweezers or gently scrape the substance into a bindle with a clean slide or the back of a scalpel blade. b. Label with a description of the material arid the location from which it was collected and seal. c. Use the OCJP 923 or OCJP 925 diagrams to record the location of foreign materials found on the body. 5. Record findings Record whether specimens or foreign materials were collected on OCJP 923 (Part E, Item #11) \u00b7or OCJP 925 (Part F, Item #7). K. PROCEDURES FOR BI'TE MARKS AND BRUISES 1. Record location of bite marks and bruises Describe the location on the body where bite marks and bruises wE;lre found on the OCJP 923 or OCJP 925 diagrams. 2. Photograph bite marks and bruises a. Properly taken, photographs of bite marks and bruises assist in the identifica\u00ad tion of the person or object inflicting the injury. Individuals can be identified by the shape of bite marks. A forensic dentist should be consulted in these cases especially if a bite mark has broken or perforated the skin and casts of the mark may be indicated. b. Bruises and bite marks may not be obvious immediately follolNing an assa.,ult. A recommendation should be made to the law enforcement agency to ar\u00ad range for follow-up inspection and additional photographs after the bruising has developed more fully. Photographs should be taken for six days at 24 hour intervals because bruises and bite marks become more apparent with time. See Photographic Evidence (page 22) 3. Collect particulate debris and saliva from bite marks a., Swab each bite mark and the immediate surrounding area with a separate swab moistened in distilled water to collect salivary residue from the perpetra\u00ad tor. A swabbing should be made of a like area of the victim's body which is saliva-free for laboratory control purposes. b. Label and air dry the swabs before packaging. c. Place the swabs in separate envelopes or tubes. Label and seal. d. Record whether swabs were collected on OCJP 923 (Part E, Item #11) or OCJP 925 (Part F, Item #7). L. PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE 1. Policies and considerations a. Photographs can be a valuable supplement and may be necessary in situa\u00ad tions which cannot be adequately documented in diagrams, e.g., bite marks or massive injuries. b. Photographs may be taken in accordance with hospital procedures or be arranged with the local law enforcement agency. c. Sensitivity to patient concerns about undress should be considered as to whether hospital personnel or a male or female law enforcement officer takes the photographs. 22 r i d. Patients should be appropriately draped. 2. Photographic procedures a. Any camera may be used as long as it can be focused for nondistorted, close-up shots and provides an accurate color rendition. Adequate lighting is essential whether the source is natural, flood, or flash. b. Close-up photographs of bite marks and other wounds should be taken with the film plane as parallel to the subject area as possible, i.e., the camera should be held perpendicular to the body surface being photographed. This is essential to avoid photographic distortion of bite marks or bruises on curved surfaces such as the breast, shoulder, or face. Tilting of the camera should be minimizled to avoid distortion of the picture. c. Arrange thE! photograph to include an accurate ruler or scale in close proxim\u00ad ity to the lesion for size reference, and a label with the patient's name for identification purposes. Avoid obscuring the lesion with the ruler or label. At least one or two photographs should be be taken without the scale to orient the lesion Ctnd to demonstrate the scale has not obscured important evi\u00ad dence. The scale should be retained for later reference to enable the photo\u00ad graphic laboratory to produce an accurate life-sized (1:1) photograph. This photograph can then be compared to dental models (casts) of suspects in the case of bite marks, or to the weapon or other object which may have inflicted the injury. d. Record the name of the photographer on OCJ P 923 (Part E, Item # 11) or OCJP 925 (Part F, Item #7). e. ProceSSing may be done commercially. See the State of California Medical Protocol Informational Guide for additional information on photographiC techniques for bite marks. M. PREPARATION AND EXAMINATION OF WET MOUNT SLIDE FOR PRESENCE OF SPERM 1. Emergency room examination Wet mount slides are used to determine the presence or absence of motile or nonmotile sperm in the vagina of the sexual assault victim. The presence of motile sperm in the vaginal pool indicates recent penetration and ejaculation. The ab\u00ad sence of motile sperm, however, does not negate the possibility of recent pene\u00ad tration and ejaculation as sperm tend to become immobile rapidly in the vaginal environment. Since sperm motility can only be observed on an unstained wet mount slide, the motility examination must be performed under a microscope as a part of the emergency room examination. The slide also has evidential value and must be retained and submitted along with other evidence collected from the patient Even when sperm are not observed initially in the unstained slide for the motility examination, they may be detected on subsequent examination of the dried, stained smear. See the State of California Medical Protocol Informational Guide for information on interpreting the results of the semen evidence examination. 2. Wet mount slide procedures Normal saline can be used to prepare wet mount slides. The chances of observing motile sperm will be improved, however, if a buffered nutrient medium is used instead. A glucose fortified solution of balanced salts, such as Hank's, Earl's, Ringer's, is recom\u00ad mended for this purpose. Prepared solutions of media designed to enhance sperm survival during microscopic examinations are commercially available. 23 a. Label a slide with the patient's name. Place a drop of buffered nutrient medium or normal saline on the slide to preserve the motility of the sperm. b. Select one of the swabs collected from the vaginal pool and roll the swab back and forth in the drop to transfer cellular debris to the medium. c. Place a cover slip on the slide and examine immediately (within 5-10 min\u00ad utes) using a biological microscope at a magnification of at least 400 power to determine whether or not sperm are present. A phase contrast microscope, if available, is helpful for this purpose. d. Label and air dry the swabs and slides. Code the swabs and slides to enable the crime laboratory to determine which slide was made from which swab, e.g., vaginal wet mount swab # 1, vaginal wet mount slide # 1. e. Package the slide in an envelope or slide mailer and the swab in a tube or envelope. Label and seal. f. Record the presence or absence of motile or nonmotile sperm on OCJP 923 (Part E, Item #11) or OCJP 925 (Part F, Item #7). N. MOUTH EXAMINATION AND EVIDENCE COLLECTION PROCEDURES 1. Examine for injury and seminal fluid Examine the oral cavity for injury and the area around the mouth for evidence of seminal fluid. Particular attention should be given to the frenulum beneath the tongue, the base of the lower lip, and the pharynx for exudates, lacerations, and contusions. 2. Evidence collection procedures a. Swab the area around the mouth if indicated. Collect dried secretions with a swab moistened with distilled water. Collect moist secretions with a dry swab to avoid dilution of the specimen. b. Collect two swabs from the oral cavity up to six hours postassault for seminal fluid if indicated by history. Prepare two dry mount slides, one from each swab. Recommended areas to swab in the mouth inclUde the gum to the tonsillar fossae, the upper first and second molars, behind the incisors, and the fold of the cheek. c. Label and air dry the swabs and slides. Code the corresponding swabs and slides to enable the crime laboratory to determine which slide was made from which swab, e.g., oral swab # 1, oral ~Hde # 1. d. Package the slides in envelopes or si;de mailers and swabs in tubes or envelopes. Label and seal. e. Collect a saliva reference sample at the time of the examination if required by the local crime laboratory. (1) With clean forceps or tweezers, place a clean gauze, filter paper, or cotton pledget under the tongue and allow it to remain there until satu\u00ad rated. Swabs can also be used for this purpose. Do not handle the sample with the. fingers; use tweezers or forceps. (2) Air dry the sample and package it in an envelope. Label and seal. f. Record findings on the OCJP 923 or OCJP 925 diagrams and specimens collected on OCJP 923 (Part E, Item #11) or OCJP 925 (Part E, Item #7). 3. Conduct base line test (s) for sexually transmitted disease a. For adults: If indicated by history. collect a specimen for gonorrhea culture from the oropharynx as a base line and offer prophylaxis. Take other STD cultures as indicated. 24 b. For children: Collect a specimen for gonorrhea culture from the oropharynx as a base line and provide prophylaxis. Take other STD cultures as indicated. See Treatment of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (page 93) O. COLLECTION OF SPECIMENS FROM PUBIC HAIR 1. Collection of specimens a. Place a sheet of paper beneath the patient's buttocks. b. Collect secretions dried on the pubic hair by cutting the matted hair. Package the cut hair in a bindle. Label and seal. c. ' Comb the pubic hair. (1) Brush or comb pubic hair forward with a new, unused comb or brush to remove any loose hairs or foreign materials which may have transferred to the patient during the assault. (2) Place the loose hairs, foreign materials, pubic hair, and comb in the paper from under the patient's buttocks and fold the paper with the contents inside. (3) Place the folded paper and its contents in a large envelope or bag. Label and seal. 2. Collection of pubic hair reference samples Reference samples can be collected at the time of the examination or at a later date according to the policies of the local crime laboratory. a. Cut the hairs close to the skin or pluck at least 15 to 20 hairs representative of variations in length and color from different areas of the pubic region. b. The decision to cut or pluck hairs should be made in conjunction with the local crime laboratory. Plucking hairs can be quite painful. Plucked hairs are more reliable, however, as reference samples than cut hairs as they permit evalua\u00ad tion of the hair length and variation of natural pigmentation or hair dyes from the root to the tip of the hair. c. Package the hairs in a bindle. Label and seal. 3. Record findings Record specimens collected on OCJP 923 (Part E, Item # 11) or OC.JP 925 (Part F, Item #7) P. ANUS/RECTUM EXAMINATION AND COLLECTION PROCEDURES 1. Examine for injury and foreign materials Examine the buttocks, perianal skin, and anal folds for injuries and the presence of seminal fluid, dried or moist secretions, bleeding, fecal matter, evidence of lubricant, and any other foreign materials. Injuries may include abrasions, lacera\u00ad tions, fissures (both fresh and healed), ecchymoses, edema, contusions, or petechiae. 2. Evidence collection procedures a. Collect dried and moist secretions and foreign materials. b. Scan the area with a Wood's Lamp. Swab each suspicious substance or fluorescent area. c. Collect two rectal swabs if indicated by patient history and/or physical find\u00ad ings. 25 (1) Rectal swabs must be collected by a method that prevents the transfer of semen that may be present on the perianal area into the rectum. To prevent contact between the swab and the anus during the introduction of the swab into the rectum: (a) Clean the area around the anus after the examination and collec\u00ad tion of evidence; and small, nonlubricated speculum mois\u00ad tened with warm water, or by instructing the patient to use the lateral recumbent or prone knee-to-chest position. (2) When present, semen tends to collect at the anal opening of the mucocutaneous juncture of the sphincter mucosa. Collection of seminal. fluid from the rectum is more effective if the swab is introduced slowly and rotated 360\u00b0, than if the swab is inserted and withdrawn in rapid succession. (3) Prepare two dry mount slides, one from each swab. (4) Label and air dry swabs and slides. Code the corresponding swabs and slides to enable the crime labora\u00ad tory to determine which slide was made from which swab, e.g., rectal swab # 1, rectal slide # 1. d. Package the slides in envelopes or slide mailers and swabs in tubes or envelopes. Label and seal. 3. Evaluate the need for an anoscopic or proctoscopic examination if rectal injuries are suspected A small. anoscope, speculum, or 10 cc. test tube may be used when only a limited examination is required. Ecchymosis, petechiae, focal edema, internal fissures, lacerations, or excoriations may be seen with anoscopy. Proctoscopy, with an appropriate-sized instrument, is indicated when significant rectal trauma is sus\u00ad pected. 4. Conduct base line test (s) for sexually transmitted disease a. For adults: If indicated by history, collect a specimen for gonorrhea culture from the rectum as a base line and offer prophylaxis. Take other STD cultures as indicated. b. For children: Collect a specimen for gonorrhea culture from the rectum as a base line and provide prophylaxis. Take other STD cultures as indicated. See Treatment of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (page 93) 5. Record f~ndings Record findings on the OCJF 923 or OCJP 925 diagrams and specimens collected on OCJP 923 (Part E, Item # 11) or OCJP 925 (Part E, Item #7). Label Wood's Lamp findings \"W. L.\" Q. MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATIONS Microscopic or magnified examinations can be performed with a magnifying lens or colposcope to confirm signs of minor injury to the genital area. Minor abrasions, fissures, hymenal transections, synechiae, petechiae, and focal edema may be seen. Colposcopes have a magnifying range of 5-30 power and many have photographic capability.

Force, threats of force, weapons, threats of harm to a third person such as a child, psychological duress, and intimidation are methods employed by perpetrators. In situa\u00ad tions involving threats or psychological coercion, physical injuries may not be sustained. Perpetrators may be strangers, acquaintances, or someone related to the victim. Victims of rape can sustain psychological trauma regardless of: 8 The relationship between offender and victim; The method of attack; The presence or absence of physical injuries; or Whether the assault is attempted or completed. The stages of the crisis reaction experienced by rape victims have been identified and described as the rape trauma syndrome (Burgess and Holmstrom, 1974) or post-traumatic stress disorder (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM \"I), Anxiety Disorders, 309.30 and 309.31). Rape trauma syndrome has two phases: the immediate or acute phase and the long-term reorganization and assimilation phase. A. IMMEDIATE CRISIS REACTIONS. Emotional and behavioral stress reactions indicative of the acute phase include: 8 Numbness Shock and disbelief, dazed or bewildered presentation Diminished alertness, cognitive confusion Flat affect, psychological distancing, and preoccupation Dulled sensory, affective, and memory functions Feelings of terror 8 Fearfulness, anxiety, or hysteria Outward calm and collectedness B. SUBSEQUENT EMOTIONAL REACTIONS. Emotional and behavioral stress reactions, which may last for several months or even years and cause significant disruption in the victim's life, include: Continuing fear and anxiety Sense of helplessness Persistent fear or depression Mood swings Denial Sleep disturbances (e.g., vivid dreams, recurrent nightmares, insomnia, and wakefulness) Somatic symptoms 8 Appetite disturbances Poor concentration Preoccupation with the event including flashbacks 43 Self-blame, guilt, and shame Sexual dysfunction Depressive symptoms Phobic reactions Withdrawal from peers and friends C. SUPPORTIVE APPROACH. Crisis intervention theory, which describes clusters of emotions proceeding through the phases of active crisis, reintegration or crisis resolution, and normalization, pro\u00ad vides a theoretical framework for understanding and responding to the patient. Psy\u00ad cho!ogical reactions may be experienced with varying degrees of intensity as the person progresses through each stage of emotional adjustment. Cultural differences, life-stage issues, mental or physical disabilities, and previous victimization may intensify the psychological trauma experienced by the patient. Deve\u00ad lopmentally disabled, hearing impaired, and other handicapped individuals are espe\u00ad cially at risk for sexual victimization and require particularly sensitive treatment. Examining practitioners must demonstrate nonjudgmental, sympathetic approaches to assist with the reduction of the acute psychological trauma and its aftereffects. See the State of California Medical Protocol Informational Guide for additional information on psychological and sociocultural factors. 44 r Adult Female Evidential Examination Sexual assault patients should be assigned priority in triage along with other serious emergencies. If the incident(s) occurred within the past 72 hours, the examination must be conducted without delay to minimize loss or deterioration of evidence. The hospital should develop a system for rapidly escorting patients to a private area. A trained support person (patient coordinator) should be assigned. The lettered and numbered sections below correspond to the lettered and numbered sections of OCJP 923. A. OBTAIN IDENTIFYING INFORMATION ABOUT THE PATIENT AND NOTIFY AUTHORITIES OF CRIME-RELATED INJURIES Physical examiners are not required to complete this portion of the interview. Trained personnel such as a nurse, social worker, or patient coordinator may interview and record patient history on OCJP 923. B. OBTAIN PATIENT CONSENT 1. Patients requesting examination and treatment only Inform the patient of the state law requiring hospitals to report treatment request\u00ad ed for crime-related injuries and obtain consent for treatment. 2. Patients requesting examination, treatment, and evidence collection a. Obtain the patient's signed consent for the examination. b. Obtain the patient's signed consent to photograph injuries. c. Inform the patient about the availability of crime victim compensation. C. OBTAIN THE SIGNATURE OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER TO AUTHOR\u00ad IZE PAYMENT FOR THE EVIDENTIAL EXAMINATION AT PUBLIC EXPENSE OR OBTAIN A TELEPHONE AUTHORIZATION PURSUANT TO LOCAL AGREE\u00ad MENTS D. OBTAIN PATIENT HISTORY 1. Record the name of the person providing the history, the relationship to the patient, and the date and time of the assault(s). 2. Record the location and physical surroundings of the assault(s) If the incident occurred within 72 hours of the examination, the body and clothing should be observed for evidence from the scene of the assault, e.g., grass, sand, glass, or fibers. 3. Record the name(s), if known, the number, and race(s) of the perpe\u00ad trator(s) Some genetic marker variants are race-dependent. This information is used to determine which crime laboratory tests are indicated. 4. Record the acts described by the patient a. This information is necessary to guide the medical examination and for inter\u00ad pretation of crime laboratory tests. A careful patient history must be taken as some patients may be reluctant to describe all acts committed, particularly anal penetration. b. By law, any penetration, however slight, of the labia or rectum by the penis or any penetration of a genital or anal opening by a foreign object or body part constitutes the act. The legal definitions of oral copulation and masturbation only require contact. c. If there was more than one perpetrator, identify which person committed which acts. 45 5. Record physical injuries and/or pain described by the patient and the area (s) of the body affected This information should be used to direct the physician to look for injury and evidence not readily visible. Identify injuries occurring prior to and independent of the assault (e.g., fractured arm, lacerations, or bruising) to clarify all findings. 6. Record threats, types of force or other methods used by the perpe\u00ad trator(s), and the area(s) of the body affected a. This information should be used to direct the physician to look for injury and evidence not readily visible. It may also indicate the need for special docu~ mentation, such as photography, or a need for a repeat examination 24 to 72 hours later to observe development of bruises. b. If coercion, intimidation, psychological pressure, and/or abuse of position of trust were employed, record the method(s) used under \"other\". 7. Record postassault hygiene/activity if the incident occurred within 72 hours of the examination This information is relevant because it can affect the laboratory analysis of evi\u00ad dence. If the patient has bathed, showered, or douched, the examiner should still collect samples from the appropriate body orifices to attempt to preserve any trace evidence. 8. Record pertinent medical information All information on OCJP 923 is admissible in court. Only information essential to interpreting laboratory or physical findings should be recorded on the form. a. Obtain information regarding the date of the last menstrual period to deter\u00ad mine whether the patient is menstruating at the time of the examination and to evaluate the possibility of pregnancy and postcoital options. See Possibility of Pregnancy (page 91) b. Obtain information on anal-genital injuries, surgeries, diagnostic procedures, or medical treatment within the past 60 days to avoid confusing lesions with injuries related to the al/eged assault. Check the appropriate box. If yes, record the information in a separate patient medical chart. c. Ascertain whether the patient has had consenting intercourse within the past 72 hours and record the approximate date and time. This information is required by the crime laboratory as it can effect analysis of evidence. d. Record other information such as medications, allergies, and general past medical history in a separate patient medical chart. E. CONDUCT A GENERAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AND RECORD FINDINGS\u00ad COLLECT AND PRESERVE EVIDENCE FOR THE EVIDENTIAL EXAMINATION 1. Record blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration 2. Record height, weight, and eye and hair color 3. Note condition of clothing worn during the incident upon arrival Note any rips or tears or the presence of foreign materials. Foreign materials may include fibers, hair, twigs, grass. soil. splinters. glass. blood. or seminal fluid. See Collection of Clothing (page 19). 4. Collect all clothing worn during and immediately after an assault Record whether clothing was collected on OCJP 923 (Part E, Item #11). See Collection of Clothing (page 19) ./ I 46 5. Collect fingernail scrapings if indicated by the history of the assault or if foreign material related to the assault is observed Record whether scrapings were collected on OCJP 923 (Part E, Item #11). See Collection of Fingernail Scrapings (page 20). 6. Conduct a general physical examination (head to toe) for injuries and other evidence of the reported assault a. Record general physical appearance. b. Collect dried and moist secretions, stains, and foreign materials from the body including the head, hair, and scalp. Collect control swabs if indicated. c. Scan the entire body with a long wave ultraviolet light (Wood's Lamp) and swab each suspicious stain or fluorescent area with a separate swab'. d. Use the OCJP 923 diagrams to record the location, size, and appearance of injuries and evidence of foreign materials. Signs of injury may include ery\u00ad thema, abrasions, bruises, contusions, induration, lacerations, fractures, bleeding, bites, burns, or stains. Label Wood's Lamp findings \"W.L.\" e. Record specimens collected on OCJP 923 (Part E, Item # 11) . See Collection of Dried or Moist Secretions, Stains, or Foreign Materials from the Body (page 21) Wood's Lamp Scan (page 20) Procedures for Bite Marks and Bruises (page 22). 7. Examine the mouth a. Examine the oral cavity for injury and the area around the mouth for evidence of seminal fluid. (1) Swab the area around the mouth if indicated. Collect two swabs from the oral cavity for seminal fluid up to six hours postassault. Prepare two dry mount slides. (2) If indicated by history, collect a specimen for gonorrhea culture from the oropharynx as a base line and offer prophylaxis. Take other STD cul\u00ad tures as indicated. (3) Collect a saliva reference sample at the time of the examination if required by the local crime laboratory. See Mouth Examination and Evidence Collection Procedures (page 24) Treatment of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (page 93) b. Record findings on the OCJP 923 diagrams and specimens collected on Part E, Item #11. 8. Examine the external genitalia Place a sheet of paper beneath the patient's buttocks prior to the examination. a. Examine the external genitalia for signs of injury. (1) The examination should fourchette, and medial aspect of the thighs. (2) Signs of injury may include erythema, abrasions, bruises, contusions, induration, lacerations, bleeding, or bites. b. Examine the external genitalia and pubic hair for dried and moist secretions and foreign materials. 47 -------------------------- ------ -- - - (1) Collect secretions dried on the pubic hair by cutting the matted hair. (2) Comb the pubic hair to collect any loose hair or foreign materials. (3) Scan the area with a Wood's Lamp and swab fluorescent areas. (4) Package specimens collected and label containers. (5) Collect and fold the paper placed beneath the patient's buttocks with the comb inside. Label and seal. See Wood's Lamp Scan (page 20) Collection of Dried and Moist Secretions, Stains, or Foreign Materials from the Body (page 21) Collection of Specimens from Pubic Hair (page 25) c. Record findings on the OCJP 923 diagrams as they relate to their anatomic position and describe with reference to the face of a clock, e.g., midline injuries at the entrance to the vagina over the posterior fourchette would be located at the 6 o'clock position. Label Wood's Lamp findings \"W.L.\" and record specimens collected on Part E, Item #11. 9. Examine the vagina and cervix a. Use a non lubricated, warm speculum moistened with water. Consideration of speculum size is necessary for the elderly, adolescents, and women who do not ordinarily have sexual relations with male partners. To prevent loss of evidence from the genital area through wiping or washing, the patient should not void prior to the examination, if possible. If the patient must urinate, provide a specipan and send the urine to the hospital laboratory to be examined for motile or nonmotile sperm. The tissue used for wiping should be dried, labeled, and submitted with the other evidence. b. Examine the vagina and cervix for injuries and foreign materials. Signs of injury may include lacerations, abrasions, ecchymosiS, or hemato~ mas. The distensibility of the introitus and the condition and type of hymen should be noted. A common finding after recent coitus is erythema of the posterior fourchette and superficial abrasion of the area. c. Collect a minimum of three swabs from the vaginal pool, depending upon the amount of secretions present. (1) Collect specimens from the vaginal pool, not the cervix. Nonmotile sperm can be detected in samples from the vaginal pool up to three days postcoitus and up to two weeks in the cervix. Cervical specimens should be collected in addition to samples from the vaginal pool only if the assault occurred more than 24 hours prior to the exami\u00ad nation and no possibility exists of contaminating the specimen with semen from previous coitus. If a speCimen is collected from the cervix, it must be so labeled. See the State of California Medical Protocol Informational Guide for information about the survival of sperm in the vagina and cervix. (2) Hold the swabs together as a unit and insert them into the vaginal pool at the same time. Rotate the swabs in the vaginal vault as a unit to ensure uniform distribution of the sample on all three swabs. (3) Use one swab to prepare a wet mount slide using normal saline or a buffered nutrient medium and examine immediately for motile or non\u00ad motile sperm. 48 I . See Preparation and Examination of Wet Mount Slide for Presence of Sperm (page 23) (4) Prepare two dry mount slides from the other two swabs. (5) Label and air dry the swabs and slides. Code the swabs and slides to enable the crime laboratory to determine which slide was made from which swab, e.g., vaginal swab #1, vaginal slide #1. Indicate which slide was used for the wet mount examination. (6) Package the slides in envelopes or slide mailers and swabs in tubes or envelopes. Label and seal. d. Aspirate/washings or urine specimens may be collected for the detection of spermatozoa at the discretion of the physician or local jurisdiction after collec\u00ad tion of the vaginal swabs. e. Microscopic or magnified examinations can be performed with a magnifying lens or colposcope to confirm signs of minor injury to the genital area. Many colposcopes have photographic capability. See Microscopic Examinations (page 26) f. At the physician's discretion, a bimanual examination and a Pap test may be done and treatment offered for gynecological conditions unrelated to the assault. If a Pap test is performed, the pathologist should be asked to note the presence of spermatozoa as well as other conditions. g. If indicated, collect a specimen for gonorrhea culture from the endocervix as a base line and offer prophylaxis. Take other STD cultures as indicated. See Treatment of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (page 93) h. Record findings on the OCJP 923 diagrams and specimens collected on Part E, Item #11. 10. Examine the anus and rectum a. Examine the buttocks, perianal skin, and anal folds for signs of injury and foreign materials. Note presence of seminal fluid, dried or moist secretions, bleeding, fecal matter, lubricants, and any other foreign materials. b. Collect dried and moist secretions and foreign materials. c. Scan the area with a Wood's Lamp. Swab each suspicious substance or fluorescent area. d. If indicated by patient history and/or physical findings: (1) Collect a minimum of two rectal swabs and prepare two dry mount slides. Avoid contaminating rectal swabs by cleaning the perianal area and dilating the anus using an anal speculum. (2) Evaluate the need for an anoscopic or proctoscopic examination if rectal injuries are suspected. e. If indicated by history, collect a specimen for gonorrhea cultu~e from the rectum as a base line and offer prophylaxis. Take other STD cultures as indicated. See Anus/Rectum Examination and Collection Procedures (page 25) Treatment of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (page 93) f. Record findings on the OCJP 923 diagrams and specimens collected on Part E, Item #11. Label Wood's Lamp findings \"W.L.\". 11.

It may consist of many acts over a long period of time (chronic molestation) or a single incident. Victims range in age from less than one year through adolescence. A. SEXUALLY ABUSIVE CONDUCT 1. Genital exposure The adult exposes his or her genitals to the child and may ask the child to touch the genitals. 2. Kissing The adult kisses the child in a lingering and intimate manner appropriately re\u00ad served for adults. 3. Fondling The adult fondles the child's breasts, abdomen, genital area, inner thighs, or buttocks. The child may similarly be requested to fondle the adult. 4. Masturbation The adult masturbates while the child observes, the adult observes the child masturbating, the adult and child observe each other while masturbating them\u00ad selves, or the adult and child masturbate each other (mutual masturbation). 5. Oral genital contact Fellatio and cunnilingus. 6. Vaginal penetration Penetration of the vagina by finger, penis, or foreign object. 7. Anal penetration Penetration of the anus by finger, penis, or foreign object. 8. Intracrural or dry intercourse The adult rubs his penis against the child's anal-genital area, inner thighs, or buttocks. 9. Child pornography The posing or modeling of minors involved in sexual conduct for the purpose of preparing a film, photograph, negative, slide, or a live performance. 10. Child prostitution Commercial sexual exploitation of children. B. PERPETRATORS Perpetrators may be immediate or extended family members, child care personnel, family friends, neighbors, acquaintances, or strangers. They may be male, female, adults, adolescents, or older children. Young juveniles have also been identified as offenders. Approximately 75 to ~O percent of the perpetrators are known to the child. 55 C. TYPES OF CHILD SEXUAL VICTIMIZATION 1. Intrafamily child sexual abuse The most commonly reported type of sexual abuse involves family members, stepparents, or parent surrogates. Fathers, mothers, grandparents, siblings, aunts, uncles, and cousins have been identified as perpetrators. The child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome describes patterns of behavior exhibited by abused children (Summit, 1979): a. Keeping the molestation a secret; b. Feelings of helplessness, reinforced by a sense of isolation, secrecy, and guilt; c. Entrapment and accommodation; d. Delayed, conflicted, or unconvincing disclosure; and/or e. Retraction of the complaint. 2. Child molestation by nonfamily members Child care facilities, family day care, school, and after-school activity groups are other settings in which children may be vulnerable to abuse. Adults may use these positions of special trust and/or authority to abuse and exploit children. 3. Forcible child sexual assault Rape is most commonly associated with adolescent victims, although forcible sexual assaults are also reported involving young children. In the majority of these cases, the offender is not known to the victim. The sexual acts are usually forced oral, vaginal, or anal penetration. Injuries may result either from the act or the force used to secure the submission of the victim. Typically, enticement (\"come and see the ducks\") or abduction are used to separate and isolate the child from family and friends. 4. Child sexual exploitation This term is used to describe pornography, prostitution, sex-rings, or circum\u00ad stances involving organized abuse of multiple victims by multiple offenders. The perpetrators may include an association of both family and nonfamily members. Financiai gain is the principal motivation for pornography, prostitution, and sex rings. Abuse of multiple victims by multiple offenders, sometimes involving ritualis\u00ad tic practices, is a recent phenomena under study. D. METHODS EMPLOYED BY PERPETRATORS 1. Coercion The offender typically uses implicit or direct coercion to involve the child in sexual activity and to secure compliance. Coercion may take the form of psychological pressure, exertion of adult authority, misrepresentation of moral standards, gifts or rewards, or force and threats. Children may cooperate because of unmet needs for love, affection, and attention, a sense of loyalty to the adult, or confusion about what to do. 2. Progression of contact Sexual contact typically begins with fondling and may gradually proceed to mas\u00ad turbation, digital penetration, oral-genital contact, vaginal, or anal penetration. Oral or anal penetration may occur early in the progression because of the relative ease of penetration. Ejaculation by a male perpetrator against the child's body or on the outer clothing may occur at any time in the progression. 56 r E. PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT The most common psychological reactions to sexual abuse are listed below. The first four may occur regardless of the identity and relationship of the perpetrator to the victim. The remaining reactions are more characteristic of children molested over time by a family member. Fear/anxiety Guilt/shame Depression Repressed anger/hostility Low self-esteem and poor social skills Inability to trust, if victimized by a known or trusted person Blurred role boundaries and role confusion Pseudomaturity coupled with failure to accomplish developmental tasks Developmental delay. Cultural issues and previous victimization may intensify the psychological reaction experienced by the patient. Developmentally disabled, hearing-impaired, and other handicapped individuals are especially at risk for sexual victimization and require particularly sensitive treatment. F. CRISIS PERIODS The medical examination may arouse feelings of loss of control or cause the patient to re-experience a sense of abuse and accompanying shame. The following events can also create or intensify a crisis reaction in the child victim: Disclosure of recent or past incidents; Removal from the home; Court appearances; Confronting the perpetrator; and/or Parental rejection. G. INDICATORS OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE Sexual abuse of a child may surface through a broad range of physical, behavioral, and social symptoms. Some of these indicators, taken separately, may not be sympto\u00ad matic of sexual .abuse. They are listed below as a guide, and should be examined in the context of other behavior (s) or situational factors. 1. Disclosure The single most important indicator is disclosure to a friend, classmate, teacher, friend's mother, or other trusted adult. The disclosure may be direct or indirect, e.g., \"I know someone,\" \"What would you do if?,\" '\" heard something about somebody.\" Delay in disclosure by children experiencing chronic or acute sexual abuse is common. Children rarely fabricate these accounts; they should be taken seriously. 2. Physical symptoms a. Sexually transmitted diseases b. Genital discharge or infection c. Physical trauma or irritations to the anal-genital area (pain, itching, swelling, bruising, bleeding, lacerations, or abrasions, especially if unexplained or in\u00ad consistent) d. Pain on urination/defecation e. Difficulty in walking or sitting due to genital or anal pain f. Stomachaches, headaches, or other psychosomatic symptoms 57 ---------------- --------- 3. Sexual behaviors a. Detailed and age~inappropriate understanding of sexual behavior (especially by younger children) b. Inappropriate, unusual, or aggressive sexual behavior with peers or toys c. Compulsive masturbation d. Excessive curiosity about sexual matiers or genitalia (self and others) e. Unusually seductive behavior with classmates, teachers, and oth~f adults f.

Fire setting 58 -------------- --- ----- H. INTERVIEWING CHILDREN 1. Avoid multiple, lengthy interviews a. Establish agreements with local law enforcement personnel, prosecutors, and child protective service workers to coordinate the number of interviews needed. b. If the child is reluctant to volunteer information, consult with child protective services and law enforcement personnel to develop an interview plan. 2. Interview setting a. Interview children in a setting oriented to their needs to enable them to feel comfortable and to experience some degree of control returned to them. b. Provide privacy, with no or minimal interruptions. c. Interview children alone, if possible, as they are often reluctant to talk about sexual matters in the presence of parents, especially if a parent is the of\u00ad fender. d. Avoid having the child present during the adult's description of what occurred. e. Avoid confrontations between the child and al/eged perpetrator. 3. Qualifications of the interviewer Personnel should be trained and experienced in interviewing children. They should be knowledgeable about the differences between supportive, sensitive questioning and asking inappropriate leading or suggestive questions. Consulta\u00ad tion on this issue with local law enforcement agencies or the county prosecutor's office is recommended. 4. Attitude of the interviewer a. Convey a relaxed, unhurried attitude and express concern about the child's well-being. Children easily recognize adults who are anxious, uncomfortable, hurried, or ill at ease and are affected accordingly. b. Avoid being judgmental about information supplied by the child or prOjecting your own feelings or perceptions about the situation onto the child. Do not presuppose guilt or anger as neither may be present. Do not presuppose the child found the sexual contact unpleasant. 5. Conducting the interview a. Take time to establish rapport. Begin with a discussion of common, nonsexual topics to enable the child to become comfortable with the situation and to determine the child's general level of functioning. b. Use language appropriate to the developmental level and background of the child. c. Determine the child's understanding of, and terminology for, body parts and functions. Be prepared to use the child's own terminology. d. Avoid focusing on the topic of the assault prior to establishing a relationship. e. Use toys, stuffed animals, anatomically correct dolls, pictures, or drawing diagrams to provide a nonverbal vehicle for children to describe what hap\u00ad pened to them. f. ASK WHO, WHAT, and WHERE questions with young children. WHAT HAP- PENED TO YOU and WHAT DID HE DO are easiest for children to answer. g. Avoid WHY questions or questions that require abstract concepts. h. Avoid inappropriate prompting, leading, or suggestive questions. i. Do not dwell too heavily on the identity of the alleged perpetrator. 59 j. Ask WHEN questions in terms children can understand. Young children often have a poorly developed concept of time and may be inconsistent or unrealis\u00ad tic answering questions. Time is related to events such as birthdays and holidays or the name of their teacher at the time. 6. Documentation of interview a. Record direct quotes of the child's statements. Do not paraphrase. minimize, or characterize a child's response. b. Consider the use of videotaped or audiotaped interviews. 7. Reassurance of the child Children need to be told they are not to blame for what happened to them. Be prepared to reassure them during or at the conclusion of the interview and exami\u00ad nation about: a. The presence or absence of physical injury; b. Fear of consequences or punishment because of disclosure or the child's role in the incident; and c. Concerns about teasing at school, further assault, or potential family separa- tion. . 8. Reassurance of the parents Be prepared to reassure the parent during or at the conclusion of the interview and examination about the: a. Presence or absence of physical injury; and b. Possible psychological consequences of the assault for the child. 9. Follow-up psychological care Arrangements and/or referrals should be made for crisis intervention or short\u00ad term or long-term therapy for some children. See the State of California Medical Protocol Informational Guide for further dis\u00ad cussion of child sexual abuse and psychological treatment needs. 60 ~-~ ~--~ ~--~~ -~-- Pediatric Evidential Examination Sexual abuse patients should be assigned priority in triage along with other serious emergencies. If the incident(s) occurred within the past 72 hours, the examination must be conducted without delay to minimize loss or deterioration of evidence. The hospital should develop a system for rapidly escorting patients to a private room. A trained support person (patient coordinator) should be assigned. The appropriate setting for the examina\u00ad tion depends upon the severity of the injuries and the length of time since the abuse occurred: If less than 72 hours postassault and severe injuries are reported, examine the patient immediately in the emergency room. If less than 72 hours postassault and injury is not severe, examine the patient immediately in an appropriate clinic or office. [f more th?n 72 hours postassault, examine the patient as soon as convenient at an appropriate clinic or office. In some areas of the state, child sexual abuse diagnostic and treatment centers exist to perform interviews and examinations of suspected child abuse victims. If pOSSible, these centers should be used to minimize trauma to the child. The multidisciplinary team ap\u00ad proach involving child protective services, law enforcement personnel, prosecutors, and medical personnel is also recommended and has proven successful in many jurisdictions. These teams coordinate interviews, social and psycho[ogical services, and investigations. The lettered and numbered sections below correspond to the lettered and numbered sections on OCJP 925. A. EXAMINATIONS REQUESTED BY PATIENT, PARENT, OR GUARDIAN-QBTAIN AUTHORIZATION FOR THE EXAMINATION-INFORM PERSON REQUESTING EXAMINATION OF CHILD ABUSE REPORTING LAW REQUIREMENTS 1. Parental consent a. Parents or guardians may initiate and authorize requests for examination, treatment, and evidence collection. Only child protective agencies can au\u00ad thorize evidential examinations at public expense. b. Parental consent is not required, however, to examine, treat, or collect evi\u00ad dence (including photographs and ske[etal x-rays) for suspected child abuse. In the absence of parental consent or in case of parental refusal, children must be taken into protective custody by a child protective agency. 2. Minor patients' consent Minors, 12 years of age or older, may consent to the examination, treatment, and collection of evidence for a sexual assault. They may also consent to the preven\u00ad tion and treatment of pregnancy and the diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. 3. Crime victim compensation Inform the patient, parent, or guardian about the availability of crime victim com\u00ad pensation. B. EXAMINATIONS REQUESTED BY CHILD PROTECTIVE AGENCIES-OBTAIN SIGNATURE TO AUTHORIZE PAYMENT AT PUBLIC EXPENSE OR OBTAIN A TELEPHONE AUTHORIZATION PURSUANT TO LOCAL AGREEMENTS C. OBTAIN IDENTIFYING INFORMATION ABOUT THE PATIENT-NOTIFY CHILD PROTECTIVE AGENCIES OF KNOWN OR SUSPECTED CHILD ABUSE 61 Physical examiners are not required to complete this portion of the interview. Trained personnel such as a nurse, social worker, or patient coordinator may interview and record patient history on OCJP 925. 1-6. Record patient information 7-8. Record the name, agency, identification number, and telephone number of the person taking the report and the responding officer D. OBTAIN PATIENT HISTORY 1. Record the name of the person providing the history, the relationship to the child, their address, and telephone number a. Prior to interviewing the child, obtain information from the parents/ caretakers, the law enforcement officer, child protective services worker, referring physi\u00ad cian, or mental health professional. This information should not be obtained in the presence of the child. b. Interview the child alone, if possible, or allow the presence of an adult re\u00ad quested by the child. c. If the child is emotionally traumatized, do not conduct an interview beyond what is needed for essential clinical decisions. 2. Record the chief complaint(s) of the person providing the history Detailed investigative interviewing is the responsibility of law enforcement or child protective services. 3. Record the chief complaint(s) in the child's own words Do not paraphrase the information provided by the child or record information a provided by others in this space. ., 4. Record when the incident (s) took place, the location, and whether there were multiple incidents a. If the incident (s) took place within the past 72 hours, check the box and record the date, time, and location. b. If more than 72 hours have elapsed since the incident (s) took place, check the box and record the date(s) or time frame and location. 5. Record the name, if known, the age, sex, and race of the perpetrator, and the relationship to the child a. Inquire if there has been more than one perpetrator and, if yes, record the same information for all persons identified. b. Some genetic marker variants are race-dependent. In cases where the identi\u00ad ty of the perpetrator is unknown, this information is used to determine which crime laboratory tests are indicated. 6. Record the acts described by the patient and lor person providing the history a. This information is necessary to guide the medical examination and for inter\u00ad pretation of crime laboratory tests. A careful patient history must be taken as some patients may be reluctant to describe all acts committed, particularly anal penetration. b. By law, any penetration, however slight, of the labia or rectum by the penis or any penetration of a genital or anal opening by a foreign object or body part constitutes the act. The legal definitions of oral copulation and masturbation only require contact. Any touching of a child with sexual intent constitutes child molestation. 62 c. If there was more than one perpetrator, identify which person committed which acts. 7. Record postassault hygiene/activity, if the incident occurred within 72 hours of the examination This information is relevant because it can affect the laboratory analysis of evi\u00ad dence. If the patient has bathed, showered, or douched, the examiner should still collect samples from the appropriate body orifices to attempt to preserve any trace evidence. S. Record the symptoms described by the patient and/or person providing history Record physical, behavioral, or emotional symptoms described by the patient and/ or person providing history. Use the space provided to record additional information if necessary. See Indicators of Child Sexual Abuse (page 57) E. OBTAIN PERTINENT PAST MEDICAL HISTORY All information recorded on OCJP 925 is admissible in court. Only information essential to interpreting laboratory or physical findings should be recorded on the form. 1. Record gynecological information regarding age of menarche, date of last menstrual period, use of tampons, and history of vaginitis a. For pubertal patients, obtain menstrual history to determine whether the patient is menstruating at the time of the examination and to evaluate the possibility of pregnancy and postcoital options. b. Obtain history about tampon use to determine whether there has been previ\u00ad ous vaginal penetration. c. Obtain history of vaginitis as sexually transmitted disease (STD) may become asymptomatic even though the organism may still be cultured. d. Record other information such as medications, allergies, and general past medical history in a separate medical chart. See Possibility of Pregnancy (page 91) 2. Note preexisting physical injuries Identify injuries occurring prior to and independent of the chief complaint (s) (e.g., fractured arm, lacerations, or bruising) to clarify all findings. Consider the possibil\u00ad ity of child physical abuse. Bite marks from animals or other children should be documented. 3. Record pertinent medical history of anal-genital injuries, surgeries, diag\u00ad nostic procedures, or medical treatment Obtain this information to avoid confusing lesions with injuries related to the alleged abuse. 4. Record previous history of child abuse if known F. CONDUCT A GENERAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AND RECORD FINDINGS\u00ad COLLECT AND PRESERVE EVIDENCE FOR EVIDENTIAL EXAMINATION 1. Record blood pressure, pulse, temperature, respiration, height, and weight and include percentiles for children under age six 2. Conduct a general physical examination (head to toe) for injuries and other evidence of the reported abuse a. Record general physical condition noting any abnormalities. 63 b. Record the location, size, and appearance of injuries on the OCJP 925 dia\u00ad grams. Note swelling and areas of tenderness. Signs of injury may include erythema, abrasions j bruises, contusions, induration, lacerations, fractures, bites, burns, or stains. c. Examine for evidence of physical neglect, e.g., undernourishment, uncleanli\u00ad ness, or lack of dental care, and record observations. See Procedures for Bite Marks and Bruises (page 22) Photographic Evidence (page 22) d. For patients examined within 72 hours of the incident: (1) If applicable, note condition of clothing worn during the incident upon arrival (rips, tears, foreign materials).

Prepubertal girls: Nonintact hymen and/or enlarged vaginal orifice. (1) Only conduct a speculum exam if major trauma is present. Use a pediat\u00ad ric speculum. If the genital exam reveals significant trauma, consider consultation with an appropriate specialist and/or performing the exam i- 65 nation under general anesthesia. If there are questionable findings, consider referral to a child sexual abuse specialist. (2) For patients examined within 72 hours of the incident: (a) Collect up to three swabs from the vaginal pool. Use pre moistened or urethral swabs for younger children, if necessary. (b) Prepare one wet mount and two dry mount slides. Examine for spermatozoa and Trichomonas. Code the swabs and slides to enable the crime laboratory to determine which slide was made from which swab, e.g., vaginal swab # 1, vaginal slide # 1. Indicate which slide was used for the wet mount examination. See Preparation and Examination of Wet Mount Slide for Pres\u00ad ence of Sperm (page 23) (c) Collect a specimen for gonorrhea culture from the vagina as a base line. Take other STD cultures as indicated. c. For adolescent girls, see page 48 for examination of the vagina. d.

(5) Vulvovaginal or urethral discharge Note presence of discharge in terms of amount (scant, moderate, copi\u00ad ous) color, and presence of odor. Identify source, e.g., vagina, urethra. (6) Condyloma acuminata (genital warts) Note presence of condyloma and record location on anal-genital dia\u00ad grams. b. Female children The examination the labia majora to observe the genital structures. If the child is relaxed in the frog-leg or knee-chest position, the vaginal in\u00ad troitus will gradually open to reveal its maximal size. Do not insert fingers to determine the size of the hymenal opening or its patency. Variation exists among normal children. It also varies with age and examination position. (2) Labia majora Note any lesions, unusual pigmentation, or chronic skin changes. (3) Clitoris Note unusual size or changes of the clitoris or hood. (4) Labia Minora Note injuries, color changes, or other abnormalities. (5) Periurethral tissue/urethral meatus Note inflammation, edema, or other changes of periurethral tissue. (6) Perihymenal tissue (vestibule) Note increase in vascularity, abrasions, or lacerations. (7) Hymen (a) Draw shape of hymen on the anal-genital diagram. 6? t';I\"'r-~:r--:----:-'~~--~--~~------------~---~~----~-- ------- --- - - ----- ii (b) Record transhymenal vertical and I or horizontal diameter and the examination position (supine or knee-chest). The diameter varies with age and the state of relaxation. (c) Record whether the hymen is intact or nonintact. Include notations of hymenal changes such as: significant distortion of the normal shape, fresh tears, transections, fresh hemorrhages, abrasions. bruises or ecchymotic areas, healed scars or adhesions, rounded or thickened edges. and abnormal vascular patterns. (8) Posterior Fourchette Note lacerations or scars of healed lacerations. bruises, healing abrad\u00ad ed areas, or neovascularization (the growth of new blood vessels). A normal midline raphe should not be confused with a scar. (9) Fossa navicularis This area, immediately posterior to the vaginal introitus and bounded by the posterior fourchette, may display abnormal vascular patterns or scars secondary to the trauma of attempted or intracrural intercourse. (10) Vagina Note any bleeding, discharge, foreign bodies. abnormal vascular pat\u00ad terns, petechiae, or other lesions on the walis of the vagina. (11) Examination position Record examination position used. c. Male children The examination should include the penis. urethral meatus, scrotum, and testes. (1) Penis Note whether circumcised or not. (2) Urethral meatus Note any scars or unusual lesions and indicate whether they are fresh or healed. (3) Scrotum Note any erythema, ecchymosis, or unusual lesions. (4) Testes Note size of testicle to determine whether the child has entered puberty. Male testicles are ordinarily less than two centimeters in diameter in prepubertal boys. d. Femalel male anus and rectum (1) Buttocks Note fresh or healed lesions. ecchymosis. or rashes. (2) Perianal skin Examine for inflammation and record on the anal-genital diagrams the approximate width of zone of pigmentation.

Note whether fissures, tears, or lacerations are located on the external mucosal sur\u00ad face, internal to the sphincter, or extend across the pectinate line which is the juncture between the anal mucosa and the anal epithelium. 68 (3) Anal verge/folds/rugae Note whether the verge or anal sphincter skin folds appear to be promi\u00ad nent, normal or flattened when the child is relaxed. (4) Tone (a) Anal spasm A digital or visual examination may be performed to assess sphincter tone. At this time, disagreement exists as to whether a digital examination, an invasive procedure. is necessary to assess tone. Concurrence of the patient is recommended. Anal spasm is usually manifested by an increase in muscle tone on digital exami\u00ad nation. Record the method used to assess anal tone. (b) Anal laxity Estimate or measure the transverse and vertical diameter of any anal dilation. Note the length of time required to reach maximum dilation and whether it was constant or intermittent. Record the presence or absence of stool in the rectal ampulla since the former may lead to reflex dilation of the anal sphincter. Only enough lateral traction to separate the buttocks should be applied. An anus which dilates greater than 15 millimeters in transverse diameter with gentle buttock traction with the child in the knee-chest posi\u00ad tion and without stool present is considered a significant indicator. (5) Examination position Record examination position used. (6) Anoscopy or proctoscopy Record whether an anoscopic or proctoscopiC examination was per\u00ad formed. (7) Method of examination Record whether the anal-genital examination was performed with direct visualization, colposcope, or hand-held magnifier. Record whether photographs were taken on OCJP 925 (Part F, Item #7). 7. Clinical tests, evidence, and reference samples from patient Test tube top colors listed below are provided for reference. The colors corre\u00ad spond to commercial test tubes that contain necessary preservatives. These references are not intended to preclude those jurisdictions that prepare their own test tubes, using proper preservatives and different colored tops, from doing so. a. Clinical tests (1) Take blood for base line syphilis serology (red top tube) and provide prophylaxis. (2) Obtain a pregnancy test for pubertal girls (either blood or urine) which has a sensitivity of less than 50 mili-international units HCG. See Treatment of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (page 93) Possibility of Pregnancy (page 91) b. Evidence Collect the samples listed below for alcohol and toxicology, if age-appropri\u00ad ate, at the discretion of the examiner and/or law enforcement officer In accordance with local procedures. Swab the arm with a nonalcoholic solution to avoid elevating the blood/alcohol level. 69 ,;n~\";:'1~~<;'7l''!~''''';f\"-:- .. -------:-------------------- -- ----------- - --- - ------- (1) Blood alcohol/toxicology, if within 24 hours of assault (grey top tube). (2) Urine specimen (collect after pelvic examination, if possible). c. Reference samples Collection of reference samples in children is only necessary if evidence specimens such as blood, hair, and secretions have been collected and there is a need to compare them to a suspected assailant. Reference samples can be collected at the time of the examination or at a later date according to the policies of the local crime laboratory. (1) Blood typing (yellow top tube-ACD Solution B) (2) Saliva reference specimen (a) With clean forceps or tweezers, place a clean gauze, filter paper, or cotton pledget under the tongue and allow it to remain there until saturated. Swabs can also be used for this purpose. Do not handle the sample with the fingers; use tweezers or forceps. (b) Air dry, package in an envelope. Label and seal. (3) Pubic and head hair samples Follow local crime laboratory standards. (a) Head Hair: Cut the hairs close to the skin or pluck at least 15 to 20 hairs from the various regions of the scalp (crown, temple, etc.) which represent the range of length and colors present. (b) Pubic Hair: Cut the hairs close to the skin or pluck at least 15 to 20 hairs from different areas of the pubic region which represent the variations of length and color. See Reference Samples (page 18) Collection of Specimens from Pubic Hair (page 25) d. Record the samples collected on OCJP 925 (Part F, Item #7). 8. Treatment a. Appropriately treat and refer for repair all injuries. b. Ascertain tetanus prophylaxis status and provide appropriate inoculations. c. Provide prophylaxis for sexually transmitted disease.

Physical force is almost always used on male victims and the level of physical brutality appears to be greater than for females. Also, a greater likelihood of multiple perpetrators exists for male than female victims. Reports on male sexual victimization are rare as male victims are reluctant to disclose sexual assault for three major reasons: Societal beliefs that a man is expected to be able to defend himself, especially against sexual assault; The victim's fear that his sexual preference may become suspect; and Men are taught to be in control of their emotions and disclosure is highly stressful. Men may experience the attack as an assault on their masculinity and strength and, as a result, may reject assistance that makes them feel weak or vulnerable. The crisis reactions of males progress through similar stages of emotional adjustment as adult females experiencing rape trauma syndrome (Burgess and Holmstrom, 1974). This type of trauma is also identified as post-traumatic stress disorder. (DSM III, Anxiety Disorders, 309.30 and 309.31 ). Rape trauma syndrome has two phases: the immediate or acute phase and the long-term reorganization or assimilation phase. A. IMMEDIATE CRISIS REACTIONS Emotional and behavioral stress reactions indicative of the acute phase include: Numbness Shock and disbelief, dazed or bewildered presentation Diminished alertness, cognitive confusion Flat affect, psychological distancing, and preoccupation Dulled sensory, affective, and memory functions Feelings of terror Fearfulness, anxiety, or hysteria Outward calm and collectedness \u00b08. SUBSEQUENT EMOTIONAL REACT'.ONS Emotional and behavioral stress reactions, which may last for several months or even years and cause significant disruption in the victim's life, include: Continuing fear and anxiety Sense of helplessness Persistent fear or depression Mood swings \" Denial Sleep disturbances (e.g., vivid dreams, recurrent nightmares, insomnia, and wakefulness) Somatic symptoms Appetite disturbances Poor concentration 75 Preoccupation with the event including flashbacks Self-blame, guilt, and shame Concerns about sexuality Depressive symptoms Phobic reactions Withdrawal from peers and friends C. SUPPORTIVE APPROACH Crisis intervention theory, which describes clusters of emotions proceeding through the phases of active crisis, reintegration or crisis resolution, and normalization, pro\u00ad vides a theoretical framework for understanding and responding to the patient. Psy\u00ad chological reactions may be experienced with varying degrees of intensity as the person progresses through each stage of emotional adjustment. Cultural differences, life-stage issues, mental or physical disabilities, and previous victimization may intensify the psychological trauma experienced by the patient. Deve\u00ad lopmentally disabled, hearing impaired, and other handicapped individuals are espe\u00ad cially at risk for sexual victimization and require particularly sensitive treatment. Examining practitioners must demonstrate nonjudgmental, sympathetic approaches, especially with respect for the male victim's need to protect his sense of masculinity, to assist with the reduction of acute psychological trauma and its afteraffects. See the State of California Medical Protocol Informational Guide for additional information on psychological and sociocultural factors. 76 Adult Male Evidential Examination Sexual assault patients should be assigned priority in triage along with other serious emergencies. If the incident(s) occurred within the past 72 hours, the examination must be conducted without delay to minimize loss or deterioration of evidence. The hospital should develop a system for rapidly escorting patients to a private area. A trained, support person (patient coordinator) should be assigned. The lettered and numbered sections below correspond ttl the lettered and numbered sections of OCJP 923. A. OBTAIN IDENTIFYING INFORMATION ABOUT THE PAYIENT AND NOTIFY AU\u00ad THORITIES OF CRIME-RELATED INJURIES Physical examiners are not required to complete this portion 01' the interview. Trained personnel such as a nurse, social worker, or patient coordinatm may interview and record patient history on OCJP 923. B. OBTAIN PATIENT CONSENT 1. Patients requesting examination and treatment only Inform the patient of the state law requiring hospitals to report treatment request\u00ad ed for crime-related injuries and obtain consent for treatment. 2. Patients requesting examination, treatment, and evidence collection a. Obtain the patient's signed consent for the examination. b. Obtain the patient's signed consent to photograph injuries. c. inform the patient about the availability of crime victim compensation. C. OBTAIN THE SIGNATURE OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER TO AUTHOR\u00ad IZE PAYMENT FOR THE EVIDENTIAL EXAMINATION AT PUBLIC EXPENSE OR OBTAIN A TELEPHONE AU\"rHORIZATION PURSUANT TO LOCAL AGREE\u00ad MENTS D. OBTAIN PATIENT HISTORY 1. Record the name of the person providing the history, the relationship to the patient, and the date and time of the assault(s) 2. Record the location and physical surroundings of the assault(s) If the incident occurred within 72 hours of the examination, the body and clothing should be observed for evidence from the scene of the assault, e.g., grass, sand, glass, or fibers. 3. Record the name(s), if known, the number, and race(s) of the perpe\u00ad trator(s) Seme genetic marker variants are race-dependent. This information is used to determine which crime laboratory tests are indicated. 4. Record the acts described by the patient a. This information is necessary to guide the medical examination and for inter\u00ad pretation of crime laboratory tests. A careful patient history must be taken as some patients may be reluctant to describe all acts committed, particularly anal penetration. b. By law, any penetration, however slight, of the rectum by the penis, a foreign object, or body part constitutes the act. The legal definitions of oral copulation and masturbation only require contact. 77 \"1~r.'.~-----,------:~--- ----------------------- ;~' c. If there was more than one perpetrator, identify which person committed which acts. 5. Record physical injuries and/or pain described by the patient and the area(s) of the body affected This information should be used to direct the physician to look for injury and evidence not readily visible. Identify injuries occurring prior to and independent of the assault (e.g., fractured arm, lacerations, or bruising) to clarify all findings. 6. Record threats, types of force, or other methods used by the perpe\u00ad trator(s) and the area(s) of the body affected a. This information should be used to direct the physician to look for injury and evidence not readily visible. It may also indicate the need for special docu~ mentation, such as photography, or a need for a repeat examination 24 to 72 hours later to observe development of bruises. b. If coercion t intimidation, psychological pressure, and/or abuse of position of trust were employedt record the method (s) used under \"other.1t 7. Record postassault hygiene/activity if the incident occurred within 72 hours of the examination This information is relevant because it can affect the laboratory analysis of evi\u00ad dence. If the patient has bathed or showered, the examiner should still collect samples from the appropriate body orifices to attempt to preserve any trace evidence. 8. Record pertinent medical information All information on OCJP 923 is admissible in court. Only information essential to interpreting laboratory or physical findings should be recorded on the form. a. Obtain information on anal-genital injuries, surgeries, diagnostiC procedurest or medical treatment within the past 60 days to avoid confusing lesions with injuries related to the alleged assault. Check the appropriate box. If yes, record the information in a separate patient medical chart. b. Ascertain whether the patient has had consenting intercourse within the past 72 hours and record the approximate date and time. This information is required by the crime laboratory as it can effect analysis of evidence. c.

The State of California Medical Protocol for the Examination of Sexual Assault and Child Sexual Abuse Victims contains detailed Instructions for conducting these examinations. Office of Criminal Justice Planning State of California George Deukmejian, Governor 83 SECTION XI Male Suspect Evidential Examination The points listed below are intended to guide the emergency department to prepare for the examination of a sexual assault suspect. Examinations of suspects are likely to yield useful information particularly if con\u00ad ducted within hours of the alleged assault, although injuries such as lacerations, bruises, and bites can be observed after a longer period of time. The persistence of most evidence is dependent on activities of the suspect after the assault such as bathing, changing clothes, etc. Contact between the victim and the suspect should be prevented. Once the emergency room is notified by law enforcement personnel that a suspect is to be brought into the emergency department, ascertain whether the victim will also be brought to the hospital. If so, arrange for appropriate rooms or times for the examinations to prevent contact between them. Security precautions should be taken when a suspect is brought to the emergency department by law enforcement officials. The suspect should be escorted to a private room as soon as possible, and a law enforcement officer should be present with the suspect at all times. Information about the alleged assault should be obtained from the law enforce\u00ad ment officer prior to beginning the examination. This information is necessary to direct the examiner to look for injury and evidence not readily visible. Questions should be asked regarding: Date and time of alleged assault; Alleged acts; Location and physical surroundings of the assault; and Any physical identifying information provided by the victim such as scars, tattoos, etc. Record the information obtained from the law enforcement officer on a separate worksheet and use it for reference during the examination. Do not record this information on OCJP 923. Use those portions of OCJP 923 which are applicable to record identifying information, medical history, physical examination findings, and evidence collection. Accept and record the suspect's statement if it is volun\u00ad teered. Suspects should be given the respect and medical treatment that any patient deserves. Medical professionals must remain objective and avoid the assumption that the suspect is guilty. The lettered and numbered sections below correspond to the lettered and numbered sections on OCJP 923. A. OBTAIN IDENTIFYING INFORMATION ABOUT THE SUSPECT Physical examiners are not required to complete this portion of the interview. Trained personnel such as a nurse, social worker, or patient coordinator may interview and record the patient history on OCJP 923. 85 B.

Treatment Treatment for injuries, venereal disease, and tetanus prophylaxis may be initiated if appropriate. If treatment is not initiated and the suspect is in custody, an appropriate referral to a treating physician at the local jail or holding facility should be made. 89 SECTION XII POSSIBILITY OF PREGNANCY A. ASSESS THE RISK OF PREGNANCY 1. Probabilities a. The probability of conception from a single, random, unprotected intercourse is estimated to be between two and four percent. b. The probability of conception from a single, unprotected, midcycle inter\u00ad course (days 11 to 18 of a 28-day cycle) is at least 10 percent and may be as high as 30 percent if the exposure was on the estimated day of ovulation. 2. Other variables Determination of the probability of conception is also dependent on other varia\u00ad bles, e.g., the use of contraceptives, regularity of menstrual cycle, fertility of the patient and the alleged perpetrator, time in the cycle of the exposure, and whether the perpetrator ejaculated intravaginally. B. BASE LINE PREGNANCY TEST Base line tests are conducted at the time of the examination to determine if the patient was pregnant at the time of the assault or whether sexual abuse of a pubertal girl resulted in pregnancy. If an existing pregnancy is a possibility, the results of the base line pregnancy test should be received prior to prescribing estrogens or inserting an intrauterine devic\") (IUD) to prevent pregnancy. C. ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS 1. Pregnancy test. Obtain a pregnancy test (either blood or urine) which has a sensitivity of less than 50 mili-international units of HCG. 2. Discuss probabilities with patient Discuss the probability of pregnancy with the patient given the different variables described above. Women of various ages, social, and religious backgrounds will have differing feelings regarding the treatment options most acceptable to them. Major concerns include the patient's attitude toward conception and abortion and the desire to reduce the smallest risk of pregnancy as a result of a sexual assault. 3. Discuss all medically appropriate alternatives a. Immediate treatment (1) Postcoital hormonal therapy (2) Postcoital insertion of an intrauterine device (IUD) (Note: IUD's studied for use as postcoital contraception, Copper 7s and Copper Ts, are no longer manufactured.) (3) Menstrual extraction before diagnosis of pregnancy b. No immediate treatment and patient decides to wait a minimum of ten days to determine if conception did occur. (1) No pregnancy (2) Menstrual extraction performed within two weeks of conception (3) Therapeutic abortion 91 {4) Continue pregnancy and refer patient to a family planning agency, adop\u00ad tion agency, or county department of social services 4. Postcoital hormonal therapy a. Ovral is recommended as the treatment of choice for postcoital hormonal therapy. (1) Ovral contains 50 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol and .5 micrograms of dl-norgestrel.

No firm data have been developed to estimate the risk of a sexually assaulted person contracting a sexually transmitted infection. Based on the prevalence of infections in the general population, the most likely diseases for which these patients are at risk appear to be chlamydial infections, gonorrhea, genital herpes. cytomegalovirus I and trichomonia\u00ad sis. Recent studies are showing higher prevalence rates of Chlamydia trachomatis than gonorrhea among adults and adolescents. If the offender is at high risk for having syphilis or hepatitis B, the victim has an increased risk of acquiring these diseases. A. EXAMINATION OF ADULT OR ADOLESCENT SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS 1. Standard STD tests a. Discuss the possibility of contracting sexually transmitted disease and trea\\\u00ad ment recommendations with the patient. b. The initial examination of the patient should include cultures for Neisseria gonorrhea from any potentially infected site, a serologic test for syphilis, and a bimanual examination. c. Conduct base line tests indicated by the history of contact and offer prophy\u00ad laxis. 2. Other STD tests See the State of California Medical Protocol Informational Guide for additional information on chlamydia and other sexually transmitted disease. 3. Prophylaxis Single dose treatments at the time of the initial examination are advantageous for sexual assault victims as compliance and follow-up with multiple dose regimes is often low. a. Single dose regime (effective for gonorrhea and incubating syphilis) Recommended single dose treatments include: 4.8 million units of procaine penicillin intramuscularly or oral amoxicillin 3.0 gm or oral ampicillin 3.5 gm, all given with 1.0 gm of oral probenecid. b. Multiple dose regimes (effective against chlamydia as well as gonorrhea and syphilis) In view of the frequent association of gonorrhea and chlamydia, prophylaxiS against both is prudent. A recommended approach is the combination of single dose therapy followed by a multiple dose regime. Tetracycline, 500 mg by mouth, 4 times daily, for 7 days; or doxycycline, 100 mg by mouth, twice daily, for 7 days. c. Pregnant women should not be treated with tetracycline due to potential adverse effects on the fetus. d. Patients allergic to tetracycline or penicillin may be treated with spectinomy\u00ad cin, erythromycin, or several cephalosporins. Refer to U.S. Center for Disease Control guidelines. 93 4. Follow-up care a. Patients should be seen for medical follow-up in seven days and the afore\u00ad mentioned tests repeated to assure successful prophylaxis. Patients should be scheduled for syphilis follow-up testing six weeks later because of the longer incubation period. b. Every effort should be made to establish whether the perpetrator is infected with a sexually transmitted disease to ensure that patients receive treatment for exposure to venereal disease documented in the perpetrator. c. Consideration should be given to the possibility of exposure to AIDS (Ac\u00ad quired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) and hepatitis B. Appropriate tests should be conducted if indicated. Current California law regarding AIDS testing states: No person shall test a person's blood for evidence of antibodies to the probable causative agent of AIDS without the written consent of the subject of the test, and the person giving the test shall have a written statement signed by the subject confirming that he or she obtained the consent from the subject. Written authorization is required for each separate disclosure of the test results, and shall include to whom the disclosure would be made. (Health and Safety Code Sections 199.20-199.22) B. EVALUATION OF CHILDREN FOR SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE 1. Females a. Take Neisseria gonorrhea culture from oropharynx, rectum, and the vaginal introitus for prepubertal girls with intact hymen and normal vaginal the vagina in prepubertal girls nonintact hymen andlor enlarged vaginal orifice, and the endocervix in adolescents. b. Consider Chlamydia cultures or rapid test from oropharynx, vagina, and rec\u00ad tum in all children 11 years of age or older and from younger children with a history of symptoms compatible with infection. c. Perform trichomonas and herpes simplex testing if symptoms are present. d. Perform serologic tests for syphilis. e. Conduct examination for venereal warts. f. Conduct examination for vaginitis using such tests as a wet mount for clue cells, potassium hydroxide (I<OH) whiff test, and routine cultures. 2. Males a. Take Neisseria gonorrhea culture from oropharynx, rectum, and urethra. culture from and ure- thra if indicated. c. Perform herpes simplex testing if symptoms are present. d. Perform serologic tests for syphilis. e. Conduct examination for venereal warts. 3. Prophylaxis a. Prophylactic therapy is recommended when the child has had contact with an individual known to have gonococcal infection, or has been sexually as\u00ad saulted by a stranger, or when the physician suspects the child will not be returned for follow-up. b. Treatment of gonorrhea can be accomplished with 50 mglkg of amoxicillin, up to 3 gm in a single oral dose, along with 25 mg/kg of probenecid, orally. This treatment is also effective with incubating syphilis. 94 c. Children who are allergic to penicillin should be treated with spectinomycin, 40 mg/kg 1 m. Children older than 8 years may be treated with tetracycline, 40 mg/kg/day orally in four divided doses for five days. This regimen is also effective against chlamydial infection. d. Chlamydial infection in children under 8 years may be treated with oral ery\u00ad thromycin ethylsuccinate, 50 mg/kg/day in four doses for 10 to 14 days. e. Trichomoniasis and nonspecific vaginitis (NSV) can be treated with oral metronidazole. 4. Follow-up care Repeat tests should be conducted at the same intervals as adults. 95 --~-~- ----~ ~------- SECTION XIV FOLLOW-UP PATIENT CARE Following the examination, time should be spent discussing with the patient any issues which may have arisen during the course of the examination. Examiners should refer to the introductory sections of the protocol pertaining to females, males, and children to help the patient anticipate feelings, fears, or concerns. See the State of California Medical Protoco/lnformational Guide for additional information on long term treatment needs. A. WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS Follow-up instructions and referrals should be given in writing. B. PSYCHOLOGICAL SEQUELAE Discuss the possibility of psychological sequelae with patients of appropriate age and their family members. Reassure patients and parents of child victims about the pres\u00ad ence or absence of physical injury. All patients need to be told that they are not to blame for what happened to them. Children especially need reassurance due to fear of consequences or punishment for disclosure or the child's role in the incident. Provide referrals to a local rape crisis center, child sexual abuse treatment program, victim/witness program, mental health center, or local psychotherapist. C. CRIME VICTIM COMPENSATION Discuss the availability of crime victim compensation. Refer the patient to the local victim/witness program. These programs provide assistance in preparing claims for submission to the State Board of Control Victim's of Crime Program. Refer the patient to the State Board of Control if no local program exists. D. FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS Arrange follow-up appointments for suture removal and wound checks as indicated; repeat testing in seven days for venereal cultures and in six weeks for syphilis to ensure successful prophylaxis; and repeat pregnancy testing. E. PATIENT TRANSPORTATION Arrange transportation for patients after the evidential examination when needed. 97 APPENDIX A Senate Bill No. 892 CHAPTER 812 An ~ct to add Section 1281 to, and to repeal Sections 1493 and 1494 of, the Health and Safety Code, and to repeal and add Section 13823.5 of, and to add Sections 13823.7, 13823.9, and 13823.11 to, the Penal Code, relating to sexual assaults. [Approved by Governor September 19, 1985. Filed with Secretary of State September 19,1985.] LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST SB 892, Seymour. Sexual assaults: examination and treatment. Existing law requires the State Department of Health Services to adopt a protocol for the examination of a victim of rape or other sexual assault and guidelines for the treatment of any such victim. The protocol and the guidelines are required to be used by medical personnel in county hospitals. The department, in cooperation with the Department ofjustice, also is required to adopt a standard form for recordation of medical data disclosed by examination of such a victim; the form is required to be used by physicians in a county hospital and any other general acute care hospital who examine such a victim. Existing law also requires the advisory committee established by the Office of Criminal Justice Planning to establish standardized procedures for the collection of evidence from victims of sexual assaults and attempted sexual assaults who are treated in hospital emergency rooms. This bill would repeal those provisions requiring the State Department of Health Seryices to perform the functions specified above and would require the Office of Criminal Justice Planning, with the assistance of the advisory committee, to develop a protocol and guidelines for the examination and treatment of victims of sexual assault and attempted s~xual assault, including child molestation, and the collection and preservation of evidence therefrom. It also would specify certain standards for such an examination and the collection and preservation of evidence. It would require all general acute care hospitals, whether public or private, either to comply with these standards and the protocol and guidelines or to adopt a protocol referring victims of these crimes to a hospital that so complies, thus establishing a state-mandated local program as the requirement would be applicable to various local public hospitals. The bill also would require the Office of Criminal Justice Planning, in cooperation with the State Department of Health Services and the Department of Justice, to adopt a standard form for the recordation of medical data disclosed by examination of a victim of sexual assault or attempted sexual assault, including child molestation, as specified. 9450 99 Ch.812 -2- The bill also would make related changes. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain' costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement, including the creation of a S~ate Mandates Claims Fund to pay the costs of mandates which do not exceed $500,000 statewide and other procedures for claims whose statewide costs exceed $500,000. This bill would provide that no reimbursement shall be made from the State Mandates Claims Fund for costs mandated by the state pursuant to this act, but would recognize that local agencies and school districts may pursue any available remedies to seek reimbursement for these costs. It also would make an additional statement as to the lack of an appropriation reimbursing local agencies for costs. This bill would provide that, notwithstanding Section 2231.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, this bill does not contain a repealer, as required by that section; therefore, the provisions of the bill would remain in effect unless and until they are amended or repealed by a later enacted bill. The people of the State of Caljfornia do enact as follows: SECTION 1. Section 12.81 is added. to the Health and Safety Code, to read: 1281.

The probability of conception from a single, random, unprotected intercourse is estimated to be . between two and four percent. 2.
