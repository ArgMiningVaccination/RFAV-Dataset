What Are Essential Oils? Essential oils are a natural product that come from plants. Within these plants, you can find chemical compounds with high levels of potency. These compounds are natural, concentrated, and can typically be found in the plant's roots, stems, leaves, or flowers. These are also the compounds that function to produce the fragrance of plants. The scent of these essential oils is necessary for the plant to function in nature. The aroma works to protect the plant from environmental hazards and even certain dangerous conditions that can harm them.

We all have feelings & senses that trigger negativity that can manifest in our mind, body, and soul. Bad energy can trap you at certain times, but luckily, there are ways you can resist the negativity. Depending on the source of this negativity, there is probably an essential oil that can help you avoid or get away from the bad energy. 1. Lavender Oil: Calm & resist anxiety Anxious or nervous feelings can feel suffocating at times, and it causes a very negative mindset and emotional state. The soothing aroma of lavender oil has been [researched and shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3612440/) to provide a calming effect on your nervous system and mental state. Many people use lavender oil to remove negative & anxious feelings that prevent them from getting a good night's sleep, too. That being said, being well-rested and calm can help you start your day with positive energy. 2. Peppermint Oil: Reverse your negative mental state If you feel like your mind is full of bad energy, troubling thoughts, or even stress- peppermint oil can help you refresh and regain mental clarity. [A 2019 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6814313/) looks at the effects of peppermint oil aromatherapy and concludes that it can \"attenuate\" feelings of pain and anxiety, meaning that it works to reduce the force of these feelings. 3.

Tea Tree Oil: Clear the air & purify your environment Bad energy doesn't just come from stressful situations or negative feelings.

When these negative ions are released, it encourages our minds to shift into a more positive state. 7. Eucalyptus Oil: Release a breath of fresh air Bad breath is something that can completely ruin the mood. When you have stinky breath, it makes it uncomfortable for the person you're talking to and may leave them with a bad feeling associated with you. Many underlying factors may cause a foul odor from your breath, but eucalyptus oil can help eliminate them. Eucalyptus oil has antimicrobial benefits that can help kill the bad breath germs in your mouth so that you can give off fresh energy (and odor) around others. 8.

When you are surrounded by energy that makes you feel apathetic, lemon oil can reactivate your enthusiasm. 9.

However, a [2014 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25076278/) showed that ylang-ylang oil can boost feelings of self-esteem when used through aromatherapy. If you start to lack confidence, ylang-ylang might help you restore a positive self-image. 10.
