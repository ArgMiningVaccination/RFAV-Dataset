The company does business as Merck Sharp & Dohme or MSD outside the United States and Canada. It is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, generally ranking in the global top five by revenue. [[5]](#cite_note-5) [[6]](#cite_note-6) Merck & Co. was originally established as the American affiliate of Merck Group in 1891. Merck develops and produces medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies and animal health products. It has multiple blockbuster drugs or products each with 2020 revenues including cancer immunotherapy, anti-diabetic medication and vaccines against [HPV](/wiki/HPV) and [chickenpox](/wiki/Chickenpox). The is ranked 71st on [medicines](/wiki/Medicine), [vaccines](/wiki/Vaccine), biologic therapies and [animal health](/wiki/Animal_health) products. In 2020, the company had 6 [blockbuster drugs](/wiki/Blockbuster_drug) or products, each with over billion in 2020 revenue; [Gardasil](/wiki/Gardasil), an vaccine](/wiki/HPV_vaccine) Varivax, a [varicella vaccine](/wiki/Varicella_vaccine) used to protect against 2020 23, a [pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine](/wiki/Pneumococcal_polysaccharide_vaccine) that had $1.1 billion in 2020 revenue. Other major products by the company include Isentress ( [raltegravir](/wiki/Raltegravir)), an [antiretroviral medication](/wiki/Antiretroviral_medication) used to 2020 revenue; RotaTeq, [rotavirus vaccine](/wiki/Rotavirus_vaccine) revenue; and Lynparza ( [olaparib](/wiki/Olaparib)), a medication for the maintenance treatment of BRCA-mutated advanced [ovarian cancer](/wiki/Ovarian_cancer) in adults that generated $725 million in 2020 revenue for the company. [[1]](#cite_note-10K-1) Details of Merck's major products are as follows: [Januvia](/wiki/Januvia)(sitagliptin) is a dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In 2013, Januvia was the second largest selling diabetes drug worldwide. [[9]](#cite_note-9)Januvia is commonly paired with the generic anti-diabetes drug [metformin](/wiki/Metformin). It has been popular due in part because unlike many other diabetes drugs, it causes little or no weight gain and is not associated with hypoglycemic episodes. [[10]](#cite_note-10) [[11]](#cite_note-11)Merck also sells a single pill combination drug containing both Januvia and metformin under the trade name Janumet. There has been some concern that treatment with Januvia and other DPP-IV inhibitors may be associated with a modestly increased risk of pancreatitis. [[12]](#cite_note-12) [Zetia](/wiki/Zetia)(ezetimibe) is a drug for hypercholesterolemia that acts by inhibiting the absorption of dietary cholesterol. Zetia has been controversial, as it was initially approved based on its impact on serum cholesterol levels without proof that it actually impacted the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Results of the IMPROVE-IT study, however, introduced at the 2014 Scientific Sessions of the American Heart Association, showed a statistically significant, albeit modest, benefit in adding Zetia to simvastatin for high-risk, post-acute-coronary-syndrome patients. [[13]](#cite_note-13) [Remicade](/wiki/Remicade)(infliximab) is a monoclonal antibody directed toward the cytokine [TNF-alpha](/wiki/TNF-alpha)and used for the treatment of a wide range of autoimmune disorders, including [rheumatoid inhibitors exhibit additive therapeutic effects with methotrexate and improve quality of life. Adverse effects include increased risk of infection and certain cancers. [[14]](#cite_note-14)Merck had rights to the drug in certain areas, while [Janssen Biotech](/wiki/Janssen_Biotech)had rights in other areas; [Gardasil](/wiki/Gardasil)(recombinant human papilloma virus against multiple serotypes of [human papilloma virus](/wiki/Human_papillomavirus)(HPV), which is responsible for most cases of cervical cancer worldwide. [[17]](#cite_note-17) [Isentress](/wiki/Isentress)(raltegravir) is a human immunodeficiency virus integrase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV infection. It is the first anti-HIV compound having this mechanism of action. [[18]](#cite_note-18)It is part of one of several first line treatment regimens recommended by the [United States Department of Health and Human Services](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services). [[19]](#cite_note-19) [Keytruda](/wiki/Keytruda)(pembrolizumab) is an immune modulator for the treatment of cancer. On September 4, 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved [Pembrolizumab](/wiki/Pembrolizumab)(MK-3475) as a breakthrough therapy for melanoma treatment. [[20]](#cite_note-20)In clinical trials, pembrolzumab provided partial tumor regression in about one quarter of patients, many of whom have not seen further progression of their disease in over 6 months of follow-up. [[21]](#cite_note-21) - Invanz ( [Ertapenem](/wiki/Ertapenem)) is an injectable antibiotic, rights to which Merck has owned since 1999. [[22]](#cite_note-Taiwan-22)Merck was in a legal dispute with the Taiwanese company Savior Lifetec over their attempt to secure rights to sell a [generic drug](/wiki/Generic_drug)version in the United States. [[22]](#cite_note-Taiwan-22)Savior has since obtained approval to market generic ertapenem. [[23]](#cite_note-23) [Mexsana](/wiki/Mexsana)is an antiseptic medicated powder. [Mectizan](/wiki/Mectizan)(ivermectin) is an anti-parasitic medicine traditionally used to treat [river blindness](/wiki/River_Blindness). It is the focus of Merck's Mectizan Donation Program, wherein Merck has donated doses of the drug to treat millions of people in countries such as Yemen and African nations. [Molnupiravir](/wiki/Molnupiravir)is an antiviral pill to treat [COVID-19](/wiki/COVID-19), [[24]](#cite_note-24)developed in partnership with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. Merck & Co. publishes [The Merck Manuals](/wiki/The_Merck_Manuals), a series of medical reference books for physicians, nurses, technicians, and veterinarians. These include the [Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy](/wiki/Merck_Manual_of_Diagnosis_and_Therapy), the world's best-selling medical reference. [The Merck Index](/wiki/The_Merck_Index), a compendium of chemical compounds, was published by Merck & Co. until it was acquired by the [Royal Society of Chemistry](/wiki/Royal_Society_of_Chemistry) in 2012. History[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Merck_%26_Co.&action=edit\u00a7ion=2)] Roots and early history[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Merck_%26_Co.&action=edit\u00a7ion=3)] Merck & Co. traces its origins to its former German parent company [Merck Group](/wiki/Merck_Group), which was established by the [Merck family](/wiki/Merck_family) in 1668 when [Friedrich Jacob Merck](/wiki/Friedrich_Jacob_Merck) store in [Darmstadt](/wiki/Darmstadt). [[25]](#cite_note-keyfacts-25) [[26]](#cite_note-Nonmarket-26) In 1827, Merck Group evolved from a pharmacy to a drug manufacturer company with the commercial manufacture of [morphine](/wiki/Morphine). [[27]](#cite_note-27) Merck perfected the chemical process of deriving morphine from [opium](/wiki/Opium) and later introduced [cocaine](/wiki/Cocaine), used to treat sinus problems and to add to beverages to boost energy levels. [[28]](#cite_note-28) In 1887 a German-born, long-time Merck employee, Theodore Weicker, went to the United States to represent Merck Group. In 1891, with $200,000 received from E. Merck, Weicker started Merck & Co., with headquarters in lower Manhattan. That year George Merck, the 23-year-old son of the then head of E. Merck (and grandson of the founder) joined Weicker in New York. [[29]](#cite_note-29) [[25]](#cite_note-keyfacts-25) [[26]](#cite_note-Nonmarket-26) Merck & Co. operated from 1891 to 1917 as the US subsidiary of the [Merck Group](/wiki/Merck_Group). [[26]](#cite_note-Nonmarket-26) Nationalization[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Merck_%26_Co.&action=edit\u00a7ion=4)] After the U.S. entered [World War I](/wiki/World_War_I), due to its German connections, Merck & Co. was the subject of [expropriation](/wiki/Expropriation) under the [Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917](/wiki/Trading_with_the_Enemy_Act_of_1917). In 1919, [George Merck, in partnership with](/wiki/George_W._Merck) [Goldman Sachs](/wiki/Goldman_Sachs) and [Lehman Brothers](/wiki/Lehman_Brothers), bought the company back at a U.S. government auction for $3.5 million, but Merck & Co. remained a separate company from its former German parent. [[30]](#cite_note-30) [[31]](#cite_note-31) Merck & Co. holds the trademark rights to the \"Merck\" name in the United States and Canada, while its former parent company retains the rights in the rest of the world; the right to use the Merck name was the subject of litigation between the two companies in 2016. [[32]](#cite_note-Wrangle-32) [[33]](#cite_note-33) [[34]](#cite_note-34) [[35]](#cite_note-Fight-35) In 1929, [H. K. Mulford Company](/wiki/H._K._Mulford_Company) merged with Sharp and Dohme, Inc. and brought vaccine technology, including immunization of cavalry horses in World War I and delivery of a diphtheria antitoxin to Merck & Co. In 1943, [Streptomycin](/wiki/Streptomycin) was discovered during a Merck-funded research program in [Selman Waksman's](/wiki/Selman_Waksman) laboratory at [Rutgers University](/wiki/Rutgers_University). It became the first effective treatment for [Tuberculosis](/wiki/Tuberculosis). At the time of its discovery, [sanatoriums](/wiki/Sanatorium) for the isolation of tuberculosis-infected people were a ubiquitous feature of cities in developed countries, with 50% dying within 5 years of admission. [[36]](#cite_note-kingston04-36) [[37]](#cite_note-37) Although Merck's agreement with Rutgers gave it exclusive rights to streptomycin, at Waksman's request the company renegotiated the agreement, returning the rights to the university in exchange for a royalty. The university then set up non-exclusive licenses with seven companies to ensure a reliable supply of the antibiotic. [[38]](#cite_note-ppaw-38) 1950-2000[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Merck_%26_Co.&action=edit\u00a7ion=5)] In the 1950s, [thiazide](/wiki/Thiazide) diuretics were developed by Merck scientists Karl H. Beyer, James M. Sprague, John E. Baer, and Frederick C. Novello [[39]](#cite_note-39) and led to the marketing of the first drug of this class, [chlorothiazide](/wiki/Chlorothiazide), under the trade name Duiril in 1958. [[40]](#cite_note-40) The research leading to the discovery of chlorothiazide, leading to \"the saving of untold thousands of lives and the alleviation of the suffering of millions of victims of hypertension\" was recognized by a special Public Health Award from the Lasker Foundation in 1975. [[41]](#cite_note-41) In 1953, Merck & Co. merged with Philadelphia-based Sharp & Dohme, Inc., becoming the largest U.S. drugmaker. Sharp and Dohme had acquired [H. K. Mulford Company](/wiki/H._K._Mulford_Company) in 1929, adding portfolio. [[42]](#cite_note-42) [[43]](#cite_note-43) [[44]](#cite_note-44) [[45]](#cite_note-45) [[46]](#cite_note-46) [[25]](#cite_note-keyfacts-25) The combined company kept the trade name Merck in the United States and Canada, and as Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) outside North America. [[35]](#cite_note-Fight-35) In 1965, Merck & Co. acquired [Charles Frosst](/wiki/Charles_Frosst) Ltd. of [Montreal](/wiki/Montreal) (founded 1899), creating Merck-Frosst Canada, Inc., as its Canadian subsidiary and pharmaceutical research facility. Merck & Co. closed this facility in July 2010 but remerged in 2011 as Merck Canada. [[47]](#cite_note-47) [[48]](#cite_note-48) [Maurice Hilleman](/wiki/Maurice_Hilleman), a scientist at Merck, developed the [mumps vaccine](/wiki/Mumps_vaccine) in 1967, [[49]](#cite_note-49) the first [rubella incidence of rubella-associated birth defects fell from up to 10,000 per year in the U.S. to zero in the aftermath of the rubella vaccine's development. [[52]](#cite_note-52) Hilleman also developed the first and the first [varicella vaccine](/wiki/Varicella_vaccine), for chickenpox. [[53]](#cite_note-53) The company was incorporated in New Jersey in 1970. [John J. Horan](/wiki/John_J._Horan) became CEO and Chairman in 1976, serving until 1985. [[54]](#cite_note-:1-54) Under his leadership, the company's investment in R&D grew threefold, and Merck became the largest pharmaceutical company in the world. [[54]](#cite_note-:1-54) [[55]](#cite_note-55) In 1979, Merck scientists developed [lovastatin](/wiki/Lovastatin) (Mevacor), the first drug of the [statin](/wiki/Statin) class. [[56]](#cite_note-56) scientist [William C. Campbell](/wiki/William_C._Campbell_(scientist)) and [Satoshi mura](/wiki/Satoshi_%C5%8Cmura) developed [ivermectin](/wiki/Ivermectin) for [veterinary](/wiki/Veterinary) use in 1981, and later put it to human use against [Onchocerciasis](/wiki/Onchocerciasis) in 1987-88 with the name Mectizan; [[57]](#cite_note-omura11-57) today is against [joint venture](/wiki/Joint_venture), KBI Inc., with [AstraZeneca](/wiki/AstraZeneca). [[61]](#cite_note-61) During the late 1980s and 1990s, the company also established joint ventures with [DuPont](/wiki/DuPont) to access research and development expertise, and with [Johnson & Johnson](/wiki/Johnson_%26_Johnson) to sell over-the-counter consumer medications.[ [citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] In 1985, Merck received approval for [imipenem](/wiki/Imipenem), the first member of the [carbapenem](/wiki/Carbapenem) class of antibiotics. Antibiotics of the carbapenem class play an important role in treatment guidelines for certain hospital-acquired and multi-drug resistant infections. [[62]](#cite_note-62) [P. Roy Vagelos](/wiki/P._Roy_Vagelos) became CEO and Chairman that year, succeeding Horan. [[63]](#cite_note-63) In 1991, Merck's Kelco subsidiary was responsible for [volatile organic compound](/wiki/Volatile_organic_compound) (VOC) emission pollution in the San Diego area. In 1996 Merck paid $1.8 million for polluting the air. New machines were installed to reduce smog emissions by 680,000 lb (310,000 kg) a year. [[64]](#cite_note-epaa-64) In November 1993, Merck & Co. acquired Medco Containment Services for $6 billion. [[65]](#cite_note-65) [[66]](#cite_note-66) Merck & Co. spun Medco off ten years later. [[67]](#cite_note-67) 2001-2019[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Merck_%26_Co.&action=edit\u00a7ion=6)] In May 2002, The [Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation](/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation) purchased stock in Merck. [[68]](#cite_note-68) From 2002 through 2005, the Australian affiliate of Merck paid publishing house [Elsevier](/wiki/Elsevier) an undisclosed amount to produce eight issues of a medical journal, the [Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine](/wiki/Australasian_Journal_of_Bone_and_Joint_Medicine). Although it gave the appearance of being an independent peer-reviewed journal, without any indication that Merck had paid for it, the journal actually reprinted articles that originally appeared in other publications and that were favorable to Merck. The misleading publication came to light in 2009 during a personal injury lawsuit filed over Vioxx; 9 of 29 articles in the journal's second issue referred positively to Vioxx. [[69]](#cite_note-nytns-69) [[70]](#cite_note-fakery-70) The CEO of Elsevier's Health Sciences Division, Michael Hansen, admitted that the practice was \"unacceptable\". [[71]](#cite_note-hansen-71) In 2005, [CEO](/wiki/Chief_executive_officer) [Raymond Gilmartin](/wiki/Raymond_Gilmartin) retired following Merck's voluntary worldwide withdrawal of [Vioxx](/wiki/Vioxx). Former president of manufacturing [Richard Clark](/wiki/Richard_Clark_(pharmacologist)) was named CEO and company president. [[72]](#cite_note-72) In November 2009, Merck & Co. completed a merger with [Schering-Plough](/wiki/Schering-Plough) in a US$41 billion deal. [[73]](#cite_note-73) [[74]](#cite_note-74) Although Merck & Co. was in reality acquiring Schering-Plough, the purchase was declared a \"reverse merger\", in which \"Old\" Merck & Co. was renamed Merck Sharp & Dohme, and Schering-Plough renamed as \"Merck & Co., Inc. [[75]](#cite_note-75) The maneuver was an attempt avoid a \"change-of-control\" in order to preserve Schering-Plough's rights to market [Remicade](/wiki/Remicade). A settlement with [Johnson & Johnson](/wiki/Johnson_%26_Johnson) was reached in 2011, in which Merck agreed to pay $500 million. [[15]](#cite_note-RemicadeJNJ-15) [[76]](#cite_note-76) Merck Sharp & Dohme remains a subsidiary of the Merck & Co. parent. [[1]](#cite_note-10K-1) [Richard Clark](/wiki/Richard_Clark_(pharmacologist)) retired as CEO and company president in October 2011 and [Kenneth Frazier](/wiki/Kenneth_Frazier) became CEO.

[[85]](#cite_note-Fierce2015-85) During that time, the company sold its consumer health business to [Bayer](/wiki/Bayer) and narrowed the company's focus to immunology, vaccines, diabetes, emerging markets and medicines used in hospitals, like certain antibiotics. [[85]](#cite_note-Fierce2015-85) In January 2015, Merck acquired [Cubist Pharmaceuticals](/wiki/Cubist_Pharmaceuticals).

[[140]](#cite_note-140) [[141]](#cite_note-141) On December 7, 2012, the foundation announced that it was ending its donations to the [Boy Scouts of America](/wiki/Boy_Scouts_of_America) citing its discrimination against gay people. [[142]](#cite_note-142) Patient assistance programs[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Merck_%26_Co.&action=edit\u00a7ion=11)] Merck & Co. was one of the first American pharmaceutical companies to offer assistance to those unable to afford its medications, beginning a program in the 1950s. [[143]](#cite_note-143) Merck & Co. offers seven patient assistance programs, each with specific eligibility requirements.

[[146]](#cite_note-146) Merck for Mothers[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Merck_%26_Co.&action=edit\u00a7ion=13)] Merck for Mothers is Merck's global initiative to help create a world where no woman has to die while giving life. [[147]](#cite_note-147)[ [non-primary source needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary,_secondary_and_tertiary_sources)] Mectizan donation program[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Merck_%26_Co.&action=edit\u00a7ion=14)] In 1987, Merck began a program with [UNICEF](/wiki/UNICEF) to donate its new drug [Mectizan](/wiki/Mectizan) to \"all that need it for as long as needed\" [[148]](#cite_note-unicef1-148) in an effort to combat [onchocerciasis](/wiki/Onchocerciasis), also known as river blindness, primarily in Africa. Up to that point, the [World Health Organization](/wiki/World_Health_Organization) had fought the disease through the use of [insecticides](/wiki/Insecticides) to lower the population of its primary vector, the [Black Fly](/wiki/Black_Fly). [[149]](#cite_note-stanford1-149) However, when studies in the 1980s showed how effective the drug was at treating and preventing the disease, the WHO agreed to use it instead of its previous strategies. [[57]](#cite_note-omura11-57) Merck's involvement is considered a key factor in the success against the disease all over the world, [[150]](#cite_note-unorg1-150) and the decision to donate the entirety of the drug to all those in need of it is used as part of the Mectizan Donation Program that covers countries such as Yemen and African countries. [[151]](#cite_note-mectizan-151) More than 700 million people have been treated since the inception of the program with 80 million people still undergoing treatment in Africa, Latin America, and Yemen. Blindness caused by onchocerciasis is decreasing, and there are regions of Latin America and Africa that have been shown to have eliminated the disease altogether. [[151]](#cite_note-mectizan-151) Lawsuits and controversies[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Merck_%26_Co.&action=edit\u00a7ion=15)] Vioxx[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Merck_%26_Co.&action=edit\u00a7ion=16)] In 1999, the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration](/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration_(United_States)) (FDA) approved Vioxx (known generically as [rofecoxib](/wiki/Rofecoxib)), a Merck product for treating [arthritis](/wiki/Arthritis). Vioxx was designed as a selective inhibitor of the enzyme [cyclooxygenase-2](/wiki/Cyclooxygenase-2). Such compounds were expected to cause less gastrointestinal bleeding than older [anti-inflammatory](/wiki/Anti-inflammatory) drugs such as [naproxen](/wiki/Naproxen), which were associated with 20,000 hospitalizations and 2000 deaths each year. [[152]](#cite_note-152)[ [non-primary source needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary,_secondary_and_tertiary_sources)] Vioxx became one of the most prescribed drugs in history. [[153]](#cite_note-153) Thereafter, studies by Merck and by others found an increased risk of heart attack associated with [Vioxx](/wiki/Vioxx) use when compared with naproxen. Merck adjusted the labeling of Vioxx to reflect possible cardiovascular risks in 2002. [[154]](#cite_note-154) On September 23, 2004, Merck received information about results from a [clinical trial](/wiki/Clinical_trial) it was conducting that included findings of increased risk of heart attacks among Vioxx users who had been using the medication for over eighteen months. [[155]](#cite_note-155) On September 28, 2004, Merck notified the FDA that it was voluntarily withdrawing Vioxx from the market, and it publicly announced the withdrawal on September 30. An analysis for the period 1999-2004, based on U.S. Medical Expenditure Survey data, reported that Vioxx was associated with 46,783 heart attacks, and along with the other popular [COX-2 inhibitor](/wiki/COX-2_inhibitor) [Celebrex](/wiki/Celebrex), an estimated 26,603 deaths from both. [[156]](#cite_note-156)[ [non-primary source needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary,_secondary_and_tertiary_sources)] About 50,000 people sued Merck, claiming they or their family members had suffered medical problems such as heart attacks or strokes after taking Vioxx. [[157]](#cite_note-Reject-157) In November 2007, Merck agreed to pay $4.85 billion to settle most of the pending Vioxx lawsuits. [[158]](#cite_note-Agrees-158) The settlement required that claimants provide medical and pharmacy records confirming the occurrence of a heart attack, ischemic stroke, or sudden cardiac death; the receipt of at least 30 Vioxx pills within 60 days prior to the injury or death; and confirmation of Vioxx being used within 14 days of the Vioxx-related event. [[159]](#cite_note-159) The settlement was generally viewed by industry analysts and investors as a victory for Merck, considering that original estimates of Merck's liability reached between $10 billion and $25 billion. [[158]](#cite_note-Agrees-158) As of mid-2008, when the plaintiff class had reached the threshold percentage required by Merck to go through with the settlement, plaintiffs had prevailed in only three of the twenty cases that had reached juries, all with relatively small awards. [[157]](#cite_note-Reject-157) Merck has refused to consider compensation for Vioxx victims and their families outside the US. This is particularly true in the UK where there are at least 400 victims and the legal protection afforded to the victims and their families is particularly weak. [[160]](#cite_note-160) According to internal e-mail traffic released at a later lawsuit, Merck had a list of doctors critical of Vioxx to be \"neutralized\" or \"discredited\". \"We may need to seek them out and destroy them where they live,\" wrote an employee. A Stanford Medical School professor said that Merck was engaged in intimidation of researchers and infringement upon [academic freedom](/wiki/Academic_freedom). [[161]](#cite_note-161) On May 20, 2008, Merck settled for $58 million with 30 states alleging that Merck engaged in deceptive marketing tactics to promote [Vioxx](/wiki/Vioxx). [[162]](#cite_note-162) All its new television pain-advertisements must be vetted by the Food and Drug Administration and changed or delayed upon request until 2018. [[163]](#cite_note-163) Fosamax[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Merck_%26_Co.&action=edit\u00a7ion=17)] Fosamax ( [alendronate](/wiki/Alendronate)) is a [bisphosphonate](/wiki/Bisphosphonate) used for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis and for the prevention of skeletal problems in certain cancers. The American College of Clinical Endocrinology, the [American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists](/wiki/American_College_of_Obstetricians_and_Gynecologists), the [North American Menopause Society](/wiki/North_American_Menopause_Society) and the UK National Osteoporosis Guideline Group recommend alendronate and certain other bisphosphonates as first line treatments for post-menopausal osteopotosis. [[164]](#cite_note-164) [[165]](#cite_note-165) [[166]](#cite_note-166) Long-term treatment with bisphosponates produces anti-fracture and bone mineral density effects that persist for 3-5 years after an initial 3-5 years of treatment. [[167]](#cite_note-167) Alendronate reduces the risk of hip, vertebral, and wrist fractures by 35-39%. [[168]](#cite_note-168) [[169]](#cite_note-169) In December 2013, Merck agreed to pay a total of $27.7 million to 1,200 plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit alleging that the company's osteoporosis drug had caused them to develop osteonecrosis of the jaw. Prior to the settlement, Merck had prevailed in 3 of 5 so-called bellwether trials. Approximately 4000 cases still await adjudication or settlement as of August 2014. [[170]](#cite_note-170) Medicaid overbilling[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Merck_%26_Co.&action=edit\u00a7ion=18)] A fraud investigation by the [United States Department of Justice](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice) began in 2000 when allegations were brought in two separate lawsuits filed by whistleblowers under the [False Claims Act](/wiki/False_Claims_Act). [[171]](#cite_note-wapo-171) They alleged that Merck failed to pay proper rebates to [Medicaid](/wiki/Medicaid) and other health care programs and paid illegal remuneration to health care providers. [[172]](#cite_note-172) On February 7, 2008, Merck agreed to pay more than $650 million to settle charges that it routinely overbilled Medicaid for its most popular medicines. The settlement was one of the [largest pharmaceutical settlements](/wiki/List_of_Largest_Pharmaceutical_Settlements) in history. The federal government received more than $360 million, plus 49 states and Washington, DC, received over $290 million. One whistleblower received a $68 million reward. Merck made the settlement without an admission of liability or wrongdoing. [[171]](#cite_note-wapo-171) [[173]](#cite_note-173) [[174]](#cite_note-174) \"Merck\" name legal dispute[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Merck_%26_Co.&action=edit\u00a7ion=19)] In 191 of 193 countries, the original Merck company, the [Merck Group](/wiki/Merck_Group) of Darmstadt, owns the rights to the \"Merck\" name. In the United States and Canada, the company trades under the name EMD (an abbreviation of Emanuel Merck, Darmstadt), its legal name here says Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and instead of \"Merck Group\", the \"EMD Group\" name is used. In the United States and Canada, Merck & Co. holds the rights to the trademark \"Merck\", while in the rest of the world the company trades under the name MSD (an abbreviation of Merck, Sharp & Dohme) and its legal name says here Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc. Kenilworth, NJ, USA. In 2015 the [Merck Group](/wiki/Merck_Group) adopted a new logo and said it will be \"much more aggressive\" about protecting the brand of \"the real Merck\". [[175]](#cite_note-175) Merck of Darmstadt has initiated litigation against its former subsidiary, Merck & Co. (MSD) of Kenilworth, in several countries over infringing use of the Merck name. In 2016, the [High Court of Justice](/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice) in the [United Kingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom) ruled that MSD had breached an agreement with its former parent company and that only Merck of Darmstadt is entitled to use the Merck name in the United Kingdom. [[35]](#cite_note-Fight-35) The judge also held that MSD's use of \"Merck\" as part of branding on its global websites were directed to the UK and infringed Merck's trade mark rights in the UK. [[176]](#cite_note-176) In response to the ruling, MSD initiated counter-litigation in the United States in January 2016 by filing a federal lawsuit which accused its former parent company of \"infringing on its trademark\" through actions that included the increased usage of \"Merck KGaA\" and \"MERCK\" in branding in the US as well as on its social media presence. Further Merck & Co. has also accused the Merck Group of federal trademark dilution, unfair competition, false advertising, deceptive trade practices, breach of contract, and [cybersquatting](/wiki/Cybersquatting). The case came to a head when a research scientist believed he was communicating with Merck & Co regarding a research grant in oncology, when in fact he was talking with the Merck Group. As a result, Merck & Co. asked the federal court to stop the Merck Group from using \"Merck\" on any products or marketing materials in the United States. As a direct result, Merck & Co is seeking \"all monetary gains, profits, and advantages\" made by the Merck Group and three-times the damage, plus additional punitive damages. [[32]](#cite_note-Wrangle-32) In April 2020, in the course of litigation of Merck against MSD in Switzerland, the [Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland](/wiki/Federal_Supreme_Court_of_Switzerland) ruled that MSD's use of the \"Merck\" brand in its global websites could, absent [geotargeting](/wiki/Geotargeting) mechanisms, have \"commercial effect\" in Switzerland and could therefore violate Merck's rights (if any) to the \"Merck\" brand in Switzerland. [[177]](#cite_note-177) Tax fraud[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Merck_%26_Co.&action=edit\u00a7ion=20)] In 2007, Merck paid $2.3 billion to settle allegations of offshore tax fraud between 1993 and 2001. [[178]](#cite_note-178) Propecia[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Merck_%26_Co.&action=edit\u00a7ion=21)] In 2021, an investigation by [Reuters](/wiki/Reuters) revealed that Merck's baldness drug [Propecia](/wiki/Finasteride) caused persistent sexual dysfunction in men. [[179]](#cite_note-:0-179) The drug has been linked to over 700 incidences of suicidal thoughts [[180]](#cite_note-180) and 110 deaths. [[179]](#cite_note-:0-179) Merck has been receiving reports since 1998, but never included the risks on the label. [[179]](#cite_note-:0-179) In 2015, Merck was sued by consumer-rights law firm Hagens Berman over a wrongful death linked to Propecia. [[181]](#cite_note-181) Environmental violations[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Merck_%26_Co.&action=edit\u00a7ion=22)] Merck & Co. once used [methylene chloride](/wiki/Methylene_chloride), an animal carcinogen on the [United States Environmental Protection Agency](/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency)'s list of pollutants, as a solvent in some of its manufacturing processes. Merck chemists and engineers subsequently replaced the compound with others having fewer negative environmental effects. Merck has also modified its equipment to protect the environment, installing a distributed control system that coordinates chemical reactions more efficiently and expedites manufacturing by 50 percent, eliminating the need for the disposal and storage of harmful waste. Biological oxygen demand has also been reduced. In 2011, Merck paid a $1.5 million civil penalty to settle alleged violations of federal environmental laws at its pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in [Riverside, a Conference Supporter for the Virtual [ISPOR](/wiki/ISPOR) Asia Pacific conference in September 2020.
