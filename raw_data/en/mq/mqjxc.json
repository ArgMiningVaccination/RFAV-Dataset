Mindfulness and Meditation Mindfulness is a heightened state of awareness of your surroundings and yourself.

Yoga Research shows that yoga can help reduce your urges to drink more alcohol. This way, it can also help you make it through the withdrawal process. In addition, yoga can reinforce the positive effects of meditation. 3. Healthy Eating People affected by alcoholism often have poor diets. A lack of needed nutrients can potentially make your withdrawal symptoms more intense. A well-balanced, healthy diet will help you restore missing nutrients.

You can ease your dehydration by drinking plenty of water. 5. Vitamin and Mineral Supplements Alcoholism can deplete your body's supply of several vitamins and minerals. Examples include: - B vitamins - Vitamin A - Vitamin C - Calcium - Iron - Vitamin E - Zinc In addition to asking you to eat healthier, your doctor may recommend taking supplements to replace these vital substances. 6.

Research shows that properly performed acupuncture can help you control your alcohol withdrawal symptoms. 7. Tai Chi Tai chi is a slow-paced, therapeutic martial art widely practiced in some Asian countries. Its use in America has increased in the last several decades.

Herbal Remedies Certain herbs may help curb some of the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. These herbs include: - Milk thistle - Kudzu - St. John's wort Always talk to your doctor before taking an herbal supplement. 9.
