Nodules are small, liquid-filled bumps that can grow throughout your body. They can grow anywhere, but they're most common in your throat, thyroid, lungs, and adrenal glands. This might sound alarming, but don't worry! Nodules are very common and almost all cases are benign. In most cases, your doctor probably won't even try to treat them. However, natural home remedies have mixed success in shrinking nodules. If you do notice any growths on your body, then see your doctor for an exam. They can confirm whether or not you need treatment and recommend the best course of action for your health. Steps Treating Nodules at Home Since over 90% of nodule cases are benign, your doctor probably won't take any particular steps to treat yours. There are a few home-care tips you can take after speaking to your doctor. Only take these steps after you've already seen your doctor and confirmed that the nodules are benign. Keep in mind, however, that home remedies have mixed success in getting rid of nodules. If you'd like to shrink or remove them, then speak to your doctor for further advice. - 1Observe the nodule to make sure it doesn't grow. The \"watchful waiting\" procedure is the most common approach for benign nodules, no matter where they are. Your doctor will observe the nodule for a 6-18-month period to see if it grows or changes. If not, then the doctor will probably leave the nodule alone with no further treatment. [[1]](#_note-1)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)FamilyDoctor.org Family-focused medical advice site run by the American Academy of Family Doctors [Go to source](#) - Stay in contact with your doctor during the watching period. If you notice the nodule growing or changing in shape, schedule an exam. - 2Try an herbal mixture to shrink benign thyroid nodules. While home remedies don't have much effect on nodules, one natural treatment might help for thyroid nodules. Try a mixture of 400 mg of spirulina, 50 mg of curcumin, and 50 mg of Boswellia twice a day. This treatment showed some success in shrinking thyroid nodules after 3 months. [[2]](#_note-2)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health [Go to source](#) Advertisement - Ask your doctor before trying any herbal treatments like this to make sure it's safe for you. - 3Avoid using Chinese herbal medicine as a treatment for nodules. While some websites claim that mixtures from Chinese herbal medicine are an effective nodule treatment, studies don't prove this. There is no information confirming that these treatments work on nodules, so skip them unless your doctor recommends them. [[3]](#_note-3)X Research source - 4Don't try to treat nodules with dietary changes. Some websites claim that eating more fruit, yogurt, and dietary supplements while cutting out fatty foods will shrink nodules. These are mostly good dietary tips, but they won't shrink your nodules, so don't rely on this as a treatment. - Following a good diet high in fruits and vegetables does lower your risk of cancer, particularly thyroid cancer. However, this still won't shrink your nodules.

However, this still won't shrink your nodules. Medical Treatments for Nodules While you might want to try home remedies and avoid seeing the doctor, nodules aren't the kind of thing you can treat yourself. If you notice any lumps or growths throughout your body, then it's very important to see your doctor as soon as possible. During the exam, your doctor will confirm whether or not the growth is a nodule and recommend the best treatment for you. - 1Have a biopsy to confirm that the nodule is benign. While it's very rare, there's a small chance that a growth on your body could be cancerous. Whenever your doctor examines a nodule, they will probably want to do a biopsy to confirm that the growth isn't cancerous. During a biopsy, the doctor will take a small sample from the nodule and test it for cancer cells. In most cases, this comes back negative and confirms that the nodule is benign. [[5]](#_note-5)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)American Cancer Society Nonprofit devoted to promoting cancer research, education, and support [Go to source](#) - The biopsy procedure might be different depending on where the nodule is. For a thyroid nodule, the doctor may insert a small needle into your neck.

Over 90% of nodules are benign and non-cancerous, so the biopsy is just a precaution.

For a thyroid nodule, the doctor may insert a small needle into your neck. - 2Take hormone medications if the nodule is on your thyroid. Both an over- and under-active thyroid could cause nodules on that gland. If you have either condition, then your doctor may want to try regulating your thyroid with hormone medications. This might shrink the nodules and correct any other complications. [[9]](#_note-9)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals [Go to source](#) - If you have an underactive thyroid, the doctor will probably prescribe synthetic thyroid hormones to boost your thyroid function. - If you have an overactive thyroid, the doctor may prescribe an anti-thyroid medication like Tapazole to reduce thyroid function. - All of these medications are powerful, so take them exactly as your doctor directs you to. - 3Correct adrenal nodules with hormone medications. Nodules on your adrenal glands could interfere with your body's hormone levels. If your doctor discovers that your adrenal hormones are off balance, then they'll probably prescribe some hormone medication to regulate your adrenal function.

Nodules in your lung, as long as they aren't cancerous, usually don't cause any problems. You probably won't even notice they're there, and doctors usually discover them during routine CT scans. It's best to leave these nodules alone and simply observe them to see if they grow. [[11]](#_note-11)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals [Go to source](#) - If nodules cause any breathing trouble, then your doctor will probably suggest a surgical removal. - 5Shrink cancerous nodules with alcohol injections. This treatment, called alcohol ablation, is a potential treatment for small cancerous nodules. The doctor will inject a small amount of alcohol into the nodule to kill any cancer cells. This might help you avoid surgery for smaller nodules. [[12]](#_note-12)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals [Go to source](#) - Alcohol ablation requires several treatment sessions, so make sure you stick with the recommended schedule for the best results. - 6Remove large or cancerous nodule with surgery. If the nodule is causing problems or is cancerous, then the doctor will probably want it surgically removed. This is often a simple, minimally-invasive surgery, depending on where the nodule is. By removing the nodule, you should avoid any risk of it spreading. [[13]](#_note-13)X Research source - After the surgery, you may need further cancer treatment. - If you have a nodule on your thyroid removed, they surgeon may also take out part of the thyroid. In this case, you might have to take thyroid medication afterward. Soothing Throat Nodules Nodules commonly form in your throat, and this can be very uncomfortable. See a doctor to make sure the nodules are benign. Then, there are plenty of things you can do from home to soothe the pain and potentially even prevent more nodules from forming. - 1Drink plenty of water. While drinking water is always important, it's especially important if you have throat nodules. This can keep your throat moist and prevent damage. It can also soothe your vocal cords if you've been talking a lot. [[14]](#_note-14)X Research source - 2Limit your alcohol and caffeine intake. Both of these can irritate your throat and make nodules worse. Drink caffeine and alcohol in moderation so you don't aggravate your symptoms.

Smoking irritates your throat and can cause nodules If you smoke, it's best to quit as soon as possible. If you don't, then don't start in the first place. [[16]](#_note-16)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals [Go to source](#) - Secondhand smoke can also cause throat problems.

You might not expect it, but some health issues can put you at a higher risk for developing nodules in your throat. Talk to your doctor and follow the treatment regimen that they prescribe for you. [[17]](#_note-17)X Research source - Common conditions that could cause nodules include allergies, acid reflux, sinus infections, and hyperthyroidism. - Some of these conditions might have natural treatments, and some might require medication. For example, if you have acid reflux, then avoiding trigger foods could help, but antacids might be a better treatment. Always follow your doctor's suggestions for the best treatment. Medical Takeaways While most nodules are benign and don't require treatment, there aren't any known home treatments that can shrink them. You still need to see a doctor to confirm that they aren't cancerous. After seeing your doctor, then take the recommended steps to observe and manage nodules and make sure they don't get any worse. The vast majority of people don't need further treatment for nodules unless they're causing problems. Expert Q&A [Add New Question] - QuestionDo you need to have surgery for this?No-- not all nodules need to be surgically removed. Many go away on their own as long as they are not further irritated (eg. nodules on the vocal cord) and many can be reduced in size using the methods listed. - QuestionCan screaming cause more permanent damage?Yes, especially if you don't rest your throat enough. Try to speak at a normal level and avoid screaming as much as possible. - QuestionYou mentioned checking out to see if the nodes are cancerous. The only way we have been told that this can be checked is to operate and then do an analysis. What other option apart from an operation do you know of?Having a biopsy done is the only definitive way to determine if a nodule is cancerous. You can use various imaging techniques like X-rays, ultrasound (US) or MRIs and this can give your doctor more information about the nodule and can lead them to suspect it is cancerous, but a sample of the nodule has to be examined before a diagnosis can be made.
