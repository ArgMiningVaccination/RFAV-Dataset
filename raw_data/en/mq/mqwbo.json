The flu, sinus infections, bronchitis, strep and a whole host of other nasty bugs are running rampant. So what can you do to help boost your immunity? Drink lots of fluids...mostly water Staying hydrated this time of year is vital. With the cold weather and all the bugs your body is fighting, it is easy to get dehydrated. Try to stick with water as much as you can and drink more than you are used to. Sugary and caffeinated drinks can actually dehydrate you so steer clear of these. Vitamin D3 Vitamin D has been shown to boost the immune system as well as have a whole host of other important functions in your body. We tend to lack Vitamin D in the colder months due to the fact that we are covered up and not out in the sun. Vitamin D is naturally made by your body when absorbed through the skin and then altered through the liver and kidneys to become active. When supplementing Vitamin D make sure you are using D3 which is the active form needed by your body. Eat well What you put in is what you get out. Bulking up on fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins will help bolster your immune system. Stay away from sugars and processed foods as well as alcohol as these all tax your immune system and make it harder to fight infection. Sleep Sleeping is when your body heals best. Try to get between 7-8 hours of restful sleep a night. Make it a point to go to bed earlier and have fewer distractions when trying to fall asleep. Chiropractic adjustments When your spine is out of alignment it can put unwanted pressure on the surrounding muscles, discs, joints, and other structures. This, in turn, can lead to nerve interference. When there is a problem with your nerves then it can affect everything else. This includes your immune system. Your nerves control everything you do. The things you think about and maybe more importantly those that you don't have to think about are all controlled by your nervous system. So when your spine is in proper alignment your body can then function at a higher capacity.
