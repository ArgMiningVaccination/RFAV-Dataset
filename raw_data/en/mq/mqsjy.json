Scientists worked marvels to create the coronavirus vaccines helping protect the world, but they don't have an easy cure for what's causing Europe's fourth pandemic wave \u2014 government distrust. Researchers and doctors overwhelmingly cite wariness towards government as a reason for vaccine refusal. While some of the hesitation is linked to the vaccines themselves and the speed at which they were developed and approved, in Central and Eastern Europe \u2014 the heart of the current case surge \u2014 the crisis of confidence is much broader. In this region, deep suspicion of the institutions promoting vaccines has created an army of the [unvaccinated](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-next-coronavirus-wave/) \u2014 despite ample availability of doses. That, in turn, is driving a [ devastating wave](https://www.politico.eu/article/who-europe-region-epicenter-of-coronavirus-pandemic/) of infection and death that has surpassed all previous peaks in Bulgaria and Romania, the EU countries with the lowest rates of vaccination at 23 and 34 percent respectively. As the pandemic has shown countless times \u2014 high cases in just a few countries are bad news for the bloc as a whole. You may like \"We have a diminishing trust in authorities,\" said Cosmin Toth, a sociology lecturer at the University of Bucharest. Publicity campaigns led by politicians urging people to get vaccinated have failed due to \"hatred against the political system,\" Toth told POLITICO. Incentives such as cash prizes or free hotdogs have yet to produce big results, while initiatives aimed at enlisting church leaders and local doctors as vaccine lobbyists have struggled to get off the ground. The most recent [Eurobarometer](https://europa.eu/eurobarometer/surveys/detail/2532) survey confirms that trust in national governments across Central and Eastern Europe is significantly below the average for the EU. That reflects the shallow roots of democracy in many of the bloc's newer member states, which cast off communist rule a little over three decades ago. Political upheaval has compounded the fraught relationship between populations and their governments. Bulgaria has been run by a caretaker government since May and is facing its third general election of the year on November 14. Romania's government collapsed in early October and no successor has yet been formed. Slovenia is also gearing up for an election in 2022. With politicians preoccupied and keen not to further alienate voters, coronavirus cases are surging and hospitals are struggling to cope. \"Nine out of 10 patients in our intensive care unit die,\" said Ivan Poromanski, head of the Pirogov Hospital, one of the biggest medical facilities in the Bulgarian capital Sofia, which treats patients with severe COVID-19. The number of deaths among the vaccinated is \"minuscule,\" Poromanski added in a television interview. Far from the mainstream Europe is one of the most vaccine-hesitant regions in the world \u2014 but resistance to the coronavirus shot is greater than with previous vaccines, said Heidi Larson, director of the Vaccine Confidence Project at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. This is understandable, she said, given how new the vaccines are. Still, experts who have followed previous vaccination campaigns in Central and Eastern Europe often express surprise at just how difficult it has been to convince people to take a COVID-19 jab. \"The whole situation surprises me every day. I couldn't have imagined what has happened,\" said Mitja Vrdelja, head of the communications department at the Slovenian National Institute of Public Health. \"We were trying to implement all the knowledge that we had gained over [the past] 10 years \u2014 nothing was successful.\" While Estonia has done better than Bulgaria and Romania, its vaccination coverage of 57 percent is nowhere near frontrunners such as Spain, Portugal or Denmark. Andero Uusberg, a member of the Estonian government's COVID-19 scientific advisory council and a psychologist, said that a recurrent feature among the unvaccinated is \"their subjective distance from society's mainstream.\" In Estonia, this could be cultural, with a lower vaccination rate among minority Russian speakers, who make up about 24 percent of the population. These factors have resulted in countries reaching a vaccination ceiling of sorts. According to POLITICO's [vaccination tracker](https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-vaccination-live-data-tracker/), the flow of people coming forward to be jabbed has almost petered out. And despite the fact that Central and Eastern Europe are the hardest-hit regions, there is little sign of a spike in uptake sufficient to achieve broad protection. This reinforces the need for new approaches, said Larson, to bridge the \"last mile\" of vaccination. \"It does really remind us that we need different strategies for different stages \u2014 not just different localities, but different stages of vaccine rollout,\" she said. One strategy is to target the few institutions and individuals that are still trusted. Larson said there needs to be \"very local identification of who are the local, trusted partners and or individuals within certain communities.\" This could be the local barber, farmer, doctor or priest. \"I wouldn't at all accept that we're going to land here, just because [vaccination] slowed down,\" she said. In Romania, however, the government's attempts to turn to the church had [little effect](https://www.politico.eu/article/romania-coronavirus-vaccines-fourth-wave-orthodox-church/), with some high-ranking church figures openly promoting vaccine conspiracy theories. \"The Romanian people are among the most religious in Europe, and yet the leaders of the Romanian Orthodox Church have not sent out any firm pro-vaccination messages,\" said Emilian Damian Popovici, associate professor of epidemiology at Victor Babe University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Timioara. Using GPs to deliver vaccinations is another method where experts see potential. In many areas in Bulgaria, local GPs are \"everything for the patient,\" said Hristiana Batselova, assistant professor of epidemiology of infectious diseases at the Medical University of Plovdiv. If a doctor told them to avoid getting vaccinated, she said, it would be \"absolutely impossible,\" to convince them otherwise. That's why Batselova is so concerned about what she perceives as a lack of education for doctors about new jabs. As with priests in Romania, the failure to get doctors on board in Bulgaria has been a significant blow to the vaccination campaign. Last resort If gentle persuasion doesn't work, the remaining option is to compel people to get a shot. Estonia recently implemented what is effectively a vaccine mandate, requiring proof of vaccination or recovery from COVID-19 to access many events. In Romania, proof of vaccination, a negative test or previous infection is needed in many indoor settings. A recent attempt to introduce this in certain workplaces, however, was blocked in parliament. Slovenia has also made vaccines mandatory for government workers, and in October launched a green pass for access to indoor spaces such as restaurants and shopping malls. Not everyone agrees with the changes, saying they can further damage the minimal trust hesitant people have in institutions. It also doesn't always work: Estonian rules, for example, have done little to increase vaccination uptake, with figures showing only a small spike in first vaccinations. Mandates are potentially useful in certain settings such as in health care, said Andrej Kirbi, an associate professor at the department of sociology at the University of Maribor in Slovenia. But forcing society at large to get jabbed after failing to persuade people to come forward voluntarily is a risky path to take. \"When vaccine mandates are implemented among the public with low vaccination rates as some kind of solution to often unsuccessful or failed government policies in dealing with COVID-19 pandemic, then [they] might backfire, generating even perhaps a greater crisis of legitimacy or social turmoil,\" said Kirbi.
