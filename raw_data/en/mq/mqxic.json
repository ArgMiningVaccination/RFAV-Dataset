The root and underground stem (rhizome) of this plant are used in the traditional medicine practices of Eastern and Northern Europe and parts of Asia. This plant is known by many other names, including arctic root, golden root, orpin rose, rose root, rosewort, and Siberian golden root. Extracts of the root and rhizome of the plant are dried and dissolved in alcohol to prepare medicinal compounds. Doses vary and there is often little evidence about the best dose of supplements or whether the dose advertised in over-the-counter preparations is accurate.

Claims Advocates believe that rhodiola is an adaptogen. This herbal medicine term means that this substance is thought to help the body respond to stress and restore normal function. Rhodiola is used to Treat the symptoms of altitude illness Improve learning and memory Increase energy Improve exercise performance Reduce high cholesterol levels Reduce symptoms of depression Reduce fatigue Slow down the aging process Evidence There are no high-quality studies in people demonstrating that rhodiola is effective for treating any health condition. Small studies suggest that rhodiola improves exercise and sport performance ( [1, 2](/professional/special-subjects/dietary-supplements/rhodiola#v75592183) [ References The botanical name of rhodiola is Rhodiola rosea.

A small study in 89 people taking rhodiola for 42 days showed benefit in treatment of mild to moderate depression ( [3](/professional/special-subjects/dietary-supplements/rhodiola#v75592183) [ References The botanical name of rhodiola is Rhodiola rosea.

In a 12-week, randomized, controlled trial in 57 subjects comparing rhodiola to sertraline and placebo, depression improved in both sertraline and rhodiola groups, and there was no significant difference between the two. However, rhodiola was less effective than sertraline compared to placebo but had fewer adverse effects ( [4](/professional/special-subjects/dietary-supplements/rhodiola#v75592183) [ References The botanical name of rhodiola is Rhodiola rosea.

Rhodiola has shown efficacy in combination with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI, [5](/professional/special-subjects/dietary-supplements/rhodiola#v75592183) [ References is Rhodiola rosea.

Adverse Effects Possible adverse effects of rhodiola include dizziness and either dry mouth or excessive saliva production. Drug Interactions The use of rhodiola in combination with prescription antidepressant drugs could cause tachycardia. Rhodiola could cause hypoglycemia, particularly in people who take antihyperglycemic drugs. Rhodiola could reduce blood pressure, possibly causing hypotension in people who already have low blood pressure or in those taking antihypertensive medications. Rhodiola may increase levels of warfarin. Rhodiola has anti-inflammatory effects, which, in combination with anti-inflammatory drugs, may result in additive effects causing adverse effects. Rhodiola may counteract the effects of immunosuppressants. (See also table .) References 1.
