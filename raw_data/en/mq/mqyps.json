Reviews [](https://www.massagebook.com/reviewspublic/myReviews/6062667) I come here with my friend who has back pain. This acupuncture healing center is really amazing. It's clean, nice and comfortable. The herbal aroma smells soothing and relaxing. The service is great. People are very friendly and willing to help. Doctor Long is really patient and helpful. My friend says she feels SUPER after the treatment. Acupuncture really works! They also have a herb shop next door. It sells all kinds of herbs, tea and ginseng there. A real authentic traditional Chinese herb shop. [Martyna J.](https://www.massagebook.com/reviewspublic/myReviews/6062667) My mom has fibromyalgia. Suffers from chronic pain daily despite routine doctors visits. Countless medications and even a medical procedure that burned the nerves in her spine. She's currently had 6 sessions here and her pain level is minimal, her energy level has increased and her overall mood! I recommend this place to ANYONE and EVERYONE! [Luis Torres](https://acuhealcenter.com/appointments/) (Translated by Google) My wife arrived with paralysis on her face and in 3 weeks she is 90% relieved what the doctors did not do. I recommend this place 100%. (Original) Mi esposa llego con par\u00e1lisis en la cara y en 3 (Original) Mi esposa cara y en 3 este lugar.

The actual scope of acupuncture, herbal medicine, and massage can treat many conditions including gynecological disorders like irregular menstruation, lung issues like COPD, emotional disorders like anxiety, depression, and chronic fear. Cardiovascular Disorders Digestive Disorders Pain Disorders Emotional Disorders Respiratory Disorders Insomnia Fertility Disorders Finding Root Cause We understand that each person experiences their own unique health problem.

Once they understand your problem and internal imbalances associated with your illness, they formulate a treatment plan that may include herbs, acupuncture, massage, or even chiropractic to ensure results.
