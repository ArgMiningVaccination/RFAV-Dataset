Life-giving vine of Peru. U\u00f1a de gato. These are all names used to describe the medicinal tropical vine known in western cultures as Cat's Claw. 0A member of the Rubiaceae family, Cat's Claw is a sacred plant traditionally used in Peruvian cultural medicine and more recently introduced into western herbalists' armamentarium. Not much research has been done on this herb, but what has been found is astronomical. \"Research has shown the plant contains immune stimulating alkaloids, which also enhance the parasympathetic nervous system\" (Horne, 2010). In simpler terms, it is an immune stimulating powerhouse that been proven to help eliminate free radicals that cause cellular damage. It curatively inhibits cancer growth and improves DNA repair. Some say, it works better than medicinal mushrooms! It is also used to relieve chronic pain and fantastic for curing intestinal inflammation and disorders. Because of its immunity enhancing properties, it is one of the \"most sacred [herbs] among the Ashaninkas, Campo and other Amazonian tribes. According to indigenous Shamans, u\u00f1a de gato serves as a bridge and balancer between the physical and spiritual worlds, which is helpful to health problems since they believe in spiritual causes of bad health\" (Draxe, 2016). There is a certain supernatural ability and consciousness when ingesting this herb. What is also interesting, is that Cat's Claw looses its medicinal potency when absorbed directly through the tongue. Washing a tincture down with water or any other preparation with lemon juice or apple cider vinegar is key to allowing the magic to permeate into the jungle of your soma and soul. "}
