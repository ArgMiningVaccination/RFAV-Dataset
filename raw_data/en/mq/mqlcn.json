These herbs will help you get rid of them naturally. 1) Milk thistle Milk thistle helps protect the healthy cells in the liver from free radical damage or inflammation caused by toxins. It also stimulates the regeneration of new healthy cells and aids the body in mopping up toxins. It helps to increase glutathione production, the body's major [antioxidant ](https://www.besthealthmag.ca/article/the-truth-about-antioxidants-and-your-skin/)substrate.
