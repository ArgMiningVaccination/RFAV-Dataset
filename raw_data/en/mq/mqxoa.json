The database covers a selected collection of peer-reviewed South African scholarly journals and forms an integral part of the |[SciELO Network](https://www.scielo.org/) project. SciELO SA is managed by the Academy of Science of South Africa ( [ASSAf](http://www.assaf.org.za/)), funded by the South African Department of Science and Technology ( [DSI](https://www.dst.gov.za/)) and endorsed by the South African Department of Higher Education and Training ( [DHET](https://www.dhet.gov.za/)). | | [ ]about this site SciELO SA focuses on strengthening the scholarly journal evaluation and accreditation systems in South Africa. The SciELO library is an integral part of a project being developed by [FAPESP](http://www.fapesp.br/) (the Research Support Foundation of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo), in partnership with [BIREME](https://www.paho.org/en/bireme) (the Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information). Since 2002, the Project is also supported by [CNPq](http://portal.cnpq.br/web/guest/pagina-inicial) (the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, which is part of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation in Brazil). The [SciELO Priority lines of action 2019-2023](https://wp.scielo.org/wp-content/uploads/priority-lines-action-2019-2023.pdf) as well as the [SciELO Network criteria](https://wp.scielo.org/wp-content/uploads/Criterios-Rede-SciELO-en.pdf) are being introduced into the SciELO SA collection systematically. SciELO collections contribute to the development of the national capacities in scientific editing and publishing to be on par with the international state of the art. The project aims to make visible the science of developing countries that the mainstream does not provide for this scientific communication. The coordinating centres all follow the same methodology and technology developed and maintained under the leadership of SciELO Brazil. Each collection has its own web portal with multilingual interfaces in English, Portuguese and Spanish. The interfaces include a bibliometric module that provides usage statistics based on article downloads and impact indicators based on citations. This allows for the following up of the performance of the collections and the individual journals, and contributes to the enhancement of the evaluation of scientific production. The [SciELO Portal](https://www.scielo.org/) provides a single point of access to the SciELO Network of collections with searching, dissemination and bibliometric services. The SciELO Open Access collections represent an important global public good, contributing to the advancement of national programs and priorities on scientific research and communication. South Africa joined the SciELO Program in 2009. In 2013 SciELO SA became an independent national collection within the SciELO Network. Journals are considered for inclusion in SciELO SA when they have received a favourable evaluation from ASSAf's journal quality peer-review panel and adhere to the [SciELO SA-specific criteria for acceptance](https://sites.google.com/view/assaf-scholarly-pub-resources/scielo-sa/criteria-for-acceptance). or further information or to submit a journal for consideration, contact: [scielo@assaf.org.za](mailto:scielo@assaf.org.za) . | | [ ]help The SciELO interface provides access to its serials collection via an alphabetic list of titles or a subject list or a search form by word of serial titles, publisher names, city of publication and subject. The SciELO SA alphabetical list of titles can be viewed [here](http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_alphabetic&lng=en&nrm=iso). The interface also provides access to the full text of articles via author index or subject index, or by a search form on article elements such as author names, words from title, subject, words from the full text and publication year. | | SciELO - Scientific Electronic Library Online Academy of Science of South Africa - ASSAf 25A De Havilland Crescent, Persequor Park "}
