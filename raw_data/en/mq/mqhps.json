The institute seeks to increase the value of health care and improve health outcomes through interprofessional health educa tion (IPE) , innovative research, and community engagement. Working with colleges across the UH campus, community partners, and colleagues across multiple sectors, the institute's goal is to advance the health of our community by focusing on social needs, risk factors, and determinants of health and by increasing the use of value -based care (VBC) delivery models. Specifically, the goals of the institute are to: 1. Train health care professions students, faculty, and clinician s to thrive in and shape hea lth systems using evidence -based approaches developed through the institute's research agenda . 2. Improve the health of populations and communities by engaging communities and practices . 3. Engage in research that furthers treatment models and the overall advancement of clinical sciences in primary care, nursing, pharmacy, social work, and other areas, including the delivery of high -value care and value -based payment models . MISSION STATEMENT To be a leader in health systems science by producing high -impact research to inform policy ; facilitat ing innovative IPE programs that prepare the next generation of health care clinicians to lead team -based practice; and developing novel programs that support population health and community transformation, with an emphasis on Houston's Third Ward and East End. We do this by integrating social and medical data to drive evidence -based practices, test the efficacy of new models of care in real -world settings, and contribute to the university's goal to enhance student success and increase research and scholarly productivity . UH draws strength from its diversity to transform lives and communities through education, research, service, and innovation in a real-world setting. In line with this overarching mission, t he Humana Institute fosters interprofessional , team -based care in the Colleges of Medicine, Nursing, Optometry, Pharmacy , and Social Work. Recognizing the wealth of health exp ertise within UH, t he institute has developed collaborations that extend beyond the health professions . 2 For example, in creating a VBC specialization (Coursera ), we partnered with the College of Education to develop both the educational pedagogy and refine the course content . Consisting of six courses and a capstone project, the spe cialization is designed to develop an awareness of VBC reimbursement and operating models (Table 1), providing health systems science education for a broad range of learners, including health professions faculty, students , and staff ; industry leaders ; and lay community members. For clinicians, th is first -of- its-kind specialization provides the tools necessary to support development of novel ideas and skills to elevate frontline patient care. To date, almost 2 ,000 learners have enrolled in the specialization, with more than 3 ,500 completing the Introduction to VBC module . The overall course rating is 4.8/5.0 . We have successfully obtained continuing education credits for physicians and nurses and are exploring expansion to oth er health professions during 2022. In addition, we have obtained microcredentialing for this course via Credly. Table 1. Value -Based Care Specialization Courses Course Description Introduction to VBC and the US Health Care System Provides introduction to VBC concepts. Population Health Addresses population health and related key terms to refine understanding of population health and influencers of health care costs, including social determinants of health. Managing Processes to Improve Outcomes Introduces critical office -based processes that a VBC practice must manage in the drive toward improved patient outcomes. Reimbursement Models Builds high -level knowledge of the current medical -coding and payment mechanisms of most US health care services. Examines the importance of coding to reflect chronic conditions and other diagnoses accurately and how VBC and value -based payments utilize th ese measures and data. Organizational Competencies Highlights the changes required by an organization to succeed in VBC and value -based payment. Quality Improvement in Organizations Explores ways that provider organizations can successfully move from volume to value through implementing quality improvement plans and continuous quality improvement. Capstone Project Integrates the work learners have completed in this specialization, allowing them to reflect on their learning and implement a VBC ini tiative within their organization. 3 In order to develop a strong and diverse workforce of future health professionals, it is important to expose students of diverse backgrounds and interests to new learning opportunities from various sectors of the health ecosystem. Specifically designed to increase representation of minority students in population health , the inaugural Summer Health Equity Research Program was a 6 -week, mentored, virtual research and training experience for 18 UH medical students and 21 undergraduate students from 9 historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and minority -serving institutions (MSI s) nationwide . Each week included approximately 40 hours of synchronous learning, group activities , and independent -learning tasks, equipping students with skills in health equity, population health , community engagement, and research methods. The program introduced research methods and taught students to collaboratively address complex social issues impacting health e quity, as they would in their future medical careers . Overall, th is collaboration with the College of Medicine Office of Research, Humana , and Dispensary of Hope, inspires health care professionals who are skilled in advancing population and community health and who have a passion for working with underserved communities . The research conducted by the Humana Institute , in collaboration with academic, community, and industry partners, informs its coordinating and supporting role in facilitating the establishment of new educational initiatives. 4 PROJECTED ACCOMPLISHMENTS WITHIN 5 YEARS 1.

For example, DOH , which collects and distributes millions of dollars in pharmaceuticals annually to low -income, chronically ill patients, partnered in the Summer Health Equity Research Program for medical students . As part of this partnership, DOH identified several resea rch questions to help inform its population health initiatives. Medical -student teams, guided by mentors and coaches, including Dr. Hillary Blackburn, Vice President of DOH, conducted scoping reviews of the literature to address issues such as the role of federally qualified health centers in improving medication access and factors influencing medication adherence in patients with diabetes. Students from both the medical - and undergraduate -student programs shared their findings with DOH , with industry and c ommunity partners, and with UH faculty and staff during a virtual research day, during which Ms. Lharissa Jacobs, Vice President of Health Strategies at the American Heart Association , served as the keynote speaker . As an outgrowth of this initiative, multiple student groups have presented their work at regional and national conferences , while another used its project as a catalyst to develop a mentoring program with Blackshear Elementary, located in the Third Ward. This effort also became t he genesis for a partnership between the institute and the American Heart Association to address food insecurity by developing a Student Food Council that will provide stipends to five students from varied disciplines at UH and T exas Southern University to address food security and nutrition within our community. Additionally, this work will examin e the role of access, adoption characteristics , and food retail network participation in VBC initiatives targeting food insecurity. Similarly, the institute has p artnered with local health departments, community organizations, university colleagues, and industry to address the COVID -19 pandemic through educational programs, provision of vaccin ations (COVID -19 and influenza) co-located with social services, and curriculum development. Examples of these initiatives are described in Table 2. 6 The Humana Institute has also leveraged external partnerships to create programming to advance IPE for students within and outside UH. Building on the 2019 IPE Summit hosted by the Humana Institute at UH, national IPE experts from the UT Austin School of S ocial Work, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and UT Rio Grande Valley collaborated with the Humana Institute to host a virtual IPE Summit addressing lessons learned from the pandemic. The summit connected 79 leaders in IPE from institutions acr oss Texas covering topics including building resilience, collaborating to solve wicked problems, and creating partnerships to advance health.

However, in addition to these colleges, the institute has purposely forged collaborations spanning education and research across the university to include faculty and students from UH College s of Business , Technology, Education, and Natural Science and Mathematics . Throughout all collaborations, the unifying theme has focuse d on improving the value of health care and population health outcomes by addressing social determinants of health. In 202 1, the Humana Institute supported Dr . McClain Sampson of the Graduate College of Social Work ($50,000 total funding ) to examine the impact of maternal medical homes. The inst itute also supported the launch of a Nurse Telehealth Managed Care Clinic (College of Nursing), providing $75,000 in start -up funding for needed equipment , and establishment of a medical -legal partnership between the UH College of Medicine and Lone Star Circle of Care ($ 36,688 total funding ). Dr. Sheara Jennings of the Graduate College of Social Work received $25,000 in pilot funding to support preliminary work to address the mental health needs of minority communities within Houston as part of the institute's work to address loneliness among community -dwelling se niors . Additionally, Dr. Ioannis Kakadiaris (Department of Computer Science) was awarded $ 40,412 in funding to support graduate students to develop a chatbot to support co -location of vaccination services with food distribution sites. This work was foundat ional to the submission of a partnered National Institutes of Health ( NIH) grant ( principal investigator [ PI]: Bettina Beech) with which the institute and institute partners Humana and Walgreens are collaborating . (Table 6 in Contracts and Grants describes project s in detail.) The institute has previously provided fu nding to support student stipends and subsequently in -kind data support to the Data Analytics in Students' Hands (DASH) program in collaboration with Dr. Dan Price (Honors College) and Dr. Claudia Neuhauser (Data Sciences Institute) , as well as data to exam ine the use of artificial intelligence to predict diabetes outcomes ( co-PIs: Winston Liaw, Ioannis Kakadiaris) . Finally, as part of its ongoing workforce development efforts, the institute has supported students across numerous colleges within UH and local universities to create pathways to careers in health -related fields . In 2021, more than 50 students from UH participated in projects with the institute or with our industry partner, Humana. Students engaged in health equity projects, clinical rotations, a nd other health service -related projects (see Table 3 and Appendix). Several students have subsequently successfully secured admission to medical school s and health policy internships, as well as permanent positions with Humana. 8 Table 3.

Projects have been varied, focus ing on older adults, Medicaid enrollees , individuals experiencing homelessness or substance abuse, and populations with low health literacy and socioeconomic status. As part of our work, we have partnered with community work ing groups to identify health priorities from the community's perspective, to develop the infrastructure needed to support community -based participatory research, and to initiate collaborative projects addressing local priorities , such as food insecurity, social isolation, and direct services to sup port healthy food access in the Third Ward. At the beginning of the COVID -19 outbreak, community member -initiated focus groups were established to understand its impact on families in Houston's Sunnyside, Old Spanish Trail , and Third Ward areas. A separate UH institute with activities similar to the Humana Institute is the Health Research Institute. Dr. Woodard, the Humana Institute Director, serves as the Health Research Institute Center for Addictions Research and Cancer Prevention Community Engagement Core Director, promoting synergy between the two institutes and serv ing as a catalyst for ongoing collaboration. ANTICIPATED CHANGES Size: As we continue to successfully obtain grant funding, we anticipate increasing administrative (e.g. , research assistant, project coordinator) and methodologic (e.g. , quantitative and qualitative analysts) staff. Additionally, we will continue to grow our student pathways by providing internships to undergraduate and graduate students. Budget ( Internal vs . External Support) : The institute is supported by a philanthropic gift from Humana. Currently, this funding supports a portion of institute salaries , with the remaining funding providing support to endowed chairs across the health professions colleges , as well as unrestricte d funding to the College of Medicine. We anticipate continued infrastructure support from this philanthropic gift. Consistent 9 with our current efforts, we will seek grant funding (e.g. , federal, philanthropic, and foundation support) to increase institute capacity and create additional collaborations both internal and external to UH. We expect that infrastructure funding from Humana will remain stable while external funding will maintain its upward trajectory. We will continue to use additional project -based funding from our partnership with Humana to support initiatives and projects university -wide aligned with the institute's mission. Administrative Structure and Governance : The institute has an advisory council comp osed of the associate provost and the d eans from the Colleges of Nursing, Social Work, Pharmacy, Optometry, and Medicine. This body meets quarterly, provides feedback to the institute's director and other leadership regarding the extent to which it is meeting its mission, identifies areas of co llaboration within UH, and provides strategic guidance. Additionally, the institute's Collaborative Research Steering Committee, consisting of faculty across UH and Humana, provides guidance and central coordination of all research activities involving par tnered projects (e.g., those that utilize Humana clinical/administrative data ). Mission and ( New/Updated) Goals: The mission of the institute will continue to focus on improving the value of care and population health outcomes through IPE, research, and community engagement. Aligned with these goals, the ins titute's focus has sharpened to align our strategic plan wi th ongoing health equity initiatives at the health care system, education, and community levels, as well as the strategic priorities of our partners also center ing on health equity. New/Updated Metrics : We do not anticipate significant changes to our over all metrics in the immediate future; however, as we expand our capacity, we expect an increase in the scope of our dissemination efforts through both scholarly presentations and publications and alternative metrics (e.g., social media uptake, internal/exte rnal collaborations).

Evaluating a Contact Tracing Course: How Universities Can Develop the P ublic Health Workforce. Public Health Reports ( under review) Community Outreach and Service The Humana Institute focuses on communities in the greater Houston metropolitan area. These include the Third Ward, East End, and Northwest Houston. Through community linkages, the institute infuses research with collaboration from the community, connects patients with community resources, and implements qu ality improvement principles within community practices. For example, the institute regularly collaborates with community working groups in Houston's Third Ward and East End. The purpose of the groups is to work with members of the community to identify he alth priorities from the community's perspective and to develop research and other collaborative projects that address these priorities. From these efforts, a food insecurity collaborative that includes residents and community partners is working to addres s food insecurity and nutrition in the Third Ward. Immediate results from the community working groups include research around food insecurity and direct services to support access to health y food in the Third Ward. For example, the College of Medicine an d the Humana Institute partnered with the American Heart Association, Humana, Lone 15 Star Circle of Care, and Third -Ward faith -based institutions to provide free produce and toiletries to members of the community. Additionally, to address social isolation in seniors, the UH -Humana partnership paired UH students with community -dwelling elderly who ha d screened positive for loneliness. At the beginning of the COVID -19 outbreak, community members initiated focus groups to understand the impact of COVID -19 on fam ilies in Houston's Sunnyside, Old Spanish Trail , and Third Ward areas. A member of the Humana Institute worked with the group to design a focus -group protocol and facilitate focus -group sessions . The institute also leveraged funding from the Walmart Foundation to create disaster preparedness kits that were distributed to seniors in the Third Ward. Insights from our community engagement are combined with quantitative and qualitative data to inform continuous learning and the provision of health care se rvices aligned with the needs and values of these local communities. FUTURE MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE Given the nascent stage of the Humana Institute as a university -level academic institute, we do not expect the five -year projected outcomes to shift signif icantly over the next year. Our current measures of performance are as follows : 1. Advance understanding of how social risk influences health, contributes to disparities, and impacts heath care value . 2. Develop collaborations with community partners to develop research and educational initiatives guided by community needs . 3.
