Led by our Certified Medical Herbalist, Sage LaPena (Nomtipom Wintu), Healing Ways involves patients and their families in the healing process and recognizes our unique relationship to the community and our environment. This includes offering traditional medicine in a clinical setting as part of your overall care plan. In addition, community activities are offered, including Herbalism Classes, Urban Plant Walks, Community Meals, Elder- Youth Workshops, and other forms of community collaboration that reflect the mission of the Healing Ways program. Herbalism Workshops teach participants how to identify, harvest, and use plants as natural healing remedies. Urban Plant Walks will help participants learn about local medicinal plants that grow throughout Sacramento. Community Meals are a chance for the whole family to learn about and share traditional foods. The meal will also include information about how to prepare the main dish. Elder-Youth workshops allow a safe space for youth and elders to meet, share, and discuss tradition and culture while learning about each other's lives. Interested in learning more?
