He also holds a Bachelors in Science in Engineering (Computer Science Engineering) and a BA in English and Creative Writing (Highest Honors) from the University of Michigan. Pediatrics requires creativity, ingenuity, playfulness, and a love of challenges and problem-solving. As a software engineer turned physician-midwife, and with extensive training and experience in a variety of settings, Dr. Kass is uniquely qualified to provide comprehensive naturopathic primary care. In 2014, Dr. Kass retired the midwifery portion of his practice, and in 2017 decided not to renew his midwifery license, thus dropping the LM (licensed midwife) and CPM (certified professional midwife) and significantly shortening the length of his signature! Dr. Kass currently specializes in the naturopathic primary care of babies and children, including well baby and well child checks, immunizations, oral care (including basic dental exams and topical fluoride varnish), prescribing medication, and facilitating referrals and specialty care. He further specializes in breastfeeding and infant feeding problems, including tongue tie and milk supply challenges. He also helps people induce lactation (bring in milk) even if they have not been pregnant (for example, lesbian couples who both want to breastfeed, or adoptive parents who want to breastfeed). Dr. Kass has previously been a professional member of the [Midwives Association of Washington State](http://washingtonmidwives.org/), and has served on the Board of Directors as Treasurer. He is currently a member of the [Naturopathic Association of Primary Care Physicians](https://www.ndprimarycare.org/), the [Washington Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics](https://wcaap.org/), and writes for [NDsForVaccines.com](http://ndsforvaccines.com). In 2017, Dr Kass was the first-ever ND to be recognized as a [CDC Childhood Immunization Champion for Washington State](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/events/niiw/champions/profiles-2017.html?utm_content=buffer46fbd&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer#wa).
