Certain individuals such as injection an non injection drug users, incarcerated/recently incarcerated individuals, persons experiencing homelessness, and men who have sex with men (MSM) are at the highest risk for contracting hepatitis A. In an effort to prevent the spread of hepatitis A in Virginia, the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) has launched a statewide hepatitis A vaccination campaign. Local health departments are working to reach high risk individuals and provide education and vaccine through immunization clinics. VDH is asking all providers to assess their patients' hepatitis A vaccination status and provide the vaccine to those who are not adequately immunized, regardless of risk factors.

Measles Makes a Comeback Outbreaks of measles have been reported across the country, especially in areas with populations who have low coverage rates of the MMR vaccine. The majority of measles cases are in New York City and New York state, which are primarily among unvaccinated people in Orthodox Jewish communities and associated with travelers who brought measles back from Israel. With the upcoming Passover holiday, which begins the evening of Friday April 19 and ends the evening of Saturday, April 27, we anticipate there may be more opportunities for measles to spread. Please be aware that many people celebrating Passover do not stay at home. Families may travel to resorts, hotels, or take cruises for the holiday. And there will likely be an influx of international travelers before Passover, including many from Israel where measles is circulating. Popular destinations include New York, New Jersey, Florida, Las Vegas, Arizona, and Washington, D.C. Maintaining high vaccination rates is critical to prevent the spread of measles in a community! As you interact with your patients, ask them if they are up to date on their vaccines and offer to provide any vaccines they might need. For more information, "}
