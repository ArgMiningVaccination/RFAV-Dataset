I believe it was my training in [Kundalini Tantra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kundalini) that began to change the way I experience scent. There was a whole set of practices that were meant to awaken the root energy, in other words, the Muladhara, one of the seven primary chakras according to Hindu tantrism, associated with the nose. While most other students had mystical experiences, I realised that I was doing a better job at sniffing out scents. Those days I lived in Discovery Bay, Hong Kong and used to take my pets on hikes. It started with smelling and locating snakes, then went onto sniffing out strange citrus plants and flowers that were later found to be medicinal. I started encouraging this and it was during one of my visits to India when I walked into an 'Attar and Essential Oils' shop that I realised the peculiar nature of my sensitivity. Each oil I tried seemed to talk to different physical parts of me. With my training in Chakra, eventually, I started noting down how the oils impacted each energy centre. This was the time I was processing the breakdown of my marriage and the grief was often like a rock on my chest. The first oil that I blended was for heartbreak and then on I was hooked. Understanding the Tridosha Theory My work is based on the personalisation of oil blends from the classical [Ayurveda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayurveda) theory, the science of life founded on the [Tridosha Theory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224897767_The_tridosha_theory), an ancient Indian system of medicine that is said to be 5000 years old promoting a personalised approach to health and wellbeing. In particular, my practice revolves around the medicinal flowers used in [Pushpa (Floral) Ayurveda](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279632970_A_REVIEW_ON_THERAPEUTIC_USES_OF_FLOWERS_AS_DEPICTED_IN_CLASSICAL_TEXTS_OF_AYURVEDA_AND_SIDDHA) whenever feasible. According to the Tridosha Theory, our wellbeing is the result of a balance amongst three dynamic energies found throughout the human body and mind called doshas. We are made up of the Five Elements (Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Space) and the combination of these elements give rise to three doshas. Vata is the results of air and earth, the principle necessary to mobilize the function of the nervous system. Pitta is fire combined to water and the principle which uses bile to direct digestion and hence metabolism into the venous system. Kapha is related to earth and water, the principle which relates to mucous, lubrication and the carrier of nutrients into the arterial system. How Ayurveda oils can relieve menopause symptoms Fragrance can trigger memories; a whiff of a specific freshly baked snack or newly dried laundry can catapult us to our childhoods. Fragrance can also change our moods. Pure natural essential ayurvedic oils are power-packed with hundreds of compounds that are known to impact the body in many ways - from hormones to neurotransmitters to digestion and they can also relieve menopause symptoms. This stage of life, in particular, is considered to be a transition from the fiery Pitta to the cold Vata. Depending on your body type, the symptoms of menopause would differ; while the fiery Pitta type would have more pronounced hot flashes and irritability (when in excess within the body one can feel anger, frustration, and impatience), the cold dry Vata one might have mood swings, anxiety, insomnia and dryness. On the other hand, the Kapha body type would have symptoms such as weight gain, fluid retention, depression etc. Oils that help during menopause include cinnamon, cardamom, fennel, ginger, turmeric, sandalwood, rose, geranium, jasmine sambac and jasmine grandiflora, peppermint, coriander, jatamansi, ashwagandha and holy basil. Tea tree and lavender are a mainstay in menopause-related aromatherapy, as they have estrogen boosting compounds. Always check for allergies before using oils, as many are sensitive to the naturally occurring compounds in the oils. Less is more, a gentle fragrance wafting from a diffuser or a few drops near your pillow is all you need to soothe you down. Ayurveda scents for balance Traditional aroma blends are particularly useful for restoring overall balance amongst the doshas. Try making these oils at home with all-natural ingredients and make sure to add slow deep breathing and meditation while enjoying the scents.
