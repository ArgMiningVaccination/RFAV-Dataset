If you've never experienced an adjustment from our chiropractor in Fort Wayne, you probably have some lingering questions about chiropractic care and its many applications. Here are some frequently asked questions and their answers. Chiropractic care is a method of relieving or controlling musculoskeletal issues through the manipulation of the spinal and extremity joints. This form of care dates back to 1895. Since then, the modality has evolved and developed into a number of techniques, some using manual adjustments and others making use of instrument-guided adjustments. (Our chiropractor in Fort Wayne utilizes both approaches as needed.) [Chiropractic manipulation](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/308917#what-is-chiropractic-manipulation) operates the core notion of addressing a problem called a subluxation. A subluxation is a subtle, partial dislocation of the structures that make up a joint. Our chiropractor in Fort Wayne imparts small, precise, efficient degrees of force to shift the joint components into a more normal configuration. Chiropractic care holds several advantages over other treatment methods. As an all-natural means of correcting [joint problems](/joint-pain-treatment-fort-wayne/), it allows for drug-free pain management and symptom relief. The fact that chiropractic care is also non-surgical in nature means that our chiropractor in Fort Wayne can provide treatment with no hospitalization, lengthy recovery time, or risk of infection. Our chiropractor in Fort Wayne combines detailed diagnostics with multiple healing techniques to help you enjoy the most effective relief possible. Diversified Technique remains the classic form of chiropractic adjustment. This manual technique can address a wide range of problems, from mild subluxation issues to severe accident injuries. Activator Technique represents the modern world of instrument-assisted chiropractic care, and our chiropractor in fort Wayne uses this technique as needed. A device called an Activator delivers extremely gentle, small, quick adjustments, making it ideal for the delicate areas of the body and/or extremely sensitive patients. When the spinal vertebrae, discs, and nerves suffer from compression-related problems, chiropractic spinal decompression techniques can treat them without surgery. Two techniques employed by our chiropractor in Fort Wayne include flexion-distraction and the Gonstead Technique. Flexion-distraction makes use of a motorized table that gently stretches the spinal column, allowing discs to return to their normal positions and relieving pressure on nerves. The Gonstead Technique uses a number of different diagnostic tools and techniques to isolate inflammation points along the spine. It includes methods for adjusting a joint in all directions, not just from side to side. Chiropractic care enjoys a solid reputation for safety. Multiple research studies have found this form of treatment both safe and beneficial for all ages, from children to seniors. While no medical treatment is ever completely risk-free in nature, researchers found that the benefits outweighed any risks. Our chiropractor in Fort Wayne studied for many years, becoming a Certified Chiropractic Sports Physician, and has taught at the International Academy of Advanced Chiropractic Orthopedics. Chiropractic adjustments can improve your range of pain-free joint motion, making it a useful treatment for arthritis and other chronic degenerative conditions.

If you need a Fort Wayne back pain doctor, you can rely on chiropractic care to relieve back pain, sciatica, and other issues caused by herniated discs and spinal alignment errors. Our chiropractor in Fort Wayne can even use this modality to help you remain well.
