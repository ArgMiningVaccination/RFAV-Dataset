Here are 7 Ayurvedic medicines that you may simply carry with you while travelling to ward off motion sickness. 1) Ginger Chews/Candies Ayurveda has traditionally valued ginger for its anti-nausea qualities. Ginger chews or candies are not only easy to carry, but also helpful for reducing motion sickness-related nausea and vomiting. Ginger's warm, pungent spice promotes digestion and calms an upset stomach. 2) Cardamom Seeds Cardamom, a flavorful spice used frequently in Ayurvedic recipes, aids with digestion and eases motion sickness. It is helpful to carry a little supply of cardamom seeds to chew on while travelling. 3) Peppermint Essential Oil The stimulating scent of peppermint can work wonders to settle an unsettled stomach. You can take peppermint essential oil in a little vial with you when you travel.

These mixtures, which frequently include ginger, fennel, and other herbs that promote digestion, might be a useful addition to your travel kit.
