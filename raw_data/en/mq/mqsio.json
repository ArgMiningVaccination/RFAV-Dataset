It is important to use the best quality, organically grown herbs, which have been produced according to Good Manufacturing Procedures. The result is a dependable, effective herbal product. Poor outcomes from herbal treatment are most often due to the use of poor quality herbs. WHEN ARE HERBS USED? Herbs are used in a wide variety of conditions, including detoxification, liver support, regulation of the immune system, organ support [e.g. thyroid gland], regulating metabolic functions [e.g. blood sugar balance], emotional support, and virus and fungus elimination.
