Everyday events and our reactions to them sometimes affect our sense of well-being and peace of mind. It's common to get the blues or become sad when you're disappointed. Most people feel sad about losses like divorce or separation, the death of a friend or loved one, or a layoff from a job. These feelings are an expected reaction to a stressful or traumatic event. These feelings will likely get better over time. Several things make you more likely to have feelings of depression, such as: - Being female. Women are twice as likely as men to have feelings of depression. Hormonal changes may play a role. These feelings may be seen more during pregnancy. They're most common shortly after the birth of a baby ( [postpartum depression](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.tn9218#tn9218-sec)), or shortly before or during [menopause](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.stm159386#stm159386-sec). Some women have feelings of sadness or depression shortly before their menstrual periods ( [premenstrual syndrome, or PMS](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.stp1749#stp1749-sec)). - Age older than 60. Feelings of depression in this age group are often overlooked. That's because the symptoms are similar to other diseases and problems that older adults may have. Adults in this age group are more likely to have social isolation. Feelings of sadness may be linked to other life events, such as retirement, the death of a spouse or child, or declining physical abilities. - Personal or family history. You are more likely to have feelings of depression if you have a history of previous depression, an [anxiety disorder](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.sta123298#sta123298-sec), or another mental health condition. You are more likely to have feelings of depression if one or both of your parents were diagnosed with depression. - Medical problems\u2014such as cancer, kidney disease, heart disease, or [Parkinson's disease](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.stp1229#stp1229-sec)\u2014or [substance use disorder](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.sts17238#sts17238-sec)or withdrawal. - Stressful life events. These are things like changing jobs, the loss of a job, or your children leaving home. - Lack of family or social support. Symptoms of depression that may point to a need for treatment vary from person to person. If you have feelings of sadness or loss of interest in pleasurable activities plus four or more of the following symptoms for 2 weeks or longer, you may be depressed. - Changes in appetite or weight - Restlessness or decreased activity that is noticed by others - Feeling tired or having low energy - Having trouble sleeping, or sleeping more than usual - Not being able to concentrate or make decisions - Feeling hopeless - Feeling worthless or guilty - Preoccupation with death or recurrent thoughts of suicide People who feel depressed may also have physical symptoms, such as body aches or stomach problems. Because \"mood swings\" and other emotional changes are thought to be a normal part of growing up, depression in children and teens often goes unrecognized. Children and teens can have depression. It can affect a child's quality of life. If prolonged or severe depression is left untreated, it can lead to serious outcomes, including [suicide](/health-wellness/health-encyclopedia/he.tv7194#tv7194-sec) attempts and even completed suicide.
