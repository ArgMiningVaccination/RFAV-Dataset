SPH This Year replaces our previous publication, SPHere, and joins our family of communication vehicles that now includes SPH T oday, SPH This Week, and SPH This Month, all with the objective of keeping faculty, staff, students, alumni, and friends\u2014our community\u2014 apprised of happenings at the School, our collective achieve- ments, and the ideas that our faculty are pushing forward. Boston University School of Public Health aims to lead the effort to improve the health of the public, now and into the future, by generating ideas, teaching those ideas to the next generation, and translating them for those who can make change happen on a global scale. SPH This Year hopes to illustrate that effort. We highlight our science and scholarship linked explicitly to the challenges in public health. This is consistent with our aspiration to produce top-tier scholarship of consequence while deepening our commitment to engagement with real-world education and practice. As I conclude my first year at the School, I am ever more enthusiastic about the work we are doing together. We celebrate our 40th anniversary as a school in 2016, and we shall be duly marking this through a series of events and the launch of new programs that endeavor to further deepen our commitment to, and take concrete steps toward realizing, our mission.

The MPH project coincided with a nationwide effort to redesign the MPH by the Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health, which established an MPH Expert Panel that consulted extensively with public health leaders and employers. School of Public Health (SPH) Associate Dean for Education Lisa Sullivan served as a member of the panel; former Dean Robert Meenan served as its chair. \"The Expert Panel focused on [ensuring] that schools and programs of public health produced graduates to fill the growing needs of the field, \" Sullivan says. \"The timing of the work was key . . . as the national effort was under way, we were fine-tuning our own recommendations for change. \" At SPH, Sullivan headed an MPH T ask Force that sought input from multiple stakeholder groups and adhered to a rigorous plan-development process. After two years, it emerged with a redesigned 48-credit MPH degree program with three essential elements: (1) an integrated core curriculum; (2) interdisciplinary graduate certificates; and (3) professional development and practical experience.ADAPTED TO CHANGES IN THE FIELD AND ATTUNED TO THE FUTURE, A NEW MASTER OF PUBLIC HEALTH CURRICULUM WILL BE IN PLACE BY 2016. \"With our new design, we will ensure that every MPH graduate has the professional skills and confidence to make a difference in public health. \" A REDESIGNED 48-CREDIT MPH DEGREE PROGRAM WITH 3 ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND PRACTICAL EXPERIENCEAN INTEGRATED CORE CURRICULUM INTERDISCIPLINARY GRADUATE CERTIFICATESGone is the longstanding concept of areas of concentration tightly aligned with academic department structure. After students take four foundational core courses, the MPH requires 16 credits in at least one of nine functional areas of study (Community Assessment, Program Design, Implementation & Evaluation; Design & Conduct of Public Health Research; Environmental Hazard Assessment; Epidemiology & Biostatistics; Health Policy & Law; Health Communication & Promotion; Health Care Management; Monitoring & Evaluation; and Program Management). While exploring these functional areas, students can also customize their knowledge via 12 credits taken in specific contextual areas of study (Chronic & Non-Communicable Diseases; Global Health; Infectious Disease; Maternal & Child Health; Mental Health & Substance Use; Pharmaceuticals; Sex, Sexuality & Gender; and Social Justice, Human Rights & Health Equity). The functional and contextual areas still reflect SPH's more popular concentrations, Sullivan says, yet also address some of the emerging key facets of public health. The overarching characteristic of the MPH, she says, is its emphasis on current and future relevance for students seeking jobs within the evolving world of public health. The plan's structure retains and enhances the applied public health focus of the practicum and culminating experience, both key features of the current MPH program. \"We have some unique areas of expertise at SPH, and we will continue to offer training in those areas to students who seek us out above all other schools and programs, \" Sullivan says. \"With our new design, we will ensure that every MPH graduate has the professional skills and confidence to make a difference in public health. \"1 2 3Mastering theBOSTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH | SPH THIS YEAR | 7 research AS THEY HELP OTHERS, ELDERLY CAREGIVERS MAY REAP HEALTH BENEFITS THAT COULD PROLONG THEIR OWN LIVES, SUGGESTS A NEW STUDY LED BY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCHERS.Among Elderly Women, Caregiving Lowers Mortality The relationship between caregiving and mortality after accounting for time-varying caregiver status and addressing the Healthy Caregiver Hypothesis. J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci. 2015 Apr 15. In a study published in The Journals of Gerontology, researchers tracked the status of 1,068 women with a mean age of 81 years. Thirty-five percent of the women were actively taking care of a spouse, family member, or friend. Lead author Lisa Fredman, SPH professor of epidemiology, says the study evaluated the association between caregiving and mortality, including treating caregiving as a time-varying event and looking at mortality for up to five years after care- giving ceased. The potential health benefits from a sustained caregiving relationship have been dubbed the Healthy Caregiver Hypothesis; it proposes that the greater physical activity inherent in performing caregiving tasks appears to be beneficial to the health of older caregivers.Overall, the caregivers in the study had lower mortality rates than non-caregivers in all analyses. These associ-ations were sensitive to the time-lag period, Fredman writes, with a more pro- nounced reduction in mortal- ity in current caregivers. This benefit diminished over time, indicating that the timing of leaving caregiving does influence this relationship and should be considered in future investigations. Fredman says previous studies have shown incon- sistent associations between caregiving and mortality, possibly because those stud- ies have primarily analyzed caregiver status at a baseline only. Better health may be related to caregivers taking on their responsibilities and continuing in that role for some time, she writes.research MOST HOMELESS VETERANS HAVE MOBILE PHONES and regularly go on the internet, making mobile technology an effec- tive tool for engaging them in health care and improving adherence to treatment, according to a study coauthored by a School of Public Health researcher. About 90 percent of the homeless veterans inter - viewed said they had a mobile phone and were open to receiving phone calls or text messages related to their health care. The study, published in PeerJ, was led by D. Keith McInnes, SPH research assistant professor of health law, policy & man- agement and a researcher with the Edith Nourse Rogers VA Hospital in Bedford, Massachusetts. The research team interviewed 30 veterans age 33-65 years in Boston housing programs, such as emergency shelters and transitional housing. Commonly mentioned health problems included depres- sion, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance and alcohol use disorders, anxiety, and hepatitis C. The authors say that despite the many barriers affecting homeless veterans' access to health care, \"our results suggest that IT such as mobile phones can contribute to improving access to outpatient health care services, which in turn may lead to improved health outcomes. \"While these technologies may not directly address these serious underlying challenges, \" they add, \"[technology] does make it easier to connect with health care providers, remember appointment times . . . and know when it is time to refill a medication. \" The authors note that additional research is needed to evaluate implementation of mobile phone communi- cation systems for homeless people and to assess their impact on health care use.Mobile Phones: Connecting Homeless Vets to Health Care Providers Preliminary needs assessment of mobile technology use for healthcare among homeless veterans.

Following rumors that scientists in China used CRISPR to try to modify the genetics of nonviable human embryos, two US scientific groups called for a morato- rium on this use. Why? Primarily because there is both public and scientific consensus that it is unsafe and unwise to attempt to make a \"better baby\" by altering the genetics of a human embryo. This is unethical human experimen- tation on the resulting\u2014and nonconsenting\u2014child. It is also an unethical and unconsented experiment from a societal point of view, because it changes the nature of what it is to be human and what we mean by human evolution. The CRISPR debate involves a call for a mora- torium on a particular kind of dangerous research, and it asks us to draw a line between using a new technology to make medicine and attempt to cure human disease, and using it to try to make a \"better\" human baby. At least some scientists see the Chinese activity as an indication that the latter is inevitable and unstoppable. T o the extent they are right, it means a scientific moratorium is not enough. If we want to avoid turning babies into manufactured products, we need to outlaw the use of genetic-editing technology on human embryos. The agenda to control human evolution cannot be left to a subgroup of scientists. T o confront the challenges of CRISPR, as well as climate change and species-endangering experiments, we will need to develop what Vaclav Havel suggested, a \"species con- sciousness\" that enables us to transcend concerns simply for ourselves, our families, and even our country.Scientists Should Not Edit Genomes of Human Embryos This is an edited and abbreviated version of a commentary posted on April 30 by George Annas, William Fairfield Warren Distinguished Professor of Health Law, Ethics & Human Rights at SPH.IT IS ALSO AN UNETHICAL AND UNCONSENTED EXPERIMENT FROM A SOCIETAL POINT OF VIEW, BECAUSE IT CHANGES THE NATURE OF WHAT IT IS TO BE HUMAN AND WHAT WE MEAN BY HUMAN EVOLUTION. research CHILDREN WITH ASTHMA are twice as likely to suffer from pneumococcal disease (PD), which can result in pneumonia, and children with asthma and another underlying comorbidity are even more likely to develop PD, according to a study led by Kimberly Shea, School of Public Health assistant professor of epidemiology. The research team used data from Danish medical registries that included 2,253 cases of childhood PD among more than 888,000 children born between 1994 and 2007 , before the introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. They assessed the impact of having asthma as well as the biologic interaction between asthma and other underly - ing health conditions on the development of PD. Children with an asthma diagnosis had increased rates of PD compared with those who never had an asthma diagnosis; the rate of cases per 100,000 child-years was highest among children aged 6 to 24 months (91.2 cases), followed by children under 6 months (78.8 cases) and children 2 to 5 years (21.5 cases). The study also found the rate of PD was especially high among asthmatic children with other comor - bidities such as cardiac disease, renal disease, or type 1 diabetes. Among chil-dren aged 2 to 5 years, the unadjusted incidence rate of PD was 7 .5 times the rate in children with asthma alone; among children aged 5 years and older, those who had both asthma and comorbid- ity were 14 times more likely to develop PD. \"The evidence presented here [supports] the addition of asthma to the list of pneumococcal vaccine- eligible conditions for older children, \" the researchers say in the journal Clinical Epidemiology, urging that children with both asthma and another underlying comorbidity be carefully assessed when presenting with bacterial illnesses.Among Children, Asthma Linked to PD Risk Population-based study of the association between asthma and pneumococcal disease in children.

Published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, the first study examines the five principal reasons youth reported for drinking different brands, to determine if those reasons were associated with problem drinking behaviors. The findings show that underage youths who cite either alcohol marketing or the influence of adults, movies, or other media as the main reasons for choosing a specific brand of alcohol are more likely to drink more and report adverse consequences than youths who report other reasons for selecting a specific brand. The findings add to a growing body of research suggesting youths' exposure to alcohol advertising affects their drinking behavior and support a widespread call to the alcohol industry (which is primarily self-regulated in the US) to strengthen its standards. The second study is believed to be the first to document an association between the consumption of different kinds of premixed, ready-to-drink flavored alcoholic beverages\u2014also known as alcopops\u2014and risky drinking behaviors Legislators, policymakers, colleges, and the alcohol industry can all do more to address a major public health problem in the US: alcohol use by underage youth. School of Public Health researchers came to this conclusion\u2014and provide powerful analysis for like-minded advocates\u2014after taking a look at contributing factors as well as prevention strategies. THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT UNDERAGE YOUTHS WHO CITE EITHER ALCOHOL MARKETING OR THE INFLUENCE OF ADULTS, MOVIES, OR OTHER MEDIA AS THE MAIN REASONS FOR CHOOSING A SPECIFIC BRAND OF ALCOHOL ARE MORE LIKELY TO DRINK MORE AND REPORT ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES . continued on p. 12 featureBOSTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH | SPH THIS YEAR | 13 related to alcohol consumption. The study, published in the American Journal of Public Health, shows heavy episodic drinking was reported by nearly 70 percent of alcopop users, by about 75 percent of \"supersized\" alcopop users, and by almost 80 percent of those who consumed more than one type of alcopop\u2014compared with 45 percent of non-flavored alcohol users. SPH researchers also looked at factors that might reduce underage drinking. A first-of-its-kind study by an SPH and Boston Medical Center team reveals that US states with stronger alcohol policies have lower rates of youth overall drinking and binge drinking. The study's results, published online in Pediatrics, further suggest that the link is largely a result of policies intended mostly for adults. Each 10 percentage point increase in the strength of a state's policy environment was related to an 8 percent reduction in the likelihood of youth drinking any alcohol, and a 7 percent reduction in the likelihood of drinking past the point of intoxication. \"Parents and adults must be a key target of strategies to reduce and prevent underage drinking, \" the authors conclude. And what strategies can help colleges? A report authored by SPH Professor David Rosenbloom to summarize a daylong workshop with 17 experts in college-age drinking says social media messaging, screening, and interventions, when used as part of a comprehensive approach, offer colleges new tools to help prevent and reduce excessive drinking. The report says programs using this approach that have been shown to be effective in small trials should be further tested because \"emerging technologies offer an almost unprecedented opportunity to build and implement effective prevention and treatment interventions at scale. \" Selection of branded alcoholic beverages by underage drinkers.

Hum Reprod. March 18, 2015. In Early Pregnancy, Caffeine May Pose Miscarriage Risk \"THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT CAFFEINE CONSUMPTION IN EARLY PREGNANCY MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH A SMALL INCREASE IN RISK OF MISCARRIAGE.\" CAFFEINE CONSUMPTION before pregnancy does not appear to affect the risk of miscarriage, but consump- tion during early pregnancy is associated with a small increased risk, according to a study led by School of Public Health researchers. Published in the journal Human Reproduction, the study is the largest to date of prospectively measured, preconception caffeine consumption and risk of miscarriage. Caffeine has been hypothesized as a risk factor for miscarriage since the 1980s, but previ- ous studies have produced conflicting results. In the new study, SPH researchers examined caffeine consumption among more than 5,000 women planning pregnancy who were enrolled in a Danish study between 2007 and 2010. Women reported their daily caffeinated beverage consumption on question- naires before conception and during early pregnancy.There were 732 women (14.3 percent) identified as having miscarriages. In the preconception period, caf - feine consumption was not materially associated with miscarriage risk, the study found. But in early preg - nancy, the risk associated with consuming 100-199 mg/day, 200-299 mg/day, and more than 300 mg/day was elevated, compared with consumption of less than 100 mg/day. Kristen Hahn, a research fellow in epidemiology and lead author of the study, says, \"The results indicate that caffeine consumption in early pregnancy may be associated with a small increase in risk of miscar - riage. Although our study is larger and improves on prior studies of this topic, our find- ings are still subject to various interpretations because there was no evidence of a dose- response effect with increasing consumption of caffeine in early pregnancy. \"MELISSA OSTROWBOSTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH | SPH THIS YEAR | 15 research COULD A FOCUS on Ebola provide opportunity for other lethal pathogens? That's a risk, according to a study coauthored by a School of Public Health researcher positing that clinicians looking for Ebola among sick travelers coming from West African countries might miss more common deadly illnesses, especially malaria. The study by David Hamer, SPH professor of global health, and colleagues in the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network cautions that eval- uating travelers for malaria and other life-threatening conditions should not be delayed while looking for Ebola. Patients with Ebola virus typically present with fever, fatigue, myalgia, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms\u2014nonspecific symptoms shared by many other frequently encountered infectious diseases. \"The differential diagnosis of illness in travelers arriving from countries with wide- spread Ebola virus trans- mission must include not only [Ebola] but also malaria and other more common infections, \" says the study, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

They found malaria was the most frequent diagno- sis among nonimmigrant travelers, affecting 40 percent of patients; among immigrants, latent tuber - culosis was one of the most frequently diagnosed illnesses. The researchers suggest that clinicians should use these data to develop a differential diagnosis and care plan for febrile travelers arriving from the region, as prompt exclusion of malaria and other life-threatening conditions is critical to limit - ing morbidity and mortality.T oo Narrow a Focus on Ebola May Miss Other Ailments \"THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF ILLNESS IN TRAVELERS ARRIVING FROM COUNTRIES WITH WIDESPREAD EBOLA VIRUS TRANSMISSION MUST INCLUDE NOT ONLY [EBOLA] BUT ALSO MALARIA AND OTHER MORE COMMON INFECTIONS.\" Differential diagnosis of illness in travelers arriving from Sierra Leone, Liberia, or Guinea: A cross-sectional study from the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network.

A new form of chronic kidney disease has claimed the lives of at least 20,000 people in Central America\u2014most of them young, male agricul- tural workers\u2014in the last two decades: etiology unknown. A study led by School of Public Health researchers, who have been working since 2009 to uncover the causes of the epidemic, shows sugarcane workers experienced a decline in kidney function during the harvest, with field-workers at greatest risk, suggesting that heat stress or other occupational factors may play a role.The study, published online in the International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health, is a step toward identifying factors contributing to the unexplained epidemic. The research team recruited 284 Nicaraguan sugarcane workers perform- ing seven different tasks and measured markers of kidney function both before and toward the end of the six- month harvest season. They found that decline in kidney function during the harvest season varied by job category, with the greatest decline among men whose jobs require strenuous labor in a hot and humid environment. The results provide evi- dence that one or more risk factors for the disease are occupational, the authors say, and are \"consistent with the hypothesis that heat stress and dehydration may play a role. \" The study did not find support for a widely held belief that extensive use of agrichemicals has caused the epidemic. The research team is plan- ning a new study to quantify exposure to both heat and agrichemicals among manual laborers in Central America, including sugarcane workers, to determine whether those exposures are associated with kidney injury.Kidney Disease Epidemic among Sugarcane Workers: Study Finds Occupational Link Changes in kidney function among Nicaraguan sugarcane workers.

An extraordinary prevalence of firearm-related violence in the US stands in harsh contrast with our peer nations. There have been 142 school shootings in the US since the December 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. In 2003, the US had the highest rate of firearm homicide (6.9 times higher) and firearm suicide (5.8 times higher) among 23 populous high-income nations. It seems worthwhile to ask: what is the role of public health in an issue that has clear public health consequences? Extant studies on the risks of firearm availability on firearm mortality have provided clear evidence of an increased risk of both homicide and suicide. A recent meta-analysis of 16 observational studies, a preventable tragedyGUN VIOLENCE: IT IS UP TO ACADEMIC PUBLIC HEALTH TO ORGANIZE AND ADVOCATE FOR MORE ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE, LESS ACCESS TO FIREARMS. The following is an edited, abbreviated version of Sandro Galea's Dean's Note of February 1, 2015.conducted mostly in the US, estimated that firearm accessibility was associated with an odds ratio of 3.24 for suicide and 2.0 for homicide, with women at particularly high risk of homicide victimization (odds ratio 2.84) compared to men (odds ratio 1.32). A 2013 study led by School of Public Health researcher Michael Siegel that covered 30 years (1981-2010) found that US states with higher esti- mated rates of gun ownership experienced a higher number of firearms-related homicides. In the case of firearm suicide, adolescents appear to be at particularly high risk, relative to adults. Another recent study examined the association between firearm legislation (using a \"legislative strength\" score based on five criteria) and US firearm deaths by state between 2007 and 2010. Higher legislative strength scores were associated with lower firearm mortality for both homicide and suicide. These studies are roundly supportive of causal relationships between firearm availability and fire- arm mortality, and conversely, of firearm legislation as protective against firearm deaths. Despite the clear evidence that guns pose a threat to health, the public health community has been unable to get traction as an effective voice on this issue. Unfortunately, instead of quality schol-arship and policy efforts to map and respond to the risks of guns, we have seen the silencing of gun researchers, health practitioners, and policymakers intent on addressing these problems. The typical mechanisms that support scholarship\u2014extramural funding chief among them\u2014have been actively discouraging of this work. It seems to me that it falls to academic public health to organize itself in a way that will allow us to be a clear and compelling voice against the legal widespread availability of a pathogen\u2014firearms\u2014that other nations have long conquered. An activist academic public health community needs to play a central role in engaging policymakers and legislators by offering clear and compelling data-driven research, translating scholarship, and fully engaging in the public conversation on this issue. It is only then that we have any hope of turning the tide on what is truly a preventable epidemic.

As president-elect, Dupuis will be part of a team heading a collaborative international community of leaders in genetics, epidemiology, sta-tistics, biology, and related biomedical disciplines, all with a keen interest in and intense enthusiasm for solv - ing complex scientific prob-lems in genetic epidemiology and statistical genetics. Her term as president- elect began on January 1, and she will serve in that position for a year before stepping into the role of president for a one-year term in 2016. Following that, she will serve a year as past-president. In 2013, Dupuis was named a fellow of the American Statistical Association (ASA), the nation's preeminent professional statistical society. In November 2014, she was named a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), honored for her \"distinguished contribu- tions to the field of statistical genetics, \" which have led to the \"discovery and improved understanding of the genetic basis for common human diseases. \" In addition to her work at SPH, Dupuis serves as faculty on BU's interdisciplinary graduate program in bioinfor - matics. The program, one of the first of its kind in the US, offers unique interdisciplinary training in the science, engi- neering, medicine, and ethics of 21st-century cell biology.

US states with more restric- tive alcohol policies and laws have lower rates of self-reported drunk driving, according to a new study led by researchers at the School of Public Health and School of Medicine, who say that a 10 percent increase in the strength of the alcohol policy environments in all states \"would result in about 404,903 fewer impaired drivers monthly. \" Researchers assigned each state an \"alcohol policy score\" based on an aggregate of 29 alcohol policies, such as alcohol taxation and the use of sobriety checkpoints. According to the study, to be published in the International Journal of Alcohol and Drug Research , each percent - age point increase in the score was associated with a percent decrease in the likeli- hood of impaired driving.A surprising finding was that laws intended to prevent binge drinking\u2014such as safe- serving laws\u2014were equally as protective against drunk driving as laws specifically targeting impaired driving, such as sobriety checkpoints. \"Basically, our study supports two parallel mechanisms involved in addressing drunk driving, \" drinking policies and driving policies, says Ziming Xuan, lead author of the study and SPH assistant professor of community health sciences.Timothy Naimi, the study's senior author and SPH asso-ciate professor of medicine and public health and a physician at Boston Medical Center, says that while states have done a lot to prevent drunk driving, \"we haven't done enough to prevent peo- ple from getting drunk in the first place.

No cause for concern . . . or is it? Vigilance is wise, study authors urge. According to a study by School of Public Health and School of Medicine researchers, more than half of patients who report \"weekend-only\" drug use end up expanding their drug use to weekdays, too\u2014 suggesting that primary care clinicians should monitor patients who acknowledge recreational drug use. The study, published in Annals of Family Medicine and led by Judith Bernstein, SPH professor of com- munity health sciences, recommends that clinicians use \"caution in accepting recreational drug use as reassuring, \" and that they conduct \"continued episodic monitoring\" of patients who report weekend-only drug use. The study analyzed data on 483 patients at Boston Medical Center who reported using drugs in the previous month and who completed a follow-up visit six months later. Of the 52 patients who reported weekend-only use initially, only 19.2 percent retained that pattern, while 54 percent were using drugs on other days of the week. The authors note that weekend-only users had lower odds of increasing drug-use frequency and severity than people whose drug use was not limited to weekends. They also say because study participants were inner-city residents with recent drug use, the findings might not be generalizable to the population as a whole. Bernstein says the findings indicate that weekend-only drug use \"frequently pro- gresses into daily use, and warrants continued mon- itoring\" by clinicians. \"The real message of this paper is a monitoring message, \" she says. Primary care providers \"are in a position to sup- port positive behavioral change, as well as to address increases in drug-use intensity as an integral part of their role. \"research Recreational Weekend Drug Use Bears Watching DRUG USE AT FOLLOW-UP VISIT RETAINED PATTERN ABSTAINEDADDITIONAL USE19.2% 26.9%53.9%19+27+54 Recreational drug use among primary care patients: implications of a positive self-report.

Rothman notes that a 2015 study by University of Michi - gan researchers showed that youths treated for assault- related injuries in an urban emergency department had higher rates of repeated vio- lent injury within two years, as compared with youths who were treated for non- assault-related injuries. The probability of reinjury was higher for females, as well as for youths with drug-use disorders and post- traumatic stress disorder. Based on the study data, Rothman concludes that \"long-term violence manage- ment action plans\" should be developed for victims, and that merely treating acute- care wounds is inadequate to prevent future violence- related morbidity and mortality. \"Violence is costly and a chronic condition, but yet the standard of care for violence victimization is not compa- rable with those for other chronic medical conditions, \" Rothman says. \"For exam- ple, no management plan is provided to patients or their families when patients are discharged, and care other than treatment of the acute care wounds is not offered consistently or covered by insurance plans. \"Comprehensive mental health, substance use, and other advocacy services should be offered, \" she writes. \"For female victims of youth violence, partner and/or sexual violence-related advocacy should be offered as a matter of course. \"New Approach Needed for Violence Victimization \"VIOLENCE IS COSTLY AND A CHRONIC CONDITION, BUT YET THE STANDARD OF CARE FOR VIOLENCE VICTIMIZATION IS NOT COMPARABLE WITH THOSE FOR OTHER CHRONIC MEDICAL CONDITIONS.\" Violent reinjury and mortality highlights the need for a comprehensive care approach to youth presenting for assault-related injury. Evidence-Based Medicine. March 2015.E+/GETTY IMAGES BOSTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH | SPH THIS YEAR | 23 feature Rising to the challenge. And in the RANKINGS.The School of Public Health now ranks among the top-10 public health schools in the country, according to the latest U.S. News & World Report graduate school rankings. The rankings, published in March, place SPH at #10 among all schools of public health. This represents the School's third consecutive rise up the U.S. News rankings, which assess the quality of schools accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health. All the health rankings are based on the results of peer assessment surveys sent to deans, other administrators, and/or faculty at accredited public health degree programs or schools. The full list is available on the U.S. News website. Dean Sandro Galea, who joined SPH in January from Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, says he and the SPH community were honored by the consideration as a top-10 school. \"I think this reflects the extraordinary work of our faculty, students, and staff over the School's history, \" Dean Galea says. \"It also represents a recognition of our commitment to be both a global leader in public health scholarship and to train the next generation of the public health workforce with a 'real world' approach to empowering communities, locally and globally. \" SPH is home to some of the most prominent public health scholars and best public health students in the world. The School community includes 357 faculty, 250 staff, and 1,000+ students from more than 40 countries, together with 6,500 alumni living all over the world. In 2015, SPH faculty attracted a research portfolio of $47 million, with a current grant portfolio of $180 million. The School continues to pursue a dual focus on excellence in research and scholarship and a deep commitment to boots-on- the-ground public health education, aiming to train the next generation of public health practitioners. Inclusion in the top-10 public health schools has given SPH a benchmark for the future. Says Dean Galea, \"It certainly helps to motivate us to continue to expand our research and educational efforts, and encourages us to look ahead to further engaging the public health challenges of the next decade, and the next. \"SPH has moved up to #10 in the U.S. News & World Report ranking of public health schools. That reflects the challenge we've given ourselves to create, share, and use knowledge and make change happen on a global scale. \"I THINK THIS REFLECTS THE EXTRAORDINARY WORK OF OUR FACULTY, STUDENTS, AND STAFF OVER THE SCHOOL'S HISTORY.\" \u2014DEAN SANDRO GALEADAN AGUIRREBOSTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH | SPH THIS YEAR | 25 TOTAL RAISED BY SPH SO FAR$43 MSPH CAMPAIGN UPDATE RANKING U.S. NEWS & WORLD REPORT BEST GRADUATE SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH 10 TOTAL APPLICATIONS, FALL 2015APPLICATION NUMBERS 2,661 STUDENTS 1 ,060 STUDENTS AT SPH 43 CURRENT STUDENTS' COUNTRIES OF ORIGINSCHOLARSHIPS AWARDED FACULTY FULL-TIME 151 PART-TIME AND ADJUNCT 206SPH BY THE NUMBERS 91%2014 GRADUATE EMPLOYMENT EMPLOYED FULL-TIME OR PURSUING ADVANCED EDUCATION WITHIN 6 MONTHS OF GRADUATION EMPLOYED IN GLOBAL HEALTH POSITIONS 80% EMPLOYED IN DOMES - TIC PUBLIC HEALTH POSITIONS 20% $6,787,638SCHOLARSHIPS RESEARCH AWARDS M 107%OF 2017GOAL $60 2015 $1 80 M CURRENT GRANT PORTFOLIONEW CAMPAIGN GOALBOSTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH | SPH THIS YEAR | 27 alumni A YEAR BEFORE 9/11, as a student at the School of Public Health, Kathryn Brinsfield (MPH'01) already had bioter - rorism on her mind. Her career has since centered on how to prepare for, respond to, and recover from this and compa- rable health threats, leading to her appointment as head of the Office of Health Affairs (OHA), the principal authority advising the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on medical and public health issues related to national secu- rity and long-term policies. Alan Sager, SPH professor of health law, policy & man- agement, recalls when, in 2000, he asked all students to write their professional interests on index cards, and Brinsfield surprisingly wrote \"boosting citywide interest in bioterror preparedness. \" She was \"clearly ahead of the pack in anticipating prob- lems we might face down the road, \" Sager says. The White House announced Brinsfield's appointment as OHA assistant secretary of health affairs and chief medical officer in February. Also a physician, she had been asso - ciate chief medical officer and director for workforce health and medical support at DHS, in addition to serving as acting director since 2013.From 2012 to 2013, Brinsfield worked directly for the White House national security staff as the director of medical preparedness policy. She joined DHS in 2008 as the associate chief medical officer and director for workforce health and medical support. Previously, she held leadership roles for the Emergency Medical Services of the City of Boston Public Health Commission.

George Annas, William Fairfield Warren Distinguished Pro- fessor of Health Law, Ethics & Human Rights, and Sondra Crosby, associate professor of health law, ethics & human rights, as well as of medicine, referenced the US Senate Intelligence Committee's 600-page report on torture, released in December 2014. Annas and Crosby say that CIA and US Justice Depart - ment attorneys enabled the role of medical professionals in torturing prisoners by assuring them that they would not be held legally responsible for violating US and international law against torture, as long as they used \"enhanced interrogation\" techniques approved in legal memos crafted by the Justice Department and would be present to prevent perma- nent harm to prisoners. Confining torture to legally defined methods is impossi- ble, Annas and Crosby argue. In reality, they say, physicians and lawyers \"consistently gave themselves permission to do whatever they agreed among themselves was important to do (to 'save lives'). \" They write that there are indications that the physicians involved initially had \"mixed feelings about direct involvement in torture\" but evolved into active participants. \"Whether torture 'works'\u2014 like whether slavery 'works'\u2014 is simply the wrong question, \" they conclude. \"Both are internationally recognized as crimes against humanity that have no justification, \" and \"attorneys will have to stand with physicians who want to maintain their ethics. \"Physician and Lawyer Collaboration Enabled CIA T orture, Professors Say CONFINING TORTURE TO LEGALLY DEFINED METHODS IS IMPOSSIBLE, THE PROFES-SORS ARGUE.

And, in many ways, it is. But, Boston also has some extraordinary differences within its borders. Using a simple device, the T , we ask: What do health indicators and the drivers of health look like there?The following is an edited, abbreviated version of Sandro Galea's Dean's Note of March 29, 2015. First, to get oriented, the map (right) shows the stops we'll discuss. Note that the distances sep- arating them are not great. It's also worth noting that in a city extraordinarily rich in health care facilities, none of the T stops are particularly far from at least one of them. But, as you will see, although the T stops are practically down the street from one another, they are \"health worlds apart. \" We can start with a core health indicator: premature death rates per 1,000. In the area around the Arlington stop, the premature death rate is more than 50 percent lower than for Dudley Square. This is linked, in no small part, to health indicators like violence. For another core indicator, low birth weight, the health differences reach the order of 25 percent. There are similar differences, of similar magnitudes, for adult non-communicable disease indicators such as diabetes.ARCHIVED DEAN'S NOTES bu.edu/sph/deans-notesPremature death rates per 1,000 (1999-2001)Percent of families below the poverty line (2008-2012)1.9 mi3 mi 2 mi 4.6 mi4% 2.614% 4.3MAVERICK12% 4.4 5.7 4.4SOCIOECONOMIC AND HEALTH INDICATORSGeographic distance between T stopsFIVE T STOPS The T map shows these health indicators are inexorably linked to a broad range of social indicators: poverty is a frequently used summary indicator of socioeconomic position. It is then not surprising, given the data, that poverty rates in some parts of Boston are four to eight times higher than those sur - rounding the healthier stops on the T . Other measures of socioeconomic position, such as education, track accordingly. This, then, tells a story of a city richly characterized by top-of-the-line medical resources and overall health indicators that are enviably good, but that has, within it, substantial heterogeneity in those same health indicators, associated in large part with variation in the fundamental socioeconomic circum- stances that produce health in populations.

In the study, published in the Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syn- dromes, Matthew Fox and colleagues found the rate of mortality was higher in patients who were lost to treatment\u2014defined as at least three months late for a scheduled visit\u2014than for those in care. Fox, SPH associate professor of epidemiology and a researcher with BU's Center for Global Health & Development, and his coau- thors report that, per 1,000 patient-years, the overall death rate at the clinic was 41.1 deaths, but it was substantially higher in the first year of treatment (96.2 deaths) than in the second year (31.2 deaths). Overall, dropping out of treatment accounted for a minority of the total number of deaths at the clinic from 2004 through 2012. About 47 percent of deaths occurred before a patient's last sched- uled visit, and another 18 percent occurred within one month of that date. The study says the high mortality early in treatment \"suggests that death is more likely to lead to loss from care than the reverse, yet what happens in the short window around loss remains unknown. It is possible that critically ill patients, sensing that death is near, simply leave care to return home or are unable to make it to the clinic. \" The authors stress the need for continued, careful monitoring of the relation- ship between mortality and retention in ART care.HIV+ and Early Mortality: Rate Double for Patients Lost to T reatment Does most mortality in patients on ART occur in care or after lost to follow-up?

The $1.2 million grant for the initial phase of the study will help track the incidence of pertussis in the first six months of life, when infants are most susceptible to the disease, says Christopher Gill, an SPH associate pro- fessor of global health, who heads a BU research team working in Zambia. Prior field experience has shown that immunizing mothers against influenza and tetanus can help reduce the incidence of these dis- eases in very young infants. Gill's team plans to swap out the current tetanus vaccine in favor of the combination tetanus, diphtheria, and per - tussis vaccine (TDAP). The Zambia team is one of three separately led and funded research teams; the others are in Pakistan and South Africa. For the first year, each team will track a birth cohort of about 2,000 babies to see how much pertussis actually occurs at the specific locations. Every two weeks, babies will receive nasal swabs to detect the presence of DNA sequences of the Bordetella pertussis bacterium. The Zambia site alone expects to conduct about 70,000 swabs over the course of the year, Gill says. Once investigators have a more accurate measure of the incidence of pertussis in babies, they expect to be able to launch randomized trials. \"At the very least we're going to know a lot more about the epidemiology of pertussis in very young infants, \" Gill says. \"Right now we know next to nothing. \"Helping Low-Income Countries Curb Pertussis in Infants THE $1.2 MILLION GRANT FOR THE INITIAL PHASE OF THE STUDY WILL HELP TRACK THE INCIDENCE OF PERTUSSIS IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF LIFE, WHEN INFANTS ARE MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE DISEASE.HIV DEATHS OCCURRED BEFORE A PATIENT'S LAST SCHEDULED VISIT47% OCCURRED WITHIN ONE MONTH OF SCHEDULED VISIT18% SHOULA/PHOTONICA/GETTY IMAGES \u00a9 PIYAL ADHIKARY /EPA/CORBISfeatureWHEN TALLYING the societal benefits to Botswana of secondary education, add a health-related advantage to the list. A School of Public Health study found that extra school years spent past grade 9 substantially cut the risk of HIV infection\u2014especially in girls. A team headed by Jacob Bor, SPH assistant professor of global health, examined countrywide educational reforms of the grade structure of secondary school that expanded access to grade 10. In a country with one of the world's highest HIV infection rates, about 25.5 percent, researchers found that each additional year of secondary school led to an absolute reduction in the cumulative risk of HIV infection of 8.1 percentage points. Among females, researchers found a drop of 11.6 percentage points. The study was published online in The Lancet Global Health. \"Our study is among the first to link secondary schooling causally, not just to risk behaviors but to HIV infection itself, \" Bor says. \"The fact that our findings are consistent with the literature on behaviors in many other settings suggests that investments in secondary schooling might be a good strategy to reduce HIV risk in many countries with large, generalized HIV epidemics. \" In 1996, Botswana decided to move grade 10 from senior secondary schools to the more numerous junior secondary schools. The simple change in grade structure triggered a cascade of follow-on effects, Bor says. \"By shifting grade 10 from senior secondary to junior secondary, the policy increased the benefit of grade 10 education, because now grade 10 was required to attain a junior secondary certificate, where previously it was only grade 9, \" Bor says. \"It also reduced the cost of attending grade 10 because it brought grade 10 closer to people, so they did not have to travel as far to get to school. \" The change also reduced the number of people ending their formal education after grade 9.

Published online: June 28, 2015. natural exit point became after grade 10. \"There was a huge jump in grade 10 completion, and one of the other impacts of that policy is that students who stayed on to grade 10 likely discovered that they liked school and wanted to stay on until grades 11 and 12. So this led to a very sharp increase in educational attainment, \" Bor says. The study authors conclude that increasing progression through secondary school could be a cost-effective HIV prevention measure across different HIV-endemic settings, in addition to yielding the expected societal benefits of better education. \"From the perspective of HIV prevention, schooling has to be part of the conversation, because it is at least as cost-effective as some of the other things already being considered, \" Bor says. \"This suggests that it might not be some fancy new program to help us fight the prevalence of HIV. It might just be expanding access to something that we already know how to do, which is secondary education. \"HIV INFECTION RATE 8.1 % 11.6 %BOSTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH | SPH THIS YEAR | 35 BOTSWANA 25% DROP IN HIV OVERALL INFECTIONDROP IN HIV INFECTION IN FEMALESEACH ADDITIONAL YEAR OF SCHOOL LED TO AN ABSOLUTE REDUCTION IN THE CUMULATIVE RISK OF HIV INFECTIONBOSTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH | SPH THIS YEAR | 37 research A study led by the School of Medicine and coauthored by School of Public Health researchers points to a possible increased risk of cognitive impairment from playing youth football.

In an article that looks at the United Kingdom's National Health Service (NHS), Austin Frakt, SPH associate professor of health law, policy & management and a health economist in the VA Boston Healthcare System, writes that competition can exist in both a private health care system, like that of the US, and in the UK's national- ized health care system. Since 2006, NHS practi- tioners have been required and paid to ensure that their patients are aware of five choices of hospitals. Data on hospital quality are available to patients to help them make choices. Those choices affect hospital revenue, which encourages hospitals to compete for patients on quality, Frakt says. \"The only way for a hospi- tal to thrive is to improve its attractiveness to patients.... And failing hospitals are at heightened risk of closure, \" he writes. Frakt, who is also an asso- ciate professor of psychiatry at BU's School of Medicine, cites a number of studies that have found that greater competition is associated with better management\u2014 which has been tied to better outcomes, including reduced lengths of stay, lower infec- tion rates, shorter wait times, and even lower mortality. Research also shows that quality diminishes when hospitals consolidate and competition is reduced, he says. \"T oday, US health care markets are going the other way\u2014they're consolidat - ing, reducing competition.

In 2009, the US Preven- tative Services T ask Force issued updated guidelines recommending that regular breast cancer screening start at age 50, rather than 40, paired with a call for shared decision making (SDM) between doctors and patients, especially for women younger than 50. The study examined the effect of two elements of SDM on the use of mammogram screening: patient-perceived choice and patient-provider communication. Published in the Journal of Health Communication, the study found that only 31 percent of women under age 50 perceived having a choice to undergo mammography. But when they did, they were more likely than others to opt for the screening. \"Our findings support the notion that SDM has yet to be fully realized in clinical practice, \" the study says. \"When patient values are in conflict with expert recom- mendations, it is an oppor - tune time for physicians to engage in discussions with patients\" and to support informed decisions. Patient-provider com- munication\u2014which was measured using a seven-item scale\u2014had no significant association with mammogra- phy utilization. The study, led by Christine M.

ERPRODUCTIONS LTD/GETTY IMAGES SCOTT CAMAZINE/SCIENCE SOURCEBOSTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH | SPH THIS YEAR | 41 viewpoint A SIGH OF RELIEF came from the White House and at least 6.4 million households when the US Supreme Court upheld federal tax credits for people who buy health insurance through the federal health insurance exchange. As President Obama said, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is here to stay. Chief Justice Roberts wrote the decision for the majority, once again saving President Obama's signature legislation. But, this time, the court only needed to interpret the statute. This would be a rather ordinary task for the justices, were it not for the enormous economic and political consequences hinging on the outcome. The plaintiffs argued that people who buy insurance on the federal exchange were not eligible for tax credits to help pay premiums because the ACA states that the credits are calculated based on the premium of a plan purchased through \"an Exchange established by the State. \" This would mean that people using the federal exchange would not receive tax credits, because their states have not \"established\" a state exchange. The plaintiffs were from Virginia, which uses the federal exchange. They did not want to buy health insurance or pay a penalty. If they were not entitled to tax credits, they would be exempt from the individual mandate (and penalty), because their premiums would exceed 8 percent of their incomes. The chief justice rejected this hyper- literal reading, writing, \"It would be implausible that Congress meant the Act to operate in this manner. \" His opinion recognized that, absent the tax credits, not enough healthy people could afford A SUPREME COURT MAJORITY PUT THE LAW AND PUBLIC HEALTH AHEAD OF POLITICS IN UPHOLDING THE AFFORD - ABLE CARE ACT.A healthy dose of JUSTICE for ObamaCare to buy insurance, and insurers would have to raise premiums or drop out of the market\u2014defeating the Act's purpose. The chief justice wrote, \"Congress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them. \" It is the court's assumption of responsibility to interpret the ACA that is key to this decision. It means that even under a future administration, the IRS cannot redefine the meaning of \"established by a State. \" The court agreed with the IRS interpretation of the disputed phrase, but found that interpretation was not the prerogative of the IRS. The majority held that Congress did not delegate interpretive authority to the IRS on this \"question of deep 'economic and political significance' that is central to this statutory scheme. \" Instead, it was the court's responsibility to \"determine the correct reading\" of the text. Now, only Congress can change the result. Justice Scalia, who wrote a characteristically hyperbolic dissent, joined by Justices Thomas and Alito, called the majority opinion \"jiggery pokery\" and \"pure applesauce, \" concluding, \"We should start calling this law SCOTUScare. \" The court did indeed insist on having the last word. But, in this case, the majority justices acted more like a court of law than politicians. The following is an edited, abbreviated version of a commentary by Wendy Mariner, the Edward R.

The study, published online in the Journal of Ger - ontology: Biological Sciences, finds that for people who live to age 90, the chance of their siblings also reaching age 90 is relatively small\u2014about 1.7 times greater than for the average person born around the same time. But for people who survive to age 95, it is 3.5 times greater\u2014and for those who live to 100, it grows to about 9 times greater. At age 105, the chance that a sibling will attain the same age is 35 times greater than for people born around the same time. Study leaders Paola Sebastiani, SPH professor of biostatistics, and Thomas Perls, MED professor of medicine, say the findings advance the idea that genes play \"a stronger and stronger role in living to these more and more extreme ages, \" and that the combinations of longevity-enabling genes that help people survive to 95 years are likely different from those that help people reach the age of 105. \"These much higher relative [chances of sur - vival] likely reflect different and more potent genetic contributions to the rarity of survival being studied, \" the authors conclude, \"and strongly suggest that survival to age 90 and survival to age 105 are dramatically different phenotypes with very different underlying genetic influences. \"Role of Genes Is Greater as People Live to Older Ages CHANCE OF A SIBLING REACHING THE SAME AGE 1.7x 3.5x 35x 9x 105 YEARS OLD 100 95 90 Increasing sibling relative risk of survival to older and older ages and the importance of precise definitions of aging, life span and longevity.
