This image is ubiquitous in north India, where this macho, uber-masculine version of the lord seems to appeal to a large section of the youth. But there is another gentler, compassionate version of \"the destroyer\" that is also loved and revered. Around mid-February , when Mahashivratri comes around, scores of women fast for the Shiva who is an ideal one-woman man; the devoted husband who loves his wife deeply and passionately , and treats her as an equal. In his many forms, Shiva has universal appeal; a god both benevolent and fierce, he is the lord and protector of all living beings, who is as much at home in the sacred groves of southern India as he is in the higher reaches of the Tibetan plateau. In this issue, as our writers travel to places infused with the essence of Mahakal, they find answers to questions about spirituality , get moved by the intense devotion of others, and feel the stirrings of lapsed faith. Author Anand Neelakantan, the screenwriter of the \"Bahubali\" films, takes us through the ancient Theyyam and Bhuta Kola traditions of Kerala and Tulu Nadu that celebrate the lord while challenging caste hierarchies (page 26). Author Kavita Kan\u00e9 explores the legends of Mangesh and Khandoba and Goa (page 44), and Kavitha Yaga Buggana writes about fulfilling a childhood dream of visiting Mount Kailash (page 34).

Cherry blossoms, Mount Fuji, manga and anime, origami and sushi are a few cliches most people associate with the island country. However, prepare to let this bubble burst since Japan is much more than this. From peaceful shrines and stunning landscapes to high-tech skyscrapers and futuristic toilets (yes, you read it right!), the country is the perfect one- stop destination for everybody. Tokyo, Osaka, or Wakayama are all must- recommended additions to your bucket list, whether you go there with your family, partner, or solo. Popular Indian television presenter Maniesh Paul couldn't agree more with the versatility of Japan. The Delhi- born and bred anchor and model has recently been on a family trip to the island country. The places he went to? Well, they included the busy metropolis of Tokyo, the port city of Osaka and the sacred prefecture of Wakayama. From the nostalgic atmosphere of popular Tokyo eatery Gonpachi Nishi-Azabu, which brings you back to a Japan of a bygone era, to the massive Tokyo tower, which serves as the symbol of the country's rebirth after World War II, tourist spots in Japan offer a memory of a lifetime for families. And what's better to top these up than the annual winter illumination at Keyakizaka, beside Roppongi Hills? It makes for an excellent visit for family and loved ones between mid-November and Christmas Day. What say Mr Paul? Couples and solo travellers fret not! Avneet Kaur, popular actress and model, also had an experience of a lifetime in Japan, where she visited the same cities as Paul. Whether it's Tokyo's iconic Shibuya Crossing, the tea ceremony experience at the historic Imperial Hotel, or the 360\u00b0 open-air observation deck SHIBUYA SKY, couples have ample options to choose from a plethora of fun activities\u2014 something Kaur could vouch for. Also on any couple's Japan bucket list should be the beautiful city of Wakayama, located in the Kansai region, which is also home to Osaka and Kyoto. For the unacquainted, Wakayama is the undiscovered gem of Japan; it is home to some of the country's most revered and stunning beaches, drawing enlightenment-seeking pilgrims and beach-bound sun lovers. The city is full of surprises, from the Kumano Kod Pilgrimage Route and the Koyasan temple complex to the glistening white sands of Shirarahama Beach and the Nachi Falls, the country's tallest (133 m) waterfall. It is also home to the magnificent Wakayama Castle and a unique ramen recipe of its own. Overall, Japan, which has over 2,100 Indian restaurants (yes, you will get your thali easily), is one of the top vacation locations in the world for families and couples since it is exciting, intriguing, and safe. It doesn't matter if you are travelling with infants, toddlers, or teens; Japan's fascinating and diverse culture provides something for everyone. Not to add that Japan offers couples personal and thrilling moments with their loved one while learning about the country's rich history and traditions.A safe, clean and exciting country, Japan has all the certificates for a great holiday Left and above: Maniesh Paul and family enjoying at Kumano Kodo, , t h e r e , n o w & Soon On a J OuRney WIth In 12 CaMPI nG a CROSS SCO tLan D 14The n o-engine greek r oute On the island of Hydra, locals turn to old ways in the absence of vehicles The rapidly turning wheels of time slow down on the Greek island of Hydra, where donkeys, horses and mules are used to get around instead of cars, bicycles and motorbikes. The tradition dates back to a 1950s presidential edict aimed at keeping Hydra's distinct and charming architecture intact. Curved like an amphitheatre and rising like a hill, the 10-mile-long island is studded with old stone houses along narrow paved paths and steep stairs leading uphill. To spot a car being driven on these paths isn't just far-fetched but unimaginable because of how impractical it is. The only engine-run vehicles are the two garbage trucks. But the archaic suggestion of walking or using domesticated animals is gladly accepted to get to the other corner of the island. The penchant to do things the old way can also be seen in how the many restaurants, bars and hotels dotting the island are all quaint and family-run, as they have been for generations. The continuation of such dated practices doesn't mean that the few-hundred inhabitants of Hydra live a cocooned and disconnected life. The escape Hydra presents from deafening honks seduces many travellers visiting Greece despite its solitary and unique way of life. compass PHOTOGrAPH: SHUTTerSTOCKTRAVEL PROMOTIONTRAVEL PROMOTIONBIRDING the largest brackish lake in Asia, is located in the eastern state of Odisha in India. It is a unique habitat combining marine, brackish, and freshwater ecosystems, which enables its rich biodiversity. The lake is spread across the districts of Puri, Khurda and Ganjam and is the largest brackish water lagoon in Asia. Fed by 52 rivers and creeks, the magnificence of Chilika lies in its sheer expanse of water spread area, which varies from 900 sq. km to 1165 sq. km in summers and monsoons, respectively. The pear-shaped lagoon is about 64.5 km long, with its width ranging from 5 to 18 km. The lagoon is broadly divided into four ecological sectors based on salinity and depth. A survey of the fauna of Chilika by the Zoological Survey of India in 1985-87, had recorded over 800 species in and around the lagoon. The list includes several rare and endangered species like the Barakudia Limbless Skink, the Irrawaddy Dolphin, and the Chilika Buffalo. It is the largest wintering ground for migratory birds in the Indian subcontinent. The abundant fish populace of Chilika, comprising about 317 species, enables the livelihood of more than 0.2 million fishermen. The lake's seagrass meadows are expanding despite anthropogenic pressure, which signifies a healthy lake ecosystem. MANGALAJODI Tucked away in the northeastern fringe of Chilika Lake in Odisha lies Mangalajodi, a ten sq. km wetland that sees more than three lakh migratory birds in winter. This little hamlet harbouring rich wetlands is comparatively lesser known than its famous parent lagoon. The Chilika area is recognised globally for its incredible biodiversity. Mangalajodi is one of the largest of the 132 villages on Chilika lake's banks and is classified as an Important Bird Area (IBA). The present generation of inhabitants of Mangalajodi village recount that this wetland has been a winter home for migratory birds for as far back as they can remember. Birds migrate here from as far as Baikal Lake, Aral sea, Caspian Sea Mongolia, Central and Southeast Asia, and from places closer to home like Ladakh. Bar-headed Geese, the highest flying birds in the world, Black-tailed Godwits, with four species of sandpipers, three species of stints, and various species of ducks like Pintails, Shovelers, Greylag and many other species winter at Mangalajodi every year. These birds arrive in the region by the middle of October. The marshy wetlands interspersed with reeds and vegetation consisting mainly of Typha angustata and Phragmites karka and expanses of water running through the channels provide food and shelter to these waterfowls and raptors until they start moving back to their breeding grounds by February-March. What makes Mangalajodi a haven for birdwatchers is the proximity to birds. While other wetlands and water bodies in India might foster a larger number of winter migrants, at Mangalajodi, birdwatchers and tourists can watch birds from a very close range as they boat through the channels. This makes Mangalajodi one of the most favoured destinations for bird photographers who return to the habitat year after year. At Mangalajodi, one can discover the rich flavours of the Chilika ecosystem and the joys of birdwatching in one of the most exquisite natural landscapes in India. \u2014Avinash Khemka is an avid nature lover, photographer and conservationist.

Rarely do we take time to look inwards. \" I dismissed his comments at that time as feverishness of a restless mind. Are we travellers not lucky to experience what the world has to offer in all its forms\u2014the sounds, the sights, the smells? Don't we gain more experience of the world around us as we engage more deeply with it? I went on about travelling to places afar, chasing more experiences, and diving a tad deeper into each sensory encounter. Years passed, and Jakob and I lost contact. However, his comment that I had dismissed as an outcome of a hallucinatory mind stayed with me. What does it mean to look inward, I wondered. Every December, I head back to India from Sweden for a month to escape the Nordic winter. However, in Delhi, where I usually come to, I find myself wrapped in down jackets and quilts through that entire month. This winter break, though, I took a break from Delhi and headed to the warmer South. The purpose was not only to escape the NitiN Chaudhary The Journey inwards North Indian winter but also to learn a new skill to help me keep fit while on the road. And that's how I checked myself into a yoga retreat in Bangalore. On day one, they said that yoga is a union of body and mind, a retrieval of senses inward. Suddenly , Jakob came to mind. Curiosity arose as I settled down for three weeks-long classes to learn different poses. Twenty others had joined the classes together with me. Within the first few days, we fell into a rhythm, waking up early in the morning to walk through the softly swaying palm trees before starting our daily practice of asanas on neatly laid mats. The late mornings were filled with knowledge from Patanjali's yoga sutras, and evenings focused on learning anatomy , and how yoga impacts different bodily functions. However, the regimented days at the yoga school constrained me, and set routines bored me. I wondered aloud why I shouldn't travel instead and explore new places to entertain myself. \"That's because you are looking for pleasure outside, \" said my teacher when I shared my concerns, \"give it a few days and look into what's happening inside you when you do these asanas. \" I stayed, taking the course as a challenge to test my patience. I found the yoga postures basic, in comparison to heavy weightlifting in the gym back home that I am used to. However, my teacher invited me to stay in a posture long enough and watch what was happening inside. So, there I was\u2014bent 90 degrees in Trikonasana, looking up at my other hand. Minutes passed, sweat trickled from my forehead, the drops slowly merging into a drip pouring onto the floor. I felt uncomfortable initially , but I stayed in the posture and noticed the burning sensation that had engulfed my stretched arm. A smile appeared out of nowhere. I realised what was happening to me. Even in that not-so-difficult pose per my standard, I was burning and dripping in sweat, yet peacefully watching the flow of energy , prana, inside me. For once, I was not interested in chasing experiences or fearful of what I was missing out on by not engaging with the world outside. For once, I was calmly exploring the rising and falling contours of my breath that marked my convoluted posture. The initial disquiet faded, and I completed the 21-days yoga course. On these days, I had not travelled anywhere and remained inside the enclosed campus. I stayed with my experiences, learning how my breath became my best friend in these sessions. It was a tool I had not thought much about, but here it was at my disposal to help me calm down. I am now back to my regular life, past the walled gardens of the yoga school to the open world. However, I noticed a shift, a form of peace that has stayed with me since the course ended. A thought came to me\u2014sometimes exploring places and travelling is not the only option we have. At times, going inwards is also a journey worth taking.

Budget hotels and Airbnb can cost anywhere between 40 (if you're fortunate) to 100 pounds per night. In r upees speak, you could easily run through an average month's wages in just a few days. Unless you simply go camping instead. If you didn't already know this, Scotland is one of the few places where wild camping is still permitted. It is legal to make a home for the night on (nearly) any piece of open and vacant land. This is despite nearly all of the property being privately owned. Even neighbouring England and Wales\u2014all part of the United Kingdom\u2014only allow camping within designated campsites you need to pay rohith ashok Wild and Free for. However, the Scots still allow you the opportunity to, quite literally , live wild and free. There are, of course, a few caveats, but they are largely aimed towards ensuring safety and limiting environmental impact. All required and very reasonable, in my opinion. It seemed too good to be true when I first heard about this. Now, on the other side of my trip, I can assure you it is entirely legitimate. Over ten days, I had several opportunities to test the limits of this freedom, and I'm happy to report that I didn't encounter any . In fact, given my past experiences in India, I often expected that someone would show up and ask me to get moving along. But, on the few occasions I met someone near the camp, they were happy to see me there and often gave me suggestions of other great spots to look up further on my journey . This acceptance and encouragement of an outdoor-oriented lifestyle was a refreshing change for me. I spent a few nights beside a famous Loch (lake) and one in an open field at the foot of a mountain. My favourite spots, though, were a series of scenic perches that I found at different points along the coast of northwestern Scotland as I rode down the North Coast 500. Every morning, I opened the top flap of my tent with a sense of excitement, not knowing what I would get to see. And, every single time, the view that lay in wait only seemed to get better. If I didn't have the pictures to prove it, I would already find some of this hard to believe. I realise that camping isn't for everyone and it's definitely no bed of roses. There are limitations in terms of comfort and convenience that can, in many scenarios, make it seem like a lot of effort for very little reward. But, for me, every night in the wild in Scotland was worth its weight in gold! Ti spent a few nights beside a famous Loch (lake) and one in an open field at the foot of a mountain.

While the entire state boasts a large number of avian faunae, with the Hornbill being the state bird, many endangered resident birds are also found here. Arunachal Pradesh is a favourite birding destination for birders from India and abroad. The state has some beautiful sanctuaries which dot its hilly and heavily forested terrain. You can choose from Zemithang village in Tawang, the Sela Pass between Tawang and West Kameng, to Mandala Top in Dirang valley, Sangti valley, east Kameng Bhalukpong region, and the Eagle Nest Birding Sanctuary in Kameng. Each of these regions is home to specific birds, as well as some which are common to the entire state. There are about 25 Notified Important Bird Areas in Arunachal Pradesh. Around fourteen winter migratory bird species come to Arunachal Pradesh. Some of the migratory birds which arrive during the winter are the Amur Falcon, which flies from Siberia to the Tirap district of Arunachal Pradesh. Tirap is its stopover area for a few weeks before it flies to South Africa. Then there is the endangered Black Necked Crane from Tibet flying into the remote region of Zemithang in the Tawang district. Recently, three new species of migratory birds were found in the Ziro district: the Spotted Redshank, the Black- Headed Gull, and the Peregrine Falcon. The Spotted Redshank was photographed here for the first time. The wealth of avian fauna of Arunachal Pradesh goes beyond the ordinary, as its climate and forested landscape are ideal for indigenous and migratory bird populations to thrive. Pack a pair of binoculars, sturdy shoes, a hat, and a flash-free camera, and head out to see the treasure trove of birds in Arunachal Pradesh. Website: www.arunachaltourism.comEagle's Nest Wildlife Sanctuary, West Kameng The avian wealth at the Eagle's Nest Wildlife Sanctuary is simply stunning and draws birding enthusiasts from across the world. The Bugun Liocichla (Liocichla Bugunorum), a critically-endangered passerine bird species, is found only in this sanctuary. The species has been named after the local Bugun tribe. The other rare birds found here (Harpactes wardi), and Black-tailed Crake (Porzana bicolor). You also spot a lot of the unusual looking Striated Bulbul (Pycnonotus striatus), the Stripe- throated Bar-winged Wren-Babbler (Spelaeornis troglodytoides). In addition to these, there Blue-Flycatcher (Cyornis unicolor), all small- sized birds. In 2017, the Bugun tribe declared more than 17 square kilometres of their land as the Sinchung Village Community Reserve. This Reserve is the buffer zone of the Eagle's Nest Wildlife Sanctuary.

It is said to have been essential to the universe's origin and is believed to be the instrument that produced the first nada, or sound, before creation when there was only a void. Shiva subsequently created the universe by performing the tandava to the rhythm of the damaru. The damaru also stands for the universe's overall beat. Hinduism holds that the universe has a cyclical character and is perpetually being created, preserved, and destroyed; therefore, the constant expansion and contraction of the universe are represented by the damaru's beats.

A partial carnival of sorts; some stretches made me feel alone in the world, and others were full of life, brimming with people, tea stalls, night markets and groups of folks just dancing to chants of \"Jai Shri Mahakal.\" On my seat in the auto rickshaw, I was warm from the night-time bonhomie as the chilly breeze licked my skin. \"Do not forget to take your press card, \" Ajay Ranawat, protocol manager and guide at the Mahakaleshwar temple, had advised me. \"You'll be admitted in a second and taken to the VIP viewing area. \" Once I reached there, the situation was different. Clearly , everybody is \"very important\" in the eyes of God. Being in a queue to be blessed by a darshan of one of the 12 jyotirlingas is not the easiest of tasks. The ebb and flow of smoke and water, as you keep pushing in, is by sheer force of will, or the call of the almighty , as some might say . One of the most revered jyotirlingas in India, the Mahakaleshwar temple in Ujjain draws the devout and the ambivalent Words: AntARA cHAttERjEE A couple was in front of me, with a two- year-old asleep on the father's shoulder. Surprisingly , despite all the chaos going around the congested pathway to the main chamber, the baby seemed to be having the best sleep of his life. There were two divergent lines\u2014the VIPs and the not\u2014both converging at the sight of God, intermingling to equality in his eyes. wAlking Among the Gods As I entered through the main gate of the premise, massive pillars etched with intricacies detailing each of Lord Shiva's avatars and their significance, stood organised at scattered distances. The Olympian figures of the statues gave me the impression of what it might feel like if someone were to walk through the gates of heaven. But I quickly dispelled the thought, choosing to marvel at the brilliant architecture and the meticulous details of the edifices. Each looming structure had its plaque cataloguing the event it was fashioned on\u2014the Ardhanarishvara avatar, where and Neelkantha avatar during samudra manthan; the killing of the demon Tarakasura's three demon sons. There are 108 pillars, all depicting some form of the \"Controller of Time\" and \"Destroyer of All Elements\" Lord Shiva, that line the Mahakal Path towards the main temple. The corridor, spread over 2.5 hectares, houses an open-air theatre, a museum of mythology , and a lotus pond with a statue of Lord Shiva meditating at the centre of it. the jyotirlinga of mahakal all decked up after pradesh exploreof time, Sp Ace And Divinity Ujjain has held great spiritual and religious significance for Hindus since ancient times. A 4th-century text on astronomy claims that Ujjain is situated at the intersection of the Tropic of Cancer and the Zero Meridian, which makes several temples in the city bound by time and space. But even an auspicious location like this did not make it any easier for pilgrims to make their way to the temple before Prime Minister Narendra Modi opened the first phase of the expansion of the Mahakal corridor last of MP Tourism Board. \" Along with the hotel business, employment opportunities have also increased locally . Tourists visiting Ujjain also visit places like Omkareshwar, Mandu and Indore, so these areas are also benefitting. \" The stunning five-storeyed facade of the temple was constructed mid-18th century , and its famed marble walkways were restored towards the end of the 19th century by the Scindias of Gwalior. Now when you walk amidst the Gods, you might imagine them coming alive at any moment, whispering a chant, or just peering down upon you with bottomless eyes. The Navagraha Mandal, dedicated to the nine celestial divinities in Hindu mythology , has been roped off to prevent the public from harming the figures. twiSt of faith \"It is rare for humans to be born in Bharat, and even rarer is the opportunity to worship Shiva, \" is the quote that greets you at the entrance to the temple. For an atheist like me, it is enough reason to scoff. But being surrounded by intense devotion emanating from everyone coming and going makes you question yourself. One of the 12 jyotirlingas in India, the most important sites of Shiva worship, the Mahakaleshwar temple is the only one where the linga faces south, which is known as the direction of Yamraj, the God of Death. People worship this version of Shiva-the master of death-for the life of their loved ones in peril. My mother was a staunch follower of Mahakal up until her death. My trip to the temple made me experience one of the most potent pulls of my lapsed faith. The feverish activity of the day slipped away from my tired mind as I watched, rooted in fascination, the majesty of the bhasma aarti. I felt the guilt of my faith seeping into my atheist heart with every chant and every throw of the ashes. bhASmA aarti \"The Akhand Dhuna burns behind the Omkareshwar temple on the second floor, blessed with Vedic mantras and an immortal flame, which is never to be extinguished, \" said Sachin Pujari, one of the priests at the temple of Mahakal. \"This temple has been here for aeons, and regardless of new developments and infrastructure, the October, to decongest and beautify the temple and its neighbouring area. \"It used to be very congested, and the only way one could get to the temple was from the back alleys, \" said Anil Dagar, who plies devotees to and from the temple in his auto rickshaw. With the PM's nearly Rs 900 crore Maharaj Mandir Parisar Vistar Yojana, the footfall has increased, and the area has undergone a facelift. \"Since the inauguration of Mahakal Lok on October 11, the number of tourists in Ujjain has increased by 40-50 per cent, \" said Sheo Shekhar Shukla, Managing Director A devotee dressed as lord ujjain the pradesh explore most devoted have always come here, and we have provided them the best service we could offer. \" Spanning the first three floors are the holy structures of Mahakaleshwar, Omkareshwar Mahadev , and the Nagchandreshwar, respectively . Each of the three temples has its importance. The Nagchandreshwar temple, which occupies the topmost floor, opens for only 24 hours in one year, and is accessible to devotees on the occasion of Naga Panchami. The self-manifested Mahakaleshwar lingam resides in an underground sanctum, where devotees queue up from midnight to visit. In the chill of the wee hours, bare-chested men in dhotis and women in thin saris moved ahead in the queue, buoyed at the prospect of seeing their devotion come to fruition with a glimpse of their Bhole Baba (innocent god). I stood in a heavy coat, being the sceptic I still was. And then I was inside. The bhasma aarti is a ritual where the ashes, made by kindling a fire using cow dung, branches of the amaltas, peepal and other trees, are used to awaken the conqueror of death, Mahakal. The aarti starts at 4 am, with devotees lining up to witness something they cannot describe with mere words. This time, I was one of those dumbstruck devotees sitting in awe amidst thundering damarus (small two- headed drums), and shankhs (conch shells). Women are asked to cover their eyes when the jyotirlinga is being inundated in ashes as then the Lord is believed to be in bare form, and can only be seen by men. But beyond the binary of life and death sat the Lord, and I sat opposite, eyes downcast, wondering how easy it would be for me to find him here. \"We visited the temple when the corridor was still under construction, \" said Krishnapriya Pandey , a student and devotee. \" Although our journey was laborious and not as easy as it is now for others, watching the bhasma aarti made all the pain and sweat worth it. \" This is the beauty of Mahadev's towns\u2014the rustic charm of its people and the raw call of its traditions. You will hardly find a God so liberal; he lets you in with no requests. I had brought a sari because people told me I wouldn't be allowed to watch the aarti in regular clothes. And yet, there I was, sitting at the Nandi Mandap with my eyes fixated on the ash-doused jyotirlinga. When it came to offerings, among the heaps and heaps of expensive, bejewelled saris and dhotis, varieties of sweets and savouries, there was a lone plate heaped with Cadbury milk chocolates right next to the Lord.camera, I could only rely on my memory to preserve the mythological presence of Lord Shiva through the many murals and statuesque depictions of his existence. The last night of my stay in Ujjain was spent sleeplessly , thinking about hope and happenstances. The next morning, as the sun slowly peaked over the horizon, I was weaving out of the city crowd as fast as the night dissipated. Goodbyes overwhelm me, especially conflicted ones involving my faith. As the pink-tipped clouds turned to gold with the rising sun, I tried to escape this city that confused me. I bowed my head, and a silent sigh of prayer escaped me.

Unlike the vigour of the thumping damarus and chants of Mahakaleshwar, in this temple there is calm in the chaos of devotees. \"This is where Baba comes to rest,\" said our guide Sunil ranawat. \"It's said that the island was a gem in Satyayuga that turned into a mountain of gold in Tretayuga. Copper replaced gold in Dwaparayuga and now, in Kalyug, Mandhata is an island of rock.\" As I walked back from the temple, I noticed a miniature of the \"Om'' symbol abandoned on the windowsill of the sanctum, I nicked it on a whim. I wondered if it would be considered stealing someone else's calm, or surrendering my chaos to the lord of Omkareshwar.

Yieldable price means that when the demand in that micro market is high, the price recommendations go higher, while if the order is low, the price recommendations are lower than actual display rates. This would enable hoteliers to manage the sales propositions based on demand visa vis-\u00e0-vis internal occupancy and other influencing factors. sysotel.ai can show the value proposition to Hoteliers by enabling them to increase the RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room). It has seen at least 15-18 per cent growth in the figures, meaning hoteliers can now sell the rooms at the rates of their choice. sysotel.ai is the only AI tool that lets hoteliers control the business by completely automating the distribution and operational capabilities. The native channel manager enables hoteliers to send rates and inventories to all the partners with the touch of a button. Changing The Hospitality Industry, One Step At A Time Currently, there are close to 2.2 million available rooms to be sold in India, out of which about 70 per cent of inventory is sold every day, which is close to 1.5 million transactions. On the flip side, close to 700,000 rooms do not get sold for various reasons. sysotel.ai is working closely with industry stakeholders to reinvent the demand. One of the hoteliers' biggest challenges today is high customer acquisition costs. It is a whopping 15-18 per cent every time the guest comes to the hotel, i.e. for every INR 100 the customer earns, INR 18 goes as the acquisition costs. sysotel.ai has been able to help hoteliers build alternate sales channels, which will ensure the acquisition costs come down to as low as 2 per cent from 18 per cent. Hoteliers value the cost reduction as the new sales channels are helping them save over 40 per cent of their operating profits and garner traction on their brand websites. In totality, sysotel.ai can set up an ecosystem that increases revenues by 15-18 per cent and reduces costs by over 12-13 per cent, which by far is the most outstanding value proposition that a hotelier enjoys, all this at zero deployment costs and a mere 4-5 per cent of revenue share.

Always wanting to be his own \"boss,\" Sahu-after working for many big brands-realised that he was better cut for entrepreneurship and not service. The thought of starting his venture consumed Sahu's days and nights. He actively sought an idea or a solution in his domain that resonated with him. With friends and co-founders Ravish Patel and Kiran Suthar, this is how he came up with sysotel.ai, a SaaS firm that provides end- to-end hospitality solutions. Come 2021, Sahu officially registered sysotel.ai. \"sysotel.ai is an automated yield management system especially targeted at mid to small hotels. Such a system in the open marketplace is costly. Only the luxury segment hotels use it, and even theirs is often manual. The one we have built is highly automated. It integrates artificial intelligence and machine learning without hitting your pocket. Thus, it is a highly advanced yet cost-effective solution,\" Sahu said while talking about sysotel.ai's USP. Hospitality's Innovative Platform sysotel.ai comprises a compact automation platform for revenue and yield management. This platform, based on raw, reliable, and relevant data, is based on market data analysis with the aid of AI and ML, facilitating the hospitality industry. The technology assists in ascertaining raw data from the prevailing market to channelise optimum solutions to the right target customers. Furthermore, the platform helps scrutinise the collected raw data and provides expertise based on AI's explanation and logical reasoning to cater to your business' revenue. \"We provide comprehensive, wise, affordable and profitable solutions for our patronage, which are majorly segmented for mid-to-small scale hospitality independent ventures and groups,\" Sahu said. The most prominent problem hoteliers face is the optimum price to sell the room. They go by historical data to arrive at the sellable rates, and while the recorded data holds to some extent, it is always a significant risk of not being able to sell at the correct price. When the founders of sysotel.ai faced similar challenges, they devised an idea to set up an artificial engine to arrive at these decisions. sysotel.ai: Hospitality's Pathbreaking Platform sysotel.ai is the only AI tool that lets hoteliers oversee the business by entirely automating the distribution and operational capabilities Hotelier and entrepreneur Raj Sahu is the brain behind sysotel.aifebruary 202326 explore W where doeS Shiv A reSide? we will get A v Ariety of AnSwer S depending on whom you ask. The conventional answer would be to place the abode of Shiva on Mount Kailash, but one can say he resides in the many holy shrines dedicated to him. He lives in the 64 jyotirlingas, or abode of lights, spread across India. Some may insist on considering only the 12 jyotirlingas as important. For them, Shiva resides as Somnath Rudraprayag (Uttarakhand). Then there are majestic and beautiful Shiva temples such as Lingaraja in is also Shiva who resides in graveyards or in cremation ghats, along with his bhuta ganas. An elegant and eclectic answer to the question may be anbe shivam\u2014or love for everyone and everything, which is the essence of Shiva. Shiva lives in truth and beauty , or satyam, shivam, sundaram is another answer. Shivoham or \"I am Jungles LORD Of the Shiva lives in our hearts and in the forests of south- western india, caressed by the breezes from the Arabian Sea and the spice hills theyyam and bhuta k ola are ritualistic art forms that narrate the legends of ShivaWords : \"you too are it or him\"\u2014that is, Shiva resides in each of us\u2014 could be another answer. But there is no Shiva or any god, and that he is a figment of the imagination is as much a valid answer as everything is Shiva, and there is nothing other than Shiva. It is this indefinability that makes Hinduism unique and inexplicable. This is what makes it enduring, endearing and confusing\u2014simultaneously . However, unlike other theistic concepts of Hinduism, the idea of Shiva cannot be restricted to the pages of philosophy or the constraints of the temples. Another A bode for Shiva Far from the precincts of holy temples and jyotirlingas, far away from the snowy peaks of the Himalayas or the crowded ghats of the Ganges in Varanasi, there is another abode for Shiva in a small sliver of land between the Arabian Sea and the Western Ghats. Though Brahminical Hinduism has worked out an uneasy coexistence with this essentially tribal god over the centuries, the tribal and rebellious nature of this tradition is hard to ignore. This Shiva links our culture to a distant tribal past that predates even the Indus Valley Civilisation. The super hit film \"Kantara\" (2022) gave a glimpse of this world and brought this tradition to the mainstream. As someone who grew up in this culture, it is surprising to see how little space such traditions have in our mainstream. The Kirata Shiva or tribal Shiva is the lord of the jungle. He rules over the countless sacred groves of this land, sharing the sacred precincts with his consort Bhagavati. He has his ganas or companions of various species and races of humans, semi-humans and animals. Unlike the mute idols of the temples that depend on elaborate rituals conducted by priests, this Shiva, Shakti and their companions speak and walk with the people. Though there are ritualistic dance forms such as the Padayani, Mudiyettu and Thirayattam in other parts of Kerala, Kola, Kola or Nema of the Tulu region, are the most striking of these ritual art forms. Shiva and his consort Bhagavati and Bhadrakali (sometimes depicted as the daughter of Shiva) descend on earth to perform an awe-inspiring ritualistic dance. They dance to the rhythmic beats of asuric drums, gongs and cymbals. Sometimes, prominence is given to the sons and daughters of Shiva and Bhagavati. These offsprings of the divine couple are not their well-known children such as Ganesha or Kartikeya but Panjuruli, Gulika, etc. Sometimes, their companions dominate the show. theyy Am And bhuta Kola The Theyyam ritual includes an oral history and a narration of stories known as Thottam. Part myth, part legend and part oral history , these stories rival the Puranas written in Sanskrit or classical Tamil. It is a parallel world that challenges the traditional Brahminical narrative about gods. Although, one can also find Brahminical tenets and glimpses of the philosophy of Adwaita in many Thottam songs, the philosophy is made more relatable to the common people. On the other hand, the Padannas, the Tulu counterpart of Thottams used in Bhuta Kola, still retain a more purist tribal influence, emphasising and the occult. When Namboothiris (a Malayali Brahmin caste) arrived in Kerala from North India around the 8th century , they were granted land by the ruling warrior clans. Many of the sacred groves held by tribal and other communities were a part of this land grant. In the typical Indian way of coexistence, the tribal gods were integrated into the myths and pantheons of Brahminical Hinduism and stories intermingled with each other The upper castes ritually and socially controlled Theyyam, making the performer a helpless dependant of their munificence. The blessing of Namboothiri priests before the beginning of the ritual became institutionalised. The rituals, however, retained their tribal nature. Rice, meat, fish and toddy are the staple offerings to Theyyams, something unthinkable in traditional temples. In part myth, part legend and part oral history, these stories rival the puranas written in Sanskrit or classical tamil. it is a parallel world that challenges the traditional Brahminical narrative about gods theyyam dancer getting ready for onam celebrations theyyam dancer in South india dressed as a local deity called MuthappanPHOTOGrAPH: GeTTy IMAGeS PHOTOGrAPH: GeTTy IMAGeSoutlook traveller31 explore exploreglow like a thousand eyes from the fire pit. The eyes of the gods penetrate deep and stir your conscience, which drags out long- forgotten memories and opens up wounds you thought had healed. Time folds and unfolds, merges and dissolves, stands still and races forward. You don't see Theyyam. You enter another universe. When the piercing cry of the Kurumkuzhal pipes is punctuated by the unearthly roar of the god or the goddess and spirals to a frenzied climax, you realise that, finally , you have found where Shiva lives. Words cannot describe that moment. One recent times, though, toddy has been replaced by drinks such as tea and fish by chickpeas in some temples. The right to perform these ritualistic art forms are restricted to members of the Vannan, Malayan, Velan and Mavilan communities, all scheduled castes or tribes. The moment the artiste takes on the attire of Theyyam, he is no longer human but a deity . It is fascinating to see how the caste hierarchy gets inverted in the ritual. In the past, when untouchability was the norm and the caste system was rigid, Theyyam and Bhuta Kola demolished the boundaries, at least during the duration of the performance. When Theyyam speaks, it is the god speaking, and no upper caste person can ignore that voice. Theyyam acted as a check and balance against the brutal nature of the rigid caste system. The Theyyam season begins after the harvest in October and continues till the advent of the monsoon (May-end to June). It is the time to thank the gods and ancestors for a bountiful harvest. Myths and folklore are associated with the ritual. There are more than 500 different Theyyams in Malabar and Kuttichathan and Pottan are some of the prominent deities that feature in Theyyam. There are Vaishnavite-influenced Kariyathan but even in these rituals the worship doesn't stray from its tribal identity . The food served breaks all taboos of satvik temple food. finA lly, the answer Theyyam is egalitarian. You do not go to worship the Theyyam but to communicate with the deity . Theyyam will speak to you, listen to your woes and give you practical suggestions. The ritual is sure to overwhelm your senses. The black of the night and the ethereal silence of the sacred grove before the performance create an uneasy expectation. Torches slowly light up. From the womb of the jungle, Shiva or one of his bhuta ganas or devi emerges. In a vivid display of colours, predominated by its striking red hues and shining black lines, exaggerated by the flares of fires and torches, the gods appear\u2014so near that they can be touched and spoken with. Embers can only experience the aura of the divine, feel the tug in one's heart, the whisper in one's ears of some ancient chants. It doesn't matter whether you are a believer or a sworn atheist, a confused and rootless city-bred Indian, or a temple-hopping traditionalist, Theyyam is sure to evoke primeval tribal memories hidden in your DNA. reimA gining Shiva You realise that the original Pashupati, the lord of the beasts, the lord of the world, doesn't belong to the dark, cloistered sanctum sanctorum of temples, where he is infantilised, woken up, bathed, dressed and paraded in a palanquin or on an elephant. Nor can he be living at the lofty heights of distant snow peaks, bathed in silence. When you watch Theyyam, you can't imagine Shiva or his bhuta ganas living anywhere but here and now, in the steaming jungles of south-western India. The trident on the crown, the serpent When the piercing cry of the kurumkuzhal pipes is punctuated by the unearthly roar of the god or the goddess and spirals to a frenzied climax, you realise that, finally, you have found where Shiva livesmotifs painted over the body , and the frenzied dance all give a glimpse of some ancient tribe that would have originally conceived Shiva or seen him in the womb of this sacred jungle. Shiva, who wears an elephant skin on his waist and sits on a tiger skin, is adorned with cobras and wears ashes on his body , could only be imagined by some ancient tribal priest. The image of Shiva on a snow-clad peak starts looking incongruous and unreal. He belongs here, in this humid air, rich with the fragrance of incense and the acrid smell of coconut oil. His abode is where he is served toddy and fish. He dwells where he and his companions can enter the body of a tribal and dance to the ritualistic and energetic beating of the chenda drums. In these groves, caressed by the breeze from the Arabian Sea and the spice hills, he lives with his bhuta ganas and countless children, protecting humans from their greed.

Horizontal black rock lines contrast strikingly with the white snow covering the slopes. Along the vertical groove running down the middle, narrow ledges appear like rocky steps, and I have the crazy thought that this is a staircase for giants. An icy wind blasts my face. I pull my green jacket closer and resume walking. My cousin, Pallu, walks beside me, and our six travel companions from all over the world are already ahead. Our guide, Chirring Cap Lama, and his assistants keep a watchful eye. Twenty-five years ago, when we were young girls, Pallu and I had planned this trip. The journey represented adventure, breaking out of the cocoons of our conventional lives. It's hard to believe we are in places we had only dreamed about. *** It's the first day of my Kailash trek. Behind me lies Darpoche, the starting point. The flat ground in Darpoche is strewn with mani stones and yak horn offerings. Mani stones are small rocks inscribed with a prayer to the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara. Thousands of wispy white, orange and blue Buddhist prayer flags hang on lines. I am walking in sacred spaces. Mount Kailash is where Mahadeva, the great God Shiva, lives with his wife Parvati. Hindus consider Kailash the holiest of places. To Tibetans, Kailash is Gang Rinpoche (Precious Jewel of the Snows), the abode of the powerful Buddhist deity Demchok and his consort, Dorje Phagmo. The first Jain prophet, Rishaba, achieved enlightenment in Kailash, and Jains worship the mountain as Mount Ashtapada. To the Bon people, it is Mount Tise, a crystal snow mountain in which resides the great Lord of Tise, who rides a crystal-white lion.34 Kailash, one of Hinduism's holiest sites, is not just a mountain of rock and snow but a repository of myth and legend Gods abODe Of the Words : kavitha Yaga Buggana extraordinary sacredness, Kailash remains unclimbed; one can only circumambulate the mountain. Hindus call this circular journey parikrama, and Buddhists call it kora. Our group is following the approximately 52 km outer parikrama. The inner parikrama, about 35 km, runs closer to Kailash but is so challenging that few dare attempt it. It is said that one must acquire the merit of completing 13 outer parikramas to qualify for the inner parikrama. Thirteen parikramas seem as achievable as a trip to the moon. My boots crunch on the ground as I drag myself up the slope. In the oxygen-thin air, my body already feels heavy . We are above the tree line at an altitude of over 4,500 meters. Sculpted over centuries by unrelenting wind, sun, and snow, giant cliffs form rippled and complex landscapes.Other than the black and white of Kailash, I am engulfed in a sea earth; tawny pebbles; scraggy wings of the eagle flying overhead; the Tibetan gazelle perched on a distant slope. Despite this stark beauty , my eyes long for green, and my legs beg for rest. The tea house is a large tent. Chirring warms himself at a stove and waves Pallu and me inside. Thermos flasks and teacups stand on painted wooden tables. Hindu and Tibetan pilgrims and Western adventure travellers sit on wooden chairs and benches topped with brightly coloured rugs. A Tibetan sips salty , creamy yak butter tea. After hours in silent, open spaces, I am cheered by the cosiness of the indoors and the roar of conversation. \"Hey! We're here!\" someone calls. Chatting and laughing, Pallu and I sip steaming black tea with our group. Though this is the first day of the Kailash parikrama, our group has been travelling together for over two weeks. We spent the first five days trekking through Nepal's pristine and picturesque Humla Valley . When we crossed into Tibet, we set up camp at Lake Manasarovar. Under cloudy skies, the waters of Lake Manasarovar appeared grey; patches of orange grasses covered the shore. *** Manasarovar is a lake of legends. Brahma is said to have created the sarovar (lake) from his manas (consciousness), so divine beings could bathe in its waters before praying to Shiva in Kailash. It is believed that these heavenly beings descend on the lake at night as glowing lights from the sky . Manasarovar's waters are considered so pure that one dip in them can wash away all sins. Katy , a fellow traveller from Canada, calls Pallu and me over for a dip in the lake. We joke that if we had known our sins would be washed away , we would have sinned some more. I run into the freezing waters and stayed submerged for as long as possible before running out, shivering and laughing. I fill a bottle to take water home for my family . Late that night, I am outside my tent in the Manasarovar campsite with Prarthana, a friend and traveller. Suddenly , Prarthana points at the lake. She exclaims, \"What's that?\" A round, vibrating light shines in the distance. Is it hovering on water like in the myths? Or is it a camp light on the opposite shore? I can't decide. I call Pallu, but the light has disappeared. We stand and watch, but the light doesn't shine again. *** We sip the last of our tea and resume the parikrama. Kailash is always to our right, and at every angle, it looks different: a face, a man reclining, a lingam. We pass an older Tibetan woman and man prostrated on the ground. They rise, walk the length of their bodies, and then prostrate again. Their journey , Chirring tells me, will take two or three weeks. They seem to worship not just Kailash but every pebble, insect, and blade of grass in these sacred spaces.

Our fatigue has faded. We walk along a small stream with water from the melted snow of Kailash. The mountain displays its magnificent north face, which has a rounded top and is less blanketed in snow than the south face from the journey's start. Stone and snow shimmer under the sun in stunning contrast. Moving clouds create an illusion of a moving mountain. The closer we get to Kailash, the higher it seems to loom. Faced with the enormity of the hill, I realise the minuteness of my body , the inconsequentiality of my life. In the vastness of the universe, we are nothing. Katy , Pallu, and I drink cold water from the stream. We sit apart in silence. I close my eyes. The wind roars above, the stream gurgles by my feet, and my breath is warm. I am calm; I am elated. I am filled with silence; I can hear every sound. What will happen tomorrow ceases to matter. I'm here now, aware of my body , the stream, the wind. Even with my eyes closed, I can see the mountain.

Formed from a darker and older stone than that of the stone of the surrounding mountains, it's also the tallest geological deposit of its kind in the world. Four major rivers\u2014Sutlej, Brahmaputra, Indus and Karnali\u2014have sources that originate in this region. Throughout the journey , I've seen waterfalls and streams and wondered which river or lake they feed. The waters from this region keep millions of people alive. Kailash is both a mountain of rock and snow and a mountain of myth and legend. As Mount Meru, it's the centre of the universe. On its slopes is Kubera's marvellous city , Alaka, which Kalidasa extols in his poem, \"Meghadootam. \" On Kailash, Ganesh was brought back to life with an elephant head. Even the rocky black lines on Kailash tell a story . Ravana, the king of Lanka and Shiva's great devotee, decided to carry Kailash to Lanka. He tied strong ropes around the mountain and lifted it. As Kailash shook, Shiva smiled. Gently , he pressed down his little toe. Under the weight of Shiva's toe, the mountain fell back to earth. Trapped underneath, Ravana realised his folly and, overwhelmed by the compassion of Shiva (who didn't kill him but taught him a lesson in humility), a rapturous Ravana composed and sang the rhythmic \"Shiva Tandava Stotram. \" He sang of Shiva's beauty , the crescent moon in his matted locks, the garland of snakes. To worship Shiva, he proclaimed, is to put aside ego and look upon the world with equanimity . Pleased with the song, Shiva released Ravana. The ropes fell from Kailash but left their black lines on the mountain. The marks of these ancient legends follow us around the mountain of myths. *** The first camp is about 5,200 meters in altitude. Across the valley , at the base of a slope, is the orange Drira Phuk Monastery . We're at the closest point in our journey to Kailash. When Katy suggests we trek to get closer, Pallu and I pick up our trekking poles. Due to its extraordinary sacredness, kailash remains unclimbed; one can only circumambulate the mountain.

We had driven along National Highway 44 to Awantipora, approximately 30 km southeast of Srinagar. After a quick check with a bystander, we retraced our steps and found what we were looking for\u2014the Avanti Shovra temple, also called Avantishwara. We walked through the gate across well-manicured lawns towards the skeletal structure of what must have once been a grand edifice. Ruins are strewn all over the grounds\u2014a section of a column here, the remains of a capital there. The ravages of time are apparent, but the still visible engravings are awe-inspiring. The garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum) is bereft of any shivlinga or idols. That is the status of most ancient temples in Kashmir, and there are scores across the Valley . *** Kashmir was a significant centre of Hinduism in the first half of the first The remains of ancient Shiva temples in Kashmir hold the key to the region's Shaivite past Words & Photographs: Santosh ojhaetched timeIn millennium. Buddhism, too, was an important religion under the Mauryas and Kushanas. Kashmir was the base for Buddhist monks travelling into China and the rest of East Asia, and Buddhism spread from here to neighbouring Ladakh, Tibet and China. The dominance of Hinduism strengthened when a succession of Hindu dynasties ruled Kashmir, starting from the seventh century , when the Karkota dynasty came to power.According to Gurgaon-based Sunil Raina, a scholar of Kashmir's ancient history and religion, \"King Lalitaditya of the Karkota dynasty was a Shiva worshipper, and it was under his patronage that many grand temples were constructed. He granted land to Vaishnavite and Shaivite scholars and constructed a Buddha statue at his capital city , Parihaspora. \" Around the 9th century , Kashmiri philosophers developed what came to be the bumzuva cave and temple tourists climb large steps to reach Shankaracharya temple, Srinagar COUrTeSy: WIKIPeDIA outlook traveller43 february 2023 42 JAMMU AND KASHMIR explore JAMMU AND KASHMIR exploreAvantivarman's son, Shankaravarman, who succeeded him in the late 9th century . Shankaravarman shifted his capital from Awantipora to Pattan and renamed it Shankarapattana. Determined to build a few temples of his own, he named the Shankaragaurishvara temple after himself and the Sugandhesha temple after his wife. Both had Shiva as the presiding deity . As I approached the Shankaragaurishvara temple, I was taken aback by a loud banner announcing a rubaru (face-to-face) programme with local youth. Chairs were being arranged on the lawns surrounding the temple, and a loudspeaker system was being set up. Crowds were milling around called Kashmiri Shaivism. \"God and the soul were regarded as one, \" explained Dr Ravi Dhar, who has spent many years researching spirituality and Shaivism. Avantivarman, the first king of the Utpala dynasty , which succeeded the Karkotas, established his capital at Awantipora, where he built two important temples\u2014Avantishwara and Avantiswami temples. The latter is located nearby and has Vishnu as the presiding deity . *** Pattan is a sleepy little town on the road to Baramulla from Srinagar. The otherwise ignored town is known for its two fabulous temples built about 1,200 years ago by in anticipation. I have been to many sites managed by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), but this was the first time I had seen them being taken over for an activity like this. I approached the ASI staff for answers, but the young recruit seemed to have none. I decided to spare him and focus on the task at hand\u2014exploring this ancient temple. Years of pillage have taken their toll, and the remains are difficult to decipher, though I spotted an enormous engraving on one of the walls. It's most likely a representation of Shiva, but it is difficult to say because of the mutilation it has undergone. The Sugandhesha temple is a smaller version of Shankaragaurishvara temple, but better preserved. Architectural fragments are scattered throughout the temple courtyard; fluted columns, bracket capitals, and broken pieces. Interestingly , King Shankaravarman is said to have started his reign well but became a tyrant, much hated by his subjects, towards the end of it. To top it all, he cannibalised the ancient capital of Kashmir, Parihaspora, to build the two Shiva temples. The legend goes that while his father's name still survives in the name of Awantipora, Shankaravarman's capital Shankarapattana is known just by the name Pattan; his subjects decided to erase any memories of their hated king. *** \"Kashmiri temple architecture is distinct from the rest of India. While some of it is inspired by the Gandhara style, there are influences of Roman, Greek and Buddhist architecture, \" said Ashok Pandey , a veteran archaeologist who served in the ASI with devotees offering prayers to Shiva in the Shankaracharya templethe starkness of the garbhagriha is startling\u2014just two shivlingas on a platform under a rough-hewn ceiling.

I would not have undertaken this trip if it wasn't for my excitement at seeing the oldest existing temple in Kashmir. The redoubtable chronicler of ancient Kashmir, Kalhana, wrote about the temple in his famous \"Rajatarangini\" in the 12th century and dated this temple to about 371 BC. I stopped midway near a kerbside stall selling religious souvenirs. The Sikh gentleman running the booth gave me an encouraging smile as if egging me on to keep walking. I reached the platform and washed my hands and feet before I climbed the last few stone-paved steps to the temple, which sits on an octagonal base. The sanctum sanctorum is dark, with a large shivlinga adorned by a snake. I bowed and paid my respects before I started my downward climb. *** The ancient temples are ghosts of their former selves. It's as if Lord Shiva is reminding us about the impermanence of it all. However, while the man-made structures have all but perished, Shiva exists in the culture and traditions of Kashmiri Pandits. Even today , a Kashmiri Pandit wedding is incomplete without \"Posh Pooja\"\u2014a ritual where the bride and the groom are covered with a cloth and worshipped as Shiva and Shakti with offerings of flowers denoting the union of two into one. T two long stints in Jammu and Kashmir. \"Virtually all the Hindu temples of the era have a standardised design with a trefoil arch (three-lobed arch) and straight-edged pyramidal roof, along with columns and triangular pediments. \" An excellent example of these two architectural features is the 12th century Bumzuva Cave Temple. A short drive from the famous Martand Sun Temple, it is located in Bumzuva village. At the base of the 50-step climb, one can spot the two smaller temples that were converted into ziarats\u2014Muslim shrines\u2014 several centuries ago. I climbed 50 steps or so and came across the temple's beautiful fa\u00e7ade. It is located in a cave carved into a massive limestone cliff overlooking the Lidder River.

Terrified, she calls her husband for protection, but her words get jumbled up. \"Hey Girisha Mamtrahi,\" she wants to say , asking the Lord of the Mountains to protect her. Instead, she says, \"Trahi mam Girisha.\" Hearing these words, Shiva, who had assumed the form of a tiger to frighten his wife, instantly returns to his normal form. But her plea for help becomes an iconic name for her rescuer. Since then, Shiva, in parts of Western India, is also known as Mam Girisha. And over time, Mam Girisha has become Mangesh. temple tales Perched on a hillock amid thick forests in Goa, the temple in Priol village is known as Mangueshi. It is believed that devotees discovered a shivlinga in the area where Shiva had taken refuge and built a temple there. It is one of the largest and most frequently visited temples in Goa. Shiva, as Shri Mangesh, is the kuladevata (family or clan deity) of the people of the region. Devotees throng the temple for festivals such as Magha Purnima (Jatrotsav) and Mahashivratri. The temple's name has another legend attached to it\u2014the Mangesh linga is believed to have been consecrated on the mountain of Mangireesh on the banks of the River Bhagirathi by Brahma.

Startled, she cries out: \"Trahi mam Girisha! \u2014 Oh Lord of the Mountains, save me!\" Hearing her plea for help, the mollified husband rushes to her rescue. This story has been passed on from generation to generation, and many will know that the couple in the mythological tale is Shiva and Parvati, playing a game of dice at their snowy abode, Mount Kailash. Shiva loses to Parvati, staking his possessions one after the other. In the last roll, he stakes his home. Having lost Kailash, he has to leave the Himalayas. Dejected, he wanders southwards, crosses the Sahyadri and enters the dense forest of Gomantak. In Kailash, the forlorn Parvati leaves home to search for him, crossing rivers and mountains, and finally enters the forests where Shiva has taken refuge.

Copper figurines of Khandoba riding a horse (sometimes with Mhalsa) are worshipped by devotees in household shrines. Legend has it that two lingas appeared where the demons were killed, giving rise to the Khandoba temple, standing proud on a hillock in Jejuri near Pune. incluSive Ways A rich legacy of ballads and stories hails Khandoba, elevating him from a folk deity to Shiva, the destroyer. Khandoba's two wives\u2014Mhalsa and Banai\u2014are identified as Shiva's wife, Parvati and Ganga, but with details that highlight their cultural and social moorings. Mhalsa and Banai are women from different communities and backgrounds, and their unions with Khandoba throw light on a deep socio-cultural connection between the divine and community . Khandoba's first wife is Mhalsa, from the merchant community; his second wife, Banai, is a shepherd's daughter. His marriage with Mhalsa was \"arranged\" and was conducted with rituals and revelry . Khandoba's love for Banai culminates in a \"love\" marriage. There are threads in the relationships that women across generations may identify with. Mhalsa is described as an excellent cook, while the sultry and free- spirited Banai has poor culinary skills. Mhalsa has a \"cultured\" background, as against the earthy , non-conformist Banai, who personifies \"nature. \" Folk songs recount tales of their quarrels\u2014the most prominent being that of Mhalsa's fury at the second marriage when Khandoba returns to Jejuri with his new bride. To ease the tension between his wives, Khandoba hands the upper half of the hill to Mhalsa and the lower half to Banai. The idol of Mhalsa is placed with Khandoba in the main shrine at top of the hill at the Jejuri temple, while there is a separate shrine to Banai, situated lower down. But there is more to these clashes than mere domestic disharmony: the fights between Mhalsa and Banai again reveal the essential conflict between nature and manmade norms, the wild against the restraint posed by social rules. The presence of his numerous other wives this part of the Deccan Plateau. He is the God of the Hills, a solar deity and a regional guardian, assimilating various regions and communities. He represents everyone\u2014 from the warrior, farmer and shepherd to priests, merchants and royalty , as well as hunter tribes native to the hills and forests of this region. He is also a subaltern god, embracing all communities. The legend goes that Shiva gifted the boon of invincibility to the demon brothers, Malla and Mani. The brothers wreaked havoc, destroying kingdoms and vanquishing kings and seers. Desperate, the seven most revered sages\u2014saptrishis\u2014 approached Shiva for protection. Realising that he had to undo his mistake, Shiva assumed the avatar of Martanda Bhairava or Khandoba, riding the Nandi bull and leading an army of gods, including his two sons Kartikeya and Ganapati and his wife and established a shrine there. But with time, the linga found another abode. As devotees feared the temple would fall under the invading Portuguese, they moved the Mangesh linga deeper into the forests to its present location at Mangeshi in Priol. Symbol of A cultur Al ethos Shiva, as Mahadev , is the beloved pan-India deity; worshipped in different forms across India from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and Saurashtra to Assam. Mostly represented as a yogi, Shiva is also described as a fierce deity , Bhairava, his militant form. One such avatar is Khandoba, also known as Martanda Bhairava, Malhari, or Malhar, is worshipped as a manifestation of Shiva and is the most popular kuladevata or the patron deity in Parvati, locally known as Mhalsa. Khandoba was as luminous as gold and the sun, covered in turmeric with a crescent moon on his forehead, holding the trishul, the damaru and the khanda (or the khadga), a double-edged sword. That was how he was named Khandoba. The war continued for six days. The gods finally defeated the asura army , with Khandoba killing Malla and Mani. A remorseful Mani, while dying, prayed for the well-being of humankind and offered his white horse to Khandoba, begging that he be present at every shrine of Khandoba, with an offering of goat meat\u2014a ritual that continues to be followed by Shiva devotees. His wish was granted. Mani was blessed, unlike his unrepentant brother, Malla, who\u2014before dying\u2014cursed everybody with death and destruction. Khandoba went on to decapitate him, earning the name and devotion as Khandoba did. That few can venture more than five steps merely confirms mortal limitations! yellow And Gold Khandoba is worshipped with turmeric. The Jejuri temple is distinct and unusual, embraced by the bright yellow of turmeric thrown around it. The hues are an ode to Khandoba, swathed in golden robes, distributing gold goodness. For the devotees at Jejuri, the turmeric signifies the riches Lord Khandoba would bless them with. His idol is often depicted with four arms. He holds a bhandara patra or a bowl of turmeric powder, and a sword. But Khandoba or Mangesh, to a cross-cultural swathe of people and places, is an interpretive faith not determined by strictly religious notions but by a socio-cultural ethos. The story of how Shiva becomes Mangesh and Khandoba illustrates how ancient folktales of the divine turn into a symbol of the cultural ethos of a land and its people. It is a narrative passed from one generation to the next through stories, songs, prayers, and belief. T Kavita Kan\u00e9 is a former journalist and author of seven novels romancing the word and the world of Indian mythologydisplays a strong inter-community connect. Khandoba's third wife, Rambhai, is a tailor who is both beautiful and talented. She is also worshipped as a goddess. His fourth wife, Phulai, comes from the gardener community , again celebrating the irrevocable bond between humankind and nature. Candai Bhagavin, the fifth wife, is the daughter of an oil-presser, another prominent sect in the region. Each marriage joins communities, reiterating that Khandoba is a clan god for all sections of people, the beloved God who grants wishes. As the husband of many wives, Khandoba is considered the God of fertility . Newly married couples visit Khandoba temples, particularly the shrine in Jejuri, seeking blessings on the consummation of marriages.

Your instructor wouldn't hear a thing during the flight; hence it is essential to pay attention.

Your body must maintain a specific position\u2014on your stomach, hands bent at the elbow, fingers spread out at eye level, and toes pointed out. However, it is more complicated than it sounds; the trick is understanding your body's aerodynamics and manoeuvre yourself to fly comfortably . Even a slight change in the arch of the back while flying could cause you to sink to the floor of the tunnel or suddenly soar up at full speed.

No wonder travellers of all types\u2014from day trippers and backpackers to families\u2014stop by long before the official Christmas season. Despite being a popular destination from the beginning, Die Toten Hosen, a German punk band from D\u00fcsseldorf, played a major role in promoting Altstadt's beer culture to the international crowd. In 1986, they released a track named \" Altbierlied\" (dark o on A pleASAnt And r Are Sunny november A fternoon In D\u00fcsseldorf's historical quarter, an enormous crowd huddled inside the Altstadt (Old Town) Markt. While the well- known Christmas markets drew them, I skipped the grand opening to beeline for a certain German ale at \"the longest bar in the world. \" When people think of the longest bar, the immediate image that comes to mind is typically a lively space sporting an absurdly long countertop with a see-and-be-seen vibe. Here, it is a symbolic designation given to a jumble of 260 bars, brew pubs, taverns and contemporary taprooms braided together that take up half a square kilometre of the district. Hiding in plain sight on a street called Ratinger Stra\u00dfe, it is the busiest neighbourhood in Altstadt and rightly so. One of the most enduring destinations along the east bank of the Rhine, this place has it all: an unassuming local beer, liqueurs that date back to World War II, 66 clockwise from left: d\u00fcsseldorf's Altstadt is full of bars and pubs; markets illuminated by christmas lights and decorations; view of the uerige brewery PHOTOGrAPH: SHUTTerSTOCKfebruary 202368 Germany livingbeer song) in which they sing the line: \"We have the longest bar in the world in D\u00fcsseldorf. \" Since then, more people are recognising the quality brews exclusive to this community and appreciating the people safeguarding traditional brewing methods that are rapidly being replaced by modern techniques. According to Ann Sparvoli, a cicerone with D\u00e4 Spiegel pub, drinking up in Altstadt before a jaunt up and down the street market is an unspoken tradition. \"Most people almost always explore D\u00fcsseldorf through its Christmas scene, \" she said. \"But ask any local, and you will learn that the secret to bearing the late-evening explorations when the markets are in full swing but the temperature is dropping low is a pre-shopping drink, more accurately , a couple of pints of Altbier\u2014a copper-brown beer produced in and around Rhineland and ubiquitous throughout the city . \" looking for altbier Keeping it very German, the most common question you will be asked at a bar is to choose between Alt or Pils, and while it is posed as a choice for the customer\u2014if you want to experience Altstadt like a local\u2014the right answer is Altbier. A chilled, energetic and toasty malted brew with a pronounced full-bodied earthiness that, when well-matched with a sidecar, can be a refreshing experience. This top-fermenting beer originated in Westphalia and soon inherited the name Altbier to distinguish itself from the pale lager, a style that came into existence in 16th-century Bavaria before reaching other parts of Europe. The name translates to \"old beer, \" hinting at the unique cold-fermenting method of ale production, unlike most other ales which are fermented at a relatively warm temperature. While there's a copious amount of origin history dating back hundreds of years, the Altbier you will discover today in D\u00fcsseldorf is a modern variation developed in the 19th century . brewing history You only have to visit Uerige Brewery , one of the four major brewpubs in the region, to see for yourself. The brewery is the perfect place to traverse through the rich history of Altbier with guided tours and tastings. Named after the business, their signature Uerige Altbier exemplifies their commitment to traditionality available throughout the year. By only using water, barley , wheat malt and Uerige yeast, they still adhere to the Purity Law\u2014an order passed by Duke Wilhelm IV of Bavaria stating \"nothing other than barley , hops, and water\" be used to produce beer. There's even a rock pub aptly named Auberge Rock serving an extensive list of German ales or digestifs like J\u00e4germeister as hard rock music spills through the door. Guests can sit inside and marvel at the neon, kaleidoscopic decor and, during busy weekends, skip the narrow room to grab a seat outside where you can still feel the loud bass ringing under your feet. Just south, not far from Auberge Rock, a craft-beer diner bringing Nashville's speciality hot chicken to D\u00fcsseldorf is well on its way to becoming the hippest nook.

He described how the intimate interiors of the pubs exemplify the idea of making people feel at home and how a timeless, crisp and malty ale can further age-old history to the next generation. \"Just like the title given to this place, tasting beer in Altstadt is more metaphorical than literal, \" he said. For Mr Ebert, serving beer is merely a means to an end; it is about the quizzical expression when someone tastes their first Altbier, the sigh of temporary respite from the cold rush of wind, and watching people trying to figure out where exactly is the longest bar in the world. TThe smallest home brewery is making it big with its signature Altbier, ALTfred and ALMA Hitchcoq lager. The hot chicken is undoubtedly the sidecar of choice, and for those who want to dabble outside the beer menu, Hitchcoq's natural wine is equally popular. Less than a mile away , Im F\u00fcchschen is another iconic spot brewing their secret recipe since 1848. Alt-style beer dominates the menu, so much so that you can only get a choice on Christmas Eve when they add Weihnachtsbier, a festive beer that momentarily steals the show. A few blocks from here, Squarebar is a bold and daring avenue where creative mixology takes centre stage. The interior drips with a retro-vintage decor: stone floors from 1912, an ice cream parlour marquise, and flowerpots from the late 19th century crown the entrance. Be sure to try Super Bittersweet 16, a cocktail made with Uko vodka, Pampelle bitter grapefruit, rhubarb shrub and goji powder. \"Introducing people to Altbier and inviting people from across the world on a pub crawl is more than an act of business. It is to preserve ancestry , custom and a way of life that would have been long lost if not for this closely-knit community , \" said Stefan Uerschels, a Rhineland native and brewer. While a drink here is a blast from the past and a modern-day unwinding experience stirred into one, the Rhineland cuisine served at most breweries alongside contemporary finger food deserves a spotlight moment. \" Alt, Pils, and K\u00f6lsch fare well with Sauerbraten, Halver Hahn, or Spekulatus, the most common question you will be asked at a bar in the old town is to choose between Alt or p ils, and while it is posed as a choice for the customer\u2014if you truly want to experience Altstadt like a local\u2014the right answer is Altbiercobbled streets near the historical centre house breweries and nightclubs PHOTOGrAPH: SHUTTerSTOCKRead what is R acy , Reliable and iRRep Ressible Y es, I would like to subscribe to the magazine(s) as indicated below: MY MAGAZINE CHOICE (s)tErMOutl OOk WEEKLYOutl OOk tr AvEllE r MONTHLYOutl OOk MONEY Date:______________ Signature:________________________________Please ll in this Order F orm and mail it with y our remittance to: Subscription Deptt. afdarjung Enclav e, New Delhi-110 029 Now subscribe from your mobile by scanning this QR Code:Subscribe to Outlook magazines and get special DISCOUNTSPRODUCTION OFFICE HEAD OF PRODUCTION PRODUCTION EXECUTIVE PRODUCTION SUPERVISOR PRODUCTION COORDINATOR COO MANAGING DIRECTOR BUSINESS OPERATIONS EXEC/EA TO COO/MD HEAD OF LEGAL AND BUSINESS AFFAIRS SENIOR LEGAL AND BUSINESS AFFAIRS EXECUTIVE HEAD OF FINANCE FINANCIAL CONTROLLER FINANCE ASSISTANT MARKETING DIRECTOR DEVELOPMENT PRODUCER SCRIPT EDITOR ASSISTANT SCRIPT EDITOR OFFICE ASSISTANT GENERAL OFFICE NUMBER DIRECTION/PRODUCTION DIRECTOR'S ASSISTANT EXECUTIVE PRODUCER PRODUCER CO PRODUCER LINE PRODUCER ASSOCIATE PRODUCER PRODUCTION PRODUCTION SUPERVISOR UNIT PRODUCTION MANAGER PRODUCTION COORDINATOR ASSISTANT PRODUCTION COORDINATOR TRAVEL COORDINATOR PRODUCTION SECRETARY UNIT MANAGER ASSISTANT UNIT MANAGER PRODUCTION ASSISTANT PRODUCTION INTERN OFFICE ADMIN OFFICE RUNNER IT TECH ON CALL ACCOUNTING FINANCIAL CONTROLLER PRODUCTION ACCOUNTANT ASSISTANT PRODUCTION ACCOUNTANT CASHIER ART ACCOUNTANT COSTUME ACCOUNTANT COST ACCOUNTANT ANIMAL WRANGLER ANIMAL WRANGLER ART - SET DESIGN PRODUCTION DESIGNER ASST TO PROD DESIGNER SUPERVISING ART DIRECTOR ART DIRECTOR SKETCH ARTIST GRAPHIC DESIGNER GRAPHIC ARTIST INTERN STORY BOARD ARTIST STORE KEEPER ART COORDINATOR ART - SET DECORATION SET DECORATOR SET DRESSER JUNIOR SET DRESSER ART RUNNER PROPS RUNNER INTERN ART - ON SET ON SET - ART DIRECTOR ON SET ASST ON SET ASST / CARPENTER ASST CARPENTER PAINTER ART - SET CONSTRUCTION ELECTRICIAN CARPENTER ASST.CARPENTER H.PAINTER PAINTER ASST PAINTER HELPER HELPER PROPS HELPER PROPS HELPER HAJERI MASTER TYPIST TYPIST ASSISTANT DIRECTORS FIRST ASSISTANT DIRECTOR ON SET 2ND AD BASE 2ND AD 2ND 2ND AD 3RD AD SET PA CAMERA DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY A CAMERA OPERATOR CAMERA - 1ST AC CAMERA- 2ND AC CAMERA- 3RD AC VIDEO SUPERVISOR (RUNNER) 1ST AC (SA UNIT) VIDEO ASSIST 1 (CAMERA RUNNER) A CAMERA - FOCUS PULLER CAMERA ATTAENDANT LENS ATTENDANT CASTING CASTING DIRECTOR ASSOCIATE CASTING DIRECTOR CASTING ASSOCIATE CASTING SCOUT CATERING / CRAFT SERVICE CATERING HEAD CATERING INCHARGE (MN UNIT) CATERER INCHARGE (SA UNIT) CATERING ASSISTANT 1 CATERING ASSISTANT 2 CRAFT SERVICE HEAD CRAFT SERVICE ASSISTANT COOK CHOREOGRAPHY CHOREOGRAPHER ASST CHOREOGRAPHER ASST CHOREOGRAPHER CHAPERONE CHAPERONE CHOREOGRAPHY CHOREOGRAPHER ASSISTANT CHOREOGRAPHER COSTUME COSTUME DESIGNER ASSOCIATE COSTUME DESIGNER ASST.

The vegetables in it are harvested and stored long before the snow sets in; the herbs are dried in the months when the sun still shines bright, and the yak meat is hung to freeze days before Losar celebrations begin in December. remA inS of the Season Located in trans-Himalaya and at an altitude of 2,900-5,900 metres above mean sea level, winter in Ladakh leans towards the extreme. The cold-arid desert experiences sub-zero temperatures and heavy snowfall, lasting at least six months. During this time, the only thing people in Ladakh can depend on for food is what they grew in the five summer months, from April to September. As Ladakh remains cut off from the rest of the world for these six months of harsh weather, the locals have developed indigenous storage and preservation techniques practised even today . Impressively , these techniques are anything but complex and exclusive, even if the situations confronted might be. \"To understand our food culture and why we eat what we eat, it is important to understand the agro-climatic and geo-ecological factors of the land, \" says Kunzes Angmo, food researcher, chef and founder of Artisanal Alchemy in Leh. Through her venture, Angmo has devoted herself to introducing people to authentic Ladakhi cuisine through experiential dining\u2014these include three-hour-long sit-down meals, complete with an exploration of Ladakh's history as narrated by Angmo herself. \" At the end of the day , what you eat depends on what the earth sustains. This predates any other factor considered PHOTOGrAPH: GeTTy IMAGeSIn ladakh, where winter brings extreme temperatures and heavy snowfall, people rely on indigenous practices of storing food Words: Shreya cheemaSummerPReSeRVI nG 72 Shakti Puraskar for contributing significantly to reviving Ladakh's age-old culinary traditions, laments the same. She says, \"Earlier, the same thing would taste so different. It would be so much more flavourful. \" mAking the Meat The practice of dehydration is not limited to fruits and vegetables but also includes meat and dairy products. This is specifically prevalent among the Changpa nomads in Changthang\u2014since they're always on the move, carrying dehydrated meat is easier and lighter. In villages across Ladakh, dehydrating meat begins much later, during the Ladakhi New Year, also known as Losar. \"The animal (most commonly yak) is sacrificed and is kept as it is for a few days till it gets frozen. After that, thin strips are cut and hung up in a dark room (a common feature in every house) to dry . Some people also rub salt on it, \" says Yangchan. The dried yak meat is most commonly used in thukpas, but Yangchan mentions another ancient local preparation using frozen meat, which resembles the French tartare (a raw meat dish). The meat is pounded and then mixed with spices, like yellow chilli flakes, salt and pepper. The dish, known as Shapchen or Sharjen, finally comes together when simmering cha khunag (light green tea) is poured over it. of the Past Ladakh's unique storage techniques and dehydrating methods resulted from its unique circumstances. For the longest time, the region had no choice but to depend on itself to make it through the six months of lapsed connectivity and severe scarcity . However, things have changed. \"In villages and among older communities, these traditions continue to prevail. Earlier, what had to be grown, can now be easily found in markets, even in winter, \" says Angmo. Self-reliance is not the only characteristic that bloomed even in harsh conditions. Earlier, people knew how to live harmoniously with nature. For instance, for the longest time, sea buckthorn was not a part of meals, as it is now. Angmo says, \"Our ancestors never harvested sea buckthorns. Instead, it was left for birds to feast on during the winter months. \" Although the younger generation has left these traditions behind, moving on to more convenient methods is one of many drawbacks. The primary issue is the lack of mention and documentation of these unique and innovative practices the region has depended on to survive the year's most challenging months. T Shapchenimportant, like food policies, exports and imports, and even religion, \" Angmo admits. Unique storage techniques were not the only discovery spurred by Ladakh's strained connectivity . Angmo explains, \"Sometimes, due to heavy snowfall, we were disconnected from the very next village and not just from the rest of the country . Every family , therefore, was a self-sufficient unit who grew what they ate and ate what they grew. \" To imagine carrots and turnips on the plate during any other time but in winter seems unlikely . However, these \"winter vegetables\" are grown and eaten fresh in Ladakh during summer. \"Every house has a trench-style room on the lower floor, which is completely dark and has no ventilation. This is where we keep the vegetables, grown in summer, covered with mitti or dry soil, \" says Angmo. Since the temperature can drop to -20 degrees Celsius, the vegetables are covered with a thick layer of mitti, which is much warmer, to keep it from freezing and not rotting. This process of \"root-cellaring, \" in a dark and closed room traditionally known as tsothbang, ensures that the vegetables stay fresh and edible until May . Angmo shares another way of storing these harvested gems in wait for the winter. \"My parents would also fill up big sacks with all the vegetables set aside for winter and dig up the garden to bury it. This would be covered with a layer of mitti for the same reasons. \" The pit, known as sandong, is at least 150-180 cm deep and 90-120 cm wide. Once winter is over, the leftover vegetables are taken out, and the ground is filled with earth again to keep it ready for the next harvest season. under the Sun \"In my village and across Ladakh, the technique of sun-drying vegetables and herbs has been around since ancient times, \" says Nilza Wangmo, chef and founder of Alchi Kitchen and recipient of the prestigious Nari Shakti Puraskar. The foraged herbs would be washed carefully and kept in the sun for a few hours until they were dry . Padma Yangchan, who was also awarded february 2023FINAL \"Lord bhair avnath is always around, keeping guard,\" is what the priests tell you when you visit the Kedarnath temple. After being buried under snow for about 400 years, saved from the torrential flash floods of 2013 by a massive boulder, and amidst a global climate crisis, Uttarakhand's Kedarnath temple is still standing unharmed and untouched by the fury of nature. An architectural marvel or the work of divine forces at play , the temple is a testimony to the beliefs of its most devout followers. The Mandakini river slithers below, and snowy peaks surround the temple, perched at 3,583 metres. Among the sacred four pilgrimage sites for Hindus, Kedarnath is also the most revered out of the 12 jyotirlingas. Extreme weather makes it inaccessible from November to April. PM Modi launched the Gaurikund to Kedarnath ropeway project in October 2022, which reduces travel time for commuters. But with ease of access comes inevitable ecological damage. \"It's important to train the local community about protecting their environs, \" said Pradeep Sangwan of the Healing Himalayas Foundation, a company that collects, stores, and recycles the waste generated on trekking routes in the "}
