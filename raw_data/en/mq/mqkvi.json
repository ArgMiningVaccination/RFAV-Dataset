The change became necessary after the Department of Energy, which runs a network of U.S. laboratories, obtained new intelligence that the virus did indeed come out of a lab. But the admission from Biden's Energy Department wasn't the only big development this week. There was also a far more important breakthrough that has not been reported at all. Researchers have found [evidence](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.12.528210v1.full.pdf) that the Wuhan lab was constructing viruses using the same techniques as seen in COVID-19 but resulting in far more dangerous pathogens. These experiments were hidden from the public and only came to light through some ingenious detective work. "}
