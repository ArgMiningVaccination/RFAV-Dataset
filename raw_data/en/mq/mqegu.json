Friday, January 15 5:30-8:30pm Saturday, January 16 10:30-3pm & 6-8pm This weekend retreat will explore how a clarity of meditation practice can frame our understanding of postural yoga practice, and how the yoga poses are themselves different contexts for meditation. This 2-day format is a precursor to longer programs that Fez and Ryan hope to hold through 2021. Retreat style practice has been an invaluable part of understanding the possibilities of yoga practice for well being, and as such, Fez and Ryan are seeking to offer this practice format to our Boston yoga community. This retreat format offers the added benefit of a focused retreat where one can simply commute to the practice space and then head home thereby, discovering how a period of concentrated practice can be directly applicable to daily life.
