Your Home Office Team Choose HO PE Your Choice. Everyone's Benefit. Wearing a mask and social distancing help reduce your chance of being exposed to COVID -19 or spreading it to others, but these measures are not enough. By choosing to get vaccina ted, you are choosing H.O.P.E. (Helping to Overcome the Pandemic for Everyone ). Your individual choice gives us the chance to end this pandemic, together. Below you will find answers from our clinical and HR Home Office team s to your questions about the COVID -19 vaccinations based on available information from health agencies (and is subject to change if new details are published) . We hope this information provides helpful references in making your choice to be vaccinated. Safety of the Vaccine: Is the vaccine really effective? The vaccines from both Pfizer and Moderna are showing 94 -95% efficacy in preventing COVID -19 during this trial phase. Which brand of the vaccine will we be getting? We will receive whichever CVS Pharmacy is administering at th e time of our clinics. Likely it will be the Pfizer vaccine since it was the first to be in mass circulation after being authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Can the vaccine give me the virus? (an d, what is in the vaccine?) None of the vaccines contains live or killed viral particles so there is no chance of getting the disease from the vaccines. On the contrary, the goal is to give your body the tools it needs to fight COVID -19 effectively and/o r prevent you from getting it at all. What are the side effects? Know that during the U.S. trials no significant safety concerns were identified. Short -term side effects are mild to moderate in severity. They may include fever, headaches and muscle aches and occur within the 1st three days of vaccination. This is because the 1st shot primes the immune system, helping it recognize the virus, and the 2nd shot strengthens the immune response. These side effects are normal and are signs your body is building up immunity. I am concerned the vaccine causes cancer. mRNA technology is being used in the vaccine development and already has been successfully us ed in cancer treatments. (continued) Prepared for our Co -workers Is there reason to be concerned about the speed at which the vaccine was developed? No steps are skipped in the safety evaluation process. The development of the vaccine was able to be accelerated due to: Emergency government funding availability to start vaccine production prior to trial completion; Experts around the world working together on the same problem in an unprecedented way never done before; Steps in the process happened simultaneously vs. sequentially. The COVID -19 vaccines are being held to the same safety standards as all vaccines. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices which is an independent body of qualified scientific and clinical experts review all the safety data before recommending use Is there a tracking chip in the vaccine? A video shared over thousands of times on Facebook makes false claims about the optional microchip that could be contai ned within the vaccine. The video alleges the microchip \"would give officials information on who has and has not been vaccinated\" and \"track the location of the patient.\" These claims are false. There is an optional identification chip that could be part o f the syringe's label which would allow the healthcare provider to confirm the vaccine has not expired. This technology is purely optional, and the U.S. government hasn't even decided if they're going to use it. Access to the Vaccine: Is Country Meadows and Ecumenical Retirement Community offering the vaccine to our staff and residents? Yes, plans for the roll -out at all of our campuses are underway. According to the government program, staff and residents of long -term care facilities are included in the 1st prioritized group. We have partnered with CVS through the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and are working with their local pharmacies to schedule our upcoming clinics. Both current staff and residents will have access to receive the vaccine through these campus clinics. Is all staff in every department eligible for the vaccine? Yes, all co -workers, including those in non -direct care positions, are considered healthcare professionals and qualify within this 1st prioritized group. Is Country Meadows/Ecu menical mandating staff to get vaccinated? Although we are not mandating the COVID -19 vaccine at this time , we know the higher the herd immunity level we create, the safer our communities will be for all who live and work there. We strongly encourage eve ry one of our co -workers to research and understand the benefits of helping to end this pandemic through vaccination. Will Country Meadows/Ecumenical require residents to get vaccinated? Like our staff, we will provide education and answer any questions they (or their families) have. However, we will not mandate the vaccination at this time. We hope both our staff and residents see this as a necessary alternative to the unfortunate number of seniors impacted during this pandemic. Their vaccination also w ill hasten the return to normalcy with family visits and socialization . (continued) Will Independent Living residents be included in these initial vaccination clinics? The information we have been receiving from the federal and state health agencies continues to evolve. The latest clarification from Pennsylvania and Maryland indicated Independent Living (IL) residents were not considered among long -term care residents. T hey designated IL residents in the 2nd priority round (1b) though did not provide vaccination timing for that group. However our hope is CVS Pharmacy is able to accept our complete campus list of residents to be included in the initial vaccination clinics. Because it is not our decision, at this point we can't definitively confirm. As soon as we receive more clear direction, we will inform our staff, residents and their families. Do I have to pay for the vaccine? The U.S. government is covering the cost o f the vaccine, but CVS will charge an administration fee for time and services of their staff providing the clinic. This will be charged to your health insurance. Country Meadows and Ecumenical Retirement Community will cover any expenses associated with o ur beneficiaries. I am a current co -worker and would like to get vaccinated \u2014what do I do? We are so glad to hear that \u2014thank you for doing your part to help protect yourself, your fellow team members and residents. We need you to participate in these upcoming clinics. Your campus team will contact you directly to complete a consent form issued f rom CVS prior to the clinics so they know exactly how many doses to bring. (NOTE: the Nursing Center has begun distributing the CVS consent form to residents and staff for the upcoming January 4 clinic.) (for our Nursing & Rehabilitation Center) When will 1st and 2nd doses be given at the Nursing Center? The cl inic for the 1st dose is Monday, January 4 and for the 2nd dose January 25. (for our Retirement Community campuses) When will 1st and 2nd doses be given at our retirement community campuses? We are unsure of the dates for th e 1st dose, but clinics likely will be in January at all retirement community campuses. Clinics for the 2nd dose will be hosted approximately 21 days after the initial clinic. CVS is still planning all dates based on their availability. But what if I can't make those clinic dates? Unfortunately these clinic dates are set by CVS without our control. At this time, these are the only dates available to receive the vaccination. The current vaccine is administered in two doses. It is necessary for you to participate in person at the campus clinics to receive both doses . Receiving only one of the two doses decreases the response, and you will not receive adequate coverage as intended. Will you stagger the vaccinatio ns among departments or shifts? No. Because our goal is to get as many co -workers and residents vaccinated in this initial round of clinics, we plan to include every departm ent and shift. We feel focusing on ensuring a successful clinic implementation by CVS takes higher priority over possible staff scheduling conflicts due to a vaccine reaction. (continued) Will those team members in closer contact with residents be prioritized? All staff members will be vaccinated at the same time at the upcoming clinics. Do I ne ed to get the vaccine annually/ do we know how long the effectiveness extends/if COVID is a \"morphing virus,\" then how do we know the vaccine is effective ? At this time, the health agencies have not indicated the necessary frequency of receiving this vaccine after the initial vaccination. Whatever ultimately is recommended, we plan to offer access to this vaccination for our staff and residents to our best ability . Human Resources Guidelines: Will I still have to wear a mask if I get the vaccine? Yes. Until enough of the population is vaccinated for us to feel confident there will not be transmission to those who are not vaccinated, we will continue wearing masks , our enhanced disinfection practices and equipment and testing where warranted and as directed by health authorities . If I get the vaccine and get sick from it, do I have to use my PTO? We w ill determine this on a case -by-case basis, but the Vice President of Operations team will have authority to grant PTO coverage for side effects from the vaccine , as warranted. If I do not get the vaccine and am exposed, will I get paid for my time off? We will keep the current adjusted Short Term Dis ability policy in place and re -assess it as the vaccine rolls out. Details Unique to You: Should I get the vaccine if I have other underlying conditions (allergies, chronic conditions)? We advise everyone to discuss the vaccine with their primary care phy sician if they are unsure of their individual risks. Should I get it if I just got my flu shot (how long to wait in between)? It is recommended to not get these two vaccines, or any vaccines , close together to as sure the best immune response. You should space these vaccines at least two -three weeks apart. We will suspend flu shot administration as of January 1 in anticipation of our COVID vaccine clinics . Should I get it if I already had COVID? I have antibodies. Although you should wait until th e active illness is over, studies have shown antibodies developed by the confirmed virus only last for 90 days. The vaccine is likely to last longer. Will there be an epi -pen on site if I have a reaction ? Yes. CVS is required to have epi -pens on site fo r all clinics. If you were to have an adverse reaction, it would occur within one hour of vaccination. Should I get it if I am pregnant/nursing/ trying to get pregnant? We recommend you consult with your primary care physician or OB/GYN for the best guidance.
