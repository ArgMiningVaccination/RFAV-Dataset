In addition to providing library services to residents, the Library also serves as a resource for the 1.7 million metropolitan residents of greater Kansas City. In 2004, the Kansas City Public Library - Central moved into the former First National Bank building at 10th and Baltimore in downtown Kansas City, Missouri. The century-old building, a true masterpiece of craftsmanship with its marble columns, bronze doors and ornate mouldings, required remodeling and a fifth floor addition, but provided the framework for a modern and impressive urban library . The location features state-of-the-art technology , improved and increased services, meeting rooms, a screening room, a coffee shop and much more, all within the walls of a building originally constructed to convey a sense of strength and continuity. It is upon that foundation the Library places its vision for the next century to come. Facts About the Library The Kansas City Public Library has ten locations.The Central Library is the largest facility, housing resources, special collections and administrative offices.More than 2,348,408 materials were checked out during the last fiscal year . The Inter Library Loan department loaned out 115,846 items last year to other libraries. 2,492,118 customers used the Library system last year.The Library system counts 1,147,278 items in its holdings. Helzberg Auditorium The Library's most versatile meeting space, the Helzberg Auditorium is located on the 5th floor of the library. Helzberg is also aggressively styled with contemporary and clean lines for an energetic atmosphere, and features performance quality acoustics using cork flooring and specially designed ceiling elements, built-in AV system, and floor-to-ceiling windows on multiple sides that provide natural lighting. Gladys Feld Helzberg Gladys Feld Helzberg was the wife of the late Barnett C. Helzberg, Sr, of Helzberg Diamonds. Helzberg jewelry store was founded in 1915 by the late Morris Helzberg, in Kansas City, Kan., and expanded to a regional market by Barnett C. Helzberg, Sr. Gladys was an active member of the Kansas City Chapter of the Association for Women in Communications and one of the founders of Veterans' Voices. The Gladys Feld Helzberg Scholarship Fund was established in 1960 for talented journalism students and is administered by the University of Kansas endowment fund. She was also the founder of the Greater Kansas City chapter of the Brandeis Women's Committee. 10David A. Haig, PhD George Putnam Professor of Biology Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Harvard University \"Early Zygotic Genome Activation, Genomic Imprinting, and Retroviruses. Why are Mammals Different?\" Keynote Lecture Speaker Information Dr. David Haig received his degrees from Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia. He was a Royal Society Endeavour Fellow at Oxford from 1990-1992, and then a Harvard Junior Fellow in the Society of Fellows from 1992-1995. In 1995, he joined the faculty as an Assistant Professor of Oranismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard, and has since risen through the ranks. He is now the George Putnam Professor of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. In 1994, Dr. Haig was awarded the Dobzhansky Prize from the Society for the Study of Evolution, and he became a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2010. Dr. Haig's main research interests are maternal-fetal relations and intragenomic conflict. In the area of maternal-fetal relations, he has applied Robert Trivers' theory of parent-offspring conflict to understanding the physiology of mammalian pregnancy. He has argued that some important medical complications of pregnancy, such as preeclampsia, are expressions of the conflicting evolutionary forces acting on genes of maternal and fetal origin. In the area of intragenomic conflict, he has explained the evolution of genomic imprinting in terms of an evolutionary conflict between genes of maternal and paternal origin that arises in interactions among relatives in social groups. 11Jon Hennebold, PhD Professor and Chief, Division of Reproductive and Developmental Sciences Oregon National Primate Research Center, Oregon Health and Science UniversityAdjunct Faculty, Departments of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Physiology & Pharmacology Oregon Health & Science University \"Defining the Intrafollicular Events Necessary for Primate Ovulation and Luteal Development\" Dr. Hennebold is the Professor and Chief of the Division of Reproductive & Developmental Sciences at the Oregon National Primate Research Center (ONPRC), which is located on the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) West Campus. He is also an adjunct faculty member in the Departments of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Physiology & Pharmacology at OHSU. Dr. Hennebold currently serves as the Director of the ONPRC Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) Core, which supports research activities involving nonhuman primate studies of reproductive biology. He received his Ph.D. in immunology and cell biology from the Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine in 1996. Dr. Hennebold then conducted his postdoctoral training in reproductive sciences at the University of Utah in the Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology. In 2000, he joined ONPRC as a Staff Scientist and was promoted to Assistant Scientist in 2003. Dr. Hennebold's research focus includes primate reproductive biology, specifically as related to ovarian physiology and processes required for fertilization and early embryonic development. Session I Kathleen M. Caron, PhD Professor and Chair, Department of Cell Biology and Physiology University of North Carolina School of Medicine \"Dosage Signals During Development: How Mother and Baby Communicate Before Birth\" Kathleen M. Caron, Ph.D. is a Professor and Chair in the Department of Cell Biology & Physiology in the School of Medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\u2014a large, interdisciplinary basic science department currently ranked 2nd in the nation in NIH funding. Prior to her role as Department Chair, Dr. Caron served as Assistant Dean for Research in the School of Medicine, where she and her colleagues launched a new Office of Research and a 5-year strategic plan. Dr. Caron graduated from Emory University with a BS in Biology and a BA in Philosophy. For her graduate work, she trained with Dr. Keith L. Parker in the Department of Cell Biology at Duke University where she elucidated the role of steroidogenesis in regulating sexual determination and adrenal and gonadal development using genetic mouse models. To gain more experience in gene targeting approaches, Dr. Caron pursued her postdoctoral training in the laboratory of Nobel Laureate Dr. Oliver Smithies at UNC-CH, where she was the first to discover the essential role of adrenomedullin peptide for embryonic survival. Her laboratory currently uses sophisticated gene targeting approaches to model human disease in mice. With a special emphasis on vascular biology, the Caron laboratory has gained valuable insights into the genetic basis and pathophysiology of lymphatic vascular disease, preeclampsia and sex-dependent cardiovascular disease. Dr. Caron has received numerous awards including a Burroughs Wellcome Fund Career Award in the Biomedical Sciences, an Established Investigator Award and an Innovator Award from the American Heart Association and a Jefferson Pilot Award in Biomedical Sciences. She currently serves as an Associate Editor for the prestigious Journal of Clinical Investigation and holds numerous scientific advisory roles in academia, industry and the National Institutes of Health, including serving as a founding member of the NICHD/NIAID Interdisciplinary Collaborative Team on Blastocyst Implantation. Dr. Caron is an accomplished teacher and mentor, having served as an advisor to over 35 graduate, post-graduate and clinical trainees. She is highly regarded for her impassioned drive for excellence and approach to individualized mentoring and career advising, as recognized by her participation in numerous symposia and articles related to professional development. 12Sarah Kimmins, PhD Associate Professor, Department of Reproductive Biology Associate Director, McGill Centre for the Study of Reproduction (CSR) McGill University \"The Role of the Sperm Epigenome in Offspring Health and Development\" Sarah Kimmins is appointed as an Associate Professor in the Department of Animal Science in the Faculty of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences at McGill University in Montr\u00e9al and is an Associate Member of the Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine at McGill. She received her PhD in Reproductive Biology from Dalhousie University in 2003. Her post-doctoral training in spermatogenesis and epigenetics was undertaken at the Universit\u00e9 Louis Pasteur, at the Institut de g\u00e9n\u00e9tique et de biologie mol\u00e9culaire et cellulaire in Strasbourg, France. In 2014 she received the American Society of Andrology's Young Andrologist Award and in 2016 the Young Investigator award from the Society for the Study of Reproduction.How memory of environmental exposures is transmitted from parents to children and even to great grandchildren to alter disease susceptibility and phenotype is mostly unknown. This phenomena, known as epigenetic inheritance was previously linked to variations in germline DNA methylation. The Kimmins research group and collaborators has recently identified new routes of epigenetic inheritance involving histone proteins and sperm-born RNA. Using a combination of mouse models and men from divergent populations and environmental contexts, her ongoing research is aimed at understanding how the lifestyle of parents can be recorded in the sperm to influence embryo development and the health of of fspring. Long-term goals are to to improve men's and child health by contributing to evidence-informed decisions for protecting and improving the pre-conception health of men and boys worldwide. Her research program is funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR). Deborah M. Sloboda, PhD Canada Research Chair in Perinatal Programming Associate Professor, Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences McMaster University \"Early Life Nutritional Impacts on Reproductive Development and Function: Developmental Programming in the Ovary\" Dr Sloboda holds a Canada Research Chair in Perinatal Programming and is an Associate Professor in the Dept of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences at McMaster University, Canada. She completed her PhD training at the University of Toronto, Dept of Physiology in 2001 following which she was a Postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Western Australia. In 2006 she was recruited to the Liggins Institute at the University of Auckland in New Zealand where in 2008 she was the Deputy Director of the National Research Centre for Growth and Development at the University of Auckland. In 2009 she held the position of Acting Director of the Centre for one year. In 2012, she left Auckland to take up a Faculty position at McMaster University. Dr Sloboda's laboratory investigates early life impacts on maternal, fetal and placental development and how this mediates the risk of non-communicable disease later in life. Her experimental studies investigate maternal nutrient manipulation on maternal pregnancy adaptations, placental gene expression and offspring reproductive development and maturation, and metabolic function. She was recently awarded the International Society of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease Nick Hales Award for outstanding research contribution to developmental programming, in 2015. Dr Sloboda is the Secretary of the International Society for the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease and is an Associate Editor for the Journal of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease. Dr Sloboda has published 87 papers in leading scientific journals and contributed to 12 books on the concept of early life origins of health and disease. Session II 13Donald F. Conrad, PhD Assistant Professor and Vice Chair for Research Department of Genetics and Pathology & ImmunologyWashington University \"The GEMINI Project: Identifying the Genetic Determinants of Human Sperm Production\" Don Conrad is a broadly trained human geneticist with 15 years of experience in developing statistical and experimental methods for genome analysis. As a graduate student at the University of Chicago, Don was a pioneer of genome-scale analysis of human copy number variation (CNV) with array technology. After obtaining his PhD in 2007, Don began a post-doctoral fellowship with Matthew Hurles at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. Some highlights of his post-doctoral work include production of the highest resolution array-based map of common copy number variation to date, and the first paper to describe the use of DNA capture arrays to sequence CNV breakpoints in a high-throughput fashion. In 2011 he started his own lab at Washington University, and currently serves as PI on three projects funded by the NIH. The first is an investigation of somatic mutation and CNV eQTLs within the GTEx project (www.gtex.org). The second is to continue development of DeNovoGear (https://github.com/denovogear/denovogear), a software package to detect de novo DNA mutations using sequencing data from related tissues and cells. The third is the GEMINI project, an international clinical consortium focusing on the genetics of male fertility. A primary goal of GEMINI is to develop exome sequencing as a useful tool for diagnosing male infertility. The Conrad lab is developing a wide range of statistical and experimental methods to improve the identification and validation of mutations identified by the GEMINI project. Alex Bortvin, MD, PhD Staff Member, Department of EmbryologyCarnegie Institution for Science \"Sex-Specific Strategies and Outcomes of Retro-transposon Control in Germ Cells of Mice\" Alex Bortvin is a Staff Member at the Department of Embryology, Carnegie Institution for Science that is located at the Homewood Campus of the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD. He is also an Adjunct Assistant Professor at the Department of Biology, JHU. He received his M.S. in Biochemistry and M.D. from Moscow Second Medical Institute (1989), and Ph.D. in Genetics from Harvard University (1997).

Maternal Hyperglycemia Pramod Dhakal, Damayanti Chakraborty and Michael J. Soares. Institute for Reproductive Health and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS Maternal hyperglycemia is paradoxically associated with intrauterine growth restriction, macrosomia and aberrant metabolic profiles in children, but the mechanisms mediating these deleterious ef fects are poorly understood. We investigated how maternal hyperglycemia influences placentation and fetal growth in a rat model because it exhibits deep intrauterine trophoblast invasion and extensive uterine spiral artery remodeling, events also characteristic of human placentation. Gestational hyperglycemia was induced by intravenous injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 45 mg/kg body weight; n = 16) on gestation day (gd) 6.5. Controls (n = 16) were injected with vehicle. On gd13.5 or gd18.5, similar litter sizes and numbers of viable placentas and fetuses were observed between treatment groups. On gd18.5, there was a significant reduction in fetal growth associated with a higher placental/fetal ratio among hyperglycemic dams compared to their euglycemic counterparts. Maternal hyperglycemia was further associated with aberrant expression of placental prolactin family proteins and spongiotrophoblast cell markers. We next, tested the impact of maternal hyperglycemia on placental adaptations to hypoxia, a robust test of plasticity at the maternal-fetal interface. All hyperglycemic pregnancies (n = 10) exposed to hypoxia (~10.5% oxygen) from gd6.5 to gd13.5, failed whereas all concurrently exposed euglycemic rats (n = 8), successfully adapted to hypoxia and maintained their pregnancies. The ontogeny of hypoxia-mediated dysfunction was investigated by examining placentation sites at gd9.5. Maternal hyperglycemia did not impact litter size or viability but it severely affected conceptus growth and was associated with an arrest in trophoblast expansion. In summary our observations reveal that maternal hyperglycemia adversely impacts placental structure and function, and compromises fetal growth. Furthermore, this disturbance in glucose homeostasis also undermines the ability of the placentation site to effectively adapt to environmental challenges, disrupting a critical attribute of a healthy placenta.

Trophoblast Cells Derived from Human Embryonic Stem Cells Express Integrin alpha1 in Response to High Oxygen. Rowan M. Karvas Ying Yang2, Toshi Sciences- University Missouri, 2Department of Animal Sciences, 3Department of Biochemistry, 4University of Missouri department of Ob/Gyn Human placentation is an invasive process that involves not only navigating the maternal decidua, but also invasion into the myometrium and remodeling of the spiral arteries by trophoblast. The efficiency of invasion by the trophoblast cells depends on their ability to change their adhesion proteins with each new layer of tissue invasion. One adhesion protein critical for the deepest invasion of the spiral arteries and myometrium is integrin alpha1 (ITGA1). ). ITGA1 is primarily a integrin and a marker of extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells, the most deeply invasive trophoblast cell type. Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy disease that is characterized by shallow invasion with reduced remodeling of the spiral arteries. Analysis of placental beds from women diagnosed with PE showed no upregulation of ITGA1- the reason for this is currently unknown. Our laboratory and others have developed a model of trophoblast differentiation from pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using BMP4 with ACTIVIN/NODAL and FGF2 signaling inhibitors (BAP treatment) that give rise to multiple trophoblast cell types exhibiting markers of cytotrophoblast, syncytiotrophoblast, and extravillous trophoblast. Treatment of hES cell line H1 with BAP for 6 days induced expression ofITGA1. There was a greater total fluorescence intensity of ITGA1 immunostaining in cells maintained at 20% than at 5% oxygen (2.8 + 0.55 x 10 5 vs. 1.1 + 0.18 x 105 20arbitrary units, p<0.04). Understanding the mechanism of oxygen-dependent upregulation of ITGA1 may aid in the understanding of one potential cause of the shallow invasion seen in PE. 3. Assessment of Differentially Expressed MicroRNAs in Bovine Large Offspring Syndrome. Yahan Li, Darren E. Hagen, Zhiyuan Chen, and Roc\u00edo Melissa Rivera. Division of Animal Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a loss-of-imprinting (LOI) human congenital overgrowth disease. The use of assisted reproductive therapies (ART) has been reported to increase the incidence of BWS. In ruminants, ART induces a similar fetal overgrowth condition called large offspring syndrome (LOS). LOS and BWS share phenotypes like macroglossia, macrosomia, and ear malformation. We have shown that LOS is a multi-locus LOI condition as is BWS. In addition, preliminary work demonstrates global misregulation of genes in LOS. microRNA (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs which regulate gene expression and are involved in many important biological processes such as development, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. miRNAs bind their target mRNAs through complementary sequences at their 3' untranslated region (UTR) and lead to translational repression or target mRNA degradation. Due to the involvement of miRNAs in regulation of gene expression, we hypothesize that there will be differences in miRNA expression between LOS and controls and that the transcripts they target will also be affected. We have identified FKBP4, HSPH1, KDM2A, MECP2, POLR3A, and SULT1A1 as transcripts often misregulated in LOS and have predicted candidate targeting miRNAs by extracting their 3' UTR sequence information from RefSeq and our transcriptome data. We used miRanda target prediction software with a stringent minimum score cutoff of 150 and maximum free energy of -20. We used the precomputed results from \"TargetScanHuman\" to corroborate our findings in bovine with those in human. We identified a miRNA (miR-671-5p) that potentially targets all mRNAs mentioned above, and hypothesized that its expression would be inversely associated with the potential targets' expression. To test this, total RNA was isolated from skeletal muscle, kidney, liver and placenta of day ~105 Bos taurus indicus x Bos taurus taurus F1 hybrid control and LOS fetuses. TaqMan Advanced miRNA cDNA Synthesis Kit and TaqMan Advanced (ThermoFisher) were used for cDNA synthesis and qRT-PCR. Preliminary findings in muscle suggest that this miRNA is downregulated in three of four LOS samples when compared to controls. In addition, there appears to be an inverse association with the transcript amount of FKBP4 and HSPH1 and miR-671-5p. 4. Effect of Diet on Ability of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A (VEGFA) Isoforms to Alter Follicular Progression in Bovine Ovarian Cortical Cultures. Mohamed A. Abedal-Majed 1, Manjula Magamage2, Rebecca Vinton1, Scott Kurz,1 Anthony K. Harvey C. Freetly3, Robert A Cushman3, Jennifer R. Wood1, Andrea S. Cupp1* Department of Animal Science, 1 University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, Nebraska, Department of Livestock Production 2, Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka, USDA, ARS, U.S. Meat Animal Research Center, Clay Center3, NE 68933 The objective of this study was to determine the effect of changes in diet on ability of VEGFA isoforms to alter follicle progression in bovine ovarian cortex cultures. Heifers (n = 30) received Control diet (30% alfalfa hay, 69.8% corn silage, 0.2% salt) before 6 heifers were ovariectomized at 8 months of age (collection 1). The remaining 24 heifers were divided into 2 treatment groups and offered different diets: Controls (228 Kcal ME/BW Kg 0.75) or Stair-Step (157 Kcal ME/BW Kg 0.75) and six heifers were ovariectomized from each group (collection 2) after 84 days. Diets were then administered to increase Stair-Step (277 Kcal ME/BW Kg 0.75) and maintain control diet (228 Kcal ME/BW Kg 0.75) heifers for 63 days until ovariectomy (collection 3). At each ovariectomy, ovarian cortical strip pieces were collected for RNA and cultured for 7 days in Waymouth's medium supplemented with antibiotics, ITS and BSA and treated with 50 ng/ml of angiogenic VEGFA165, antiangiogenic VEGFA165b, a combination of VEGFA165 and VEGFA165b; or PBS. After 7 days of culture, the cortical strips were fixed and embedded in paraffin and 4-5 5m sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for follicle staging. Follicle stages were analyzed by three different technicians. In collection 3, VE-cadherin and Nrp-1 mRNA were increased in Stair-Step heifers (P < 0.05). There were no interactions of in vitro VEGFA isoform treatments with in vivo diets at any collection time. However, VEGFA165 increased follicular progression to later stages of development and VEGFA165b inhibited the action of VEGFA165 overall. In histological sections, Stair-Step heifers had less primordial follicles (P = 0.01) at collection 2 while 21at collection 3, they had more primordial follicles (P = 0.001) than Control heifers. Thus, we can conclude from these results that VEGFA isoform, VEGFA165, can stimulate follicle progression independent of diet. These bovine cortical cultures are an excellent model to understand the mechanisms of VEGFA isoforms on follicle progression in vitro. USDA is an equal opportunity provider and employer. 5. Development of Novel Mouse Models Using Genome Editing Approaches. Illya Bronshteyn, Jennifer Pace, Julia Draper, Jay L. Vivian, and Melissa A. Larson. Transgenic and Gene Targeting Institutional Facility. University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS. Genetic manipulation of the mouse has become a standard and indispensable tool for investigating gene function in vivo and for the development of animal models of human disease. Although the use of genetically modified mice is widespread in the biomedical research community, including KUMC, the techniques employed for the generation of these models require specialized equipment and technical expertise. The KUMC Transgenic and Gene Targeting Institutional Facility is an institutional support facility providing a centralized service for the production of transgenic and gene-targeted mice, and related services. By centralizing operations into the Transgenic and Gene-Targeting Facility, the gene-modified mouse is available as a research tool to all investigators of research universities in Kansas and the surrounding Kansas City research community. The Facility uses cutting edge methods, state-of-the-art instrumentation, and novel reagents for this work. Our services include microinjection services by pronuclear injection of DNA and blastocyst injection of embryonic stem cells. The Facility is also actively employing new transgenic technologies to enhance the rapid development of novel mouse models. Initiatives under development include induced pluripotent stem cells in the mouse and human. In addition, our Facility has successfully used genome editing for in vivo mutagenesis and gene targeting in the mouse via site specific nucleases (zinc finger nucleases, Cas9 system, TALENs). We also have active studies examining the potential of site specific integrases (e.g. PhiC31 integrase) for gene targeting of transgenes in vivo. In this poster we will present recent mouse models developed by the TGIF using genome editing approaches. 6. Obesity Induces Hyperinsulinemia Endotoxemia and Alters Ovarian Phosphatidylinositol-3 Kinase Signaling a Porcine Model. Katie L. Bidne 1, Jackson Nteeba1, R. Scott Rector2,3, Jim W. Perfield II2,4, Chad H. Stahl5, Aileen F. Keating1 1 Department of Animal Science, Iowa State University. 2 Department of Nutrition and Exercise Physiology and Medicine, University of Missouri 3 Harry S Truman Memorial VA Hospital, Columbia, MO 4 Current Address: Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Co. 5 Department of Animal and Avian Sciences, University of Maryland Hyperinsulinemia and metabolic endotoxemia are phenotypic observations in obese females. While non- ovarian tissues become insulin resistant, the ovary remains insulin sensitive. We have demonstrated that progressive obesity in mice modifies ovarian insulin, steroidogenic and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway signaling. Insulin binds to the insulin receptor (INSR), causing recruitment of proteins in the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) family. Defects in IRS1 and IRS2 cause reproductive dysfunction while insulin promotes primordial follicle activation. PI3K activation, via IRS, recruits and phosphorylates AKT (pAKT), thereby regulating follicular activation, recruitment, and survival. Metabolic endotoxemia characterized by elevated circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS) results from disrupted intestinal integrity. LPS is a ligand for toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), initiating a signaling cascade that results in nuclear factor-kappa B (NF- B) phosphorylation and activation. We hypothesized that hyperinsulinemia and metabolic endotoxemia alter basal ovarian physiology contributing to infertility associated with obesity. Female Ossabaw gilts were limit fed (LF; n = 6) or fed an obesogenic diet (OF; n = 6) from weaning until approximately 20 weeks of age. Body weight was recorded and blood collected for LPS and insulin measurement. Ovaries were collected post-euthanasia (AKT and CYP19A1) quantification. Body weight, circulating LPS and insulin were increased (P < 0.05) in the OF gilts. Increased ( P < 0.05) cKIT, AKT1, LDLR and LHR were observed in OF females. OF gilts had reduced (P < 0.05) ovarian STAR, CYP11A1 and HSD3B1 while a trend for increased ( P < 0.1) CYP17A1 mRNA was observed. While no impact of OF on mRNA encoding CYP19A1 was noted, CYP19A1 protein was reduced ( P < 0.05) in OF females. Taken together, these data add mechanistic information on ovarian alterations that potentially contribute to infertility in an obese pig model.

Iqbal, Pramod Dhakal, Damayanti Chakraborty Michael J. Soares. Institute for Reproductive Health and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS. Interleukin 33 (IL33) is a novel member of the IL1 family. IL33 is expressed in epithelial cells and possesses a barrier function and also contributes to Th2 type immune responses and innate immunity. Roles of IL33 in the female reproductive tract are poorly understood. In the present study, we explore the biology of IL33 in the female reproductive tract. Initially, we examined the regulation of IL33 expression in the female reproductive tract. The acute effects of ovarian steroid hormones on Il33 expression in the uterus were investigated using ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Treatment with progesterone significantly increased Il33 expression, whereas the treatment with estrogen significantly decreased Il33 expression. Next, we examined whether IL33 is associated with decidualization, a progesterone-dependent event. We treated OVX rats with an empirically determined hormone regimen, including both estrogen and progesterone, known to prepare the uterus for embryo implantation. Decidualization was induced by scratching the antimesometrial endometrial surface of one uterine horn. In contrast to the acute actions of progesterone on the uterus of the OVX rat, decidualization was associated with a significant decrease in Il33 expression. Il33 expression was also examined in the midgestation placentation site. We observed that Il33 expression was significantly higher in the metrial gland than in the junctional and labyrinth zones of the gestation day 13.5 placentation site. To explore the role of IL33 in female reproductive function, we generated a Il33 mutant rat model using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)-mediated genome editing. Founders were backcrossed to wild-type rats and the genotypes of offspring analyzed. Il33 mutations were successfully transmitted through the germline and led to a loss of IL33 protein and a null mutation. In summary, IL33 is a potential contributor to the regulation of female reproductive function. Future work will be directed toward identifying a role for IL33 in female reproductive function, including the establishment of pregnancy using an IL33 deficient rat model.

Alejandro 1 Department of Cancer Biology, 2 Department of Pharmacology, Toxicology and Therapeutics, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, 3 High Throughput Screening Laboratory, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA. Missense mutations in the p53 gene result in accumulation of dysfunctional p53 proteins in tumors with oncogenic gain-of-function activities, such as stemness, metastasis and chemotherapy resistance. Increasing evidence indicates that stabilization of mutant p53 (mutp53) inhibits stem-like properties of cancer cells and is crucial for its oncogenic activities in tumors, while its knockdown reduces malignant progression. Thus, malignant properties of cancer cells are dependent on the presence of mutp53, providing a rationale to identify compounds that deplete mutp53 with minimal effects on wild-type p53 (wtp53). Toward this goal, we performed luciferase assay-based high-throughput screening of ~9,000 chemical compounds using cells expressing a chimeric fusion protein of p53R175H and a luciferase reporter. This screening led us to identify \"statins\", a class of cholesterol-lowering drugs, as degradation inducers of conformational p53 mutants. Interestingly, statins showed minimal effects on wtp53 and DNA contact mutants. Moreover, CHIP ubiquitin ligase, but not MDM2, mediated statin-induced nuclear export, ubiquitination, and degradation of mutp53. Surprisingly, degradation of mutp53 by statins was independent of protein prenylation/lipidation or cholesterol synthesis, and specific reduction of mevalonte-5-phosphate (MVP) triggered mutp53 degradation. W e also demonstrated that downregulation of a molecular chaperone Hsp40/DNAJA1 mirrored statin's effects on mutp53, while its overexpression nullified them. Moreover, statin-induced reduction of MVP inhibited the DNAJA1-mutp53 interaction. Biologically, statins preferentially suppressed malignant properties of mutp53-expressing cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Our study proposes a novel role of DNAJA1 in inhibiting CHIP-mediated degradation of mutp53 induced by statins and highlights the significance of p53 status in impacting the efficacy of statins in cancer therapy and of DNAJA1 as a viable target for inducing mutp53 degradation. 239. SATB1 Promotion of Trophoblast Stem Cell Renewal Dehydro - genase. Kaiyu Kubota, M.A.Karim Rumi and Michael J. Soares. Institute for Reproductive Health and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS. Trophoblast stem (TS) cell renewal and differentiation are essential processes in placentation. We have identified a chromatin organizer/transcription factor called special AT -rich binding protein 1 (SATB1) as a key regulator in the maintenance of TS cell renewal. The mechanism of SATB1 action in TS cells is unknown. In this study, we have investigated SATB1 downstream targets. RNA-seq analysis was performed in Rcho-1 TS cells expressing control or Satb1 shRNAs in order to identify candidate SATB1 targets. Disruption of SATB1 expression had a profound effect on Rcho-1 TS cell gene expression, resulting in the downregulation of 339 transcripts (>1.5 fold) and upregulation of 618 transcripts (>1.5 fold). Among the differentially-regulated tran - scripts, were downregulated transcripts known to affect cell Cdx2, the conversion of threonine into glycine and acetyl-CoA and has been reported to regulate pluripotency in embry - onic stem cells. This prompted an evaluation of TDH in TS cells. Tdh expression was high in the stem state and decreased as trophoblast cells differentiated. Treatment of Rcho-1 TS cells with a TDH inhibitor (Qc1, Millipore) cell proliferation in manner. TDH inhibitor treatment also attenuated stem state-associated transcripts and elevated differentiation-association transcripts. The mechanism of TDH regulation of TS cell stem state was explored. TDH inhibitor treated Rcho-1 cells exhibited a dysregulated his - tone H3K9 methylome. The involvement of TDH on ex vivo blastocyst outgrowth was further investigated. TDH inhibitor treatment decreased TS cell colony size , blastocyst outgrowth, and stem state-associated transcripts. Our findings suggest that the actions of SATB1 on TS cell maintenance may be mediated, at least in part, through the regulation of TDH. (Supported by NIH grants: HD020676 and HD079363) 10. Maternal Obesity is Correlated with Altered Muscle Progenitor Differentiation in Mid-gestation Embryos and Neonatal Offspring. Andrea R. McCain, Kristin A. Beede, Dustin T. Yates, and Jennifer R. Wood. Department of Animal Science, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Maternal obesity alters fetal development due to potential changes in lipid and proinflammatory cytokine exposure and/or altered placental nutrient delivery or hormone synthesis, which may increase the likelihood of obesity and metabolic syndrome in the offspring. Thus, the objective of the current study was to determine if maternal obesity alters gene expression in skeletal muscle progenitor cells indicative of altered fiber development. To attain this goal, we utilized the Lethal Yellow (LY) mouse, which is characterized by an obesogenic, prediabetic phenotype as a result of a natural deletion mutation leading to overexpression of agouti and decreased satiety. Embryos collected from LY dams on embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) showed decreased embryonic weight (P<0.001) and decreased number of tail somites (P<0.001) compared to E12.5 embryos collected from lean C57BL/6 (B6) controls. Furthermore, immunofluorescence showed a two-fold increase in fluorescence intensity of desmin (P<0.08), an intermediate filament of mature muscle fibers, in the somite region of mid-gestation embryos from LY vs. B6 dams. The expression of Pax7 and Myogenin, which are markers of muscle progenitor cells and differentiating fibers, respectively were also measured in hindlimb muscle of postnatal day 5 offspring of LY and B6 dams. These immunofluorescence experiments indicated a depletion of progenitor cells in the muscle of LY-derived neonates. Decreased placental weight (P<0.001) and decreased embryo/placenta weight ratio (P<0.05) were additional phenotypes of LY dams. Furthermore, the mRNA abundance of 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD11B2) was decreased in placenta from LY dams. These data suggest inefficient transport of nutrients by the placenta and increased exposure of LY-derived fetuses and neonates to active glucocorticoids. Collectively, these data suggest premature depletion of muscle progenitors and a potential difference in the metabolic function of the skeletal muscle in offspring of obese females which may predispose the offspring to the development of metabolic syndrome. 2411. Extracellular Vesicles Originate from the Conceptus and Uterus During Early Pregnancy in Sheep. Gregory W. Burns, Kelsey E. Brooks, and Thomas E. Spencer. Division of Animal Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO. Cells release diverse types of membrane-bound vesicles of endosomal and plasma membrane origin termed exosomes and microvesicles, respectively. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) represent an important mode of intercellular communication by transferring select RNAs, proteins, and lipids between cells. The present studies tested the hypothesis that the ovine conceptus and uterus produces EVs that mediate conceptus-maternal interactions during early pregnancy. In Study One, EVs were purified from uterine luminal fluid (ULF) of day 14 cyclic ewes using ExoQuick-TC precipitation solution. As determined by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), the uterine lumen of day 14 cyclic ewes contained a total of 1.12x10 11 particles with an average diameter of 160 nm. Next, control liposomes or fluorescently labeled day 14 cyclic ULF EVs were infused into the uterine lumen of sheep from days 8 to 14 post-mating using an osmotic pump. Labeled EVs were observed in the conceptus trophectoderm, uterine luminal epithelium (LE) and superficial glandular epithelium (sGE), but not in the GE, stroma or myometrium of the uterus. In Study Two, day 14 conceptuses were cultured ex vivo for 24 hours and EVs in the culture medium isolated and quantified by NT A. Conceptus-derived EVs averaged 150 nm in diameter and the culture medium contained an average of 5.8x10 9 particles. Fluorescently labeled conceptus-derived EVs were infused into the lumen of one uterine horn of cyclic ewes from days 8 to 14 post-estrus using an osmotic pump. Labeled EVs were observed in the LE and sGE of the ipsilateral uterine horn, but not in the deeper GE, stroma or myometrium nor any cells in the contralateral uterine horn. Confocal microscopy revealed that conceptus-derived EVs were clearly present within the cell borders of the LE as evidenced by maximum projection images overlaid with differential interference contrast (DIC) images. These studies support the ideas that EVs emanate from both the conceptus trophectoderm and uterine epithelia during early pregnancy and are novel mediators of intercellular communication between those cells during the establishment of pregnancy.

Altered Expression of Mitochondria and Heterochromatin Associated Transcripts in Egg and Follicle Cells of Aged Drosophila Melanogaster Females. Alexandra Erwin and Justin Blumenstiel, University of Kansas Epigenetic changes have been associated with the aging soma, but little is known about epigenetic changes in the germline and other reproductive tissues during aging. We analyzed RNA-seq data from aged stage 14 egg chambers from D. melanogaster females. Stage 14 represents the last stage of oogenesis before fertilization and oviposition. By focusing on this stage of development, we can investigate how aging jointly effects both the soma (follicle cells) and germline (oocyte) of developing eggs. In addition, our use of two isogenic lines from a single wild type population allows us to distinguish between strain-specific versus more general age af fects. We find that both germline and somatic transcripts are altered across age in both strains. Most notably, transcripts of the mitochondrial genome as well as nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial organization and oxidation processes have altered transcription in eggs of aged mothers. W e also find enrichment of differentially expressed genes on the heterochromatic 4th chromosome of D. melanogaster . Numerous studies have shown transposable element (TE) de-repression in the aging soma, thought to be a result of heterochromatin redistribution. We asked if this de-repression of TEs also occurs in aged reproductive tissues. We found one retrovirus-like element, copia , that increased during aging in both Drosophila melanogaster lines that we analyzed. There were several other TEs that showed an age effect on expression, but only in one strain. Additionally, these TEs showed a decrease in aging as opposed to the age-induced increased expression found in other studies. Thus, global TE de-repression in aging tissue may be exclusive to the soma and depend on both the genetic background and the TE family. 2513. Atypical Protein Kinase C Iota (PKC ) of and Laboratory Medicine, Institute for Reproductive Health and Regenerative Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center Miscarriage causes termination of 15-20% of implantation-confirmed pregnancies. About 85% of miscarriages occur during the first trimester of pregnancy and defective placentation is considered as one of the major causes for pregnancy failure. However, molecular mechanisms behind defective placentation during early post-implantation development are poorly understood. Atypical PKC isoform, PKC , is essential for post-implantation mammalian development. Gene knockout studies in mice showed that loss of Prkci gene, which encodes PKC, results in defective gastrulation leading to embryonic lethality prior to embryonic day (E) 9.5. However, PKC signaling in trophoblast stem and progenitor cells and its importance in the context of mammalian development has never been studied. In this study, we show that placental development is impaired in Prkci -/- mouse embryos. Interestingly, rescue of PKC-function in the embryo proper does not rescue embryonic lethality, indicating that trophoblast-lineage specific PKC function is essential for progression of post-implantation mammalian development. PKC is predominantly expressed in the trophoblast stem and progenitor cells during early stages of mouse and human placentation. Our mechanistic analyses with PKC -depleted mouse trophoblast stem cells reveal that PKC is essential to establish the trophoblast stem state-specific gene expression program and to maintain epithelial nature. Our study discovers that trophoblast-specific PKC function is essential for successful progression of pregnancy. We propose that defective PKC function could be a cause for miscarriage. 14. Inhibition of Germinal Vesicle Breakdown Using IBMX Increases Abundance of MicroRNA-21 in the Porcine Oocyte. Benjamin J. Hale and J.W. Ross. Department of Animal Science, Iowa State University After germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) during oocyte meiotic maturation, transcriptional processes are virtually inactive and do not resume until activation of the zygotic genome. As a result, the maturing oocyte is reliant on post-transcriptional gene regulation (PTGR) and/or interactions with the surrounding cumulus cells to regulate the mRNA repertoire and proteome prior to fertilization. MicroRNA (miRNA), a class of functional small RNA, interact with the mRNA 3 untranslated region (UTR) to affect mRNA abundance and translational efficiency. Of particular importance is miRNA-21 (MIR21) due to its role in regulating programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), and ultimately inhibiting apoptosis. We have previously demonstrated an elevated abundance of MIR21 in metaphase II-arrested (MII) oocytes vesicle (GV), and that inhibiting MIR21 during oocyte maturation prevents PDCD4 degradation compared to control oocytes. The objective of this project was to characterize the abundance and regulation of MIR21 in relation to GVBD in the oocyte during in vitro maturation (IVM). GV stage oocytes were aspirated from 3 to 4 mm follicles and selected for IVM for 42 h. Relative abundance of mature MIR21 was quantified using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) at 0, 8, 16, 24, 32, and 42 h of IVM with or without treatment with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), a competitive nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor that prevents oocytes. Culture with IBMX increased abundance of MIR21 at 24 h approximately 6-fold compared to control ( P < 0.05). To test whether if IBMX induced MIR21 is functional, western blotting was done to detect relative changes in PDCD4 abundance at 0, 24, and 42 h of IVM with or without IBMX treatment. IBMX induced increases in MIR21 abun - dance at 24 h of IVM was concomitant with premature depletion of PDCD4 protein abundance. Additionally, phosphorylated NF-B, a potential regulator of MIR21, was increased in oocytes that underwent IVM in the presence of IBMX, compared to control oocytes after 24 h ( P < 0.05). These data suggest NF-B is a poten- tial contributor to PDCD4 protein downregulation induction of MIR21 prior to GVBD. 2615. Composition and Regulation of Lipid Droplets in Bovine Lutea . Heather A. Lagundzin5, Nicholas T. Woods5 and John S. Davis1,2,6 1) Olson Center for Women's Health (Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology), 2) Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 3) Department of Surgery 4) Department of Pediatrics, 5) Eppley Institute University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE; 6) VA Nebraska-Western Iowa Health Care System, Omaha, NE Establishment and maintenance of pregnancy is dependent on the ability of the ovarian corpus luteum (CL) to synthesize progesterone. The ovulatory surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) prompts development of the CL and differentiation of the follicular cells. During differentiation, there is an increase in expression of steroidogenic enzymes, proteins that transport cholesterol, and lipid droplet (LD)-associated proteins important for storing cholesterol esters (CE). Our purpose was to identify the composition and regulation of LDs in ovarian steroidogenic cells. We hypothesized that LDs serve as a site of cholesterol mobilization in response to LH. Bovine ovaries with functional CLs were used for whole tissue analysis and centrifugal elutriation isolation of small and large luteal cells. LDs were isolated by a step-wise sucrose gradient for subsequent lipid and protein analyses. The neutral core of luteal LDs was composed primarily of triglyceride (TAG) (168 pmol/g protein), diglyceride (5.62 pmol/ g protein) and CE (2.78 pmol/ g protein). Compared to adipocyte LDs, bovine luteal LDs were enriched in CE, and nearly all CE present in the CL tissue were present in the LD fraction. In vitro differentiation of follicular cells to luteal cell types was accompanied by increases in neutral lipids, formation of LDs, and expression of the LD coat protein PLIN2 and hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), an enzyme that hydrolyzes CE to release cholesterol. Luteal LD-associated proteins were determined by proteomics and/or Western protein activator 8-Br-cAMP increased the phosphorylation of HSL stimulated synthesis (5-fold, P<0.01), StAR (14-fold) and (20-fold) (P<0.01). Treatment with an CAY10499, significantly inhibited LH-stimulated progesterone synthesis ( P<0.05). The results indicate that bovine luteal LDs are not similar to LDs isolated from adipose tissue and contain deposits of CE, although TAGs are still the predominant lipid species. Association of activated HSL, StAR, 3HSD, and p450scc with luteal LDs suggests that LDs are an active platform for the steroidogenic machinery in the CL. Supported by: USDA, Olson Center, and VA. 16. Loss of CITED2 Causes Placental Defects and Neonatal Mortality. Pramod Dhakal, Khursheed Iqbal, Jackson Nteeba, and Michael J. Soares. Institute for Reproductive Health and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS CITED2 is a transcriptional co-regulator that modulates access transcription factors to an epigenetic modulator, Cbp/p300. CITED2 is widely expressed in embryonic and extraembryonic tissues, and has been implicated in the regulation of embryonic and placental development. The rat has proven to be an effective model for investigating hemochorial placentation associated with deep intrauterine trophoblast invasion, as also observed in the human. Cited2 expression progressively increases during trophoblast differentiation and was restricted to the junctional zone of the chorioallantoic placenta and intrauterine invasive trophoblast cells. A global Cited2 null rat possessing a 1477 bp deletion encompassing the entire Cited2 coding region was generated using Crispr/Cas9 genome editing. Cited2 mutations were successfully transmitted through the germline. Cited2 null placentas and fetuses were viable throughout gestation. Pups died within a few hours of birth with signs of respiratory failure and deficits in lung maturation. Both junctional and labyrinth zones of the placenta exhibited growth restriction in the Cited2 nulls. At gestation day 13.5, Cited2 null placentation sites exhibited reduced intrauterine invasion, which was ameliorated by exposure of the pregnant female to hypoxia (10.5% oxygen). RNA sequencing of junctional zone tissues (source of invasive trophoblast progenitors) revealed prominent transcript dysregulation associated with Cited2 disruption. Pathways associated with angiogenesis and cell adhesion were inhibited. In first trimester human placenta, CITED2 was prominently expressed in extravillous trophoblast columns, analogous to the junctional zone of the rat placenta. These insights and new tools place us in an advantageous position to elucidate roles for CITED2 in the regulation of trophoblast development. The parallels between rat and human placental CITED2 expression patterns are remarkable and suggest conserved roles in regulating the development of invasive trophoblast lineages and their efforts in restructuring the uterus into a nurturing site for the growing fetus.

Prabhakar Singh1, Min Luo2, Anamika Ratri1, Wolfe2, M.A. Karim Rumi1 1Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, 2Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, 3Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Institute for Reproductive Health and Regenerative Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS. Estrogens play an important role in regulating various physiological functions. Two nuclear receptors, estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and estrogen receptor 2 (ESR2), and a G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPR30), mediate the responses to estrogens. ESR1 and ESR2 act as transcription factors and bind to estrogen response elements (ERE) to regulate gene expression. These nuclear receptors can also modulate gene expression through non-ERE pathways by interacting with other transcriptional factors or activating protein kinases. Both ESR1 and ESR2 have unique as well as certain overlapping expression patterns in the brain, however, ESR2 has been shown to have non-reproductive neurological functions. ESR2 knockout mouse models exhibit deficits in cognitive function, and abnormal social behavior . In this study, we have utilized two mutant rat models, one with a null mutation (E3) and the other with a targeted in-frame deletion of the DNA binding domain (DBD; E4) to explore ESR2 function in the brain. The E4 mutant ESR2 protein lacks ERE- dependent transcriptional activity while E3 rats completely lack ESR2 protein. W e analyzed brain functions in aged female rats ( 12 months; n9 in each group) through a series of behavioral tests including open field (locomotor and exploration), elevated plus maze (anxiety), elevated platform (anxiety) and Y-maze (spatial working memory). In the elevated plus maze test, we found that E3 mutant rats, but not the E4 mutants, spent a significantly longer time and total distance travelled in the open arm than the wild type rats (p<0.05). E3 mutant rats also spent a significantly longer time in the outer zone during open platform test exhibiting a decreased anxiety-like behavior (p<0.05). Such altered behavioral response in ESR2 null mutants (E3) but not in the E4 DBD mutants (similar to wild type), indicates the importance of non-ERE pathways in regulation of anxiety-like behavior. 18. Biological Roles of Uterine Glands and Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) During Early Pregnancy in Mice. Andrew M Kelleher and Thomas E Spencer. Division of Animal Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia Uterine glands and their secretions are essential for blastocyst implantation and thus early pregnancy success in mice and likely humans. In mice, the uterus becomes receptive to blastocyst implantation on gestational day (GD) 4 and, by the afternoon of GD 5, becomes refractory. Leukemia inhibitory factor ( Lif) is expressed in the glandular epithelium (GE) on GD 4 in response to ovarian estrogen, and Lif null mice are infertile due to defects in blastocyst implantation . Studies of Lif null, Foxa2 conditional mutant Pgr creFoxa2 cKO), and progesterone-induced uterine gland knockout (PUGKO) mice support the hypothesis that uterine glands and, by inference, their secretions have important biological roles in early pregnancy events. Proteomic profiling by mass spectrometry of the uterine luminal fluid from day of pseudopregnancy 3, 4 and 5 of Control and PUGKO mice identified 1,359 proteins. Of note, no known GE expressed and secreted proteins, including LIF and SPINK3, were observed in the ULF, suggesting they are secreted in a basolateral manner. Next, Control, Pgr cre Foxa2 Lactoferrin-iCre (LTFicre) Foxa2 cKO, and received intraperitoneal injections of either mouse serum albumin (MSA) or LIF (10 \u00b5(10 PUGKO mice injections of either mousPgrcre Foxa2 cKO, LTFicre Foxa2 cKO, and PUGKO mice injected with MSA had no implantation sites (0 IS), whereas implantation occurred in LIF-injected Control (8.2 IS), Pgrcre Foxa2 cKO (7.8 IS), LTFicre Foxa2 cKO (8.4 IS) and PUGKO (7.2 IS) mice. On GD 9.5, IS number was substantially reduced in LIF-injected PgrcreFoxa2 cKO (0 IS) and PUGKO mice (0.8 IS) compared to Control mice (8.0 IS). The IS observed on GD 9.5 LIF-injected PUGKO mice contained growth retarded embryos with a regressing decidua. In contrast, LTF icre Foxa2 cKO mice, which retain uterine glands, contain histologically normal implantation sites on GD 9.5 following LIF injection. Collectively, these studies support the ideas that uterine glands are required for pregnancy because they secrete: (1) LIF in a basolateral manner to elicit blastocyst implantation; and (2) other undefined factors that regulate stromal cell decidualization and placentation Aromatase Inhibition during Bovine Dominant Follicle Development Delays Ovulation But Does Not Create a Persistent Follicle. Sarah Romereim1, Sarah Tenley1, Mohamed A. Abedal-Majed1, Jeffrey Bergman1, Scott Kurz1, S. Cupp1 1University of Nebraska- Lincoln; 2University of Nebraska Medical Center Persistent follicles that do not undergo atresia or ovulate on the typical timeframe are often precursors to follicular cysts, a condition that negatively impacts the fertility and health of both women and cattle. Within the UNL Physiology beef cattle herd, cows with naturally occurring sporadic anovulation and persistent dominant follicles have been identified. These follicles have a very high androstenedione-to-estrogen ratio compared to control cows. In a pilot trial using the aromatase inhibitor Letrozole, we assessed the ability of this treatment to mimic the sporadic anovulation conditions by artificially skewing the androgen-to-estrogen ratio. Follicular development was tracked with transrectal ultrasonography during a one-month estrous synchronization period to ensure that the cows were ovulatory. Three cows were then injected with 250 g/kg Letrozole daily for six days during the predicted period of dominant follicle growth. Three control cows were injected with vehicle only. Daily plasma concentrations of estradiol, androstenedione, progesterone, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), and non-esterified fatty acids were determined. There was variability in the response of the cows to the Letrozole treatment. One cow did not experience a delay in ovulation (21 days vs. the control average 23.7), one had a minor delay (3 days > the control average), and one cow showed an extended delay (>32 days, no ovulation seen during experimental period) accompanied by a longer suppression of plasma estradiol concentrations. SHBG concentrations were not affected by the treatment, though the one cow that did not respond well to the Letrozole had very high (>60 nM) circulating SHBG just prior to the injection period. The two cows with delayed ovulation had extended peak progesterone production and delayed luteolysis, indicating that the mechanism underlying the delayed ovulation was inhibition of the LH surge. However, none of the treated cows developed persistent follicles. Instead, the dominant follicle during treatment underwent atresia, and a third follicular wave occurred. Thus, this pilot trial did not reproduce the sporadic anovulatory conditions present within our research herd; however, this study provides detailed information on the effects of Letrozole on follicular growth and maturation that was previously not available in the literature. 20. Histone Variant H2A.Z Exchange at Sites of Double Strand Breaks H3K79 K. Christenson2,3, Patrick E. Fields1,3 1 Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Kansas City KS, 66160, 2 Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, Kansas City, KS 66160, 3 Institute for Reproductive Health and Regenerative Medicine, Kansas City KS, 66160 In the presence of DNA damage the usage of DNA repair pathways maintains genome integrity. In eukaryotic cells, the Homologous recombination (HR) and Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathways are required for the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). The utilization of HR or NHEJ at the sites of DSBs is influenced by the local chromatin state. In mammals, histone modification and histone variant exchange at DSB sites generate an open chromatin state necessary for DSB repair to take place. How histone modifications contribute to histone variant exchange at DSB sites and how this processes contributes to DNA repair remains an important issue. In eukaryotes, phosphorylation of the histone variant H2A.X is an early histone modification that contributes to sensing DSBs. The propagation of the y-H2A.X signal leads to the recruitment of the p400/Tip60 containing NuA4 remolding complex via MDC1. p400 catalyzes H2A.Z to histone acetylation and ubiquitination at the DSB site 3. Histone exchange and modifications at the DSB site transitions the chromatin into an open state that is permissive for HR repair . Here we show that Disruptor of telomerase-1 Like (DOT1L) is required for H2A.Z exchange at DSB sites. DOT1L and its homologues are only histone 3 lysine 79 (H3K79) methyltransferase in eukaryotic cells responsible for deposition of mono, di and tri methyl marks. Cells from Dot1L -/- mice have increased genomic instability and defects in DNA repair. Loss of DOT1L and its methylation activity resulted in decreased H2A.Z incorporation at DSB sites, increased amounts of single strand DNA (ssDNA) and decreased HR repair activity. We hypothesize that DOT1L and H3K79 methylation marks facilitate histone exchange at DSB sites generating a chromatin state that is permissive for HR repair and in the absence of either the NHEJ repair pathway is utilized leading to genomic instability. 2921. Regulation of Erk1/2-Elk-1 Signaling Pathway of Cancer Biology, 2Liver Center, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS 66010,USA Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide; however the prognosis of patients with metastatic HCC is extremely poor. This is partly due to unclear molecular mechanisms underlying HCC invasion and metastasis. We previously found that MDM2 Binding Protein (MTBP) suppresses migration and metastasis of HCC cells. Expression of MTBP is significantly reduced in human HCC tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues, and MTBP expression is negatively correlated with capsular/vascular invasion and lymph node metastasis. However, detailed mechanisms and signaling pathways regulated by MTBP remain unclear. Toward these goals, we performed a luciferase reporter-based signal array analysis and found that MTBP suppressed the activity of the ETS-domain transcription factor Elk-1, a downstream target of Erk1/2 MAP kinases. Importantly, ERK1/2 activation plays an important role in metastasis and also regulates stem cell proliferation and inhibition of differentiation. Here we show that MTBP also inhibited phosphorylation of Elk-1, as well as mRNA expression of Elk-1 target genes, c-fos, EGR-1, and PKC. The effect of MTBP on the Elk-1 activity was caused by reduced nuclear translocation of phosphorylated (p-Erk) with 7/RanBP7 (IPO7), an importin family member that shuttles p-Erk into the nucleus, through its binding to IPO7 at the C-terminal region (amino acids 760 to 904 in MTBP). Moreover, primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) with ~25% of MTBP expression of the wild-type had significant increase in the nuclear p-Erk localization and migratory potential, as compared with wild-type MEFs. These results provide evidence that MTBP regulates metastasis, at least partially, by suppressing the Erk1/2-Elk-1 pathway. 22. (ORAL PRESENTATION) Genetic Screens to Identify the Regulators of Homology Recombination Pathway in Ovarian Cancer. Pingping Fang 1 and Jeremy Chien1,2 1Department of Pharmacology, Toxicology, and Therapeutics, 2Department of Cancer Biology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGS-OvCa) is the most common subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer and accounts for around 70% of all ovarian cancers. In HGS-OvCa, genes involved in homologous recombination (HR) are altered in about 50% of cases, and FoxM1 transcription factor network is activated in more than 84% of cases. HR-defective cancer cells, including those with deleterious mutations in BRCA1/2 or defects in other HR pathway genes, are highly sensitive to PARP inhibitors. Activation of FoxM1 pathway has been shown to upregulate genes involved in HR, which can lead to PARP inhibitor resistance. The aims of our study are (1) to identify novel regulators that contribute to PARP inhibitor sensitivity; (2) to explore new combination therapy to overcome PARP inhibitor resistance and enhance its therapeutic effects. Using PARP inhibitor sensitivity as a surrogate, we performed a CRISPR/Cas9 system based genome-scale genetic screen in ovarian cancer A2780 cells. TIGAR was identified as a candidate gene that regulates olaparib resistance. Knock-down of TIGAR with FoxM1 inhibitor thiostrepton decreases TIGAR expression, as well as the expression of HR genes, such as BRCA1, FANCF, BRIP1, BRCC3, and the combinations of thiostrepton with olaparib produce synergistic cytotoxicity in ovarian cancer. These results indicate that thiostrepton sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to PARP inhibitor through down-regulation of HR pathway. Collectively, our genetic screens identify novel modulators of olaparib sensitivity, and our results identify FoxM1 inhibitor Thiostrepton as a compound that can induce \"BRCAness\" and sensitize cancer cells to olaparib. 23. VCP Inhibitors Induce Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) Stress and Synergistically Kill Ovarian Cancer Cells in Combination with Salubrinal or Mifepristone. Prabhakar Bastola 1, Frank 1Department of Pharmacology, Toxicology and Therapeutics, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA 2Department of Cancer Biology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA 3Higuchi Biosciences Center, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66047, USA 4Target Acceleration Group, University of Kansas Cancer Center, Kansas City, KS 66047, USA 30Valosin-containing protein (VCP) or p97, a member of AAA-ATPase protein family, has been linked to several cellular functions including endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD), cell division, golgi-membrane reassembly and autophagy. Recent studies have indicated VCP as one of the vulnerabilities in ovarian cancer. Here, we show that treatment with CB-5083, an orally bioavailable compound derived from previously identified contributes to cytotoxicity in or clear cell ovarian cancer cell lines. CB-5083 treatment results in increased unfolded protein response (UPR), accumulation of cell cycle proteins as a result of inhibition of proteosomal degradation, cell cycle arrest at G1, and subsequent cell death mediated by both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. These results support an emerging concept that ER stress pathway can be therapeutically targeted in ovarian cancer. Since CB-5083 induces CHOP-dependent apoptosis, we tested the extent to which VCP inhibitors act synergistically with salubrinal, a compound that inhibits GADD34 and enhances eIF2 phosphorylation. Results from Sulforadamine B and assays indicate that VCP inhibitors and salubrinal act synergistically across various concentrations of drug combination. Based on recent studies indicating that mifepristone, a steroidal antagonist to progesterone and glucocorticoid, induce ER stress and subsequent cell death, we also tested the potential drug synergies between VCP inhibitors and mifepristone. Our results indicate these drugs act synergistically across various concentrations in ovarian cancer cells. Analysis of TCGA RNA-sequencing datasets indicate VCP expression is down-regulated in cisplatin-resistant tumor samples compared to cisplatin-sensitive cancer. This data is consistent with the fact that tumors with lower expression of VCP shows significant association with poor progression-free survival and overall survivor. Finally, our results indicate that cells with lower expression of VCP are more sensitive to VCP inhibitors than those with higher expression. Considering that cisplatin-resistant tumor samples have lower expression of VCP, VCP inhibitors may be a good therapeutic candidate to treat cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer. Collectively, our results provide evidence that VCP inhibitors can be used as a single agent and can be synergized with compounds that prolong or induce ER stress in ovarian cancer. 24. The Effects of Maternal Undernutrition during the Periconceptional Period on the Mouse Placenta. Gerialisa Van Gronigen Caesar 1,2, Lauren Parmeley1, Laura C. Schulz2 1 Division of Biological Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 2 Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Women's Health, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO Adverse maternal nutrition has detrimental effects on fetal development and adult health. The placenta is crucial for fetal development and may be programmed by maternal nutrition during early pregnancy. Women exposed to famine during the first trimester followed by adequate diet showed increased placental weight at delivery compared to control mothers, and their sons had increased incidence of metabolic disease as adults. Similar effects occur in sheep. On the other hand, in guinea pigs maternal food restriction prior to and during the first half of gestation reduced placental surface area and labyrinth zone at term. Previously , we found mouse dams fed 50% of ad libitum intake from d1.5 to d11.5 had smaller placental weights and junctional zones at d11.5, but these changes were reversed when food was returned to normal in later pregnancy, indicating ability of the mouse placenta to recover from the early adverse intrauterine environment, but not to overgrow, as had been observed in sheep and humans. Here, we tested whether the periconceptual period\u00b8 in which oocyte selection, maturation and DNA methylation reprogramming occur, is a critical time at which maternal nutrient restriction early in pregnancy may permanently alter the placenta. Mice were fed either 50% ad libitum consumption levels (n=6) or ad libitum (n=5) from -3 weeks of pregnancy until d11.5. Both groups were fed ad libitum from d11.5- d18.5. At 18.5, placental morphology and gene expression were analyzed. There were no significant differences in placental weights, efficiency (fetal/placental weight), or sizes of junctional and labyrinth zones between dietary groups. Real-time RT-PCR was used to measure relative transcript levels of genes specific to the major trophoblast lineages: Hand1 (synctiotrophoblast cells). To compare mRNA levels, C t were analyzed by Students' t-test, with results averaged from 3 placentae per dam to obtain n=1. Expression of these placental markers was similar in the two groups. Thus, periconceptual undernutrition does not cause overgrowth of the mouse placenta near term. 3125. Role of Aryl Hydrocarbon Iqbal , Pramod Dhakal, Katherine Roby, Michael J. Soares. Institute for Reproductive Health and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix-PER-ARNT-SIM superfamily of transcription factors. AHR ligands consist of persistent organic pollutants such as dioxins. AHR heterodimerizes with AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT), resulting AhR/ARNT heterodimer complex that binds to the dioxin/xenobiotic-response element located in the regulatory region of AHR target genes. This results in induction of transcription of cytochrome P450 enzymes such as Cyp1a1 detoxification of environmental pollutants. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF1A) is a bHLH-PAS protein and a key player in the hypoxia signaling pathway. HIF1A also dimerizes with ARNT and binds to promoters of target genes that facilitate adaptations to hypoxia and also contribute to the regulation of hemochorial placentation and development of the invasive trophoblast lineage. Activation of AHR during gestation may result in competition between AHR and HIF pathways for ARNT leading to interference in HIF1A mediated placental development. The purpose of this study was to explore how exposure to dioxins acting through AHR shapes placental development. In the current study, we used 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD) as a model compound. Pregnant female Holtzman Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to TCDD under normoxic conditions at 6.5 days post coitum (dpc) and placental tissues were collected. TCDD exposure resulted in a significant upregulation of transcripts for Cyp1a1 and Cyp1a2 in liver, ectoplacental cone (EPC), and placental tissues but it did not significantly impact placental and/or fetal survival. Immunostaining of CYP1A1 in 13.5 dpc placentation sites revealed activation of AHR signaling in decidua/metrial gland and labyrinth zone of the chorioallantoic placenta. TCDD treated 13.5 dpc placentation sites exhibited deep intrauterine trophoblast invasion characterized by cytokeratin positive endovascular trophoblast cells lining the uterine spiral arteries. In order to explore the mechanistic details of TCDD action on placental development we generated an Ahr null rat model. To this end, CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing was used to delete Exon 2 of the Ahr gene. Genotyping of F2 pups verified the germline transmission. The resulting homozygous mutant rats failed to express AHR and to induce xenobiotic metabolizing CYP1A1 enzyme expression following TCDD exposure. Initial studies indicate that Ahr-null rats are fertile and will be used to evaluate the role of AHR signaling in TCDD actions on placentation. In summary, we have identified a developmental window of sensitivity to environmental pollutants af fecting hemochorial placentation with the potential of impacting fetal and postnatal health (Supported by NIH grants: HD20676, HD079363) Impairs Spermatogonial Stem Cell (SSC) Maintenance and Reduces Fertility in Male Mice.

Antiangiogenic VEGFA165b treatment reduced SSC colonization in germ cell-depleted recipient mice. Elimination of both angiogenic and antiangiogenic VEGFA isoforms in Sertoli and germ cells reduced fertility, epididymal sperm numbers and the number of ZBTB16-positive spermatogonia per seminiferous tubule in 6 we hypothesized VEGFA angiogenic isoforms SSC maintenance number. Consequently, Cre recombinase-mediated deletion of Vegfa was driven by the Sry promoter. Either control or Sry-Cre;Vegfa -/- (KO) mice were mated to control females of proven fertility. KO males took longer to get females pregnant at the first parturition (P = 0.0003) and over all parturition intervals ( P < 0.0001). KO males sired fewer pups compared to control males ( P < 0.03). Control and KO males were collected at various ages: postnatal loss of cells in KO seminiferous tubules while some P200 testes exhibited Transplantation assays were conducted using P30 control and KO males as donors. Busulfan-treated C57B6 mice were used as germ cell-depleted recipients, and SSCs were allowed 6 weeks to colonize recipient tubules. Analysis of recipient testes revealed approximately a 20% numerical reduction in spermatogenic tubules in males that 32were microinjected with cells from KO donors compared to controls at P30 ( P = 0.36). Finally, qPCR analysis was performed using whole testis mRNA. Abundance of Id4 was increased almost 2-fold ( P < 0.009) along with an almost 3-fold increase in Bcl6b (P < 0.003) in testes from KO males compared to controls at P60. Both ID4 and BCL6B promote the self-renewal of subpopulation of undifferentiated spermatogonia, possibly the SSCs. Compensatory increases in genes that promote SSC maintenance is a similar trend seen previously when all VEGFA isoforms were eliminated in Sertoli and germ cells. The current study demonstrates that VEGFA isoforms produced by Sertoli cells are critical for SSC maintenance as well as male fertility. 27. Extracellular Vesicles: Production by Human Endometrial Cells. Eleanore V. O'Neil , Gregory W. Burns, Linda M. Rowland, and Thomas E. Spencer. Division of Animal Sciences, 158 ASRC, 920 East Campus Drive, University of Missouri, Columbia 65211 The receptive uterus represents a temporary, but unique physiological state when conceptus development and implantation is possible. Coordinated interactions between the luminal epithelium and underlying stroma are required for uterine remodeling and acquisition of uterine receptivity. Inadequate uterine receptivity and conceptus-maternal interactions negatively affects conceptus development, signaling for pregnancy recognition, implantation and establishment of pregnancy. Defects in those critical biological processes are considered primary causes of pregnancy loss and may be the origin of later pregnancy complications in humans. Extracellular vesicles (EVs; exosomes/microvesicles) are nano-sized, cell-derived vesicles communication by entering target cells and eliciting biological effects via gene regulation and alteration of cellular pathways impacting cell survival, growth and function. Our central hypothesis is that EVs, emanating from the endometrium and conceptus, are important functional mediators of epithelial-stromal remodeling and conceptus-endometrial interactions. In the present experiment, we studied EVs from Ishikawa (gland adenocarcinoma) and immortalized human differentiated using estradiol (E2) and medroxyprogesterone (MPA) in DMEM/F12 Media with bovine serum (FBS) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (Pen-strep). HES cells were differentiated into decidual cells using a standard protocol with E2, MPA and cyclic AMP in Opti-MEM Media with stripped, exosome depleted FBS and 1% Pen-strep. Undifferentiated and differentiated cells were then cultured for two days in serum free media. EVs were isolated from the media using size exclusion chromatography and quantified using a NanoSight NS300 instrument. Undif ferentiated and differentiated Ishikawa cells released 2.2x10 8 particles and 1.2x108 particles per ml of media with mean sizes of 191 and 183 nm, respectively. Media from undifferentiated HES cells contained 1.8x107 particles per ml with a mean of size of 173 nm, and media from decidualized HES cells contained 1.2x107 particles per ml with a mean size of 176 nm. Thus, human endometrial epithelial cells release significantly more EVs than stromal cells in vitro (P < 0.05). Future studies will define the cargo of the isolated EVs and their effects on cellular function. 28. Na,K-ATPase 4 is Essential to Preserve Sperm Flagellar Morphology. Gustavo Blanco and Jeffrey P. McDermott. Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology. University of Kansas Medical Center. Kansas City, KS 66160. Na,K-ATPase, the ion transporter that uses the energy from ATP to exchange extracellular K + for cytoplasmic Na+, is expressed as different molecular forms. Na,K-ATPase 4 (NAK 4) is a testis specific isoform, abundantly expressed in the sperm flagellum. NAK 4 deletion in mice causes complete male, but not female, infertility. Besides decreased motility and almost lack of hyperactivation, sperm devoid of NAK 4 exhibits a characteristic bend in the sperm flagellum. Here, we characterized the morphological changes that af fect sperm null in NAK 4. Light microscopy analysis showed that sperm null in NAK 4 are morphologically normal when collected from the testis and caput epididymis. In contrast, when sperm null in NAK 4 is obtained from the cauda epididymis, it exhibited a bend between the mid- and principal piece of the sperm flagellum. This bend showed variable degree of angulation and even complete retroflexion of the head and flagellar midpiece over the principal piece of the sperm tail. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that at the junction of the bend, there was dilation of the sperm flagellum and fusion of the plasma membrane, which is analogous to the defects seen in sperm with deficiencies in osmolality control. In addition, we found defects in the axoneme 33structure and outer dense fibers in the mid- and principal piece of the flagellum. Osmotic challenge tests, using solutions over a wide range of osmolarities (50, 150, 250 and 450 mOsmol/Kg/H2O), showed that epididymal caudal sperm from NAK 4 mice have a lower capacity to regulate intracellular volume than epididymal caudal sperm from wild type mice. Wild-type sperm underwent a decrease in swelling as the medium conditions changed from hypotonic to the hypertonic and they maintained high viability. NAK 4 null sperm also showed a decrease in swelling as osmolality increased; however, the amount of cells that exhibited swelling was always significantly lower than that of wild-type sperm. Interestingly, increasing the osmolality of the medium improved the viability of the null spermatozoa; however, its morphological alterations remained the same. Exposure to 0.1% Triton X-100, which disrupts the cell plasma membrane, only partially recovered the sperm flagellar bend of NAK 4 null sperm. These results suggests that deficiencies in osmotic control, as well as additional structural defects cause the abnormal flagellar bent phenotype of sperm null in NAK 4. Proteomic analyses indicated a decrease in expression of structural proteins, including outer dense fiber proteins 1 and 2, dynein intermediate fiber 1, A-kinase anchor proteins 3 and 4, and actin cytoplasmic 2. Altogether, our results show that NAK 4 plays an important role in maintaining sperm osmolality and the structural stability of the sperm flagellum. Supported by NIH grant U01HD080423. 29. Interactive Effect of Perinatal BPA Exposure and Post-weaning Growth Rate on Adult Growth and Metabolic Profile in C57BL/6J Mice. Chun-Xia Meng 1, Julia A. Taylor2, Christopher D. Victoria D. Balise1,2, Chiamaka Saal2 and Susan C. Nagel1 1Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology & Women's Health, University of Missouri, Columbia MO; 2Department of Biological Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia MO; 3Nicholas School of the Environment, Duke University, Durham NC Perinatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) has been associated with adult obesity and insulin resistance. Catch-up growth, defined as fetal growth restriction followed by rapid weight gain in early life, has also been associated with adult obesity and insulin resistance. We hypothesized that perinatal BPA exposure interacts with catch-up growth to program adult growth and metabolic profile. W e administered three doses of BPA (16, 160, 1600 \u00b5g/kg/day via Silastic capsule) versus vehicle to pregnant C57BL/6J mice (n=10/group) from gestational day 7 until postnatal day 7. Prior to the pregnancy, the females were hemi-ovariectomized to create intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) by having a whole litter in one uterine horn. We found BPA 16 and 160 \u00b5g/kg/day treatments increased birth weight variation in females, which suggests some pups underwent IUGR. The post-weaning growth rate between weeks 3 and 5 was negatively related to the weaning weight, that is, the lightest mice at weaning gained a higher percentage of their body weight \u2014 \"catch up growth\". BPA 16 and 1,600 \u00b5g/kg/day exacerbated this negative relationship in female offspring, and showed a similar tendency in male offspring. Post-weaning catch-up growth remained into adulthood, but BPA 16 \u00b5g/kg/day abolished catch-up growth in males, that is, the lightest mice at weaning stayed the lightest with least fat mass in male adulthood. There were no differences in body weight, adiposity, or glucose tolerance when examining perinatal BPA treatment alone. Based on the percentage of weight gain during post-weaning period weeks 3 and 5 within treatment, offspring were divided into slow, medium, and rapid growth. In response to a high fat and sugar diet, perinatal BPA exposure interacted with post-weaning growth rate to alter glucose tolerance in adulthood. Combined with perinatal exposure to BPA 16 \u00b5g/kg/day, males with slow post-weaning growth and females with rapid post-weaning growth developed mild glucose intolerance. In conclusion, perinatal BPA exposure exacerbated post-weaning catch-up growth while abolished adulthood catch-up growth in males. Perinatal exposure to BPA at a level realistic for human and animal exposure and abnormal post-weaning growth rate together, although not individually, may increase the risk of glucose intolerance in response to a high fat and sugar diet. 30. Characterization of Genome-wide DNA Methylation at Base Resolution in Overgrowth Syndrome Induced by Assisted Reproduction. Zhiyuan Chen a, Darren E. Hagena, Tieming Jib, Christine G. Elsika, Roc\u00edo Melissa Riveraa aDivision of Animal Sciences, bDepartment of Statistics, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 34Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is the most common pediatric overgrowth syndrome, which is characterized by macrosomia, macroglossia, omphalocele, and increased frequency of childhood tumor. Repots estimate a 5.2-increased likelihood of BWS in children conceived by the use of assisted reproductive technologies. In bovine, large offspring syndrome (LOS) is an overgrowth condition that is both phenotypically and epigenetically similar to BWS, and LOS has been proposed as an animal model to study the etiology of BWS. We have recently shown that LOS exhibits loss of DNA methylation at several imprinted loci, suggesting that misregulation of methylation contributes to LOS/BWS. To determine the extent of misregulation of DNA methylation in LOS, we generated DNA methylome of skeletal muscle from four control and four LOS day ~105 Bos indicus \u00d7 Bos taurus F 1 fetuses using bisulfite-sequencing. We first analyzed the methylome of the controls to establish a DNA methylation baseline in bovine fetal tissues. In control fetuses, DNA methylation exhibits a bimodal pattern with the majority of genomic sequences hypermethylated, while most CpG islands are hypomethylated. We next queried the role of DNA methylation in the regulation of gene expression using RNAseq of skeletal muscle from the same controls. For genes with high and intermediate CpG density promoters, there appears a negative association between methylation level at promoters and transcript abundance. However, low CpG density promoters are usually methylated with no association with transcript abundance. In addition, we identified 86 regions displaying allele-specific DNA methylation, with 18 of them located within imprinted loci. Importantly, we also identified differentially methylation regions (DMRs) between LOS and controls. The DMRs identified not only include the imprinted loci known to be associated with LOS/BWS such as IGF2R-DMR2 and KvDMR1 but also novel DMRs beyond the imprinted genes. Currently we are investigating the role of novel DMRs in LOS/BWS. 31. Human Follicular Fluid Induces the Endogenous Cell , Nehemiah S. Alvarez, Lane K. Christenson, Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Kansas Medical Center Introduction: Ovulation results in the release of an oocyte and a mixture of follicular fluid (FF). Recent studies indicate high grade serous ovarian carcinomas originate in the fallopian epithelium, and ovarian cancer risk is significantly reduced by inhibiting ovulation. We hypothesize that FF exposure may contribute to the malignant transformation of fallopian epithelium. Methods/Materials: We exposed normal immortalized fallopian tube epithelium to FF and plasma from patients undergoing infertility treatment (n=8). Results: After 24h exposure to FF, cell proliferation was significantly increased (3.1 fold, p<0.05 ANOVA). FF exposure also significantly increased double strand breaks and overall DNA damage accumulation (p<0.05 ANOVA) in fallopian epithelial cell lines. Importantly, plasma from the same patients did not have the same proliferative or DNA damaging effects, indicating that the effects are FF specific. Consistent with increased DNA damage, FF exposure also generates micronuclei, indicating genomic instability (p<0.05 Student's T-test). Low grade ovarian carcinomas have genomic signature of transversion mutations, indicative of cytidine deamination activity, typical of proteins called APOBECs. We discovered increased Apobec3a expression at the mRNA and protein levels after exposure to 5 out of 8 individual FF samples (p<0.05 ANOVA) in three separate cell lines. Lastly, transient Apobec3a overexpression is sufficient to induce 53BP1 foci formation. Conclusions : Our data demonstrate a proliferative and DNA-damaging effect of FF on fallopian epithelium. Increased Apobec3a expression may contribute to the DNA damage seen after FF exposure, however the factors within FF responsible for this effect are unknown. We are working to identify the constituents of FF that induce these changes, to shed light on pathways and that occur in ovarian carcinogenesis.

RLS, MM, DC, and MJS; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, KUMC. LN, JC; Department of Cancer Biology, KUMC The hemochorial placenta is composed of specialized trophoblast cell types that interact with uterine spiral arteries. These trophoblast cells are endowed with invasive properties allowing them to exit the developing placenta and direct changes in the uterine vasculature that promote the effective delivery of nutrients to the placenta. Furthermore, this migratory trophoblast cell population is undermined in diseases of pregnancy such 35as preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and early pregnancy loss. However, their location within the uterine wall precludes their routine analysis in human placentation sites. The rat exhibits deep intrauterine trophoblast invasion and represents an effective animal model for investigating the biology of trophoblast invasion and uterine spiral artery remodeling. The purpose of this investigation was to profile the transcriptome of invasive trophoblast cells in the rat. Transgenic male rats constitutively expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) were mated with wild type female rats. On gestation day 18.5, placentation sites were dissected into metrial gland (site of intrauterine trophoblast invasion) and junctional zone (site of invasive trophoblast progenitors and other differentiated trophoblast lineages) compartments. GFP-positive tissues were enzymatically dissociated and GFP-positive trophoblast cells collected by flow cytometry and cell sorting. RNA was isolated from the GFP-positive cells, libraries generated, and sequenced to generate 100 bp paired- end reads. Bioinformatic and pathway analyses were performed. Transcript signatures consistent with cellular movement, inflammatory response, and cellular development were identified. Transcript expression profiles were validated by qR T-PCR on independent metrial gland and junctional zone compartment samples. Striking differences in metrial gland versus junctional zone transcript profiles for specific pathways (Igf, Notch, Wnt, (Maf, Irf5, Zeb2) were observed. The dataset is robust and provides a platform to uncover candidate regulators for in vivo investigation of pathways controlling the invasive trophoblast lineage.

Division of Biological Sciences and Department of Ob, Gyn & Women's Health, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO. Gestational diabetes has been shown to predispose offspring to various facets of metabolic syndrome including insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. As the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) rises globally, studies outlining the mechanisms through which GDM adversely programs offspring health are much needed. In the present study, dams exhibiting GDM were mated to WT sires and the offspring were assessed. The dams exhibited characteristics of GDM, including glucose intolerance, and reduced insulin response to glucose challenge only during pregnancy, without accompanying obesity. Body composition was assessed at 5, 12 and 21 weeks of age. Compared to offspring of control dams, male offspring of GDM dams exhibited increased body fat percentage at 12 weeks (p=0.01), and 21 (p=0.05) weeks of age, while females offspring of GDM dams only showed higher body fat percentage at 21 weeks (p=0.01). Offspring of GDM dams did not differ from controls in regards to weight, glucose tolerance, serum leptin, insulin, or IL-6 levels at 19 weeks of age. Offspring liver triglycerides were also unaffected by maternal GDM at 19 weeks of age. Preliminary results indicate that GDM programs offspring increased adiposity. Ongoing experiments will determine whether obesity and insulin resistance subsequently develop in offspring of GDM pregnancies. 34. Alterations in Porcine Ovarian Signaling Induced by Metabolic Endotoxemia. Mackenzie J. Dickson, Jackson Nteeba, Sara K. Kvidera, Lance H. Baumgard, Jason W. Ross, Aileen F. Keating. Department of Animal Science, Iowa State University. Heat stress (HS) is defined as environmental pressures that result in elevated core body temperature. HS negatively affects animal reproductive viability, and is associated with seasonal infertility (SI), which costs the U.S. swine industry approximately $450 million annually. SI manifests as spontaneous abortion, reduced pregnancy and first service conception rates. Intestinal integrity is compromised during HS, leading to elevated systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS; metabolic endotoxemia (ME)). Akin to HS, LPS exposure induces spontaneous abortion. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a membrane bound protein, binds LPS thereby initiating a signaling cascade, which ultimately phosphorylates nuclear factor kappa B (pNF -B). We hypothesized that HS-induced ME alters ovarian signaling pathways and is at least partially culpable for SI. Ovaries were collected from pre-pubertal gilts (35 \u00b1 4 kg) who were exposed to TN (20C; 35-50% humidity) conditions or HS (35C; 20-35% humidity) for 35 d. A separate group of gilts received an LPS bolus (5 \u00b5g/kg BW) via i.v. infusion and ovaries were collected 8 h thereafter. Western blotting was performed to quantify altered abundance of TLR4, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), total protein kinase B (AKT), and phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAKT), due to HS or LPS treatment. Ovarian TLR4 protein abundance was markedly increased ( P < 0.05) by HS. LPS-exposed gilts had increased ( P < 0.05) ovarian TLR4 protein abundance, 36while no effect (P > 0.05) of LPS on ovarian IRS1 was observed. Additionally, LPS exposure increased ( P < 0.05) pAKT while total AKT protein was unchanged. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the receptor for LPS is activated in the ovary during HS and support that ME alters ovarian signaling pathways that could contribute to SI in swine. This project was partially supported by the National Pork Board as well as by a Land O'Lakes Inc. graduate fellowship to MJD. 35. Regulation of MicroRNA-29 by REST Controls ADAM12 and Vargheese Chennathukuzhi. The Center for Reproductive Sciences, Institute for Reproductive Health and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Molecular and Inte - grative Physiology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS. Uterine leiomyomas (ULs), also known as uterine fibroids, are benign smooth muscle cell tumors of the myo - metrium and are the most frequent reason for a hysterectomy. Although benign, these tumors pose a signifi - cant burden on patients with symptoms of abnormal pain, pressure, uterine bleeding, and infertility; creating a great liability for the US economy with an annual estimated cost of up to $34 billion. Currently there are no long-term treatments for fibroids that will leave fertility intact, mainly because the mechanism of pathogen - esis of these tumors is largely unknown. One of the key characteristics of ULs is the excessive deposition and reorganization of extracellular matrix (ECM). Analysis of available gene expression datasets from GEO database indicates that ADAM12 expression is dramatically upregulated in ULs. ADAM12 is known to cleave ECM proteins, activate epidermal growth factor (EGF) and Insulin-like growth factor signaling and promote tumorigenesis. Our lab has recently shown the expression of the tumor suppressor REST to be lost in ULs. Interestingly, Ingenuity\u00ae pathway analyses of gene expression datasets for UL indicate that the loss of REST and the increase in ADAM12 expression in leiomyomas could be linked through microRNA-29 (miR-29). Fur- thermore, in cultured mammary tumor cell lines, miR-29 is known to directly regulate ADAM12 expression. Compared to normal myometrium, uterine fibroids express significantly lower levels of miR-29. In its promoter , miR-29 contains an RE1 element, a putative binding site for REST. In order to see how the loss of REST in UL could affect miR-29, we silenced REST in primary myometrial cells and saw a significant decrease in miR-29 expression. In addition, western blot analysis showed an increase in ADAM12 expression and EGF receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation when REST was knocked-down in primary myometrial cells. Furthermore, we found that inhibiting miR-29 in myometrial cells results in an increase in the expression of ADAM12 and EGFR phos - phorylation. Conversely, the opposite effects were seen when leiomyoma cells were treated with miR-29 mim - ics. In conclusion, we report a novel druggable pathway that links the loss of REST, down regulation of miR-29, increased ADAM12 expression, and the activation of EGFR in uterine fibroids.

Peng Wang 1, Andrew Kelleher1, James K. Pru2, Cindy A. Pru2 and Thomas E. Spencer1 1Division of Animal Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 2Department of Animal Sciences, Washington State University, Pullman, WA 99164 Studies of uterine gland knockout mice support the hypothesis that endometrial glands and, by inference, their secretions have important biological roles in uterine receptivity, blastocyst implantation and stromal cell decidualization. Forkhead box a2 ( Foxa2) is a transcription factor, which is expressed specifically in uterine glandular epithelial (GE) cells in both the neonatal and adult mouse. Conditional deletion of Foxa2 in the neonatal uterus inhibited GE differentiation, producing an adult uterine gland knockout phenotype. In order to test the hypothesis that Foxa2 regulates adult uterine gland function, we conditionally deleted the floxed Foxa2 gene in uterine GE cells using lactotransferrin (Ltf)-iCre mice. In Ltf-iCre mice, Cre recombinase is expressed under the control of the endogenous Ltf promoter and directs recombination in the uterine epithelium after at least postnatal day 40, subsequent to the completion of normal GE development after birth. Immunohistochemical analysis of control and Foxa2 cKO mice revealed that Foxa2 was efficiently deleted in the uterus by postnatal day 60. A breeding trial established that Foxa2 cKO mice were completely infertile. Although normal embryos were present in Foxa2 cKO uteri on gestational day (GD) 4, no implantation sites were observed on GD 6. Real-time PCR was used to evaluate gene expression in control and Foxa2 cKO uteri on GD 3, 4 and 6. Expression of Foxa2 and several GE-specific genes ( Ttr, Cxcl15, Lif, Spink3, Prss29) were decreased or not observed in the Foxa2 cKO uteri. Both control and Foxa2 cKO mice were bred to 37vasectomized males and decidualization was artificially induced by intrauterine oil injection. Analysis of uterine wet weights revealed diminished stromal cell decidualization of uteri from Foxa2 cKO mice, a phenotype that paralleled a decrease in critical decidualization genes ( Wnt4 and Lif) on GD 4. Immunohistochemical analysis also shows that expressions of another two critical decidualization genes ( Ptgs2 and Foxo1) were abnormal in Foxa2 cKO uteri on GD 6. Collectively, these results suggest that Foxa2 is indispensable for normal uterine gland function and regulates GE genes important for blastocyst implantation and stromal cell decidualization. 37. Elimination of VEGFA in Granulosa and Sertoli Cells via Sry-Cre Decreases Fertility in Adult Mice by Increasing Parturition Intervals and Decreasing Pups per Litter. Mariah L. Hart 1, Scott G. Kurz1, Kevin M. Sargent1, Napoleone Ferrara2, Gerrit J. Bouma3, S. Cupp1.1University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, USA, 2University of San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA, 3Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA Reduction of VEGFA isoforms through generation of a conditional knockout mouse pDmrt1-Cre; Vegfa-/- reduced fertility in both male and females. The pDmrt-cre eliminated all Vegfa isoforms in germ and somatic cells. We sought to determine if eliminating Vegfa with the use of a Sry-Cre (ectopic expression thus elimination of Vegfa in Sertoli and granulosa cells) would also affect fertility in mice. Our hypothesis was that the elimination of VEGFA via Sry-Cre would reduce fertility in males and females similarly to pDmrt1- Cre, suggesting that elimination of Vegfa expression in germ cells was not as detrimental in somatic cells. Production of Sry-Cre;Vegfa -/- mice occurred by mating Sry-Cre mice with Vegfa floxed mice. Fertility of female Sry-Cre;Vegfa-/- mice was determined by mating them to control males. The interval between mating and the first parturition was longer ( P < 0.02; 54 days) in the KO females when compared to control matings. All parturition intervals between litters were longer ( P < 0.03; 15 days) in the KO females compared to controls. There were no differences (P = 0.25) in the number of pups born in the first litter between KO and controls. KO females produced fewer pups per litter over all litters ( P < 0.05; 2 pups) compared to controls. We compared average body weights (BW) in KO females to controls. There was a significant decrease in BW of KO ( P < 0.002; 2.85 g) when compared to controls (n=19). Male fertility was tested by mating KO males to control females. Mating to first parturition interval was longer ( P = 0.003; 11 days) in KO matings compared to controls. All parturition intervals were longer ( P < 0.0001; 16 days) in KO matings compared to control matings. There was no difference (P = 0.12) in the number of pups in the first litter. There was a decrease in total number of pups per litter over all litters ( P < 0.03; 1 pup) in KO males when compared to controls. These data indicate KO females and males have reduced fertility if Vegfa is eliminated via Sry-Cre, suggesting expression in somatic cells is critical for optimal reproductive function. 38. Pluripotent Stem Cell Models in the KUMC Transgenic Facility. Julia Draper , Jennifer Pace, Illya Bronshteyn, Jay L. Vivian, and Melissa Larson. Transgenic and Gene Targeting Institutional Facility, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS. Pluripotent stem cells are important tools for biomedical researchers to study gene function and develop models of human disease. Gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem cells is a critical tool for advanced manipulation of the mouse genome. Patient specific human induced pluripotent stem cells provide unique tools for capturing the genetic information of a patient into a cell line with the capacity to differentiate into virtually any cell type. The techniques employed for the generation of pluripotent stem cell models require technical expertise. The KUMC Transgenic and Gene-Targeting Institutional Facility is a core facility that supports researchers interested in both mouse and human pluripotent stem cell models. The Facility uses cutting edge methods, state-of-the-art instrumentation, and novel reagents for this work. The Facility's stem cell core performs gene targeting in stem cells, cell culture and preparation for injection for generating chimeric mice, and karyotyping. The Facility also has expertise in differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells. Our recent efforts include successful site-directed transgene integration and mutagenesis into human and mouse pluripotent stem cells using genome editing tools such as CRISPR/Cas9. In this poster we will present recent projects supported by the TGIF using pluripotent stem cell models. 3839. Regulation of SATB Homeobox 1 Gene Expression in of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, 2Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS; 3Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Program, 4Department of Genetics, Development and Cell Biology, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA. SATB homeobox proteins (SATB1 and SATB2) play an important regulatory role in trophoblast stem (TS) cell renewal and differentiation. Both Satb1 and Satb2 genes are abundantly expressed in the trophoblast cell stem-state, but their expression declines during differentiation. Here we report the molecular mechanisms that regulate Satb1 expression in TS cells. Satb1 transcript variants and alternative transcription start sites were detected by RNA-seq and RT-PCR analyses. The location of the proximal promoters for Satb1 variants, presence of the distal enhancers, as well as binding of the putative transcription factors were determined by ChIP-seq and ChIP analyses. Activities of the promoters and a distal enhancer were further assessed using luciferase reporters. Variant 1 and 2 are the predominant Satb1 transcripts expressed in TS cells. The active chromatin state of the proximal promoters was detected by the presence of H3K4me3, H3K9ac and H3K27ac and absence of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 marks. Both proximal promoters possessed conserved CpG islands, however, DNA methylation remained unchanged during trophoblast differentiation. The proximal promoters exhibited a low level of transcriptional activity in TS cells, but inclusion of a distal enhancer (enrichened with H3K27ac and H3K4me1 marks) increased the promoter activity in a trophoblast-specific manner. ChIP-seq and ChIP assays demonstrated binding of multiple TS cell factors to the enhancer sequence including TEAD4, TFAP2C, ESRRB, ELF5 and LSD1. As expected, serial deletion of these binding sites markedly decreased the enhancer activity in TS cells. Interestingly, this trophoblast-specific Satb1 enhancer also demonstrated enriched SATB1 binding, and the enhancer activity was significantly upregulated following overexpression of either SATB protein. Our findings indicate that trophoblast-specific Satb1 expression is regulated by TS cell TEAD4, TFAP2C, ESRRB, and ELF5. SATB homeobox proteins may also cooperate with those transcriptional regulators to enhance Satb1 expression in TS cells. 40. Oxidative Stress Regulation of mRNA Abundance during Oocyte Maturation Impacts Protein Expression in Pre-Implantation Embryos. Kelsey Timme, Fang Xie and Jennifer R Wood.

T umor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) is a proinflammatory cytokine produced by activated macrophages. Likewise, increased expression of enzymes that convert excess cellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into water, is an indicator of oxidative stress. We have previously demonstrated that ovaries from diet-induced obese female that the ovarian environment of these mice is characterized by both inflammation and oxidative stress. In addition, we have demonstrated that oocytes from obese females have increased abundance of transcripts for Pou5f1, a pluripotency transcription factor, and Dppa3 , a regulator of histone methylation. Our current hypothesis was that induction of oxidative stress using 100 \u00b5M H 2O2 during oocyte maturation would reduce degradation of Pou5f1 and Dppa3 mRNAs resulting in increased translation of POU5F1 and DPPA3 protein in developing embryos. To test this hypothesis, GV oocytes were isolated from PMSG-primed CD1 mice and in vitro matured in the presence (H2O2) or absence (CTL) of H2O2. Some H2O2-exposed and CTL oocytes were fertilized in vitro and cultured to either the 1-cell or 2-cell stage of embryo development. To analyze changes in Pou5f1 and Dppa3 mRNA levels in the matured oocytes and embryos, fluorescent in situ hybridization (F iSH) was performed, visualized by confocal microscopy, and the number of mRNAs counted using Localize software. Both Pou5f1 and Dppa3 mRNA levels were increased in MII oocytes and embryos exposed to H2O2 during oocyte maturation. Furthermore, protein levels of POU5F1 and DPP A3, measured by immunofluorescence, were increased in 1-cell and 2-cell embryos, respectively. These data suggest that exposure of the oocyte to oxidative stress during maturation could have long-term effects on the development of the embryo. 3941. A HIF-KDM3A-MMP12 Regulatory Pathway Triggers Adaptations at the Damayanti Stephen J. Renaud, Adam J. Krieg, M.A. Karim Rumi, Michael J. Soares. Institute for Reproductive Health and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS 66160 The placenta develops from the coordinated multi-lineage differentiation of trophoblast stem cells. The invasive lineage remodels uterine spiral arteries, facilitating nutrient flow , failure of which is associated with pathological conditions such as preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and preterm birth. Low oxygen (hypoxia) signaling plays an instructive role in influencing trophoblast cell dif ferentiation and regulating placental organization. In this study, we perform a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments delineating a hypoxia-activated regulatory pathway controlling hemochorial placentation. Key downstream events are delineated using rat trophoblast stem (TS) cells and tested in vivo, using trophoblast-specific lentiviral gene delivery and genome editing. DNA microarray analyses performed on rat TS cells exposed to ambient or low oxygen showed upregulation of genes characteristic of an invasive/vascular remodeling/inflammatory phenotype and a marked downregulation of stem upregulated genes were H3K9 demethylase and a matrix metalloelastase (Mmp12). We hypothesized that Kdm3a was a mediator of trophoblast cell lineage differentiation and that Mmp12 was a key downstream target. Consistent with the hypothesis, knockdown of Kdm3a in rat TS cells inhibited the expression of a subset of the hypoxia/HIF-dependent transcripts, including Mmp12, altered H3K9 methylation status, and subsequently decreased hypoxia-induced trophoblast cell invasion in vitro and in vivo. Mmp12 possesses the capacity to degrade elastin, modifying the structure of arterial blood vessels. To explore the functional importance of Mmp12 in trophoblast cell-directed spiral artery remodeling, we generated an Mmp12 mutant rat model using TALEN-mediated genome editing. Homozygous mutant rats showed reduced hypoxia-dependent endovascular trophoblast invasion and impaired trophoblast-directed spiral artery remodeling. In summary, we have discovered a hypoxia/HIF/Kdm3a pathway modulating trophoblast cell lineage development, leading to acquisition of the invasive trophoblast cell phenotype, including upregulation of the extracellular matrix-modifying enzyme Mmp12 and subsequent uterine spiral artery remodeling.

Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS. DNA damage in the germline is a double-edged sword. On one hand, induced double-strand breaks establish the foundation for meiotic recombination, which is essential for proper chromosome segregation. On the other hand, double-strand breaks can also pose a significant challenge for genome stability . Within the germline, transposable elements are powerful agents of double-strand break formation. How different types of DNA damage are resolved within the germline is poorly understood. For example, little is known about the relationship between the frequency of double-stranded breaks, both endogenous and exogenous, and the decision to repair DNA through one of many pathways, including crossing over and gene conversion. We aim to use the Drosophila virilis hybrid dysgenesis model to determine how recombination landscapes change under transposable element activation. In this system, a cross between two strains of D. virilis with divergent transposable element loads results in the hybrid dysgenesis phenotype, which includes the germline activation of diverse transposable elements, reduced fertility and male recombination. However, only one direction of the cross results in hybrid dysgenesis. This allows us to examine recombination in genetically identical F1 females; those with baseline levels of programmed DNA damage and those with an increased level of DNA damage resulting from transposable element proliferation. We are using multiplexed shotgun genotyping to map crossover events to compare the recombination landscapes of hybrid dysgenic and non-hybrid dysgenic individuals. Finally, we are examining whether the additional crossovers are mitotic or meiotic in origin by characterizing the degree to which increased levels of recombination arising from transposable element activation are clustered among siblings. 4043.

Present address. Maternal & Child Health Center, Aiiku Hospital, Tokyo, Japan 105-8321 The recent spread of Zika virus (Flaviviridae , Flavivirus, ZIKV) throughout the Americas has drawn worldwide attention due to the possible link to microcephaly in babies exposed in utero. ZIKV can infect the fetus during pregnancy by crossing the placenta or possibly by sexual transmission. Little is known about whether there is a critical time window of infection during pregnancy, particularly as there are data to suggest that syncytiotrophoblast from the mature placenta is resistant to flaviviruses. However , epidemiological analysis of the outbreaks in French Polynesia in 2014 and Brazil in 2015 strongly suggest that risk for microcephaly is associated with first trimester infections. Our hypothesis is that trophoblast from a mature placenta provides a stronger barrier to ZIKV than trophoblast differentiated from human embryonic stem cells (ESC), which are a possible model for the primitive placenta encountered at implantation. To address this question, we made use of RNAseq data generated from two model systems. The first consists of cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast generated in vitro from human term placenta. The second consists of the same populations, but derived from ESC by using BMP4 and two inhibitors of FGF2 and TGFB/ACTIVIN signaling to drive trophoblast differentiation. While the ESC-derived trophoblast express genes that encode the TAM surface receptors, TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK, implicated in ZIKV entry into cells, the placenta-derived cells show much lower expression. Conversely, the placenta-derived cells express more than 50 genes associated with the innate immune response system and anti-viral defense, while the ESC-derived cells express only a few. Techniques, including western blotting and immunohistochemistry confirmed these data at the protein level. Previously published data showed that the placenta-derived trophoblasts were not susceptible to ZIKV infection, while current data indicates that ESC-derived trophoblast are highly susceptible, even at very low titers. Additionally, the infected ESC-derived trophoblast released competent virus as determined by the ability of the culture supernatant to infect VERO cells. These data suggest that the developing fetus might be most vulnerable to ZIVK very early in pregnancy, before a protective zone of mature villous trophoblast has become established but when brain development is most vulnerable to disruption.

Spate, J. Benne, and S. Murphy. Division of Animal Sciences, University of Missouri; Columbia, MO Embryo mortality in mammals is greatest during the peri-implantation period, when the porcine conceptus undergoes elongation, establishment of pregnancy, and implantation. During this period, the porcine conceptus produces elevated levels of estrogens (E2). E2 is known to have a biological role as the signal for maternal recognition of pregnancy in the pig. E2 is up-regulated on Day 11 and 12 of pregnancy during the elongation from a tubular to a filamentous conceptus, where is it thought E2 and Interleukin 1 beta 2 (IL12) play a role. While estrogen's role during this time of pregnancy is generally understood, it is unknown whether estrogen has a direct function in early blastocyst development or an underlying biological role in elongation, development, establishment of pregnancy and implantation. To further evaluate estrogen's importance and to obtain any fundamental knowledge needed to improve reproductive efficiency and profitability , Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 nuclease genomic editing was utilized to edit Aromatase (CYP19A1) in order to conduct a loss-of-function study in pigs. For the CRIPSR/Cas9 method, guide RNAs (gRNA) were created to target exon 1 or 2 of the gene. The gRNA/Cas9 protein complex was transfected into pig fetal fibroblast cells in order to acquire cell lines with deletions in both alleles for one of the exons. 41Using validation through PCR and Sanger Sequencing, a cell line was established with a deletion in exon 2 and was used to create embryos with Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer (SCNT). Embryos were then cultured in vitro and collected on Day 7 after nuclear transfer. Number of cloned embryos that developed to blastocysts were recorded and were sequenced to confirm a biallelic edit in exon 2 of the aromatase gene. Results indicate that aromatase is not essential for early blastocyst development in vitro in the pig. Future studies will evaluate the role aromatase in conceptus elongation, establishment of pregnancy, and implantation. 45. (NO POSTER - ORAL PRESENTATION) Obesity-exposed Oocytes Accumulate and Transmit Damaged Mitochondria Due to an Inability to Activate Mitophagy. Anna L. Boudoures , Jessica Saben, PhD, Alysha Thompson, Andrea Drury, Wendy Zhang and Kelle H. Moley, MD. Center for Reproductive and Health Sciences, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO Maternal obesity results in predisposition of offspring to cardiometabolic syndrome, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Recent studies in mice suggest the defective metabolism and damaged mitochondria in the oocytes are responsible for the negative impacts maternal obesity confers on the offspring. Here, we tested the hypothesis that damaged mitochondria accumulate because oocytes are not capable of activating mitophagy, the cellular recycling of mitochondria via the autophagy pathway . In order to initiate high levels of mitophagy, we treated germinal for two hours. In somatic cell types, this is sufficient to induce mitophagy . Autophagosome formation depends on LC3B which co-localizes with mitochondria and increases during mitophagy . We used mice harboring a GFP-LC3B fusion protein to measure co- localization of the autophagosome with mitochondria. GV oocytes treated LC3-positive puncta, as observed by confocal microscopy. When fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome was prevented with BafilomyocinA1 (BafA1) during CCCP treatment, there was still clearance of puncta in oocytes. This indicates, oocytes eliminate LC3-positive puncta autophagosomes) in response to CCCP independent of the lysosome, rather than activating the typical mitophagy pathway. Alternately, in cumulus cells, LC3 was detected after CCCP treatment and increased when cells were treated with both BafA1 and CCCP together, suggesting mitophagy is activated normally in the cumulus cells. To support a lack of mitophagy in oocytes and mature eggs, mtDNA copy number did not change after 2h or 6h of CCCP treatment. Because oocytes do not activate mitophagy, we sought to determine if this effected the embryos of HF/HS mice, which come from eggs with defective mitochondria. Eggs from HF/HS mice used for in vitro fertilization generated blastocysts with lower mitochondrial activity, changes to cellular metabolism, and increased levels of Pink1, a protein critical for mitophagy initiation. This suggests embryos respond to inheritance of damaged mitochondria by activating mitophagy to clear the damage. In conclusion, oocytes do not activate mitophagy, which results in transmission of damaged mitochondria to embryos . 46. (NO POSTER - ORAL PRESENTATION) WNT Signaling Pathways of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, 2Columbia University, New York City, NY, 3 National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Research Triangle Park, NC Uterine fibroids are the most common pelvic neoplasms in women of reproductive age with severe morbidity and an economic burden exceeding that of breast cancer. Due to our poor understanding of their pathogenesis, current treatment options are limited and not fertility-sparing. Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand the underlying mechanisms involved in fibroid formation for better disease prevention and management. To address this need, we focused on the important but under-studied WNT pathways as regulators of cell proliferation and tissue architecture, which are characteristics of fibroids. Using healthy myometrial and fibroid tissues from patients (n=15), we discovered the expression of key non-canonical WNT (ncWNT) players, PRICKLE1 and DISHEVELLED1, were significantly ( P<0.05) lower in fibroids. Similarly, relevant target genes involved in tissue architecture were found to be dysregulated. Furthermore, upon silencing PRICKLE1 in myometrial cells expression of collagens, a hallmark of fibroids, were increased. To the contrary , in silico and ex vivo examination of CTNNB1, a signature component of canonical WNT (cWNT), 42showed lack of its nuclear localization with no significant changes in its target genes. W e next explored the regulatory mechanism involved in the lack of cWNT over-activation and ncWNT alteration in fibroids, Gene and protein expression analyses on ex vivo or in vitro cultured cells upon PRICKLE1 silencing or overexpression indicated that NAKED1 is upregulated in fibroids. Based on similar studies in rodents and flies, NAKED1 through DISHEVELLED can act as a switch in regulating the state of cWNT and ncWNT in fibroids. Lastly , we investigated the modulatory role of environmental estrogens on WNT pathways since these agents are risk factors for fibroids. Neonatal mice (n=6) were treated with 50 mg/kg genistein or 1 mg/kg diethylstilbestrol and uteri were collected on day 22. Results showed a pattern similar to human fibroids' in mice treated with environmental estrogens as compared to vehicle-treated mice. Taken together, our data suggest that WNT pathways are involved in fibroid pathogenesis and may be modulated by environmental estrogens. These findings for the first time link a major risk factor for fibroids to a crucial signaling pathway which can be targeted for therapeutic purposes.

The physiological pathways in the endometrium that mediate pregnancy success are not well understood. Beef heifers (n=270) were classified based on fertility using serial embryo transfer (4 rounds) to select animals with intrinsic differences in pregnancy loss. In each round, a single in vitro-produced embryo was transferred into heifers on day 7 post- estrus, and pregnancy determined on day 28 by ultrasound followed by pregnancy termination. Heifers were then classified based on pregnancy success as highly fertile (HF=100%), subfertile (SF=25-33%), or infertile (IF=0%). For Study 1, a single in vivo-produced embryo was transferred into HF (n=28), SF (n=17), and IF (n=11) heifers on day 7 post-estrus. Conceptuses were recovered from all heifers on day 14, and endometrial biopsies collected from the ipsilateral uterine horn. If present, conceptus length and area was determined. Conceptus recovery rate was not different (P=0.67) in the fertility-classified heifers. Conceptus length and area was also not different (P0.60). Total RNA was sequenced from the day 14 endometrial biopsies of pregnant fertility-classified heifers (n=5 per group). Many of the dif ferentially expressed mRNAs encoded proteins involved in immune responses or present in immune cells. In Study 2, fertility-classified heifers were resynchronized and received 2 in vivo-produced embryo on day 7 post-estrus. Heifers were slaughtered on day 17, and their uteri were flushed for the recovery of the conceptuses. RNA-seq data was generated from total RNA extracted from 17 conceptuses and day 17 endometrium of pregnant fertility-classified heifers encoded proteins involved in nutrient transport. Furthermore, substantial differences in gene expression were observed in the conceptuses that were collected from HF versus SF heifers. These results indicate that important biological mechanisms underlying subfertility manifest between days 14 and 17, period of maternal recognition of pregnancy in cattle.
