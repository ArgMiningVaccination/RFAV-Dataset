First of all what is the HPV vaccine? The two manufacturers of this vaccine are Merck & Co. who produce Gardasil, and GlaxoSmithKline who make Cervarix. The original intended use of this vaccine was to protect girls from 4 strains of the Human papillomavirus that have been classes as 'high risk'. High-risk HPVs may lead to abnormal changes in the cells. These changes are sometimes called dysplasia. Although dysplasia is not cancer, it's sometimes described as being pre-cancerous. There are however, more than 100 types of HPV. Around 40 types of HPV infection can affect the genital area. For the most part infection remains subclinical (i.e. no symptoms) or may cause physical symptoms such as genital warts. The ingredients are proteins of HPV Types 6, 11, 16, and 18, amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate, yeast protein, sodium chloride, L-histidine, polysorbate 80, sodium borate, and water for injection. Noted side effects seen in my practice So far what i have seen have been a similar set of symptoms in the girls. These include: *Extreme muscle pain *Migraines *Poor concentration and memory *Extreme Fatigue *Dizziness Nervousness and paranoia Insomnia Visual disturbances Alopecia Sudden outbursts of anger Increased sensitivity to light and darkness Increased sensitivity to temperature Aversion to noise, touch, movement Sensitivity to odours. Those starred are common to the majority to clients i have seen, but all of the above have been noted. When looking as to how to help these girls i am looking at layers of toxicity. I.E what is compromising their immune system so much as to cause these effects. One of the clues i am closely looking into is the link between aluminium poisoning and their symptoms. There is such a startling crossover of similarity of symptoms that it cannot be ignored. The NYU Medical Centre indicates as one of the common causes of aluminium poisoning is through frequent vaccination with aluminium adjuvants. But what does this mean? Aluminium is an odourless, lightweight, silvery-white metal and is the third most abundant metal in the earths crust. It is not found as a free metal in the environment but bound to other elements such as oxygen, silicon or fluorine that are commonly found in soil, minerals and rocks.Aluminium has a wide range of uses. It is used in materials for constructing buildings, packaging and containers for food and drinks, foil, vehicle body panels, engine and aircraft components and cooking utensils. Aluminium is also used in consumer products such as antacids, anti- ulcer drugs, antiperspirants and cosmetics and is present in food as a preservative. As well as, of course, vaccines.Although we are able to cope with a certain amount, there is a point which varies from person to person whereby metal toxicity causes many physical problems. A build up so to speak. So what can we do? My field of expertise is looking into detoxification through specific homeopathic protocols and these are often different from client to client as individual factors come into play. However the following remedies have proved useful so far: Nux Vomica Carcinocin Merc-viv Alumina The HPV vaccine as a homeopathic remedy (known as tautopathic prescribing) There is also something you can do alongside and this is called Chelation. This is a process by which we use substances to help 'carry' the metal(s) out the body often through the bowels. Some top natural chelating agents are: Amino acids Cilantro (known as Corriander in the UK) Activated Charcoal Onions and Garlic Chlorella High dose Vitamin C These on top of specific homeopathic remedies can make a huge difference to pain felt in the body. This article describes just part of the process in restoring health back to our girls (sadly now appearing in boys). The key, i am more and more convinced, is to detoxify the body from agents that have been making it very sick. This is not always an easy process but i am seeing that prescribing drugs to combat pain is not helping at all. Potentially it adds a further toxic layer to the case. "}
