A rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre a frequ\u00eancia de independentemente as Editado por Alan Ehrlich, MD, editor executivo da DynaMed e professor associado de Medicina Virg\u00ednia; Dan Randall, MD, editor adjunto da DynaMed; Nicole Jensen, MD, m\u00e9dica Practice Point: the newly FDA-approved maternal RSV vaccination at 24-36 weeks' gestation to prevent severe RSV infection in infants. EBM Pearl: Lack of transparency about whether an intention-to-treat or per-protocol analysis was done often suggests the latter, and demands a thorough review of appendices. The Pfizer respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine was recently approved for pregnant women in an effort to protect infants. The vaccine targets RSV surface glycoproteins from both RSV A and RSV B (therefore bivalent) and triggers the body to produce antibodies which prevent RSV fusion and infection in human cells. Vaccination during late pregnancy gives newborns passive immunity through the transfer of maternal antibodies, similar to Tdap and influenza vaccination. The FDA's decision was supported by an interim analysis of a phase 3 randomized control trial published in the NEJM. From June 2020 through October 2022, investigators randomized 7,392 healthy pregnant adults with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies at 24-36 weeks' gestation to one dose of RSV vaccine IM vs. placebo. RSV infection was monitored via weekly contact with parents of infants 6 months old and also with RT-PCR swabs for RSV collected during all visits for respiratory infections. The trial was conducted over four RSV seasons and infants were followed for up to 2 years. The primary efficacy outcomes were laboratory confirmed, medically-attended (i.e., seen by a healthcare provider) severe RSV and RSV of any severity within 90, 120, 150, and 180 days after birth. At the time of interim analysis, 77% of pregnant adults had given birth and 79% of infants had completed 6-month follow-up. Infants in the vaccinated group were significantly less likely to develop severe RSV infection at 6 months, with only 19 cases in the vaccinated group compared to 62 cases in the placebo group (0.5% vs. 1.85%, vaccine efficacy 69.4%, 97.58% CI, 44.3%-84.1%). RSV infection of any severity was also significantly lower in the vaccinated group at 6 months (1.6% vs. 3.4%). Additionally, fewer hospitalizations for RSV occurred in infants born to mothers in the vaccinated group. In terms of safety, maternal recipients of the vaccine experienced more local reactions, muscle pain, and headaches than in the placebo group. Otherwise, there were similar rates of serious adverse events in maternal and infant participants in both groups. Premature delivery rates were also similar, while a higher number of deaths occurred in infants born to mothers in the placebo group. We think the overall results are promising. One rub, however, is that the authors never specify whether they did an intention-to-treat or per-protocol analysis. After some digging into the supplementary data, we found language stating that evaluable participants had \"no major protocol violations\", strongly suggesting that a per-protocol analysis was done instead of the more conservative and preferred intention-to-treat. The confidence intervals were also wide and the generalizability is somewhat limited given the exclusion of adults with high-risk pregnancies. Despite these considerations, however, it appears the benefits of maternal vaccination outweigh the risks. We estimate an NNT of ~70 to prevent 1 case of severe RSV, though we will need the final analysis to confirm. For a potentially severe illness with no treatment other than supportive care, we are generally on board with vaccinating pregnant women.

[ Mining ](/corporations/industries/mining) \u2014 Subject Reference: [JAMA Netw Open. 2023 Mar 1;6(3):e235174](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36976556/) Practice Point: One to 2 days per week of walking at least 8,000 steps per day might be enough to decrease all-cause mortality. EBM Pearl: Hazard ratios are more appropriate than adjusted risk differences (aRDs) when analyzing time-dependent observational data. Getting people to exercise is a challenge. Common sense dictates that any exercise is better than none, but does the weekend warrior approach work? We still don't have good evidence on how many days per week one must walk to optimize long-term health. To that point, a recent study in JAMA looked at the association between days/week walked and all-cause mortality risk at 10 years. Researchers linked 2005/2006 NHANES data to the National Death Index through 2019 for 3,101 adult participants who wore an accelerometer for at least 4 days during the study period. Participants were categorized into groups based on the number of days (0, 1-2, and 3-7) they achieved 8,000 steps during the 1 week of accelerometer data collection and were evaluated for all-cause and CVD mortality. (That's correct \u2014 this whole study examining 10-year mortality trends is based on 1 week of self-reported data.) The dose-response association was also examined for the number of days/week participants achieved 8,000 steps and mortality. At 10 years, all-cause mortality risk was significantly lower among those who took 8,000 steps 1 to 2 days per week (adjusted risk difference [aRD] = -14.9%) and 3 to 7 days per week (aRD = -16.5%) on the absolute scale, compared with 0 days per week. Similarly, CVD mortality risk was 8.1% lower among those who took 8,000 steps 1 to 2 days a week and 8.4% lower in participants who took the steps 3 to 7 days. The relationship between walking frequency and mortality risk followed a curvilinear pattern, with a rapid decrease in risk up to 3 to 4 days of walking per week, after which the risk plateaued. So do we think walking 8,000 steps 1 or 2 days per week is sufficient to tack on a few extra years to your life? Maybe, but not necessarily based on this study due to a few important problems. The first is \"the chicken and the egg\" conundrum: when we observe a population, those who exercise are already healthier and more likely to live longer. This was not a randomized trial, and the initial observation was effectively looking at 3 different populations. Participants with a higher frequency of > 8,000-step-days at the beginning of the study tended to be younger, nonsmokers, less likely to have obesity or other medical conditions, and/or rate their health well, all factors known to be associated with better long-term health independent of activity level. Secondly, aRDs simply aren't the appropriate statistical tool to use here: HR's would have been better since they account for time-to-event, whereas aRDs quantify the absolute disparity in risk between the exposed and unexposed groups. We all know that correlation does not equal causation. These 3 groups seem to be fundamentally different which makes them hard to compare. It's also hard to say that 1 week of data is truly a reflection of step counts over the next 10 years. All that being said, there is likely little harm in recommending that our patients strive to get at least 8,000 steps once weekly. And citing this study to our patients might be a good sell to help get them moving.

Reference: [JAMA. 2023 May 23;329(20):1768-1777](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37219552/) Practice Point: Coronary calcium scores may be slightly better than pooled cohort equations for appropriately classifying risk of coronary heart disease, but that doesn't mean everyone should get a coronary CT. EBM Pearl: Area under the curve ( [AUC](https://towardsdatascience.com/illustrating-predictive-models-with-the-roc-curve-67e7b3aa8914)) is often used to display data for prediction tools. The graphical representation of the information can be worth a thousand words. The only thing worse than pooled cohort equations (PCE) such as the Framingham Risk Score or ASCVD calculator is a coronary calcium score (CCS). There, I said it. The thought behind coronary calcium scoring is that coronary artery calcium is a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis in healthy-appearing adults which can predict future clinical coronary heart disease (CHD), allowing the opportunity to intervene and potentially prevent major coronary events. However, the clinical utility of CCSs for patients with any score higher than zero has been consistently questioned in clinical studies. This hasn't stopped patients from wanting them or providers from ordering them, even if they aren't covered by insurance and the order in the EHR literally states \"CT heart cash-and-carry\" like it does at my institution. However, a study just published in JAMA makes a case for adding CCSs to PCEs to improve precision when estimating CHD risk. Coronary CTs for everyone, then? The authors took prospective cohort data from the MESA (n = 1991) and Rotterdam Studies (n = 1217) of White European adults (median age 65) without clinical CHD who were not on a statin and estimated participants' baseline 10-year CHD risk based on several PCEs, with and without a CCS. The median predicted 10-year CHD risk was 6-7%. Participants were followed for about 15 years for development of clinical CHD, which occurred in 8-9%. The primary outcome essentially measured whether adding the CCS to PCEs did a better job at classifying CHD risk. According to this study, it did. But we already knew that PCEs [overestimate](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27723890/) risk of CHD, so it's not all that surprising that CCS would improve the accuracy. Again I ask, coronary CTs for everyone, then? Please, no. First of all, let's be clear that a CCS is not recommended for anyone with established CHD. Second, a coronary CT isn't for people with acute anginal symptoms as it's not great at detecting coronary artery stenosis. Best case scenario, it's for people at low- to intermediate- CHD risk who for whatever reason are on the fence about a statin or need more motivation (than your advice) to eat healthier and exercise. And for what it's worth, those statin fence-sitters have a point, given they and 499 of their friends would need to take a statin daily for 5 years to prevent one more of their deaths. (The NNT for statins to prevent one cardiovascular death over 5 years is [500](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24149819/) for a person with a 10-year ASCVD risk of 10%, so it isn't the magic pill people think it is.) So if this study is telling us that adding CCS to PCEs slightly improves CHD risk classification, please forgive us if we say \"so what?\" A cath would help estimate CHD risk too, but that doesn't mean we should do it. Doing more coronary CTs would be one more example of overuse to do a slightly better job at (over)estimating CHD risk. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, maybe tell your patients to spend the money they would have spent on their cash-and-carry CT on a gym membership instead.

EBM Pearl: Don't mistake an \"insufficient\" evidence rating from the USPSTF for there not being any data. Sometimes there is plenty of data but a lack of proven clinical benefit due to problems with data or conflicting evidence. When an individual study fails to show a meaningful impact of an intervention, we often call the study \"negative,\" with the implication that the evidence is either a) sufficient and good enough quality to say that the intervention does not truly have an impact or b) the evidence isn't strong enough to draw a conclusion. The United States Preventative Service Task Force recently reviewed the evidence on skin cancer screening and [reaffirmed](https://go.ebsco.com/Njg5LUxOUS04NTUAAAGMOucb8EMmsqqGEYuDGpCVPdJ9rnyiObfkPH49WmPGbfbfg-iooX82kS5TkEu9FIR3lqRCQiw=) their \"I\" grade for insufficient evidence to recommend for or against this practice. How can this be? Skin cancer is very common, and although its most dangerous form (melanoma) represents only 1% of skin cancer, it accounts for the majority of skin cancer deaths and is usually recognizable when seen. Not only that, but the screening itself basically only requires a clinician to look at an unclothed patient, and diagnosis and treatment of early stage melanoma has a far better prognosis than metastatic disease. So why isn't screening for skin cancer a no-brainer? The Task Force lists several possible reasons for a recommendation to be given an \"I\" grade, including lack of evidence, poor quality evidence, and conflicting evidence. In this case, the \"I\" recommendation is related to conflicting evidence. When we think about conditions that are good candidates for screening, a \"critical point\" is necessary at which the condition (cancer) can be identified before symptoms present in time to make a difference in outcomes. Because melanoma is a fast-growing cancer, it may lack this critical point, leading to the possibility of an \"interval\" cancer that develops between screenings. These \"interval\" cancers were a significant factor in a nationwide screening campaign conducted by Germany in the early 2000's which influenced the USPSTF's \"I\" recommendation, wherein all Germans were eligible for a free total body skin exam conducted by trained clinicians every two years. During that program, which had almost 1 \u00bd million participants and lasted over six years, more skin cancers were detected in participants but skin cancer mortality did not go down. In fact, melanoma mortality rates rose faster than for other European countries during this time period. As it turned out, most of the melanomas detected in the screening group were found by patients themselves during the interval phase. The German data could be interpreted as being inadequate - perhaps screening exams should be more frequent than every two years - but it also could be interpreted as evidence against one of our basic assumptions about screening for cancer: that early detection saves lives. There have been many ideas in medicine that seemed to make sense but turned out to have the opposite effect of what was hoped for. This is due to the fact that when we think mechanistically, we are not always aware of all of the mechanisms at work. Thus there is no substitute for data that provides hard clinical outcomes, such as mortality. Other prior \"I\" grade recommendations have been changed when technology advanced, such as low-dose CT for lung cancer screening. But when clinical examination methods to identify early skin cancer are already pretty good, we may wonder how a new or different diagnostic modality could shift the recommendation. One possibility: artificial intelligence (AI). It may come as no surprise that there is [a race](https://go.ebsco.com/Njg5LUxOUS04NTUAAAGMOucb8KwQCNReESbZmSZSgrYdqyul5Ok4G2n_Pn4rF62VKvCiH9oq70OOskI-_0SSBNpmI2A=) to figure out how to utilize AI to identify concerning skin lesions. Neither the \"ABCDE'' nor the \"Ugly Duckling\" rules are that hard to learn. If AI can be quick/sensitive/accurate/cheap, trained assistants could facilitate screening at shorter intervals and flag patients who might benefit from a closer look by dermatologists. AI is being developed for this right now - if this is successful and skin cancer screening becomes widely available at shorter intervals, we will need to keep an eye not just on the number of skin cancers detected, but for the hoped-for mortality reduction. For now, however, there is insufficient evidence to routinely screen for skin cancer in those at average risk.
