To date, the role of miR-605 in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has not been investigated. We recently showed the decrease of circulating mi R-605 in serum of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patie nts who responded to VEGF The current study was designed to inves tigate the expression of miR-605 and understand the mechanism(s ) responsible the extracellular release of miR-605 u sing RCC cells. Methods: 786-0 cells were treated with and without vorinostat for 24h an d condition media were collected, briefly centrifuged to settle the cells and debris, and processed to isolate exosomes using the ExoQuick exosome isolation kit (Systems Biology, CA). Purified exosomes and 786-0 cells were used to isolate RNA and further p repared cDNA to utilize for quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Expression of miR-605 in exos omes and cells was determined using TaqMan MicroRNA Assays with miR-605 primers obtained from Applied Bi osystems, NY. To determine the role of secretory protein 24 family member D (SEC24D), a catalytic component of coat prot ein complex (COPII) involved in the s ecretory pathway, 786-0 cells treated with vor inostat were us ed to determine SEC24D expression by QRT-PCR and Western blot analys is. TCGA data was used to determine correlation of SEC24D expression clear cell r enal cell carcinoma patients' survival. Results: Vorinostat treatment resulted in a significant decrease of miR- 605 expression in exosomes and increas e (100 fold) of intracellular expression. Furthermore, the increased intracellular miR-605 was associated with the inhibition of SEC24D mRNA and protein ex pression in 786-0 cells treated with vorinostat. Canc er analysis reveale d the ov erall survival of ccRCC patients with alteration of SEC24D. Conclusion: Taken together, our preliminary data suggest that the vorinostat in These results suggest that vorinostat treatment retained intracellular miR-605 that target genes involved in cell surv ival and proliferation in RCC. Further studies will evaluate circula ting miR-605 as a predictive biomarker to determine the efficacy of vorinostat in ongoing tr ials with RCC patients. Basic Science FacultyPOSTER #2 ESTABLISHING A NOVEL PERITONEAL CARCINOMATOSIS MOUSE MODEL FOR Indiana University School Of Medicine-South Bend, South Bend, IN 2 Indiana University Health Goshen Center For Cancer Care, South Bend, IN Email: hassansa@iu.edu Background: Esophageal adenocarci noma (EAC) has become the pred ominant type of esophageal cancer in United States. Overall 5 year sur vival rate of EAC is below 20% and most patients present with locally advanced or widespread metastatic disease, where current treatm ent is largely ineffective. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Improvement of esop hageal adenocarcinoma patient outcome requires well-characterized anima l models in whichto evaluate n ovel therapeutics. In this study we aimed to establish a peritoneal dissemination esophageal adenocarcinoma xenografts mouse model that would support survival outcome analyses. Methods: To find the best candidate cell line from 7 esophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines of various origin, we injected them intraperitoneal ly and subcutaneously into seve re combined immunodefi ciency (SCID) mice and examined the tumor progressi on and survival outcomes. Human esophageal adenocarcinoma cell cardia/ were injected intraperitoneally/subcutaneously into SCID mice. The peritoneal /xenograft tumor formation and mouse survival were compared among different groups. Results: All cell lines injected subcutaneously formed tumors w ithin 3 months at variab le rates. All cell lines except OACM5.1C formed intraperitoneal tumors within 3 months a t variable rates. Mean animal survival with peritoneal dissemination was 108 days for ESO26 cells (5X1 06), 50 days for OE33 cells (5X106), 88 days for ESO51 cells (5X106), 76 days for SK-GT-2 cells (5X106), 55 days for OE19 cells (5X106), 45 days for OE19 cells (10X106) and 82 days for Flo-1 cells (5X106). Interestingly, all mice injected with OE19 5X106 and 5/5, 10X106)had bloody ascites implants at the gastric card ia, porta hepatis and liver. The mean survival time of these animals was significantl y shorter (45 days for 10X106 cells). Conclusion: Peritoneal esophageal adenocarcinoma xenografts wer e successfully established after intraperitoneal injection of OE19 cells and this animal model o f peritoneal dissemination for survival outcome will provide a useful survival outcome assessment model for eva luation of cancer therapeutics in experimental esophageal ade nocarcinoma. Basic Science FacultyPOSTER #3 TO QUANTIFY A DNA PHOTOLESION POTENTIALLY INVOLVED IN SKIN CANC ER IMMUNOASSAY Lei Li1, IU School Of Medicine, Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, IU School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 2 Chemistry & Chemical Biol ogy, IUPUI, Indianapolis, IN Email: lilei@iupui.edu The dominant DNA photo-damage product detected in UV irradiated bacterial endospores is 5-thyminyl-5,6-dihydro thymine, which is commonly referred to as the spore photoproduct (SP). SP accounts for > 95% DNA photolesion formed in UV irradiated spor es; its formation in other species including humans has not been investigated mainly due to the la ck of effective SP analysis means. Moreover, it requires 14 steps to chemically synthesize SP whic h is needed as the standard for SP analysis; such a lengthy synthesis represents an almost insurmo untable barrier preventing a biological laboratory fr om conducting SP studies. Taking advantage of our strong synthetic ability, we have carri ed out the SP synthesis. Moreover, using tri-deuter ium labeled dinucleotide d3-TpT, we prepared the d3-SP via solid state photoreaction. After digesting the genomic DNA using an enzyme cocktail, we added a known amount of d3-SP as an internal standard to the DNA digest, which allows us to reliably quantify the unlabeled SP formed in the genomic DN A of UV irradiated keratin ocytes and skin tissues via HPLC/MS assay using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Our results indicate that SPs may account for as many as 10% of total thymine dimers formed in th e human skin. Considering that SP was implied to be highly mutagenic, our data suggest that SP ma y be an important player in the development of skin cancer. To further facilitate the SP photobiology studies, we conjugate d an SP-containing oligonucleotide to a carrier protein again via chemical synthes is. We then used the oligonucleotide- protein conjugate as the antigen fo r mouse immunization to prod uce a monoclonal SP antibody. Our ELISA results show that our antibody is highly specific to SP, which opens the door for SP in situ studies via immunoassays including isolation of SP-containing D NA fragments by immunoprecipitation, which then enables the elucidation of SP f ormation sites in the human genome via high throughput sequencing. Such studies, when coupled with the bioinformatics analysis of the mutational data obtained from skin cancer patients, may allow u s to reveal the exact roles of SP in the induction of skin cancer. Furthermore, the LC/MS assay and antibody-based immunoassay dev eloped for SP studies represent a general approach for the analysis of any given DNA lesion. Because mutations induced by DNA lesions are the major c ause for cancer development, our research here may provide a general methodology to the field for the investigation of other DNA lesions. Basic Science FacultyPOSTER #4 TLR9 IS INDISPENSABLE FOR MR1 -MEDIATED BACTERIAL Jianyun Liu1, Randy Immunology, Indianapolis, jealiu@iupui.edu Mucosal-associated innate T (MAIT) cells are conserved T cells that express a semi-invariant T cell receptor (TCR; Va7.2 in human and Va19 in mice). The developmen t of MAIT cells requires the antigen (Ag) presenting major hi stocompatibility complex (MHC)- related molecule, MR1, as well as commensal bacteria, because germ- free or MR1-deficient animals have few MAIT cells. B cells were the first identified (and the most prominent) antigen pres enting cells (APCs) for MAIT cells. Previous studies have shown that MR1 is ubiquitously expressed, but is mostly localized in the cytosol. B cells normally expre ss very few MR1 molecules on the cell surface. Upon a bacterial infection, MR1 translocates to cell surface with loaded Ag, int eracts with the invariant TCRa and activates MAIT cells. However, it remains unknown how MR1 molec ules are processed and loaded with bacterial Ag in APCs. We have found that treating B cells with a TLR9 agonist CpG increases MR1 surface expression. The upregulation of MR1 was blo cked by protein transport inhibitor Brefeldin A, suggesting that endocytic trafficking st imulated by TLR9 activation is important for the surface expression of MR1 in B cells. Further, knocking -down TLR9 expression by shRNA reduces MR1-mediated activation of MAIT cells. Overall, our res ults indicate that TLR9 is important for MR1-mediated bacterial Ag pr esentation. Further studies are needed to elucidate how TLR9 controls MR1 endocytic traffick ing and bacterial Ag processing and/or loading onto MR1. Basic Science FacultyPOSTER #5 NOVEL BIOMARKERS AND MOLECULAR ALTERATIONS FOR BREAST Medicine, Indiana Unive rsity School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 2 Susan G. Komen Tissue Bank At The IU Simon Cancer Center, Indianapolis, IN 3 Department Of Medical And Molecu lar Genetics, Indiana University Sc hool Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN Email: marinon@iu.edu Background : Despite significant advances in diagnosis and treatment, brea st cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide. Therefore, th ere is a critical need to identify molecular mechanisms responsible for c ancer initiation and progression. To date, there have been attempts to identify biomarkers that c an predict progression of pre-malignant lesions (i.e. DCIS) to invasive carcinom a. Our study aims to identify e arliest markers of br east cancer initiation. Methods: We evaluated local (breast tissue) and systemic (serum/plasma) molecular alterations associated with breast cancer susceptibility using the unique r esources available at the Komen Normal Tissue Bank at IUSCC. Human specimens (serum/plasma and breast tissue) donated by women before their cancer was cl inically detectable were used t o identify circulating biomarkers that are associated with breast cancer risk. Specimens from age-matc hed controls were used for comparison.Sera/plasma were anal yzed for circulating miRNAs and telomeric the circulating DNA (cfDNA). We empl oyed next generation sequencing to obtain transcriptome in the \"normal\" breast of women who even tually developed breast cancer and age-matched control normal breast. Results/Discussion: Serum/plasma of women who deve loped breast cancer showed varia tion in circulating miRNAs as well as tel omeric cfDNA levels as compare d to the healthy control group. Among 385 microRNAs detected in circulation, 10 miRNAs were pre sent at different levels in the susceptible group. In addition, susceptible group displayed red uced levels of plasma telomeric cfDNA and telomere shorte of microdissected breast epithelium and stroma revealed molecular alterations in the \"normal\" breas t tissue associated with cance r development. Preliminary data suggest inflammatory response, t ranscription regulation and lip id metabolism as major mechanisms associated with breast cancer initiation. Conclusion/Impact: Functional analysis of biomarke rs identified in this study may help in cancer risk assessment and improve ment of preventive therapy. Basic Science FacultyPOSTER #6 ALTERATION OF WARBURG METABOLISM AND NF-KB SIGNALING ENHANCES PANCREATIC CANCER X-RAY SENSITIVITY Marc S Mendonca1, Chin-Sinex2, Jacqueline Jeremy Sherer2, Adriana Saldan2, Stephanie Metcalf2 1 Radiation Oncology, Medical And Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School Of Medicine, IUPUI, Indianapolis, IN 2 Radiation Oncology, Indiana Universi ty School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN Email: mmendonc@iupui.edu Pancreatic cancer has a survival rate of less than 5% five year s after diagnosis. Treatment for pancreatic cancer consists of surgery, chem otherapy, and radiation therapy . Despite this multimodality approach local regional reoccurrence of pancrea tic cancer is common. In many c ases pancreatic cancer recurrence is due to the therapeutic resistance of pancreatic cancer cells. While th e genetics of pancreatic c a n c e r s a r e h i g h l y complex, about 90% of all pancre atic cancers exhibit a constitu tively active KRAS oncogene. Common characteristics of this mutati on are constitutive activation of the pro-survival transcription factor while PDH kinase causes the shift commonly seen in cancer metab olism to aerobic glycolysis (Warburg metabolism). We hypothesized that by blocking the pro-survival signals from NF-kB with the inhibitor Dimethylamino-parthenolide (DMAPT ) and by shifting the metaboli sm from Warburg metabolism back to oxidative metabolism by using Dic hloroacetate (DCA that we can increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy in treating pancreatic carcinomas clinically. This stud y examined the effectiveness of DMAPT and DCA to induce cytotoxicity and increase radiation-induced cell killing in human pancreatic cancer cells AsPc-1, BxPc-3, and MIA PaCa-2. We found that dual treatment of the three pancreatic cancer cell lines: altered Warburg metabolism; decreased cell viability; did not s ignificantly alter cell cycle distribution and increased radiation-induced ce ll killing after single and fract ionated doses through inhibition of split dose repair. In summary, we have esta blished that dual treatment wit h DMAPT and DCA is not only cytotoxic to pancreatic cancer cells but als o significantly enhances radiati on-induced cell killing of human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. Basic Science FacultyPOSTER #7 MOLECULAR INSIGHTS OF PATHWAYS R ESULTING FROM TWO COMMON PIK3CA MUTATIONS IN BREAST CANCER Poornima Nakshatri1 1 ( PI3K) i n ~70% of breast cancers. PIK3CA gene mutations or am plifications that a ffect the PI3K p110a sub unit account for activation of this pathway in 20-40% of cases, par ticularly in estrogen-receptor a lpha (ERa)-positive breast cancers. AKT family of kinases, AKT1-3, ar e the downstream targets of PI 3K and these kinases activate ERa. Although several inhibitors of PI 3K have been developed, none h as proven effective in the clinic, partly due to an incomplete unde rstanding of the selective rout ing of PI3K signaling to specific AKT isoforms. Accordingly, we inves tigated in this study the contri bution of specific AKT isoforms in connecting PI3K activation to E Ra signaling, and we also assess ed the utility of using the components of PI3K-AKT isoform-ERa signaling axis as predictive biomarkers of response to PI3K inhibitors. Using a variety of physiologically relevant model s ystems with defined natural or knock- in PIK3CA mutations and/or PI3K hyperactivation, we show that P IK3CA-E545K mutations (found in ~20% of PIK3CA-mutant breast cancers), but not PIK3CA-H1047R mutations (found in 55% of PIK3CA-mutant breast cancers), preferentially activate AKT1. Ou r findings argue that AKT1 signaling is needed to respond to estrogen and PI3K inhibitors in breast cancer cells with PIK3CA- E545K mutation, but not in breast cancer cells with other PIK3C A mutations. This study offers evidence that personalizing treatment of ER-positive breast can cers to PI3K inhibitor therapy may benefit from an analysis PIK 3CA-E545K-AKT1-estrogen signalin g pathways. Basic Science FacultyPOSTER #8 ROLE OF GFI1 TRANSCRIPTION FACT OR IN AND Petrusca1, Indianapolis, IN 2 Rodebush VA, Indianapolis, IN Email: dpetrusc@iu.edu Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy that is curre ntly incurable for the overwhelming majority of patients. We reported that MM cells in duce expression of the transcriptional repressor, Growth independent factor 1 (Gfi1), in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) that results in prolonged suppression of osteoblast differentiation by repressing transcription of the Runx2 gene. Since Gfi1 is an anti-apoptotic factor in other hematolo gic malignancies, we hypothesized that Gfi1 has an important pro-su rvival role in MM cells by blocking apoptosis and regulating MM cell growth and survival. CD138+ cells isolated from MM patients and healthy donors and human MM cell lines were tested for Gfi1 expression levels and the effects of Gfi1 knock down (KD) on MM cell survival by transduction with pLKO.1-puro lentivirus vectors en coding characteriz ed HDAC inhibitor enrichment at the Noxa , PUMA and p21gene promoters by ChIP assays and the effects on acetylation of Gfi1 on its p53 binding capacity in MM cells tre ated withtrichostatin A and nicotinamide. We found that Gfi1 is highly expressed, at the mRNA and protein level, in CD138 + cells from MM patients and MM cell lines compared with CD138+ cells from normal donors. Gfi1 expression was further increased in MM cells by exogenous IL-6, TNFa and sphingosine-1- phosphate (S1P). KD of Gfi1 inhibited the growth and induced apoptosis of MM cells, as measured by increased mRNA Bax, PUMA , Noxa , increased cleaved 3 levels of Mcl-1 and c-Myc. Gfi1's inhibition of apoptosis resulted in part binding of Gfi1 to p53 which bl ocked p53's access to its pro- apoptotic targets promoters. HDACi treatment inhibited Gfi1's suppression of apoptosis by acetylation of Gfi1 at the K292 residue, which prevented Gfi1-p 53 binding and subsequent enrichment of p53 at Noxa , PUMA and p21 promoters in MM cells. CD138+ cells from MM patients also showed increased levels of SphK1 mRNA compared with normal donors and SphK1 mRNA levels and protein activity were further increased in MM cells by exogenous IL-6 and S1P. Further, direct co-culture of MM cells with BMSC enhanced Gfi1,IL6 (3 fold) and SphK1 (2.5 fold) mRNA levels in MM cells. Importantly, Gfi1 KD in MM cells profoundly downregulated SphK1 mRNA levels and reduced expression of phospho-SphK1, suggesting that Gfi1 enhances MM growth in part via increasing expression and activity of SphK1. Taken together, our results suggest that Gfi1 may act as a key regulator of MM growth and survival through its regulation of p53 and SphK1 activity, and that targeting Gfi1 may be a novel therapeutic stra tegy for MM patients. Basic Science FacultyPOSTER Kaplan1 1 Indiana University School Of Medici ne, Indianapolis, IN, Indianapolis, IN 2 Rutgers-Robert Wood Johnson Medical, New Brunswick, NJ, , NJ Email: aramadan@iupui.edu As one of the most validated immunotherapies to date, allogenei c hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a potentially curative option for high-risk hematological malignancies, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The im munotherapeutic of allo-HCT is known as the graft- vs-leukemia (GVL) activity. Howe ver, GVL activity is often accompanied by T-cell reactivity to allo-antigens in normal hos t tissues, which leads to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), another major cause of death after HCT. Therefore, there is a great unmet need to improve the current process of a llo-HCT through increasing the GVL activity and decreasing GVHD. We have shown that an ele vated plasma level of soluble (s)ST2 in HCT patients is a risk factor for severe GVHD . ST2 blockade reduces sST2-producing T cells while maintaining protective membrane (m )ST2-expressing T cells s u c h a s t y p e 2 T c e l l s a n d r e g u l a t o r y T c e l l s d u r i n g a G V H D .

Interestingly, we found that addition of IL-33 duri ng T9 differentiation (T9 IL-33) increased expression of and PU.1, a transcription factor t hat promotes IL-9 production in both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Adoptive transfer of T9 IL-33 cells with bone marrow cells in a murine model of HCT r esulted in less severe GVHD com pared to transfer of T9IL-33 cells generated from ST2-/- or IL-9-/- T cells. Furthermore, cytolytic molecules implicated in anti-leukemic activity (granzyme B and perforin) were upregulated in WT T9IL-33 cells IL-33 cells did WT T9 IL-33 cells also exhibited higher anti- cultured with a retrovirally cells in adoptive transfer of T9 IL-33 cells resulted in increased survival compared to syngeneic mice, allo-HCT mice transferred with T1 cells, or T9 cells or T9 IL-33 cells generated from ST2-/- o r I L - 9-/- T cells. Human T9 cells are poorly studied. Here we demonstrate that IL-33 has the same impact on human T cells thr ough enhancing IL-9 and Granzyme B production compared to T9 cells as well as demonstra ted higher in vitro anti- leukemic with tumor cell line was upregulated in WT cells, and blockade with IL-33, and human T9 IL-33 cells as compared to the cell blocked with isotype control, suggesting that CD8a was associated with M HC-restricted cytolytic activity in T9 IL-33 cells. Altogether, our observations demonstrated that adoptive transfer of T9IL-33 cells represents a promising c ellular therap y following HCT. Basic Science FacultyPOSTER #10 TARGETING THE MDM2-AKT SIGNALIN G NETWORK IN COMBINATION WITH TEMOZOLOMIDE IMPROVES EFFICACY IN ECTOPIC AND ORTHOTOPIC Shannon1, Aaron Cohen Gadol2 1 Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN 2 Goodman Campbell Brain And Spine, Indianapolis, IN Email: msaadatz@iu.edu An elusive goal in the treatment of patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the development of therapeutic strategies that prev ent emergence of therapy-resist ant tumor cells. Our labo ratory has identified a novel combination therapy that t argets the Akt-Mdm2 signaling n etwork in the context of genotoxic temozolomide (TMZ) therapy. Inhibitors were specifically select ed based on structural properties related to blood-brain barrier permeability, and pharmacokinetic profiles of plasma, normal brain, flank/ectopic brain tumors, and intracranial tumors. Isobolograms and combination i ndices indicated that Akt (GDC0068) and Mdm2 (RG7112) inhibitors either together or in combination with TMZ, resulted in synergistic inhibition of cell growth in both mtp53 and wt53 GBM primary patient cell lin es (GBM10, GBM43, and MHBT32). When RG7112 and GDC0068 (at a of 0.5:1) were combined with TMZ , strong synergism was evident at multiple dose-ratios. As downstream measures of blocking Akt an d Mdm2, activation of the Forkhead box O-class 1/3a (FoxO) transcripti on factors and increased p53/p73 proteins were evident following TMZ+RG7112+GDC0068. For in vivo studies, an intermittent dosing regimen of TMZ+RG7112+GDC0068 was developed to avoid normal tissue toxicity. Mice with TMZ-re sistant GBM43 ectopic tumors were treated 3 \u00d7 weekly for 3 weeks. Combination of TMZ+RG7112+GDC0068 signi ficantly delayed tumor progression compared to other treatments (n=8-9 per group, p < 0.05). TMZ+G DC0068 and TMZ+RG7112+GDC0068 significantly reduced tumor volume relative to TMZ, and on the last day with surviving TMZ+GDC0068- treated mice (2500 mm3 endpoint), tumor volumes were significan tly reduced in TMZ+RG7112+GDC0068 compared to TMZ+GDC0068 (p<0.05). In mice with GBM43 intracrani al tumors, survival was significantly increased by GDC0068+RG7112 (13 days), and further increased by TMZ+RG7112+GDC0068 (24 days) compared to TMZ alone. These data suggest that blocking the Mdm 2-Akt signaling network in the context of TMZ-mediated DNA damage holds th erapeutic promise. Studies to i dentify mechanism and appropriate biomarkers of response are in progress.

The mec hanisms mediating this long-term osteoblast (OB) suppression are poorly understood. We hypothesized that MM cells induce epigenetic changes at the Runx2 promoter in preOB bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC). trated that Gfi1, a transcriptional repressor of Runx2 that is induced in BMSC by MM, directly binds to the Runx2 promoter, recruiting chromatin corepressors and inducing epigenetic repression of Runx2 in preOB, thereby prevent ing OB differentiation. We reported that p62 (sequestosome-1) in BMSC is critical for t he formation of MM-induced signaling complexes that mediate OB suppr ession, and found that an inhibi tor of ZZ domai preOB. In vivo, XRK3F2 induced new bone formation and remodeling in the presence of high tumor burden w ithout altering bones without tumor. We tested if XRK3F2 prevents the Gfi1-mediated epigenetic suppr ession of Runx2 MM exposure of murine preOB exposed to and that XRK3F2 both prevents and reverses Gfi1 upregulation . Importantly, long-term culture o f primary MM patient BMSC with XRK3F2 increased acetylation at the Runx2 promoter, allowing rescued os teogenic differentiation and miner al deposition. We conclude that XRK3F2 blocks MM-induced signaling, reducing recruitment of Gfi1 and its corepressor HDAC1 to the Runx2 promoter, and preventing MM -induced epigenetic suppression of Runx2 . These results suggest that targeting p62-ZZ as a therapeutic strategy in MM m ay reverse Gfi1 upregulation, rescuing MM- induced epigenetic suppression of Runx2 in BMSC and healing MM bone lesions.

CIPN is frequently associated with pain tha t significantly impairs the quality of life and work capability of canc er patients. Use of oxaliplatin for colo rectal cancer is associated with a unique cold- sensitive acute pain in addition to the chronic pain, which is also seen for other CIPN-causing drugs. The objective of this work was to study the membrane excitability mechanisms contributing to acute and chronic pain caused by oxaliplat in in peripheral sens ory neurons locate d at dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Methods: The acute effects of oxa liplatin were studied by acute application of oxaliplatin to DRG neurons dissociated from adult C57BL/6 mice. To study the chronic effec ts of oxaliplatin, a total of four injections of oxaliplatin over one week were gi ven to adult Sprague-Dawley ra ts. One week after the last injection, DRG neurons were dissociated. For both mouse and rat studied, small DRG neurons, most of them are nociceptive, were chosen for whole-cell patch clamp recording. Membrane exci tability was recorded in current-clamp mode. Results: Both acute and chronic treatment of oxaliplatin increa sed membrane excita bility of small DRG neurons. Acute treatment depolarized the membrane potential, decreased the action potential threshold, and increased action potential number s. The effects of acute treatm ent were completely reversed by retigabine, a FDA approved anti-epileptic drug and a KCNQ/M channel opener. I n contrast to acute treatment, chronic treatment did not change resting membrane potential. However, c hronic treatment decreased the voltage threshold of action potentials and caused spontaneous firing of action potentials that was not seen in control groups. Conclusions: Depolari zation of membrane potential of nociceptiv e DRG neurons might contribute to acute pain caused by oxaliplatin. Retig abine might reverse oxaliplati n-caused acute pain by hyperpolarization of membrane potential of nociceptive DRG neurons. Decreased voltag e threshold of action potentials, which may be caused by sensitized threshold sodium channels, might contribute to the chronic pain caused by oxaliplatin treatment. Targeting membrane depolarization and th reshold sodium channels might be a useful strategy to treat oxaliplatin-i nduced acute and c hronic pain, r espectively.

Using a mouse model of human breast can cer bone metastases (MDA-MB- 231) we have shown that bone-derived TGF-\u00df, released as a resul t of tumor-induced osteolysis is responsible for skeletal muscle weakness. Weakness is due to an increase in oxidation of skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor/calci um release channel (RyR1) NA DPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) leading to sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium leak. To determine if similar bone-muscle interactions were evident i n immune competent mice with tumor-induced bone destruction, we tested muscle function in th e 4T1 mouse model of breast cancer in bone. 4T1 cells injected directly into the tibia of B alb/C mice led to osteolytic bone destruction, weakness and cachexia. In vivo f at and lean content were decreased in mice with 4T1 osteolytic cancer in bone. Fore limb grip strength was reduced a nd ex vivo contractility of the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle showed a significant red uction in specific f o rc e i n t umo r bearing mice compared with non-tumor bearing controls. Ex vivo force measurements, biochemistry, and gene expression, w ere performed on muscle con tralateral from the tumor-bearing limb to avoid interference from tumor infiltration and to deter mine if these effects were systemic. Biochemical analysis revealed that RyR1 on the SR, a key protei n involved in skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling, was oxidized and depleted of t he stabilizing subunit, calstabin1. SMAD3 phosphorylation was increased in muscle from mice with 4T 1 osteolytic cancer in bone, suggesting a role for TGF-\u00df. Nox4 is a TGF-\u00df target and a const itutively active source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in muscle.

Basic Science FacultyPOSTER #14 ANDROGEN RECEPTOR EXPRESSION IS ASSOCIATED WI TH SUNITINIB RESISTANCE IN RENAL CELL CARCINOMA MODELS Remi Adelaiye-Ogala1 1 Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis IN, Roswell Park Cancer Institute Division, University At Buffalo, Buffalo NY, Indianapolis, IN Email: radelaiy@iu.edu Background: Androgen receptor (AR) expression has been reported in renal c ell carcinoma but its biological role remains elusive. Sunitinib is a potent anti-angiogenic dru g approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, e ventually RCC tumors develop dr ug resistance. We have hypothesized that tumor cells resistance to sunitinib is associated with kinome r eprograming and anti-apoptotic genes upregulation. To date, there is no report on the association be tween AR expression and re sistance to TKI such as sunitinib in RCC. Our study was designed to investigate the role of AR in sunitinib resistance in RCC. We used our previously reported sun itinib resistant ccRCC cells a nd patient 2 were utilized to determine sens itivity or resistance to sunitin ib. Patient derived xenograft (PDX) models of advance and metastatic RCC and RCC cell lines, sensitive and re sistant tumors were used to detect AR expression by qRT-PCR, immunohist ochemistry and Western blot an alysis. Reverse phase protein array (RPPA) was used to assess 249 protein including AR in sunitinib sensitive and resistant tumors. Results: Our qRT-PCR data showed an increase by 1000 folds in mRNA levels of AR in our sunitinib resistant cell lines. Similarly, RPPA data revealed AR to be increased in sunitinib r esistant RCC PDX tumors. This observation was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Conclusion: Overall our data suggest the potential role of AR and its association with resistance to sunitinib. Ongoing studies are t esting the in vitro a n d in vivo combination treatment of RCC models wit h sunitinib and AR antagonists. Basic Science Graduate StudentPOSTER #15 THE ROLE OF WNT5A SIGNALING PATH WAY IN EPITHELIAL OVARIAN CANCE R PROGRESSION Marwa Asem1,2, Rebecca Burkhalter, Sharon Stack1,2 1 Chemistry And Biochemistry, Notre Dame, South Bend, IN 2 Harper Cancer Research Institute, South Bend, IN Email: masem@nd.edu Ovarian cancer (OvCa) is the fifth leading cause of cancer deat h among US women and has the highest mortality rate of all the gynecologic tumors. Unlike other canc ers, OvCa rarely metas tasizes hematogenously. Instead, the transformed ovaria n epithelial cells disseminate f rom the primary site into the peritoneal cavity in f o r m o f s i n g l e c e l l s o r m u l t i c e llular aggregates. The peritone al fluid facilitates th e attachment of the disseminating cells to peritoneum and omentum, where they estab lish their metastatic sites. WNT5A is a non-canonical WNT ligand that is critical in normal development. WNT5A binds to different receptors and activates several downstream signaling pathways t hat regulate cell growth, polarity, differentiation and migration. In cancer, WNT5A can act as a tumor suppressor or an oncogene. The role o f WNT5A in OvCa is still questionable, as some studies show that WNT5A induces ovarian cancer progression, while other studies state that WNT5A is a tumor suppressor that induces senescence in ovarian cancer cells. Besides the contradicting data about WNT5A in ovarian cancer, its activated pathways and mechanisms in ovarian cancer cells are largely unknown. In this study, we aim to elucidate the roles played by WNT5A in epithelial ovarian canc er cells and explore its activated pathways. In our data, we show the presence of high levels of WNT5A in ascites from ovarian cancer patients with advanced stages. We also used human ovaria n epithelial cell lines OVCAR3, OVCAR5 and OVCAR8 that have different endogenous levels of WNT5A and i ts binding receptors. WNT5A induces ovarian cancer cells invasion in trans-well invasion assay. WN T5A also induces the formation of filopodia in ovarian cancer cells, which is a n important event in ovarian ca ncer cell migration. Moreover, WNT5A signaling regulates the expression of genes correlated with met abolism, inflammation and invasion. Overall, our data suggests that WNT5A plays an oncogenic role i n epithelial ovarian cancer cells. More experiments exploring WNT5A activ ated pathways and effects in e pithelial ovarian cancer cells are underway.

Muscle wasting reduces quality of life, decreases response to therapy, and contributes directly to mortality. Our lab has sub stantial data implicating the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathway as a causal factor in muscle wasting. Ho wever, the mechanisms by which the Shh pathway regulates muscle homeostasis have yet to be det ermined. In vitro data using C2C12 myotubes showed that agonists/inhibitors of t he Shh pathway decreased/increased the number o f nuclei per myotube respective ly. This suggests that the pathway may play a role in determining the differentiation pote ntial of myoblasts. In vivo , Ptch1 haploinsufficient exhibit increased pathway activity in the skeletal muscl e. Analysis of these mice revealed a hypotrophic muscle phenotype. Interest ingly, Ptch1+/lacZ mice have significantly reduced grip strength compared to wild-type litte rmates (WT), which progressively worsens with age. This indicates that increased pathway activit y may lead to a functional impairment of muscle. Shh is a pathway known to regulate stem c ell proliferation and differentiation. Primary myofibers were isolated from Ptch1+/lacZ and WT mice and stained for the satellite cell marker Pax7. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that Ptch1+/lacZ mice had far fewer Pax7 positive cells per myofiber. RN A-Seq analysis revealed a signif icant D1, Ki-67) in Pt ch1 haploinsufficient mice. Moreover, genes coding for proteins of the differentiated muscle phenotyp e, including myosin heavy chain 1 and alpha actinin, also were decreased. Taken together, the dat a establishes that Ptch1 and the Shh signaling pathway play a role in maintaining muscle homeost asis. Understanding the mechanism by which these processes are regulated will be critic al in determining the pathways therapeutic potential for diseases associated with muscle wasti ng.

Although several predominant mutations a nd dysregulated signaling pathwa ys have been identified in PDAC, the precise mechanisms that drive tu mor progression remain unclear. The canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which plays a pivotal role in no rmal embryonic development and tissue renewal, has also been implicated in several different types of human cancers. While mutations in t he Wnt pathway are surprisingly rare in PDAC, aberrant activation of canonical Wnt signaling has been observe d in an estimated 65% of human pancreatic tumors. Wnt7b, one of the 19 human Wnt ligands, is strongly ov erexpressed in PDAC and has been characterized as a potent mediat or of pathogenic Wnt signaling in pancreatic cancer. In addition to excess Wnt7b, a heparan sulfate known metastasis by acting as a co-receptor for many heparin-binding growth factors. Glypicans have been shown to contain binding domains that resem ble the Frizzled family of Wnt receptors and have been demonstrated to modulate Wnt signaling activity, suggesting a functional link between these two seemingly disparate entities. The demonstrated functional interaction of Wnts and glypicans, in addition to the known overexpression of W nt7b and GPC1 in PDAC, suggest that Wnt7b and GPC1 may be acting in concert to augment PDAC progre ssion. Accordingly, as the inter action of Wnt7b and GPC1 has never been investigated in any context, we have initiated a study to test the hypothesis that Wnt7b and GPC1 act synergistically to promote PDAC progression. First, we utilize d CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology in T3M4 and AsPC-1 pancreatic cance r cells, which exhibit strong c anonical Wnt signaling as well as high levels of both Wnt7b and GPC1, to generate clonal cell lines la cking Wnt7b, GPC1, or both Wnt7b and GPC1. These cell lines are being evaluated for differential Wn t signaling, proliferation, migration, invasion, and gene expression profiles. We also plan to investigate the interaction of GPC1 and Wnt7b in vivo using a syngeneic mouse model. The discovery of a meaningful functiona l link between Wnt7b and GPC1 would reveal a previously unknown int eraction in PDAC and may provide novel therapeutic targets in PDAC.

Reversing DNA methyla tion, thus potentially reactiva ting genes that combat cancer, constitutes a promising anti-cancer strategy. Interestingly, studies have ind icated that certain dietary polyphenols, such as resveratrol (RSV) present in gra pes, exert anti-cancer effects through epigenetic regulation of gene expression. However, those studies have bee n limited to candidate genes, an d comprehensive and mechanistic insights are missing. In the present study, following genome-wide DNA methylation ana lysis with Illumina 450K BeadChip array, we identified CpG sites within regulatory regions of tumor supp ressor genes that are hypomethylated upon treatment of breast cancer cells with resveratrol. Non-invasive MCF10CA1h and invasive MCF10CA1a human breast cancer cell lines we re used as an experimental mod el. Pyrosequencing and QPCR were performed to assess resp ectively methylation and expression of selected genes. We identified 990 hypomethylated CpG sites in MCF10CA1h and 1,1 46 hypomethylated CpG sites in MCF10CA1a cells upon 9-day treatment with 15\u00b5M resveratrol as c ompared with cells (differential methylation=-0.05 , nominal p<0.05, limma t-test). Those CpG sites corresponded to approximately 650 genes that were predominantly associated with tumor suppressor function in cancer. Based on magnitude of decreased met hylation, location of a change in regulatory gene region, and gene candidacy as an important tumor suppressor, we selected SEMA3A as resveratrol target for f urther investigation. As the array data indicated, resveratro l led to reduction in methylati on of SEMA3A promoter region. The 52% decrease in methylation of SEMA3A was confirmed by pyrosequenci in cancer cells.This coincided with 23% up-regulation of SEMA3A expression. In addition, the analysis of the effects on DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) demonstrated that resveratrol de creases expression of DNMT3A Down- regulation of this de novo DNA methylating enzyme may mediate decrease in methylation wit hin tumor suppressor genes upon resveratrol exposure. Further studies wil l investigate the role of DNMT3A in methylation events at the promoter of SEMA3A . These results demonstrate a role for polyphenol-mediated epigen etic modifications in reactivation of tumor suppressor genes in breast cancer and pave the way for further studies on the mechanisms behind these changes. It provides novel insight and supports epigenetic-targ eting strategies as an effective anti-cancer approach.

Basic Science Graduate StudentPOSTER #19 DETERMINING THE ROLE OF ELF1 IN PROSTATE CANCER Justin Budka1 1 Medical Sciences At Indiana Un iversity Bloomington, Bloomington, IN Email: jubudka@indiana.edu Various members of the ETS trans cription factor family have bee n shown to undergo chromosomal rearrangements in prostate tissu e and are involved in tumor for mation and progression. T he characterization of the roles for these oncogenes in prostate tissue is well studie d; however, the functions of the normally expressed ETS proteins in prosta te tissue are no t well understo od. Genomic and phenotypic assays, along with bioinformatic analyses, will be co mbined to gain insight into t he role of ELF1 in the prostate. Preliminary results indicate that ELF1 may ac t a s a t u m o r s u p p r e s s o r w i t h i n the prostate and compete with oncogenic ETS. Comparisons between the oncogenic ETS and ELF1 can then be used to better understand the mechanisms of how the ETS trans cription factor family regulates oncogenicity and could help pave the way for therapeutics to inhibit prostate tumor progression through this family. Basic Science Graduate StudentPOSTER #20 IMPAIRED SPINDLE ASSEMBLY CHECKPO INT IN VIVO PROMOTES MDS/AML I N A NOVEL MOUSE MODEL OF FANCONI ANEMIA Donna Cerabona1, Zahi Abdul Sater2, He3, Zejin Sun3 1 Pediatrics, Biochemistry And Molecular Biology, Indianapolis, IN 2 Pediatrics, Biochemist ry And Molecular Biology 3 Pediatrics Email: dcerabon@umail.iu.edu The Fanconi anemia (FA) signaling network prevents tumorigenesi s by protecting genomic integrity. Biallelic germline mutations in any of the FA genes cause Fanco ni anemia, an inherited syndrome of genomic instability, bone marrow failure, and cancer predisposi tion. Heterozygous inborn mutations in certain FA genes increase the risk of breast/ovarian cancers , and somatic mutations of FA genes occur in malignancies in non-Fa nconi patients. Thus, disruption of FA signaling promotes tumorigenesis in inherited genetic syndromes and in the general population. The FA network functions as a genome gatekeeper throughout the cell cycle. In interphase, this network prevents mutagenesis by facilitating DNA damage repair upon exposure to genotoxic insults. FA signaling has also recently been implicated in many aspects of cell division, including the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) that ensures high-fidelity ch romosome segregation. However, the in vivo contribution of abnormal mitosis to malignant transformation of FA-deficient cells remains unknown. To determine whether e rror-prone chromos ome segregation upon lo ss of FA signaling contributes to tumorigenesis, we generated a nov el murine FA model by genetica lly weakening the SAC in the FA- deficient background. These mice exhibited increased chromosoma l instability evidenced by elevated red blood cell micronucleation, increased frequency of chromosome missegregation in microscopy-based cytome assays, and augmented bone marrow karyo type instability. Importantly, unlike FA or SAC control mice, the FA-SAC mice were prone to pr emature death due to development of myelodysplasia and AML, recapitulating the manif estations of human Fanconi anemia. T h i s s t u d y p r o v i d e s in vivo evidence supporting the essential role of compromised chromoso me segregation in the development of myelodysplasia and leukemia d ue to impaired FA signaling. Our findings may have implications f or future therapies against FA- deficient chromosomally unstable cancers. Basic Science Graduate StudentPOSTER #21 CHARACTERIZING BONE METASTASIS- DERIVED CELLS IN A 3D CO-CULTURE SYSTEM Andy Chen1, Hiroki Yokota2 1 Biomedical Engineering, Engineering And Techno logy, IUPUI, Purdue University, Indianapolis, IN 2 Biomedical Engineering, Engineerin g And Technology, IUPUI, Indianapolis, IN Email: andychen@iupui.edu Bone is a frequent target of bre ast cancer metastasis, so addre ssing the paths by which breast cancers metastasize is incredibly impor tant. Here we utilize two breas t cancer-derived cell lines, tumor- derived MDA-MB-231 cells (TMD) and bone metastasis-derived MDA- MB-231 cells (BMD), to characterize behavioral differences that are associated with me tastasis and to identify genes involved in allowing a tumor cell to metastasize to bone. The two cancer cell types were c ompared under a variety of assa ys. First, a wound healing assay was performed to measure the differe nces in their migration, and TM D was found to migrate more quickly than BMD. Second, cancer cells were co-cultured with M C3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells, and BMD cells were found to form smaller cancer colonies than TMD. Third, MC3T3 osteoblast-like cells were cultured with cancer cells to form 3D spheroids, and the BMD cells were found to integrate better in the spheroi d. Finally, a gene microarray w as utilized to identify genes that were differentially expressed in TMD a nd BMD cells. Two genes of in terest, CDH12 and SSX1, were identified to be tested via RNA si lencing in TMD and BMD cells. Here we found that TMD cells were more migratory than BMD cells , while BMD cells readily integrated into spheroids composed of bone cells. Using 3D co-c ulture of bone and cancer cells can shed more light on the interac tions involved in metastasis that 2D assays are unable to detect. Genes of interest were ide ntified using RNA microarray. Future work w ill validate the role of these genes in the bone metastasis. Basic Science Graduate StudentPOSTER #22 Claire Walczak2 1 Biology, Indiana Universi ty Bloomington, Bloomington, IN 2 Medical Sciences, Indiana University Bloomington, Bloomington, IN Email: chenshe@indiana.edu Chromosomal instability (CIN) is defined as increased rates of whole chromosome mis-segregation during mitosis. It is a common feature in cancer cells and is p roposed to be associated with tumorigenesis, increased invasi veness, and resistance to cancer therapies. Polyploid cells are one hallmark of cancer, but the mechanisms that induce polyploidy a nd how they contribute to oncogenesis and CIN are not w ell understood. We found that MDA- MB-231 cells or HeLa cells could be induced into a polyploid state by treatment with SU665 6, a drug recently shown to be a potent Aurora B inhibitor. Drug treatment resulted in mitotic s pindles that were multi-polar and that contained high numbers of chromosomes. Upon drug washout, cell s resumed mitosis, but this division was highly aberrant resulting in lagging chromosomes, chromosome bridges and failed cytokinesis. Based on FISH analysis of chromosome 2 and chromos ome 7, we found that polyploid daughter cells have a heterogene ous karyotypic pool, indicating that these polyploid mitotic cells are highly chromosomally unstable. Previous studies have shown that several key mitotic genes are down-regulated in cells with incre ased ploidy caused by inducti on into the endocycle. Consistent with this idea, we found that the mitotic kinesin-14, HSET, was down-regulated in these cells upon return to mitosis. Cell lines t hat overexpressed HSET reduced multi-polarity in polyploid cells, consistent with observations showing that HSET is responsible f or centrosome clustering in cells with centrosome amplification. FI SH analysis revealed that HSE T overexpression narrowed the variation in karyotypes seen with drug treatment alone. These results suggest that restoring expression of down-regulated genes in these polyploid cells may provide a mechanism to restore chromosomal stability. Overall our results suggest that polyplo id cancer cells induced by mitosis inhibition are highly chromosomal unstable, causing a heterogen eous karyotypic pool in polyploid daughter cells, which may acceler ate adaption to external stres ses. Thus, polyploidy reversion in cancer cells may represent a sur vival mechanism for cancer cell s in response to cancer therapies and may be a major contributo r to disease relapse. Basic Science Graduate StudentPOSTER #23 GAIN-OF-FUNCTION MUTANT P53 DRI VES THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRE- LEUKEMIC HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELLS THROUGH REGULATING And Molecular Biol ogy, Indiana University School Of Medicine, INDIANAPOLIS, IN 2 Department Of Pediatrics, Indiana Univers ity School Of Medicine, INDIANAPOLIS, IN 3 Department Of Biochemistry & Mole cular Biology, University Of Miam i Miller School Of Medicine, Miami, FL Email: sisichen@iu.edu Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive blood cancer wi th poor prognosis. AML is thought to arise from leukemia stem cells (LSCs); however, recent evide nce suggest that the transforming events may initially give rise t o pre-leukemic hematopoietic st em cells (HSCs), preceding the formation of fully transformed LSCs. Pre-leukemic HSCs have bee n shown to contribute to normal blood development and harbor a selective growth advantage compa red to normal HSCs. Recently, acquired somatic gain-of-functi on (GOF) p53 mutations were iden tified in the blood of aged healthy individuals as well as AML patients, suggesting that p53 mutati ons may be early events in the pathogenesis of AML. Thus, it is important to investigate the r ole of mutant p53 in leukemia initiation and progression. We found that some GOF mutant p53 proteins, including p53R248W, p53Y220C, and p53R273H, enhanced the self-renewal potential of normal HSCs without affe cting terminal differentiation. Further, we discovered that HSCs expressing mutant p53 show enh anced clonal expansion following genotoxic stress. These findings demonstrate that HSC s expressing mutant p53 share several key features of pre-leukemic HSCs. Although p53 mutatio ns are limited in AML, p53 mutations do co-exist with mutations of epigenetic regulator AS XL1 in AML. Somatic ASXL1 mutations occur in 10-30% of patients with myeloid malignancies and are associated with adverse outcome. To determine the synergy between mutant p53 an d ASXL1 deficiency in leukemogenesis, we generated p53R248W/+ Asxl-1+/- mice. We found that the expression of mutant p53rescued the self-renewal defect of Asxl-1+/- bone marrow cells in both primary and secondary transplantation assays, suggesting that mutant p53 may cooperat e with Asxl-1 deficiency in the formation of leukemia stem cells. To investigate how GOF p53 regul ates HSC self-renewal, we per formed transcript profiling assays to compare gene expression in HSCs isolated from p53+/+ and p53R248W/+ mice. We found that mutant p53 regulates the expres In addition, we found that there were increased leve ls of H3K27me3 and decreased levels of H3K36me3 in p53R248W/+ HSCs compared to that of the p53+/+ HSCs. Given that none of these epigenetic regulators are modulated by WT p53 in HSCs, we demonstrated that mutant p53 modulates epigenetic regulators in HSCs. To understa nd how mutant p53 enhances the self-renewal of ASXL1- deficient HSCs, we performed H3 p53R248W/+,Asxl1+/-, and p53R248W/+Asxl1+/-mice. We found that Asxl1+/- HSPCs exhibited significantly low levels of H3K27me3 at promoters, and these defects were rescued in the mu tant p53 background, demonstrating that mutant p53 maintains global H3K27me3 in the absence of ASXL1. Collectively, we demonstrated that gain-of-function mutant p5 3 drives the development of pre- leukemic HSCs by a novel mechani sm involving disruption epigenetic pathways.

Due to its late stage at clinical presentation and its highly aggressive nature, PDAC patients ha ve a poor prognosis with a median survival of 6-7 months. In addition to frequent major driver mutations (KRA S, SMAD4, TP53, and CDKN2A) and a plethora of other low-frequency mutations, PDAC is associated w ith overexpression of tyrosine kinase receptors including EGFR and MET and their corresponding ligand s. Bioinformatics analysis of the PDAC data set from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that ~8% of PDAC patients harbor upregulated MET gene expression. Furthermore, EGFRgene expression was upreg ulated in ~4% of patients. Importantly, patients that possessed alterati ons in METhad a statistically s ignificant shorter survival than patients without alterations in MET. Addition of cabozantinib (MET inhibitor) an d erlotinib (EGFR inhibitor) enhanced gemcitabine in 3-dimensional culture. Treat ment with gemcitabine alone had no effect on survival of mouse models of PDAC. By contrast, gemcitabine toge ther with cabozantinib and erlotinib (G.E.C) extended survival significantly in three different mous e models of PDAC. Importantly, gene set enrichment analysis of tumors fr om mice harboring Krasand TP53R 172Hmutations (KPC) showed significant enrichment of MET and EGFR signatures compared to wild-type mic e. We therefore sought to determine the effect of cabozantinib and erlo tinib treatment without gemcitab ine in KPC mice. This targeted therapy combination prolonged KPC mouse su rvival compared with gemcitab ine alone. These results suggest that therapy targeting both MET and EGFR could improve survival of P DAC patients whose tumors exhibit activation of these pathways.

There has been a lot of research around genes in fluencing CRC, despite its extensive understanding on the genetic perspective and the emergence of dr ugs targeting these genes, the tumor progression could be hardly mitigated. Howeve r, immune therapy has recently b een observed to be effective in CRC treatment and diagnosis. This study focuses on developing a statis tically validated multi- feature analytical approach to identify immuno-onc ology targets. The features considered in this study were gene expression, DN A methylation, concepts from literature and immuno-cancer pathways. The network algorithm will identify the potentially relevant immu no-oncology modules of CRC. For the study level-3 data (7.2 gigabytes) of gene expression and DNA methylation was obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Around 9951 genes were identified to be significant from the gene expression data analys is and 19788 genes significant in DNA methylation data. The CRC and Immuno-oncology concepts were manually a nnotated from 50 peer reviewed articles. The output of the preliminary analysis could predict 95 concepts annotated to the 1587 significant genes and were integrated into the network. The top ra nk concepts in terms of genes associated were 'apoptosis' , growth factor ', 'protein arginine methyltransferase ', 'carcinoembryonic antigen' and ' methyl binding protein '. The genes annotated with highest number of concepts were 'PRMT5' , 'CSF2 ', 'CFLAR' and ' MLH1 '. These genes were observed in the literature as targets of CRC.

The only curative treatment is allogeneic bone marrow transplant, but even this rigorous therapy yields only a 50% relapse-free 5-yea r survival. A majority of patients have hyperactive Ras signaling, with the most common mutation being somatic gain-of-function (GOF) mutations tyrosine phosphatase Shp2. Previous work in the Chan lab has shown that the PI3K catalytic subunit p110 is needed for both Akt and Er k hyperactivation, and promotes G OF Shp2-induced GM-CSF hypersensitivity and hyperproliferation, co ntributing to the progression of JMML. Based on the significant role of p110 in promoting GOF Shp2-induced l eukemia, we investigated potent ial tyrosine kinases that can cooperate with p110 to promote Akt and Erk activation and lead to hyperproliferation of myeloid cells. Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase ( BTK) has identified a s molecule in lymphoid malignancies and the BTK inhibitor, ibrutinib, has been approved for use in patients with B cell leukemias. From studies done in t he context of B cell receptor signaling, it is known that BTK is activated downstream of p110 and then signals to PLC\u00bf2 and PK C to promote ERK activation. H owever, BTK also phosphorylates B cell adaptor f or PI3K (BCAP), allowing phospho -BCAP to bind to the regulatory p85 subunit and promote activity of PI3K. Therefore, we hypothesize that BTK signaling enhances p110d hyperactivation in a BCAP-depende manner, thus promoting leukemia. BTK is Shp2 Using specific BTK and p110d inhibitors provided AcertaPharma, we found that pr oliferation of GOF Shp2-expressing cells and phosphorylation of Akt and E RK are decreased cooperatively by the two inhibitors. Although there was no effect on PLC\u00bf2 phosphorylation with either of the two inhib itors, we found that BCAP phosphorylation is increased in mutant Shp2 macrophages, suggesting BCAP as an alt ernative downstream target of BTK to signal to Akt and ERK. These studies are timely and significant , as the AcertaPharma inhibitors are currently being tested in combination for safety and efficacy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, and therefore have the potential to be a novel treatment in patients with JMM L.

Tumors have many aberrant epigenet ic alterations, many of which affect the expression of tumor suppressor ge nes. Epigenetic changes occur at sites of chronic inflamation, however it is not known how these epigenetic alte rations are initiated. We hy pothesize that the rec ruitment of epigenetic proteins to sites of oxidaitve da mage through their interaction with mismatch repair (MMR) proteins are important for initiating epigene tic alterations. Here we demons trated that after hydroge n peroxide treatment, MMR proteins MSH2 and MSH6 become localized to sites of oxidati ve DNA damage and this results in the recruitment of epigenetic silenci ng proteins such as DNA methyl transferase 1 (DNMT1) to chromatin, thereby reducing the expression of tumor suppressor genes. However, it is not known what mechanism drives oxidative damage-induced MSH2 and MSH6 nuclear localization and their chromatin binding. We demonstrated that removing the sequence of any one of the three nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in the MSH6 disordered region reduces t he oxidative damage induced-nuc lear localization of MSH2 and MSH6, suggesting NLSs impor peroxide-induced nuclear translocation of and MSH6. We also demonstrated that inhi biting Jak2 reduced the hydrogen peroxide-induced and/or MSH6 by Jak2 may be important for their interaction with oxidative DNA damage and r educing such phosphorylation by using Jak2 inhibitors may aboragate the int eraction between MSH2/6 and DNA , thereby reducing the localization of DNMT1 to chromatin. Understandi ng the mechanism by which become localized to chromatin after oxidative dama ge will potentially allow us t o develop treatment strategies to reduce the initiation of aberrant epigenetic alterations during chronic in flammation and therefore reduce tumorigenesis in people with chronic inflammatory diseases.

Its overexpression correlates strongly with poor prog nosis in patients and causes accelerated tumor progression, metastasis, and chemoresistance in vi vo. While several studies have begun to examine downstream targets of ZNF217, no studies have looked at the regulation of localiza tion of this protein. The localization of ZNF217 may also have value as a biomarker to predict patient prognosis. As determined by both immunohistochemistry and western analysis, we find that ZNF217 protein is predominantly nuclear but can be cytoplasmic in some human breast cancer tumors and cell lines. Smaller isoforms of ZNF217 are also present in human breast tumors and cell lines, but the importance of these smaller isoforms is still unknown. Ou r current efforts focus on further elucidating the underlying mechanisms of the localization of ZNF217 and in understanding the ro le of alternative ZNF217 is oforms in breast cancer progression. Using truncation mutants, we will determine regions of ZNF217 required for localization. Time-lapse microscopy of ZNF217 fluorescent fusion proteins will be used to determine if ZNF217 localization changes over the course of th e cell cycle. The consequences of mislocal ization of ZNF217 will also be studied. Due to its aberrant localization in some human breast tumor samples, the localization of ZNF217 has the potential to be used as a clinical biomarker. Using the localization of ZNF217 in human breast tumors and the corresponding patient data, we can determine the usefulness of the localization of ZNF217 as a biomarker. The localization of ZNF217 may be used to predict patient prognosis, survival, or recurrence. Identifying the mechanism and regulation of the locali zation of ZNF217 may brin g about novel drug targets for tumors that overexpress ZNF217 and cause poor pr ognosis in patients. The mechanism of regulation of the localization of ZNF217 may be th e basis of a biomarker assay used in patients for personalized treatment strategies. Basic Science Graduate StudentPOSTER #29 KNOCKING OUT MYD88 SIGNALING IN D Allogeneic hematopoietic cell tr ansplantation (HCT) is a potent ial curative option for those affected by cancers of the bone m arrow and blood through the beneficial eff ect of the graft-ver sus leukemia (GVL) activity. However, graft-versus- host disease (GVHD) hinders the efficacy of allogeneic HCT as a curative treatment. Both the harmful GVHD and the beneficial GVL effect are mediated by T cells from the donor. Attempts to separate GVL and GVH D have yet to reach fruition. MyD88 signaling has recently bee n shown to be important both in Th1 and Th17 responses, as loss of MyD88 signaling leads to loss of proliferative ability in response to antigen as well as production of IFN\u00bf and IL17 (Schenten D., 2014). In GVHD models knocking out MyD88 in host hematopoietic antigen presenting cells (APCs) has no effect on GVHD (L i H., 2011). The role of MyD88 s ignaling in donor T cells, however, has yet to be elucidated. We hypothesized that knocking out MyD88 in do nor T cells will have a protective effect in GVHD by reducing pathogenic T cell proliferation and cytokine e xpression. Here, we show that knocking out MyD88 in the donor T cell compar tment reduces GVHD severity and mortality in multiple models of GVHD. The amount of the proinflammatory cytokine IFN\u00bf found in the pl asma of mice receiving MyD88 KO T cells was significantly lower than in m ice receiving WT T cell. Also, the percentage of IFN\u00bf+ T c e l l s i n t h e intestines, the target organ in GVHD most associated with morta lity, was significantly lower in the mice receiving MyD88 KO T cells. This difference seems to be indepen dent of proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. It is also independent of IL1R signaling, as experim ents transplanting IL1R KO donor T cells showed no difference in either G VHD severity or mortality compa r e d t o r e c i p i e n t s o f W T T c e l l s . T h e decrease in GVHD is dependent on MyD88 signaling in CD4 T cells and not CD8 T cells. This may be due to the decrease in production of GM-CSF by CD4 T cells without MyD 88 signaling. Using CSF2 (gene for GM- CSF) KO mice as donors and transplanting KO CD4 T cells with WT C D 8 T c e l l s w o u l d h e l p t o d i s c e r n whether or not GM-CSF producti on by CD4 T cells is actually res ponsible for this decrease in GVHD severity and mortality. Using an MLL-AF9 cells developed in our lab, MyD 88 KO T cells, primed through a mixed lymphocyte reaction, showed no di fference in cytolytic activity . I will use these MLL-AF9 cells to confirm these results in vivo. I will also use the MyD88 small molecule inhibitor ST2825 as a therapeutic approach toward reducing GVHD while sparing GVL.

Juxtacrine and paracrine interactions drive changes in gene expression that allow for cancer cells to succe ssfully adapt to their new microenvironment and form metastatic tumors. These gene expression changes can be induced by alterations in the activity of transcription factors (TFs). Indeed, deregulation of several f amilies of TFs has been implicated in OC. The ETS family of TFs can promote ce llular migration and invasion t hrough induction of various genes, including matrix metalloproteases. Usi ng a 3D culture model that mimics the early steps of metastasis, we investigated the expression of ETS TFs in meta stasizing OC cells, and found that ETS1 was the most upregulated. Using a tissue microarray, we determined that ETS1 is also upregulated in human ovarian cancer samples compared to normal fallopian tube epithelium. Validating the importance of this finding, we found that high ETS1 expression correlates with po or patient prognosis. In in vitro experiments, knocking down ETS1 in OC cells reduced migration, proliferation, and colony formation. We also observed reduced invasion through and colonization of the 3D culture. Overexpression of ETS1 in OC c ells had the opposite effect. Knocking out ETS1 in OC cells using CRISPR/CAS9 caused a reduction in tumor mass in mouse xenografts. Both ChIP- seq and RNA-seq were performed t o look for direct downstream ta rgets of ETS1. ETS1 was found to promote the expression of a numbe r of genes involved in EMT, an d also strongly induced focal adhesion kinase (FAK) expression. FAK inhi bition yielded the same functional effect as ETS1 knockdown. Overexpression of FAK rescued t he functional effect of ETS1 kno ckout, further suggesting that FAK is downstream of ETS1. These results suggest that interactions be tween OC cells and the microenvironment induce ETS1 expression, and that this increase in ETS1 enhances the ability of OC cells to form metastatic colonies. Furthermore, FAK is one of the key mediators of this metastasis-promoting ability of ETS1. Basic Science Graduate StudentPOSTER #31 ACTIVATION OF A NOVEL FORM OF REG ULATED NECROSIS TO ELIMINATE EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX DET ACHED EPITHELIAL CELLS Mark Hawk1, Zachary Schafer1 1 Biological Sciences, Notre Dame, South Bend, IN Email: mhawk1@nd.edu The overwhelming majority of breast cancer deaths are caused by t h e m e t a s t a s i s o f c a n c e r c e l l s f r o m t h e primary tumor to distant sites in the body. For cancer cells to successfully metastasize, they must: detach from the primary tumor, move out of the original tissue into the cir culatory or the lymphatic system, travel to a new site followed by arresting their movement, and then extravasate to begin colonizing a secondary site. When normal epithelial cells detach fr om the extracellular matrix (E CM), they induce caspase-dependent cell death which is known as anoikis. Anoikis can therefore serve as a cri ticalbarrier to metastasis as cancer cells are exposed to limited and variable matrix conditions during each s tep of the metastatic cascade. However, our previous studies suggest that anoikis evasion is not sufficient to protect ECM-detached cells from cell death. Using MCF10A mammary epithelial cells, we have previously shown that ECM-detachment induced metabolic changes can compromise the survival of detached cells , although the precise mechanism controlling cell death remains unclear. Here , we present data suggesting th at ECM-detached cells can also be eliminated by regulated necrosis (RN), a ge netically progra mmed, caspase-i ndependent form of necrosis that is morphologically indistinguishabl e from classical necrosis. In g eneral, the molecular mechanisms involved in RN are poorly understood. With this in mind, the current most a ppreciated subtype of RN, RIP3, MLKL, and PGAM5 to execute cell death. These data have been gathered in attached cells. Of note, our data suggest that ECM- detachedcells are being eliminated by a mechanism that is dependent on t he kinase activity of RIP1K. Fu rther studies have shown an increase in the expression of CYLD, a deubiquitin ating enzyme that specifically removes ubiquitin chains from RIP1, in turn stabilizing both RIP1 expression and activation. Upon analyzing other dependent executioners of necroptosis, we have strikingly found that TNF , RIP3, and MLKL are all dispensable for RN to occur in ECM- detachment. Furthermore, using a variety of molecular tools, su ch as 3D cell culture, we have found that PGAM5 is necessary for the execu tion of ECM-detachment induced RN. These findings uncover a novel and distinct RN pathway and highlight the need to more thoroughly u nderstand RN as well as the mechanisms employed by ECM-detached cells t o antagonize RN and promote the ir survival in detachment. Basic Science Graduate StudentPOSTER #32 NFKB INDUCING KINASE- A NOVEL DRIVER OF SCHWANN CELL TRANSFORMATION IN NEUROFIBROMATOSIS TYPE 2 Eric Hawley1, Benjamin Wahle, Jeff Gehlhaus en, Yongzheng He, Wade Clapp2 1 Biochemistry, Indianapolis, IN 2 Pediatrics, Indianapolis, IN Email: ehawley@iupui.edu Neurofibromatosis Type II (NF2) is an autosomal predisposition syndrome which germline haploi nsuffiency at the NF2 locus. NF2 patients almost invariably suffer from bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VS) and are at a greatly increased risk for the development of other tumors of neural crest derived tissues such as meningiomas, ependymomas, and ast rocytomas. The NF2 gene codes for the protein, Merlin (Moesin-Ezrin-Rad ixin-Like Protein). Tumor form ation is believed to be the result of loss of heterozygosity at the NF2 locus, leading to total loss of Merlin in the tumor progenitor cells. Sporadic vestibular schwannomas can develop in individuals who do not ha rbor germline mutations at the NF2 locus. But, greater than 90% of these tu mors have biallelic disruption of NF2, further cementing the critical role of loss of Merlin in Schwann cell oncogenesis. Although vestibular schwannomas are largely benign, their growth can compromise auditory, vestibular, and facial nerve fu nction, causing significant morbidity in affected patients. Current fron tline therapy for the treatment of VS is surgical resection. Depending on the extent to which the VS has infiltrated surrounding structures, the need for surgical margins can further compromise auditory, vestibular, and facial nerve function and surgery does not address the underlying pathophysiology of NF2 to prevent tumor recurrence. In order to explore the cell signaling pathways by which loss of Merlin drives oncogenic transformation and to develop n ew therapeutic targets for NF2, our lab has developed a murine model of NF2 in which the phenotype of the m ice largely recapitulates the clinical pathology observed in NF2 patients. The cell signaling pathways by wh ich Merlin acts to exert its t umor suppressive effects are not fully understood. But using our NF2 mice as well as human VS tissue, we have demonstrated that loss of Merlin results in hyperactivation of the NF-kB pathway. Probing deeper into the individual components of NF-kB signaling, we have found that both in human vestibular schwanno ma samples and schwannomas in our mice, there is an accumulation of a c atalytically active 55kD fragmen t of NF-kB Inducing Ki nase (NIK). This 55 kD NIK fragment can drive non-ca nnonical NF-kB signaling. When ove rexpressed in wildtype Schwann and transferred into the sciatic n erve of immunodeficient mice, the 55kD fragment is sufficient to drive schwannoma genesis, even in the presence of functional Merlin. This 55kD fragment lacks a C-terminal negative regulatory domain found in the full length protein and we hypothesize that loss of Merlin in Schwann cells leads to accumulation of the 55kD NIK fragment and consti tutive NF-kB activation. In turn, NF-kB hyperactivation drives Schwann c ell transformation and tumor fo rmation. This work highlights NIK as a novel potential therapeutic target for the treatment of Neurofibromat osis Type II. Basic Science Graduate StudentPOSTER #33 A SPECIFIC CO-ACTIVATOR INTE RACTION DEFINES THE ONCOGENIC MECHANISM OF ETS FACTORS IN PROSTATE CANCER Vivekananda Kedage1, Nagarathinam Selvaraj2, Justin Budka2, Travis Molecular And Cellular Biochemist ry , Indiana University, Bloomington, IN 2 Medical Sciences, Indiana University 3 Indiana University School Of Medicine 4 Medical Sciences, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN Email: vkedage@indiana.edu In 50-70% of prostate cancers, c hromosomal rearrangements resul t in the overexpression of a subset of ETS family transcription factors (ERG, ETV1, ETV4, or ETV5) that are not expressed in the normal prostate. Aberrant expression of one of these oncoge nic ETS genes causes prostate adenocarcinoma in mouse models in the presence of a constitutiv ely active PI3K pathway. The objective of the present study is to identify therapeutically t argetable co-factors which cooperate with oncogenic ETS. Pull-down of co-factors from nuclear extracts us ing purified ERG followed by mass spectrometry analysis identified a novel co-activator. We then tested 21 ETS proteins for their ability to bind this co-activator. Strik ingly, the same four ETS protei ns that cause prostate cancer were the only ETS proteins that interacted with this co-activator, indic ating a specificity mechanism. Further, the interaction between oncogenic ETS and this co-activator was necessary for transcriptional activation, prostate cell migration, anchorage independent grow th and xenograft tumor formation. These findings indicate that this specific protein-protein inte raction is a key to the oncogenic function of ETS family transcription fa ctors in prostate cancer. Basic Science Graduate StudentPOSTER #34 CADHERINS MODULATE OVARIAN CANCER Oleg Kim2, Mark Aleber2, M. Sharon Stack3 1 Biological Sciences, Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 2 Applied And Computational Mathematics And Statistics, Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 3 Chemistry And Biochemistry, Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN Email: yklymenk@nd.edu Epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) metastasizes by shedding of cancer cells from the primary tumor into the peritoneal cavity where they form multicellular a ggregates (MCAs). These free-fl oating metastatic units along with single cells subsequently adhere to peritoneum, migrate through mesothelial cell layer into submesothelial matrix and proliferate into secondary tumor masses. EOC progression is accompanied by an increase of E-cadherin (Ecad) expression at early stages of metastasis and abundant expression of N-cadherin (Ncad) later in the disease. The contribution of MCA dynamics to the metastatic success and role of cadherins in MCA formation, survival in ascitic fluid and further fate at the secondary anchorage site remain largely unknown. In atte mpt to mimic and trace cell/aggrega te anchorage and invasion into submesothelial matrix, we performed live imaging of fluorescently tagged epithelial type (Ecad+) OvCa433- RFP and mesenchymal DOV13-GFP single cells and MCAs during the 3-dimentional rat tail collagen I (3D RTCI) invasion process. Study revealed dramatic differences between the ability of Ecad+ and Ncad+ ovarian cancer cells and MCAs to migrate through the 3D RTCI gel constructs. Both Ncad+ DOV13 and Ecad+ OvCa433 single cells, as well as OvCa433 MCAs, retained superficial localization on top of a collagen layer. On the contrary, DOV13 MCAs demonstrated considerable plasticity and lateral motility, quick dispersal on top of the collagen layer with subsequent penetration into the 3D matrix within 72hrs. Strikingly, rarely seeded DOV13 single cells overtime established a cell network on top of RTCI and further became capable of invading the underlying matrix layers, stably keeping connections with the adjacent cells dispersed in the upper layer. To test the possibility of Ncad+ \"invading leaders\" paving the way for the rest of the cells and facilitating the movement of non-invasive Ecad+ cell population through the existing microtracks, we conducted collagen invasion live imaging utilizing a mixture of invasive DOV13 and non- invasive OvCa433 cells and MCAs. Intriguingly, the two lines have eventually formed completely separate cell networks. Subsequently, DOV13 cells successfully invade d in RTCI, whereas OvCa433 cells stayed isolated on top in a dispersed monolayer and didn't follow through microtracks. These preliminary data support the hypothesis that MCA dynamics and subsequent fate at the secondary anchorage site may largely depend on cadherin composition. Our findings suggest that ev en theoretically invasive, Ncad+ cells require well established interactions with neighboring cells linked to the surface in order to migrate down. If such type of collective behavior is the case at the EOC metastatic site, then intraperitoneally floating Ncad+ aggregates occur under timing advantage over the single cells due to pre-formed cell-cell connections and thus, therapeutic approach aimed at MCA disruption and blocki ng cell-cell junction re-creation is reasonable to test.Basic Science Studen tPOSTER #35 NOVEL ROLE OF MIR-29 IN PANCREAT IC CANCER AUTOPHAGY AND ITS THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL Murray Korc4,5, 1 And Molecu lar Genetics, Indiana University Sc hool Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 2 Department Of Biochemistry And Molecular Biology, Indiana University School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 3 Department Of Biochemistry And Molecular Biology, Department Of Medical And Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 4 Department Of Biochemistry And Molecular Biology, Department Of Medicine, Indiana University School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 5 Center For Pancreatic Cancer Research, IUPUI, Indiana University Melvin And Bren Simon Cancer Center, Indianapolis, IN 6 Department Of Pathology And Laboratory Medicine, I ndiana University School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN Email: jjkwon@iupui.edu Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one leth al human malignancies with a five-year survival rate of 8% and is often undiagnosed until it has metastasized. These ad vanced tumors display resistance to current therapeutic modalities. The lack of effectiv e therapies and early detection reinforces the need to under stand molecular mechanisms associated with PDAC to develop novel therapies. We found consi stent downregulation of miR-29 in pancreatic cancer cells, and its restored expression sensitized chemotherapeutic resistant pancreatic cancer cell lines to gemcitabine, leading to reduced cancer cell viability and increased cytotoxicity. Furth ermore, reintroduction of miR-29 blocked autophagy flux, evidenced accumulation of autophagosomes a nd autophagy su bstrate, p62, and miR-29 decreased ATG9A and TFEB expression , which are critical for autophagosome trafficking and lysosomal function respectively. Subsequent knockdown of ATG9A or TFEB expression alone or in combination resulted in inhibition of autophagy similar t o miR-29 overexpression. Final ly, miR-29 reduced migration, invasion, and anchorage independent growth of pancreatic cancer cells. Collectively, ou r findings indicate that miR-29 functions as a potent autophagy inhibitor that sensit izes pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine and decreases their invasive potential. Our data provides evidence for the use of miR-29 as a novel therapeutic agent to target PDAC.

Ov Ca follows a unique form of metastasis, spreading throughout the peritoneal cavity. Epid emiologic data suggest that parity re duces the risk of developing OvCa, with more births providing greater protection. Despite the association of parity with a decreased OvCa incidence, very few studies have explored the relationship between parity and metastasis. A recent study compared metastatic success to the omentum in 12-m onth-old parous and 5-month-old virgin C57BL/6 mice, reporting that parous mice are less susceptible to metastasis due to parity-associated differences in the immune compositional profile in the omental fat band (Cohen et al. 2013). This study compared mice of different ages and did not report specific numbers of pr egnancies. To further investigate the role of parity number in OvCa metastasis, we designed a study C57BL/6 were evaluated: nulliparous (P0), parous 1 (P1), and parous 3 (P3) mice. We tested the effect of parity on metastatic success in vivo with an allograft study using the C57BL/6 syngeneic ID8 mouse ovarian surface epithelial cell line. ID8 RFP-tagged cells (106) were intraperitoneally injected into P0, P1 and P3 mice. The mice were imaged once a week starting at 5 weeks post injection and sacrificed for dissection at 8 weeks post injection. Live imaging data suggested OvCa metastasis was less efficient in the P3 animals compared to the other cohorts. After dissection, abdominal organs were imaged ex vivo and tumor burden was quantified. In contrast to the results of Cohen et al. that utilized a different syngenei c cell line, no significant difference in metastasis to the omentum in the parous animals was detected. P3 animals displayed significantly less metastasis to the gonadal fat depots, suggesting that gonadal adipose in multi-parous animals is a unique microenvironment, resilient to metastasis. To investigate responsible factors, we isolated RNA from periovarian adipose of healthy non-tumor bearing P0, P1 and P3 mice and carried out RNAseq. Among the pathways enriched in the RNAseq dataset, immune response, cell adhesion and developmental pathways were prominent.

OvCa metastasizes uniquely, spreading through the peritoneal cavity and generating widespread metastatic sites. The vast majority of OvCa cases occur in women over 40 and the medi an age at diagnosis is 63 (SEER). Despite age being a significant risk factor for the development of OvCa , there is a paucity of studies addressing the role of aging in OvCa metastasis. To our knowledge, there are n o reports utilizing old mice to investigate the effects of age on metastasis in vivo . We designed a study using a C57BL/6 model of aging where youn g (Y) mice are 3-6 months of age and aged (A) mice are 20-23 months o f age, corresponding to young (20-30 years) and aged (60-67 years) humans. U sing the C57BL/6 syngeneic ID8 mouse ovarian surface epithelial cell line, we tested the effect of aging on metastatic success in vivo. An allograft study was carried out with Y and A mice that were intraperiton eally injected with 3.7x106 ID8 RFP-tagged cells. The mice were imaged once a week starting at 4.5 weeks post in jection and were sacrificed f or dissection at 8 weeks post injection. Live imaging suggested OvCa metastasis was more efficient in the age d animals than in the young animals. After dissection, the abdominal organs were imaged ex vivo and tumor burden was quantified. The aged mice displayed heavier tumor burden in the gonadal fat compared to t he young. Interestingly, no difference in metastasis to the omentum was de tected.To investigate why gonad al fat is more receptive to metastasis in the aged animals, periovarian adipose from 4 young and 4 aged healt hy non-tumor bearing mice was isolated for RNAseq analysis. Several immune p athways involving B cells were found to be significantly upregulated in the RNA from aged animals. Studies will be conducted to elucida te the status of B cells in aging periovarian adipose, including immunohistochemistry for CD45 and other B ce ll markers upregulated in the RNAseq dataset. Basic Science StudentPOSTER #38 CLASSIFICATION OF GLIOBLASTOMA MU LTIFORME (GBM) SUBTYPES BY GEN E EXPRESSION LEVEL MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS Tarun karthik kumar Mamidi1 1 Bioinformatics, Indiana University Purdue Email: tkmamidi@umail.iu.edu Classification of Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) subtypes by Gen Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the common and most malignant of the glial tumors. GBM is classified into four subtypes: Classical, Mesenchymal, Proneural and Neural. The diagnosis and determination of therapy respon se of a cancer patient can be effectively done by identifying its subtypes. However, previous cla ssification method (Prediction Analysis for Microarrays - PAM50) are clinically-based and have limited diagnostic ab ility. This study focuses to predict and classify the samples of GBM using Machine learning algo rithms. For the current study, 173 samples were considered for an automated subtypes. A scoring technique was used (PAM50) and a new was developed that compares the average gene expressi on value for a particular gene across different subtypes. The scoring was define d as (i) Gene Expression scor e (CM1) = avg(x)-avg(y)/1+(max(y) -min(y)) ; (ii) Gene x and yare GBM subtypes. Principal component analys is was also performed for each subtype and also for combinations. Top discriminative genes identified using CM1 score, CM1 score and Principal Componentamong all subtypes were used for classifi cation. These genes were loaded to Weka software suit separately and evaluated for the prediction using different classifiers like J48, Random forest, Decision tree etc.., and 10 fold cl assification. On using the top ten discriminative genes from all subtypes for classification, gave high number of false positives. When triplet combinations of subtypes were evaluated the fa lse positive decreased substantially for the (i) Group1: Classical, Mesenchymal, Proneural; (ii) Group 2: Classical, Neural, Proneural. From the above preliminary observed results, it can be concluded that Mesenchymal and Neural have higher similarity. This is hypothesized as a causative effe ct of occurrence of same set of genes in both subtypes. Significant genes for each of the subtypes were identified for 95% confidence interval using the unpaired t-test. The number of significant genes identified were 267, 345, 317, and 195 for Classical, Mesenchymal, Neural and Proneural respectively. Basic Science Graduate ULATES EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX-DETACHED CELLS Joshua Mason1, Zachary Schafer 1 Department Of Biological Sciences, University Of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN Email: jmason6@nd.edu In order for cancer cells to surv ive during metastasis, they mu st overcome anoikis, a caspase-dependent cell death process triggered by extra cellular matrix (ECM) detachmen t, and rectify detachme nt-induced metabolic defects that compromise cell sur vival. However, the precise sig nals used by cancer cells to facilitate their survival during metastasis remain poorly understood. We have di scovered that oncogenic Ras facilitates the survival of ECM-detached cancer cells by using distinct effecto r pathways to regulate metabolism and block anoikis. Surprisingly, we find that while Ras-mediated phosphat idylinositol (3)-kinase signaling is critical for rectifying ritical downstream effector is serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase-1 (SGK-1) rather than Akt. Our data also indicate that oncogenic Ras blocks anoikis by diminishing expression of the phosphatase PHLPP1 (PH Domain and Leucine-Rich Repeat Protein Phosphatase 1), which promotes anoikis through the activation o f p38 MAPK. Thus, our study represents a novel paradigm whereby oncogene-i nitiated signal transduction c an promote the survival of ECM-detached cells through divergent d ownstream effectors. Basic Science #40 RAS-MEDIATED REGULATION OF CY TOCHROME C-INDUCED CASPASE ACTIVATION IS DEPENDENT ON THE S TATUS OF EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX ATTACHMENT Chelsea McCallister1 1 University Of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN Email: cmccall1@nd.edu Hyperactivating mutations in Ras are found in a significant per centage of cancers, with a particularly high frequency in pancreatic and colon carcinomas. The hyperactivati on of Ras drives a vast number of distinct downstream signaling pathways that play an important role in di sease progression. One outcome of overactive oncogenic Ras signali ng the inhibition of anoikis , a form of apoptotic cell death caused by detachment from the extracellular matrix (ECM). It is well-esta blished that one mechanism of anoikis inhibition by Ras involves impaired mitochondrial cytochrome c release. In addition, here, we have found that Ras- mediated anoikis inhibition can also occur downstream of mitoch ondrial cytochrome c release. Our data suggest that anoikis inhibition following cytochrome c release is not dependent on changes in the abundance of the Apaf-1, pro-caspase-9, or pro-caspase-3. Instead, our da ta suggest that Ras signaling leads to an inhibition in the ability of caspase-9 to bind Apaf-1 which the reby inhibits proper formation of the apoptosome and caspase activation. Interestingly, in stark contrast to the inhibition of cytochrome c-induced apoptosis in ECM-detached cells, the overexpression of oncogenic Ras in ECM- attached cells results in enhanced sensitivity to exogenous cytochrom e c. This sensitization was f ound to be due to upregulation of apoptosomal proteins (e.g. Apaf-1, pro-cas pase-9) in an ERK/MAPK dependent manner. In aggregate, our data suggest that in addition to inhibiting the release of cytochrome c in b oth attachment and detachment, oncogenic Ras drives additional mechanisms that prevent apoptosome formation and caspase activation in detachment. Furthermore, our data support a model whereby ECM-attached cell s containing oncogenic Ras mutations could be selectively eliminated by cytochrome c or agents that mimic its action.

Ex vivo living biopsy samples, as thick as a millimeter, can be volumetrically imaged in real time using las er ranging and coherent detection as the tissue responds to applied therapies. The therapeutic drug mechanism of action has physiological effects that alter the motions of constituents insid e the living cells and hence p roduce telltale Doppler spectral signatures that relate to the effectiveness of t he drug. This functional imagi ng approach could have important applications for personalized selection of che motherapy for cancer care. A pilot project is currently being conducted to test biodynamic imaging for the efficacy of cancer treatment of esophageal cancer. Over ten pa tients have been enrolled to dat e in the clinical study, all patients presenting with esophageal cancer. Pinch biopsies are acquired at the tim e o f d i a g n o s i s a n d p a r t s a r e s e l e c t e d f o r biodynamic assessment. A biopsy is divided into 32 samples tha t are immobilized in multi-well plates, while maintaining sample tissue health. The therapies tested in this study are cisplatin + 5FU versus carboplatin + Taxol. The combination therapies and the monotherapies are tes ted in parallel, along w ith negative controls. The data consist of a 4 hour baseline to establish the baseline Doppler spectrum. After the drug is applied, the samples are monitored for 9 hours. The change in the Doppler s pectra are converted to drug-response spectrograms, which are analyzed for biodynamic biomarkers. Da ta analysis uses princip le of feature vectors and clustering to identify samples with positive (beneficial) r esponse to therapy relative to samples with negative (nonbeneficial) resp onse to therapy. In this esophage al trial, a comparison is made between the two combination therapies, each containing platinum. In all enroll ment cases, the patients were given carboplatin + Taxol along with radiation therapy. Ongoing studies will cor relate biodynamic biomarkers against the clinical outcome to test the ability for biodynamic profiling t o select cancer chemotherapy.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), are an example of a family of extracellular zinc-dependent endopept idases that regulate the microenvironment around epithelial cells. Their role in cancer is not only constrained to extracellular matrix degradation for tumor invasion, but also play key roles in signaling pathway regulation. MMP3/stromelysin-1 is an MMP that functions during breast development and cancer progression. To date, MMP3 transcript expression has been detected in the stromal cells in the mammary gland but in both the epithelial and stromal cells in breast cancer. To assess MMP3 localization, we are currently staining normal mammary glands and mammary tumor tissue sections by immunohistochemistry. The role of stromal and epithelial MMP3 has no t been distinguished in published studies. To determine the requirement for MMP3 in breast cancer progression, we transplanted mammary epithelial cancer cells (V 0PyMT) into the mammary glands of MMP3 knockout and heterozygous syngeneic mice. We quantified the tumor burden of both primary and me tastastic tumors over ti me and discovered that elimination of stromal MMP3 increased the primary tumor burden, suggesting an inhi bitory role for stromal M M P 3 i n c a n c e r p r o g r e s s i o n . T h i s d a t a s u g g e s t t h a t stromal MMP3 inhibits, but is not required for, the development of the primary breast tumor. However, in contrast to our primary tu mor data, we interestingly discovered that stromal MMP3 was required for visibl e lung metastases. We ar e determining if stromal MMP3 affects the tumor cells' abilit y to enter the bloodstream by tail vein injecting MMP3 Het and KO mice to assess if macrometastasis is due to intravasation or post-intravasation effe cts during the metastatic cascade. This study will help to elucidate new mechanisms through which MMP3 functions within particular microenvironmental contexts during breast cancer progression.

Science Graduate #43 INHIBITING THE TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACT IVATION FUNCTION OF ONCOGENIC ETS FACTORS IN PROSTATE TUMORS Taylor Nicholas1 1 Biology, Bloomington, IN Email: taynick@indiana.edu The ETS family of proteins is comprised of 27 transcription fac tors that bind DNA via a conserved DNA binding domain. Four of these factors\u2014ERG, ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5 \u2014make up the oncogenic ETS class, as expression of these factors promote prostate cancer phenotyp es. The goal of my project is to identify a way to inhibit the function of these oncogenic ETS factors, without affecting other ETS family members. We recently identified a co-activator that spec ifically interacts with the four oncogenic ETS proteins, but not other ETS family members. This ETS/co-activator interaction promotes prostate cancer phenotypes such as migration, clonogenic survival, and tumor formation. Therefore, our overall objective is to identify and develop a specific inhibitor of the ETS/co-activator interactio n to treat the 50-70% of prostate cancer patients with ETS positive tumors. We have already determined the region of ERG and ETV5 essential for co- activator binding. My preliminary data indicates a broad region of the co-activator required for ERG binding. To determine a minimum interaction region, I am preforming a va riety of purified protein pull down assays with co-activator truncations a nd point mutations. The minimum interaction region of t he co-activator will be used in an Alpha-LISA drug scre en to determine candidate inhibi tors ETS/co-activator interactions. Basic Science Graduate StudentPOSTER #44 ADAR3 INHIBITS RNA EDITING AT THE Q/R SITE OF GLURB TRANSCRIPTS THOUGH DIRECT BINDING Anderson2, And Developmental Biol ogy , Indiana University, Bloomington, IN 2 Medical Science, School Of Medicine , Indiana University , Bloomington, IN 3 Department Of Neurosurgery, Indiana University, Indianapolis , IN 4 Goodman Campbell Brain And Spine, Indianapolis , IN 5 Medical Science, School Of Medici ne, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN Email: ekoakes@indiana.edu RNA editing is a naturally occur ring cellular process in which RNA-editing enzymes modify transcripts in a site-specific matter. Cancer tra nscriptomes often exhibit alter ed RNA editing and several editing events have been directly linked to cancer progression. Editing at one aden osine of a transcript en coding the glutamate receptor subunit B (GluRB) changes the amino acid encoded from glutamine to arginine, t hus this is referred to as the Q/R site. This modification alters the calcium permea bility of the glutamate receptor, having profound effects on cellular phy siology. 100% of GluRB transcri pts are edited in the human brain; and, loss of editing at this site results in death of the organism. Interest ingly, a reduction of GluRB editing has been observed in glioblastoma patients and has been shown to contrib ute to increased tumorigenesis. However, a reduction in GluRB editing does not directly correlate with a r eduction in the expression level of its primary editing enzyme, ADAR2. The goal of these studies is to identify cellular factors that regulate editing of GluRB and to determine the molecu lar mechanism of that regulati on. Recently, an ina ctive ADAR family member in C. elegans has been shown to regulate RNA editing; interestingly, humans express an inactive ADAR family member as well, ADAR 3. We hypothesized that ADAR3 m ay regulate RNA editing in humans, focusing on editing of GluRB mRNA, as defects in its ed iting status have been implicated in glioblastoma progression. Overexpressing ADAR3 in a gliobl astoma-derived l ow endogenous expressi on of ADAR3, we have monitored RNA editing of Glu RB transcripts. We have establ ished that ADAR3 expression inhibits RNA editing in U87 and NHA cell lin es. To interrogate the biolo gical mechanism of ADAR3 inhibition of RNA editing, I took a two-pronge d approach, expressing ADAR3 wi th mutations in annotated domains to determine its mode of action a nd immunoprecipitating ADAR3 to e lucidate protein and RNA interactions. Our findings indicate that the dsRNA binding domains of ADAR3 a re required for inhibition of RNA editing and that ADAR3 binds directly to GluRB mRNA transcripts. As the GluRB transcript is specifically edited by ADAR2 at the Q/R site, we suggest that ADAR3 directly competes w i t h A D A R 2 f o r b i n d i n g t o G l u R B transcript, inhibiting RNA editing. To investigate the clinical relevance of these findings, we measured ADAR2 and ADAR3 expression and GluRB editing in 10 glioblastoma tumors and matched adjacent brain tissue. We found that GluRB editing is reduced and that ADAR3 i s overexpressed in many of the tumor samples compared to the normal adjacent tissue, suggesting aber rant ADAR protein expression in glioblastoma tumors that is correlated with reduced GluRB editi ng. Our results suggest that the relative level of ADAR3 and ADAR2 protein expression in glioblastoma tumors ca n together influence the level of GluRB editing. Basic Science Graduate StudentPOSTER #45 METHIONINE RESTRICTION ALTERS FUNCTIONAL POLARIZATION OF MACROPHAGES IN MURINE MODEL OF PROSTATE CANCER Ashley Orillion1, Remi Adelayie-Ogala, Luigi Fontana 1 Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, IN Email: aorillio@iu.edu Background: Epidemiological studies link pro state cancer (CaP) to dietary i ntake. Recent research has shown that individuals consuming a Western diet, high in protein, hav e higher circulating IGF- 1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) which feeds into the nutrient sensing mTOR pathway. T his evolutionarily conserved pathway is central to the development of advanced stage and castration res istant CaP. Our previous published studies have shown that dietary protein restriction inhibits tumor grow th via mTOR pathway alteration and reduces circulating IGF-1 levels in vivo . The current study hypothesizes that dietary methionine restri ction will alter the functionality of immune cells enhancing the ability of the immune system to respond to cancerous insults. Methods: Mice were fed low (7% protein) or control protein (21% protein) diets. In a prevention study mice consumed modified diets for four weeks prior to being inoculate d with CaP tumors. In a simultaneous intervention study mice were inoc ulated with CaP tumors first t hen four weeks later were placed on the modified diets. Results: In the low protein diet group, we observed that pro-tumor M2 p olarized macrophages were significantly reduced in the tumor microenvironment (TME) for b oth prevention (p=0.012) and intervention diet (p=0.0003) studies as compared to the control diet, in add ition to observation of mTOR inhibition and IGF-1 reduction. Besides protein content in diet, we also analy zed the amino acid composition. Multiple groups have shown that methionine restriction (MR) inhibits mTO R activation, alters the immune system, and prolongs the survival of rodents. The mechanism by which MR imp acts the innate immune system is still poorly understood. In our preliminary in vitro studies, we observed that modification of a single amino acid (AA), such as methionine, is sufficient to inhibit activation o f both the mTOR pathway and M2 polarization (Arginase1 qRT-PCR of two samples in quadruplicate (p=0.0732)), while increasing the presence of M1 macrophage marker iNOS (p=0.2689) i n bone marrow derived macrop hages (BMDMs). Thus , we hypothesize that modulating specific amino acids in the diet is sufficient to alter macrophage expression of M1/M2 characteristics, and the ir functions in the TME. Conclusions: Preliminarily data shows that a ltering one specific AA intricat ely linked to the mTOR pathway is sufficient to change macrophage polarization status both at the protein and gene expression levels, suggesting that dietary alteratio n of a single AA is capable of altering macrophage function. The results of the study provide the basis for trans lational use of dietary means to alter the immune system and improve the therapeutic effects of immunotherapies.

Novel anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapies ha ve been shown to effectively overcome tumor avoidance of immune surveil lance in several tumor types including renal cell carc inoma. Our group has recently shown that the selective class I HDAC inhibitor entinostat is effective in s uppressing regulatory T cells and enhancing immunotherapies in murine renal and prostat e models, RENCA and Myc-Cap respectively. In this study we have evaluated the combination o f entinostat with an anti-PD-1 antibody in the RENCA renal cell carcinoma model. Methods: 32 BALB/c female mice were implanted with the syngenic, orthoto pic, renal cell carcinoma mouse model, RENCA - luciferase tagged - at day -8. Treatment (8 mice /group) with anti-mouse-PD-1 (aPD-1; 10mg/kg twice a week, I.P.), en tinostat (5mg/kg 5 days a week), or combination of the two was begun at day 1. Bioluminescence imaging was performed at days -1, 9 and 19 t o assess the orthotopic tumor growth. End point tumor weights were take n to assess the effect of combinat ion treatment. Results: Analysis of tumor growth showed a reduction of bioluminescence across the three time points in the combination group as compared to the vehicle and single agent t reatments. Additionally, end point analysis of tumor weights revealed an overa ll reduction in the size of the tumors in the entinostat/anti-mPD-1 combination group (88% inhibition) as compared to the inhibition)(p=0.0181), and entinostat alone (63% inhibition)(p=0.0481) gro ups. Examination of the status of the infiltrating immune cells of the tumor microenvironment via flo w cytometry, qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and/or immunofluorescence analysis is ong Conclusions: Our preliminary results suggest that the immunomodulatory activ ity of the selective class I HDAC inhibitor entinostat may enhance the antitumor effect of P D-1/PD-L1 inhibition and provide the rationale for the clinical testi ng of this novel combination in patients with RCC. Basic Science Graduate StudentPOSTER #47 MECHANISMS OF DIVERGENT ONCOGE NIC FUNCTIONS OF THE HIGHLY HOMOLOGOUS ETS FACTOR S, ETS1 AND ETS2. Joshua Plotnik1 1 Genome, Cellular, And Developmenta l Biology , Department Of Biolog y, Indiana University Bloomington, Bloomington, IN Email: jplotnik@indiana.edu ETS1 and ETS2 are homologous and ubiquitous downstream effector s of RAS/ERK signaling. Some studies find a common oncogenic function for ETS1 and ETS2, while other s indicate that ETS2 is a tumor suppressor. However, no mechanistic basis for differences between ETS1 and ETS2 is known. We recently found that ETS1 promotes oncogenic phenotypes such as cell migration in pr ostate cancer cells, while ETS2 represses these phenotypes. We have ide ntified ce. RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, using ificity, indicate that ETS1 a nd ETS2 bind the same targets but regulate genes in opposite directions. Chimeric dissection of ETS2 ident ified a repression domain that mediates a specific co-represso r interaction that is not conserved in ET S1. Importantly, this co-repressor is highly expressed in cancers where ETS2 is a tumor suppressor and at lo w levels in cancers where ETS2 is an oncogene, thus providing a potential explanation for diverging functions.

Elevated levels of YBX1 protein are observed in a va riety of cancers, making it an excellent marker as well as a potential therapeutic target in c ancer. The connection between YBX1 and the important nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) however has never b een previously reported. Here, we show that overexpression of wild type YBX1 (wtYBX1) activates N F-kB, suggesting that YBX1 is a potential NF-kB activator. Furthermore, using mass spectrometry analysis, we identified novel phosphorylation of serine 165 (S165) on YBX1. Overexpression of the S165A-YBX1 mutant in either 293 cells or colon cancer HT29 cells showed dramatic reduction in NF-kB activation as compared to that of wtYBX1, confirming that S165 phosphorylation is critical for the activation of NF-kB by YBX1. We further show that expression of the S165A-YBX1 mutant dramat ically decreased the expression of downstream NF-kB-inducible genes, reduced cell growth, and compromised tumorigenic ability in colon cancer cells, as compared to wtYBX1. Taken together, we provide the first evidence that YBX1 functions as a tumor promoter via NF-kB activation, and phosphorylation of S165 of YBX1 is critical for this function. Theref ore, our important discovery may lead to blocking S165 phosphorylation as a potential therapeutic strategy in colon ca ncer patients.

At death, roughly 73% of women with b reast cancer have bone metast ases, which are incurable. Therefore, understanding what drives cancer to metastasize to bone and ide ntifying treatments that eliminate bone metastasis are essentia l to improving the survival and quality of life of cancer patients with metastasis to bone. The current methods used to study bone metastasis are restricted to in vitro tissue culture models and to in vivo animal models, both of which have several limitations. The in vitro tissue cultures lack the 3-D environment of heterogeneous cell types of the bone and marrow, and in vivo animal models often are limited by the confounding primary tumor burden and also are not applicable to rapid screening aimed at targeting bone metastases. In this interdisciplinary project, we use a novel bone bioreact or to culture mouse bone explants, study bone metastases, and develop therapies to help breast cancer patients that have developed bone metastases. The objective of this research is to develop an experimental s ystem that preserves the 3-D environment and heterogeneous culture conditi ons (bone, marrow, and cancer cells) within the physiological context of an intact bone environment and app ly the technology to develop faster screening techniques than the ones availa ble in current animal models We propose to use this model to understand fundamental questions of bone metastases and to test therapies prior to use in patients. We will validate the bioreactor as a means to understand the stages of metastatic tumor colonization, progression, and response to therapies. After validation in a murine model, our bioreactor will make it possib le to study metastatic cancer progression temporally and independently from primary tumor growth. Later, we will use the bo ne bioreactor to study the effects on human bone coming from human orthopaedic surgical procedures. Because this system is amenable for investigating bone colonization by multiple cancer types, this st udy also has general application beyond breast cancer. Due the usage of bone explants and vibrational technology that is currently available to patients, this study has high translational value. Basic Science Graduate StudentPOSTER #50 TUMOR DERIVED IL6 Teresa 1 Biochemistry And Molecular Biology, Indianapolis, IN 2 Biochemistry And Molecular Biology, Surgery, Indianapolis, IN Email: jerupert@iupui.edu Cachexia, or weight loss in cancer, increases morbidity and mortality. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), >85% of patients will suffer weight loss with many dying of cachexia. Interleukin-6 (IL6) is increased in the blood of patients with PDAC and correlates with weight loss and mortality. PDAC tumors often stain heavily for IL6 in strom al cells, with a subset exhibiting staining within tumor cells. IL6 is part of the IL6 family of c ytokines and induces signaling by binding its specific a-receptor and the ligand receptor complex then bi nds to the gp130 receptor on cell membranes, causing transphosphoryl ation of the Janus Kinase. Th ree primary pathways are activated by IL6, including STAT3, ERK, and PI3K/Akt. This stud y aims to investigate the role of tumor-derived IL6 and subsequent a ctivation of the STAT3 pathwa y in PDAC cachexia. a murine model of PDAC cachexia using orthotop ic injection of tumor cells isolated from the genetic PDAC model LSL- KrasG12D:LSL-Tr p53R172H:Pdx1- Cre (KPC). Tumors derived from diverse KPC cell lines induce muscle wasting and increase cachexia associated with increased IL6 expression levels. Notably, the KPC32908 cell line expresse s the greatest amount of IL6 compared to wildtype cells. To determine the roles of tumor-cel l-derived IL6 in PDAC cachexia, the Il6 gene in KPC32908 cells was mutated using CRISPR/Cas9 to induce loss of expression. DNA sequencing of the CRISPR target si te verified mutagenesis. QPCR verified substantial reduction in Il6 mRNA expression (>80% decrease) in the KPC-IL6 Null (IL6 null) clone. Western blotting showed conditioned media (CM) f rom KPC32908 parental (KPCp) and CRISPR Negative Control (CNC) cells increased phosphorylat ion of STAT3 in mouse myotube s, while IL6 null CM did not. Mean minimum myotube diameter after treatment with KPCp, CNC CM was significantly less than those treated inject ed with KPCp and CNC cells versus those injected with IL6 null cells had a significant loss of average fat (-48.8%; -30.6 %; -13.5% +7.02% respectively, p<0.001) measure d with Echo MRI and significantly reduced muscle mass versus IL6 null (Gastrocnemius: -32.9%; increased in KPCp and CNC groups versus the IL6 null gr of and CNC groups was mark versus IL6 null group. Moreo ver, tumor-derived IL6 could be required for both cachexia and tumor growth as the KPCp and CNC groups had significantly larger normalized tumor mass compared to the IL6 null group (0.10; 0.0 4; 0.01 respectively, p<0.01). These results suggest a reducti on in the cachexiogenic potentia l of IL6 null tumor cells.

ERG activates a transcrip tional program responsible for cell migration, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), angiogenesis, and c ell survival. Expression of ERG coupled with constitutive activation of the PI3 K pathway results in the tran sition from prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia to invasive adenocarcinoma. However, the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for this transition are not well understood. In the present s tudy, we have identified a mec hanism in which phosphorylation of ERG leads to dissociation of and increased Phosphonull mutants exhibit a stronge r association with the co-repre ssor, diminished ability to activate target genes, and loss of cell migration. In order to identify genome wide targets of ERG and the transcriptional co- repressor, Immunoprec ipitation with massively paralle sequencing (ChIP-seq) was conducted on the ERG phophonull mutant. In a related study, we have preliminary evidence which suggests that our identified transcripti onal co-repressor switches to a transcriptional co-activator upon phosphorylation. We are currently performing bi ochemical and functional assays t o further investigate th e relationship of ERG with this co-repressor and its effect on transcription and onco genic activity. Overall this study provides insight to the signaling pathways responsi ble for oncogenic activity of ERG positive prostate cancer.

Pathways don't perf orm alone; they interact with each other through the overlapping genes. This phenomenon is known a s crosstalk of pathways. The aim of the study is develop a methodology to find the highly interacting (cross-talk) immune-oncological pathways and their drug-gene-pat hway modules er validated in-vivo using Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) as a cas e study. The reference pathway cr oss-talk matrix is built using the KEGG Knowledgebase, which consists of the 302 KEGG pathways ass ociated with 6996 genes. The LUAD gene expression data availa ble in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is used for the study. The data of 32 patients was used in the study and of these, 9 p atients were treated with immunotherapy drugs. A set of 3018 significant genes associated with 296 pathways [ C.I. =95%, p-value <=0.05] are identified in this dataset, and a disease crosstal k matrix is constructed. Each cell in the matrix gives the cross-talk score of the pathways comput ed using the formula: .

O bese adipose tissue has been shown to have increased methylation levels due to increased DNMT1 lev els and activity. We have previously shown that combinati on treatment of high-grade serou s ovarian cancer cells with a DNMT1 inhibitor (either decit abine or guadecitabine/SGI-110) pl us cisplatin treatment reduced tumor progression by hypomethyla ting promoters and re-expressin g tumor suppressor genes in vivo and in high-grade serous ovarian cancer clinical trials. Based on these observations, it was of interest to test whether DNMT1 inhibition could reverse adipocy te methylation, alter adipokine secretion, and decrease migratio n and invasion of ovarian cance r cells towards adipocytes. Methods: Adipocytes (control) SKOV3, Kuramochi, OVCAR4, or OVCAR8 ovarian cancer cel ls were seeded in Boyden migration and invasion chambers and allowed to move towards adi pocytes for 8 and 16h, respectively. EMT marker expression (SLUG, fibronectin, and TWI ST1) was assessed by qRT-PCR. Adipocyte-conditioned media was us ed to culture ovarian cancer cells in clonogenicity assay and a human adipokine array (R&D Systems) was performed. Results: Guadecitabine treatment of decreased and OVCAR8 (35% and 40%, respectively, compared to control), and a 50% decrease ( P<0.05) in invasion towards adipocytes after guadecitabine treatment was o bserved for OVCAR4, OVCAR8, and Kuramochi cells. Expression of EMT markers SLUG, n, and TWIST1 decreased 1.8-fold increase, respective ly) was observed based on adipokine array and verified by qRT-PCR. Treatment with recombinant TIMP3 (50nM) decreased adipokine secretio n resulting in decreased cancer cell migration and invasion.

Chan2,3, Mervin C. Yoder1,2 1 Biochemistry And Molecular Biology, Indianapolis, IN 2 Herman B Well Centre For Pedi atric Research, Indianapolis, IN 3 Medical And Molecular Genetics, Indianapolis, IN Email: tarn@iupui.edu Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia (JMML) is a fatal pediatric neoplasm (MPN) that can arise in utero . clonal origin within hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) that acquire somatic mutation s in the GM-CSF signaling pathway. The LoxP-STOP-LoxP PTPN11E76K mouse is a validated model of this disease. Following Cre mediated recombination, PTPN11E76K/+ mice recapitulate the two defining molecular features of JMML: i) growth hypersensitivity of myelo id progenitors to GM-CSF and ii) hyperactive RAS-ERK signaling. However, previous studie s have expressed PTPN11E76K in overlapping hematopoietic lineages with near-complete effic iency. As a result, previous work has not addressed the clonal origin of JM ML. Furthermore, the contribution of individual developmental lineages to JMML is un known. In this report, we describe an inducible mouse model that uniquely activates the P TPN11E76K mutation in 3 distinct hematopoietic lineages with near-clonal efficiency. The colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) is expressed o n differentiated myeloid cells and its signaling is crucial for their differenti ation, proliferation, and survival. Fortuitously, CSF1R is also expressed on HSPCs at distinct deve lopmental stages, i n c l u d i n g y o l k s a c E M P s , f e t a l l i v e r H S C s , a n d a d u l t H S C s . U s i n g the inducible CSF1R Mer-Cre-Mer+ ROSAYFP/+ mice, we validated that tamoxifen-injection at E8.5, at E14.5, and at 5week of age could activate 25% of EMPs, 1.0% of fetal liver HSCs, and 1.0% of adult HSCs, respectively. To evaluate the clonal contributions PTPN11E76K in adult HSCs following tamoxifen injection at 5 weeks of age. Gen omic PCR analysis confirmed that YFP+ cells expressed the PTPN11E76K construct, whereas YFP- cells expressed only PTPN11WT. Peripheral blood analysis showed CYE mice have increased YFP+ cells and that these cells are skewed towards the CD11b+ m yeloid lineage compared to littermate YFP- HSPCs, had growth hypersensitivity an d hyperactive RAS-ERK signaling - the two defining features of JMML. Finally, CBC ana lysis of CYE animals showed progressively increasing leukocyte counts, demonstrating progression of MPN and suggesting that these animals will succumb to their disease. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that timed injection of tam oxifen in CSF1R Mer-Cre-Mer+ animals results in near-clonal HSPC labelling in distinct hematopoietic lineages. Furthermo re, we show this syst em can be used to model clonal MPN development using a defined JMML mutation: PTPN11E76K. Finally, our system allows the study of interactions between mutant and normal hema topoiesis in the same mouse by comparing YFP+ and YFP- cells. Given these characteris tics, our CYE model will address the distinct developmental contributions of yolk sac EM Ps, fetal liver HSCs, and adult HSCs to disease developme nt in our JMML mouse model.

An important mechanism of immune evasion is represented by epigenetic silencing of tumor antigens (NY- ESO-1, Muc16 and MAGE). We hypo thesize that reversing DNA methylation, DNA methyl transfera se inhibitors (DNMTIs) restore the expression of such antigens, potentiating anti-tumor immune r esponse. The targeting of immun e checkpoints regulat ed by programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) signaling represents a novel therapeutic strategy in cancer, including in OC. Here we set out to measure the anti-tumor effects of epigenetic priming in combination with PD-1/PDL-1 blockade in OC preclinical models. Methods The ID8 intraperitoneal (ip) immunocompetent syngeneic mouse model was used to measure the effects of the novel DNMTI guadecitabine (SG I-110, Astex Pharmaceuticals I nc) and PDL1 blockade. The experimental groups consisted of non-specific IgG antibody (n=6 mice/group, 3 week treatment). I mmune cells collected from the ascites and spleens of tumor bearing mice were either directly p rocessed or co-cultured with ID8 cells fo r 48 hours. Cells were immuno-phenotyped by flow cytometry. In OC cells treated with guadecitabine, change s in gene expression were analyzed by real time-PCR. Results Combination of PD1 blockade w ith guadecitabine significantly decreased primary tumor formation (P<0.05) and malignant ascites accumula tion (P<0.0001) compared with the control group in ID8 tumor bearing mice. CD8+ cells isolated from ascites and spleens demonstrated incre ased expression of exhaustion markers (PD1+ and CTL4+) and decreased expressi on of activation markers (CD40 and MHC-I) in the control (IgG) group compared with the SGI-110 and anti-PDL1 inhibitory antibody alo ne or in combination treatment groups. Treatment with DNMTIs significantly increased the expression of tumor antigens Muc16, A11, and lines. Conclusions Guadecitabine in combination wi th anti-PDL1 antibody induced s triking anti-tumor effects immunocompetent OC syngeneic model by activating cytotoxic T-ce lls.

There are curren tly no effective medical treat ments for vestibular schwannoma, owing in part to an incomplete understa nding of the normal function of NF2 and the biochemical derangements that occur as a result of its loss. To address this, we used an shRN A kinase library to compare the relative effect of single kinase knockdowns on growth of NF2-deficient versus NF2-sufficient human meningioma cells. Of the candidates, knockdown of MAP kinase-interacting protein kinase 2 (Mnk2) achieved lowest depletion values in two separate shRNA clones. Mnk2 is known to phosphorylate eu has been correlated wi th poor outcomes in several other cancers. Relative to normal eighth cranial nerve tissue, spontaneous and NF2-associated human vestibular schwannomas demonstrated increased levels of both p-eIF4E and t otal eIF4E by western blot. We performed a genetic intercross of Nf2flox/flox;PeriostinCre mice with eIF4ES209A transgenic mice. Nf2flox/flox;PeriostinCre mice ( Nf2-deficient in the lineage) of the dorsal root ganglia and cranial nerves as well as progre ssive sensorineural hearing los s. The eIF4ES209A m o u s e s t r a i n h a s a g l o b a l point mutation of eIF4E that pr events its phosphorylation; this mutation produces no discernable phenotype. DRG volume and histology were primary readouts fo rmation. Whole tissue lysates of trigeminal were used to characterize protein levels Nf2 , p-eIF4E, and total e IF4E by western blot. Hearing thresholds were determined using click auditory brainst em response (ABR). There were no significant differences in overall survival between genotypes. Compared to Nf2-sufficient mice, 8-month-old Nf2-deficient mice had significantly increased DRG size with histo logic features of schwannoma regardless of eIF4E allele expression. Schwannomas of eIF4ES209A were significantly larger than those expressing the eIF4EWT allele. Although hearing thresh olds were significantly increas ed in Nf2-deficient mice expressing the eIF4EWT allele compared to their Nf2-sufficient controls, this difference was not present in the eIF 4ES209A mice based on the presence of Nf2. While we cannot exclude the po ssibility that Mnk2 has eIF4E-i ndependent effects in Nf2-deficient cells, our data sugges t that abolishment of eIF4E ph osphorylation is not sufficient to prevent schwannoma formation . Basic Science Medical StudentPOSTER #58 RECOMBINANT DEK ENHANCES THE EX VIVO EXPANSION OF HUMAN AND MOUSE HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELLS IN A CXCR2- Email: malcapit@iupui.edu DEK is a nuclear DNA-binding protein that has been implicated in the regulation of transcription, chromatin remodeling, and mRNA processing. Endo genous DEK regulates hematopoiesis, as bone mice manifest increased hematopo ietic progenitor cell (HPC) numbers and cycling status and decreased long-term (LT) and secondary hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) engrafting capability (Broxmeyer et al., 2012, Brox meyer et al., 2013). We now show that rmDEK is myelosuppressive in vitro in an S-phase specific manner and reversibly decreases numbers (~2 fold) and cycling status of HPC in vivo , with DEK-/- mice being more sensitive than control mice to this suppression. In contrast, in vivo administration of rmDEK to wild type and DEK-/- mice enhanced numbers of phenotypic LT-HSC. This suggests that exogenous DEK may enhance HSC numbers by blocking production of HPCs. We t hus assessed effects of DEK on the ex vivo expansion of human CD34+ cord blood (CB) and mouse Lin- BM cells stimulated with SCF, Flt3 ligand, and TPO. significantly enhanced ex vivo expansion of HSC by ~3 fold when compared to cells expanded without DEK. As rmDEK can bind to heparin su lfate proteoglycans (HSPG), become internalized, and then remodel cells in vitro (Kappes et al., 2011; Saha et al., 2013), we assessed effects of DEK on the hete rochromatin marker H3K9Me3 in the nucleus of mouse cKit+ (LSK) BM cells by imaging flow cytome try. DEK enhanced the presence of H3K9Me3 in the nucleus of DEK-/- LSK cells, indicating that rmDEK can be internalized by LSK cells and mediate heterochromatin formation. Neutralizi ng HSPG blocked the inhibitory effect of rmDEK on colony formation as well as the expansion of HSC in ex vivo expansion assays. Upon finding that DEK has a Glu-Leu-Arg (ELR) motif, similar to that of CXC chemokines such as IL-8, we hypothesized that DEK may manifest at least some of its action s through CXCR2, the receptor known to bind and mediate the actions of IL-8 and MIP-2. First, we confirmed expression of CXCR2 on the surface of HSC and HPC and then determined if neutralizing CXCR2 ock DEK's function in vitro with rmDEK, colony formation. with neutralizing CXCR2 antibodies blocked the inhibitory effect of these proteins. Blocking the ability of DEK to bind to CXCR2 also inhibited the expansion of HSC in an ex vivo expansion assay. This suggests that DEK binds to CXCR2, HSPG or both to mediate its function on HPC and HSC, enhancing HSC but decreasing HPC numbers. Therefore, DEK may be a crucial regulatory determinant of HSC/HPC function an d fate decision that is utilized to enhance ex vivo expansion of HSC.

Androphy 1,2, # 1 Department of Dermatology, 2 Department of Microbiology and I mmunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA; 3 Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA Mammalian DNA replication is initiated by the origin recognitio n complex (ORC) and mediated by the pre-replication complex (p re-RC). The papillomavirus (PV) g enome is maintained as a double stranded DNA episome in infected cells. To initiate replication , the viral E2 protein binds to and recruits the E1 DNA helicase at the viral origin. The PV genome replication program is linked to the life cycle of the host and involves three stages: initial ampli fication from a single episome to a few copies per cell, a cell cycle linked maintenance phase, and a d ifferentiation dependent late stage where the genome is amplified to thousands of copies. The role of ORC and other pre-RC factors during PV replication had yet to be elucidated. We demonstrate that human (HPV-31) and bovine (BPV-1) E2 proteins bind to the ORC2 protein but not ORC1. E2 b ound ORC2 directly and E1 was excluded from this complex. Surprisingly, the ORC2 protein was not detected at the HPV origin in cells that maintained HPV-31 and HPV-16 episomes. SiRNA and sh RNA knockdown in both HPV-31 and BPV-1 transient repl ication HPV-16 ORC2 silenc ing also enhanced HPV-31 replication in keratinocytes upo n differentiation. To investiga te the biological implications of E2 binding to ORC2, we observed that ORC2 occupancy at a known mam malian origin of replication was impaired in cells that stably expressing HPV-31 and HPV-16 E2 proteins compared to their parental controls. Our data suggest that E2 interaction with OR C2 protein does not serve to activate E1 and E2 dependent viral licensing; rather high levels of E2 t hat occur during differentiation dependent amplification can restrict pre-ORC assembly at mammal ian origins that would otherwise effectively compete for host replication complexes.

Overcoming drug-resistance and specifically targeting cancer st em cells (CSC) represent major challenges in high grade serous o varian cancer (HGSOC) treatmen t. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a growth factor (an oncolipid) for HGSOC. Responses to LPA are me diated primarily by their plasma membrane bound G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs; LPAR 1-6). In addition, LPA has been identified as a ligand for the nuclear rec eptor peroxisome proliferator-ac tivated receptor gamma (PPAR \u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf). Through genetic, cell biological, and biochemical analyses, we revealed novel LPA regulatory roles in EOC side population (SP) cells (capable of excluding Hoechst 33342 outside the cells), which have been shown to be an enriched source of CSC and progenitor cells in EOC. LPA significantly increased SP and CD44+CD117+ double positive cell populations in HGSOC cell lines PE01, PE0 4, and OVCAR3. LPA dose- and time-dependently up- regulated the zinc transporte r ZIP4 (gene name Slc39a4) in these cell lines. Regulation of ZIP4 expression was exclusively studied in the context of zinc previ ously. Other factors regulating ZIP4 expression are essentially unknown. We have revealed that LPA is a novel regulator of ZIP4 in HGSOC, which is mediated by PPAR \u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf. We have established ZIP4- and PPAR\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\u00bf-knockout PE04 and OVCAR3 cell lines using facilitate RNA-guided site-specific DNA cleavage (CRISPR) system. ZIP4 was functional ly in CSC-related activities including proliferati on, anoikis-resistance, colony- formation, spheroid-formation, drug- resistance, and LPA-induced in cells. Importantly, ZIP 4-KO blocked ~ 90% of LPA's effect on SP. In summary, LPA and ZIP4 were involved in CSC-like activ ities XERODERMA PIGMENTOSUM A FOR CANCER THERAPY Gavande1, Pamela VanderVere-Carozza1, Tyler Vernon1, Katherine Pawelczak, John Turchi1 1 Medicine, Indianapolis, IN Email: ngavande@iupui.edu Targeting DNA repair and the DNA damage response for cancer the rapy has recently gained increasing attention with inhibitors of the PARP enzyme showing a therapeutic efficacy in various cancers. Th e utility of DNA repair inhibito rs can be expanded by their use in combination treatment with DNA damaging chemotherapeutics. D uring the course of our ongoing research, we have identified NER inhibitors targeting t he DNA binding activity of the Xeroderma Pigmentosum Group A (XPA) protein, a critical com ponent for both transcription coupled and global genomic NER. In addition, XPA protein is required for the removal of all types of DNA lesio ns repaired by NER. Clinical v alidation of XPA has been obtained where high expression of XPA in lung, ovarian and lung cancer results in decreased efficacy of platinum therapy. Considering the importa nce of XPA in the DNA damage recognition process and the potential to enhance the the rapeutic efficacy of platinum based anticancer drugs, we have identified X-80 class of compounds in the original screen and it displayed reasonable potency in fluoresc ence polarization DNA binding assays. More recent struc ture activity re lationships (S AR) of this class of compounds has identified a series of drug-like analogs that dis play a >50-fold increase in potency and excellent specificit y. Analyses of the SARs define the chemical and structural features that impact the interaction with XPA, cellular permeab ility and contribute to selectivity. Data demonstrate that the X80 class of inhibitors do not interact with DNA but directly bind the XPA protein. These data demonstrate the poten tial in developing novel adjuvant anticancer therapeutics that target XPA-DNA interactio ns. Further structure-activity relationships (SAR) of lead compound is underway to develop hig hly potent XPA inhibitors for preclinical settings.

Gemcitabine is still the fi rst-line treatment for patients with PDAC, and its combination with albumin-bound paclitaxel ha s shown clear therapeutic advantage. We hypothesize that strategies to increase gemcitabi ne sensitivity may be effective in PDAC treatment. In this study, we report that cancer stem ce ll regulator Sox2 is highly induced in acquired gemcitabine resistant pancre atic cell lines , sensitizes cells to gemci tabine treatment both in the cu l t u r e d c e l l s a n d i n m o u s e models. Down-regulation of Gli1/2 was associated with reduced S ox2 expression, decreased expression of cancer stem cell markers. We found Gli1/2 protein s in association with a Sox2 promoter sequence with a putative Gli binding site, suggesting a direct regulation of Sox2 by Gli1/2. We furt her sh owe d t hat dow n- regula tion of Gli1 or G li2 was as effective as Sox2 knockdown in sensitizing cancer cells to gemcitabine treatment. The relevance of Gli1/2-Sox2 signaling axis to PDAC was shown by the association of high Sox 2 expression with poor survival in stage II PDAC patients.

Like Mdm2, MdmX, is a RING containin g protein, yet it lacks intrinsic E3 ligase function. Mdm 2 has been shown to facilitate ubiquitination as a monomer, a homodimer, and as a heterodimer with MdmX depending on the ce llular stress. Our recent report establishes that under growth conditions that act ivate Src, Mdm2 functions as a necessary forMdm2 to nedd ylate p53 has yet to be shown. Here we demonstrate that Src phosphorylation results in increased levels of MdmX, increased binding between Mdm2 and MdmX, and increased ne ddylation of MdmX and p53. Interestingly, the lack of MdmX (in transient assays o r in shRNA cell lines) results in decreased neddylation of p53. These data support a critical role for MdmX as part of the Mdm2 neddylating complex.

Poor 5-year survival rates (<30%) are due to presentation of most women at diagnosis with advanced stage disease with widely disseminated intraperitoneal metastasis. Ho wever, when diagnosed before metastatic propagation the overall 5-year survival rate is >90%. Metastasizing tumor cells grow rapidly and aggressively attach to the mesotheliumof all organs within the peritoneal cavity, including the parietal peritoneum and the om entum, producing secondary lesions.Mesothelin (MSLN), a 40kDa glycoprotein that is over ex pressed in many cancers including ovarian and mesotheliomas is suggested to play a role in cell survival, proliferation, tumor progression and adherence. However, the bi ological function of mesothelin is not fully understood as MSLN knockout mice do not present with an abnormal phenotype. Conversely, MSLN has been shown to bind to the ovari an cancer antigen, CA- 125, and thought to play a role in the peritoneal diffusion of ovarian tumor cells. Taking into consideration the potential importance of MSLN/CA-125 binding i n ovarian tumor metastasis within the peritoneum, MSLN wild type (WT) and knock out (KO) mice were used to explore the role of mesothelin on the susceptibility of ovar ian tumor cells to adhere to the mesothelium of the organs in the peritoneal cavity. An e x vivo peritoneal assay, using CA- 125 positive human ovarian tumor cells OVCAR8-GFP and peritonea l explants from MSLN WT and KO mice demonstrated a decrease in OVCAR8-GFP cell adhes ion to peritoneal t i s s u e s f r o m M S L N K O m i c e c o m p a r e d t o M S L N W T m i c e .

Disease progression was evaluated post injection by fluorescent in vivo imaging prior to end point dissection (~8 weeks). Abdominal organs were dissected, imaged ex vivo and organ-specifi c tumor burden was quantified by tumor area. Tumor burden was significantly de creased in the liver and omentum of MSLNKO mice compared to MSLN WT mice. Together, the results demonstrate a loss of mesothelial cell-ovarian tumor cell adhes i o n i n t h e o m e n t u m a n d peritoneum of mice that do not express MSLN. Basic Science Post-Doctoral/Medical FellowPOSTER #65 PRECLINICAL ANALYSIS OF NOVEL SMALL MOLECULE INHIBITORS OF REPLICATION PROTEIN A (RPA), IN PATIENT DERIVED SPHEROID MODELS OF HIGH GRADE SEROUS OVARIAN CANCER Hilary Hinshaw1 1 OB/GYN, Division Of Gyneco logic Oncology, Indianapolis, IN Email: hhinshaw@iupui.edu Objectives. Three-dimensional (3D) culture models are emerging in preclinic al drug sensitivity analyses and are particularly relevant in high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), where metastatic cells often form spheroids within ascite s prior to surface deposition. The use of primary cells harvested from the ascites of patients with HGSOC also better repres ents the heterogeneity inherent to this malignancy. Platinum (Pt) based chemotherapy is a key component in the treatment of HGSOC and the formation of Pt-D NA damage ultimately induces cell death. Replication protein A (RPA) plays a crucial role in the repair of Pt-DNA adducts through the nucleotide excision repair (NER) and homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathways, which are major contributors to cellular resistance. Theref ore, we investigated the effectiveness of RPA inhibition alone and in combination with cisplati n in patient derived spheroid models of HGSOC. Methods. Malignant cells were harvested from ascites of patients with HGSOC, cultured and seeded into hanging drops, allowing spheroid formation. The anti-cancer activity of novel RPA inhibitors (RPAi) was tested alone and in combination wi th cisplatin using sequential and concurrent treatment regimens. Results. derived HGSOC cells were reliably cu ltured and spheroids were generated. IC 50 values for Pt and RPAi were variable as a function of patient origin, but values were similar to those obtained by conventional two-dimensional culture. When treated sequentially or in combination, synergy was seen with Pt and RPAi. Conclusions. Multicellular spheroids derive d from HGSOC ascites can be reliably generated for use in preclinical drug sensitivity assays. Spheroids are sensitive to Pt and RPAi. RPAi showed both single agent activity and synergy with Pt. Basic Science Post-Doctoral/Medical FellowPOSTER #66 EXPLORING THE MECHANISMS OF EPIGENETIC Victoria Duffin1, Shruthi Sriramkumar1 1 Medical Sciences, School Of Medicine, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN Email: ashley.maiuri@gmail.com Inflammation plays a pivotal role in the initiation and promoti on of cancer. Indeed, oxidative stress caused by inflammation can lead to genetic mutations and epigenetic changes that promote tumorigenesis. The genetic abnormalities leading to cancer have been well studied whereas less is known concerning the role of epigenetic changes . Interestingly, there is a global loss of DNA methylation in cancer along with concurrent hypermethylation of distinct promoter CpG islands. Hypermethylation of the promoters of tumo r suppressor genes (TSGs) can lead to their silencing ultimately contributing to c ancer. How epigenetic alterations are initiated is not known, but we hypothesize that oxidative stress caused by inflammation is involved. Accordingly, we are using a mouse mod el to test the hypothesis that inflammation causes DNA damage and recruitment of epigenetic proteins to damaged chromatin leading to silencing of genes in tumors. When Min mic e, which are heterozygous for mutant adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), are infected with the bacterium fragilis (ETBF), tumors develop in their distal colons. Preliminary results demonstrate that ETBF promotes enrichment o f epigenetic proteins at the promoters of several TSGs. Furthermore, ETBF causes genome- wide methylation changes in tumors that form at sites of inflammation. Specifica l l y , E T B F c a u s e s a g l o b a l loss of DNA methylation in tumors along with concurrent hyperme thylation of many promoter-associated CpG islands, including CpG islands associat ed with TSGs. Previous work in vitro indicated that mis match repair (MMR) proteins are involved in recruitment of epigenetic proteins to sites of DNA damage. We te sted whether this finding holds true in our mouse model. ETBF-treated mice lacking expression of the MMR pr otein Msh2 in their intestinal epithelium have reduced recruitment of epigenetic proteins to chromatin compared to ETBF-infected wildtype mice. Moreover, tumors from ETBF-infected Msh2 -deficient/Min mice had fewer DNA methylation changes compared to tumors from ETBF-infected wildtype/Min mice. These findings have begun to uncover a novel mechanism underlying inflammation-induced tumorigenesis, namely t h e i n v o l v e m e n t o f MMR machinery in promoting epige netic changes via the recruitme nt of epigenetic proteins to sites of DNA damage.

We hypothesized that Di peptidyl Peptidase 4 (DPP4), an enzyme that N terminally cleaves and modifies the function of select proteins leading to alterations in homing/engraftment of HSC, may be altered by EPHOSS and involved in EPHOSS effects on HSC. Proteomic and bioinformatics analysis identifi ed 1) many unexpected intracellular/secreted proteins with DPP4 truncation (T) sites and 2) spec ific, as well as overlapping, modifications in phosphorylated and differential pr otein signaling of T-cytokines (GM-CSF and IL-3) compared to their full length (FL) forms leading to alternative regulation of signaling/function in normal and leukemic cells. T-GM-CSF and T-IL-3 had enhanced receptor binding compared to their FL forms with significant, and reciprocal, blunting of functional activity of both factors in vitro and in vivo . To investigate effects of DPP4 on EPHOSS, and vice versa, mBM was harvested (air/ with a DPP4 inhibitor (DPA), or from DPP4 K/O mice. This resulted in significant in creases in the number of phenotypic of phenotypic LT-HSC. Also, the percentage of DPP4+ ce lls was increased in primitive we re isolated in hypoxia (p=.005). Unexpectedly, Cyclosporin A, a cylophilinD/MPTP inhibitor did not increase the number of DPP4+ cells as was seen with hypoxic harvest. Further, LT-HSC ROS levels (mitochondrial/total) were not diminished in DPA or DPP4 K/O groups harvested in air despite the increase in phenotypic LT-HSC over air harvest alone, thus suggesting a non ROS/MPTP mechanism. In conclusion, DPP4 expression/activity serves heretofore unknown roles in the regulation/signa ling of multiple protein types as well as with respect to hematopoiesis and cellular responses to EPHOSS.Basic AND BREAST CANCER David Olivos1,2, Lindsey Mayo3,4 1 Microbiology And Immunology, Indianapolis, IN 2 Indiana University School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 3 Pediatrics, Biochemistry A nd Immunology, Indianapolis, IN 4 Indiana University Simon Cancer Center, Indiana University School Of Me dicine, Indianapolis, IN Email: djolivos@iupui.edu Chemotherapy has made remarkable strides in the past century to alleviate tumor burden across most cancer types, yet it remains ine ffective at achieving complete tumor remission. To improve chemotherapy efficacy and patient survival, novel drugs will require a great er mechanistic understanding of tumor initiating cell (TIC) regulatory pathways. Intratumoral heterogeneity is a major obstacle for conventional targeted treatment modalities, which selec t for aggressive phenotypes wi th acquired drug resistance and TIC enrichment.

We observed an increase in the immunophenotyp ic expression of CD133 in ShMdm2 osteosarcoma and breast cancer cell lines by flow cytometry. O ur data provides the first evidence that loss of Mdm2 results in increased TIC population. Further analysis wil l examine the affects of TIC using small molecular inhibitors to Mdm2. This insight will contribute to the molecular foundations defining the role of Mdm2 in TIC and will determine if targeting Mdm2 therapeuticall y is a prognostic indicator for recurrence.

In bon e, tumor cells secrete soluble factors that distort an d manipulate normal bone remodeling leading to osteolytic lesions and inflammation. Cli nically, primary high-grade bone sarcomas and secondary metastatic cancers exhib it elevated levels of murine double minute 2 (Mdm2), the principal cellular antagonist and E3 ubiquitin ligase of tumor suppressor p53. We demonstrate a novel function of mdm2, independent of p53, to drive osteolytic disease influenced by t he signaling cascade of RANKL, ICAM1, and RANTES. To elucidate the direct influence of Mdm2 in cancer ce lls on osteoclast differentiation, several cell lines were created to overexpre ss or silence Mdm2. We found th at osteoblast-like osteosarcoma (MG63, T47D, BT474) lead to , and bone resorption. Co-cultures of Mdm2 over- expressing cancers and normal mon ocytes resulted in increased n umbers of osteoclasts. In cancer cell lines where Mdm2 is silenced, we observed lower number of osteoclasts . The presence of Mdm2 in cancer cells also increased osteoclast resorption in an in vitro organ model. To determine the effects of ICAM1, we used an ICAM antibody to block ICAM1 i n the media and showed a decre ase in osteoclastogenesis. Understanding the role of Mdm2 in osteoclastog enesis may be amendable to tran slational benefit in disease models of advanced bone resorpti on and bone metastases.

ATG16L1 is a core autophagy protein typically found in complex with ATG5 and ATG1 2. This complex mediates conjugation of LC3 to the dev eloping autophagophore, which is e ssential for autophagy. Many core autophagy proteins also serve non-autophagy functions such as r egulation of innate immune signaling and control of viral r eplication. A single nucleotide polymorphism in ATG16L1 encoding a Thr300Ala amino acid substituti on has been previously implicate d with an increased risk for the development of Crohn's disease ( CD). Several studies have shown that the T300A variant does not alter bulk autophagy suggesting that a non-autophagic function of T300A may underlie its association with CD. Previous wor k in our lab has shown that th e ATG16L1 T300A variant is associated with longer overall s urvival and reduced metastasis in CRC patients. This study set out to understand the role of ATG16L1 in tumor d evelopment and metastasis. Using homologous recombination, our lab generated human CRC cel l lines that either lack ATG16L1 (ATG16L1-/-) or have the CD-associated T300A mutation (ATG16L1 performed xenograft experiments in RAG1-/- mice with ATG16L1+/+ cells injected in one flank and either ATG16L1-/- or ATG16L1 T300A cells injected into the other flank. On the d ay of necropsy, Brdu was administered intraperitoneally 4 hours prior to sacrif ice. Within two weeks post xenograft, there were significant size differences between the ATG16L1+/+ tumors and either the ATG16L1-/- or ATG16L1T300A tumors. Immunofluoresc ent staining of Brdu reveale significantly reduced uptake in both ATG16L1-/- and ATG16L1 T300A tumors compared to ATG16L1+/+. Further studies in cell culture determined this defect in Brdu uptake was attributed to slower cell cycling rather than cellular senescence. We also performed an in vitro scratch wound assay t o determine the migration kinetics for our three cell types. We found no difference in migration k inetics between the ATG16L1+/+ and the ATG16L1 T300A variant. We did see a significant reduction i n migration in the ATG16L1-/- cells. This indicates that the reduction in CRC metastasis associated with the ATG16L1 T300A variant is not due to a cell intrinsi c defect in migration. In conclusion, our results reveal that the ATG16L1 T300A varian t impairs tumor development in vivo. This was ev idenced by the significant redu ction in tumor size compared to ATG16L1+/+ tumor. These cells exhibit decreased proliferation as shown by the decreased uptake of Brdu and this was attributed to the cells having a slower cell cycle compared to ATG16L1+/+ cells. We also revealed that the association of the AGT16L1 T300A vari ant and reduced metastasis in CRC patients is not due to a lac k of migration kinetics in thes e cells.

In contrast, in the absence of l igands, DR initiates a signal for cell death/apoptosis. Thus, alterati on of the DR signaling pathway may play a role in tumorigenesis. In this study, we focus on the function of UNC5A, a DR, and its se creted ligand Netrin-1 (NTN1) in breast cancer and metastasis. estrogen (E2) and its recep tor (estrogen receptor-alpha; ERa) are major signaling players in ERa- positive breast cancers, we perf ormed all the studies in ERa-positive breast cancer cells. We observed that UNC5A and NTN1 are estrogen-inducible genes depending on cell types. In addition, RNA-se q analyses of vector control an d UNC5A- knockdown cells treated with or without E2 revealed ~10-fold increase in several E2-reg ulated genes in UNC5A- knockdown up-regulation of \u00bfNp63 , a TP53 family transcription factor that promotes breast epithelia l stem cell maintenance and basal-like breast cancer. Consistent with the known role of TP63 in cance r stem cells, UNC5A -knockdown cells displayed cancer stem ce ll phenotype as evident from ~3-f old increase in the number of CD44+/CD24+ and CD44+/EpCAM+ subpopulation compared with control cells. Furthermore, in vivo studies in mice determin ed that implantation of UNC5A -knockdown cells can form tumors in the mammary fat pad and are able to colonize multiple organs su ch as lungs, ovaries and adrenal glands. Thus, knockdown of UNC5A resulted in deregulated expression of E2-regulated genes, E2- independent and anti-estrogen-re sistant growth in vitro, and E2 -indpendent tumor formation in xenograft models. Overall, our results suggest that E2 induces UNC5A expression as a negative regulatory loop to restrict or f ine tune ERa:E2 signaling and m aintain luminal phenotype. Loss or mutation of UNC5A, as frequently observed in cancer, could lead to unrestricted E2:ERa signaling and anti-estrogen resistant grow th while simultaneously enablin g ERa-positive luminal breast cancer cells to acquire basal-like and c ancer stem cell-like features.

We propose that targeting the 60 kDa Heat Shock Prote in chaperonin system (HSP60/10) is a chemotherapeutic strategy towards treati ng colorectal cancers. In colorectal and other cancers (e. g. cervical, ovarian, breast, a nd prostate), the abnormally propagating cells have hijacked HSP60/10 regulation to help cir cumvent apoptosis. Studies show that HSP60/10 functions are associated with apoptotic, pro -survival, and role HSP60/10 in oncogenesi s is not fully understood, cytosolic accumulation of HSP60 in tumor environments with or w ithout mitochondrial release is likely contributing towards tumor progression. The l atter scenario results in na\u00efve HSP60, still bearing its N-terminal mitochondrial import sequen ce, which is reported to than mitochondrial HSP60. Na\u00efve HSP60 forms double- ring tetradecameric complexes instead of single rings. We have been developing inhi bitors against both na\u00efve and mitochondrial HSP60 to elucidate possible biochemical/funct ional differences between these forms and their respective role(s) in pathogenesis. High- throughput screening of ~700,000 compounds led to the identification of several hundred potent chaperonin inhibitors, which block the refolding pathway of HSP60/10. Many of these initial hits and first generation analogs inhibit the growth of colon cancer cell line s (HCT-116, HT-29 and DLD-1). We are currently optimizing these HSP60/10 inhibitors f or in vivo chemotherapeutic efficacy testing.

Duri ng the radiosensitization of tumor cells, ionizing radiation induces DNA double strand breaks. Failure o f DNA repair and damage respons es alter hematopoiesis and lead to the development of cancer prone genetic diseases. Within the bone marrow niche, normal hematopoietic stem cells remain within a relatively quiescent state, and megakaryo cytes promote their proliferation and differentiation following injurious insult. Cells of the devel oping megakaryocyte (MK) lineage must remain viable, progress through the cell cycle, and undergo extensive cellular remodeling to m aintain mesenchymal stromal and endothelial cells of the bone marrow vasculature. We evaluated bone marrow and MK responses to radiation induced injury in young C57BL/6 mice in a kinetic model for H2AX induction. In the non- irradiated mice, 5.82% of DRAQ5 live cells were observed to be H2AX positive. Following 650cGy TBI, phoshorylated H2AX(pS139) recruits DNA repair proteins and cell cycle checkpoint factors to sites of DNA damage. A significant increase in H2AX expression was observed within 30 minutes (14.52%, P<0.00 01), peaking at one hour (17.5%, P<0. 0001) and returning to normal v alue by hours. CD41+ c-Kit+ MK progenitor cells significantly follo wing radiation (72.53%, P<0.0001 ) and declined to similar levels a s that of the non-irradiated co ntrol mice within 24 hours. During apoptosis, the nuclear chromatin-associated enz yme, Poly ADP-Ribose Polymerase , is cleaved by caspase-3, arresting its activity and ability to repair DNA damage. Median values of fl uorescent intensity for cleaved PARP were significantly increased MK progenitors at 1h post irradiation (p<0.0012 ) and peaked at 24h post irradiation (p<0.0001) when compared to non-irradia ted controls. Megakaryocyte progenitors grown in culture for 5 days demonstrated a greater than 4-fold increase in apoptotic cells expressing H2AX from isolated spleens 1h following irradiation compared to cont rol cultures. Microscopic analysis of cultured cells demonstrated features of early stage apoptosis, shrunken cells with condensed cytoplasm containing fragmented and pyknotic nuclei. In cultured megakaryocyte prog enitors from spleens isolated at 8 and 48h post irradiation, shared features of apoptosis and necrosis wer e observed with cellular membrane blebbing, chromatin and cytoplasm condensation, and cell shrinkage. This study represents the first in kind of H2AX DNA damage and apoptosis in meg akaryocyte lineage cells of the bone marrow niche and may lend to translational applications in the evaluation of drugs as potent ial radiosensitizers. Basic Science Post-Doctoral/Medical FellowPOSTER #74 ACETYLATION REGULATES THE DNA BIN DING PROPERTIES PROTEIN A (RPA) Sneha Surendran1, Onyekachi snehsure@iupui.edu Genome maintenance is critical for cellular survival and growth . Replication Protein A (RPA), a single-strand DNA (ssDNA) binding protein, is vital fo r various aspects of genome maintenance such as replication, recombination, repair and chec kpoint activation. RPA binding to ssDNA protects it from degradation by cellular nucle ases, prevents secondary structure formation and from illegitimate recombination. Within the cell, RPA is subject to many post-translational modifications including phosphorylation , SUMOylation and ribosylation. These modifications regulate the activity of RPA by altering its interactions with DNA and other binding partners. In addition to other forms of m odification, acetylation of specific lysine residues has also been identified by mass spect rometry in a global acetylome study. In our current study, we evaluated the effect of lysine acetylation on different enzymatic properties of human recombinant RPA such as ssDNA binding affinity, DNA strand annealing and melting efficiencies. For the biochemical studies, RPA was in vitro modified by the catalytic domain of the acetyltransferase, p300. To study the effect of acetylation on its ssDNA binding function, we m a d e u s e o f e l e c t r o - m o b i l i t y g e l s h i f t a s s a y ( E M S A ) a n d b i o - l a y er interferometry (BLI) technology. Using various length oligonucleotides, we tested th e binding property of unmodified and acetylated RPA. Our results showed that acetylat ion of RPA increased its binding affinity compared to unmodified RPA. Interestingly, the acetylated form of RPA was also able to bind more stably to oligonucleotides of lengths sh orter than what was previously reported for optimal binding efficiency. Additionall y, acetylated RPA showed more stable binding in the presence of competitor ssDNA compare d to the unmodified form. All our results indicate that the acetylation of RPA imp roves its ssDNA binding function. Using mass spectrometry analysis we have correlated t he in vitro lysine sites on RPA that were modified to those reported in cells in the acetyl ome study. The acetylation- based alteration in its DNA binding properties would have signi ficant implications in maintenance of genome fidelity, since improved DNA binding func tion of RPA will presumably better pr otect the genome from b oth endogenous and e xogenous stresses.

While this effect appeared to be mediated indirectly through ch anges in the bone microenvironment, vitamin D and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) may also exert direc t actions on cancer growth in bone. The current study therefore aimed to define whether the VDR has a role in cancer growth . We found that knock-down of VDR expression in human breast canc er cells reduced cancer cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in-vitro, bothin the presence and absence of its 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Implantation of these VDR knockdown ce lls into nude mice resulted in reduced tumour growth in both bone and soft tissues, suggesting that the VDR affects cancer cell growth independent of the bone mic roenvironment. Overexpression of a mutant VDR deficient in the nuclear localization signal (mVDR ) in VDR Knockdowncells restor ed cell growth to the same level as seen in controls. This was as sociated with cytoplasmic accum ulation of mVDR. We conclude that the cytoplasmic VDR promotes breast cancer gro wth both in vitro and in vivo . These effects strongly contrast t he well-established anti-proliferative and pro-apopt otic actions of the VDR-Vitamin D ligand complex. This discovery adds to our under standing of VDR signalling in breast cancer and may help to resolve discrepancies regarding t he association between vitamin D status and breast cancer prognosis .

The Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) tumor suppressor is lost by hypermethylation or mutation in up to 70% of sporadic breast cancers; however, th e downstream effects of APC loss have not been well explored in breast cancer. Heterozygous Apc mutation using the ApcMin/+ mouse model enhanced tumorigenesis in the mouse mammary tumor virus - Polyoma Middle T transgenic model (MMTV-PyMT). Cells isolated from MMTV-PyMT; ApcMin/+ mice are resistant to cisplatin and doxorubicin, express higher levels of multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1), and have a greater population of tumor initiating cells (TICs) compared to controls. Here we demonstrate that APC loss-of-function cells have increased activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STA T3) and the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1. STAT3 over- expression is common in breast cancer, leads to poor prognosis, and up-regulates MDR1 expression leading to chemotherapeutic resistance. To explore the function al role of STAT3 in mediating therapeutic resistance in APC loss-of-function models, we examined the impact of STAT3 inhibition on MDR1 and the TIC population to cause therapeuti c resistance in the MMTV-PyMT;ApcMin/+ vs MMTV-PyMT; Apc+/+ murine breast cancer cells. We have made the novel observation that chemotherapy treatment has a time- dependent effect on the activation of ST AT3 and expression of Mcl-1 specific to Apc-mutant cells. Finally, we have assessed the use of STAT3 inhibitors in combin ation with standard chemot herapy to alleviate APC- mediated resistance. Combined these data suggest that loss of APC activates STAT3-driven pathways resulting in the development of chemotherapeutic Science Post-Doctoral/Medical FellowPOSTER #77 MECHANISMS ASSOCIATED WITH STEMIC Surgery, Indianapolis, IN Email: rewang@iupui.edu Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies. With its progress, breast cancer causes systemic effects such as functional limitation, sarcopenia, and cachexia. These effects are manifested as muscle weakness, body pain or depletion of skelet al muscle without apparent loss of body weight. Although onset of cachexia in breast cancer is not as rapid and severe as in lung and pancreatic cancer, over a quarter of breast cancer patients exp erience a precachexia to cachexia syndrome. However, mechanistic studies on systemic effects of b reast cancer are limited. In this project, we used myoblast cell line C2C12 and rat embryonic cardiomyocyte cell line for in vitro assays and MMTV-Her2/Neu and MMTV-PyMT mammary tumor mode ls for in vivo assays to illuminate key players linked to systemic effects, to identify functional biomarkers, and to develop a rational therapy for systemic co mplications of breast cancer. I n in vitro studies, we found treatments with conditioned media from a number of mammary tumor cell lines, including PO1058 (poorly invasive tumor cells from PyMT-W apCre-mGFP+ mice in C57BL6 back ground), PO1059 (highly invasive cells from PyMT-WapCre-m GFP+ mice), and MMT8 (tumor ce lls from MMTV-Neu mice in FVB/N background) resulted in a s ignificant decrease of miR486 in C2C12 cells but not in H9C2 cells. miR486 a muscle-enriched microRNA, which controls dif ferentiation of myoblasts and its deregulation is linked to musculoskeletal defects in muscular dystrophy patients. Interestingly, we also found lower circulating miR- 486 in the plasma of patients with pancreatic and bladder but not lung cancer. These data are consistent with our previous report of lower circulating miR486 in plasma of breast cancer patients with metastasis compared with healthy women. In in vivo study, we observed deteriorating physi cal and functional conditions in PyMT + mice with the progression of mammary tumor. Compared to wildtype mice, PyMT+ mice with mammary tumors showed decreased fat mass and decreased grip strength, both markers of advancing cachexia. In our preliminary drug intervention st udy, Diaminomethylparthenolide (DMAPT), a NF-\u00bfB inhibitor, partially reduced mammary tumor development in tumor numbers an d sizes in PyMT + mice and several of the systemic effects of cancer. To date, we have not found an effect of mammary tumor on cardiac functions of 12-week old PyMT+ mice. Continuous monitoring of these mice with the progression of their tumors will reveal more detailed mechanistic changes associated with systemic effects of breast cancer. In summary, mammary tumor resulted in changes in body composition and the decrease of grip strength of PyMT+ mice, which may be associated with altered NF-\u00bfB pathway. Additionally, circulating miR-486 may serve as a useful clinical indicator of progression and systemic effects of certain cancers.

Constitutive NF-\u00bfB is often found in some types of cancers, contributing to onco genesis and tumor progression. Therefore, knowing how NF-\u00bfB is regulated is important for its therapeutic control. Post-translational modification of the p65 subunit of NF- \u00bfB is a well-known approach for its regulation. Here, we reporte d that, in response to interleukin 1b (IL-1\u00df), the p65 subunit of S316A (serine 3 16-alanine) mutant exhibited s ignificantly reduced ability to activate NF-\u00bfB and decreased cell growth as compared to wtp65 (wild type p65 ). Moreover, conditioned media from cells expressing the S316A-p65 mutant had a considerably lower ability to induce NF-\u00bfB than that of wtp65. Our data suggested that phosphor ylation of p65 on S316 controls the activity and function of NF- \u00bfB. Importantly, we found that phosphor ylation at novel S316 site, and other two known phosphorylation sites\u2014S529 and S536\u2014either individually or cooperatively, regulated distinct groups of NF- \u00bfB-dependent genes, suggesting the unique role of each individual phosphoryl ation site on NF- \u00bfB-dependent gene regulation. Our novel findings provide an important piece of ev idence regarding differential regulation of NF-\u00bfB-dependent genes through phosphorylation of different p65 serine residues, thus shedding light on novel mechanisms for the pathway -specific control of NF-\u00bfB. Thi s knowledge is key to develop strategies for prevention and treatment of constit utive NF-\u00bfB-driven inflammatory diseases and cancers.

Distinct changes are observed in peritoneal tissue associated with aging that correlate with the incidence of ovarian cancer (OvCa). The occurrence o f OvCa is strongly correlated w ith the age of patient, with >85% of cases occurring in women over the age of 45, and >50% occurring betwe en the ages of 45-75. Data suggests that distinctive changes occur to t he mesothelial cells and the asso ciated extra-cellular matrix (ECM) with We hypothesize that microscopic vari ation in the biomechanical properties of peritoneal tissues affect the metastatic success of ovarian c ancer. To test this hypothesis, we propose instrumentatio n for correlating the microscopic ECM structure with e lastic properties (Young's modu lus) of the peritoneum tissue by performing AFM force-distance measurements simultaneously with SHG imaging . To our knowledge, no has measured how the ECM structure correlates to tissue stiffness. The development of technology to assess and correlate the ECM molecular structure with tissue mechanical properties w ill transform understanding of OvCa metastasis. We have obtained a value for the Young's modulus fr om very soft samples (E 200 KPa) like PDMS and tissue in air. The thickness of tissue requires optic al access from the top, the same side as the AFM. We are currently working to address challenges associated with experiments in solution. Ultimately, we will combine SHG - Force meas urements to assess age-related changes in the peritoneal tissue. Differences have been observed in the SHG imaging of peritoneal tissue. This marker will provide evidence of our ability to correlate forc e measurements with structural information observed in the SHG measurements.

Since ovarian cancer has a distantly spread survival rate of only 27%, it is critical to understand how secondary metastases arise and how to develop be tter treatments. The detachment of single cells or multicellular aggr egates (MCAs) and implantatio n into the mesothelium of the organs initiate ovarian cancer cell metastasis. The factors and molecu lar events that regulate the attachment of MCAs to the surface of the peritoneal cavity are generally u nknown. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) function by helping to break down the extracellular matr ix in typical cell function. MT1- MMP is a transmembrane collagenase that is known to be highly e xpressed in ovarian cancer tumors. MT1-MMP has been shown to aid in ovarian cancer cell metastasis by promoting cellular detachment and MCA formation. In this study, we investigated th e potential role of MT1-MMP in promoting ovarian cancer cell migration. We generated mutant ovarian cancer cell lines expressing wild-type MT1-MMP, the catalytically inactive MT1-MMP-E240A mutant. Wound healing assa y was performed to evaluate cell migration in vitro . Phospho-mimetic mutants of Thr567 exhibit enhanced cell migra tion, suggests that MT1-MMP phosphorylation plays a role in ovarian c ancer cell migration, which facilitates ovarian cancer metastasis.

Manjushree Anjanappa1 1 Surgery, Indiana University School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN Email: manjanap@iupui.edu Success of precision medicine depends on definitive identificat ion of cancer-specific a lterations in signaling pathways. However, identifying cancer-specific signaling networ ks is challenging because of lack of proper control tissue for differential gene expression analyses. Most studies in breast cancer utilize tumor-adjacent normal tissue or reduction mammoplasty samples as \"normal\" cont rols. We recently reported that breast epithelial cells from healthy do nors as well as tumor-adjacent normal are in different differentiation states compared with tumor cells and the differences in differentiatio n status alone could account for major transcriptome variations between normal and tumor. To overcome these limitations, we propagated breast epithelial cells from three hea lthy donors (healthy-normal), tw o high-risk patients, two tumor-adjacent normal (HR/AD-normal) and five tumor sam ples of different molecular su btypes. Phenotypically defined (CD49f+/EpCAM+) luminal progenito r cells were sorted from these cultures and subjected to RNA-seq analyses. Pathway analysis reveal ed activation of cell-intrinsi c pro-inflammatory si gnaling in HR/AD-normal cells compared with healthy-norma l cells. This signaling networ k was further amplified in tumor cells. The pro-inflammatory chemokine CCL2, which is overexpressed in high ly aggressive breast cancer, and the cytokine TNFRSF11B were elevated in HR/AD-normal luminal progenitor cells. Despite using phenotypically defined cells in the transcriptome analyses, can cer-specific signaling network identification was directly influenced by the type of controls used; healthy-n ormal or HR/AD-normal. While cancer- enriched PI3K and NF- B activation was observed when compared to any kind of control, SRC kinase activation was noted only when c ells from healthy-normal were u sed as a control. In general, the number of tumor signaling networks identified using healthy-normal as a control was higher than when compared with HR/AD-normal as a control. These results suggest that considera ble attention should be placed on the type of tissues used as control for definitive identification of cancer -specific signaling networks and therapies to target such pathways. Additionally, these data show that non-ca ncer tissues of breast cancer patients acquire a cell intrinsic pro-inflammatory p henotype, which may be prerequ isite for cancer development and potentially an early-detection tool.

Evidence suggests tha t chemotherapeutic regimens, such as Folfiri, a combination of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and CPT-11, may also be responsible for these derangements. Despite this, it is unclear whether the same molecular mechanis ms contribute to the development of cachexia as occurring in the presence of e ither chemotherapy or cancer. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the cachexi a signature in different conditions associated with severe muscle w asting, namely Folfiri- and Colo n-26 (C26)- associated cachexia. Administration of Folfiri for up to 5 weeks to normal mice caus ed marked decreases in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle mass, coherent w ith reduced muscle strength. Mo reover, TEM analysis unveiled a marked depletion in muscle mitochondrial content and alterations of th e sarcomeric structure consistent with loss of muscle structural proteins in th e mice receiving chemotherapy. Similarly, growth of the C26 tumor caused a progressive depletion of muscle and fat tissue, associated with general inflammation a nd muscle weakness. By taking advantage of a LC/MS quantitative approach we identified 389 proteins significantly modulated in the quadriceps muscle of Folfiri-treated CD2F1 mice, C26 hosts = change = +1.5). Both experimental conditio ns reveal modulation of calcium-related proteins, metabolic enzymes, structural proteins, markers of st ress response and folding, mediators of proteasomal degradation and proteins associated with cellular t ransport. However, strong up-regulation of pro- inflammatory acute-phase proteins and a more coordinated modulation of mitochondrial and lipidic metabolisms seem to play a prominent role in the muscle of C26 tumor hosts, differently from the Folfiri treatment. In the overall, our results suggest that cancer and chemotherap y contribute to muscle loss by activating several common signaling pathways. Regardless, peculiar differe nces resulting from the effects due to either cancer or chemotherapy are also shown. In an attempt to transla te our findings into the clinical setting, our data support the undertaking of co mbination strategies that aim to both counteract tumor growth and reduce chemotherapy side effects.

High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most prevalent sub-type of ovarian cancer, which accounts for 70-80% of ovarian cancer deaths. Despite significant advances in the understandin g of HGSOC at the molecular level, the current ovarian cancer treatments fail due to presence of highly metastatic and drug resistant tumors. Thus, it is critical to understand the molecular mechan isms that regulate HGSOC tumorigenesis. Ubiquitin its aber rant expression and methylatio n has been implicated with several cancers. UCHL1 activity is repor ted be related to cell survival and metastasis under hypoxia as it is a HIF1a . Recent studies in ovarian ca ncer have reported UCHL1 promoter methylation in low-grade ovarian cancer. However, its expression and function remains unknown in HGSOC. In the present study, we characterized the expression and role of UCHL1 in HGSOC tumorigenesis and patient p rognosis. Employing three diff erent algorithms that integrate gene expression and survival data from different datasets of HG SOC patients, including TCGA data, we observed high UCHL1 levels were significantly associated wit h poor disease free survival (HR = 2.1 (1.26- 3.65), p = 0.004), overall survival (HR = 1.31 (1.11-1.55), p=0.002), progression free survival (HR = 1.28 (1.09-1.49), p=0.002) and stage III and sta ge IV survival (HR = 1.52 (1.04 - 2.21), p = 0.03) of HGSOC patients. UCHL1 expression levels (RN A and protein) were significantly high in a panel of HGSOC cell lines (Kuramochi, OVCAR4, l ess proliferative compared to u n-silenced controls. UCHL1 silencing also exhibited signifi cantly reduced cell migration a nd clonogenicity. In addition, treatment with UCHL1 inhibitor (LDN-57444) resulted in reduced overall ce ll proliferation in OVCAR4 cells (p<0.005; n=2). These results were in line with clinical outcom e in HGSOC patients. Together, these results suggest that UCHL1 promotes HGSOC tumorigenesis possibl y in an indirect manner, by up regulating or promoting pro-onc ogenic factors in HGSOC. Therefo re, targeting UCHL1 in HGSOC could be a useful anti-cancerous approach.

Prevention strategies are lik ely to have the greatest effect when initiated early in life and sustained. Our study focuses on the early-lif e risk factor of early age at menarche, which has been widely shown to be associat ed with an increase in a woman' s risk for developing breast cancer. Each 1-year decrease in age at menarche increases breast cancer risk by 5%, and an age at menarche of less than 12 shows a relative risk (RR) of 1.21 according to the Gail model. The mechanisms behind the relationship between early age at menarche and increased risk of breast canc er are not well understood. We hypothesize that early age at menarche resul ts in permanent molecular alter ations in the breast tissue and that those abnormalities may contribute to the tissue's susceptibility to carcinogens and breast cancer development. To test our hypothesis we used the resources available at the Susan G. Komen Tissue Bank at the IU Simon Cancer Center (KTB). From the KTB, young women with early menar che (age = 10 years) and with late menarche (age = 15 years) were selected and matched for age (ra nging from 18-30), race, BMI, and menstrual status. Breast tissue biopsies from these women were microdisse cted using a laser microdissection microscope (Leica LMD 6500) in order to isolate the breast epithelium, her e defined as terminal ductal lobular units (TDLU). The TDLU are the basic functional and histopathological units of the breast that give rise to most breast cancers. RNA was isolated from the microdissected TDLU a nd next generation RNA-sequencing was used to generate a transcriptome profile for each sample. The s tromal compartment of each of the samples was also evaluated using immunostaining, as the breast epithelium a nd stroma are in a state of continuous interaction. Together, this information will give us the opport unity to better understand early age at menarche as a breast cancer risk and advanc e research for w omen's health .

Gavande1 and John J. Turchi1,2 1Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202 2NERx BioSciences Inc. Indianapolis, IN 46202 Chemotherapeutics cisplatin and carboplatin react with DNA to f orm platinum (Pt)-DNA adducts that block DNA replication, transcr iption and cell division, culminating in cell death through apoptosis. Repair of Pt-DNA adducts via nuc leotide excision repair (NER) or homologous recombination repair (HRR) can substantially reduce the effectiveness of the Pt ther apy and is a major contributor to cellular resistance. Inhibition of these repair pathways holds the potential to sensitize cancer cells to Pt treatment and increase clinical efficacy. We have target ed Replication Protein A (RPA) which plays essential roles in both NER and HRR as well as DNA replic ation and DNA damage checkpoint activation. Each of these func tions requires RPA binding to si ngle-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and we have developed small molecule inhibitors that disrupt this prot ein-DNA interaction. Our lead compound, TDRL-551, displays synergy with Pt in tissue culture models of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and in vivo efficacy as a single agent and in combination with platinum in a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) xenograft model. We have expanded our synt hetic scheme and defined structure-activity relationships (SARs) to towards optimization of the TDRL-551 core structure as an anticancer therapeutic for the tr eatment of lung and ovarian ca ncer. Basic Science Research TechnicianPOSTER #86 TARGETING RPA WITH ISOBORNYL SMALL MOLECULES OF MCI VIA THE ZIN C- FINGER MOTIF Tyler Vernon1 1 Medicine, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN Email: tyvernon@iupui.edu Replication protein A ( RPA) is a heterotrimeric that contains the subunits p70, p32, and p14 (kDa) and is essential in the processes of DNA replication, recombination , and repair. RPA's role in these pathways is mediated by binding to damaged DNA. The binding enables the rec ruitment of other proteins and proper stabilization of the damaged single-stranded DNA regions. Targe ting RPA with inhibitors of DNA repair poses the possibility of sensitiz ing current DNA damaging chemotherapeutic regimens and therefore reducing the amount of harmful chemotherapy that would have to be admini stered to a patient. Previously, our lab identified and analyzed a class of irreversible small molecule inhibitors (SMI); the isobornyl haloesters that interact with full-length RPA and demonstrate inhibitory effect s with its binding acti vity to single-stranded D N A . I t w a s a l s o s h o w n t h a t t h e i sobornyl haloester derivatives , MCI13E and MCI13F, do significant inhibition of the ce ntral OB-folds of RPA 70, the R PA-AB-box. Therefore, the purpose of the research within is to further cha racterize the specificity of these compounds by identifying the exact location of where the isobornyl haloesters are inhibiting the full-lengt h RPA. A zinc-finger motif within the C domain of RPA that is responsible for proper destabilization during th e transition from the -8nt to the -30nt binding mode has been mutated; four cysteine residues have been mutated to four alanine residues in the preparation of full-length RPA. The data demonstrates that this class of S MI's specifically targets the zinc-finger motif of RPA by creating cysteine-MC I13E/F covalent adducts. Basic Science Research TechnicianPOSTER #87 THE IMPACT OF XPC ON LUNG DISEASE IN A MOUSE MODEL OF CHRONIC CIGARETTE SMOKE Huaxin Zhou1, Jessica Wicker2, George Sandusky3,4, Catherine Sears4,5 1 Indiana University School Of Medicine, Department Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 2 Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis, IN 3 Department Of Pathology And Laboratory Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 4 Indiana University School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 5 Department Of Medi cine, Indianapolis, IN Email: huaxzhou@iu.edu Background : Lung cancers in smokers exhibit extreme ge notypic diversity, containing thousands of mutations, which may be due to defects in DNA repair. Exposures to cigarette smoke (CS) cause DNA damage which includes bulky DNA lesions and oxidative damage to DNA bases. The DNA repair protein Xeroderma Pigmentosum Group C (XPC) plays a key role the repair of both bulky and oxidative DNA damage. We hypothesized that XP C protects against the development of early malignant changes induced by CS and therefore loss of XPC function increases the susceptibility to CS-induced lung injury. Methods: XPC -/- and WT mice (B6;129 background) were exposed to 3, 6 or 9 months of ambient air control (AC) or chronic CS (5 hours/day, 5 days/week; TE-10 apparatus). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of formalin fixed lung tissue was evaluated by a lung pathologist. Pulmonary function testing was performed on anesthetized mice using the flexiVent system (Scireq). Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis for oxid ative DNA lesions was performed with 8-oxoG antibody (Abcam). Quantitative data were comp ared with Student's t-te st or 2-way ANOVA. Results: Mice exposed to chronic CS showed lung mor phologic and significant functional changes in lung compliance consistent with mild emphysema that were CS and genotype specific. Mice exposed to chronic CS showed evidence of CS-ind uced metaplastic changes in airway epithelial cells, with more marked dysplasia noted in XPC -/- mice (when qualitativ ely scored, in a blinded fashion). Dysplastic changes in XPC-deficient l ungs included increased nuclear size, decreased cytoplasm-to-nuclear volume and nuclear atypia. Measures of auto phagy, including LC3B and p62, were altered by Western Blot analysis in lung homogenates by CS exposure and XPC expression. Conclusions: XPC deficiency may accelerate development of CS-induced lung pre-cancerous lesions and emphysema and may play a role in regulation of autophagy in the lung. Measures to regain XPC function may mitigate the risk of CS-induced lung cancer.

Xeroderma Pigmentosum group C (XPC) is a key protein in the nucleotide exci sion repair (NER) pathway, which is essential for removing bulky DNA lesions, including those produced by CS. We hypothesized that a deficiency in XPC would accelerate CS-induced lung changes of emphysem a through an increase in cellular apoptosis. For these experiments, XPC knock-out (KO) and wild-type (W T) mice were exposed to 9 months of CS or air control (AC). Lung homogenates were evaluated for apoptosis by caspase-3 activity. Frozen and fixed, paraffin embedded sections of lung tissue were evaluated for apoptosis by terminal respectively. CS ex posure caused emphysematous changes in both WT and KO mice, most apparent in KO mice. An increase in caspase-3 activity was noted in CS-exposed XPC KO mice. Active caspase-3 staining was observed in all groups without a clear genotypic effect. Low levels of TUNEL staining were observed in all groups, with positive and negative control samples staining appropriately. However, we were unable to conclude the impact of CS or genotype on TUNEL staining due to low number of samples. We conclude that XPC deficiency leads to an increase in emphysema; it is not clear if this is due to apoptosis or an alternate mechanism. Further studies will focus on the mechanism of this observed action. Basic Science Undergraduate StudentPOSTER #89 INHIBITION OF Indianapolis, IN 2 Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN Email: poirierc@iu.edu Background and rationale. Cancer-related cachexia is a mult ifactorial syndrome defined by an ongoing loss of muscle and fat. It is common in patients with pancreatic cancer and is responsible for at least 20% of mortality. Activin signaling is known to promote cancer progression and exacerbate cachexia. In this study , we investigate how inhibition of activin signaling could limit cancer progression and protect against cachex ia in a mouse model for pancreatic cancer. Methods. Cancer was induced through orthotopic implan tation in mouse pancre as of 50,000 cells from the C57BL/6J-derived pancreatic cancer cell line KPC32043. For systemic we puri fied soluble activin IIB receptor (ActrIIB-Fc) from mammalian cells genetically engineered to secrete ActrIIB-Fc. Following KPC32043 implantation in 3-month old C57BL/6J males, systemic inhibition of signaling hieved through multiple intra-peritoneal inje ctions of ActrIIB-Fc. F o r s k e l e t a l m u s c l e i n h i b i t i o n o f a c t i v i n s i g n a l i n g , w e u s e d m a l e m i c e f r o m a C 5 7 B L / 6 J c o n g e n i c strain which carry a transgene expr essing a dominant negative acti vin IIB receptor under the control of a myosin light chain promoter, ML C::dnActrIIB. In transgenic mice, there is a strong expression of dominant negative activin IIB receptor in skeletal muscle allowing tiss ue specific inhibition of activin signaling. Implantation of KPC32043 was perfor med in 3-month and 7-month old transgenic and non-transgenic littermates.In order to monitor the development of cachexia, we recorded for each mouse body weight (daily), whole body composition (weekly), and grip strength (weekly).Results and conclusion. We found that systemic inhibition of activin signaling is associated with reduction of tumor mass and limited cachexia. We also found that skeletal muscle inhibition of activin signaling in older mice limits cachexia in absence of tumor mass reduction. However, in younger mice, skeletal muscle inhibition of activi n signaling did not have any effect on cachexia. In conclusion, we propose that systemic inhibiti on of activin signaling limits pancreatic cancer growth invivo ; in addition, skeletal muscle inhibition of activin signaling protects against cachexia in age-dependent manner.

The Daughters A nd MothErS (DAMES) Against Brea st Cancer trial found significant effects of two 12-m onth mailed weight loss interven tions on exercise and weight-related outcomes for overweight breast cancer survivors and their overw eight adult daughters relative to a control condition. Based on Social Cognitive Theory, the interv entions targeted participants' self- efficacy for engaging in health behaviors. This study aimed to examine whether self-efficacy for dietary and exercise behaviors at the intervention mid-point (6 months post-baseline) predicted these behaviors post-intervention (12 months post-baseline). Methods : Early-stage breast cancer su rvivors and their adult daughters ( n=68 dyads, 74% Caucasian, mean age=61 years for mothers a nd 33 years for daughters) were recruited from medical centers and the community. Participants com pleted measures of diet quality , caloric intake, exercise, and self- efficacy for diet and exercise a t baseline, 6- and 12-months. Data from dyads enrolled in the intervention groups ( n=50 dyads) were examined. Autore gressive panel models tested relationships between self-effi cacy and behavior change (contro lling for baseline behavior). Results: All models fit the data well ( \u00bf2 ps>0.05, RMSEA<0.06). Among daughters, higher levels of self-efficacy for diet at 6 mont hs were associated with lower c aloric intake at 12 months. In addition, greater self-efficacy for diet at 6 months was associated with improved diet quality at 12 months, but this relationship fell short of significance ( p=0.06). Self-efficacy for diet did not predict mothers' dietary behaviors, and self-effi cacy for exercise at 6 months d id not predict mothers' or daughters' minutes of exercise at 12 months.Conclusions/Implications: Findings suggest that improving se lf-efficacy for engaging in dietary behaviors via mailed interventions may lead to dietary change a mong daughters of breast cancer survivors.

Behavioral Graduate StudentPOSTER #91 AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN' S PERSPECTIVES ON DO NATING HEALTHY BREAS T TISSUE FOR RESEARCH: IMPLICATIONS FOR RECRUITMENT Katherine E Ridley-Merriweather1, Katharine J Head2 1 Komen Tissue Bank, Indianapolis, IN 2 Graduate Communications Studies, Indianapolis, IN Email: keridley@iupui.edu African-American women die of breast cancer at a higher rate th an any other race or ethnicity. The Komen Tissue Bank (KTB) is a clinical trial that represents a critica l tool in efforts to find new approaches for the treatment and prevention of breas t cancer; however, African-Ame ricans display reticence toward participation not only in the KTB but in clinical trials and medical research in general. Through the lens of the Integrated Behavioral Model, this study rec ruited Black women to share the ir perspectives on donating breast tissue for research purposes. Seventy-one (n=71) eligible self-identifie d African-American women who were previous tissue donors to the Komen Tissue Bank responded to an email qu estionnaire with open-ended questions that addressed such issues as their perspectives on donating breast tissue, social support for their decision to donate, and how their race may have affected their decision to donate. Findings revealed that participan ts had positive instrumental a ttitudes toward donating, including a desire to help with breast cancer research, to help Black women specifica lly, and to honor or support someone who was known to the participant and who had breast cancer. Participants discussed generally positive normative influences on their decision to donate, but also revealed that they felt they were creating norms themselves and leaving a \"legacy\" for others to follow their example. In considering how race pla yed into their decision to donate and their experience w ith donating, participants ackn owledged the negative history of African- Americans in medical research, but offered their perceptions re garding the importanc e of Black people involving themselves in medical research. In fact, participants discussed that health communication strategies to recruit black people into research should not shy away from the race issue, but instead embrace it as part of the message. In conclusion, this study revealed important persp ectives about how African-American women feel about participating in medi cal research generally and dona ting breast tissue specifically. The findings from this study are currently being used in practice to improve recruitment of black women to donate to the KTB. Additionally, the findings from this study have important implications for other health communication scholars who work in applied clinical settings and are interested in addressing racial disparities in medical research through more effective and targeted recruitment messag ing. Behavioral Graduate StudentPOSTER #92 HOW DID ADVANCED PANCREATIC CANCER PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS COMMUNICATE THEIR NEEDS IN THE UNSTRUCTURED MEDICAL ENCOUNTER Chia-Chun Tang1, Cleveland Shields2, Diane Von Ah1 1 Nursing, IUPUI, Indianapolis, IN 2 Purdue, West Lafayette, IN Email: cckimi72@gmail.com Background Although it is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in th e United States, little is known about how patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (APC) and their ca regivers communicate their needs with healthcare providers. APC patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers face unique communication challenge s related to handlin g high psychological distress and overwhelming information within a short period. Consequently, these communic ation difficulties may also affect their quality of life and decision making process. This pilot study seeks to explore how APC patients and their caregivers communica te their concerns about the disea se, patterns of communication, and psychological reacti ons with oncologists. Method De-identified transcripts of APC patients' audio-recorded offic e visits were selected from a large randomized controlled trial calle d the Values and Options in Ca ncer Care. Among the 37 qualified transcripts, we purposeful selected four transcriptions with di fferent levels of prognosis discussion as prognosis discussion may be a marker for patients' and caregive rs' emotional status. Selected transcripts were analyzed in terms of discussion topics, messag e quality, patients' emotional cues, and oncologists' responses to thes e emotional cues. Message qua lity was evaluated based on several patient-centered clinic ian verbal behaviors purposed by Drs. Epstein and Street. We used Medical Interview Aural Rating Scale to code patients' emotional cues a nd oncologists' corresponding responses. Emotional cues were coded according to psychological depth. Oncologists' responses was coded into five categories of c ue-responding behaviors (name, understand, respect, support, and block).ResultsTwelve participants contributed t o four transcripts. Each consultations contained three participants: oncologist, patient and caregiver who contributed to 2806.25, 7 31 and 463.5 words, respectively. Among the nine categories of consultation topics identified, physical sym ptoms and signs were the most frequent mentioned topic (n=22) followed by care procedure (n=5), drug (n=4) and lab results (n=4). Oncologists initiated more topics (n=35) patients ( n=8) and caregivers (n=4). Moreover, oncologist-initiated interrupti ons occurred in all consultation s with an average of 5.25 interruptions per consultation.Although neither patient nor oncologist discussed emotion related topics explicitly, patients and caregivers experien ced a variety of emotional fluc tuation. Overall, 87 patients' (n=54) and cues were identified. The majo rity of the cues were level one, implicit emotional cues (n=80). The most frequent oncologists' responding strategy was blocking, including switching focus (i.e., the oncologist switched away from the emotion, but within the context of the patients disclosure) and overt blocking (i.e., t he oncologist completely disrupted the conversation by moving away from a ll the content of and all the cues). Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze unstructur ed conversation to identify APC patients' concerns and how these c oncerns were addressed in off ice visits.Our findings provide valuable insight for identifying needs and enhancing end of life care and communication of this population. Behavioral Graduate StudentPOSTER #93 SYMPTOM IMPORTANCE IN METASTA TIC BREAST CANCER PATIENTS Danielle Tometich1, Catherine Mosher1, Kevin Rand1, Adam Hirsh1 1 Psychology, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, IN Email: dbtometi@iupui.edu Research on symptoms in cancer p atients has largely focused on symptom severity, frequency, and distress. Assessing patients' per ceptions of symptom importance\u2014how important it is for them to see improvement in a symptom\u2014would also inform patient-centered treatment approaches, but this has not been examined in patients with cancer. In order to addr ess this gap, this study aimed to identify physical and psychological symptoms considered most im portant to metastatic breast cancer patients, a population with high symptom burden. Subgroups of p atients were derived based on ratings of symptom importance. Ei ghty metastatic breast cancer patients were recruited from the Indiana University Simon Cancer Center to participate in this c ross-sectional telephone interview study. The interview included measures of demographics, quality of life, symptom severity, and the importance of seeing improvement i n specific symptoms post-trea tment. An exploratory cluster analysis was performed on patient-rated symptom importance for 10 symptoms (i.e., pain, fatigue, anxiety, sadness, numbness/tingling in hands/feet, swelling of arms or legs, nausea, hot flashes, sleep problems, and attention/thinking/memory problems) and revealed four clusters of patients based on these ratings: 1) all symptoms rated highly, 2) thinking, sleep, and fatigue rated highly, 3) pain and fatigue rated moderately, and 4) pain, fatigue, anxiety, sadnes s, sleep and thinking rated highly important. One-way ANOVAs indicate d that the clusters differed on years of education [ F(3, 76) = 4.58, p = .005, \u00bf2 = .15], quality of life [ F(3, 76) = 8.16, p < .001, \u00bf2 = .24], and usual symptom severity for anxiety [ F(3, 76) = 6.11, p = .001, \u00bf2 = .19], sadness [ F(3, 76) = 3.89, p = .012, \u00bf2 = .13], sleep problems [ F(3, 76) = 3.07, p = .033, \u00bf2 = .11], and thinking problems [ F(3, 76) = 10.83, p < .001, \u00bf2 = .30]. Findings suggest that subgroups of metastatic breast c ancer patients ha ve different symptom treatment priorities, which highlights the importance o f tailoring treatment to these priorities. Behavioral Graduate StudentPOSTER #94 DISTRESS AND AVOIDANT COPING IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS Andrea Cohee1, Shelley Johns2, Timothy Stump3, Patrick Monahan3, Victoria Champion1 1 Nursing, Indianapolis, IN 2 Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 3 Medicine, Department Of Bi ostatistics, Indianapolis, IN Email: aamaners@iu.edu Introduction : The majority of breast cancer survivors (BCS) demonstrate a g reat capacity to recover from the negative sequelae of cancer treatment; however, some report persistent and disruptive distress well into disease-free survivorship. More information is needed on the contributing factors to distress in this growing population, including the role of avoidant c oping in predicting distress. Methods: In a large cross-sectional study, breast cancer survivors (n = 1,127) who were 3 to 8 years post diagnosis completed a survey ass essing demographic characteristics, avoidant coping, distress (state anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms) and theoretical ly-related factors, including: fear of recurrence, fatigue, attention f unction, social support from a partner, social constraints from a partner, and body image. Multiple mediation analyses were conducted to deter mine if avoidant coping mediated the relationship between distress and all other factors. As all fac tors were highly correlated, multiple mediation analyses were chosen to account for each factor's unique contri bution to distress. Results: In all 18 mediation models, avo idant coping significantly (p < .001) mediated the relationship between each contributing factor ( fear of recurrence, fatigue, attention function, social support, social constraints, and body image) and each distress indicator (depre ssion, state anxiety, and impact of event). Effect sizes ranged k2 = 0.14 to k 2 = 0.22, all of which were classified as medium effect sizes. Conclusion/Implications: Interventions targeting avoidant coping may be effective in reducing distress in long-term breast cancer survivors. Behavioral Post-Doctoral/Medical FellowPOSTER #95 A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW ON THE USE AND ACCEPTANCE OF CANCER-SPECIFI C PATIENT CENTERED TECHNOLOGIES A MONG UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS Will Tarver1, David Haggstrom2 1 IU School Of Nursing, Indianapolis, IN 2 IU School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN Email: wltarver@iu.edu Introduction: In the US, more than 1.6 million new cases of cancer are estima ted to be diagnosed each year. However, the burden of cancer among the US populati on is not shared equally with racial and ethnic minorities and lower-income populations having a hig her cancer burden when compared to their counterparts. A wide r ange of technologies (e.g., Int ernet-based [eHealth] technologies and mobile [mHealth] applications) are available to patients that a re designed to improve their access to care and empower them to particip ate actively in their care pro viding a means to reduce health care disparities; yet, little is known of their use among underserve d populations. Objective: The purpose of this article is to systematically review the c urrent evidence on the use of cancer-specific patient-centered technologies among various und erserved populations. Methods: Computer-based searches were conducted in the following academi c databases: 1) PubMed [cancer subset]; 2) MEDLIN E, 3) PsycINFO; and 4) CINAHL. We included articles that appeared in peer reviewed journa ls, were published in the Engli sh language, and were conducted in the US. Each study was individually assessed for relevance wit h any disagreements being reconciled by consensus. We used a 3-step inclusion process in which we ex amined study titles, abstracts, and full-text articles for assessment of inclusion criteria. Results: This ongoing review includes 11 articles that use patient-centered technologies targeting African-American (n=6), Hispanic (n=3), and low-income (n=2) underserved populations. A majority of studies used mHealth technologies (n=9) while 2 stu dies used eHealth applications. Seven studies assessed text messaging and found that participan ts reported overall favorable responses to receiving health i nformation via text; however, ch allenges were experienced with respect to a lack of knowledge of how to text among some partic ipants. More complex mobile technologies (i.e., a risk assessment tool, and tablet-based in tervention) were also found to be easy and favorable to use, as well as new and innovative which peake d an interest with participants who desired to keep up with technology. These more complex technol ogies also resulted in more significant barriers. More speci fically, participants expresse d concerns regarding security and unfamiliarity with the technology. With respect to eHealth app lications, African-Americans were found to be more likely to use eHealth for information and heal th management. Separately, while Hispanics were receptive to eHealth, several usability issues were identified related to content comprehension, navigation issues , and cultural appropriateness. Conclusion: Despite the potential of patient -centered technologies to red uce disparities, their use among underserved populations has received little attention. P reliminary results of this review reveal that while underserved populations are receptive to these techn ologies, challenges still exist. We conclude by discussing an agenda for future research which shou ld continue to explore effective design strategies and culturally appropriate tailoring of these technologies to underserved populations. Behavioral Post-Doctoral/Medical FellowPOSTER #96 THE AMPATH-ONCOLOGY INSTITUTE: LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS OF HPV CERVICAL CANCER IN WOMEN WITH HIV/AIDS Darron Brown Susan Moorman, Aaro n Ermel 1 Indiana University School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 2 Alpert School Of Medicine, Brown University Email: darbrow@iu.edu Background. Cervical cancer is the most common malignancy in women living Kenya. While HIV infection accounts for much of the high incidenc e and mortality of cervical cancer in Kenyan women, other modifiable cofactors are likely to be important. The AMPATH-Oncology Institute (AOI) is a part of AMPATH, a multidisciplinary colla boration of North American universities, led by Indiana University, with Moi University and Moi Te aching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret, Kenya. One goal of the AOI is to study the influence of HIV infection on the natural history of cancers, including cervical cancer. Methods. The goals of this five-year project are to enhance the research workforce in Kenya and to study the natural history of HPV infections and cerv ical cancer in HIV-infect ed women. Two projects to be conducted are 1) defining modifiable factors predicting persistenc e of oncogenic HPV and cervical dysplasia in HIV-infected women, and 2) evaluating the impact of VIA screening and treatment with cryotherapy or LEEP in HIV-infected women with ce rvical (CIN).Results and Conclusions. All work will be perfor med in western Kenya. To date, more than 140 women have enrolled in the study, approximately on e-third of the total nu mber of participants needed. Specimens have been collected for HP V testing, and personnel in the Kenya Medical Research Institute in Kisumu have received training in performing the HPV assay used for the project. The direct outcome of th ese studies will be a better understa nding of the natural history of various HPV types in women with and without HIV infection, the modifiable risk factors for cervical cancer in these women, and the im plications of local therapies for women with CIN lesions. Further studies are being developed including mentored pilot projects related to the main studies. Population Science/Epidemiology FacultyPOSTER #97 PREVALENCE OF ADVANCED COLORECTAL NEOPLASIA IN VETERANS: EFFECT S OF AGE, SEX, AND RACE Thomas Imperiale1 1 Department Of Medicine, Indiana Unive rsity School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN Email: timperia@iu.edu Background: Understanding the e ffects of demographic features o n the risks of colorectal cancer (CRC) and advanced neoplasia (AN) has been difficult because previous stu dies have had relatively small sample sizes and/or uncertain generalizabilit y. While age and male sex are c lear risk factors for colorectal cancer (CRC) and AN, the effect o f race has been less consistent. Objective: To quantify the effects of age, sex, and race on pre valence of AN and CRC among Veterans. Methods: Through remote electroni c data extraction, we identifi ed a cohort of veterans who underwent a first diagnostic or screening colonoscopy between 2002 and 2009 at on e of 14 VA Medical Centers. Colonoscopies done for an indication of inflammatory bowel disease or neoplasia surveillance were excluded. We used natural language processing of colonoscopy and pathology report s to identify the most advanced colorectal findings and location within the colorectum as proximal (spleni c flexure) or distal. AN A total of 90,691 eligible colonoscopies were identified. Mean (SD) patient age was 61.6 (9.4) years; 5.1% (n=4679) were women. Among 72,5 27 (80%) patients whose rac e was known, 55,180 were 14,155 (19.5%) were were Hispani c, and 734 (1.0%) were other. Overall prevalence of AN was 8.9% (n=8082) , of which 14.5% (n=1171) was CRC. AN increased from 4.0% for those < 50 years to 12.1% for those >= 75 years (P<0.0001), and was present in 9.2% of men and 3.9% of women (adjusted OR=2.06%; 95% CI, 1.77-2.39). While age-related increases in AN prevalence were present overall for both sexes, AN prevalence in women < 65 years was 3 .2% to 3.9% (P=0.87). There were no differences in AN prevalence between Blacks (8.96%), Caucasians (9.43%), Hispanics (8.41%), and Other (8.99%) (P=0.14). When CRC prevalence was considered, similar p atterns for age, sex, and race were observed. Among 1096 CRCs where lo cation within the colorectum was ascertained, women had more proximal h ad more distal 4). Within the subgroup of 30,446 (33.6%) screening colonoscopies, the prevalence of CRC and AN were lower; however, the effects of age, sex, and race were similar t o the overall sample. Conclusions: Older age and male sex were strongly associated wi th prevalence of both AN and CRC, while race had no effect on either outcome. Among women aged 50-64 ye ars, the prevalence of AN and CRC was low and remained constant. A ris k-based model based on age, sex , and perhaps other fe atures may be useful for both resource allocation and tailoring CRC screening in Vet erans. Population Science/Epidemiology FacultyPOSTER #98 CADMIUM EXPOSURE AND RISK OF LUNG CANCER: A META-ANALYSIS OF COHORT AND CASE-CONTROL STUDIES AMONG GENERAL AND OCCUPATIONAL POPULATIONS Cheng Chen1 1 Department Of Epidemiology And Biostatistics, Bloomington, IN Email: chen358@indiana.edu The association between cadmium exposure and risk of lung cance r is still unclear. We quantitatively reviewed the observational studies that investigated the associ ation between cadmium exposure and lung cancer risk in both general and occupational populations publis hed through April 2015. The final data set is comprised of three cohort studies in the general population totaling 22,551 participants (354 events) with a mean follow-up of 15 years, five occupational cohort studies in cluding 4205 individuals (180 events) with an average follow-up of 31 years, and three occupa tional case-control studies including 4740 cases and 6268 controls. Comparing the highest to the lowest ca tegory of cadmium exposure, the weighted relative risk and 95% confidence interval of lung cancer in the general population was 1.42 (95% CI (0.91, 2.23)); the weighted risk estimate s (95% CIs) of lung cancer in three occupational cohort studies and three case-control studies were 0.68 (95% CI (0.33, 1.41)) and 1.61 (95% CI (0.94, 2.75)),respectively. No linear association was found. When comparing p articipants exposed to cadmium with non- exposed based on available data, the association became statist ically significant. Acco rding to findings from this meta-analysis, the possibility that cadmium exposure may i ncrease risk of lung cancer cannot be completely ruled out in either general or occupational populati on. Population Science/Epidemiology Graduate StudentPOSTER #99 DIFFERENCES IN CERVICAL CANCER SC REENING KNOWLEDGE, PRACTICES, AND BELIEFS: A LOCAL SURVEY OF MINORITY WOMEN Monica Kasting1, Terrell Zollinger2, Brian Dixon3,4, Nathan Stupiansky5, Gregory Zimet5 1 Epidemiology, Pub lic Health, Ind iana University, Indianapolis, IN 2 Epidemiology, Indian a University, Ind ianapo lis, IN 3 Epid emiology, Veterans Affa irs, Public Health, Indiana Un iversity, India napolis, IN 4 Regenstrief Institu e, Indianapolis, IN 5 Pediatrics, Medicine, India na University, Indianapolis, IN Email: mlkastin@iupui.edu Background: There exist concerns that HPV vaccination could result in decr eased cervical cancer screening rates. This study examines the r elationship between cervical cancer screening rates and HPV vaccination in a local sample of predominately minority women. Methods: In July 2015 we surveyed women between the ages of 21 and 35 ( i.e., born between 1980 and 1994) who attended a minority health fair. We excluded women wh o reported a history of hysterectomy, as well as t hose who had received the HPV vaccine less than 3 year s prior to the survey. Outcomes assessed included: receiving a Papanicolaou (Pap) test within the last t hree years, awareness a nd comfort with current cervical screening recommenda tions, and knowledge regarding the purpose of a Pap test. Results: Responses from 291 women were included in the analysis. The me an age was 28.5 years and 62% were non-Hispanic Black. Most (84% ) received a Pap test in the last three years and one-third (33%) received a t l e a s t o n e H P V v a c c i n e . L o g i s tic regression showed that vacci nated women did not have lower odds of having a Pap test in the past t hree years (OR=1.32; 95% CI=0.66-2.65). In fact, in an adjusted multivariable logistic regression that controlle d for age and race revealed v accinated women were three times more likely to have had a Pap test (AOR=3.06; 95% CI=1.37-6.83). Tw o-thirds (6 4%) of respondents thought average-risk women should get a Pap test every year. Only 26% of women knew t h e p u r p o s e o f a P a p t e s t , a n d t h e proportion who correctly answered this question varied by race. Participants who answe red incorrectly were over four times as likely to be no n-Hispanic Black as compared to those who were White (OR=4.20; 95% CI=2.00-8.81; p<0.001). Conclusions: Women who have been vaccinated for HPV are more likely to have been screened for cervical cancer, alleviating concerns am ong healthcare providers regardi ng whether would decrea se cervical cancer screening due to HPV vaccination. However, many women are unawa re of the purpose of a Pap test and current screening recommendati ons, suggesting the need for bett er health education. Population Science/Epidemiology Graduate StudentPOSTER #100 RACIAL DIFFERENCES IN DIETARY CHANGES AND QUALITY OF LIFE AFTER A COLORECTAL CANCER DIAGNOSIS: A FOLLOW-UP OF THE STUDY OF OUTCOM ES IN COLORECTAL CANCER SURVIVORS (SOCCS) COHORT Of Ep idemiology And Biostatistics, School Of Public Health, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN 2 Gastroenterology And Hep atology, School Of Medicine, University Of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC Email: lewiscm@indiana.edu BACKGROUND: Significant racial disparities exist in colorectal cancer diag nosis and survival. OBJECTIVE: Exploratory studyto assess the ra cial differences in dietary ch ange in relation to quality of life (QoL), recurrence and survival after receiving a colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis. DESIGN: Four hundred fifty-three stage-I I CRC patients were enrolled i nto the cohort study via the North Carolina Central Cancer R egistry. Self-reported diet, physical activity, treatment, comorbidities, demographic characteristics and QoL were collect ed at diagnosis, 12, and 24 months post-diagnosis. QoL was assessed with the FACT-C and SF-12 inventories. An overall dietary index score was calculated. Generaliz ed estimating equations and logistic regression models were utilized to explore potential associations. RESULTS: African Americans (AAs) (n=81) were more likely to increase in takes of reduced fat milk, vegetables, and fruit (p<0.05) compared to Caucasians (n=184) 24 months following diagnosis. AAs also decreased their intakes of regular cheese, red meat, fried food, fast food, and fat (p<0.05), comparably. The least-square means (standard errors) for change s in dietary index were 6.05 (0.40) and 4.07 (0.27) for AAs and Caucasians, respectively ( P<0.001). AAs exhibited higher scores on portions of the FACT-C (CCS: \u00df=1.04, 95%CI: 0.51, 4.48). While there was no significant difference in survival and recurrence between racial sub-groups, those who improved their dietary quality over 24 months had lower risk of recurrence and mortality overall (OR: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.72). CONCLUSIONS: AAs made more healthful changes in diet and had a higher quali ty of life compared to Caucasians in this s tudy using self-reported dietar y data. No racial differences in recurrence or survival were evident, even though improvements i n dietary quality did reveal survival benefits overall. More prospectiv e research on racial dispariti es in health behavior changes post- diagnosis are desperately needed. Population Science/Epidemiology Post-Doctoral/Medical FellowPOSTER #101 IDENTIFICATION AND IMAGING OF NOVEL METABOLIC HUBS OF BREAST CANCER WITH PROGNOSTIC VALUE Laurie Littlepage1 1 Chemistry And Biochemistry, Unive rsity Of Notre Dame, South Bend, IN Email: laurie.littlepage@nd.edu The complex yet interrelated c onnections between cancer metabolism, gene expression, and oncogenic driver genes have the potential to identify novel biomarkers and drug targets with prognostic and therapeutic value. The goal of this study was to generate global metabolic profile s of breast tumors isolated from multiple transgenic mouse models and to com pare these profiles with gene expression data to develop a network analysis, and to use that networ k to identify critical metaboli c pathways in breast Using GC-MS, LC- MS/MS, and capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE)-MS platforms, we quantified and compared the levels of 374 metabolites in breast tumor tissue from normal tissue and t ransgenic mouse breast cancer models overexpressing a panel of oncogene s (PyMT, PyMT-DB, Wnt1, , and C3-TAg). We developed a network analysis that capt ures the interac tions between m etabolic profiling and gene expression data. Our network analysis identified 35 metabolite and 33 gene \"hubs \" that had the most network correlations. These hubs have prognostic value and likely are integral to tum or metabolism and breast cancer. They are candidate breast cancer metabo lites ('oncometabolites') and genes that promote breast cancer. We show in this study that gene hubs can affect cancer progression. In add ition, we detected metabolite localization patterns and concentration gradie nts across tumor tissue by MAL DI imaging. Metabolite s were detected in b ot h c an ce r c el l s a s w el l as wi t h in the tumor microenvironment with distinct spatial resolution, suggesting regulated metabolic heterogeneity across tumor tissue. Translational/Clincal Research FacultyPOSTER #102 NOVEL MICROSOFT EXCEL PROGRAM TO PARSE VARIAN ECLIPSE DATA Ronald Shapiro1,2, Jonathan Corn2, Neil Estabrook2, Helen Fosmire1,2, Bruce Lulu2, Edward Man nina1 1 IU School Of Medicine, Department Of Radiation Oncology, Indianapolis, IN 2 Richard L. Roudebush VA Medical Center, Department Of Radiation Oncology, Indianapolis, IN Email: shapiror@iupui.edu Introduction: Cancer patients are regularly treated with radiotherapy. The departments of radiation oncology at Indiana University, Methodist Hospital, and the Richard L. Roudebush VA Medical Cente r create radiation plans using software called Ec lipse, a product of the Varian co mpany. In order to avoid toxicities by overdosing critical structures, E clipse produces a graph called a dose-volume histogram (DVH) that allows radiation oncologists to evaluate the dose delivered to a certa in organ or the cancer target volumes. Rather than visually estimate these val ues, a novel Microsoft Excel pr ogram extracts exported data and calculates the desired dosimetric qualifiers. Methods: This program \"Stereotactic Radiotherapy (SBRT) of the Lung for Primary Tumors\" but can be modified for any pat ient data set. Normal organ data of interest included esophagus, lungs, proximal bronchial tree, chest wall, spinal cord, brachial plexus, heart, aorta, skin, and stomach. The gross tumor vo lume (GTV), internal target vol ume (ITV), and the planning target volume (PTV) were also evaluated. Exampl es of meaningful DVH data inc luded the mean and max doses to certain structures, the dose being received by 1 or 5 ccs (D1cc or D5cc), the volume receiving 20 Gy (V20), and the percent PTV covered by the prescription isodose line. Results: Exporting the DVH in a tabular format produces a sing le column of data. This column was imported into the Excel program. For each organ or target volume, multi ple rows of data are produced in increments of 0.1 cGy. Each row includes in a character string: the dose in cGy, the relative dose (%) and the volume in ccs which receive the aforementioned dose. If an organ received a maximum of 6000cGy, then 60,000 lines of code were produced. The strings were transformed into their nu merical correlates, and calculations were performed to displa y the desired data. Conclusion: An easily modifiable Microscoft Excel spreadsheet was created to handle large amounts of DVH data and display the resu lts in an organized format. Translational/Clincal Research FacultyPOSTER #103 LETROZOLE AND OVARIECTOMY CAUSE BONE LOSS, MUSCLE WEAKNESS, AND INCREASED BREAST CANCER BO NE METASTASES IN MICE Laura Wright1 1 Department Of Medicine, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN Email: laewrig@iu.edu Adjuvant endocrine therapy using an aromatase inhibitor (AI) is a standard treatment for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breas t cancer. Unfortunately, 50% of women treated with an AI develop musculoskeletal complications. Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated bone loss and muscle weakness in ovariectomiz ed (OVX) mice. We therefore hypothesized that complete estrogen deprivation using the AI le trozole would cause more profound muscle weakness and bone loss than OVX alone, and that this high bone turnover state could accelerate the progression of breast cancer bone metastases and negatively impact muscle function. To test this, four-week female athymic nude mice underwent OVX or sham surgery and were treated daily with vehicle or A I (10\u00b5g/day; n=20/group). Two we eks after surgery and onset of treatment, bone mineral density was reduced in OVX-AI mice rela tive to vehicle-shams (p<0.01) as assessed computed tomography tibia was reduced by 53% is OVX-vehicle mice (p<0.001) and by 67% in OVX-AI mice (p<0.001) relative to vehicle-sham. After confirming bone loss, the same animals were inoculated with ER-negative MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells into the left cardiac ventricle and w ere followed for osteolytic lesion formation (n=10-15/group). Since MDA-MB-231 is ER-negative, eff ects of complete estrogen deprivation should be indirect. Fi ve weeks after inoculation, osteolytic lesion area was larger in OVX-AI mice relative to sham-vehicle (p=0.0215), while OVX or A I alone did not alter lytic lesion area. Skeletal muscle function was assessed by ex vivo measurem ent of maximal contractile and 7% r educed by 12% in OVX-AI mice (p<0.001) relative to sham-vehicle. Our murine studies confirm that AI treatment induces bone loss and skeletal muscle weakness, recapitulating effects in cancer patients. As hypothesized, the severe bone loss resulting from AI- induced estrogen depletion may prime the bone microenvironment for the development of breast cancer metastases to bone and pot entiate muscle weakness. This model serves as an excellent tool to study the mechanisms of underlying musculoskeletal defects i n cancer patients and assess potential therapeutics. Translational/Clincal Research FacultyConclusion We conclude that the biomarker panel measured at diagnosis or d ay +100 post-HCT may allow patient stratification according to risk of cGVHD. Translational/Clincal Research FacultyPOSTER #105 USE OF TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATOR L IKE EFFECTOR-TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS (TALE-TFS) TO INDUCE CYP1A2 GENE EXPRESSION AND Indianapolis, IN 2 Medicine: Division Of Clinical Pharmacology, Indianapolis, IN 3 Medical & Molecular Genetics, Indianapolis, IN 4 Children's Mercy Hospital, Indianapolis, IN Email: ksburges@iu.edu BACKGROUND: miRNAs are predicted to regulate the ex pression of several CYP genes, but these predictions need to be validated in cells that express the endogeno us CYP genes. We used TALE-TFs to induce CYP1A2 expression in HeLa and HepG2 cells and validate the miRNA predictions. METHODS: Four TALE-TFs that target the CYP1A2 pr omoter were designed and transfected into HeLa and HepG2 cells. TALE-TFs we re then cotransfected into HeLa and HepG2 cells with either miRNAs predicted to target CYP1 A2, inhibitors of those miRNAs, or C. elegans miRNA negative control. CYP1A2 mRNA expression was measured using quantitative PCR that was normalized to GAPDH. RESULTS: The transfection of all four TALE-TFs cells increased CYP1A2 mRNA levels 164- and 189-fold, respectively, compared t o t h e e m p t y v e c t o r c o n t r o l . I n H e L a c e l l s increased CYP1A2 expression was observed when th e inhibitors of the four miRNAs re duced expression. No changes where observed in HepG2 cells.CONCLUSION: TALE-TFs can be used to induce CYP1A2 expression. The increased expression of CYP1A2 mRNA in cells transfecte d with miRNA inhibitors suggests that miRNAs regulate CYP1A2 expression either directly or indirectly. The differe ntial effect of the miRNA inhibitors in HeLa vs HepG2 cells further suggests that the miRNA effects on CYP1A2 ar e cell type specific.

The majority of studies so far have focused on detecting ctDNA from patients wi th metastatic disease. Herein, we tested whether ctDNA could be used as a biomarker to predict re lapse in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: BRE09-146 was a Phase II clinical trial t hat randomized TNBC patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy to Cisplatin or Cisplatin+Rucaparib. From the combination arm, 1ml of plasma was collected at four time points post-surgery. In total, 38 patients with matched tumor, blood, and plasma were analyzed. E xtracted DNA underwent library preparation and amplification us ing the Oncomine Research Panel consisting of 134 cancer genes, followed by high-coverage se quencing and bioinformatics. RESULTS: We first somatic mutations in pr imary tumors. TP53 mutations were the most prevalent (79%) followed by PIK3CA (16%). We the n analyzed the plasma- sequencing data to detect the same mutations in the circulation. Out of 38 patients, 13 patients had a clinical relapse (median trial follow-up for disease free sur vival = 24 months). Of the 13 patients, we detected somatic ctDNA in 4 patients (3 TP53 mutations, 1 AK T mutation). Notably, all 4 patients had a rapid recurrence (0.3, 4.0, 5.3 and 8.9 months). Overall, patients whose ctDNA was detected had inferior disease free survivial residual diease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy can predict recurrence with high speci ficity, but moderate sensitivity. For those patients where ctDNA is detected, recurrence is rapid. Translational/Clincal Research Graduate StudentPOSTER #107 AN ANGIOGENESIS GENE SIGNATURE P OINTS TO ACTIVE PATHWAYS IN A SUBSET OF HUMAN PANCREATIC DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA CANCER PATIENTS T HAT ARE DISTINCT FROM PATHWAYS IN PANCREATIC NEUROENDOCRINE TUMORS Kelly Craven1, Jesse Gore2, Julie 1 Biochemistry And Molecular Biology, Indiana Univ ersity School Of Medici ne, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN 2 Medicine, Indiana University School Of Me dicine, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN Email: which comprises 85% of pancreatic cancers, is the 4th leading cause of cancer death in the United States with a 5-year surviv al of 8%. While human PDACs they also overexpress a number of angiogenic growth factors and receptors. Additionally, the use of anti-angiogenic agents in murine models of PDAC leads to reduced tumor volume, tumor spread, and microvessel density, and improved survival. Nonetheless, clini cal trials using anti-a ngiogenic therapy have been overwhelmingly unsuccessful i n hPDAC. On the other hand, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) account for only 5% of pa ncreatic tumors, yet they are very vascular and classically angiogenic, respond to anti-angiogenic th erapy, and confer a better prognosis than PDAC even in the metastatic setting. By analyzing the recently expande d TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atla s) dataset, we report here that an angiogenesis gene signa ture is present in ~35% of PDACs and is mostly distinct from an angiogenesis signature present in PNETs. Additionally, principal component analysis (PCA) of the entire or angiogenic PDAC and PNET transcriptomes fro m TCGA indicates that there are large differences in gene expression between these two tumor types. For example, PDACs exhibit a tran scriptome that reflects active TGF-beta signaling, and up-regulation of several pro-inflammatory genes, including members of JAK signaling pathways. Functionally, targeti ng the TGF-beta type I blocks proliferative crosstalk human pancre atic cancer cells and hu man endothelial cells. Tumors from the KRC (oncogenic Kras, deleted Rb1) PDAC mouse model show superior enrichment and differential expression of the a ngiogenic gene signature compar ed to tumors from the KPC (oncogenic Kras, mutated Tr p53) PDAC mouse model. Moreover KRC and with ruxolitinib suppresses PDAC progression in KRC mice but not in KPC mice. These findings suggest that targeting both TGF-beta and JAK signaling in th e 35% of PDAC patients whose ca ncers exhibit an angiogenesis gene signature should be explored in the clinic and that this could lead to improved response s to anti-angiogenic therapy in PDAC.

Our patient derived x enografts (PDX) models carry uni que helical domain mutations in the PI3KCA gene that are known to be highly deregulated in bladder cancer. This sets our models as unique tools for understanding the molecular background that wo uld dictate an optimal response to targeting the PI3K pathway in vivo as well as the potential mec hanisms of resistance. Methods : RNA-seq was carried out to understand the molecular make up of our PDX models (RP-B-01 and RP-B-02) and to identify clinically relevant drug targets. In-vivo drug testing was done using a dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitor to test the response to this class of drugs . Cell lines derived from the PDX models were used for in-vitro studies to validate our in-vivo d ata and to calculate the IC-50 for this class of agents in our cell lines. Western blot was used to ass ess the molecular effects of these agents using both in-vivo specimens as well as cell lines that were treated in vitro. Results: Our RNA-seq data have shown that our models (RP-B-01 and RP-B-02) a re molecularly distinct where RP-B-01 has a basal-like phenotype while RP-B-02 is has a lumin al like phenotype. Additionally; they carry two unique helical domain mutations in the PI3KCA ge ne (E542K and E545K mutations respectively). Despite the molecular similarity between these t wo mutations, the two models responded differently to a dual PI3K-mTOR inhibiter in vivo; where RP-B-02 tumor model significantly responded to the dr ug compared to vehicle treated mice (P Value = 0.03) while the RP- B-01 model was resistant. Cell lines derived from these models were able to recapitulate the same phenotype in-vitro and IC-50 for each cell line was significant ly different (IC50 for RP-B-01 cells = 204.1 nM; nM). Western blot anal ysis has shown that despite the ability of the dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitor to hit the target in RP-B-02 PDX, it was not able to do the same in the other model (RP-B-01). Interestingly, supplementin g media with insulin and nutrients switched the response phenotype and rendered cells derived from the RP-B-02 model more resistant to the PI3K-mTOR inhibitor. Conclusion: Response to PI3K pathway inhibitors in bladder cancer is not only dictated by the presence of targetable mutat ions but more importantly by the molecular make up of individual tumors which should be taken in to account when using these agents in the clinic.

Of Medicine, Division Of Clinical Pharmacology, Indianapolis, IN 3 Obstetrics And Gynecology, Indianapolis, IN Email: kukunapa@umail.iu.edu The efficacy and safety of drugs are typically linked to the dr ug's pharmacokinetic properties. Clinically, drug concentrations are usually determined in plasma. However, distribution of drug can exhibit a high inter-tissue var iability, and target site drug concentration can significantly vary from plasma concentration. Knowledge of drug concentration in target tissues is fundamental in the determination of clinical drug activity. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling is a useful tool to predict tissue c oncentration of drugs. In this s tudy, we develop a PBPK model to predict tissue concentrations of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib. The PBPK model was defined by a set of ordinary differential equations was coded in R using the lsoda package. Physiologic and drug specific parameters were obtained from the literature. Ti ssue specific concentration-time profiles for brain, liver, and ki dney of mice receiving imatini b were obtained from the literature. As imatinib tissue-specific partition coefficients not available, these were predicted from the physiochemical properties of the drug and by fitting select par ameters. Acceptability criteria include predicted Cmax and AUC within 2-fold of observed values. An interspecies extrapolation was performed utilizing tissue partition coefficients determined in mice to predict the tissue concentration of imatinib in humans. The mouse model was able to estimate pl asma AUC within 1.5-fold of the observed AUC for an orally administered dose of imatinib. Brain exposure was predicted to be within <10% of the observed values. After extrapolation to humans, the model was able to produce a predicted plasma exposure within 30% of the observed data. T he PBPK model for imatinib is able to accurately predict tissue concentrations in mice can be used to predict tissue concentrations of imatinib in humans.

A dose-limiting side effect of VCR is peripheral neuropathy, whic h presents as paresthesia in fingers and toes and in severe cases can lead to paralysis. These adver se effects may be related to drug exposure. VCR is predominantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) enzymes. We have observed that neuropathy is more severe in patients with polymorphisms in CYP3A5 that lead to reduced clearance of VCR. Here we utilize in vitro metabolism data to develop a PBPK model for VCR and to explore the effect of CYP3A5 genotype on VCR exposur e. Methods: Simcyp v. 15 used to develop a physiologically b ased pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for VCR. Volume of distribution was predicted using the Rodgers and Rowland method. Hepatic metabolism by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 were extrapolated from in vitro data from human liver microsomes (HLM) and recombinant CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. Bilia ry clearance was determined from clinical reports. The robus tness of the model was determined by comparing simulated concentration-time profiles with published VCR pharmacokinetic data. The model was deemed acceptable if pharmac okinetic parameters cal culated were within 2-fold of observed parameters. Results: For the adult cancer p atient, this PBPK model was abl e to adequately predict VCR plasma concentration. The predicted sy stemic clearance (CL) of 10.7 L/h (95% CI 11.5 - 14.9 L/h) was within the range of reported values (7.4 -35 L/h). The predict ed volume of distribution (V) of 13.5 L was also consistent with observed V. The estimated median CL of VCR in CYP3A5 expressers was nearly 4-fold higher than in vs 9.9 L/h , p<0.05). model accounting for the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5- mediated clearance of VCR simulated plasma concentrations r eported in adult cancer patients. This model indicates that individuals who express CYP3A5 e xhibit a higher exposure to VCR than nonexpressers, which may lead to increased risk of neurotoxicity. Translational/Clincal Research Graduate StudentPOSTER #111 TARGETING NON-CODING RNA HOTAIR WITH TUMOR SPECI FIC PEPTIDES REVERSES CHEMOTHERAPY RE SISTANCE IN OVARIAN CANCER Ali Ozes1 1 Molecular And Cellular Biochemistry, Medical Scie nces, Indiana University, Bloomington, Bloomington, IN Email: arozes@indiana.edu he recently discovered long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as key contributors to cancer biology. O cRNA that has attracted significant attention is the Hox transcr ipt antisense intergenic RNA termed HOTAI pressed from the developmental HOXC locus located on chromosome 12q13.13 9. By shuttling the polyco m pressive complex (PRC2) to specific gene targets , (H3K27me3) and uniquely exerts epigenetic repression in trans on dist a romosomes. Although a vital role for HOTAIR in ovarian cancer (OC), the fif th leading cause of cancer death S. women and the deadliest form of all gynecological cancers was recently suggested, its biological role remai usive.Our group has recently shown that HOTAIR contributes to ci splatin (CDDP) resistance by activating NF- \u00bf ring DNA damage leading to incr eased MMP-9 expression. Furtherm ore, treatment with high dose of CDDP le a NF-\u00bfB dependent cellular senescence commonly associated with in creased IL-6 secretion and CD D sistance (Ozes et al. Oncogene. In press). Moreover, studies on functional roles of HOTAIR in cancer indic a at targeting HOTAIR may have therapeutic importance. In this study, we introduce an \"anti-lncRNA\" deliv e ent using sequence-specific peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) that bind to previously validated single strand e gions of HOTAIR and inhibit its interaction with the PRC2. We sh ow the candidate PNAs to be non-toxic a ave minimal effect on cell proliferation. We further show PNAs have specific effects in OC cells with elevat e vels of HOTAIR and can inhibit invasion, chemotherapy , activation a novel that elivered in vivo to the acidic microenvironment (pH approximatel y 6) of solid tumors. In mouse xenograft mod e e anti-lnc suppressed HOTAIR oncogenic activity, nhibited formation of high-grade serous ovari a mors, and increased survival.

Translational/Clincal Research Graduate StudentPOSTER #112 NOVEL COMBINATION Email: npulliam@indiana.edu Ovarian cancer recurrence has been shown to be associated with increased DNA damage response (DDR) mediated by poly-(ADP)-ribose polymerase 1/2 (P ARP1/2), which can be therapeutically targeted by PARP inhibitors are indicated for platinum- responsive, BRCA-mutated high-grade serous ovarian cancer, but most ovarian cancer patients have BRCA-proficient disease. Based on our previous st udies supporting a role for DNA methylation in chemoresistant ovarian cancer, mediated by t he enzyme DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), and reports on a functional role f or DNMT1 in DNA damage repair, we hypothesize that combining a DNMTi and PARPi will im pair BRCA-mediated DDR, resulting in cytotoxicity in ovarian cancer cells. A pane l of ovarian cancer cell lines (A2780, platinum sensitive, BRCA1/2-wild type; us Kuramochi, platinum resistant, BRCA2 mutant) was examined for cell growth using colony formation assays after tr eatment with DNMTi guadecitabine (low dose, 20-100nm) and PARPi talazoparib (1-10n m), alone or in combination. In all ovarian ca ncer cell lines, while high dose s (10nm) of talazoparib alone reduced (P<0.05) colony formation, combining guadecitabine with talazoparib resulted in decreased (P<0.05) survival at all doses examined. To focus more specifically on BRCA status, we utilized two high-grade serous ovarian cancer cell l ines (\"PEO\") derived from the same patient but harboring a mut ant (PEO1) or wild type (PEO4) BRCA2 gene (Langdon et al, Sakai Treatment with guadecit nm, 3 days) increased (P<0.05) PARP levels ( western blot analysis) as well as enzymatic activity (P<0.05; ELISA analysis), while talazoparib treatment alone inc reased (P<0.05) DNMT1 levels and decreased (P<0.05) PA RP enzymatic activity. Treatmen t with guadecitabine or talazoparib alone had no effect on cell proliferation; however, combining the two drugs inhibited (P<0.05) PEO1 and PEO4 proliferation and increased (P <0.05) apoptosis (caspase 3 cleavage) in both cell lines.

An emerging model indicates that non-OCSCs may dedifferentiate under certain circumstances, and a critical role for the IL-6 sign aling pathway in converting non-CS Cs to CSC has been suggested. We investigated the mechanism contributing to OCSC enrichment after platinum the CSC marker ALDH1A1, resulting in CSC enrichment. In addition, based on our previous study on targeting OCSCs by hypomethylating agent guadecitabine (SGI-110), we IL-6 antibody (IL-6Nab) with SGI-110 as maintenance strategy to eradicat e OCSCs in tumor residuals after chemotherapy. We demonstrated that cisplatin (CDDP, respective IC 50 dose) induced (P<0.05) IL-6 up to 96h post-treat ment, suggesting a role of tumor IL-6 secretion. By that ALDH (+) cells expressed increased (P<0.05) IL-6 r e c e p t o r l e v e l s a n d s e c r e t e d h i g h e r ( P < 0 . 0 5 ) l e v e l s o f I L - 6 i n t o t h e media compared to ALDH (-) cells. Treatment of OC ce lls with IL-6 (100ng/ml)/CDDP enriched the percentage of ALDH (+), and this enrichment was inhibited (P<0.0 5) by IL-6-Nab (400ng/ml) plus SGI-110 (100nM transactivated (p <0.05) ALDH1A1 reporter gene expression in ALDH (-) cells, which was blocked by IL-6-Nab, and that IL-6- or CDDP increased (P<0.05) ALDH1A1, pSTAT3 or pERK protein expression in OC cells, which was in hibited (P<0.05) by SGI-110 plus IL6Nab combination treatemnt. Moreover, our in vivo study demonstrated that SGI-110 combined with IL-6-Nab as \"maintenance therapy\" significantly reduced ALDH (+) population in platinum-treated tumor residuals and delayed tumor relapse. Our data indicate that IL-6 is a potent regulator of ALDH1A1 expression and the OCSC phenotype. We suggest that a combination approach of IL-6 Nab with SGI-110 could represent a novel maintenance strategy after chemot herapy for eradicating OCSCs an d preventing tumor recurrence. Translational/Clincal Research Graduate StudentPOSTER #114 SYSTEMATIC COMPARISON OF MRNA AN D PHOSPHOPROTEINS EXPRESSION IN BREAST CANCER SUBTYPE FROM CELL LINES TO TISSUE Aida Yazdanparast1, Lang Li1, Lijun Cheng1 1 Department Of Medical And Molecular Geneti cs, School Of Medicine, IU, Indianapolis, IN Email: ayazdanp@umail.iu.edu Background: Whether the observed variation in transcriptome can predict the variation in proteome has not been fully investigated in subtypes of breast cancer. In addition, it is h ighly critical to study whether transcriptome/proteome correlati ons can be preserved in the cel l line model when it is derived from primary tumor. Here, we attemp t to address the transcriptome/proteome a ssociations in a candidate set of gene/proteins using breast cancer tumor tissues and cell lines. Method: Reverse-phase protein arrays (R PPA) were used to measure 313 protein expressions and 46 protein phosphorylations among 421 primary breast tumors from Cancer Ge nome Atlas (TCGA) and 33 cell lines of breast cancer. Correlation analys is between mRNA and RPPA was c onducted and compared between primary tissues and cell lines in differ ent breast cancer subtypes. Hig hly concordant genes/proteins are further analyzed using pathway analysis.Results: I n t h e b r e a s t c a n c e r l u m i n a l A / B subtype, high mRNA/RPPA correlations were consistently observed for ER-alpha and PR in both cell line (0.71,0.677), an d primary tissue, (0.90, 0.809). In high mRNA/RPPA correlations in HER2 were in the primary tissue (0.85, 0.78), and cell (0.73, 0.65). In the basal like correlated mRNA/RPPA expressions were observed in Cyclin E1, GATA3, and AR, which are (0.8, 0.83, 0.7 ) in the primary tumor tissues and (0.85, 0.59, 0.7) in the breast cancer cell lines. The overall correl ation of mRNA/RPPA corre lation betwee n cell line and primary tissue is 0.71. We observed that protein expression is affected by different gene isoforms. In addition, mTOR/PI3K pathway is iden tified to have strong function in basal like subtype of breast cancer. Conclusion: Strong mRNA/RPPA associations we re observed in each breast can cer subtype, ER-alpha and PR in the luminal A/B, in Her2+, and Cyclin E1, G and AR in the basal like. These strong mRNA/RPPA associations are highly concordant between cel l lines and primary tissues. Since most of these genes are well known drug targets, the highly concordance gene/RPPA associations not only confirm the gene expression biomarkers can ser ved as surrogates for their p rotein products in the drug and target selections, but also imply that breast cancer cell lines shall serve as good models for primary tumor tissues.

This method utilizes a pulsed las er to excite the overtone transition of target molecular bonds inside of tissue, resulting in a local temperat ure rise and in turn detectable acoustic signals. Such laser-induced acoustic signal can be detected by ultrasoun d (US) transducers, which are extensively used in clinics, and then used to reconstruct a molecular map of the tissue. VPAT can provide molecular information at imaging depth be yond conventional optical imagin g methods, since the detected signal is an acoustic wave rather than photons , which encounter strong scatt ering in tissue. We have developed a mobile VPAT imaging system to be applied to clinical practice. Our system is comprised of a Nd:YAG laser-pum ped barium nitrite Raman laser t o output 1197 nm laser, which excites the second overtone of the C-H bond stretch. 128-element US transdu cer arrays are used to detect the photoacoustic signal a nd standard US signal. We have demonstrated an imaging depth of greater than or equal to 5 mm with 100 \u00b5m imaging resolution of lipid detection. Curr ently, we are applying this VPAT imaging system to the two forms of cancer with the highest incidence: b reast cancer and prostate cancer. In regards to breast cancer, the necessary lag-time of traditio nal histopathological analysis to confirm complete removal of breast tumor in the breast conserving surge ry, or lumpectomy, leads to an average re- operation rate of 25% in clinical practice. We apply our VPAT i maging system to image the lipid that surrounds the breast tumor to determine the success of the lump ectomy, which is defined as a minimum of 2 mm of normal tissue surrounding the tumor. VPAT in this applica tion has the advantage to be performed within minutes to guide the surgeon to remove additional tissue to reduce the re-operation rate. Our preliminary data on 40 breast ti ssue samples procured from a ti ssue bank procedures suggests a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 90% in margin assessment. In current prostate cancer dia gnosis, transrectal ultrasound-gu ided biopsy is used to confirm and grade prostate cancer. Due to the non-targeted nature of this procedure, a high false negative rate is present and repeat biopsies may be needed to identify a prostate cancer tum or. We apply our VPAT imaging system to identify the location and size of prostate cancer tumors by uti lizing the recently discovered contrast of cholesteryl ester accumulation whi ch correlates specifically wi th increasing prostate tumor aggressiveness. Translational/Clincal Research MD/PhD student POSTER #116 CLINICAL UTILITY OF ALTERNATIVE S PLICING EVENTS A CROSS TUMOR TY PES Matthew Segar1, Yunlong Liu2 1 Center For Computational Biology And Bioinformatics, Indiana University School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 2 Center For Computational Biology And Bioinfor matics, Medical And Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School Of Me dicine, Indianapolis, IN Email: msegar@iupui.edu The application of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologie s and biological data repositories, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), allow researchers unmatched access to geno mic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic data. One area which remains unexplored, however, is alternativ e splicing, an important genetic regulatory mechanism allowing for a limited number of genes to generate widely diverse gene products, and its potential clinical utility. In this study, we developed a protocol to determine the effect of alter native splicing events on the prognosis of cancer survival. We retrospectively predicted patient survival using molecular d ata from 4,131 samples across 15 cancer types from TCGA. Incorporating matched clinical data to the molecular samples, we used a univariate Cox proportional hazards model to determine significant alternative splicing events. We then randomly split the patient data into training and test sets and built a predictive model using the Supervised PCA meth od. We identified multiple splicing events associated with patient overall survival in 5 cancer types. Subsequent uns upervised hierarchical clustering on the alternative splicing events identified 3 novel molecular subgroups in triple-negativ e b r e a s t c a n c e r ( T N B C ) w i t h v a r y i n g p a t i e n t s u r v i v a l outcome (P = 0.03). Similar patterns were identified in both he ad and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) (P = 0.04) and breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) (P = 0.02). We further exp lored the upstream regulator of the 94 splicing events that are associated with overall survival in BRCA and found 33 of the alternative splicing events regulated by the same motif corresponding to the HNRNPF (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein F) RNA binding protei n. Furthermore, overlap of the 33 alternative splicing events with known proto- oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes showed high similarity (74%). Our study provides the first pipeline to dete rmine clinical survival based on alternative splicing events. Our protocol not only incorporates molecular data and clinical utility, but also enables us to understand the molecular mechanism behind transformative medicine. Translational/Clincal Research Medical StudentPOSTER #117 VIRTUAL SURGICAL PLANNING FOR IMPLANT SUPPORTED AURICULAR PROSTHETICS: THREE SCANNING TECHNIQUES Travis Bellicchi1, Ahmed Cade Jacobs3 1 Graduate Prosthodontics, Indiana Universi ty School Of Dentistry, Indianapolis, IN 2 Graduate Orthodontics, Indiana University School Of Dentistry 3 Media Arts And Science, Indiana Unive rsity School Of Informatics And Computing Email: tbellicc@iupui.edu Objective: To determine the most efficient, accurate method scanning in implant-supported auricular prosthetics. Implant -supported auricular prosthetics are ideally suited for virtual surgical planning. Since most patients have an inta ct contralateral ear, it can be used to virtually model the ear that is missing due to cancer, trauma, or congenital defect. Imaging data may b e acquired from the intact ear by a variety of 3-dimensional image capture methods including photogrammetry and laser scanning. Once data is captured from the intact ear, it can be copied, mirrored, and placed in the appropriate position for virtual surgical implant planning and surgical gui de design. At Indiana University School of Dentistry, the Department of Orthodontics collaborates with the Department of Prosthodontics to help scan facial prosthetic patients. Scanners include 3DMD Face extra oral photogrammetry, CareStream intraoral scanner, and a desktop laser scanner from OrthoInsight. Each technology has strengths and we aknesses when used for scanning facial features. This poster discusses those strengths and weaknesses in the context of an on-going clinical case from the Department of Prosthodontics. Conclusion: 3DMD Face photogr ammetry is the recommended facial scanning technology due to the ease of use, speed of image acqu isition, and acceptable anatomic detail registration. Although other options capture fine anatomic detail better, the significant advantages of 3DMD Face make this the preferred option for facial scanning in virt ual surgical planning implant supported auricular prosthetics. Translational/Clincal Research Post-Doctoral/Medical FellowPOSTER #118 REPEAT STEREOTACTIC BODY THERAPY FOR LIVER TUMORS James Galle1 1 Radiation Oncology, Indianapolis, IN Email: jgalle@iupui.edu Purpose : Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for liver tumors has high rates of local control (LC) and acceptable toxicity. So me patients develop recurrent hepatic di sease and additional SBRT can be considered; however, outcomes after repeat SBRT are not well described. Materials and Methods : 383 patients treated with liver SBRT at a single institution from 2006-2016 were reviewed; 16 patients underwent m u l t i p l e S B R T c o u r s e s . 7 p a t i e n ts were re-treated for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 1 for cholangiocarcinoma, and 8 for metastases (LM). 2 patients with HCC were excluded; 1 for incomplete radiation plans and 1 who had routine liver tr ansplant after 1 fraction of repeat SBRT without toxicity. 2 patients received a 3rd course of SBRT. Results : Median dose for patients with primary liver tumors (PLT) was 48 Gray (Gy)/ 3 fractions for the 1st SBRT and 40 Gy/ 5 fractions for 2nd SBRT, compared to 54 Gy/ 3 fractions and 50 Gy/ 5 fractions fo r LM for the 1st and 2nd SBRT, respectively. Median follow up was 18.2 months in livin g patients. Crude LC for the 1st and 2nd treatment was 78.6% and 85.7%, respectively. For the whole co hort, mean progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) from the 2nd SBRT were 11.9 and 28.1 mont hs, respectively. PFS was significantly shorter in patients with LM compared to PLTs with median values of 4.3 vs 18.4 months, respectively ( p=0.01), but there was no difference in OS between the two groups (me dian 20.7 vs. 26.6 months, p=0.18). Change in liver vo lume between the 1st and 2nd SBRT courses was predictive of PFS and OS (p=0.05 and p=0.02, respectively). Median OS in patients with liver volume loss be tween SBRT courses was 13.1 vs 42.5 months in patients without volume loss ( p=0.01, HR 5.17 [0.83-32.37]). 2nd S B R T w a s w e l l tolerated, but severe liver decompensation was seen in both patients receiving a 3rd SBRT course. Conclusion: A 2nd course of liver SBRT is safe and associated with high LC; howe ver, PFS differs between patients with PLT and LM. Patients with liver volume loss appe ar to have worse outcomes. Significant toxicity occurred in both patients undergoing a 3rd SBRT. Weaknesses of this study include its retrospective nature and low patient numbers. Translational/Clincal Research Post-Doctoral/Medical FellowPOSTER #119 THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ENDOMET RIAL CANCER SENTINEL LYMPH NODE MICRO AND MACRO METASTASES AND UTERINE PATHOLOGY FEATURES Hilary Hinshaw1 1 OB/GYN, Division Of Gyneco logic Oncology, Indianapolis, IN Email: hhinshaw@iupui.edu Objectives: The practice of selective lymphadenectomy based on uterine pathology risk factors has been popularized after risk fa ctors for lymph node metastases were identified in large observational single institution an d cooperative group studies. Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) biopsy is an alternative staging technique proposed to over come the limitations of selective algorithms. The clinical validity of low-volume metastases identi fied in SLN specimens that have been ultrastaged has been questioned. The objective of this analysis is to identify whether patients with positive SLNs demonstrate the previously identified risk factors for lymph node metastases. Methods: The Fluorescence Imaging for Robotic Endometr ial cancer Sentinel node mapping (FIRES) trial is a multi-institution, prospective cohort study measuring the accura cy of SLN mapping in clinical stage I endometrial cancer (all histologies) in identifying metastatic disease. All patients received a standardized SLN mapping technique with cervical indocyanine gr een (ICG) injection and robotic fluorescence imaging, followed by hysterectomy with pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. All H&E-negati ve cytokeratin. re the of disease: macro metastases versus micro metastases [<2 mm and isolated tumor cells]) were evaluated along with uterine tumor risk factors. Fisher's exact test was used to compare dichotomous variables between groups. Results: Among 308 patients, 37 (12%) had nodal meta stases, 30 of whom mapped at 1 SLN (81%). Twelve patients (32%) with nodal metastases were detected only with IHC (=2 mm). Compared with patients with macr o metastases, micro metastases were less likely to be associated with high grade ( P=0.04) or nonendometrioid histology ( P lymphovascular P= 0.001). All but 1 all patients with SLN micro metastases ) demonstrated at least 1 previously described uterine pathology risk factor for lymphatic spre ad (grade 3 histology, outer half myometrial invasion or tumor size >2 cm). Conclusions: Micro metastases within SLNs appear to be associated with known uterine risk factors for nodal metastases. This supports the validity of metastatic disease identified in SLNs with ultrastaging techniques. The diseas e-specific outcomes of patients with low-volume disease have not yet been established. Translational/Clincal Research Post-Doctoral/Medical FellowPOSTER #120 CHANGES IN BODY COMPOSITION CORR ELATES WITH SURVIVAL IN PATIENT S WITH PANCREATIC ADENOCARCINOMA ON Zimmers3,4, Safi Shahda2 1 Indiana University School Of Medicine Department Of Surgery, Indianapolis, IN 2 Indiana University School Of Medicine Department Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 3 Indiana University School Of Medicine Department Of Surgery, Indiana University School Of Medicine Department Of Anatomy & Cell Biology, Indianapolis, IN 4 Indiana University Simon C ancer Center, Indianapolis, IN Email: joshkays@iupui.edu Introduction: Patients with malignancy often develop loss of skeletal muscle and/or fat, a process known as cachexia. Development of cachexia has been associated with decr eased response to therapy, decreased survival, and worse overall outcomes. Presence of cachexia is c ommon in patients with Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with up to 80% developing cachexia. This study evaluated the changes in body composition in patients with non- resectable PDAC on FOLFIRINOX therapy and the correlations of these changes with survival. Methods: This is a retrospective study of patients with PDAC being trea ted with FOLFIRINOX therapy at Indiana University H ospital between July 1, 2010 and August 31, 2015. Demographic and clinical data were collected on all patients including age, sex, disease extent, b est response to therapy, progression free survival, and overall survival. Lumbar skel etal muscle and fat masses wer e measured on serial computed tomography (CT) scans. Based on these measu rements patients were stratifie d into 3 groups; muscle/fat gainers, muscle and fat losers, a nd fat only losers. Results: Fifty-five (55) patients were ide ntified with available CT sca ns and survival data. Twenty-six (47.3%) presented with locally advanced (LA) disease compared to 29 (53.7%) presenting with metastatic (Met) disease. Twenty-nine (53.7%) of patients presented with s arcopenia compared t o 26 (47.3%) who did not have sarcopenia at diagnosis. There was no increased odds of sarcopenia present at diagnosis between LA and Met groups (OR=1.46; 95% CI=0.5033-4.2415). Survival analys is showed no significant difference between patients who presented w ith sarcopenia and those who di d not with median survival being 12.94 months vs. 17.77 months (p=0.375)(HR=1.303; 95% CI= 0.727-2.369 ). Forty-nine were divided into 3 groups; 25 (51.0%) were muscle and fat losers, 14 (28.6%) were fat only losers, and 10 (20.4%) were muscle/fat gainers . Median survival for muscle and fat losers was 12.94 months, for fat only losers was 14.48 months, and for muscle/fat gainers was 28.53 m onths. Comparison of survival for each group showed significant difference in o v e r a l l s u r v i v a l b e t w e e n m u s c l e and fat losers and muscle/fat gainers (p=0.018)(HR=2.98; 95% CI=1.22-6.12) and between fat gainers (p=0.006) (HR=3.62; 95% CI=1.62-11.31). Conclusion: Loss of skeletal muscle and/or f at in patients undergoing FOLF IRINOX therapy for non- resectable PDAC is associated with shorter median overall survi val and associated with a significant increased risk of all-cause mortality. Preventing loss of skeletal muscle and fat in patients with PDAC may confer a survival advantage. Further studies in which skeletal muscle and fat loss is prevented are needed to further understand the role of cachexia on mortality in PDAC. Translational/Clincal Research Post-Doctoral/Medical FellowPOSTER CHANGES Radiation Oncology, Indianapolis, Stereotactic radiation ther apy (SBRT) is used as an ablative therapy for liver tumors and is thought to cause atrophy of liver tissue in the treated segment. The hypo thesis is that the liver volume outside of the area treated by SBRT will grow to compensate.Materials/Methods: This retrospective analysis included 8 patients from one instit ution with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent antation between 2007-2012 and had follow-up CT scans at 3 and 6 months. Four patients had Child-Pugh Class (CPC) A cirrhosis and 4 had CPC B cirrhosis. The sum of the maximum tumor diameter ranged from 1.0-5.1 cm (1 patient had 2 lesions) . Two patients received 4800 cGy in 3 fractions and 6 received 4000 cG y in 5 fractions. At least 700 cm 3 of normal liver received <1500 cGy in all patients. Elapsed time between c ompletion of SBRT to liver tra nsplantion was 186-1220 days. The Phillips IntelliSpace Liver Analysis appl ication was used for Couinaud s of 3- and 6-month volume cm3-2430 cm3. The mean 3- and 6-month changes in total liver volume were -8.3 +/- 11.1% (range -26.0% to (range -35.8% to +4.04%). The mean 3- and 6-month changes in liver volume outside the treated segment were -6.4 +/- 10.5% (range +3.8%), respectiv ely. The mean 3- and 6-month change in liver volume in the treated segment was -8.0 +/- 23.2% (range respectively. Pathologic analysis did corroborate ablation of the treated segment. Six of 8 patients (75%) had a c omplete response and 2 had stable disease . The planning target volume (PTV) was >100 cm3 in 3 patients, all of whom received 4000 cGy in 5 fractions. The 2 patients with the largest changes in volume outside of th e treated segment at 6 months (-20.1% and -30.4%) had the largest PTVs (207.5 cm3 and 169.0 cm3, respectively) and had CPC B cirrhosis. Another patient with CPC A cirrhosis had a PTV of 169.0 cm3 and experienced a -4.6% decrease in liver volume outside the treated segment. The patient who had a -20.1% change in his liver volume had decompensated from a CPC B to CPC C at the time of liver transplantation and was the only patient who had a decline in CPC pre-transplant. Conclusions: Post-SBRT changes in liver volume are highly variable. In this cohort of HCC patients treated with SBRT who underwent subsequent liver transplantation, liver volume ou tside of the treated segment did not increase significantly at 6 months but r ather was stable to decreased. The use of functional imaging to guide planning for SBRT may help protect normal liver, allowing regeneration a nd/or avoiding deterioration of liver function, especially in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Further studie s are needed to confirm our findings. Translational/Clincal Research Post-Doctoral/Medical FellowPOSTER #122 ROLE OF STEREOTACTIC BODY RADIOTHERAPY AS A BRIDGE TO ORTHOTOPI C LIVER TRANSPLANTATION: EVALUATION OF PATHOLOGIC RESPONSE AND OUTCOMES MANNINA1, 1 ONCOLOGY, INDIANAPOLIS, IN 2 BIOSTATISTICS, INDIANAPOLIS, IN 3 RADIOLOGY, INDIANAPOLIS, IN 4 PATHOLOGY, INDIANAPOLIS, IN Email: EMANNINA@IUPUI.EDU Introduction Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is an emerging radiation treatment te chnology that utilizes high doses per fraction to deliver an ablative therapy to tumors. The te chnology is evolving with advances in treatment planning, image guidance and patient immobilization. The technique was applied to early stage, localized hepatocellular carcinoma with our institutional Phase I-II trial showing acceptable toxicities and exceptional rates of local control. The role of SBRT as a bridge to de finitive orthotopic liver transpla ntation (OLT) was analyzed herein. Materials & Methods The subjects of this retrospective repo rt are 38 patients with a diagno sis of hepatocellular carcinoma who received stereotactic body radiotherapy per our institutional Phase I- II eligibility criteria, en route to definitive OLT. Demographic and treatment variables of patients with Child-P ugh class (CPC) A-5 to B-7 cirr hosis were analyzed against local control (complete response + partia l response + stable disease), response rate (complete + partial response), overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) calcul ated from OLT. Pre-OLT radi ographs were compared with pathologic gold standard using several accepted radiographic scoring criteria fo r concordance, sensitivity, specificity and predictive values. An analysis of tr eatment failures and deaths was undertaken. Results With a median follow-up of 4.8 years fr om OLT, 9/38 patients (24%) developed recurrent disease while 10/38 patients (26%) died. Kaplan-Meier estimates of 3-year OS an d DFS are 77 and 74%, respectively. No survival differences were appreciated by CPC or pre-SBRT T stage. The sum long est dimension of tumors was si gnificantly associated with DFS (HR 1.93, p=0.026). Most common dose -fractionation schedules were x3 in CPC-A patients and 8Gy x5 in CPC-B patients. With a mean time from SBRT to OLT of 10.7 months, pathologic local cont rol was 100% in 44 evaluable lesions while pathologic response rate was 68%. At the time of transplant, mean 41% reduction in tumor size by CT or MRI was observed as was a mean 3-fold reduction in AFP le vel. Radiographic scoring crit eria performed poorly, with sensitivity (90%), predictive value (74%) and negative predictive value (40%). Ex plants revealed viable tumor in 79% of patients. 63% of patients maintained their CPC and 50% were assigned pathologic T stage concordant with clinical T stage. Trea tment failures had statistically larger sum longest dimension of tumors (4.0 cm vs 2. 8 cm, p=0.014) and a trend towards higher percentage of lymphovascular space invasion (44% vs. 17%, p=0.078). Conclusions SBRT as a bridge to OLT is a well-toler ated treatment providing 100% pathologic local control rates without a survival benefit, as all patients underwent definitive OLT, 79% having viable tumor. Ra diographic response criteria poorly approximate pathology. Factors worthy of investigat ion for further adjuvant therapy include sum longest tumor dimension and pathologic presence of lymphovascular space THE SUBCLASSIFICATION AND GENOTYPING OF NON- SMALL Houssam Oueini2,5, Khalil Diab2,5 1 Internal Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 2 Indiana University School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 3 Marion General Hospital, Indianapolis, IN 4 Indiana University Methodist Hospital, Indianapolis, IN 5 Pulmonary And Critical Care, Indianapolis, IN Email: samraad@iupui.edu Rationale: The current managemen t algorithm for locally advance d or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) incorporates testing for multiple genetic alterations, which in turn is used to guide treatment decisions. Emerging targeted age nts include kinase inhibitors o f epidermal growth fac tor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TB is increasingly used for the diagnosis and stagi ng of lung cancer. The purpose of this study is to examine the yield of EBUS- TBNA in the subclassification and genotyping of NSCLC. Materials and Methods: Sixty-nine patients at Indiana University Hospital with suspected or confirmed lung adenocarcinoma underwent EBUS-TBNA of lung masses or lymph node s using a 21-gauge OlympusTM needle. Samples were first rev iewed by a pathologist, and if s uspicious for NSCLC, were sent for different types of molecular testing based on the clinical scenario. At least 6 extra passes were placed in cell block. For Paradigm testing, 10 passes were sent. EGFR and KRAS testing we re performed using the FDA approved Therascreen RGQ PCR Kit. Testing for ALK rearrangement was don e using fluorescent in situ hybridization. In some cases, testing for these mutations in addition to ROS1, BRAF, and HER2 was done using the Paradigm Cancer Diagnostics test. Results: Sixty-nine samples from patients with NSCLC obtained b y EBUS-TBNA were sent for molecular testing for EGFR. Results were ob tained in all patients (yield = 100%). Mutations were found in 3 patients (4.3%) vs. 66 wild-type (95.7%) . 60 samples were sent for molecular testing for KRAS (yield = 100%), of which 10 had mutations (16.7%) vs. 50 wild-type (83.3%). 51 sa mples were sent for ROS1 testing [0 mutant, 48 (94.1%) wild-type]. Tissue sa mples were inadequate for testi ng in 3 patients (yield=94.1%). 64 samples were sent for ALK testing (3 (4.7%) mutant, 55 (85.9%) wild-typ e, yield = 90.6%). Ten samples were sent for BRAF testing and two samples were sent for HER2 testing, all of which were negative for mutations (yield = 100%). Conclusion: Tissue sampling obtained from EBUS-TBNA in routine practice is appropriate for molecular mutation analysis and subtyping of NSCLC. Clinical Implications: EBUS-TBNA with a 21-gauge needle is a po tentially useful tool for the subclassification and genotyping of NSCLC. Improving the yield of this technique is important as we start testing for a greater number of mutations.

Targeted therapies including Gemcitabine (GemzarTM), FOLFIRINOX (5-FU/leucovorin/ir inotecan/oxaliplatin), and sustai ned release, nab-paclitaxel (AbraxaneTM) offer modest improvement in survival, albeit at an increase i n side effects and unwanted toxicities. Data is presented on factors involved in panc reatic cancer cell survival signaling due to its redox-coactivator activity, such as HIF-1a , NFkB, NRF2 and STAT3. High expression levels of Ref-1 indicate decreased survival in PDAC as well as other cancers. APX3330 has been shown in multiple in vitro and in vivo pancreatic cancer models to be effective in reducing tumor growth and metastases as a single agent. The mechanism of action has been extensively investigated and characterized for its specific activity on Ref -1, as well as its preclinical PK/PD, ADME. The safety and dose administration of APX3330 have been established by Eisai pharmaceutical company through a pr evious development program including toxicology, phase I, and phase II clinical evaluation in non-cancer patients in Japa n. We have partnered with ApeX Therapeutics to develop APX3330 for cancer treatment (phase I t rial anticipated start date mid- 2016). While developing APX3330 for single agent use, we studied interactions of Ref-1, convergent pathways; HIF-1a and STAT3, and ets like CAIX. Initially, we performed in vivo studies demonstrating single and combination effects of APX333 0 with Gemcitabine (Gem) showing signif icantly decreased tumor volume in the APX3330 and Gem combination treatments compar ed to the single-agents alone. We also tested single and combination studies of APX3330 in an ex vivo 3-D tumor-stroma model system using patient derived tumor cells along with patient derived cancer-associate d fibroblasts (CAFs). JAK2 inhibitor, Ruxolitinib; both a gents in clinical trials. In our ex vivo 3D co-culture system, APX3330 de creases the tumor area and inte nsity in a dose-dependent manner. The combination of APX3330 with Gem demonstrated an add itive enhancement effect in the tumor. Blocking both Ref-1 redox-signaling activity with APX3330 and CAIX activity via SLC- 0111 demonstrated enhanced tumor killing in our models. APX3330 along with Ruxolitinib also demonstrated enhanced tumor killing. These data demonstrate APX3330 single agent efficacy in our 3D patient PDAC model and enhanced tumor killing when pathways regulated by Ref-1, HIF-1 and STAT3 are blocked. Additional drug combinations focused on pathways that are depen dent on Ref-1 signaling will also be presented.

Devel oping a better understanding of th e molecular mechan isms of therapeutic resistance is critical to help identify novel therapeutic strat egies that overcome metastasis, resistance, and death. We previously identif ied the transcripti on factor ZNF217 (human ) / Zfp217 (mouse) as a prognostic indicator for breast cancer patients. ZNF217 is over expressed in breast cancer and this overexpression promotes reduced s urvival, increased metastasis, and reduced response to therapy. We found that Zfp217 overexpression prom otes an increase in self-r enewal capacity, invasion, and metastasis as well as expansion of a progenitor cell population during both normal mammary development as well as durin g breast cancer progression. We next determined if Zfp217 ove rexpression in vivo contributed to chemotherapy resistance. We treated mice overexpressin g Zfp217 with a combination therapy that were treated with EAC developed a significant increase in tumor volume over control m ice within 21 days of EAC treatment. In addition, we find that chemothera py resistance after Zfp217 overexpression causes a n accumulation of a mammary gland progenitor ce ll population, which we hypothesiz e is the cell population resistant to standard treatments. To overcome breast cancer chem oresistance caused by ZNF217 over expression, we identified triciribine, a nucleoside anal og and AKT inhibitor, as a drug t hat kills cells that overexpress ZNF217. We found that triciribine treatment inhibited tumor burden in vivo in tumors that overexpressed Zfp217. Triciribine also had synergy wit h doxorubicin in cell death ass ays and in xenografts using human cell lines. Using our preclinical an imal models of Zfp217 overexpres sion, we elucidated the appropriate dosing for of triciribine and the microtubu le inhibitor paclitaxel to treat breast cancer and found that the order of treatment impacts the effica cy of therapy. We also tested the therapeutic efficacy in patient- derived tumor xenografts (PDX) of human tumors with high versus low levels of ZNF217 expression and similarly saw that treatment or ders matters for eff icacy. Our preclinical studies have influenced the desi gn of Phase II clinical trials using triciribine to treat metastatic breast cancer. Translational/Clincal Research Post-Doctoral/Medical PEDIATRIC ALLOGENEIC HEMATOPOIETIC CELL TRANSPLANTATI ON ARE ASSOCIATE D WITH INCREASE D CRITICAL CARE NEEDS AND 6-MONTH MORTALITY Alicia Teagarden1, Jodi Skiles2, Andrew Beardsley1, Michael Hobson1, Jamie Renbarger2 1 Department Of Pediatrics, Section Of Critical Care , Indiana University School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 2 Department Of Pediatrics, Section Of Hematology /Oncology, Indiana University School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN Email: agranos@iupui.edu Introduction: Poor nutritional status in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) patients is a negative prognostic factor. However, there are no pediatric studies evaluating albumin leve ls prior to HCT and need for critical care interventions. We aimed to determine if there is a relationshi p between serum albumin levels in the pre-HCT period, routinely measured 30 days (+ 10 days) prior to transpl ant, and need for critical care interventions. We hypothesized that pediatric patie nts with low albumin levels pr ior to undergoing allogeneic HCT will have a higher critical care needs in the post-transplant period. Methods: This is a 5-year retrospective st udy of pediatric patients who underwent allogeneic HCT for any reason. Patients were excluded if they received an autologous HCT, if m issing lab data prior to transplant, and any data from subsequent transplants. Primary outcome was critical care needs. Secondary outcome was 6-month mortality. Critical care needs we r e d e f i n e d a s : a d m i s s i o n t o t h e PICU, requiring noninvasive ventilation (CPAP or BiPAP), intubation re quiring mechanical ventilation, a nd need for vasoactive therapy. Patients were categorized based on albumin levels. Low albumin was defined as <3.1 g/dL. Continuous variables were compared using a Wilcoxon rank su m test. Categorical variables are expressed as percentages. Univariate analysis was completed with logistic regression. Results: A total of 73 pediatric HCT patie nts were included in the study with a median age of 7.4 years (IQR 3.3, 13.2). Patients with low albumin, defined as <3.1 g/dL, had a higher need for critica l PICU (56% vs 16%, p=0.01). These patients also had higher 6-month mortality of 56% vs 17%, p=0.02. Conclusions: Children who undergoing allogeneic HCT and have low serum a lbumin levels in the p re-transplant period are more likely to need critical c are interventions and have in creased 6-month mortality. These findings may identify an at-risk population in which nutritional improvement s may be instituted prior to HCT in hopes of improving outcomes. Translational/Clincal Research Post-Doctoral/Medical FellowPOSTER #127 OVARIAN CANCER VULNERABILITY TO H DAC INHIBITORS IS DEPENDENT UP ON Obstetrics & Gynecology, Indiana University School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 2 Obstetrics & Gynecology, Northwestern University School Of Medicine, Chicago, IL 3 Indiana University School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 4 Medical And Molecular Genetics, Indiana Univ ersity School Of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN Email: jathomes@iupui.edu Background : Histone acetylation regulates gene expression in cancer and can be exploited for therapeutic targeting. Histone deacetylase i nhibitors (HDACi) increase hist one acetylation, promoting transcription of genes involved in growth arrest and apoptosis and have been use d as anti-cancer agents. BRCA mutations are the best characterized genetic alteration associated with ovari an cancer and can be targeted therapeutically by recently approved PARP inhibitors. We hypothesized that the ep igenetic landscape of ovarian cancer is altered by the presenc e of BRCA mutations and can be manipulate d by HDACi for therapeutic benefit. Materials and Methods : We utilized isogenic cell lines carrying mutated/functional BRCA 1 (UWB1.289; UWB1.289-BRCA), and respectively BRCA 2 genes (PE01/PEO4). We measured HDAC expression and activity by western blotting and an enzymatic assay and characterized globally chromatin marked by H3K9ac (active chromatin) and H3K27ac (poised chromatin) by using ChIP sequencing. To determine whether HDAC inhibitors increase susceptibility to PARP inhibitors, cel l proliferation was measured in ovarian cancer cells expressing mutated and wild type (WT) BRCA. Results : HDAC1 expression and activity wer e decreased in cell lines ca rrying defective BRCA proteins. ChIP sequencing identified chromatin r egions differentially marked b y H3K9ac (178 promoters in BRCA1-null compared to BRCA WT cells) and H3K27ac (131 promoters in BRCA W T compared to BRCA null cells) suggesting differences in gene t ranscription dependent on histo ne acetylation in BRCA mutated vs BRCA functional cancer cells. A subset of genes differentially mark ed by H3K9ac were validated at mRNA level PCR and entinostat (MS-275) in creased H3K9ac was associated with an increase in TGM2, FLI1, DKK1 and E2F2, and a decrease in TWIST2 gene expression in both BRCA1-wt and -null cell lines confirming epigenetic regulation of this subset of genes. Functionally, HDACi synergized with PARP inhibitors i n BRCA null ovarian cancer cel ls (combination index 0.63), consistent with the altered gene expression changes induced by differences in c hromatin marks. Conclusions: In conclusion, the chromatin l andscape is altered in BRCA nul l ovarian cancer cells and can be targeted by HDAC inhibitors. Identifying pathways and specific genes altered by hist one acetylation may enable future rational targe ted combination Translational/Clincal Research Post-Doctoral/Medical FellowPOSTER #128 ROLE OF DICER HAPLOINSUFFICIE NCY Broaddus5 1 Department Of Obstetrics And Gynecology, School Of Medicine, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN 2 Department Of Obstetrics And Gynecology , Baylor College Of Medicine, Houston, TX 3 Department Of Molecular And Cellular Biolog y, Baylor College Of Medicine, Hoston, TX 4 Department Of Biochemistry, Baylor College Of Medicine, Houston, TX 5 MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX Email: xw49@iu.edu Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy, a ffecting 1 out of every 38 women in the United States. Activation of the PI3K pathway through lo ss or mutation of the tumor suppressor PTEN accounts for 80% of these tumors. Late-stage and recurrent disease carries poor 5-year survival. Decreased DICER expression is associated with poor prognosis endometrial cancers. DICER is the RNAse responsible for processing the ursor miRNA hairpin to generate 2 single-stranded mature miRNA forms, the complementary miRNA-5p and miRNA-3p forms. Published in vitro studies have shown that DICER+/- cells have a switch in production from the abundant miRNA-5p form to the miRNA-3p form. Based on our interests in DICER processing and miRNA function, we mined TCGA ( The Cancer Genome Atlas) rial ( PTEN in DICER (DICER +/-). Translationally important, gene signatures associated wit h PTENmutDICER+/- tumors showed significantly worse survival compared to PTENmut only (P=0.02). This is the first human tumor with DICER haploinsufficiency to show worse prognosis. Our analysis shows 164 mature miRNAs differentially expressed (fold change 1.25, P<0.05) between PTENmutDICER+/- genotype TCGA tumors. Examination a miRNA known to be dysregulated in DICER+/- cells in vitro , showed a specific dysregulation of let-7a-3p but not let-7a-5p. Integration with PTENmutDICER+/- gene signature showed enrichment of let-7a-3p targets, potentially targeting 181 genes out of 2441 genes in o ur PTENmutDICER+/- gene signature (Fisher's exact test, P=0.0002). To investigate the molecular mechanism of DICER haploinsufficiency in endometrial cancer, we created both in vivo (mouse) and in vitro (human endometrial cancer cell line) model systems of DICER haploinsufficiency. On a Pten deleted background, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed protection fr om loss of 2 alleles of Dicer and more aggressive endometrial cancer from loss of 1 allele of Dicer (P=0.005) compared to Pten cKO. Median survival for Dicer haploinsufficient mice was 150 days, 240 days for Pten cKO, and 315 days for double cKO. By 12 weeks, invasion through the myometri um occurred in 85% of cases for Dicer haploinsufficient tumors compared to 30% for Pten cKO. Additionally, Dicer haploinsuff icient tumors showed an increase in let-7a-3p expression. This is the first in vivo evidence in both mice and women that the miRNA-5p to miRNA-3p miRNA processing switch occurs with DICER haploinsufficiency, leading to s ignificant changes in gene expression and more aggressive tumors. In vitro , heterozygous deletion of DICER resulted in a 65% increase in cellular proliferation. In summary, our model systems will allow us to understand why loss of 1 allele of DICER leads to biologically aggressive endomet rial tumors and discover novel t herapeutic targets for aggressive endometrial cancers or other cancers that are DICER+/-.

Recently it was also approved to treat c-Kit - expressing gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Imatinib is extensively metabolized by CYP3A and CYP2C1 9 in the GI tract and liver, and the main metabolite, N-desmethyl imatinib, has comparable activ ity as its parent molecule. With consideration of brain metastasi s of stromal tumors, the brain concentration of imatinib should be estimated in relevance to its therapeutic efficacy. In addition , the drug-drug interaction should be also considered if co-medications CYP inhibitor or inducers . Thus predication of imatinib concentrations in tissues is important to estimate the dose of imatinib in order to achieve its best therapeutic efficacy and ensure th e safety profile. In this stu dy, we developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model (PBPK) mode l of imatinib to explore tissue distribution and CYP450- mediate drug-drug interactions. We collected relevant imatinib pharmacological da ta from literature and utilized the SIMCYP simulator (Certara) to predict imatinib concentrations in selected tissues. Initial tissue-to-plasma partiti on coefficients were predict ed using the Rodgers and Rowland method. Parameter estimation al gorithms within SIMCYP were the n utilized to adjust brain and liver partition coefficients for mouse to fit published data. T hese fitted values were then extrapolated to predict the pharmacokinetics of imatinib in human plasma and tissues. Human plasma concentration-time profiles from our prediction were comparable to literature reported observed values. Using the available CYP3A interacting drug models avai l a b l e i n S I M C Y P , w e h a v e a l s o predicted the effect of CYP3A inhibitors and inducers on the ph armacokinetics of imatinib. PBPK modeling is a useful tool to inve stigate effects of drug-drug i nteractions on plasma and exposure of imatinib. Translational/Clincal Research Research TechnicianPOSTER #130 MICRORNA-10B EXPRESSION IN A REA DILY ACCESSIBLE COMMON HEPATIC ARTERY LYMPH NODE CORRELATES WITH PANCREATIC CANCER RECURRENCE POST RESECTION Samantha Schmidt2, Michael House2 1 Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 2 Surgery, Indianapolis, IN 3 Biochemistry And Molecular Biology, Indianapolis, IN Email: samdeitz@iu.edu Pancreatic carcinomas (PC) account for more than 50,000 cancer- related deaths in the United States annually, with a 5-year survival of 7%-20% depending on the stage and tumor type. To date, the extent of peripancreatic lymph node involvement is the best prognostic factor for PC. However, detecting lymph node metastases is often limited to patients wh o are eligible for resection. While pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) remains the treatment of choice for potential cure, the majority of these cancers are non-resectable, due to advanced disease that is locally invasive and/or metastatic at presentation. Mor eover, early diagnosis of these carcinomas is hampered by the absence of non-invasive, sensitive, and specific biomarkers. We previously characterized microRNA (miR) expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and demonstrated that high miR- 10b levels in pancreatic cancer cells are associated with an at tenuated response to multimodality neoadjuvant therapy. We also showed that high miR-10b levels in the plasma of PDAC patients, determined by quantitative PCR (q- PCR), differentiated PDAC pat ients from normal controls. Thus, miR-10b may serve as a prognostic marker in PC. We therefore as sessed miR-10b levels in a common hepatic artery lymph node (station 8), which is readily accessible during PD and can be biopsied during diagnostic procedures. We also assessed plasma for several additional miRs that together with miR-10b comprise a panel that differentiates betw een PC and normal controls. Relative expression levels were used to assess for correlations with disease recurrence, recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). High miR-10b levels were observed in 14/30 patients with PC, and in 10 of these 14 patients, cancer recurred during the study period. By contrast, other miRs assessed from the panel were not significa ntly different when comparing patients with recurrent and non-r ecurrent disease. Furthermore, high miR-10b was associated with shorter RFS, but not OS. Elevated miR-10b levels in station 8 lymph nodes correlates with increased risk of cancer recurrence and could be used preoperat ively to assess risk for early disease progression in patients with pancreatic tumors. Translational/Clincal Research Research TechnicianPOSTER #131 CAMKK2 Li1, Khalid Mohammad2, Theresa Guise2 1 Anatomy And Cell Biology , Indianapolis, IN 2 Internal Medicine, Endocrinology And Metabolism , Indianapolis, IN Email: jw225@iupui.edu Approximately 180,000 men are dia gnosed with prostate cancer (P Ca) each year in the United States, making it the most common cancer among men second only to myeloma. Whe reas, patients with l ocalized PCa have a 5-year survival rate of 100%, th e survival rate drops to 31% in patients with distant metastases. In the initial stages, PCa cells are heavily reliant on androgens for growth. Hence, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is t h e f i r s t l i n e o f d e f e n s e a g a i n s t t h e d i s e a s e . H o w e v e r , A D T c o n tributes to weaker bone and predisposes patients to an increas ed risk of fragility f ractures resulting in significant medical cos ts, loss of productivity and loss of patient's quality of life . Prevention of such fractures will alleviate a great deal of suffering by the patient and his family. Bone rem odeling is characterized by the coupling of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and osteoblast-mediated new bone formation. Imbalanc es in this process, wherein resorption outpaces synthesis, result in pathological conditions such as o steoporosis. Established anti-resorptive therapies slow the loss of bone, but do not hing to promote bone growth. A nabolic therapies are vastly underdeveloped and form the greatest clinical n eed in treatment of ADT-associated osteoporosis. We recently identified Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent prote i n k i n a s e k i n a s e 2 ( C a M K K 2 ) t o have roles in the anabolic and catabolic pathways of bone remodeling, such that inhibition of CaMKK2 positively affects osteoblasts and negatively affects osteo age-associated bone loss in mice. While CaMKK2 is not expressed in normal prostate tissue, it is highly over-expressed in PCa. CaMKK2 is regulated by the androg en receptor (AR) and its inhib ition suppresses the growth and migration of PCa cells in vitro. However, t he exact downstream mechanism by which CaMKK2 regulates PCa growth and/or migration remains unknown. Based on these studies, we hypothesized that inhibiting CaMKK2 will prevent ADT-induced bone loss a nd alleviate bone metastatic tumor burden.To test this hypothesis, we p e r f o r m e d e i t h e r b i l a t e r a l o r c h i e c t o m y ( O R X ) o r s h a m s u r g e r y o n 4-week old mice, and injected approximately 200,000 C4-2B cells into the proximal right tibia of all mice two weeks following surgery. The mice were divided into 4 groups: (a) sham/saline (n=15), (b) sh am/STO-609 (n=15), (i.p.) injections of saline or STO-609 (10 \u00b5mol/kg mouse body weight) be gan one week prior to the surgeries and continued for the duration of the study (12 weeks). Tumor progression was monitored through biweekly radiographic analysis. Right and left proximal tibia micro computed tomography, inhibition of CaMKK2 was able to prevent ORX-induced bone loss and lessen bone metastatic tumor burden in nude mice.
