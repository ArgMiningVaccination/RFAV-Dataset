How do you know if you are experiencing a vestibular disorder and could benefit from balance therapy? Common symptoms include: - Dizziness and/or vertigo Vertigo is the distorted sense that you or your surroundings are spinning or whirling. Dizziness is a more general term that includes vertigo, but may also describe feeling lightheaded, unsteady or \"woozy.\" - Gaze instability Gaze instability is sometimes called visual blurring. It occurs when head and eye movements are out of sync and results in an inability to focus on objects. Patients frequently first notice the issue when walking or running. - Imbalance and/or falls Imbalance includes difficulty staying upright or navigating while walking and can be particularly dangerous when it leads to falls and potential injury. Other symptoms that may indicate or accompany balance problems include: - Headaches - Nausea or vomiting - Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) or hearing loss - Inability to concentrate - Fatigue Sierra Nevada ENT specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of balance disorders at our Center for Vestibular Rehabilitation. If you are experiencing new or worsening symptoms, particularly if they interfere with your ability to function on a daily basis, contact us today. What is Balance Therapy? Balance therapy consists of physical exercises to alleviate symptoms associated with vestibular disorders, allowing patients to reduce and even eliminate dizziness, vertigo, gaze instability, imbalance and falls. Exercises generally fall into one of three categories. - Habituation Habituation aims to decrease the severity of a response through repeated exposure to the problematic stimuli. It works best with patients who experience dizziness or instability in conjunction with movements, such as turning their head quickly or looking up. - Gaze stabilization Gaze stabilization exercises are specific, repeated movements of the head while viewing objects set against different backgrounds. It is generally recommended for those who experience visual blurring, difficulty focusing, and/or dizziness with movement such as walking. - Balance training Balance training involves exercises to strengthen posture and body mechanics when standing still and while moving in a controlled environment in order to reduce the risk of falling and improve safety with daily activities. Any patient experiencing instability with daily activities will benefit from this approach. Physical therapy for balance teaches both your body and brain to compensate for the disruption to your sensory system. While each balance therapy method targets a different issue, all involve consistent exposure and movements that build upon one another gradually in a safe and professional setting. At the Center for Vestibular Rehabilitation, our experts tailor each vestibular therapy program to an individual patient's specific needs, helping them reduce symptoms and return to normal daily function. Vestibular Disorders That Benefit From Balance Therapy There is no single cause of vestibular disorders. They may be the result of infection or disease, injury, age or medication. Sometimes, there is no obvious underlying source. While it is not always possible to diagnose the cause of balance problems, it IS possible to treat the symptoms. Almost all vestibular disorders can benefit from balance therapy. Issues that are often referred to vestibular therapy include, but are not limited to: - Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) - Labyrinthitis neuritis - - Vestibular migraine - Cervical vertigo (cervicogenic dizziness) - Stroke, traumatic brain injury or persistent concussion symptoms (PCS) Balance problems can be sustained or episodic in nature and are often highly disruptive to daily functions. As a result, individuals suffering from balance problems may cease normal activities and experience anxiety, depression, or other physical or mental health issues. This can have profound social and economic ramifications. If you have been diagnosed with a vestibular condition, it is time to see an ear, nose and throat doctor to determine what form of physical therapy for balance may be right for you.
