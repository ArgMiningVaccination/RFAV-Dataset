If you are counting on acupuncture and herbs to help you through seasonal allergies, it's better to start sooner vs. later. Getting your treatments in before the symptoms start will either prevent them or give you a milder version of whatever you typically experience (congestion, sneezing, itchy eyes, etc.). I hope you all are making progress in the Vaccine Gladiator Games a.k.a. [finding an appointment](https://www.macovidvaccines.com/). Thanks to the wonderful folks at the [Greater Lawrence Family Health Center](https://l.instagram.com/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fglfhc.org%2F&e=ATND2_6GTeh2QJeI_wmreIyt7u1bteawmmCpB9EtlfiMq11WSS_VmxqBIcIcsoxD1rBvU0oY05PdMVagsX67twdGKKfIvFeoJSp5lQ&s=1), I was able to get both doses of my COVID-19 vaccine by February 4. I am beyond grateful to be able to feel safer about coming to work. Does this change anything here at the clinic? The short answer is NO. [Pandemic safety protocols](https://www.flyingturtlehealingarts.com/pandemic-safety-protocols/) like mask-wearing and hand washing will stay in place, since vaccinations do not prevent infection and transmission. (Here's a [good video on how vaccines work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOvvyqJ-vwo&vl=en) and [why you can't compare vaccine efficacy](https://youtu.be/K3odScka55A).) We will also continue to follow [CDC travel guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/after-travel-precautions.html) for those who travel or otherwise step outside of their social pods/bubbles and see family/friends whom they are not in regular contact with. Please take note that the guidelines have changed in recent months: [Get tested 3-5 days after travel AND stay home and self-quarantine for a full 7 days after travel](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/testing-air-travel.html). Even if you test negative, stay home and self-quarantine for the full 7 days. - If you don't get tested, stay home and self-quarantine for 10 days after travel. I understand that herd immunity can only be achieved when vaccination rates go above 80% ( [MA is currently only 19% fully vaccinated](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/01/28/960901166/how-is-the-covid-19-vaccination-campaign-going-in-your-state)), so please encourage everyone you know to get the vaccine. In the meantime, stay safe and masked. I look forward to seeing your (still half-covered) faces soon! Be well, Fannie Update on services, rates and schedule Since reopening the clinic last June, there have been a number of changes implemented as part of safety protocols that were supposed to be temporary but will now have to be adopted long-term. For instance, capacity was reduced in order to allow the treatment rooms to air out for 30 minutes in between patients. 15-minute free consults became virtual/phone-based. Full (50-minute) Trigger Point Dry Needling sessions are no longer offered because of the prolonged exposure time between the patient and me. (Instead, patients have been transitioned to \"Acupuncture+ sessions\" that incorporate dry needling or electroacupuncture, which have been quite effective.) Due to the additional safety measures, cleaning procedures, and reduced capacity, it has become necessary to increase service rates by $5, effective April 1st. (Insurance patients will not be affected.) Thank you all for understanding. The schedule has been relatively full for the past few weeks, so if you urgently need an appointment, let me know via [book online](https://www.flyingturtlehealingarts.com/new-patients/#schedule) 1-2 weeks out instead of waiting until the last minute. It is easy to reschedule through a link in appointment confirmation email.
