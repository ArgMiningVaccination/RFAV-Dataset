ABOUT CDAA (CoLymph Detox Acupuncture Association) The CoLymph Detox Acupuncture treatment method is a novel and unique approach to health, pain management, and disease prevention that finds and treats the root causes of symptoms and illness by targeting two organ systems that dictate a large part of our health\u2014the Colon and the Lymphatic System. This specialized treatment method was developed by Dr. Thomas Seo based on scientific data and his 20+ years of clinical experience and research. The CoLymph method embodies integrative medicine practices by combining scientific research/evidence with holistic acupuncture treatment, herbal medicines, and functional dietary therapy with comprehensive and personalized food consultations to aid your body in healing from within. Our focus on gut & lymphatic health puts immense importance on one's diet for your overall health, as backed by research and using food as medicine. The CDA method looks at food in a completely new light by going beyond cookie-cutter nutrition advice and utilizing the nature and action of each ingredient for reduced inflammation and true whole-body wellness. Using these multiple modalities is aimed at rebalancing and restoring the normal functions of the colon/GI system and lymphatic system to help reduce systemic inflammation and its downstream long-term effects.
