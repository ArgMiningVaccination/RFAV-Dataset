In turn, standardized plant extract is even more expensive. 5) 100% pure plant product, without additives, excipients or chemicals: most manufacturers fill capsules with only 250 mg of plant extract, and the remaining 250 mg of 500 mg is filled with regular powder from plants, chemicals, and other flours to reduce costs. 6) Extensive laboratory testing: All Planet Ayurveda supplements have been thoroughly tested in an EU accredited laboratory.
