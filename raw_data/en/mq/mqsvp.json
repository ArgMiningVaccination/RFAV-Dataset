Cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors are G protein-coupled receptors present from the early stages of gestation, which is involved in various physiological processes, including appetite, pain-sensation, mood, and memory. Due to the lipophilic nature of cannabinoids, it was initially thought that these compounds exert several biological effects by disrupting the cell membrane nonspecifically. Recent biochemical and behavioral findings have demonstrated that blockade of CB1 receptors engenders antidepressant-like neurochemical changes (increases in extracellular levels of monoamines in cortical but not subcortical brain regions) and behavioral effects consistent with antidepressant/antistress activity. We aim to define various roles of cannabinoid receptors in modulating signaling pathways and association with several pathophysiological conditions.Institute for Research and Dyah AryaniSatibi, SatibiFINDRISCDiabetes MellitusReliabilityValidityClinical PharmacyDiabetes mellitus (DM) has developed as a major public health problem in the world.

Therefore, M. fragrans flesh can be developed for functional drinks which are sources rich in antioxidants good for the prevention and treatment of diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases. However, the tannins' content can cause a bitter and sour taste. Therefore, the tannins content should be reduced by the addition of egg white. The purpose of this study is to find out the comparison of antioxidant activity between a combination of M. fragrans flesh extract with various concentrations of egg white and to correlate its antioxidant activities with tannin, total flavonoid, and total phenolic contents. The antioxidant activities were conducted on M. fragrans flesh extract by using DPPH and ABTS radicals. Tannin, total flavonoid, and total phenolic contents from M. fragrans flesh extract were also tested. The M. fragrans flesh extracts without addition egg white have a strong antioxidant in scavenging the stable free radical ABTS (89.980\u00b10.480 \u00b5g/mL) and intermediate in scavenging the stable free radical DPPH (105.669\u00b10.102 \u00b5g/mL). It is followed accordingly by tannin, total flavonoid, and total phenolic contents, namely 14.034\u00b10.100 %w/w TAE, 26.929\u00b10.129 %w/w QE, and 53.164\u00b10.129 %w/w GAE, respectively. Correlation of tannin, total flavonoid, and total phenolic contents, which inhibited DPPH and ABTS radicals had R2 values of about 89.23-97.63%. It showed that antioxidant activity is strongly influenced by the tannin, total flavonoid, and total phenolic contents. Therefore, precipitation from the tannin-protein bond caused antioxidant activities were decreased.Institute for Research studyCoronaviruses cause some severe forms of respiratory infections such as Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). These viruses cause diarrhea in pigs and cows and upper respiratory disease in chickens, while other symptoms may differ. In humans, a total of six coronaviruses have been identified HCoVs-NL63, HCoVs-OC43, HCoVs-229E, HCoVs-HKU1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV. The world health organization (WHO) has done a great deal of hard work regarding combating the monstrous effects of this virus. So far, no specific antiviral drugs have been developed for the treatment of Covid-19. Therefore, the medicinal plants used for the previous epidemic outbreaks are getting attention for their potential treatment against the virus. It has been reported that 70 to 80% of people in developing countries depend on medicinal plants or phytomedicine compared to allopathic drugs for their primary healthcare. The south Asian subcontinents have used almost up to 25,000 formulations and extracts obtained from medicinal plants for treatment in folk medicine. The present review discusses an overview of the coronavirus, its immune responses, and some immunity-boosting herbs to combat Covid-19.Institute for Research and Muhammadiyah Laloai:journal.umpr.ac.id:article/25442022-02-15T08:20:08Zbjop:Nat-Pro-DevCompressional and Moringa oleifera have been widely reported to manage hypertension. Investigation of its pharmacological actions justifies its use. As part of formulation studies to standardize them, this study focused on their compaction and compression properties. Compacts equivalent to 250 mg of A. paniculata and M. oleifera were produced by compressing powders and granules at various compression pressure. Results show that M. oleifera met the WHO limit for ash values. Relative density values for granulated batches were higher, while their moisture content values were lower when compared to those of direct compression. The result from Heckel plots shows that batches deform mainly by plastic flow. For Kawakita plots, values of 1/b show that batches containing microcrystalline cellulose were less cohesive. The plot of tensile strength signifies that granulated batches achieved maximum crushing strength faster at low pressure. Formulations containing maize starch were shown to have higher percent porosity, and granulated batches gave higher values for apparent density-pressure relationship and lower friability values. Tablets produced by the wet granulation method showed better compression and compaction properties than those formulated by direct compression.Institute for Research and Community Services Universitas Muhammadiyah novel microbial species and the re-emergence of genetic variants of hitherto known microbes, the global healthcare system, and human health has been thrown into jeopardy. Also, certain microbes that possess the ability to develop multi-drug resistance (MDR) have limited the treatment options in cases of serious infections, and increased hospital and treatment costs, and associated morbidity and mortality. The recent discovery of the novel Coronavirus (n-CoV), the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that is causing the CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19) has resulted in severe morbidity and mortality throughout the world affecting normal human lives. The major concern with the current pandemic is the non-availability of specific drugs and an incomplete understanding of the pathobiology of the virus. It is therefore important for pharmaceutical establishments to envisage the discovery of therapeutic interventions and potential vaccines against the novel and MDR microbes. Therefore, this review is attempted to update and explore the current perspectives in microbes, clinical research, drug discovery, and vaccine development to effectively combat the emerging novel and re-emerging genetic variants of microbes.Institute for Research the best formulation for the peel-off mask Arachi or peanut (Arachis hypogaea L).

The study aimed to identify the co-amorphous formation between candesartan cilexetil (CAN) and l-arginine (ARG) and to know its effect on the solubility and dissolution rate of candesartan cilexetil. Initial prediction of co-crystal formation was undertaken by observing differences in crystal morphology between the candesartan cilexetil-l-arginine (CAN-ARG) mixture and each of its initial components due to crystallization in ethanol. The CAN-ARG co-amorphous was produced by the liquid-assisted grinding (LAG) method with the same molar ratio of the CAN and ARG mixture using ethanol as solvent. The co-amorphous formation of CAN-ARG was identified by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) methods. The solubility and dissolution test was performed to know the impact of the co-amorphous CAN-ARG formation. The PXRD pattern of CAN-ARG of LAG result showed a very low peak intensity compared to pure CAN and ARG. The DSC thermogram of the CAN-ARG LAG result does not show any sharp endothermic peaks. The PXRD and DSC results reveal that CAN and ARG can form co-amorphous. The solubility and dissolution rate of candesartan cilexetil in co-amorphous CAN-ARG was better than that of pure CAN. It can be concluded, liquid-assisted grinding of CAN-ARG mixture is identified to form co-amorphous which has an impact on increasing the solubility and dissolution rate of candesartan cilexetil.Institute for Research on EndangRumiyati, RumiyatiFadri, AlfatMarwati, MarwatiCancerCytotoxicGC-MSMCF-7HeLaCancer is a condition of abnormal cell proliferation of tissue cells in the body that becomes malignant.

Twenty-five Wistar rats were divided into five groups (n=5). Group 1 was administered 0.9% normal saline (negative control), group 2 was administered 150 mg/kg diclofenac sodium (positive control), and groups 3 to 5 were administered 50, 300, and 550 mg/kg BW of L. sarmentosa extract, respectively. Carrageenan was injected subcutaneously into each rat's subplantar region of the left hind paw. The paw volume was measured using a plethysmometer. The results showed that the water extract of L. sarmentosa stem (doses of 50, 300, and 550 mg/kg BW) significantly reduced the paw edema volume from the 4th to 5th hour compared to the negative control. The percent inhibition of edema at the 5th hour is 47.45; 46.95; 50.39%. The first phase of the edema (1st and 2nd hour) was not affected by the extract. Meanwhile, diclofenac sodium decreased paw edema volume from the 1st to 5th hour with a percent inhibition of 95.90% at the 5th hour. The histopathology result is relevant to the percentage inhibition of edema. Treatment with L. sarmentosa extract showed slight improvement, destruction of epidermal tissue, hyperkeratotic skin, and subepidermal edema. Meanwhile, positive control showed no inflammatory signs with normal keratin, subepidermal, and subcutaneous layers. The water extract of L. sarmentosa stem has anti-inflammatory activity. This extract effectively reduces the paw edema volume in the late phase with decreased neutrophil infiltration.Institute for Research and of 70% Ethanol Extract is widely used in Kalimantan to relieve pains, rheumatism, boost the immune system, and fever. The research on the free radical scavenging and analgesic effect of the L. sarmentosa stem extract has not been reported. This study aimed to evaluate the free radical scavenging and analgesic activity of the ethanol extract of L. sarmentosa. The L. sarmentosa stem was extracted using 70% ethanol and tested for free radical scavenging using the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) and analgesic activity, acetic acid-induced writhing test, and hot plate test in an animal model. The results showed that the 70% ethanol extract of the L. sarmentosa had an anti-free radical scavenging and analgesic activity. The extract has weak free radical scavenging with an IC50 value of 293.45 \u00b5g/mL. Analgesic activity using the writhing test indicated that the extract significantly reduced the writhes count after oral administration in a dose-dependent manner compared to the negative control. Extract at a dose of 550 mg/kg BW can reduce the writhing test by 67.60% compared to others. In contrast, the diclofenac sodium reduced the number of writhes by 74.74%. While in a hot plate, the extract at a dose of 550 mg/kg BW produced a maximum possible analgesia (MPA) of 17.64%, lower than the MPA of diclofenac sodium (51.01%). Analgesic activity of the extract has higher inhibition on the writhing test than on the hot plate. The extract could be responsible for the peripheral mechanism by inhibiting the prostaglandin biosynthesis.Institute for Research and Community Influenza's Symptoms Drug Search Terms in Indonesian-Language using Google Trends in the Covid-19 PandemicSyifa', NailisPurborini, NurulCovid-19Google trendInfluenza's symptoms drugIndonesiaSearching trendCovid-19 has spread globally and causes severe acute respiratory syndrome.
