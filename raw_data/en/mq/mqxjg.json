Browsing: COVID-19 A new combination COVID-19 vaccine improved protection against breakthrough infections in mice, according to a recent Northwestern Medicine study. In collaboration with Northwestern Medicine investigators, an international multi-center study has identified genetic factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. Inhibiting a specific protein complex in SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, may be a promising therapeutic target for treating the disease, according to a Northwestern Medicine study. The Northwestern Medicine Comprehensive COVID-19 Center is committed to caring for and conducting research on behalf of patients who experience long-term complications from COVID-19. Casey Benzaken, a second-year dual degree MD/MPH student, is studying the attitudes towards flu vaccines of Northwestern University undergraduates. Members of the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine community have been stepping forward to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Watch videos with three members of Feinberg labs who detail why they chose to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Northwestern Medicine investigators continue to assess COVID-19 treatments for mild to severe cases, the widespread adoption of telemedicine, and why a \"return to normal\" will be a missed opportunity to improve healthcare. Pregnant women who are diagnosed with COVID-19 have a higher risk of severe maternal morbidity and mortality and neonatal complications compared to pregnant women without COVID-19, according to recent findings. Vaccination against COVID-19 can help protect individuals, communities and facilitate a return to normal life, according to a "}
