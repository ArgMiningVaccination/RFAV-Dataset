It is guided predominately by the principle of vis medicatrix naturae - the healing power of nature. In essence, the body has the inherent ability to heal itself. This ability sometimes needs assistance and support due to daily stresses and environmental exposures. Naturopaths are primary care physicians who have received undergraduate degrees before they have completed four years in Naturopathic medical school. Similar to medical doctors, Naturopaths obtain a strong foundation in the sciences of anatomy, physiology, biochemistry and pharmacology training. The difference between the two professions lies predominantly in philosophic approaches and modalities employed to treat patients. Strengths unique to Naturopaths are comprehensive training in nutritional education, diet/lifestyle counseling, botanical medicine, homeopathy and other natural modalities. Our treatment modalities are chosen to support your natural healing processes. Educating the patient on ways to modify diet and lifestyle are equally important to Naturopaths. This preventative medicine lays the path toward long-term, functional health. Identification and treatment of the underlying root cause of the disease, or dys-ease (the absence of comfort), is needed before the body can begin the innate process of healing. We palliate symptoms when necessary. However, focusing on palliation exclusively can force the disharmony deeper into the body, causing further pathology. Symptoms are the story of a disease process. By reading them clearly and within context, we can begin treatment of the original disharmony, which slows or halts the progression of the disease and down stream symptoms. We are guided by these six principles: Vis medicatrix naturae \"The healing power is Cure\" Who We Treat At Flow Natural Health Care LLC we treat people, not their diseases.
