To find a COVID-19 vaccine for your child, contact your child's pediatrician or check community vaccination sites. You can also search [vaccines.gov](https://www.vaccines.gov/) to find a COVID-19 vaccine near you. See our COVID-19 vaccine FAQs below for information about vaccinating your child. - Is the COVID-19 vaccine safe for children? Yes, the COVID-19 vaccine had to meet high standards for safety and effectiveness to be authorized by the FDA for use in children. Since they were approved, COVID-19 vaccines have been given safely to hundreds of millions of people. Data shows they are safe and highly effective at preventing illness. The FDA will continue to monitor use of the COVID-19 vaccine to ensure its safety. - How effective is the COVID-19 vaccine in children? COVID-19 vaccines have shown to reduce the risk of COVID-19, including the risk of serious illness and hospitalizations. In clinical trials for children ages 5-11, the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine was 90.7% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19. Among 12-18 year-olds, the Pfizer vaccine has been 93% effective at preventing hospitalizations. Unvaccinated adolescents are 10x more likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19 than their vaccinated peers. Experts will continue to monitor the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines over time, especially as new variants emerge. For the most protection, it is important to stay up to date on your vaccines, including getting a COVID-19 booster if eligible. - Why should I vaccinate my child for COVID-19 if their risk of serious illness is low? While the risk of severe COVID-19 in children is lower compared to adults, that risk is not zero. Highly contagious variants have shown that children can and do get sick from COVID-19. In addition to protecting their health, vaccinating children is key to protecting others. - As of June 2022, more than 13.5 million cases of COVID-19 in children have been reported in the U.S. - During the Omicron surge, the rate of new COVID-19 hospitalizations in children reached a record-high. COVID19 hospitalizations in children ages 5-11 were twice as high for children who were not vaccinated as opposed to children who were vaccinated. - Children with even mild symptoms may be at risk for rare long-term side effects. As of June 2022, more than 8,500 children have been diagnosed with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) after COVID-19.

The COVID-19 vaccines for children are the same vaccines as for teens and adults, but they are given in a smaller dose. This smaller dose is due to the development of a child's immune system, not based on a child's size or weight. - Will my child experience any side effects from the COVID-19 vaccine? Your child may experience some side effects after getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Side effects are typically mild and are normal signs that the vaccine is building protection against COVID-19. Possible COVID-19 vaccine side effects in children include: - Pain, redness or swelling at the injection site - Tiredness - Headache - Muscle pain - Chills - Fever - Nausea Contact your child's health care provider if: - The redness or pain at the injection site gets worse after 24 hours - Their side effects are worrying you or do not go away after a few days Seek immediate medical attention if your child shows signs of a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine, such as rapid heartbeat, swelling of the throat, rash or hives. This reaction is extremely rare. - Could there be any long-term effects of the COVID-19 vaccine for children? There is no evidence of any long-term effects of the COVID-19 vaccine in children. The COVID-19 vaccines have been safely given to millions of children. The FDA required the COVID-19 vaccine be studied for at least 8 weeks after the final dose to ensure its safety, and the vaccine will continue to undergo intense safety monitoring. - Does the COVID-19 vaccine cause heart problems? One side effect that parents may have heard about is the chance of heart inflammation, or myocarditis. This is very rare and cases have been mild. People are more likely to experience myocarditis after COVID-19 illness than vaccination.

Yes, the COVID-19 vaccine is safe and recommended for children with chronic or underlying medical conditions. Children with certain health conditions may be at increased risk for severe COVID-19 illness, and therefore, vaccination is important to keeping them healthy. If your child has a compromised immune system, they may need to get additional doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. [See CDC recommendations here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html). - Should my child get vaccinated if they've already had COVID19? Your child should get the COVID-19 vaccine even if they already had COVID-19. Studies have shown that the vaccines can trigger a COVID-19 immune response stronger than the one naturally present in people who had COVID-19. Getting vaccinated can help prevent re-infection and illness. - Will my child need a COVID-19 booster shot or a shot annually? Booster shots are currently available and [recommended by the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0818-covid-19-booster-shots.html)for individuals ages 5 and older. Experts will continue to monitor vaccine efficacy to determine if younger children will need a booster shot in the future. - Can my child get the COVID-19 vaccine at the same time as other vaccines?
