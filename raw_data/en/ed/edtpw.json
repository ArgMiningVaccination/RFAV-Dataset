Bernard Machen In more than a decade as president of the University of Florida, Bernie Machen has grown and enhanced the university while putting it on a path to rise among the best public universities in the nation. President Machen has expanded UF's research operation, elevated its educational programs and increased access for students from a diversity of economic backgrounds. He has bolstered the university's commitment to innovation, grown its endowment, and led a noted universitywide sustainability initiative. Additionally, in 2013, President Machen launched UF on the nearly $1 billion UF Preeminence Plan to rise among the nation's top public universities. As part of that plan, the university is hiring an estimated 120 new faculty members, with 40 hires already completed by summer 2014. The new faculty members, most of whom are at the midcareer level, are expected to help advance UF research in 26 areas of promise. The Preeminence Plan is supported by $150 million in combined state-university dollars and an $800-million fundraising campaign. Milestones of President Machen's tenure include: Growth in annual research funding from $470 million in 2003-04 to $641 million in fiscal +year 2013. More than 3.1 million square feet in new construction on campus, including more than 628,000 square feet of new research space. Completion of UF's $1.7 billion capital campaign in 2012, at the time the sixth-largest public university campaign in history. The Machen Florida Opportunity Scholars program, enabling the enrollment of more than 2,900 first-generation college students, with about 1,500 graduates so far. Development of the 40-acre public private partnership known as Innovation Square and the Innovation Hub technology incubator now housing more than two dozen spinoffs. Creation of the Bob Graham Center for Public Service, Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center, the UF Water Institute and other key university institutes and centers. President Machen also significantly strengthened UF's hospital and health science research operations, bringing together the UF Health Science Center and Shands Hospital under UF Health. He has added several major new medical research and care facilities, including the Biomedical Sciences Building, the Clinical and Translational Research Building and the UF Health Cancer Center. And he launched UF's first major medical research facility outside Gainesville, the UF Research and Academic Center at Lake Nona's Medical City near Orlando. His educational enhancements include the spring- summer Innovation Academy for entrepreneurially-minded undergraduates; \"What is The Good Life?\", the first of an anticipated four core classes forming a signature undergraduate curriculum; and the launch and growth of UF Online, one of the first programs in the nation to offer four-year fully online undergraduate degrees. Prior to his arrival at UF , President Machen served for six years as president of the University of Utah, where he is credited with expanding the university's health sciences program, stabilizing the university's finances and bolstering diversity. From 1995 to 1997, he was provost and executive vice president for academic affairs at the University of Michigan, and from 1989 until 1995, he served as dean of Michigan's School of Dentistry. From 1983 to 1989, he was professor and associate dean at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill's School of Dentistry. President Machen is a past president of the American Association of Dental Schools. He also served as a member of the board of trustees of the Salt Lake Olympic Organizing Committee. His additional positions in national higher education leadership include serving as a member of the National Security Higher Education Advisory Board; chairing the board of directors of the National Campus Compact and serving as president of the executive committee of the Southeastern Conference and chair of the Southeastern Conference Academic Consortium. A native of Greenwood, Miss., President Machen grew up in St. Louis.

Today, as president and CEO of BAE Systems Inc., she has been recognized as an innovator and trailblazer, one of Fortune Magazine's 50 Most Powerful Woman in Business, and the British media dubbed her the \"first lady of defense.\" After college, Ms. Hudson began her career in the defense industry at the Harris Corporation and Ford Aerospace. Through impressive work and dedication, she soon rose through the ranks. She became president of armament and technical products at General Dynamics. Hudson later became president of BAE Systems' Land & Armaments, the world's largest military vehicle and equipment business. In 2009, she was named CEO of BAE Systems Inc., leading more than 40,000 employees and almost $13 billion in revenue. Her success has been documented in stories published in the Washington Post, New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Forbes. Washington Magazine named her one of Washington's 100 Most Powerful Women. She has been inducted in numerous halls of fame including the Washington Business Hall of Fame and the Industrial Systems and Engineering Hall of Fame. She has been honored as a Distinguished Alumna at UF and holds an honorary doctorate from Worcester Polytechnic Institute.Even with the demands such a successful career entails, Ms. Hudson finds time to give back to her alma mater, mentoring and providing career advice to engineering students. She emphasizes in her lessons the tools that led her on her own soaring career path: dedication, persistence and a work-life balance. She also serves as a UF Foundation executive committee member, is a member of the College of Engineering advisory board and remains active in UF's alumni and athletic associations. Celebrating her tremendous success and generosity to her alma mater, the university recognizes Ms. Hudson with an honorary doctorate of science degree. 11 2014 FALL Commen CementCommencement Speaker Gareth Schmeling Gareth Schmeling's work can best be thought of as archaeology through words. His major research project is a commentary on Satyrica of Petronius. Although it is a novel, the Latin work is regularly treated as a document of social history. Using his expansive knowledge of language, Dr. Schmeling deciphered and provided an interpretation of the work that has helped researchers better understand society and culture during Roman times. In his career at the University of Virginia and the University of Florida, he has taught beginning and advanced Greek and Latin as well as graduate courses on the Greek novelists, Petronius, Apuleius, Tacitus, and Lucian. He also taught large lecture courses in translation, mythology, the ancient novel, the Glory That was Greece, the Grandeur That was Rome and Masterpieces of Western Civilization. Dr. Schmeling holds a bachelor's degree from Northwestern College and a master's and doctorate from the University of Wisconsin. He came to UF in 1970 as an associate professor. His first book, \"Cornelius Nepos: Lives of Famous Men,\" was published in 1971. He has since published nine books, 46 academic articles, 41 book reviews and 81 papers. During his time at UF, Dr. Schmeling advanced quickly from an associate professor to chair of Classics and Humanities. He also has served as acting chair for the Department of Philosophy. He was later appointed a distinguished professor of classics and in 2005 received emeritus status. In 2010, Dr. Schmeling also began work at Johns Hopkins University as a visiting professor of classics and is now a fellow-by-courtesy. Dr. Schmeling has served in numerous professional societies, including secretary-treasurer and later president of the Classical Association of the Middle West and South, and vice president, trustee and trustee emeritus of the Society of Fellows at the American Academy in Rome. Dr. Schmeling resides in Gainesville and Baltimore. 12 2014 FALL Commen CementDoctor of Philosophy The Doctor of Philosophy degree was established in the late 19th century as the highest earned degree in American graduate schools. This degree program, which stresses competence in research, awards the credential most commonly held by college professors and researchers. Although requirements of the doctorate vary from one institution to another, certain prerequisites are typical: coursework, a qualifying examination, an approved dissertation and a final examination. Doctoral students work closely with a major professor who serves as an advisor, mentor, critic, confidant and promoter. Doctor of Education The Doctor of Education degree was introduced at the University of Florida in the mid-1940s. This degree is conferred in recognition of the development of sound scholarship in professional education and closely related fields, and demonstrated ability to apply that knowledge as an administrator, supervisor or teacher. Requirements vary by discipline but generally include coursework, a qualifying examination, the completion of a dissertation and final examinations. Students are mentored by a major professor and supported by a supervisory committee comprising members of the graduate faculty. Doctor of Audiology The Doctor of Audiology degree was first awarded to students at the University of Florida in 2000. This degree is the highest university award given in this field in recognition of completion of academic preparation for the clinical practice of audiology. The degree requires four years of study beyond the bachelor's degree, including academic coursework, supervised clinical experiences, yearly academic and clinical evaluation by the faculty, and a final examination. Doctor of Plant Medicine The Doctor of Plant Medicine degree was established at the University of Florida in 1999 to provide all segments of agriculture with rapid, accurate and scientifically sound diagnoses and management strategies for all types of plant health problems. This multidisciplinary program consists of courses and practical training in all relevant departments. Students are trained in the science, practice and business of the profession of plant medicine and complete coursework and written and oral comprehensive examinations. Doctor of Physical Therapy The Doctor of Physical Therapy degree is a professional doctoral program that prepares graduates to become entry-level physical therapists and was established at the University of Florida in 2005. The degree requires three years of coursework and clinical practicum beyond the bachelor's degree. Completion of the program enables graduates to sit for the licensure examination to practice physical therapy. Doctor of Nursing Practice The Doctor of Nursing Practice degree is a professional doctoral program that began admitting students in 2006 at the University of Florida. The degree prepares advanced practice nurses with the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed in today's complex health care environment. It produces advanced practice nurses with educational background comparable to health care practitioners in other fields.UF Graduate School The reputation of a research university is, in large part, measured by the excellence of its graduate faculty and graduate students. The University of Florida's graduate faculty and graduate students help to push the boundaries of research, develop the technologies of the future, improve the health of our citizenry, reshape our social and economic culture, expand scholarship, and create beauty in many forms. 13Graduate School henry t. frierSon , aSSociate vice PreSident and dean of the Graduate School doctor of PhiloSoPhy Paul W.

The chain was presented in 2004 during the installation ceremony of President J. Bernard Machen. The medallion centerpiece is a 1.3-carat orange diamond engraved with the portraits, names and service years of the university's 11 presidents. The Major Analytical Instruments Center at UF used ion beam engraving technology on the medallion. Also on the medallion are three .025-carat blue diamonds placed around the silhouette of the Century Tower and University Auditorium, signifying teaching, research and service. All four diamonds, donated by Gemesis Corp. of Sarasota, Florida, were grown using a process developed and patented by UF's Department of Materials Science and Engineering. Academic Mace \"Honoring the Past, Shaping the Future\" was the signature of the University of Florida's sesquicentennial celebration in 2003. It also was the inspiration for the ceremonial mace created and dedicated to mark this historic event. The mace dates back to the Middle Ages and symbolizes strength and authority; each is unique and reflects the values and characteristics of the institution. The university's chief marshal carries the mace at all academic processions. Designed and crafted on the University of Florida campus, the mace artfully symbolizes those elements important to the university's identity and history. The 70-inch ceremonial staff combines traditional elements with modern styling. The stylized alligator rests on the globe signifying the University of Florida as an adaptable global leader in teaching, research and service. The four pillars supporting the globe represent the four original colleges; Agriculture, Engineering, Liberal Arts and Law. The cone holds the University of Florida Seal and words to the Alma Mater. The staff is carved from native cherry wood. The acorn finial depicts the adage \"from tiny acorns mighty oaks do grow,\" a commitment to life long learning. The brick pattern on the handle symbolizes higher education tradition and structure. Like the institution it represents, the mace is not static; growth and movement are expressed with loose rings engraved with the names of the university's presidents and their years in office. Diplomas Diplomas will be mailed to the graduate's permanent home mailing address in February 2015. 44 2014 FALL Commen CementCaps and Gowns, An Explanation The academic attire worn by faculty and graduating students at today's commencement ceremony evolved from a style of dress worn by members of guilds and religious orders in medieval times. The black academic gown signifies that the individual wearing it has earned a degree in higher education. Distinctions in the sleeve shape indicate the type of degree held by the wearer of the black gown. A round, open sleeve identifies a doctoral degree; by comparison, a long, pointed sleeve indicates a bachelor's degree, while a long, closed sleeve with a slit near the upper part of the arm designates a master's degree. The doctoral costume also has velvet bands down the front of the gown and velvet cross bars on the sleeves. The trimming may be black, or it may match the color of the velvet hood edging. Colored tassels on the degree candidates' caps indicate a candidate's school or college. Graduate candidates also wear a hood. At the University of Florida the lining of the hood has a blue chevron on an orange background. In keeping with standards established for American universities in the late 19 th century, the color of the velvet edging on the academic hood represents the wearer's particular degree. White, used for the study of arts and letters, was inspired by the white fur trimming of the Oxford and Cambridge bachelor of arts hoods. Green was selected for medicine to reflect the color of medieval herbs, while golden yellow was chosen for the sciences to represent the wealth crated by scientific research.
