S.No Admission Confession 1. Admission usually relates to civil transaction and comprises all statements amounting to admission defined under section 17 of Indian Evidence Act and made by person mentioned under section 18, 19 and 20 of Indian Evidence Act . Confession is a statement made by an accused person which is sought to be proved against him in criminal proceeding to establish the commission of an offence by him. 2 Admissions are not conclusive as to the matters admitted but it may operate as an estoppel. Confession if deliberately and voluntarily made may be accepted as conclusive of the matters confessed. 1+1 16 | Page OR S.No Warrants Case Summons Case 1 A warrant case relates to offences punishable with death, imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term greater than two years. A summons case means a case relating to an offence that is not a warrant case, i.e. cases relating to offences punishable with imprisonment of less than two years. 2 The CrPC provides for two types of procedure for the trial of warrant cases by a magistrate: -those instituted upon a police report -those instituted upon complaint. In both cases, if the accused is not discharged, the magistrate holds a regular trial after \"framing the charge\". In summons cases, there is no need to frame a charge. The court gives the substance of the accusation, which is called 'notice' to the accused when t he person appears before the court. 23 Comment upon the evolution of legal aid in Criminal Law in India with relevant case laws. Ans: 1. Section 340(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, provided that if a man was charged with an offence punishable with death, the court could provide him with counsel upon his request. This was subjected to a twisted interpretation by the Supr eme Court by classifying it as a privilege rather than the duty of the magistrate in Tara Singh v. State (1951 AIR 441). 2+2 17 | Page 2. India in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, facilitated statutory implementation of free legal aid subsequently. Section 304(1 ) provides that: In a trial before the sessions judge, if the accused has not sufficient means to engage a pleader, the court should assign a pleader for his defense at the expense of the State. 24 For adoption of International Treaties into domestic law, UK and India follow different practices in accordance with their legal provisions. a) State the practices followed in UK and India. Ans: In the United Kingdom, there is a doctrine of transformation that states that before any international agreement can be considered applicable domestically it must be transformed into municipal law. This means that the provisions of the treaty need to be transformed into local law, passing a domestic legislation with concurrent provisions as the international obligations. India has dealt with the interplay of international law as fits the need of the day. While any restriction of rights requires the n eed for an amendment by legislature, enhancing or broadening the scope of such rights is allowed as long as there is nothing to the contrary or similar in domestic law. India generally follows that merely affirming a treaty by way of ratifying it by the as sent of the executive is sufficient, unless the treaty requires ratification by way of an act of the legislature. b) With reference to Maganbhai Patel v/s Union of India, explain how the Supreme Court of India implemented this practice. Ans: There has been a n evolution of the philosophy of the role of international treaties to which India is party to with relation to the Indian Constitution. In the case of Magan Bhai Patel v Union of India, the Supreme Court held that if a treaty or international agreement r estricts the rights of the citizens or modifies the laws of the state, it would require to have a legislative measure. E.g. If India is a party to an international agreement to stop the killing of a species of turtle, it restricts the right to trade of cer tain fishermen by prohibiting killing of the turtle. If this treaty is to be enforced in India, the Indian Parliament needs to pass a domestic legislation regarding prohibition of the killing of 1+1=2 2 18 | Page such turtle species. If no such right is restricted then it d oes not need to have a legislative measure to enact it or give rise to some weight in domestic law in the treaty. 25 The 14th law commission report under the chairmanship of MC Setalvad raised the concern about the tussle between executive and judiciary in the matter of appointment of judges. How was this tussle attempted to be resolved through the three judges cases? *A series of three judicial decisions popularly known as the Three Judges Cases helped in the development of the modern collegium system. *The first Judges case (1981) gave primacy to the Executive and stated that the CJI's recommendation to the President can be ref used for cogent reasons. It gave vast powers to the Executive for the next 12 years, in making judicial appointments. *This however was modified in the second Judges case (1993).The executive element in the appointment process was reduced to a minimum and political influence eliminated.The years that followed thus witnessed some confusion in the process of appointment as CJI made some unilateral appointments and the role of the President was reduced to a mere approval. *Later in 1998, the Supreme Court in a Presidential reference (1998 advisory decision) emphasized upon the role of 'consultation' and held that the process of appointment of Judges to the Supreme Court and the High Courts is an 'integrated participatory consultative process'. OR Differentiate between Attorney General and Advocate General. ATTORNEY GENERAL ADVOCATE GENERAL The Attorney General is the first legal According to Article 165 of the Constitution, 1X4=4 1X4=4 19 | Page officer of the country. The Attorney General of India is appointed by the President of India under Article 76 of the Constitution, which states that he can hold the office during the pleasure of the President. Advocate General is appointed by the Governor of the respective state and holds his office during pleasure of the Governor. The Attorney General must be a person qualified to be appointed as a Judge of the Supreme Court. The qualification required for appointment as an Advocate General is similar to that of a judge of a High Court It is the duty of theAttorney General for India to give advice to the Government of India upon legal matters and to perform other duties of legal character as may be referred or assigned to him by the President The Advocate General is the chief legal advisor of the State and performs duties of a legal character including representing the State before the courts. He is assisted by Solicitor General and Additional Solicitor General He is assisted by Additional Advocate General 26 Why the issue of allowing advertising and solicitation by lawyers requires balancing of interest? State the guidelines for advocates in India as given by the Bar Council of India for advertising. Ans: 1. The issue of allowing advertising and solicitation by lawyers requires balanc ing the interest of the public which includes getting information on legal rights and services through advertisements and enhancement of access to justice and the legal profession on one hand and the possible misuse of advertising techniques by lawyers whi ch may lead to a loss of credibility of the profession as a whole. 2. In India advertising by lawyers has been strictly restricted by the Bar Council of India. An 1X4=4 20 | Page advocate is prohibited from promoting himself through circulars, advertisements, touts, pers onal communications, interviews other than through personal relations, furnishing or inspiring newspaper comments or producing his photographs to be published in connection with cases in which he has been engaged or concerned. 3.An amendment to this rule allows advocates to furnish certain information on their websites after intimating and taking approval from the Bar Council of India. 4.However, only 5 pieces of information can be put up on the internet, that is first, the name of the advocate or the fir m, second, the contact details, third details of enrolment with the Bar, fourth, his professional and academic qualification and fifth the areas of practice. 27 What are the conditions required to satisfy the tort of False imprisonment? State its exception as well. Ans: The intentional tort of false imprisonment is satisfied whenever there is intent to unlawfully confine or restrain the claimant in a bounded area. When this actually causes the claimant to be knowingly confined or restrained in a b ounded area unlawfully. Even if the claimant is unaware that he is trapped but suffers injury, the tort of false imprisonment is satisfied. Exception to the Tort of False imprisonment: The claimant should not be trapped willingly and consensually. OR What is the principle of Absolute Liability? What did Justice PN Bhagwati hold in the famous 1987 case of MC Mehta v. Shri Ram Foods and Fertilizers Industries regarding this principle? Ans: An enterprise, which is engaged in a hazardous or inherently dangerous industry, which poses a potential threat to the health and safety of the persons working in the factory and residing in the surrounding areas owes an absolute and non -delegable duty to the community to ensure that no harm results to any one on ac count of hazardous or inherently dangerous activity. Justice PN Bhagwati in the famous 1987 case of MC Mehta v. Shri Ram Foods and Fertilizers Industries held that i. hazardous or inherently dangerous activity in which an enterprise is engaged must be con ducted 1+3=4 1+3 21 | Page with the highest standards of safety ii. if any harm is done on account of such activity, the enterprise must be absolutely liable to compensate for such harm iii. it should be no answer to the enterprise to say that it had taken all reasonable c are and that the harm occurred without any negligence on its part. 28 Why are customs a disputed source of international law? Ans:1. International custom generally refers to a State practice, but only such practice as is accepted by the States themselves as legally required. Once a certain practice is understood to be customary law, States are obliged to act as the rule of customary international law prescribes. This description of International custom has been criticised for its exac t formulation. 2.According to Article 38 of its Statute, the International Court of Justice 'whose function is to decide in accordance with international law such disputes as are submitted to it,' has to apply, inter alia, 'international custom.' 3.This s ource of public international law is described, in the same Article, as 'evidence of a general practice accepted as law.' 4.International customary law is probably the most disputed and discussed source of international law. The reason for this is that it is not clear when a particular State practice becomes a legally binding State practice. It is also unclear how one can identify a rule of international custom, or how one can prove its existence. 1X4=4 29 What features of the fundamental rights give them a high pedestal in the Constitutional framework. Ans:The features of fundamental rights that give them a high pedestal in the Indian Constitution are: 1. They are enforceable by the higher courts in India. Article 32 provides the right to the aggrieved ones, whose fundamental rights have been violated or denied, to petition the Supreme Court for the enforcement of fundamental rights. 2X3=6 22 | Page 2. Article 13 elevates t he authority of fundamental rights. It ensures that the State or other competent authority do not make laws that contradicts or takes away or breaches the fundamental rights. 3. Fundamental rights are mostly enforceable against the State and in some cases against private persons. OR State any 2 features of Directive Principles of State Policy. Also give 3 differences between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy. Ans:Two features of Directive Principle of State Policy are: 1. It is the duty of the State to apply these principles in making laws and policies on social and human development. 2. These principles are largely of the nature of economic and social rights. 3. The provisions of directive principles are not enforceable by any court of law, but they provide guidance in carrying out and drafting laws and policies regarding human and social development. 4. Supreme Court has raised the status of many provisions of d irective principles to that of fundamental right by suggesting they violate one's right to life (Art. 21). 5. Directive principles aim at promoting the welfare of the people. They intend to secure and protect social, economic and political justice of its citizens. 6. These principles endeavor to minimize income inequalities and to eliminate inequalities based on st atus, facilities, and opportunities amongst both individuals and groups of people.(Any 2) Difference between Fundamental rights and DPSPs are: FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF STATE POLICY 2 4 23 | Page Basic, inalienable rights guaranteed by the Constitution to citizens and at times non citizen of the Country Aspirations or goals drafted in the Constitution which the State should aim to achieve The are mentioned in Part III(Article 12 -35) They are mentioned in Part IV(Article 36 - 51) They are enf orceable by the Higher Courts in India They are non enforceable in nature They are largely civil and political in nature They are social and economical in nature 30 Comment with reasons on the type of ADR that can be most effective in resolving the following situations - a.
