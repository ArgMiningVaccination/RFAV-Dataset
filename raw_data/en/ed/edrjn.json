However, the ability of such immune responses to recogni ze and therefore protect against emerging variants is a matter of increasing importance . Such variants of concern (VOC) include isolates of lineage B1.1.7 , first ide ntified in the UK , and B1.351 , first identified in South Africa. Our data confirm t hat VOC, particularly those with substitutions at residues 484 and 417 escape neutralization by antibodies directed to the ACE2 -binding Class 1 and the adjacent Class 2 epit opes but are susceptible to neutralization by the generally less potent antibodies directed to Class 3 and 4 epitopes on the flanks RBD . To address this potential threat, we sampled a SARS -CoV-2 uninfected UK cohort recently vaccinated with BNT162b2 (Pfizer -BioNTech , two doses delivered 18 -28 days apart ), alongside a cohort naturally inf ected in the first wave of the epidemic in Spring 2020 . We tested antibody and T cell responses against a reference isolate (VIC001) representing the original circulati ng lineage B and the impact of sequence variation in these two VOCs. We identified a reduction in antibody neutr alizat ion against the VOCs which was most evident in the B1.351 variant . However, the majority of the T cell response was directed against epito pes conserved across all three strains. Th e reduction in antibody neutr alizat ion was less marked in post -boost vaccine -induced than in naturally -induced immune responses and could be largely explained by the potency of the homotypic antibody response. However , after a single vaccination , which induced only modest ly neutralizing homotypic antibody titres, neutr alizat ion against the VOCs was completely abrogated in the majority of vaccinees. These data indicate that VOCs may evade prot ective neutralising responses induced by prior infection , and to a lesser extent by immunizati on, particularly after a single vaccine , but the impact of the VOCs on T cell responses appears less marke d. The results emphasize the need to generate high poten cy immune responses through vaccination in order to provide protection against these and other emergent variants . We observed that two doses of vaccine also induced a significant increase in binding antibodies to spike of both SARS -CoV-1 & MERS, in additio n to the four common coronaviruses currently circulating in the UK . The impact of antigenic imprintin g on the po tency of humoral and cellular heterotypic protection generated by the next generation of variant -directed vaccines remains to be determined .

Introduction The emergence of new lineages of SARS -CoV-2 on three continents towards the end of 2020, and their rapid expansion at the expense of the previously dominant lineages, poses significant challenges to public health (WHO | SARS -CoV-2 Variants )1. In order to address these challenges effectively, there is an urgent need to understand the biological consequences of the mutations found in the se lineages , and the consequential impact on their susceptibility to current control measures, including vaccines, drugs a nd non - pharmaceutical interventions. All three variants share the N501 Y substitution in the receptor -binding domain (RBD) of spike glycoprotein (S), which increases binding affinity of S with the virus's cellular receptor, ACE2 2 (see Figure 1 ). Lineage B.1.1 .7, first identified in the UK in September 2020 (1), is characterized by additional mutations in S, such as deletion of residues 69 & 70 and the P681H substitution for which plausible effects on the virus biology are proposed, as well as five other mutations in S, a premature stop codon in ORF8 , three substitutions and a deletion in ORF1 and two amino acid su bstitutions in nucleoprotein ( N) of as -yet unknown significance. Lineage B.1.351 3 was first identified in November 2020 in South Africa and is characterized by two additional substitutions of likely significance in RBD, namely, K417N and E484K . The former is predicted to disrupt a salt bridge with D30 of ACE2 , a characteristic of SARS -CoV-2 in distinction to SARS -CoV-1, but may not impact on binding , whereas the latter , which might disrupt the interaction of RBD with K31 of hACE2 , may enhance ACE2 binding 24. Very recently (Jan 2021) E484K has been detected first in lineage B1.1.7 in the UK 5 and subsequently in lineages A23.1, B.1 and B.1.177 , as well as in imported cases of B.1.51 and P.2 2. Our data confirm that VOC, particularly those such as B1.351 with substitutions at res idues 484 and 417, escape neutralization by antibodies directed to the ACE2 -binding Class 1 and the adjacent Class 2 epitopes, but are susceptible to neutralization by the generally less potent antibodies directed to Class 3 and 4 epitopes on the flanks of the RBD 1 Preliminary genomic characterisation of an emergent SARS -CoV-2 lineage in the U K defined by a novel set of spike mutations - SARS -CoV-2 coronavirus / nCoV -2019 Genomic Epidemiology - Virological 2 regularly at Nextstrain / groups / neherlab / ncov / S.E484 The immune correlates of protection against infection and disease caused by SARS -CoV-2 are imperfectly understood (recently reviewed by 6 ). Classically, neutralization by antibody , measured by reduction in plaque or infectious fo ci by authentic virus in vitro is considered a major component of protection, though indirect effects of antibody, such as complement activation and opsonization may also play a role in vivo . Recent studies have demonstrated that symptomatic re -infection within six months after the first wave in the UK was very rare in the presence of anti-S or anti -N IgG antibodies 7,8. Virus-specific lymphocytes may play an important direct role in protection, in addition to their indirect effect mediated through help to antibody -producing cells. Robust T cell immune responses (with CD4+ T cells domina ting) to S, M, N and some ORF antigen s are readily detected after infection, correlate with disease severity and are durable for at least several months 9-11. Furthermore, CD8 depletion studies in non-human primate ( NHP ) challenge studies suggest T cells also play a protective role especially when antibody levels are low 12 13 . Nevertheless, passive infusion of neutraliz ing antibody has been shown to b e sufficient to mediate effective protection against SARS -CoV-2 in these rhesus macaque challenge studies 13 , encouraging the evaluation convalescent sera and monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) cocktails as early therapeutic interventions. In common with endemic human coronaviruses , immunity following recovery from natural infection does not appear to be always sufficient to prevent re-infection , although the increase in frequency of such cases towards the end of 2020 appears to b e linked to the emergence of antigenically distinct lineages (see above) . At the time of writing (February 2021 ) multip le vaccines have been reported to have efficacy against COV ID-19 disease in phase III clinical trials. Of these, three - BNT162b2, mRNA -1273 and Sputnik V - that were reported to have efficacies in the mid -90% range , had also induce d classical neutralising antibody titres substantially higher than those found on average in convalescent patien ts 14-16. In contrast, one - Coron aVac - that showed approximately 50% efficacy , had been reported to induce neutralising titres several -fold lower than those found in convalescent patien ts 17. The two remaining vaccines, BBIP -CorV and AZD122 2 (ChAd Ox-1 nCoV-19), had intermediate values of both clinical efficacy and relative potency in generating neutralising antibody responses 18,19. mRNA and Adenovirus - vectored vaccines e high magnitude SARS -CoV-2 multispecific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells responses . Reports of vaccines assessed in South Africa where B.1.351 dominates are currently emerging and include Ad26.COV2.S (single dose Ad26 vectored va ccine ), Novovax (recombinant Spike/adjuvant) and CAZD1222 . Each of the studies report reduced efficacy in South African populations. Vaccine correlates of protection , and the relative contribution of T cell and humoral immunity are yet to be precisely def ined since detailed immune analysis in people with vaccine breakthrough infections is lacking . In pseudotype virus assays - in which S is not chaperoned by viral membrane proteins M and E, buds at the plasma membrane rather than internally, and has an imm ature quaternary structure that appears to render it variably more sensitive to neutralization by antibody - it appears that convalescent sera from patients exposed to prototype strain s of SARS -CoV-2, in distinction to vaccine -elicited responses, may not b e effective in neutralizing lineage B1.351 20,21. As the lineage -defining substitutions include changes in previously identified antibody epitopes and regions of S associated with its processing and rearrangement during cellular infectio n, this is a very plausible observation. In order to test whether c onvalescent sera and sera from vaccine recipients were similarly affected in their ability to neutralize authentic virions, we have undertaken classical neutralization assays against refere nce isolates of both B1.1.7 and B1.351 compared to the prototype, e arly pandemic, B VIC01 isolate. We find that, while cross -neutralization of B1.1.7 is only modestly reduced compared to that of the prototype strain, cross -neutralization of B1.351 is markedly reduced. This effect is particularly marked in convalescent ser a and in a very minor (<10%) subset of those that had mounted somewhat modest neutralizing responses to the vaccine. Since viral mutations may also affect T cell recognition, we evaluate th e contribution of T cells that target epitopes located at site s of amino acid substitution in the spike glycoproteins of VOCs. We ev aluated the T cell response to peptides spanning the entire spike protein in an interferon -gam ma (IFN- ) ELISpot assay and found that the majority of T cell responses in recipients of two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine are gene rated by epitopes that are invariant between the prototype Victoria strain and the three VOCs. Our results suggest that reformulation of vaccines to addr ess new variant lineages ought to be considered and indicates that seasonal re -vaccination might be required for this virus. We also show that neutr alizat ion of VOC is significantly enhanced by a second boost vaccination. There is legitimate concern that antigenic imprinti ng during vaccination to prototype S antigen blunt s the response to variant sequences incorporated into next - generation vaccines. However, our results show that vaccination not only induces enhanced reactivity to S from endemic human coron aviruses , but also significant cross -reactivity to both SARS -CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. Encouragingly, we find evidence that the T cell epitopes that dominate responses in these same individuals, are not subject to major substitution in the three variants of conc ern. Methods Volunteer samples Volunteers were recruited at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation T rust in ethically approved studies and included : 1) Hospitalised patients with severe COVID -19 defined as SARS -CoV-2 PCR positive and requiring in patie nt oxygen support , recruited under study CMORE (research ethics committee (REC) : North West - Preston, REC reference 20/NW/0235 ); 2) Health care Workers (HCWs) with asymptomatic or mild symptomatic COVID -19 disease defined as SARS -CoV-2 PCR positive disease and not requiring O2 support/hospit alizat ion and; 3) HCW s not known to be previously infected with SARS -CoV-2, sampled 7 -17 days after receiving COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2, 30 micrograms, administered intramuscularly after dilution as a series of two doses (0.3 mL each) 18-28 days apart (study OPTIC: Oxford Translational Gastrointestinal Unit GI Biobank Study 1 6/YH/0247 [[REC at Yorkshire & The Humber - Sheffield] 2). The study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (2008) and the International Confer ence on Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines. Written infor med consent was obtained for all patients enrolled in the study . Virus isolates Prototype isolate (PANGO lineage B) was Victoria/01/2 02022 (B VIC01) , received at P 3 from PHE Porton Down (after being supplied by the Doherty Centre Melbourne) in April 2020, passaged in Vero E6/TMPRSS 2 cells , used here Oxford at P1 from PHE Porton Down in December 2020, passaged in Vero E6/TMPRSS 2 isolate23 was received at P3 from the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA), Durban, in Oxford in January 2021 isolates, identity was confirmed by deep sequencing at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford. Microneutralization Assay (MNA) The study was performed in the CL3 Facility of the University of Oxford opera ting under license from the HSE, on the basis of an agreed C ode of Practice, Risk Assessments (under ACDP) and Standard Operating Procedures. The m icroneutralization assay determines the concentration of antibody that produces a 50% reduction in infectious focus -forming units of authentic SARS -CoV-2 in Vero CCL81 cells, as follows. Quadruplicate serial dilutions of serum or monoclonal antibody were p reincubated with a fixed dose of SARS -CoV-2 before incubation with Vero cells. A 1.5% carboxymethyl cellulose -containing overlay was used to prevent satellite focus form ation. Twenty hours post -infection, the monolayers were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with -100 and nucl eocapsid ( N) antigen spike s EY 2A and 6A, respectively 24. with peroxidase -conjugated antibody and TrueBlue peroxidase substrate, infectious foci were by ELISPOT reader. Data were analysed using four -parameter logistic regression (Hill equation) in GraphPad Prism 8.3. Mesoscale Discovery (MSD) binding assays IgG SARS -CoV-2, SARS -CoV-1, MERS and seasonal CoVs were measured using multiplexed MSD immunoassay : the V-PLEX COVID (Cat # ) from Meso Scale Diagnostics, Rockville, MD USA . A MULTI -SPOT\u00ae 96-well, 10 Spot Plate was coated with three SARS CoV -2 antigens (S, RBD, N), SARS and MERS spike trimers, as well as proteins from 3). Multiplex MSD Assays were performed as per the instructions of the manufacturer. To m easure IgG antibodies, 96 -well plates were blocked with MSD Bloc ker A for 30 minutes. Following washing with washing buffer, samples diluted 1:500 in diluent buffer, as well as the reference standard and internal controls were added to the wells. After 2 -hour incubation and a washing step, detection antibody (MSD SULFO -TAG Anti -Human IgG Antibody, 1/200) was added. Following washing, MSD GOLD Read Buffer B was added and plate s were read using a MESO\u00ae SECTOR S 600 Reader. Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal -Wallis one -way ANOVA. Peptides used -CoV2 peptides , 15-18 amino -acids overlapping by 11 amino -acids and spanning the entire spike region , were used in two pools (Mimotopes) CMV, EBV, influenza and tetanus antigens (CEFT) were a single pool (2 \u00b5g/m L: Proimmune , Oxford, UK ). Single p eptides (Mim otope s, Victoria Australia ) that mapped to sites with mutations in B1.1.7 (n=17), B1.351 (n=21) and P.1 (n=22) with reference to Victoria strain were used in single peptides or pooled by strain . IFN- T cell ELISpot assays Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by density gradient centrifugation using LymphoprepTM (p=1.077 g /mL, Stem Cell Technologies), washed twice with RPMI 1640 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) containing 10% heat FCS (Sigma), 1mM Pe -Glutamine and counted using the Guava\u00ae ViaCountTM assay on the Muse Cell Analyzer (Luminex Cooperation). PBMCs were frozen a nd stored before use . 96-well Multiscreen -I plat es (Millipore, U K) were 3 hours with 10 g /mL GZ-4 anti-human IFN - (Mabtech, AB, Sweden) at room temperature. PBMC were added at 2x 105 cells in 50 l per well and stimulated with 50 l of SARS -CoV-2 peptide pools (2ug /mL per peptide) with DMS O (final concentration 0.4%, Sigma) was used as negative control and CEFT ((2 \u00b5g/mL , Proimmune) / Concanavalin A (5 \u00b5g/mL final concentration, Sigma) were used as positive control antigens . After 16 -18 hours at 37C PBMC were removed and sec reted IFN - -IFN- biotinylated mAb at 1 g/mL (7-B6-1-biotin, followed by streptavidin alkaline phosphatase at 1 g /mL for 1 -2 hours (SP -3020, Vector Labs). The plates were developed using BCIP/NBT substrate (Pie rce) accordi ng to the manufacturer's instructions. ELISpot plates were read using an AID ELISpot Reader (v.4.0). Results were reported as spot -forming units (SFU)/106 PBMC. Background (mean SFU in negative control wells) was subtracted fro m antigen stimula ted wells to give the final result. Expression and purification of monoclonal antibodies Monoclonal antibodies used in this study were produced as previously descri bed25. The variable heavy and light genes of these mAbs were cloned into the human IgG1 , human kappa light chain or lambda light chain expression vectors (AbVec -hIgG1, AbVec -hIgKappa or AbVec -hIgLambda). The plasmids were transfected into the Expi293F (Gibco) cell line for expression of recombinant full -length human IgG1 according to manufacturer's protocol. Harvested supernatant was clarified at 3,000 g for 10min and filtered ( 0.22 m) before affinity purification using a HiTrap MabSelect SuRe column (Cytivia , Westborough MA, USA ) according to manufacturer's instruction. Eluted IgG1 were concentrated, and buffer exchanged into PBS using an Amicon Ultra -15 filter unit with 30k molecular weight cut -off. Results Homotypic and Heterotypic neutralization of key SARS -CoV-2 lineages by antibody. The primary structure of the Spike glycoprotein , and the characteristic sequence variants of the current three lineag es of concern are illustrated in Figure 1 . In this study , we analysed the homotypic neutralization of the prototype strain by monoclonal pients of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccine , which are each induced by prototypic S antigen, and heterotypic neutralization by these same antibodies of two new lineages of concern (B1.1.7 and B1.351) . In Figure 1, we indicate the residues of S at which the respective lineage - as well as a third lineage of concern, P.1 - differ from prototype. Neutralization by sera from convalescent COVID -19 individuals Sera from convalescent individuals neutralized prototype virus with highly variable potency (see Figure 2a). The neutralization potency against Lentiv irus (SARS -CoV-2 S) pseudotypes broadly - but imperfectly - corresponded with homotypic neutralization of authentic virus . Sera neutralized 95% CL: 1.5 3-fold), potency heterotypic neutralization potency against the B1.3 51 isolate was more marked with 5/9 having undetectably low neutralizing potency. Neutralization by sera from vaccine recipients. After a single dose of BNT162b2 vaccine , 10/11 sera showed homotypic neutralization potency equivalent to that of the more modest half of convalescent sera (NT50 ~ 1/100 , see Figure 11 sera against B1.351 . Sera from 23/25 individuals drawn between 7 and 17 days after two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine administered 18 to 28 days a part neutralized prototype virus with high potency (NT50 >> 1/100 , Figure 2c), whereas 2/25 < NT50 < 95% CL: 1.5 - 3-fold), but in no case was neutralization undetectable. The decline in neutralization poten cy agai nst the B1.351 isolate was somewhat greater on average but only the 2 /25 with modest homotypic neutralization potency had undetectable heterotypic neutralizing potency. The data from convalescent individual s and those having received vaccine are sum marized in Fig2 D, showing the trend to lower neutralization potency across the three genotypes of virus , which is least marked in those receiving two doses of vaccine. The relationship of the neutralizing titre of each individual's r neutr alizing titre against each VOC is displayed in Fig 2E and shows clear pairwise correlation . epitopes of RBD and by reference serum In order to understand better the reasons for differences between the homoty pic and heterotypic neutralization potency of polyclonal human sera seen above, we made use of a panel of six, epitope -mapped neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (NmAbs, Figure 2 F, and Fig S1) 25-28. We have devised a \"squirrel\" diagram to help visualise the binding sites of the various mAbs on the RBD (Figure 2d). One NmAb, FI 3A, a Class 1 RBD mAb (binds to the left side of the head of the squirrel) whose homotypic NT50 is of the order of 1 nM, is largely unaffected by the changes in B1 .1.7 HMPP1 (NT50 = 1.365 ) but does not Two other NmAbs, GR 12C and C121 that are Class 2 RBD binding mAb (that bind to the right side of the head of th e squirrel) , and which have homotypic NT50 ~ 0.1 nM, show some reduced effectiveness in neutralizing B1.1.7 HMPP1 and have lost all potency against B1.351 HW001. This might be expected, as class 2 antibodies bind to an epitope that includes residue 484 (re viewed by Barnes et al and 29). In contrast, NmAb FD 11A and S309 , which are Class mAb, that bind to the rig ht haunch of the squirrel , and EY 6A, Class 4 mAb, that bind s to the left haunch of the squirrel, appear s to be unaffected by the mutations in the VOCs. Polyclonal responses generated by different individuals to natural infectio n or in response to vaccina tion may include a varying proportion of antibodies to these a nd other neutralization epitopes. We also noted significant deviations in heterotypic neutralization p otency against a currently approved reference serum 20/130 (NIBSC, 1/729.6 - 1/1,165), the result of 1:1280 quoted on the 20/130 data sheet, neutralization of B1.1.7 HMPP1 was enhanced by approximately 10 -fold, but of B1.351 HV01 was reduced by >10 -fold. Binding of antibodies to Alpha and Beta Coronavirus proteins We probed the antibody -binding p roperties of sera from and control sera using a customised MSD coronavirus antigen array ELISA (Figure 3). We observed that sera from individuals receiving two doses of the Pfizer vaccine showed significantly higher binding to both SARS -CoV-2 spike and RBD compared to those receiving single dose and to convalescent individuals one month after infection (Fig 3 A, and B, respectively) . The absence of antibody binding to N (Fig 3C) confirms that all vaccinated individuals are na\u00efve for SARS -CoV-2 infection. There was significant antibody binding to both SARS -CoV-1 and MERS spike protein in vaccinated and COVID -19 convalescent individuals compared to the negative contro l sera (Fig 3D & E, respectively ). This was particularly marked for SARS -CoV-1 reactivity in fully vaccinated individuals , suggesting that vaccine can induce a broad response to widely shared epitopes, such as those exemplified by EY 6A (see above) and CR302230. We a lso screened for antibody binding to the spike antigen of the four common coronaviruses circulating in the UK (Fig 3 F -I). There is a significant increase in binding to all four , particularly to the Betacoronavirus clade A isolates, o the Alphacoronavirus isola tes, 229E and, to a lesser extent, NL63S was also greater in the post -boost vaccin ees, but not in convalescent sera . T cell responses to Spike antigens in prototype strain Victoria and VOCs Following two doses of BNT162b2 , spike -specific T cells were detected in all magnitude 561, range 110-1717 SFC/106 PBMC) against spike antigens in IFN - ELISpot assays (Fig 4A). Assessing t he contribution of T cells that target epitopes l ocated at the site of B1.1.7, B1.351 and P.1 specific mutation sites we find that T cells target ed epitopes spanning all spike mutation site s (Fig 4B) (8, 9 and 10 epito pes in lineage B1.1.7, B1.351 and P.1 respectively ). In each individual, T cells targeted 0-19, mean 6) epitopes located at mutation sites . The overall contribution of these, to the total spike specific response (mean magnitude and range) is 13% (0-67%) , 14% (0 -44%) neut ralization by immunoassay Authentic virus neutralization assays require specialist staff and facilities that are not widely available , and access to reference isolates of viru s that are laborious to distribute. Accordingly, we asked whether high throughput ELISA -style immunoassays could provide a degree of predictive value for heterotypic neutralization. Using the Mesoscale discovery (MSD ) assay, we investigated the relationshi p between the bindin g activity of serum to homotypic SARS -CoV-2 S and its heterotypic neutralization potency against both SARS -CoV-2 VOCs, and its ability to bind to other pandemic and endemic human coronaviruses. The correlation coefficients are summarize d and the individua l data are shown in Figure 5. Unsurprisingly, binding to SARS -CoV-2 S correlates very strongly with binding to SARS -CoV-2 S in convalescent sera, though surprisingly less well in post -boost vaccinees , who, reassuringly, showed no reacti vity to SARS -CoV-2 N. S binding in vaccinees predicted homotypic and heterotypic neutralization moderately (0.5 > Spearman r > 0.4, *) . S binding offered no predictive value for either homotypic or heterotypic neutralization in convalescent sera . Interestin activity in post -vaccine sera to SARS -CoV-2 R predicted binding to MERS -CoV S very well (r = 0.69, ***) but not to SARS -CoV-1 S. While SARS -CoV-2 S binding activity in vaccinee sera predicted binding to the S of one endemic beta cor onavirus (O C43 S r = 0.57, ** ; HKU1 S , r = 0.44, * ) it did not predict binding to the other two endemic coronaviruses. Conversely , RBD binding predicted neutralization of VIC01 very well (Spearman r = 0.57, **), but neutralization of B1.1.7 less well (r=0. 48, *) and of B1.351 not at all (r=0.35, ns), and showed an inverted relationship in binding to other epidemic coronavirus S proteins (SARS - CoV-1 S, r = 0.67, *** ; MERS-CoV S , r = 0.52, * ; data not shown ). Discussion Our results show that overall, both binding and neutralization by antibodies induced by prototyp ic S protein is diminished to S from recent variants of concern (VOC) ; B1.351 to a greater extent than B1.1.7. This broad trend masks both qualitative and quantitative differences in antibody responses by indi viduals , whose serum may contain differing proportions of antibodies to neutralizing epitopes that we show here are sometimes conserved between strains and always reduced in VOCs , particularly to B1.351 . Although , in principle, neutralization results usin g pseudotype viruses and in vitro binding assays may not reliably predict the potency of heterotypic immune protection a fforded by natural infection or immunization by prototypic SARS -CoV-2, our results using authentic virus largely substantiate provisiona l conclusions recently made using such data. Encouraging ly, we find that the majority of T cell responses in recipients of two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine are generated by epitopes that are invariant between the prot otype and two of the current variants of concern (B1.1.7 and B1.351) . T cell responses to SARS -CoV-2 are known to target a wide range of regions in spike 31, 8. Moreover , in over 90% of these recipients , heterotypic neutralizing titres (NT50) remain comfortably above the level associat ed with immune protection in recent vaccine trials. However, in a majority of individuals whose homotypic neutralization titres were more modest - including over 50% of convalescent COVID -19 individuals and recipients of a single dose of vaccine - heteroty pic neutralization dropped to negligible levels. This loss of cross -neutr alizat ion was particularly notable against B1.351 with potential implications for vaccine efficacy in populations where this VOC dominates and when only moderate level s of S antibodie s are generated after vaccination . It should b e noted that neutr alizat ion escape , observ ed in a well of a micro -titre plate , is not direct evidence of vaccine failure 32-34. Non -neutrali sing antigen -specific antibodies , T cells and innate lymphocytes clearly have the potential to contribute to vaccine efficacy 35. The acceptance that prior infection with influenza virus results in reduced disease against subsequent infection with heterosubtypic strains, in both human and animal challenge studies, provides further evidence that cellular com ponents and non -neutralising antibodies make an important contribution to protecti on 33. We also note that the recent South African and UK Nov avax vaccine clinical trials show ed 50-80% protective efficacy against infection for the B1.351 and B1.1. 7 VOC respectively . Furthermore, cases of vaccinated individuals requiring hospit alizat ion due to severe disease were extremely rare for these VOCs . Ongoing analysis of real -world vaccine roll out will illuminate the extent of v accine brea kthrough with VOC s. Nevertheless , our results re -emphasize the urgent need to deploy the most effective vaccine strategies as widely and rapidly as possible in order to provide population protection against the emerging lineages of concern of SARS -CoV-2. Our findings show clearly that the weaker responses generate d for example by natural infection or single doses of vaccine , do not provide adequate cross -neutr alizat ion. The question remains, however, whether antigenic imprinting to prior infection or vacci nation with proto typic antigen will pose a significant obstacle to the newly formulated vaccine candidates, incorporating sequences derived from the variants of concern . Figure Legends Figure 1. Sequence variation in Spike glycoprotein . The open reading frame encoding Spik e is illustrated , with the position of key features of processing and function indicated to approximate scale (residue number indicated above). During cotranslational translocation to the ER, the short leader peptide (LP) is prot eolytically removed. Following folding, trimer assembly and glycos ylation in the ER and Golgi, the trans -Golgi localized protease, furin, cleaves the S1 S2 llowing binding of the receptor -binding domain the S2' site, facilitating conformational changes t o spike that result in fusion of the virus envelope with the plasma membrane. Variant residue positions are indicated below, and their ap proximate location on the S polypeptide is indicated. Residue identities are shown at each of these positions for a prototype isolate , Victoria/01/2020 (VIC01, PANGO lineage B), and at each position in the three lineages of interest (B1.1.7, B1.351, and P. 1) at which the respective lineage differs from prototype. indicates deletion of one or more residues. Note, there are lineage -defining substitutions outside RBD, in the N-terminal domain (NTD) and C -terminal domain (CTD) of S1 (dark blue) , and in S2 (tan). These may include chang es that directly or indirectly affect antibody -mediated neutralization by loss or altered dynamics of epitope, respectively. Figure 2 .
