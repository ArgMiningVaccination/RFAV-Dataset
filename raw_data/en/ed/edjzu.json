Integrative oncology is a patient -centered , evidence -informed field of cancer care that utilizes mind and body practices , natural products, and/or lifestyle modifications from different traditions alongside conventional cancer treatments . Integrative oncology aims to optimize health, quality of life, and clinical outcomes across the cancer continuum and to empower people to prevent cancer and become active participants before, during and beyond cancer treatment.

The acupuncture technique that has been most often studied scientifically involves penetrating the skin with thin, solid, metallic needles that are manipulated by the hands or by electrical stimulation. 11TCM: Acupuncture Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) explains acupuncture as a method for balancing the flow of energy \u2014known as Qi(Chi) \u2014 believed to flow through pathways (meridians) in your body. 12TCM theory: Pain Pain arises when there is obstruction of the free flow of qi within the channels (meridians). By manipulating specific acupuncture points you can restore the free flow of qi and relieve pain.13Coincide in part with trigger points and myofascial planes Acupuncture points are places to stimulate nerves, muscles and connective tissue. This stimulation can release your body's natural painkillers, increases blood flow and reduce inflammation Appear rich in nerve endings Have lower electrical resistance than surrounding tissueWhat are the meridians?14Acupuncture points and myofascia Location of acupuncture points and meridians in serial gross anatomical sections through a human arm Langevin & Yandow , Anat Rec. 2002; 269:257 release of endogenous opioids (i.e. endorphins, enkephalins, dynorphins). Studies have demonstrated that acupuncture can induce analgesia, but that these effects were blocked by naloxone, an opioid antagonist.

Step 1: Place your hand so your palm is facing up Step 2: Place 3 fingers of your opposite hand across your wrist. Then, place your thumb on the point just below your index finger. You should be able to feel two large tendons under your thumb. Step 3: Using your thumb, apply pressure on this point between the tendons for 1-2 minutes. Acupressure for Nausea and Vomiting: Point PC -6 Step 1: Locate point at center of \"V\" between thumb and index finger Step 2: With hand flexed, massage the muscle between the thumb and index finger. Apply firm pressure for 1 -2 min, repeat on opposite hand and as often as needed.Acupressure for Headache and Pain: Point LI -4 Step 1: Sit back in a comfortable position. Step 2: Place your right thumb or forefinger between your eyebrows (see figure). Step 3: Apply pressure in a circular motion on this point for 1-3 minutes. The pressure should be gentle and should not cause pain.

Background Despite the efficacy of aromatase inhibitors (AIs), many patients suffer from joint side effects --> leading to non -compliance. Compliance to AIs is associated with improved disease -free survival. Acupuncture is a popular non -pharmacologic modality for the treatment of a variety of medical conditions. Several small studies have suggested acupuncture may be beneficial for AI -arthralgias ; however others have shown no benefit. The overall interpretation of these trials has been uncertain due to short duration, small sample sizes and differences in methodology. Hershman, DL. JCO,2008 Chrigwin . JH.

Acupuncture versus venlafaxine for the management of vasomotor symptoms in patients with hormone receptor - positive breast cancer: a randomized controlled trial. (N=50) \"Acupuncture may be a safe and effective alternative to drug therapy for reducing hot flashes in breast cancer patients.\" Walker, et al. J Clin Oncol. 2010 Feb 1;28(4):634 -40.Trial 1 2 3 4 Conclusions We have shown consistently, with multiple measures assessing pain and stiffness, that true acupuncture generated better outcomes than either control group in a large multicenter randomized controlled trial. Transitioning from twice -a-week to once -a-week acupuncture maintained the effect of the intervention. The intervention effects persisted 12 weeks following completion of the intervention. The toxicity of the intervention was minimal and limited to grade 1 bruising.

For patients reluctant to take a prescription medication, that can result in other side effects, acupuncture provides a safe and effective alternative. Identification of non -opioid options for pain control is a public health priority.
