The healing power of plants has been recognized for centuries to deepen the response to treatment. Medical grade aromatherapy is particularly beneficial to people who may be afraid of needles, who are very weak, or children. For those of you interested in enhancing fertility we have a special interest, experience, and success in addressing those concerns and desires. Acupuncture can strengthen systems vital to reproduction, greatly increase chances of pregnancy, and heal specific conditions that may affect your fertility. In addition, it can be used in conjunction with and support Western-based reproductive technologies. Acupuncture is used successfully with western medicine. Acupuncture practitioners cooperate with other health providers and do not recommend altering medications or other therapies without consulting your personal physician or provider. Our practice devotes the time to examining your nutritional habits, work and family demands, and lifestyle practices, all of which can affect your health.
