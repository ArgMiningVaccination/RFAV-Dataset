With the view to obtaining a marketingauthorisation, an application dossier containing particu- lars and documents relating to the results of tests and trials carried out on this medicinal product must be submitted. (2) The detailed scientific and technical requirements ofAnnex I to Directive 2001/83/EC need to be adapted to take account of scientific and technical progress and inparticular of a large set of new requirements resulting from recent legislation. The presentation and content of the marketing authorisation application dossier have tobe improved in order to facilitate the assessment and the better use of certain parts of the dossier which are common to several medicinal products. (3) Within the framework of the International Conferenceon Harmonisation (ICH) a consensus was reached in 2000 to provide a harmonised format and terminology for a Common Technical Document through whicha homogeneous organisation and presentation of a marketing authorisation application dossier for human medicinal products could be achieved. Standardisedmarketing authorisation dossier requirements should therefore be introduced in order to implement the Common Technical Document without delay. (1) OJ L 311, 28.11.2001, p. 67. (2) OJ L 33, 8.2.2003, p. 30.(4) The standardised marketing authorisation dossier requirements (harmonised format) should be applicableto any type of medicinal product for human use, regardless of the procedure for the granting of the marketing authorisation. Some medicinal products pre- sent, however, such specific features that all the require- ments cannot be fulfilled. To take account of theseparticular situations, a simplified dossier presentation should be provided for. (5) The safety of biological medicinal products relies onrigorous control of their starting materials. Requirements for the suitability of human donors and the testingof donations of starting materials for plasma-derived medicinal products are laid down by Directive 2002/98/ EC setting standards of quality and safety for thecollection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of human blood and blood components and amending Directive 2001/83/EC. Article 109 of Directive 2001/ 83/EC has been amended. Plasma-derived medicinal products per se are biological medicinal products, themanufacture of which is based on the careful handling of human plasma as a starting material. To take account of the fact that the same plasma material is used in most cases for several medicinal products and, as a result, that a substantial part of the marketing authorisation dossiermay be common to a great number of other dossiers for totally different plasma-derived medicinal products, it is appropriate to establish a new system aimed at simplify-ing procedures for both the approval of and subsequent changes to human plasma-derived medicinal products. To this end the concept of a plasma master file (PMF) should be introduced, in particular in order to allow the pooling of national expertise and through thecoordination by the EMEA of a single evaluation. A PMF should serve as a stand-alone document, which is separate from the marketing authorisation dossier and through which a harmonised control of the relevant information regarding starting material used for themanufacture of plasma-derived medicinal products could be achieved. The PMF system should consist of a two-step assessment: first, an assessment of the PMFcarried out at Community level, the result of which, i.e. a certificate of compliance with the Community legislation for each PMF, must be taken into account by any national competent authority, preventing them of any subsequent reassessment; second, an assessment ofthe finished plasma-derived medicinal product contain- ing the modified part of the PMF (the two essential parts of the content, plasma origin and plasma quality-safety).27.6.2003 EN L 159/47 Official Journal of the European Union This should remain the task of the competent authority that granted the marketing authorisation for the plasma-derived medicinal product. (6) In the case of vaccines for human use, the same antigen may be common to several medicinal products (vaccines) and any change to that particular antigen, ipso facto ,m a y impact, therefore, on several vaccines authorised by different procedures. In order to simplify the existingprocedures for the assessment of such vaccines, both for the granting of a first marketing authorisation and for subsequent changes to it due to modifications to the manufacturing process and testing of individual antigens involved in combined vaccines, a new system based onthe concept of a vaccine antigen master file (VAMF) should be introduced. This VAMF will allow the pooling of national expertise, and through the coordination bythe EMEA, a single evaluation of the concerned vaccine antigen. The VAMF should serve as a stand-alone part of the marketing authorisation dossier and provide all relevant information of a biological and chemical nature related to one specific antigen, which constitutes one ofthe active substances of one or several combined vaccines. (7) The VAMF system should consist of a two-step assess- ment: first, an assessment of the VAMF carried out at Community level, the result of which, i.e. a certificate of compliance with the Community legislation for eachVAMF, must be taken into account by any national competent authority, preventing them from any sub- sequent reassessment; second, an assessment of the finished medicinal product (combined vaccine) contain- ing the modified antigen which is the task of thecompetent authority that granted the combined vaccine marketing authorisation. (8) Herbal medicinal products differ substantially from conventional medicinal products in so far as they are intrinsically associated with the very particular notion of herbal substances and herbal preparations. It is thereforeappropriate to determine specific requirements in respect of these products with regard to the standardised marketing authorisation requirements. (9) The treatment of various acquired and inherited patho-logical dysfunctions in humans calls upon novel con- cept-based approaches based on the development of biotechnology techniques. The latter involve the use of advanced therapy medicinal products based on processes focused on various gene-transfer-produced bio-mol-ecules (gene therapy medicinal products) and manipu- lated or processed cells (cell therapy medicinal products) as active substances.(10) In so far as they achieve their essential action throughmetabolic, physiological and immunological means torestore, correct or modify physiological functions in humans, these novel complex therapeutic products representing a new category of biological medicinal products in the sense of Articles 1 and 2 of Directive 2001/83/EC. The general principles already applicableto these products should be specified from a scientific and technical point of view and the specific requirements with regard to the standardised marketing authorisationrequirements should be determined. (11) Directive 2001/83/EC should be amended accordingly. (12) The measures provided for in this Directive are inaccordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: Article 1 Directive 2001/83/EC is amended as follows: a) in the second paragraph of Article 22 the words 'Part 4 (G)' are replaced by the following: 'Part II, point 6'; b) Annex I is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Directive.

(3) This Module shall in addition supply detailed information on the starting and raw materials used during the manufacturing operations of the active substance(s) and on the excipients incorporatedin the formulation of the finished medicinal product. (4) All the procedures and methods used for manufacturing and controlling the active substance and the finished medicinal product shall be described in sufficient details to enable them to be repeatedin control tests, carried out at the request of the competent authority. All test procedures shall correspond to the state of scientific progress at the time and shall be validated. Results of the validation studies shall be provided. In the case of test procedures included in the EuropeanPharmacopoeia, this description shall be replaced by the appropriate detailed reference to the monograph(s) and general chapter(s). (5) The monographs of the European Pharmacopoeia shall be applicable to all substances, preparations and pharmaceutical forms appearing in it. In respect of other substances, each Member State may require observance of its own national pharmacopoeia. However, where a material in the European Pharmacopoeia or in the pharmacopoeia of a Member State has been prepared by a method liable to leave impurities not controlled in the pharmacopoeiamonograph, these impurities and their maximum tolerance limits must be declared and a suitabletest procedure must be described. In cases where a specification contained in a monograph of the European Pharmacopoeia or in the national pharmacopoeia of a Member State might be insufficient to ensure the quality of the substance, the competent authorities may request more appropriatespecifications from the marketing authorisation holder. The competent authorities shall inform the authorities responsible for the pharmacopoeia in question. The marketing authorisation holder shall provide the authorities of that pharmacopoeia with the details of the alleged insufficiency andthe additional specifications applied. In the case of analytical procedures included in the European Pharmacopoeia, this description shall be replaced in each relevant section by the appropriate detailed reference to the monograph(s) andgeneral chapter(s). (6) In case where starting and raw materials, active substance(s) or excipient(s) are described neither in the European Pharmacopoeia nor in the pharmacopoeia of a Member State, compliance with the monograph of a third country pharmacopoeia can be accepted. In such cases, the applicant shall submit a copy of the monograph accompanied by the validation of the analytical procedurescontained in the monograph and by a translation where appropriate. (7) Where the active substance and/or a raw and starting material or excipient(s) are the subject of a monograph of the European Pharmacopoeia, the applicant can apply for a certificate of suitabilitythat, where granted by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines, shall be presented in the relevant section of this Module. Those certificates of suitability of the monograph of the European Pharmacopoeia are deemed to replace the relevant data of the corresponding sectionsdescribed in this Module. The manufacturer shall give the assurance in writing to the applicant that the manufacturing process has not been modified since the granting of the certificate of suitability by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines.27.6.2003 EN L 159/61 Official Journal of the European Union (8) For a well-defined active substance, the active substance manufacturer or the applicant may arrange for the (i) detailed description of the manufacturing process, (ii) quality control during manufacture, and(iii) process validationto be supplied in a separate document directly to the competent authorities by the manufacturer of the active substance as an Active Substance Master File. In this case, the manufacturer shall, however, provide the applicant with all of the data, which may be necessary for the latter to take responsibility for the medicinal product. The manufacturer shall confirm in writing to the applicant that he shall ensure batch to batch consistency and not modifythe manufacturing process or specifications without informing the applicant. Documents and particulars supporting the application for such a change shall be supplied to the competent authorities; these documents and particulars will be also supplied to the applicant when theyconcern the open part of the active substance master file.

Content: basic principles and requirements Special attention shall be paid to the following selected elements.(1) The pharmacological and toxicological tests must show: a) the potential toxicity of the product and any dangerous or undesirable toxic effects that may occur under the proposed conditions of use in human beings; these should be evaluated inrelation to the pathological condition concerned; b) the pharmacological properties of the product, in both qualitative and quantitative relationship to the proposed use in human beings. All results must be reliable and of general applicability. Whenever appropriate, mathematical and statistical procedures shall be used in designing theexperimental methods and in evaluating the results. Additionally, it is necessary for clinicians to be given information about the therapeutic and toxicological potential of the product.27.6.2003 EN L 159/69 Official Journal of the European Union (2) For biological medicinal products such as immunological medicinal products and medicinal products derived from human blood or plasma, the requirements of this Module may have to be adapted for individual products; therefore the testing program carried out shall be justified by the applicant. In establishing the testing program, the following shall be taken into consideration: all tests requiring repeated administration of the product shall be designed to take account of the possible induction of, and interference by, antibodies; examination of reproductive function, of embryo/foetal and peri-natal toxicity, of mutagenic potential and of carcinogenic potential shall be considered. Where constituents other than the active substance(s) are incriminated, validation of their removal may replace the study. (3) The toxicology and pharmaco-kinetics of an excipient used for the first time in the pharmaceutical field shall be investigated. (4) Where there is a possibility of significant degradation during storage of the medicinal product, the toxicology of degradation products must be considered. 4.2.1. Pharmacology Pharmacology study shall follow two distinct lines of approach.\u2014 Firstly, the actions relating to the proposed therapeutic use shall be adequately investigated and described. Where possible, recognised and validated assays, both in vivo and in vitro, shall be used. Novel experimental techniques must be described in such detail as to allow them to be reproduced.The results shall be expressed in quantitative terms using, for example, dose-effect curves, time- effect curves, etc. Wherever possible, comparisons shall be made with data relating to a substance or substances with a similar therapeutic action. \u2014 Secondly, the applicant shall investigate the potential undesirable pharmaco-dynamic effects of the substance on physiological functions. These investigations shall be performed at exposures in the anticipated therapeutic range and above. The experimental techniques, unless they are standardprocedures, must be described in such detail as to allow them to be reproduced, and the investigator must establish their validity. Any suspected modification of responses resulting from repeated administration of the substance shall be investigated. For the pharmaco-dynamic medicinal product interaction, tests on combinations of active substances may be prompted either by pharmacological premises or by indications of therapeutic effect. In the first case, the pharmaco-dynamic study shall demonstrate those interactions, which might make thecombination of value in therapeutic use. In the second case, where scientific justification for thecombination is sought through therapeutic experimentation, the investigation shall determine whether the effects expected from the combination can be demonstrated in animals, and the importance of any collateral effects shall at least be investigated. 4.2.2. Pharmaco-kinetics Pharmaco-kinetics means the study of the fate of the active substance, and its metabolites, within the organism, and covers the study of the absorption, distribution, metabolism (bio-transformation) and excretion of these substances. The study of these different phases may be carried mainly by means of physical, chemical or possibly by biological methods, and by observation of the actual pharmaco-dynamic activity of the substance itself. Information on distribution and elimination shall be necessary in all cases where such data are indispensable to determine the dosage for humans, and in respect of chemo-therapeutic substances (antibiotics, etc.) and substances whose use depends on their non-pharmaco-dynamic effects (e.g. numerous diagnostic agents, etc.).L 159/70 EN 27.6.2003 Official Journal of the European Union In vitro studies also can be carried out with the advantage of using human material for comparison with animal material (i.e. protein binding, metabolism, drug-drug interaction). Pharmaco-kinetic investigation of all pharmacologically active substances is necessary. In the case of new combinations of known substances, which have been investigated in accordance with the provisions of this Directive, pharmaco-kinetic studies may not be required, if the toxicity tests and therapeutic experimentation justify their omission. The pharmaco-kinetic program shall be design to allow comparison and extrapolation between animal and human. 4.2.3. Toxicology a) Single-dose toxicity A single-dose toxicity test shall mean a qualitative and quantitative study of the toxic reactions, which may result from a single administration of the active substance or substances contained in the medicinal product, in the proportions and physico-chemical state in which they are present inthe actual product. The single-dose toxicity test must be carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines published by the Agency. b) Repeat-dose toxicity Repeated dose toxicity tests are intended to reveal any physiological and/or anatomo-pathological changes induced by repeated administration of the active substance or combination of activesubstances under examination, and to determine how these changes are related to dosage. Generally, it is desirable that two tests be performed: one short term, lasting two to four weeks, the other long-term. The duration of the latter shall depend on the conditions of clinical use. Its purpose is to describe potential adverse effects to which attention should be paid in clinical studies. The duration is defined in the relevant guidelines published by the Agency. c) Geno-toxicity The purposes of the study of mutagenic and clastogenic potential is to reveal the changes which a substance may cause in the genetic material of individuals or cells. Mutagenic substances may present a hazard to health since exposure to a mutagen carries the risk of inducing germ-linemutation, with the possibility of inherited disorders, and the risk of somatic mutations includingthose leading to cancer. These studies are obligatory for any new substance. d) Carcino-genicity Tests to reveal carcinogenic effects shall normally be required: 1. These studies shall be performed for any medicinal product whose expected clinical use is for a prolonged period of a patient's life, either continuously or repeatedly in an intermittent manner. 2. These studies are recommended for some medicinal products if there is concern about their carcinogenic potential, e.g. from product of the same class or similar structure, or fromevidence in repeated dose toxicity studies. 3. Studies with unequivocally geno-toxic compounds are not needed, as they are presumed to be trans-species carcinogens, implying a hazard to humans. If such a medicinal product is intended to be administered chronically to humans a chronic study may be necessary to detect early tumorigenic effects.27.6.2003 EN L 159/71 Official Journal of the European Union e) Reproductive and developmental toxicity Investigation of possible impairment of male or female reproductive function as well as harmful effects on progeny shall be performed by appropriate tests. These tests comprise studies of effect on adult male or female reproductive function, studies of the toxic and teratogenic effects at all stages of development from conception to sexual maturity as well as latent effects, when the medicinal product under investigation has been administered to the female during pregnancy. Omission of these tests must be adequately justified.Depending on the indicated use of the medicinal product, additional studies addressing development when administering the medicinal product of the offspring may be warranted. Embryo/foetal toxicity studies shall normally be conducted on two mammalian species, one of which shall be other than a rodent. Peri- and postnatal studies shall be conducted in at least one species. If the metabolism of a medicinal product in particular species is known to be similar to that in man, it is desirable to include this species. It is also desirable that one of the species is the sameas in the repeated dose toxicity studies. The state of scientific knowledge at the time when the application is lodged shall be taken into account when determining the study design. f) Local tolerance The purpose of local tolerance studies is to ascertain whether medicinal products (both active substances and excipients) are tolerated at sites in the body, which may come into contact with themedicinal product as a result of its administration in clinical use. The testing strategy shall be suchthat any mechanical effects of administration or purely physico-chemical actions of the product can be distinguished from toxicological or pharmaco-dynamic ones. Local tolerance testing shall be conducted with the preparation being developed for human use, using the vehicle and/or excipients in treating the control group(s). Positive controls/referencesubstances shall be included where necessary. The design of local tolerance tests (choice of species, duration, frequency and route of administration, doses) will depend upon the problem to be investigated and the proposed conditions of administration in clinical use. Reversibility of local lesions shall be performed where relevant. Studies in animals can be substituted by validated in vitro tests provided that the test results are of comparable quality and usefulness for the purpose of safety evaluation. For chemicals applied to the skin (e.g. dermal, rectal, vaginal) the sensitising potential shall be evaluated in at least one of the test systems currently available (the guinea pig assay or the locallymph node assay). 5.

Content: basic principles and requirements Special attention shall be paid to the following selected elements.a) The clinical particulars to be provided pursuant to Articles 8 (3) (i) and 10 (1) must enable a sufficiently well-founded and scientifically valid opinion to be formed as to whether the medicinalproduct satisfies the criteria governing the granting of a marketing authorisation. Consequently, anessential requirement is that the results of all clinical trials should be communicated, both favourable and unfavourable. b) Clinical trials must always be preceded by adequate pharmacological and toxicological tests, carried out on animals in accordance with the requirements of Module 4 of this Annex. The investigator must acquaint himself with the conclusions drawn from the pharmacological and toxicologicalstudies and hence the applicant must provide him at least with the investigator's brochure, consistingof all the relevant information known prior to the onset of a clinical trial including chemical, pharmaceutical and biological data, toxicological, pharmaco-kinetic and pharmaco-dynamic data in animals and the results of earlier clinical trials, with adequate data to justify the nature, scale andduration of the proposed trial; the complete pharmacological and toxicological reports shall be provided on request. For materials of human or animal origin, all available means shall be employed to ensure safety from transmission of infectious agents prior to the commencement of the trial.27.6.2003 EN L 159/73 Official Journal of the European Union c) Marketing authorisation holders must arrange for essential clinical trial documents (including case report forms) other than subject's medical files, to be kept by the owners of the data: \u2014 for at least 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the trial,\u2014 or for at least two years after the granting of the last marketing authorisation in the European Community and when there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in theEuropean Community, \u2014 or for at least two years after formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. Subject's medical files should be retained in accordance with applicable legislation and in accordance with the maximum period of time permitted by the hospital, institution or private practice. The documents can be retained for a longer period, however, if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by agreement with the sponsor. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform thehospital, institution or practice as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. The sponsor or other owner of the data shall retain all other documentation pertaining to the trial as long as the product is authorised. This documentation shall include: the protocol including the rationale, objectives and statistical design and methodology of the trial, with conditions under whichit is performed and managed, and details of the investigational product, the reference medicinal product and/or the placebo used; standard operating procedures; all written opinions on the protocol and procedures; the investigator's brochure; case report forms on each trial subject; finalreport; audit certificate(s), if available. The final report shall be retained by the sponsor or subsequentowner, for five years after the medicinal product is no longer authorised. In addition for trials conducted within the European Community, the marketing authorisation holder shall make any additional arrangements for archiving of documentation in accordance withthe provisions of Directive 2001/20/EC and implementing detailed guidelines. Any change of ownership of the data shall be documented. All data and documents shall be made available if requested by relevant authorities. d) The particulars of each clinical trial must contain sufficient detail to allow an objective judgement to be made: \u2014 the protocol, including the rationale, objectives and statistical design and methodology of the trial, with conditions under which it is performed and managed, and details of the investigational medicinal product used \u2014 audit certificate(s), if available \u2014 the list of investigator(s), and each investigator shall give his name, address, appointments, qualifications and clinical duties, state where the trial was carried out and assemble the information in respect of each patient individually, including case report forms on each trialsubject \u2014 final report signed by the investigator and for multi-centre trials, by all the investigators or the co-ordinating (principal) investigator. e) The particulars of clinical trials referred to above shall be forwarded to the competent authorities. However, in agreement with the competent authorities, the applicant may omit part of this information. Complete documentation shall be provided forthwith upon request. The investigator shall, in his conclusions on the experimental evidence, express an opinion on the safety of the product under normal conditions of use, its tolerance, its efficacy and any useful information relating to indications and contra-indications, dosage and average duration of treatment as well as any special precautions to be taken during treatment and the clinical symptoms of overdosage. In reporting the results of a multi-centre study, the principal investigator shall, in his conclusions, express an opinion on the safety and efficacy of the investigational medicinal product on behalf of all centres.L 159/74 EN 27.6.2003 Official Journal of the European Union f) The clinical observations shall be summarised for each trial indicating: 1) the number and sex of subjects treated; 2) the selection and age-distribution of the groups of patients being investigated and the comparative tests; 3) the number of patients withdrawn prematurely from the trials and the reasons for such withdrawal; 4) where controlled trials were carried out under the above conditions, whether the control group: \u2014 received no treatment \u2014 received a placebo \u2014 received another medicinal product of known effect\u2014 received treatment other than therapy using medicinal products 5) the frequency of observed adverse reactions; 6) details concerning patients who may be at increased risk, e.g. elderly people, children, women during pregnancy or menstruation, or whose physiological or pathological condition requires special consideration; 7) parameters or evaluation criteria of efficacy and the results in terms of these parameters; 8) a statistical evaluation of the results when this is called for by the design of the trials and the variable factors involved. g) In addition, the investigator shall always indicate his observations on: 1) any signs of habituation, addiction or difficulty in weaning patients from the medicinal product; 2) any interactions that have been observed with other medicinal products administered concomitantly; 3) the criteria determining exclusion of certain patients from the trials; 4) any deaths which occurred during the trial or within the follow-up period. h) Particulars concerning a new combination of medicinal substances must be identical to those required for new medicinal products and must substantiate the safety and efficacy of the combination. i) Total or partial omission of data must be explained. Should unexpected results occur during the course of the trials, further pre clinical toxicological and pharmacological tests must be undertaken and reviewed. j) If the medicinal product is intended for long-term administration, particulars shall be given of any modification of the pharmacological action following repeated administration, as well as theestablishment of long-term dosage. 5.2.1. Reports of bio-pharmaceutics studies Bio-availability study reports, comparative bio-availability, bio-equivalence study reports, reports on in vitro and in vivo correlation study, and bio-analytical and analytical methods shall be provided.27.6.2003 EN L 159/75 Official Journal of the European Union In addition, an assessment of bio-availability shall be undertaken where necessary to demonstrate bio- equivalence for the medicinal products referred to in Article 10 (1) (a). 5.2.2. Reports of studies pertinent to pharmaco-kinetics using human bio-materials For the purposes of this Annex, human bio-materials shall mean any proteins, cells, tissues and related materials derived from human sources that are used in vitro or ex vivo to assess pharmaco-kinetics properties of drug substances. In this respect, reports of plasma protein binding study, hepatic metabolism and active substance interaction studies and studies using other human bio-materials shall be provided. 5.2.3. Reports of human pharmaco-kinetic studies a) The following pharmaco-kinetic characteristics shall be described: \u2014 absorption (rate and extent), \u2014 distribution,\u2014 metabolism,\u2014 excretion. Clinically significant features including the implication of the kinetic data for the dosage regimen especially for patients at risk, and differences between man and animal species used in the preclinical studies, shall be described. In addition to standard multiple-sample pharmaco-kinetics studies, population pharmaco-kinetics analyses based on sparse sampling during clinical studies can also address questions about thecontributions of intrinsic and extrinsic factors to the variability in the dose- pharmaco-kinetics response relationship. Reports of pharmaco-kinetic and initial tolerability studies in healthy subjects and in patients, reports of pharmaco-kinetic studies to assess effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors,and reports of population pharmaco-kinetic studies shall be provided. b) If the medicinal product is normally to be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products, particulars shall be given of joint administration tests performed to demonstrate possible modification of the pharmacological action. Pharmaco-kinetic interactions between the active substance and other medicinal products or substances shall be investigated. 5.2.4. Reports of human pharmaco-dynamic studies a) The pharmaco-dynamic action correlated to the efficacy shall be demonstrated including: \u2014 the dose-response relationship and its time course, \u2014 justification for the dosage and conditions of administration,\u2014 the mode of action, if possible. The pharmaco-dynamic action not related to efficacy shall be described.The demonstration of pharmaco-dynamic effects in human beings shall not in itself be sufficient to justify conclusions regarding any particular potential therapeutic effect.L 159/76 EN 27.6.2003 Official Journal of the European Union b) If the medicinal product is normally to be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products, particulars shall be given of joint administration tests performed to demonstrate possible modification of the pharmacological action. Pharmaco-dynamic interactions between the active substance and other medicinal products or substances shall be investigated. 5.2.5. Reports of efficacy and safety studies 5.2.5.1. S t u d y R e p o r t s o f C o n t r o l l e d C l i n i c a l S t u d i e s P e r t i n e n t t o t h e C l a i m e d Indication In general, clinical trials shall be done as 'controlled clinical trials' if possible, randomised and as appropriate versus placebo and versus an established medicinal product of proven therapeutic value; any other design shall be justified. The treatment of the control groups will vary from case to case and also will depend on ethical considerations and therapeutic area; thus it may, in some instances, be morepertinent to compare the efficacy of a new medicinal product with that of an established medicinal product of proven therapeutic value rather than with the effect of a placebo. (1) As far as possible, and particularly in trials where the effect of the product cannot be objectively measured, steps shall be taken to avoid bias, including methods of randomisation and blinding. (2) The protocol of the trial must include a thorough description of the statistical methods to be employed, the number and reasons for inclusion of patients (including calculations of the power of the trial), the level of significance to be used and a description of the statistical unit. Measures taken to avoid bias, particularly methods of randomisation, shall be documented. Inclusion of a largenumber of subjects in a trial must not be regarded as an adequate substitute for a properly controlledtrial. The safety data shall be reviewed taking into account guidelines published by the Commission, with particular attention to events resulting in changes of dose or need for concomitant medication, serious adverse events, events resulting in withdrawal, and deaths. Any patients or patient groups at increasedrisk shall be identified and particular attention paid to potentially vulnerable patients who may be present in small numbers, e.g., children, pregnant women, frail elderly, people with marked abnormalities of metabolism or excretion etc. The implication of the safety evaluation for the possible uses of the medicinalproduct shall be described. 5.2.5.2. S t u d y r e p o r t s o f u n c o n t r o l l e d c l i n i c a l s t u d i e s r e p o r t s o f a n a l y s e s o f d a t a from more than one study and other clinical study reports These reports shall be provided. 5.2.6. Reports of post-marketing experience If the medicinal product is already authorised in third countries, information shall be given in respect of adverse reactions of the medicinal product concerned and medicinal products containing the same active substance(s), in relation to the usage rates if possible. 5.2.7. Case reports forms and individual patient listings When submitted in accordance with the relevant Guideline published by the Agency, case report forms and individual patient data listings shall be provided and presented in the same order as the clinical study reports and indexed by study.27.6.2003 EN L 159/77 Official Journal of the European Union PART II SPECIFIC MARKETING AUTHORISATION DOSSIERS AND REQUIREMENTS Some medicinal products present specific features which are such that all the requirements of the marketing authorisation application dossier as laid down in Part I of this Annex need to be adapted. To take account of theseparticular situations, an appropriate and adapted presentation of the dossier shall be followed by applicants. 1. WELL-ESTABLISHED MEDICINAL USE For medicinal products the active substance(s) of which has/have a 'well-established medicinal use' as referred to Article 10(1)(a)(ii), with recognised efficacy and an acceptable level of safety, the following specific rules shall apply. The applicant shall submit Modules 1, 2 and 3 as described in part I of this Annex. For Modules 4 and 5, a detailed scientific bibliography shall address non-clinical and clinical characteristics.The following specific rules shall apply in order to demonstrate the well-established medicinal use: a) Factors which have to be taken into account in order to establish a well-established medicinal use of constituents of medicinal products are: \u2014 the time over which a substance has been used,\u2014 quantitative aspects of the use of the substance,\u2014 the degree of scientific interest in the use of the substance (reflected in the published scientific literature) and \u2014 the coherence of scientific assessments. Therefore different periods of time may be necessary for establishing well-established use of different substances. In any case, however, the period of time required for establishing a well established medicinal use of a constituent of a medicinal product must not be less than one decade from thefirst systematic and documented use of that substance as a medicinal product in the Community. b) The documentation submitted by the applicant should cover all aspects of the safety and/or efficacy assessment and must include or refer to a review of the relevant literature, taking into account pre-and post-marketing studies and published scientific literature concerning experience in the form ofepidemiological studies and in particular of comparative epidemiological studies. All documentation, both favourable and unfavourable, must be communicated. With respect to the provisions on 'well- established medicinal use' it is in particular necessary to clarify that 'bibliographic reference' to othersources of evidence (post marketing studies, epidemiological studies, etc.) and not just data related to tests and trials may serve as a valid proof of safety and efficacy of a product if an application explains and justifies the use of these sources of information satisfactorily. c) Particular attention must be paid to any missing information and justification must be given why demonstration of an acceptable level of safety and/or efficacy can be supported although some studies are lacking. d) The non-clinical and/or clinical overviews must explain the relevance of any data submitted which concern a product different from the product intended for marketing. A judgement must be made whether the product studied can be considered as similar to the product, for which application for a marketing authorisation has been made in spite of the existing differences. e) Post-marketing experience with other products containing the same constituents is of particular importance and applicants should put a special emphasis on this issue.L 159/78 EN 27.6.2003 Official Journal of the European Union 2. ESSENTIALLY SIMILAR MEDICINAL PRODUCTS a) Applications based upon Article 10(1) (a) (i) (essentially similar products) shall contain the data described in Modules 1, 2 and 3 of Part I of this Annex provided the applicant has been granted theconsent of the holder of the original marketing authorisation to cross refer to the content of hisModules 4 and 5. b) Applications based upon Article 10(1) (a) (iii) (essentially similar products i.e. generics) shall contain the data described in Modules 1, 2 and 3 of Part I of this Annex together with data showing bio- availability and bio-equivalence with the original medicinal product provided the latter is not a biological medicinal product (see Part II, 4 Similar biological medicinal products). For these products the non-clinical/clinical overviews/summaries shall particularly focus on the following elements: \u2014 the grounds for claiming essential similarity; \u2014 a summary of impurities present in batches of the active substance(s) as well as those of the finished medicinal product (and where relevant decomposition products arising during storage) as proposedfor use in the product to be marketed together with an evaluation of these impurities; \u2014 an evaluation of the bio-equivalence studies or a justification why studies were not performed with respect to the guideline on 'Investigation of Bio-availability and Bio-equivalence'; \u2014 an update of published literature relevant to the substance and the present application. It may be acceptable for articles in 'peer review' journals to be annotated for this purpose; \u2014 every claim in the summary of product characteristics not known from or inferred from the properties of the medicinal product and/or its therapeutic group should be discussed in the non clinical/clinical overviews/summaries and substantiated by published literature and/or additional studies. \u2014 if applicable, additional data in order to demonstrate evidence on the equivalence of safety and efficacy properties of different salts, esters or derivatives of an authorised active substance should beprovided by the applicant when he claims essential similarity. 3. ADDITIONAL DATA REQUIRED IN SPECIFIC SITUATIONS Where the active substance of an essentially similar medicinal product contains the same therapeutic moiety as the original authorised product associated with a different salt/ester complex/derivative evidence that there is no change in the pharmaco-kinetics of the moiety, pharmaco-dynamics and/or in toxicitywhich could change the safety/efficacy profile shall be demonstrated. Should this not be the case, this association shall be considered as a new active substance. Where a medicinal product is intended for a different therapeutic use or presented in a different pharmaceutical form or to be administered by different routes or in different doses or with a different posology, the results of appropriate toxicological and pharmacological tests and/or of clinical trials shall be provided. 4. SIMILAR BIOLOGICAL MEDICINAL PRODUCTS The provisions of Article 10(1)(a) (iii) may not be sufficient in the case of biological medicinal products. If the information required in the case of essentially similar products (generics) does not permit the demonstration of the similar nature of two biological medicinal products, additional data, in particular,the toxicological and clinical profile shall be provided. When a biological medicinal product as defined in Part I, paragraph 3.2 of this Annex, which refers to an original medicinal product having been granted a marketing authorisation in the Community, is submitted for a marketing authorisation by an independent applicant after the expiry of data protection period, the following approach shall be applied.27.6.2003 EN L 159/79 Official Journal of the European Union \u2014 Information to be supplied shall not be limited to Modules 1, 2 and 3 (pharmaceutical, chemical and biological data), supplemented with bio-equivalence and bio-availability data. The type and amount of additional data (i.e. toxicological and other non-clinical and appropriate clinical data) shall be determined on a case by case basis in accordance with relevant scientific guidelines. \u2014 Due to the diversity of biological medicinal products, the need for identified studies foreseen in Modules 4 and 5, shall be required by the competent authority, taking into account the specificcharacteristic of each individual medicinal product. The general principles to be applied are addressed in a guideline taking into account the characteristics of the concerned biological medicinal product published by the Agency. In case the originally authorised medicinal product has more than one indication, the efficacy and safety of the medicinal product claimedto be similar has to be justified or, if necessary, demonstrated separately for each of the claimed indications. 5. FIXED COMBINATION MEDICINAL PRODUCTS Applications based upon Article 10 (1) (b) shall relate to new medicinal products made of at least two active substances not previously authorised as a fixed combination medicinal product. For those applications a full dossier (Modules 1 to 5) shall be provided for the fixed combination medicinal product. Where applicable, information regarding the manufacturing sites and the adventitiousagents, safety evaluation shall be provided. 6. DOCUMENTATION FOR APPLICATIONS IN EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES When, as provided for in Article 22, the applicant can show that he is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use, because: \u2014 the indications for which the product in question is intended are encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence, or \u2014 in the present state of scientific knowledge, comprehensive information cannot be provided, or \u2014 it would be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical ethics to collect such information, marketing authorisation may be granted subject to certain specific obligations. These obligations may include the following: \u2014 the applicant shall complete an identified programme of studies within a time period specified by the competent authority, the results of which shall form the basis of a reassessment of the benefit/ risk profile, \u2014 the medicinal product in question may be supplied on medical prescription only and may in certain cases be administered only under strict medical supervision, possibly in a hospital and in the case ofa radio-pharmaceutical, by an authorised person, \u2014 the package leaflet and any medical information shall draw the attention of the medical practitioner to the fact that the particulars available concerning the medicinal product in question are as yetinadequate in certain specified respects. 7. MIXED MARKETING AUTHORISATION APPLICATIONS Mixed marketing-authorisation applications shall mean marketing-authorisation application dossiers where Module 4 and/or 5 consists of a combination of reports of limited non-clinical and/or clinicalstudies carried out by the applicant and of bibliographical references. All other Module(s) are in accordance with the structure described in Part I of this Annex. The competent authority shall accept the proposed format presented by the applicant on a case by case basis.L 159/80 EN 27.6.2003 Official Journal of the European Union PART III PARTICULAR MEDICINAL PRODUCTS This Part lays down specific requirements related to the nature of identified medicinal products. 1. BIOLOGICAL MEDICINAL PRODUCTS 1.1. Plasma-derived medicinal product For medicinal products derived from human blood or plasma and by derogation from the provisions of Module 3, the dossier requirements mentioned in 'Information related to the starting and raw materials',for starting materials made of human blood/plasma may be replaced by a Plasma Master File certified in accordance with this Part. a) P r i n c i p l e s For the purposes of this Annex: \u2014 Plasma Master File shall mean a stand-alone documentation, which is separate from the dossier for marketing authorisation which provides all relevant detailed information on the characteristics ofthe entire human plasma used as a starting material and/or a raw material for the manufacture ofsub/intermediate fractions, constituents of the excipient and active substance(s), which are part of medicinal products or medical devices referred to in Directive 2000/70/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 November 2000 amending Council Directive 93/42/EC asregards medical devices incorporating stable derivatives of human blood or human plasma ( 1). \u2014 Every centre or establishment for fractionation/processing of human plasma shall prepare and keep updated the set of detailed relevant information referred to in the Plasma Master File. \u2014 The Plasma Master File shall be submitted to the Agency or to the competent authority by the applicant for a marketing authorisation or the holder of the marketing authorisation. Where theapplicant for a marketing authorisation or the marketing authorisation holder differs from the holder of the Plasma Master File, the Plasma Master File shall be made available to the applicant or marketing authorisation holder for submission to the competent authority. In any case, the applicantor marketing authorisation holder shall take responsibility for the medicinal product. \u2014 The competent authority that is evaluating the marketing authorisation shall await for the Agency to issue the certificate before deciding on the application. \u2014 Any marketing authorisation dossier containing a human plasma-derived constituent shall refer to the Plasma Master File corresponding to the plasma used as a starting/raw material. b) C o n t e n t In accordance with the provisions of Article 109, as amended by Directive 2002/98/EC, which refers to the requirements for donors and the testing of donations, the Plasma Master File shall include informationon the plasma used as starting/raw material, in particular: (1) OJ L 313, 13.12.2000, p. 22.27.6.2003 EN L 159/81 Official Journal of the European Union (1) Plasma origin (i) information on centres or establishments in which blood/plasma collection is carried out, including inspection and approval, and epidemiological data on blood transmissible infections. (ii) information on centres or establishments in which testing of donations and plasma pools is carried out, including inspection and approval status.

(iv) conditions of storage and transport of plasma.(v) procedures for any inventory hold and/or quarantine period.(vi) characterisation of the plasma pool. (3) System in place between the plasma-derived medicinal product manufacturer and/or plasma fractionator/processor on the one hand, and blood/plasma collection and testing centres or establishments on the other hand, which defines the conditions of their interaction and their agreed specifications. In addition, the Plasma Master File shall provide a list of the medicinal products for which the Plasma Master File is valid, whether the medicinal products have been granted a marketing authorisation or are in the process of being granted such an authorisation, including medicinal products referred to in Article 2 of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and of theCouncil relating to the implementation of good clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for human use. c ) Evaluation and Certification \u2014 For medicinal products not yet authorised, the marketing authorisation applicant shall submit a full dossier to a competent authority, which shall be accompanied by a separate Plasma Master Filewhere one does not already exist. \u2014 The Plasma Master File is subject to a scientific and technical evaluation carried out by the Agency. A positive evaluation shall result in a certificate of compliance with Community legislation for thePlasma Master File, which shall be accompanied by the evaluation report. The certificate issued shall apply throughout the Community. \u2014 The Plasma Master File shall be updated and re-certified on an annual basis.L 159/82 EN 27.6.2003 Official Journal of the European Union \u2014 Changes subsequently introduced to the terms of a Plasma Master File must follow evaluation procedure laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 542/95 (1) concerning the examination of variations to the terms of a marketing authorisation falling within the scope of Council regulation (EEC) No 2309/93 of 22 July 1993 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation andsupervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products ( 2). Conditions for the assessment of these changes are laid down by Regulation (EC) No 1085/2003. \u2014 As a second step to the provisions in the first, second, third and fourth indents, the competent authority that will grant or has granted the marketing authorisation shall take into account the certification, re-certification or variation of the Plasma Master File on the concerned medicinalproduct(s). \u2014 By derogation from the provisions of the second indent of the present point (evaluation and certification), where a Plasma Master File corresponds only to blood/plasma-derived medicinalproducts the marketing authorisation of which is restricted to a single Member State, the scientific and technical evaluation of the said Plasma Master File shall be carried out by the national competent authority of that Member State. 1.2.

For those medicinal products the presentation of the Marketing Authorisation application dossier shall fulfil the format requirements as described in Part I of this Annex. Modules 1 to 5 shall apply. For Genetically Modified Organisms deliberate release in the environment, attention shall be paid to the persistence of the Genetically Modified Organisms in the recipient and to the possible replication and/ or modification of the Genetically Modified Organisms when released in the environment. The informationconcerning the environmental risk should appear in the Annex to Module 1. 1. GENE THERAPY MEDICINAL PRODUCTS (HUMAN AND XENOGENEIC) For the purposes of this Annex, gene therapy medicinal product shall mean a product obtained through a set of manufacturing processes aimed at the transfer, to be performed either in vivo or ex vivo, of a prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic gene (i.e. a piece of nucleic acid), to human/animal cells and itssubsequent expression in vivo. The gene transfer involves an expression system contained in a deliverysystem known as a vector, which can be of viral, as well as non-viral origin. The vector can also be included in a human or animal cell. 1.1. Diversity of gene therapy medicinal products a) Gene therapy medicinal products based on allogeneic or xenogeneic cells The vector is ready-prepared and stored before its transfer into the host cells. The cells have been obtained previously and may be processed as a cell bank (bank collection or bank established from procurement of primary cells) with a limited viability. The cells genetically modified by the vector represent an active substance.Additional steps may be carried out in order to obtain the finished product. By essence, such a medicinal product is intended to be administered to a certain number of patients. b) Gene therapy medicinal products using autologous human cells The active substance is a batch of ready-prepared vector stored before its transfer into the autologous cells. Additional steps may be carried out in order to obtain the finished medicinal product. Those products are prepared from cells obtained from an individual patient. The cells are then genetically modified using a ready-prepared vector containing the appropriate gene that has been prepared in advance and that constitutes the active substance. The preparation is re-injected intothe patient and is by definition intended to a single patient. The whole manufacturing process from the collection of the cells from the patient up to the re-injection to the patient shall be considered as one intervention. c) Administration of ready-prepared vectors with inserted (prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic) genetic material The active substance is a batch of ready-prepared vector.Additional steps may be carried out in order to obtain the finished medicinal product. This type of medicinal product is intended to be administered to several patients. Transfer of genetic material may be carried out by direct injection of the ready-prepared vector to the recipients.27.6.2003 EN L 159/89 Official Journal of the European Union 1.2. Specific requirements regarding Module 3 Gene therapy medicinal products include:\u2014 naked nucleic acid \u2014 complex nucleic acid or non viral vectors \u2014 viral vectors\u2014 genetically modified cellsAs for other medicinal products, one can identify the three main elements of the manufacturing process, i.e.: \u2014 starting materials: materials from which the active substance is manufactured such as, gene of interest, expression plasmids, cell banks and virus stocks or non viral vector; \u2014 active substance: recombinant vector, virus, naked or complex plasmids, virus producing cells, in vitro genetically modified cells; \u2014 finished medicinal product: active substance formulated in its final immediate container for the intended medical use. Depending on the type of gene therapy medicinal product, the route of administration and conditions of use may necessitate an ex vivo treatment of the cells of the patient (see 1.1.b). A special attention shall be paid to the following items:a) Information shall be provided on the relevant characteristics of the gene therapy medicinal product including its expression in the target cell population. Information concerning the source,construction, characterisation and verification of the encoding gene sequence including its integrity and stability shall be provided. Apart from therapeutic gene, the complete sequence of other genes, regulatory elements and the vector backbone shall be provided. b) Information concerning the characterisation of the vector used to transfer and deliver the gene shall be provided. This must include its physico-chemical characterisation and/or biological/ immunological characterisation. For medicinal products that utilise a micro-organism such as bacteria or viruses to facilitate gene transfer (biological gene transfer), data on the pathogenesis of the parental strain and on its tropism for specific tissues and cell types as well as the cell cycle-dependence of the interaction shall be provided. For medicinal products that utilise non-biological means to facilitate gene transfer, the physico- chemical properties of the constituents individually and in combination shall be provided. c) The principles for cell banking or seed lot establishment and characterisation shall apply to gene transfer medicinal products as appropriate. d) The source of the cells hosting the recombinant vector shall be provided. The characteristics of the human source such as age, sex, results of microbiological and viral testing, exclusion criteria and country of origin shall be documented. For cells of animal origin, detailed information related to the following items shall be provided: \u2014 Sourcing of the animals \u2014 Animal husbandry and care \u2014 Transgenic animals (methods of creation, characterisation of transgenic cells, nature of the inserted gene) \u2014 Measures to prevent and monitor infections in the source/donor animals\u2014 Testing for infectious agents \u2014 Facilities \u2014 Control of starting and raw materials. Description of cell collection methodology including location, type of tissue, operating process, transportation, storage and traceability as well as controls carried out during the collection process shall be documented.L 159/90 EN 27.6.2003 Official Journal of the European Union e) The evaluation of the viral safety as well as the traceability of the products from the donor to the finished medicinal product, are an essential part of the documentation to be supplied. E.g., the presence of replication competent virus in stocks of non-replication competent viral vectors must be excluded. 2. SOMATIC CELL THERAPY MEDICINAL PRODUCTS (HUMAN AND XENOGENEIC) For the purposes of this Annex, somatic cell therapy medicinal products shall mean the use in humans of autologous (emanating from the patient himself), allogeneic (coming from another human being) orxenogeneic (coming from animals) somatic living cells, the biological characteristics of which have been substantially altered as a result of their manipulation to obtain a therapeutic, diagnostic or preventive effect through metabolic, pharmacological and immunological means. This manipulation includes theexpansion or activation of autologous cell populations ex vivo (e.g., adoptive immuno-therapy), the useof allogeneic and xenogeneic cells associated with medical devices used ex vivo or in vivo (e.g., micro- capsules, intrinsic matrix scaffolds, bio-degradable or not). Specific requirements for cell therapy medicinal products regarding Module 3 Somatic cell therapy medicinal products include:\u2014 Cells manipulated to modify their immunological, metabolic or other functional properties in qualitative or quantitative aspects; \u2014 Cells sorted, selected and manipulated and subsequently undergoing a manufacturing process in order to obtain the finished medicinal product; \u2014 Cells manipulated and combined with non-cellular components (e.g. biological or inert matrixes or medical devices) and exerting the principle intended action in the finished product; \u2014 Autologous cell derivatives expressed in vitro under specific culture conditions; \u2014 Cells genetically modified or otherwise manipulated to express previously unexpressed homologous or non-homologous functional properties. The whole manufacturing process from the collection of the cells from the patient (autologous situation) up to the re-injection to the patient shall be considered as one single intervention. As for other medicinal products, the three elements of the manufacturing process are identified: \u2014 starting materials: materials from which the active substance is manufactured, i.e., organs, tissues, body fluids or cells; \u2014 active substance: manipulated cells, cell lysates, proliferating cells and cells used in conjunction with inert matrixes and medical devices; \u2014 finished medicinal products: active substance formulated in its final immediate container for the intended medical use. a) General information on active substance(s) The active substances of cell therapy medicinal products consist of cells which as a consequence of in vitro processing display prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic properties different from the original physiological and biological one. This section shall describe the type of cells and culture concerned. Tissues, organs or biological fluids from which cells are derived as well as the autologous, allogeneic, or xenogeneic nature of the donation and its geographical origin shall be documented. Collection of the cells, sampling and storage prior further processing shall be detailed. For allogeneic cells, special attention shall be paidto the very first step of the process, which covers selection of donors. The type of manipulation carried out and the physiological function of the cells that are used as active substance shall be provided.27.6.2003 EN L 159/91 Official Journal of the European Union b) Information related to the starting materials of active substance(s) 1. H u m a n s o m a t i c c e l l s Human somatic cell therapy medicinal products are made of a defined number (pool) of viable cells, which are derived from a manufacturing process starting either at the level of organs or tissues retrieved from a human being, or, at the level of a well defined cell bank system where the pool ofcells relies on continuous cell lines. For the purposes of this chapter, active substance shall mean theseed pool of human cells and finished medicinal product shall mean seed pool of human cells formulated for the intended medical use. Starting materials and each step of the manufacturing process shall be fully documented including viral safety aspects. (1) Organs, tissues, body fluids and cells of human origin The characteristics of the human source such as age, sex, microbiological status, exclusion criteria and country of origin shall be documented. Description of sampling including site, type, operating process, pooling, transportation, storage and traceability as well as controls carried out on sampling shall be documented. (2) Cell banking systems Relevant requirements depicted in part I shall apply for the preparation and quality control of cell banking systems. This may essentially be the case for allogeneic or xenogeneic cells. (3) Ancillary materials or ancillary medical devices Information shall be provided on the use of any raw materials (e.g., cytokines, growth factors, culture media) or of possible ancillary products and medical devices e.g., cell sorting devices,biocompatible polymers, matrix, fibres, beads in terms of bio-compatibility, functionality as well asthe risk of infectious agents. 2 . Animal somatic cells (xenogeneic) Detailed information related to the following items shall be provided: \u2014 Sourcing of the animals \u2014 Animal husbandry and care \u2014 Genetically modified animals (methods of creation, characterisation of transgenic cells, nature of the inserted or excised (knock out) gene) \u2014 Measures to prevent and monitor infections in the source/donor animals \u2014 Testing for infectious agents including vertically transmitted micro-organisms (also endogen- ous retro viruses) \u2014 Facilities\u2014 Cell banking systems\u2014 Control of starting and raw materials. a) Information on the manufacturing process of the active substance(s) and the finished product The different steps of the manufacturing process such as organ/tissue dissociation, selection of the cell population of interest, in vitro cell culture, cell transformation either by physico-chemical agents or gene transfer shall be documented.L 159/92 EN 27.6.2003 Official Journal of the European Union b) Characterisation of active substance(s) All of the relevant information on the characterisation of the cell population of interest in terms of identity (species of origin, banding cytogenetics, morphological analysis), purity (adventitious microbial agents and cellular contaminants), potency (defined biological activity), and suitability(karyology and tumorigenicity tests) for the intended medicinal use shall be provided. c) Pharmaceutical development of finished medicinal product Apart from the specific method of administration used (intravenous infusion, site-injection, transplantation surgery), information shall also be provided on the use of possible ancillary medicaldevices (bio-compatible polymers, matrix, fibres, beads) in terms of bio-compatibility and durability. d) Traceability A detailed flow chart shall be provided insuring the traceability of the products from the donor to the finished medicinal product. 3. SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR GENE THERAPY AND SOMATIC CELL THERAPY (HUMAN AND XENOGENEIC) MEDICINAL PRODUCTS REGARDING MODULES 4 AND 5 3.1. Module 4 For gene and somatic cell therapy medicinal products, it is recognised that conventional requirements as laid down in Module 4 for non-clinical testing of medicinal products may not always be appropriate due to unique and diverse structural and biological properties of the products in question, including highdegree of species specificity, subject specificity, immunological barriers and differences in pleiotropic responses. The rationale underpinning the non-clinical development and the criteria used to choose relevant species and models shall be properly captioned in Module 2. It may be necessary to identify or develop new animal models in order to assist in the extrapolation of specific findings on functional endpoints and toxicity to in vivo activity of the products in human beings.The scientific justification for the use of these animal models of disease to support safety and proof ofconcept for efficacy shall be provided. 3.2. Module 5 The efficacy of advanced therapy medicinal products must be demonstrated as described in Module 5. For some products and for some therapeutic indications, however, it may not be possible to perform conventional clinical trials. Any deviation from the existing guidelines shall be justified in Module 2. The clinical development of advanced therapy medicinal products will have some special features owing to the complex and labile nature of the active substances. It requires additional considerations because of issues related to viability, proliferation, migration and differentiation of cells (somatic cell therapy), because of the special clinical circumstances where the products are used or because of the special modeof action through gene expression (somatic gene therapy). Special risks associated with such products arising from potential contamination with infectious agents must be addressed in the application for marketing authorisation for advanced therapy medicinalproducts. Special emphasis should be put on both the early stages of development in one hand, includingthe choice of donors in the case of cell therapy medicinal products, and on the therapeutic intervention as a whole, including the proper handling and administration of the product on the other hand. Furthermore, Module 5 of the application should contain, as relevant, data on the measures to surveying and control of the functions and development of living cells in the recipient, to prevent transmission of infectious agents to the recipient and to minimise any potential risks to public health.27.6.2003 EN L 159/93 Official Journal of the European Union 3.2.1. Human pharmacology and efficacy studies Human pharmacology studies should provide information on the expected mode of action, expected efficacy based on justified end-points, bio-distribution, adequate dose, schedule, and methods ofadministration or modality of use desirable for efficacy studies. Conventional pharmaco-kinetic studies may not be relevant for some advanced therapy products. Sometimes studies in healthy volunteers are not feasible and the establishment of dose and kinetics will be difficult to determine in clinical trials. It is necessary, however, to study the distribution and in vivobehaviour of the product including cell proliferation and long-term function as well as the extent,distribution of the gene product and duration of the desired gene expression. Appropriate tests shall be used and, if necessary, developed for the tracing of the cell product or cell expressing the desired gene in the human body and for the monitoring of the function of the cells that were administered or transfected. The assessment of the efficacy and safety of an advanced therapy medicinal product must include the careful description and evaluation of the therapeutic procedure as a whole, including special ways ofadministration, (such as transfection of cells ex vivo, in vitro manipulation, or use of interventional techniques), and testing of the possible associated regimens (including immuno-suppressive, antiviral, cytotoxic treatment). The whole procedure must be tested in clinical trials and described in the product information. 3.2.2. Safety Safety issues arising from immune response to the medicinal products or to the expressed proteins, immune rejection, immuno-suppression, and breakdown of immuno-isolation devices shall be considered. Certain advanced gene therapy and somatic cell therapy medicinal products (e.g. xenogeneic cell therapy and certain gene transfer products) may contain replication-competent particles and/or infectious agents. The patient may have to be monitored for the development of possible infections and/or their pathologicalsequelae during pre- and/or post-authorisation phases; this surveillance may have to be extended to closecontacts of the patient including health-care workers. The risk of contamination with potentially transmissible agents cannot be totally eliminated in the use of certain somatic cell therapy medicinal products and certain gene transfer medicinal products. The risk can be minimised, however, by appropriate measures as described in Module 3. The measures included in the production process must be complemented with accompanied testing methods, quality control processes and by appropriate surveillance methods that must be described inModule 5. The use of certain advanced somatic cell therapy medicinal products may have to be limited, temporarily or permanently, to establishments that have documented expertise and facilities for assuring a specific follow up of the safety of the patients. A similar approach may be relevant for certain gene therapy medicinal products that are associated with a potential risk of replication-competent infectious agents. The long term monitoring aspects for the development of late complications shall also be considered and addressed in the submission, where relevant.
