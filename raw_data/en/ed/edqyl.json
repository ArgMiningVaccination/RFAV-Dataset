Additionally, it can refer to the period of [drug withdrawal](/wiki/Drug_withdrawal) during which an organism returns to [homeostasis](/wiki/Homeostasis) after long-term use of an addictive substance. [[2]](#cite_note-2) [[3]](#cite_note-3) In [medicine](/wiki/Medicine), detoxification can be achieved by [decontamination of poison ingestion](/wiki/Poison) and the use of [antidotes](/wiki/Antidotes) as well as techniques such as [dialysis](/wiki/Kidney_dialysis) and (in a limited number of cases) [chelation therapy](/wiki/Chelation_therapy). [[4]](#cite_note-4) Many [alternative medicine](/wiki/Alternative_medicine) practitioners promote various types of detoxification such as [detoxification diets](/wiki/Detoxification_(alternative_medicine)). Scientists have described these as a \"waste of and money\". [[5]](#cite_note-5) [[6]](#cite_note-Mayo_Clinic_Website-6) [Sense about Science](/wiki/Sense_about_Science), a UK-based charitable trust, determined that most such dietary \"detox\" claims lack any supporting evidence. [[7]](#cite_note-7) [[8]](#cite_note-8) The liver and kidney are naturally capable of detox, as are intracellular (specifically, inner membrane of mitochondria or in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells) proteins such as [CYP enzymes](/wiki/Cytochrome_P450). In cases of [kidney failure](/wiki/Kidney_failure), the action of the kidneys is mimicked by [dialysis](/wiki/Kidney_dialysis); [kidney](/wiki/Kidney_transplantation) and [liver transplants](/wiki/Liver_transplantation) are also used for kidney and liver failure, respectively. Types[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Detoxification&action=edit\u00a7ion=1)] Alcohol detoxification[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Detoxification&action=edit\u00a7ion=2)] Alcohol detoxification is a process by which a heavy drinker's system is brought back to normal after being [habituated](/wiki/Habituation) to having alcohol in the body continuously for an extended period of substance abuse. Serious alcohol addiction results in a downregulation of [GABA](/wiki/GABA) [neurotransmitter](/wiki/Neurotransmitter) receptors. Precipitous [withdrawal](/wiki/Alcohol_withdrawal) from long-term alcohol addiction without medical management can cause severe health problems and can be fatal. Alcohol detox is not a treatment for [alcoholism](/wiki/Alcoholism). After detoxification, other treatments must be undergone to deal with the underlying addiction that caused alcohol use. Drug detoxification[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Detoxification&action=edit\u00a7ion=3)] Clinicians use drug detoxification to reduce or relieve [withdrawal](/wiki/Drug_withdrawal) symptoms while helping an addicted person adjust to living without drug use; drug detoxification does not aim to treat addiction but rather represents an early step within long-term treatment. Detoxification may be achieved drug-free or may use medications as an aspect of treatment. Often drug detoxification and treatment will occur in a community program that lasts several months and takes place in a residential setting rather than in a medical center. Drug detoxification varies depending on the location of treatment, but most detox centers provide treatment to avoid the symptoms of physical withdrawal from alcohol and from other drugs. Most also incorporate [counseling](/wiki/Counseling) and therapy during detox to help with the consequences of withdrawal. Metabolic detoxification[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Detoxification&action=edit\u00a7ion=4)] An animal's [metabolism](/wiki/Metabolism) can produce harmful substances which it can then make less toxic through [reduction](/wiki/Organic_redox_reaction), [oxidation](/wiki/Oxidation) (collectively known as [redox](/wiki/Redox) reactions), [conjugation](/wiki/Xenobiotic_conjugation) and [excretion](/wiki/Excretion) of molecules from cells or is called [xenobiotic metabolism](/wiki/Xenobiotic_metabolism). [[10]](#cite_note-amigo.geneontology.org-10) [[11]](#cite_note-11) [[12]](#cite_note-12) [[13]](#cite_note-13) well-studied as part of [drug metabolism](/wiki/Drug_metabolism), as they influence the [pharmacokinetics](/wiki/Pharmacokinetics) of a drug in the body. [[17]](#cite_note-17) [[18]](#cite_note-18) [[19]](#cite_note-19) Alternative medicine[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Detoxification&action=edit\u00a7ion=5)] Certain approaches in [alternative medicine](/wiki/Alternative_medicine) claim to remove \"toxins\" from the body through herbal, electrical or electromagnetic treatments. These [toxins](/wiki/Toxin) are undefined and have no scientific basis, [[6]](#cite_note-Mayo_Clinic_Website-6) making the validity of such techniques questionable. There is little evidence for toxic [accumulation](/wiki/Bioaccumulation) in these cases, [[6]](#cite_note-Mayo_Clinic_Website-6) as the [liver](/wiki/Liver) and [kidneys](/wiki/Kidney) automatically detoxify and excrete many toxic materials including [metabolic](/wiki/Metabolism) wastes. Under this theory, if toxins are too rapidly released without being safely eliminated (such as when metabolizing fat that stores toxins), they can damage the body and cause [malaise](/wiki/Malaise). water purification](/wiki/Organisms_used_in_water_purification) [Toxification](/wiki/Toxification) [Johann [edit](/w/index.php?title=Detoxification&action=edit\u00a7ion=7)] [^](#cite_ref-1) [\"detoxification - definition of detoxification by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia\"](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/detoxification).
