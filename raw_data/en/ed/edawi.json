This study aimed to establish the awareness of public sector biomedical health care providers on the use of traditional, complementary and alternative medicines by HIV-infected patients who also used highly active antiretroviral therapy, and to determine whether this was based on patients seen or cases being reported to them. Potential risks of interactions between the prescribed antiretroviral and non-prescribed medication therapies may pose safety and effectiveness issues in patients using both types of treatment. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study, using a researcher administered semi-structured questionnaire, was conducted from June to August 2013 at ten public sector antiretroviral clinics in five regional, three specialised and two district hospitals in eThekwini Health District, South Africa. Questionnaires were administered through face-to face interview to 120 eligible participants consisting of doctors, nurses, pharmacists and post-basic pharmacist assistants in HIV clinical practice. The results are presented as percent or proportion with standard error (SE), or as frequency. Results: Ninety-four respondents completed the questionnaire, yielding a response rate of 78.3 %. Almost half (48/94) were aware of patients using African traditional herbal medic ines, over-the-counter supplements, unnamed complementary Ayurveda medicines and acupuncture. Twenty-three of the 94 respondents (24.4 %) said they had consulted patients who were using both antiretroviral therapy and certain types of non-prescribed medication in the previous three months. Conclusions: Awareness among healthcare providers on patient use of traditional, complementary and alternative medicines was relatively high. Few respondents had seen patients who used mostly African traditional medicines, over-the counter supplements, and negligible complementary Ayurveda medicines and acupuncture, with caution being advised in the interpretation of the former. Further research is needed to investigate communication between healthcare providers and patients in this regard, and levels of acceptance of traditional, complementary and alternative medicines by biomedical health care workers in HIV public sector practice.

This study aimed to establish the awareness of healthcare providers about their HIV-infected patients 'use of traditional, complementary and alternative medicines (TCAM) be- sides other prescribed medication, and to determine whether this was based on patients seen or cases being reported to them. Access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) by all those needing treatment is one of the goals to fight the HIV pandemic in South Africa. At of the end of 2012, two million people were estimated to have access to HAART in the country [1]. With the widespread use of HAART, HIV has been transformed into a complex chronic disease, with patients living lon- ger. While the benefits of antiretroviral therapy (ART) are well established, the development of toxicity is one of the limitations to treatment success [2]. In addition to ART, many HIV infected patients also use complemen- tary and alternative medicines to cope with the disease [3], the extent of which is unknown. Use of herbal therapies in KwaZulu-Natal Province (KZN) was estimated in 2008 to be practiced by 36.6 % of HIV-infected persons prior to starting HAART, at 8.0 % after six months, at 4.1 % after 12 months and 0.6 % after 20 months post initiation [4]. The use of non-prescribed medicines by HIV-infected patients was estimated at 15.6 % in patients on ART in Pretoria, South Africa [5]. In Uganda, patients on HAART for less than four years, and those who experienced antiretro- viral related side-effects, were reported to be more likely to use traditional herbal medicines [6]. According to the World Health Organization, Traditional Medicines include \"diverse health practices, approaches, knowledge and beliefs incorporating plant, animal and/or mineral based medicines, spiritual therapies, manual tech- niques and exercises, applied singularly or in combination to maintain well-being, as well as to treat, diagnose or pre- vent illness [7].\"The organization further defines comple- mentary and alternative medicines as \"abroad set of health care practices that are not part of a country 's own tradition, or not integrated into its dominant health care systems [8].\" However, the lack of disclosure of the use of TCAM to health care providers is a cause of concern, with almost one half of HIV-infected women in the United States using any type of such medication not having discussed its use to their biomedical health care providers [9]. A study at two sites in South Africa reported 15.5 % (15/97) of HIV-infected patients using traditional medicine and anti- retroviral therapy, the majority of whom (92.9 %) chosenot to disclose their use to the public sector biomedical health care providers [10]. Building a doctor-patient rela- tionship, opening health care discussions, and obtaining information are amongst the healthcare providers respon- sibilities towards their patients [11]. Communication be- tween health care providers and patients plays a key role in addressing adverse events [12]. Patients may use TCAM for various reasons, such as to strengthen immunity or improve general well-being, as well as in cases where prescribed medication does not work [13]. However, the potential for direct physical harm is a real challenge, with contra-indications and the negative interactions between some prescribed ART medicines and natural products being described [14]. In the private and public health sectors, doctors play an im- portant role in managing HIV infected patients through partnerships with them, and assistance is needed from nurses, pharmacists, social workers, dieticians and sup- port groups to ensure a holistic management of the pa- tient [15]. In South Africa, the multidisciplinary team caring for HIV-infected patients in the public health sec- tor consists of doctors, nurses, pharmacists and post- basic pharmacist assistants, amongst other health care workers. As part of this holistic management, one of the challenges facing the health care providers is ensuring the safety of ART, which requires full disclosure of pre- scribed medication and other non-prescribed medication therapies used by HIV-infected patients. Challenges brought about by using TCAM in combination with allopathic ART calls for accurate information to be pro- vided by the patient [16]. Many studies have reported on the self-reported use of TCAM by patients, while this study explored the views and experiences of the biomedical healthcare providers. No contact was made with patients and traditional healers who are also healthcare providers. Building on previous work conducted in the eThekwini Health District [15, 16], this study reports on the awareness of public health sector biomedical healthcare providers about patient 'sd i s c l o s u r e of the use of TCAM besides other prescribed medication. This was done in cases seen by four categories of health- care providers among HIV-infected patients attending public health sector antiretroviral clinics. Methods Study design, participants and sites A descriptive cross-sectional study using a researcher ad- ministered semi-structured questionnaire was conducted from June to August 2013 at ten public accredited anti- retroviral clinics within five regional, three specialised and two district hospitals in eThekwini Health district, South Africa. The provincial list of public accredited antiretro- viral sites contained 16 locations in the eThekwini Health District at the time of data collection, with this studyNlooto BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2015) 15:170 Page 2 of 8being conducted in the ten sites where permission was obtained from the relevant gate keepers. Questionnaires were administered through face-to face interview during clinic visit hours to 120 eligible partici- pants, namely: doctors, nurses, pharmacists and post basic pharmacist assistants (PBPA) in HIV clinical practice, who had a minimum of three months work experience in HIV clinical practice. To minimise sampling bias, assuming an expected 10 % prevalence of awareness on the use of TCAM among respondents within a \u00b15 % precision, an estimated sample size of 138 was calculated following a formula described in the literature [17]. The questionnaire was pilot tested prior to data collection, and those partici- pants who agreed to participate were requested to sign consent before being interviewed. This study enrolled 120 eligible participants due to a scarcity of these four categor- ies of biomedical healthcare providers at public antiretro- viral sites. Respondents who did not answer all the questions, due to their unavailability for leave or meeting attendance within the study time frame, were excluded from the final analysis. A group of nine final year phar- macy students administered the questionnaire, which con- sisted of questions on the following five categories: (i) socio-demographic characteristics; (ii) awareness about disclosure of prescribed treatments besides ART and non- prescribed TCAM; (iii) biomedical healthcare providers ' reported cases with HIV-infected patients using both ART and TCAM; (iv) reasons for uses and non-disclosure of in- formation about TCAM by HIV-infected patients; (v) and other pharmacovigilance related information. This was done to establish possible interactions between antiretro- viral medicines and use of TCAM, as described in the South African standard treatment guidelines [18]. Statistical analysis All collected data was entered into Excel and later ana- lysed using the SPSS statistical programme for Windows, version 20. The results are presented as percent orproportion with standard error (SE), and relative error (RE). If the relative standard error was0.50 or greater, the percent was not stable and could not be reported when the number of observed events in a given table cell is less than five. Mean with standard deviation was reported for continuous variables, while categorical variables were described as frequency, with bar graph representation where applicable. Ethics statement This study received ethical approval under reference num- ber SHSEC 030/13 from the School of Health Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal. Permission was sought from Department of Health and hospital management gate- keepers before entering the premises of all surveyed health facilities. Participation in the study was voluntary, and an information sheet form was given to respondents who signed informed consent. All questionnaires were coded to ensure full anonymity of respondents and sites. Results Ninety-four respondents comple ted the questionnaire within the study time frame, yielding a response rate of 78.3 %. Socio-demographic characteristics There were 25 doctors (26.6 %,), 29 nurses (30.9 %), 32 pharmacists (34.1 %) and eight post-basic pharmacist assis- tants (8.5 %). The majority of respondents were female (67/94) and had up to five years of work experience (53/ 94). The overall mean professional experience was 5.9 years (standard deviation \u00b14.4, range 0.4 to 22.0 years). Table 1 presents the socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents. Awareness about disclosure of prescribed treatments besides ART and non-prescribed TCAM Of the 94 respondents, 40 (42.5 %, SE0.078, RE0.001) reported that HIV-infected patients disclosed the use of other prescribed medication besides ART.

In addition, 23 participants (24.4 %) stated that they were familiar with such practices, and had cases with patients using both antiretroviral ther- apy and a few types of TCAM in the three months prior to data collection. Table 2 indicates the number of doc- tors, nurses, pharmacists and post basic pharmacist assistants who reported being aware of the use by HIV patients of other prescribed medication, besides ART, as well as TACM medicines. Figure 1 illustrates the types of TCAM (48/94) listed by respondents as being used by HIV patients. They consisted of certain African traditional herbal medicines, over-the counter supplements, Ayurveda medicines and acupuncture. Biomedical healthcare providers 'reported cases with HIV-infected patients using both ART and TCAM Reported cases with patients who used both ART and TCAM (23/94) consisted of the following medication therapies: (i) Echinaforce\u00ae tablets (3); (ii) unnamed African herbal mixtures (3); (iii) garlic (2); (iv) cancer bush (2); (v) Ayurveda preparations (2); and (xi) acupuncture (1). Reasons for uses and non-disclosure of information about TCAM by HIV-infected patients Healthcare providers were asked to provide one per- ceived main reason why they thought patients resortedto using TCAM, with the results being presented in Fig. 2. The respondents indicated that they thought pa- tients reasons were mainly: boost their immune system (7/23), cultural beliefs of beneficial effects of traditional herbal mixtures (6/23), treatment of gastro-intestinal side-effects, pain and chronic illness (5/23), nutrients (2/23), relief of disease symptoms and improve survival (2/23), and pressure from family members (1/23). Respondents indicated the main reasons they thought for non-disclosure of information about the use of TCAM by HIV patients to biomedical healthcare pro- viders, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Seven of the 94 respon- dents (7.45 %) reported the use of TCAM practices as perceived causes of adverse events. While very few doc- tors (1/94) and pharmacists (1/94) perceived the use of TCAM as main causes of adverse events, none of the nurses and post basic pharmacist assistants listed the use of TCAM as main causes of adverse events. One nurse (1/94) viewed TCAM as alternate causes of adverse events, while one doctor (1/94) and one nurse (1/94) listed OTC supplements as main causes of adverse events. None of the 23 respondents who had seen patients or heard about them in their practice had also associated the use of TCAM with adverse events and probable interactions with prescribed antiretroviral medicines. Discussion Disclosure prevalence of the use of complementary and alternative medicine among HIV-infected women was estimated at 36 % in both pre- and post-HAART eras in the United States [9]. Our findings, of few respondents (24.4 %) having seen patients, or hearing about the use of TCAM and prescribed ART, may be due to the de- cline of self-reported use of herbal medicines by HIV- Table 2 Healthcare workers 'awareness of the use of prescribed and non-prescribed medications by HIV patients Respondent category (No) Aware of patient disclosure of all other prescribed medication Aware of patient use of TCAMCases with patients using both ART and TCAM Doctors (n = 25) Yes 7 (7.45 %), SE (0.052), RE (0.007) 18 (19.15 %), SE (0.087), RE (0.0045)7 (7.45 %), SE (0.052), RE (0.007) No 18 (19.15 %) 7 (7.45 %) 18 (18.08 %) Nurses (n = 29) Yes 15 (15.96 %), SE (.0.068), RE (0.004) 19 (20.21 %), RE %), (0.046), RE (0.0072) No (14.90 %) 10 (10.64 %) 23 (24.47 %) Pharmacists(n = 32) Yes 15 (15.96 %), SE (0.065), RE (0.004) 9 (9.45), SE (0.052), RE (0.005)7 (7.45 %), SE (0.052), RE (0.007) No 18 (19.15 %) 23 (24.47 %) 25 (26.60 %) PB PA (n = 8) Yes 3 (3.19 %), SE (0.165), RE (0.052) 2 (2.13 %), SE (0.051), RE (0.024)3 (3.19 %), SE (0.062), RE (0.019) No 5 (5.32 %) 6 (6.38) 5 (5.32 %) Total (n = 94) Yes 40 48 23 No 54 46 71 Legend: PBPA = post basic pharmacist assistant, TCAM = traditional, complementary and alternative medicines Note: standard error calculated on the proportion of respondents who said yes to the questionNlooto BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2015) 15:170 Page 4 of 8Fig. 1 Types of non-prescribed medication.

However, a relatively high rate of awareness among healthcare providers about the use of African traditional herbal medicines by HIV patients was found when com- pared to another study in Uganda [19]. Regarding the reasons for use and non-disclosure, poor communication between doctors and HIV-infected patients was identified as a contributor to low rates of disclosure of the use of traditional, complementary and traditional medicines by patients to healthcare providers in Uganda [19]. Non-disclosure of the use of herbal medicines to medical doctors was estimated at 92.3 % among HIV patients, who also reported never being asked by their physician about their use of herbal medi- cines in western Uganda [20]. The lack of proper com- munication between patients and health care workers is a real challenge, aggravated by negative perceptions and attitudes of biomedical health care providers towards traditional methods of care [21]. A holistic approach to managing HIV-infected patients was discussed in a focus group with private sector doctors as one of the factors to promote adherence to antiretroviral therapy in the eThekwini Health District, KwaZulu-Natal [15]. This included the need for doctors and other health care workers to encourage the appro- priate use of traditional medicine, provided that continu- ity of antiretroviral therapy and potential drug-herbinteraction monitoring was assured. A greater awareness about the use of traditional, complementary and alterna- tive medicines among healthcare workers requires more accurate information on what happens in real-life with regard to such practices. While a study showed that bio- medical health care providers in Durban antiretroviral clinics admitted the personal use of traditional, comple- mentary, and alternative medicines for various purposes [16], this does not guarantee the safety and effectiveness of such practices in patients on antiretroviral therapy. In Trinidad, an assessment of the acceptance of herbal medicines by physicians revealed that 40.6 % had used this treatment modality [22]. In Alabama and Georgia (USA) non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy was 1.69 times higher in HIV-positive women who used comple- mentary and alternative medicines than among non- users of such practices [23]. Other potential health risks of complementary alternative medicines in HIV patients were discussed in a study in UK, where, besides adher- ence to antiretroviral therapy, serious drug interactions with antiretroviral therapy or adverse effects of the rem- edy used were reported with Echinacea, garlic, St John 's wort and aloe vera [24]. Pharmacovigilance activities among health care workers need to be informed by empirical evidence, based on peo- ple 's activities and sound research. Although perceived causality of adverse events due to the use of traditional, complementary and alternative medicines was very low inFig. 3 Perceived main reasons reported by healthcare pr oviders for non-disclosure of the use of TCAM by HIV- infected patients. Legend: TCAM = traditional, complementary and alternative medicinesNlooto BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2015) 15:170 Page 6 of 8this study, suggesting the difficulty of attributing them to traditional, complementary and alternative medicines; a study in Zimbabwe reported abdominal pain and rash in association with the use of herbal remedies [25]. Occur- rence of at least one or more adverse events related to use/misuse of over-the-counter medication was also re- ported among HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy in Texas, USA [26]. Further traditional, comple- mentary and alternative medicine education for health care workers is an important part of public health promo- tion in poor constrained settings, as has been discussed in developed world [27]. Strengths, limitations and generalizability of the study Although we could not collect the expected response rate of 80 %, a good response rate of 78.3 % was achieved, compared to the 60 % being the goal for most research of this type [28]. Missing information from those participants who could not provide answers to all questions within the study time frame was also a limita- tion. A 100 % response rate may have revealed other types of African traditional herbal medicines and other practices used by patients in conjunction with prescribed antiretroviral therapy. Views and experiences of other healthcare providers such as social workers, psycholo- gists, dieticians and lay counsellors were not assessed despite their being part of a multidisciplinary team caring for HIV patients. No attempt was made to access patients 'medical records, which may have provided other findings in patients seen or cases being reported to healthcare providers. A larger and more inclusive sample may have provided more information on awareness about the use of traditional, complementary and alterna- tive medicines among healthcare workers. The results of this study cannot be assumed to accurately reflect the TCAM practices of patients, and additional studies are needed that obtain information from them in this regard. Findings of this study cannot be generalised to the entire HIV clinical practice. Conclusions Awareness among the biomedical healthcare providers about the use of TCAM by HIV patients was relatively high in the 10 public sector HIV clinics in eThekwini Health District. However, only a few respondents had seen patients who used them, most respondents indicat- ing that they heard about such practices. The types of TCAM used were mainly African traditional medicines and over-the-counter supplements, while the use of complementary Ayurveda medicines and acupuncture practices was reported to be negligible. Regarding the po- tential harm of natural products contributing to adverse events and potential interactions with prescribed antiretro- viral medicines, caution is advised in the interpretation ofour findings due to the few reported cases of patients on using African traditional herbal medicines. Further re- search is needed to investig ate communication between healthcare providers and patients in this regard, and atti- tudes towards the use of traditional, complementary and alternative medicines by biomedical healthcare providers in H I Vp u b l i cs e c t o rp r a c t i c ef o ram o r eh o l i s t i ca p p r o a c ht o HIV management.
