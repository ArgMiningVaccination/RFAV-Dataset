The investigation found the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) clinic had inadequate infection prevention and control practices with wet cupping and micro-needling/derma rolling services. Devices used by the clinic for wet cupping were not properly cleaned and sterilized between clients and single-use micro-needle/derma rollers were reused on multiple clients and there is a risk that clients of the clinic may have been exposed to blood-borne infections. Immediately upon identification of inadequate infection prevention and control practices, York Region Public Health issued a Section 13 order under the Health Protection and Promotion Act to stop the clinic operator from performing services of concern. While the risk to clinic clients who received wet cupping and/or micro-needling/derma rolling services is considered low, as a precaution, York Region Public Health is asking clients who received one or more of these services at this clinic between October 1, 2015 and June 7, 2023, to seek medical follow-up and be tested for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) by their family doctor, nurse practitioner or at a walk-in clinic. Wet cupping procedure on person's back. Close-up of micro-needle roller/derma roller. Cupping is a form of alternative medicine where local suction is created on the skin using special cups. Wet cupping is when cupping is performed after the skin is punctured (for example, with acupuncture needles) and blood and/or body fluids are drawn out. Micro-needle rollers, or derma rollers, are devices with small, fine needles on a roller that are rolled over the face and/or body to create microtears in the skin. During wet cupping and micro-needling/derma rolling procedures, equipment may come into contact with blood and/or body fluids. Public notification of this investigation is being conducted as the clinic had inadequate client documentation practices, and York Region Public Health is not able to follow up with clients directly. As such, there is an inability to follow-up with clients directly.
