Currently the mainstream media is urging everyone, with few exceptions, to get one of the COVID-19 vaccines. People who hesitate or oppose this vaccine are often criticized and even shamed for not doing their part to end the pandemic. As I said, it is a personal decision. But there are some facts that need to be plainly stated. - These vaccines are experimental. - They are being utilized on \"Emergency Use Authorization.\" - No one knows what the long-term effects are. And yet, the CDC on its website leads off with: - \"COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective.\" - In the short-term, they appear to be relatively safe but, I repeat, no one but no one, knows what the long-term effects are. Such a statement by the CDC is misleading. - This week's number of reported adverse events among all age groups following COVID vaccines surpassed 350,000, according to data released today by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The data comes directly from reports submitted to the [Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System](https://vaers.hhs.gov/)(VAERS). [VAERS](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/rfk-jr-david-kessler-covid-vaccine-vaers/)is the primary government-funded system for reporting adverse vaccine reactions in the U.S. Reports submitted to VAERS require further investigation before a causal relationship can be confirmed. Every Friday, [VAERS](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/rfk-jr-david-kessler-covid-vaccine-vaers/)makes public all vaccine injury reports received as of a specified date, usually about a week prior to the release date. - Data released Sept. 17 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showed that between Dec. 14, 2020 and Sept. 17, 2021, a total of 726,965 adverse events following COVID vaccines were reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). The data included a total of 15,386 reports of deaths \u2014 an increase of 461 over the previous week. - In the U.S. 316.1 million COVID vaccine doses had been administered as of June 18. This includes: 131 million doses of Moderna's vaccine, 173 million doses of Pfizer and 12 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) COVID vaccine. - Of the 6,113 deaths reported as of June 18, 23% occurred within 48 hours of vaccination, 16% occurred within 24 hours and 38% occurred in people who became ill within 48 hours of being vaccinated. - This week's data for 12- to 17-year-olds show: - 7,294 total adverse events, including 423 rated as serious and nine reported deaths among 12- to 17-year-olds. Four deaths (or 44%) were cardiac-related and three were sudden, unexplained deaths - CDC is quick to say that just because a person reports a death or adverse reaction it does not mean that the vaccination caused it. Remember, CDC is unabashedly pro-vaccine. They appear intent on not finding a causal link. - CDC is a bit like the fox who guards the henhouse. I say, take their pronouncements with a grain of salt. Or as W.C. Fields once famously said: Trust everybody, but Cut the cards yourself. - Another thing: you should be aware that if you are injured because of one of these vaccines you cannot sue the vaccine makers. With few exceptions, they have been indemnified by the federal government since 1986, that is to say, they have no liability. As far as Big Pharma and their vaccines are concerned: Heads they win, tails they win. - And especially remember this: your chances of dying from COVID-19 are less than 1% unless you are over 65 and have underlying medical conditions. Even in this group, the chances of dying are around 5%. The good news: what you can do to bolster your immune system. I, along with many health professionals, suggest adults take 3,000 to 5,000 units of Vitamin D daily. It is known to have anti-viral effects. Studies have shown that most persons hospitalized with COVID-19 are low in D-3. Also suggested: extra vitamin C, zinc and Quercetin. Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin, when given in the first 5-7 days of coming down with COVID-19, are both highly successful in controlling the coronavirus and avoiding hospitalization. As far as homeopathic treatment is concerned: homeopathic doctors from around the world are treating and having success treating COVID-19 as well as treating adverse effects from the COVID-19 vaccines. Again, the decision is personal. It's up to each one of us to decide. I, for one, will not be taking the vaccine. "}
