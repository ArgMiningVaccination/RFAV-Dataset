Baking, cooking, gingerbread, soup, everything that is warm and yummy is welcome starting November 1st. While I'm dreading snow touching the ground, I'm excited for baking marathons and bringing my herbs indoors. Yes, I have less space in my house now, but it's nice to have thyme, lavender and basil handy in my kitchen. Amongst the holiday insanity and constant cooking, I like to know that my array of herbs leftover from my summer garden won't harm my cats. Because who needs to worry about that amongst the holiday insanity. I've saved myself (and you) the trouble of researching what herbs can be kept on the counter, and which ones in high places. Whether you have a dog or cat, hopefully this list helps during the joyful hectic and chaotic holiday season. Herbs Safe for Dogs These can be kept on the counter. If nibbled, your pet will be fine. Of course, anything eaten in large quantities, by human or animal, is usually bad news. - Basil - Parsley - Thyme - Sage - Cilantro - Dill (in small amounts only) - Rosemary (in small amounts, only) - Lavender (in small amounts, only) Herbs Toxic to Dogs Keep these on top of the fridge, or in another high place. Obviously, cocoa is not tummy friendly, but generally dogs won't seek out your hot chocolate mix, unless there are marshmallows of course. - Mace - Cocoa - Marjoram - Cannabis - Tarragon - Borage - Chamomile - Oregano - Sorrel - Bay Leaf - Epazote - Chives and Scallions - Lemon Verbena and Lemon Grass - Mint (in large quantities) - Garlic (small quantities is ok) Herbs Safe for Cats Cats are serious snackers, especially on green stringy things (yarn, twist ties, houseplants). These herbs are safe for kitties to light munch, but too much of one will most likely lead to a tummy ache and throw up at 3am. - Basil - Sage - Cilantro - Catnip (in small amounts only) - Dandelion - Parsley (in small amounts only) - Thyme - Dill (in small amounts only) - Rosemary - Valerian Root Herbs Toxic to Cats - Oregano - Marjoram - Cocoa - Epazote - Tarragon - Chives and Scallions - Cannabis - Bay Leaf - Borage - Sorrel - Chamomile - Lemon Verbena and Lemon Grass - Lavender (in large quantities) - Mint (in large quantities) Remember to never give your cats copious amount of any herb. I use the ASPCA site for reference to find the toxicity level of all of these herbs; if you need more info about which plants and herbs are pet safe, browse my [other posts](/2017/04/18/five-pet-safe-houseplants/) "}
