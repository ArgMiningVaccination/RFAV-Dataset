This knowledge, transmitted by oral tradition from generation to generation, has been eroding in recent decades due to rapid cultural change.Until now, published reviews about traditional uses of medicinal plants in boreal Canada have focused either onparticular Aboriginal groups or on restricted regions. Here, we present a review of traditional uses of medicinalplants by the Aboriginal people of the entire Canadian boreal forest in order to provide comprehensivedocumentation, identify research gaps, and suggest perspectives for future research. Methods: A review of the literature published in scientific journals, books, theses and reports. Results: A total of 546 medicinal plant taxa used by the Aboriginal people of the Canadian boreal forest were reported in the reviewed literature. These plants were used to treat 28 disease and disorder categories, with the highest number of species being used for gastro-intestinal disorders, followed by musculoskeletal disorders. Herbs were the primary source of medicinal plants, followed by shrubs. The medicinal knowledge of Aboriginal peoples of the western Canadian boreal forest has been given considerably less attention by researchers. Canada is lackingcomprehensive policy on harvesting, conservation and use of medicinal plants. This could be explained by theillusion of an infinite boreal forest, or by the fact that many boreal medicinal plant species are widely distributed. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this review is the most comprehensive to date to reveal the rich traditional medicinal knowledge of Aboriginal peoples of the Canadian boreal forest. Future ethnobotanical research endeavours should focus on documenting the knowledge held by Aboriginal groups that have so far received lessattention, particularly those of the western boreal forest. In addition, several critical issues need to be addressedregarding the legal, ethical and cultural aspects of the conservation of medicinal plant species and the protectionof the associated traditional knowledge. Keywords: Medicinal plants, traditional knowledge, boreal forest, Aboriginal people, Algonquian, Athapaskan, con- servation, management, policy Background Medicinal plants have been used in traditional health care systems since prehistoric times and are still themost important health care source for the vast majorityof the population around the world [e.g. [1-6]]. It is esti-mated that 70-80% of people worldwide rely on tradi-tional herbal medicine to meet their primary health care needs [7,8]. Globally, millions of people rely onmedicinal plants not only for primary health care, but also for income generation and livelihood improvement[8]. Annual sales of herbal-based medicines rangebetween 7.5 billion US$ and 108 billion US$ worldwide,the latter number representing sales of processed medi-cines [9]. In Canada annual market sales of medicinalplants reached 400 million US$ in 2001 [10], and are growing at a pace of 15% annually [11]. Through millennia of trial and error, indigenous peo- ple have gained substantial knowledge of medicinal plants which has been transmitted from generation togeneration as part of oral traditions [12,13].

Hence, properdocumentation of traditional knowledge regarding plantuse, along with conservatio n and sustainable manage- ment of key habitats, could contribute to safeguardingthis heritage [18]. A few studies have attempted to review the use of medicinal plants by the Aboriginal people of Canada,but they focused either on pa rticular Aboriginal groups [e.g. [19]], or on restricted regions [e.g. eastern Canada[20]]. Here we present a review of the traditional use ofmedicinal plants by the Aboriginal peoples of the Cana- dian boreal forest. Furthermore, we provide complemen- tary information on conservation status of medicinalplant species, as well as on policies framing medicinalplant use and traditional knowledge. Finally, we identifygaps in knowledge, and sugge st perspectives for future research. Canada 's Aboriginal People and the Boreal Forest Sometimes called the land of much geography and littlehistory [21], Canada is blessed with an immense forestendowment [22]. The circumboreal forest is the mostextensive terrestrial biome in the world, encompassingsome 14 million km 2and 32% of the Earth' sf o r e s t cover. Thirty percent of this world resource is found inCanada, where it occupies 58% of the nation 'sl a n da r e a comprising taiga ecozones [23]. Cana- da's boreal ecozones of which 4.3 million km2are forested [24]. The boreal forest of Canada is a broad vegetation zone (Figure 1) that stretches from the northern Atlantic coast westward tothe Rocky Mountains, across the southwestern North-west Territories and Yukon. The southern edge bordersthe eastern hardwood forest, abuts the north shores ofthe Great Lakes, and in the west intergrades with the aspen parkland and prairie. The northern edge fades into the tundra. According to the 2006 census [25], there were 1 172 790 Aboriginal people in Canada (including FirstNations, Metis and Inuit), representing ca. 4% of thetotal population. The proportion of Aboriginal people ismuch higher in the boreal zone [26], reaching morethan 30% of the total population in several areas [27]. Aboriginal peoples of the Canadian boreal forest are part of two major linguistic groups [28]: the central andeastern boreal forest is home to peoples of the Algon-quian linguistic group (Mi the Athapaskan linguistic group (Chipewyan,Dene, Gwich 'in, Sekani) i(Figure 1). Canada 's forests have long played an integral role in supporting the lives of Aboriginal people, meeting theirphysical, cultural, spiritual and material needs. Tradi-tional knowledge related to medicinal plants has been instrumental in the survival and wellbeing of Aboriginal people for thousands of years [29]. Unfortunately, thistype of knowledge has been se riously eroding over the past decades [14,29] indicating challenges for restora-tion. The concept of Aboriginal forestry, increasinglyused in recent years [30-33], provides a means to keepindigenous cultures healthy and connected to the land[34-36]. Aboriginal communities possess their own tra- ditional knowledge that contributes to a broader under- standing of native plant species, many of which have yetto be studied by \"western \"scientists. Methods We reviewed scientific studies published in journals,books, theses and reports. Pertinent literature wassearched in different electronic databases (ISI Web of Science, MEDLINE, Science Direct, Scopus, and Goo- gle Scholar) using specific search terms such as \"med- icinal plants \",\"traditional \",\"Aboriginal OR First Nation OR Indigenous OR Indian \",\"boreal \",a n d \"Canada \".W ed on o tc l a i mt oh a v ei n c l u d e de v e r y existing information source about traditional uses ofmedicinal plants, but we rather chose to focus oninformation easily accessible to researchers (available on the internet or through interlibrary loan). We areaware that several Aboriginal communities have endea-voured to record their members 'traditional knowledge related to medicinal plants over the last few decades.However, in most cases, this information has yet to bemade available to outsiders. We reviewed a total of 49 publications that provided information about the use of medicinal plant species to treat various ailments. We only used publications pre- senting first-hand ethnobotanical information. Previouslypublished reviews were consulted but were not includedin the analyses. A master list was produced, showingname(s), part(s) used, use(s), and reference(s) for eachspecies (Additional file 1). Although we focused our search on traditional medic- inal practices of Aboriginal people living in the Cana- dian boreal forest, some of the inventoried plants are distributed partly or entirely outside the boreal forest (e.g., in the temperate forest or in arctic or alpine areas).Large-scale trade networks between different nations areknown to have existed in the past [37], allowing borealpeoples to obtain plants from contiguous areas inexchange for other goods.Uprety et al .Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2012, 8:7 http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/8/1/7Page 2 of 14The precision of botanical identification in this review depended on that from original sources. Latin names and native status (native vs. introduced) were verified inthe Plant Database of the United States Department ofAgriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service[38], the Plant Database of th e Missouri Botanical Gar- den [39], the Flora of North America [40], and theCanadian Vascular Plants Database (VASCAN) [41].Whenever available, subspecies (ssp.) and variety (var.) names are also provided. The currently accepted name is followed by synonyms, when provided in the sourcereferences. In some cases, only the genus was providedin the literature [e.g. [42-44]] and we did not attempt torefine the information to the species level. The Aboriginal plant names mentioned in this review were taken textually from the original sources, wheneverthey were reported. Since North American Aboriginal cultures were based on oral tradition prior to Europeancontact, various spellings exist for the same word. Noselection was done and all variants are provided. Most Aboriginal languages are descriptive and thus the namegiven to a plant often refers to its appearance or func-tion rather than to genetic uniqueness. Identical namesare thus sometimes given to different species, or differ-ent names to the same species. To some extent, theapproach shows similarities with the concept of plantfunctional traits [45]. Traditional plant uses are provided with the name of the Aboriginal group whenever the information wasavailable, and the reference from which the informationwas retrieved. We followed the method proposed byCook [46] to classify plants according to the differentailment categories they help to cure. However, in somecases Cook 's [46] categories were not precise enough and plants were assigned to additional ailment categories. Figure 1 The boreal forest of Canada, and names and approximate locations of Aboriginal peoples discussed in this review . Note that although Metis communities are found in most of Canada, it is the communities from the central provinces that were reported in the studies included in this review.Uprety et al .Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2012, 8:7 http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/8/1/7Page 3 of 14Ethnomedicine of Boreal Canada Traditional medicine among the Aboriginal peoples of the Canadian boreal forest is based on oral traditiontransmitted through several generations [13,47]. It is a cultural phenomenon, dynamic and adaptive, like lan- guage and other cultural manifestations [13]. The holis-tic approach of Aboriginal healing systems involvesspirituality and intimate c onnection with the natural environment [47,48]. It also involves strong communitynetworks of people who participate in the process ofhealing, and who can direct community members topeople who have the knowledge to facilitate healing. Vogel [49] compiled the historical context of Aborigi- nal peoples' medicinal culture and discussed shamanistic and spiritual aspects. Moerman [50-52] published someof the including boreal Canada. Shemluck [53]provided a review of the medicinal uses of species fromthe Asteraceae family by No rth American Aboriginal people. Andre et al. [54] compiled the medicinal knowl- edge of Arctic and Subarctic indigenous people. Ethnomedicine of Eastern and Central Canada Assiniwi [55] and Erichsen-Brown [56] reported uses of medicinal plants by eastern North American Aboriginalpeople. Foster and Duke [57] published a useful fieldguide to the medicinal plants of central and easternNorth America. Arnason et al. [20] reported on some 400 medicinal plants used in traditional health care sys- tems by Aboriginal people of eastern Canada. Only forthe Maritimes, 128 medicinal plant species werereported to be used by Chandler et al. [58]. Medicinalplants knowledge of Aboriginal people from the Mari-times has also been explored by several other research-ers [43,48,59-65]. Youngken [44,66] studied themedicinal knowledge of several groups from the north- eastern United States and Canada and Rousseau [67] worked with the whereas et al. [83] focused onCree territory. The Ojibwa knowledge of medicinalplants has long been a subject of great attention and ithas therefore contributed a lot to the ethnobotany lit-erature of the Central boreal region [47,84-89]. Some ofthese studies were reviewed and compiled by Meeker etal. [19] who provided detailed information about 384 plants used by the Ojibwa ii. Davidson-Hunt et al. [90]provided identification, classification and nomenclature systems for plants used by the Ojibwa. Beresford-Kroe-ger [91] provided some information about traditionalmedicinal uses of tree species found in northeasternNorth America. Ethnomedicine of Western Canada Marles et al. [13] described the traditional use of plantsby Cree, Dene, and M\u00e9tis peoples of Manitoba, Sas-katchewan, and Alberta. This study also partly coveredeastern Canada, and it is the only one to cover M\u00e9tismedicinal culture. Marles [92] also worked with the Chi-pewyan of northern Saskatchewan. Siegfried [93] docu-mented the ethnomedicinal knowledge of the Alberta Cree. Leighton [94,95] and Clavelle [96] studied the Crees of Saskatchewan and Smith [97] reported on med-icinal plant uses by the Sekani of British Columbia. Stu-dies were also conducted with First Nations from theDene group in the western boreal region: the FishermanLake Slave [98] the Prophet River theGwich 'in [99,100] and the Dogrib [101]. Taxonomic Diversity, Growth habit and Parts Used We report on a total of 546 medicinal plant taxa usedby Aboriginal peoples of the Canadian boreal forest(Additional file 1). Although most information wasavailable at the species or even subspecies level, some-times only the genera was provided. Among the mostcommonly Marsh, and Thuja occidentalis L. perms were predominant, with 474 taxa 90families, by Pteridophytes (21 taxa Gymnosperms (21 from Lichens (11 taxa from 4families), and Bryophytes (6 taxa from 2 families) (Fig-ure 2). Well represented Angiosperm families wereAsteraceae (62 species), Salicac eae (16), Polygonaceae (15) and Lamiaceae (13). The prevailing growth habit (sensu [38]) of angiosperms medicinal plant taxa was herb (307species), most likely because they are more abundant( F i g u r e3 ) .T h em o r ea b u n d a n tap l a n ti s ,t h em o r elikely it is to be used. The next dominant growth habitof angiosperm taxa was shrub (86), followed by tree (69)Uprety et al .Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2012, 8:7 http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/8/1/7Page 4 of 14and vine (12). Of the 21 gymnosperm taxa, 19 were trees and 2 were shrubs. All dominant species of angios- perms and gymnosperms of the boreal forest were being used as medicinal plants. Furthermore, forty-nine intro-duced species were part of the native pharmacopoeia(Additional file 1). Almost all plant parts were used to prepare different remedies: roots, rhizomes, stem, bark, leaves, flowers,fruits, young shoots, and who le plants (Additional file 1). The most frequently used plant parts were roots, fol- lowed by leaves, whole plants, fruits, and rhizomes. Ailments Treated and Preparation Methods A total of 28 major ailment categories were treated with medicinal plants (Table 1). Ga stro-intestinal disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, cold, cough and sore throat, injuries, respiratory system disorders, urinary system dis- orders, and dermatological infections were treated with the highest diversity of medicinal plant species (Table 1,Additional file 2). Preparation methods included paste, poultice, juice, decoction, infusion, and chewing the raw plant (Table 2,Additional file 1). The majority of formulations wereprepared as decoction or inf usion (Additional file 1). Some formulations were prepared using combinations of different plants, sometimes as many as 20 substances being combined in one remedy [47]. Some formulationsalso included animal organs or fat [47,85,95]. Properselection of species, parts, as well as preparation andadministration methods are all very important in tradi-tional health care systems [1 7,81]. Medicinal plant use should be carried out under the supervision of a knowl-edgeable person [81], usually an elder [102], as some plants might be poisonous (even lethal, e.g., Cicuta, Figure 2 Frequency of medicinal plant taxa in major taxonomic categories . Figure 3 Frequency of medicinal flowering plant taxa in different growth habits .Table 1 Major ailment categories and taxa reported.

In some Aboriginal medicinal cultures the various processes of healing are connected with ceremonies and rites [47,70]. Those who possess the secret cures some-times think that if they disclose them too freely theherbs will lose their potency [63]. When a plant is col-lected, it is important to leave a small offering (tobacco,matches, tea, rifle or shotgun shells, money, sugar or a prayer) in place of what is taken [17,20,99]. This ritual shows respect for the plant and increases the healingpower of the medicine [20]. The season of collectionand proper storage conditions are considered importantfor the effectiveness of remedies. Plants are usually gath-ered in late summer or early fall, when fully developed[47,58]. In some instances the fertile and sterile plantsare considered separately [47]. When bark is used, it is sometimes collected from the eastern side of the tree [65,70]. When roots are used, the healing power isdeemed stronger in certain portions than in others [47].Medicinal plants harvesting practices are integral to thehealing process, and crucial for resource preservation. Phytochemical and Pharmacological Studies of Boreal Canadian Medicinal Plants The most frequent approach to species selection for phytochemical, pharmacological or antimicrobial analy-sis is by reviewing the ethnobotanical literature. Thishighlights the importance of such studies in westernpharmacognosy. Phytochemical and pharmacologicalstudies investigating medicinal properties of NorthAmerican plant species used to be lacking [20]. How-ever, there was a marked increase in such studies in recent years, pinpointing the active principles of many plants used by Aboriginal peoples of Canada [12]. Exam-ples of such studies are: Chandler and Jones et [110], Lin et and Johns [112-114], et al. [117], Awad et al. [118], Tsao Liu [119], Webster et al. [120], Marles [92]and Martineau et al. [121]. At the species level, Chandler et al. [122,123] high- lighted the correspondence between traditional use andphytochemical and pharmacological properties of Achil- lea millefolium and Tanacetum vulgare , two of the most widely used medicinal plant species in boreal Canada (Additional file 1). Applequist and Moerman [126] in Rhododendron groenlandi- cum and Abies balsamea . Saxena , [130] considered Panax perforatum, Petzke et al. nigrum . Several studies were conducted on the anti-diabetic properties of medicinal plants, as diabetes is a seriousconcern for Aboriginal people of Canada [83,117,135-138]. Most of the scientific research into the anti-diabetic properties of boreal medicinal plants hasbeen done in partnership with Cree communities ofnorthern Quebec. Conservation and Management of Medicinal Plants Conservation and management of traditional medicinal plants is an important issue worldwide, mostly in devel- oping countries where medicinal plants are primary for-est products for rural communities. The nature of theinteractions between traditional practices and local eco-systems can be both positive and negative depending onTable 2 Common forms of preparation methods for remedies made of medicinal plants. Preparation methodDescription Paste Fresh plant parts are crushed to obtain a paste used externally or internally. Poultice Plant parts are crushed to obtain a soft moist mass generally used externally to treat swellings, pain, inflamed or infected body parts. Juice Obtained by squeezing or crushing plant parts and filtering through cloth. Sometimes requires addition of freshwater or other liquid for dilution. Powder Obtained by crushing dried plant parts. Chewing Fresh plant parts are chewed without prior transformation. Infusion Plant parts are plunged in either hot or cold water for several minutes. If hot water is used infusion is taken as a tea. More than one plant species can be used in conjunction. Decoction Plant parts are boiled in water for several minutes and the extract is used. More than one plant species can be used in conjunction.Uprety et al .Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2012, 8:7 http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/8/1/7Page 6 of 14use intensity, intent (for local/personal use or for com- mercial use) and magnitude of exploitation [139]. Plantsshould only be collected in such a manner that ensurestheir continued presence, both in specific collectionlocations and across the landscape [19]. One of the big-gest threats to the survival of medicinal plant species is habitat loss due to infrastructure development, mining, forestry, oil and gas exploitation, and hydro power gen-eration projects [19]. Because many plant species havemedicinal properties, their conservation could foster thepreservation of important h abitats for other species of plants and wildlife. Conservation and management of medicinal plants has been given less attention in Canada than elsewhere, although it has been discussed recently [19,140-143]. Some management issues ha ve been raised related to non-timber forest products (NTFPs), but without specialfocus on medicinal plants [144,145]. The most seriousthreats to boreal plants are habitat loss and fragmenta-tion, climate change, and invasive species [143]. It is notknown whether overexploitation is an issue in borealC a n a d a ,a si ti si ns e v e r a lc o u n t r i e sw o r l d w i d e[ 1 8 ] . According to Westfall and Glickman [140], there is no formal system of accounting for medicinal plant harvest-ing in Canada, and thus little is known about whichplants are being harvested, from where, and in whatq u a n t i t y .I tc o u l db et o ol a t et oa d d r e s sc o n s e r v a t i o nissues as the lack of a proper accounting system doesnot offer an up-to-date portrait of the status and scaleof exploitation of medicinal plants. High pressure from the timber harvesting industry poses severe threats to medicinal plants in boreal Canada, especially to speciesassociated to old-growth forests. An integrated, collaborative approach for sustainable use, conservation and management of medicinal plantsshould be put into place and involve all stakeholders[146]. However, local peculia rities should be taken into account and the role of stakeholders might be different in different locations as the Aboriginal peoples of boreal Canada have different legal relationships with the federaland provincial governments. National level conservationpolicies do not necessarily apply within reserve bound-aries. Furthermore, treaties and agreements between thegovernments and some First Nations have granted thelatter different levels of cont rol over natural resources [147]. Special care has to be given when attributing a legal protection status to a species because of over-harvestingby non Aboriginal people, as it will prevent Aboriginalpeople from using a resource they have been countingon for centuries. Furthermore, small-scale, aboriginal-ledbusinesses based on in situ collection of medicinal plants provide interesting sustainable livelihood options.Special efforts have thus to be made to identifyimportant plant collection areas [148]. Zoning toolscould be especially helpful to decision making [149]. Of the 546 plant species included in this review, only six were listed as imperilled according to the Species atrisk threa- tened. Such a low percentage of species at risk couldprobably be explained by three factors: (1) most borealplants have extensive distr ibutions, (2) the boreal zone has been less impacted by human activities than moresouthern areas, and (3) the plants used by aboriginalpeople tend to be the more common ones. Challenges to Traditional Medicinal Plants Research Aboriginal people of Canada are worried that their knowledge could be stolen by profit-seeking pharmaceu-tical companies without acknowledging or involvingcommunities [143], and without proper compensationbeing given in return. Concerns about the respect ofintellectual property rights thus render most Aboriginal people reluctant to disclose their knowledge to outsiders [151], especially as legal protection is insufficient. Thiscould explain why published ethnobotanical studieswere somewhat less numerous in boreal Canadabetween the 1950s and 1970s (Figure 4). Informal dis-cussions with Cree and Algonquin communities fromNorthern Quebec indeed revealed that Aboriginal peo-ple are cautious in reaction to misguided research prac- tices by academics and government agencies. The historical background where Aboriginal people have suf-fered more inconveniences than they have benefitedfrom European settlement is doubtless contributing to Figure 4 Number of studies included in this review for each decade between 1881 and 2010 .Uprety et al .Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2012, 8:7 http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/8/1/7Page 7 of 14this generalized mistrust [21]. Also important is that land claims have not yet been settled for most Aborigi-nal communities and nations [152,153]. Aboriginal peo-ple would probably be more open to share theirknowledge if they had more power in land governance[154]. In such conditions ethnobotanists face important chal- lenges related to trust building and safeguarding tradi-tional people 's intellectual property rights. Nevertheless, a trustful environment can be favoured by consideringthe following ethical principles [after CNR [142]]: - respect Aboriginal culture and protect sensitiveand confidential information; - ensure that knowledge ownership and project lea- dership resides with Aboriginal people;- share benefits with communities;- contribute to capacity building in Aboriginalcommunities;- take into account and protect the interrelationshipbetween environment, health and culture;- obtain clear and informe d consent from research participants, pay careful attention to ethical andlegal issues, and obtain ethical approval of researchprotocols;- respect Aboriginal and treaty rights. Policy and Institutional Framework Related to Medicinal Plants International Perspective Since its adoption in 1992, the United Nations Conven- tion on Biological Diversity (CBD) has strived to imple-ment its three major goals: conservation of biologicaldiversity, sustainable use of its components, and a fair and equitable sharing of the benefits from the use ofgenetic resources [155]. Although medicinal plants werenot explicitly on the agenda of the various CBD meet-ings, all three goals of the Convention are fully applic- able to medicinal plant resources [156]. According to CBD 's Article 8 (j): Traditional Knowledge, Innovations and Practices, signatories agree to \"respect, preserve and maintain knowledge, innova- tions and practices of indigenous and local commu-nities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for theconservation and sustainable use of biological diver- sity and promote their wider application with the approval and involvement of the holders of suchknowledge, innovations and practices and encourage the equitable sharing of the benefits arising from theutilization of such knowledge innovations andpractices \". Agenda 21 and Forest Principles adopted at the UNConference on Environment and Development(UNCED) identified forest products other than wood(also called non-timber forest products or NTFPs) as animportant area requiring increased attention and as asource of environmentally-sound and sustainable devel-opment [157]. Since the Johannesburg Earth Summit in 2002, much attention has been given to the possibility of combining biodiversity conservation and poverty alle-viation [158]. Via their legislations, countries are obligedto implement these various policy measures to ensurethat traditional knowledge and intellectual propertyrights are respected [159]. The Conference of the Partiesto the Convention on Biological Diversity held inNagoya (Japan) in 2010 discussed the access and benefit sharing issues of sustainable use of biodiversity [160]. The Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights mandates countries to safeguard intel-lectual property rights [159]. The UN Declaration onthe Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Article 24 includesprovisions for use of resources (including medicinalplants) and rights over territories [161]: \"Indigenous peoples have the right to their traditionalmedicines and to maintain their health practices,including the conservation of their vital medicinalplants, animals and minerals. Indigenous individualsalso have the right to access, without any discrimina-tion, to all social and health services \". The World Health Organization (WHO) has drafted several guidelines and passed resolutions for the integra-tion of traditional health care systems and remedies intonational health policies and regulations [8,162-165]. Thespecific guidelines on conservation of medicinal plantsare provided in WHO et al. [165]. Organizations likeWHO, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the WorldConservation Union (IUCN), the UN Food and Agricul-ture Organization (FAO), the wildlife trade monitoring network-TRAFFIC, the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), and Plant Life Internationalhave been involved in the medicinal plants sector for along time [see [8,165,166]]. Various recommendations have been made on the use and conservation of medicinal plants, such as thoseassociated with international conferences at Chiang Mai,Thailand, in 1988, and Bangalore, India, in 1998 and 2009 [18,167]. They included the need for co-ordinated conservation action, based on both in situ and ex situ strategies; inclusion of community and gender perspec-tives in the development of policies and programmes; the need for more information on medicinal plantstrade; establishment of systems for inventorying andmonitoring medicinal plants status; development of sus-tainable harvesting practices; encouragement of micro-Uprety et al .Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2012, 8:7 http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/8/1/7Page 8 of 14enterprise development by indigenous and rural com- munities; and protection of traditional resources and intellectual property rights [18]. The recent InternationalHealers 'Conference on Promotion of Traditional Medi- cine for Sustainable Healthcare [167] called for the pro-motion of self-regulation of all traditional health professions, capacity build ing in local communities to develop biocultural protocols, integration of traditional medicine into national healthcare systems, and establish-ment of a Permanent Forum on Traditional HealthPractices at the United Nations. The regulation of existing markets by setting environ- mental standards for internat ional trade is a traditional instrument advocated by international environmental policy [168]. Biodiversity c onservation oriented trade policy measures are components of international agree- ments (e.g., the listing of species in CITES appendicesand banning of certain species for trade on the interna-tional market). Likewise, the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade (GATT) also regulates biodiversity trade and imposes certain restrictions on internationaltrade of plant resources, including several species of medicinal plants. Existing gu idelines for the sustainable collection of NTFPs provide useful models for medicinal plants, including the Fores t Stewardship Council (FSC) sustainable forest managem ent standard, the Interna- tional Federation and Fairtrade Labelling Organizations Inter-national (FLO) [2]. National Perspective Comprehensive national policy, laws and regulationson traditional medicine do not exist in Canada [10].Nevertheless, Aboriginal and treaty rights are protectedby the constitution of Canada, and this is reflected inforest policy and forest management practices. Cana-da's National Forest Sector Strategy (1988, reviewed and revised in 1992, 1998, 2003 and 2008) included provisions for ensuring rights and participation of Aboriginal people and incorporating traditional knowl-edge, cultural values and practices in managing forestlands [22,169,170]. Involvement of Aboriginal peoplein developing non-timber forest products and the rolethey play in sustainable forest management have beenrecognized [22]. The econo mic development of NTFPs for diversification of the forest industry is one of the important aspects of sustainable management of Cana- da's forest [13]. Canada is also an active participant of multilateral and bilateral international treaties andconventions including Forest Principles and CBDadopted in 1992 in Rio, and CITES [22]; ensuring con-servation and sustainable management of medicinalplants, as well as protection of indigenous knowledge.Canada has recently - although belatedly - ratified theUN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoplesthat reaffirms the country 's commitment to promoting and protecting the rights of Indigenous peoples andtheir resources [171]. Sustainable Forests: A Canadian Commitment pub- lished in 1992 [172] was signed by governments, indus- try, non-governmental organizations, Aboriginal people, and communities. It responded to international initia-tives and commitments, including the UNCED andAgenda 21. The Canadian government has implementedthe Species at Risk Act in 2002 to protect endangeredand threatened species [173]. Equivalent legislations alsoexist at the provincial level [140]. The Natural Health Products Directorate of Health Canada is a governing body for the regulation of plantremedies. The Canadian policy on \"Natural Health Pro- ducts Regulations \"includes herbal medicines among other things and was implemented in 2004 by the Nat-ural Health Products Directorate [174,175]. The pro-gram has identified indigenous medicinal plants andAboriginal contributions and approaches to alternativehealth care as priority research areas [141]. Forest Certification and Aboriginal Medicinal Plants of Canada Forest certification provides important benefits to forest communities and certified forests are increasing in pro-portion since the beginning of the 1990 's. Canada is leading the world in terms of total area of certified for-est and proportion of managed forests that have been certified [176]. Certificati on standards mandate forest companies to protect biodiversity and Aboriginal cul- ture. Specific criteria protect the rights of Aboriginalpeople, ensure preservation of Aboriginal resources, tra-ditional knowledge and land, and compensation of Indi-genous people for the use of their traditional knowledgein forest management [176]. T hese provisions provided by forest certification standards could benefit Aboriginal people by providing opportunities for protecting not only timber, but also non-timber forest values, includingmedicinal plants [177]. Interestingly, certification hasproven equally, or even more effective than legislationto ensure protection of species, habitats and culture, aspressure from the market is often stronger than fromgovernments. Trends, Gaps and Future Directions Ethnobotanical research in the Canadian boreal foresthas so far focused on plant use by Aboriginal peoplefrom the eastern boreal zone. The Mi 'kmaq and Male- cite nations of the Maritimes are among the most stu-died groups [e.g. [43,48,60-65]], along with the Ojibwa/Chippewa [e.g. [47,84-89]. In Quebec, Cree and Innucultures have been given more attention [e.g.Uprety et al .Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2012, 8:7 http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/8/1/7Page 9 of 14[42,70-83]]. The northwestern zone of the boreal forest has received less attention [but see [13,17,54,92-99]. After the 1960s, there has been a shift from ethnobo- tanical studies to phytochemical, antimicrobial pharmacolo- gical studies, ethnobotanical efforts should continue, especially in areas and within nations that have receivedless attention so far, or for which publicly availablematerial is scarce. For example, studies should be con-ducted in the northwestern Canadian boreal forest,notably with the Metis and with peoples of the Athapas-kan language family, as well as with the Naskapi fromnortheastern Quebec. To diversify the scope of ethnobo- tanical studies, new methods should be adopted, for field work as well as for data analysis [e.g. [83,178-182]]. Studies are needed to determine if, for the same active principle and at the same dosage, the efficiency is differ-ent for traditional and western remedies. Possible inter-actions between medicinal plants and western medicineor between different species of medicinal plants alsoneed to be investigated [ 183-185]. Studies are also needed in pharmacognosy, i.e. the standardization,authentication and study of natural drugs [186]. The uti-lization of animal products (alone or in combinationwith plants) to treat ailments has been given far lessattention than medicinal plants, despite major potential[187]. From a governance point of view, gender-based or intergenerational knowledge differences related to med- icinal plant use should be be tter documented. Studies are also needed to determine how traditional medicine could be given a larger place in modern health care sys-tems [188-192]. Policy issues about traditional medicinal practices have not yet been properly addressed in Canada [10]. Therecent adoption of the UN Declaration on the Rights ofIndigenous People could provide incentives in this regard. Canada is also lagging behind in terms of regula- tions about conservation and management of medicinalplants. As suggested by Westfall and Glickman [140],Canada requires an enforceable policy that protects wildmedicinal plants, effective monitoring system for com-mercial harvesting, and policy incentives for the cultiva-tion of medicinal plants in order to reduce harvestingpressure of wild plants. However, harvesting medicinal plants from cultivated fields instead of natural forests might affect spiritual and cer emonial aspects, possibly with reduced medicinal effects [156]. Conclusion Medicinal plants represent a significant contribution tohuman health and one of the most significant ways inwhich humans directly reap the benefits provided bybiodiversity [7,17]. Use of medicinal plants by Aboriginalpeople from the Canadian boreal forest has a long his-tory [11]. Here we reported on 546 medicinal plant spe-cies used in the traditional health care systems ofAboriginal people from the Canadian boreal forest. This is the most comprehensive review to date and it shows striking similarities between medicinal plant uses in dif-ferent nations. Thus, by triangulation, it is probably stillpossible to document most of the knowledge, butresearch should continue, especially in areas or withinnations that have received less attention. Endnotes iOnly the names of the peoples mentioned in this review are provided. The Algonquian and Athapaskanlanguage families include other peoples not listed here.T h en a m e sa r et h o s et h a ta r ec u r r e n t l yi nu s ea n dd i f -ferent names were sometimes provided in the olderliterature. iiAnishinabe is the correct name for this people and it is how they refer to themselves. Ojibwa and Chippewa are names given to them by other tribes or by non- aboriginal people [see [19]]. The Algonquin also callthemselves Anishinabe (or Anicinape) [33].
