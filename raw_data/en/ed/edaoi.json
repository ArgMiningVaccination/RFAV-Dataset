HIV drugs for coronavirus treatment Abbvie's HIV protease inhibitor, lopinavir is being studied along with ritonavir for the treatment of MERS and SARS coronaviruses. The repurposed drug is already approved for the treatment of HIV infection under the trade name Kaletra\u00ae. The combination is listed in the WHO list of essential medicines. Lopinavir is believed to act on the intracellular processes of coronavirus replication and demonstrated reduced mortality in the non-human primates (NHP) model of the MERS. Lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with ribavirin showed reduced fatality rate and milder disease course during an open clinical trial in patients in the 2003 SARS outbreak. Cipla is also reportedly planning to repurpose its HIV drug LOPIMUNE, which is a combination of protease inhibitors Lopinavir and Ritonavir, for the treatment of coronavirus. A licensed generic of Kaletra\u00ae, LOPIMUNE is currently available in packs of 60 tablets each, containing 200mg of Lopinavir and 50mg of Ritonavir. Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, donated its PREZCOBIX\u00ae HIV medication (darunavir/cobicistat) for use in research activities aimed at finding a treatment for COVID-19. Darunavir is a protease inhibitor marketed by Janssen. Anecdotal reports suggest darunavir as potentially having antiviral activity against COVID-19. It is, however, currently approved only for use with a boosting agent, and in combination with other antiretrovirals, for the treatment of HIV-1. Janssen has no in vitro or clinical data to support the use of darunavir as a treatment for COVID-19. The drug is in the process of being evaluated in vitro for any potential activity against the coronavirus. Further, Janssen has partnered with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to expedite the development of a COVID-19 treatment. The Coronavirus outbreak The contagious coronavirus outbreak at the end of 2019, which the WHO named as COVID-19 (formerly 2019-nCoV), led to a medical emergency across the world. Similar infections are caused by human alpha and beta coronaviruses such as 229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1. What are the symptoms? Coronavirus symptoms include those associated with common cold, such as running nose, headache, cough, fever, and sore throat. Coronavirus transmission \"Coronavirus transmission can happen human-to-human as well as from infected animals such as dogs and cats.\" COVID-19 is a betacoronavirus that has origin in bats, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Believed to have transmitted from animals and reptiles such as snakes, coronaviruses cause respiratory issues such as upper respiratory tract illnesses and lower respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchitis. Coronavirus transmission can happen human-to-human as well as from infected animals such as dogs and cats. "}
