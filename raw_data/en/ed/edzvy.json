We break down what destinations might require Managing Physician of Immunization Practices and Travel Medicine. Advising the Traveler: The Pre-travel Consultation The pre-travel consultation is a risk assessment process that provides a guide to prioritize and customize pre-travel health care for individual travelers. The goal of this pre-travel consultation is to effectively and efficiently prepare the traveler with the appropriate information, vaccinations, and medications to help reduce the risk of illness and injury related to travel. Because of the possible need to complete a series of vaccinations, the pre- travel visit ideally should occur 4-6 weeks before travel. Travelers who are not able to seek care during this time, however, will also benefit from visiting a health-care provider, as last-minute vaccinations and travel advice could be useful . Recordkeeping Procedures The designated clinic should observe and maintain high standards of recordkeeping. The minimum entries in a patient record following yellow fever vaccination include the date of vaccine administration, the product name, lot number, expiration date, injection site, and name of the person administering the vaccine. There are additional requirements when completing the International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP). In addition to vaccine-related information, staff should record the general information listed below about the patient. These details should be recorded in either the traveler's permanent medical record, or in situations where no permanent record exists, in an ad hoc medical record. - Date of birth - Relevant medical history (e.g., allergies, prior adverse events, immune status, and medical conditions and treatments) - Destination country (e.g., cities and regions to be visited) For children who receive yellow fever vaccine, vaccination records should be kept according to state health department requirements. For example, records should be documented in the same way as other childhood vaccines. In the event of closure of a designated clinic, patient records should be archived according to official state health department guidance. Planning a safari or a trip to an exotic geographic area? If you're planning a safari or a trip to an exotic geographic area, talk to your doctor about whether or not you should receive the yellow fever vaccination prior to embarking on your voyage. YELLOW FEVER is a severe viral disease that is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes. The disease can be prevented through immunization for most individuals. Travelers to the tropical regions of Africa and parts of South America are recommended to receive yellow fever vaccine. In addition, travelers are urged to take precautions against mosquito bites, including staying indoors at dawn and dusk, wearing DEET-containing insect repellant and insect repellant treated clothing with long sleeves and pants, and using bed nets or sleeping in screened rooms. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the risk of acquiring yellow fever for travelers in Africa is estimated at 50 cases per 100,000 travelers per two-week stay during the peak transmission season, which is July through October. The average risk in off-season is closer to 10 per 100,000 per two-week stay. In South America, the risk is somewhat less. Symptoms and Treatment It can take from three to six days to see signs of illness after contracting yellow fever. Most yellow fever infections are mild, and go undiagnosed, but severe cases can be life-threatening. Symptoms of severe infection include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, vomiting and backache. After a brief recovery period, the infection can lead to shock, bleeding, and kidney and liver failure. Liver failure causes jaundice, which yellows the skin and eyes. (This is how the disease got its name.) Treatment for yellow fever is based on the symptoms present. Rest, fluids and ibuprofen, naproxen, acetaminophen, may relieve symptoms of fever and aching. Aspirin should be avoided. Because international regulations require proof of yellow fever vaccination for travel to certain countries, travelers should get vaccinated for yellow fever before visiting areas where yellow fever occurs. In the United States, the vaccine is given only at designated yellow fever vaccination centers. If you are at continued risk of yellow fever infection, a booster dose is needed every 10 years. Be sure to talk to your doctor about whether or not you should receive the yellow fever vaccine before traveling overseas.

Yellow fever is a viral illness, carried by some species of mosquitoes in Central and South America, and in tropical regions of Africa. A mild attack may have symptoms similar to those of the flu. More severe symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, bleeding, abdominal pains and yellowing of the skin as a result of liver damage. Where Is It? Yellow Fever is a viral disease endemic in the Sub-Saharan Africa and South America. Prevention Tips Your best defense is to avoid mosquito bites altogether, but travelers can reduce their risk of acquiring yellow fever by: - Taking precautions against exposure to mosquitoes when traveling in areas with yellow fever transmission. - Remaining in well-screened or air conditioned areas when possible. - Wearing clothing that adequately covers the arms and legs. - Applying DEET-containing insect repellent to both skin and clothing. - Yellow fever vaccination may be required for entry if you are traveling to, or stopping in a country where the disease exists. Consult with Corona Doctors medical Clinics Travel professionals to determine if your travel itinerary will require you to be immunized for yellow fever. Available Immunizations: Immunization is required in certain countries. The vaccine must be administered at an approved yellow fever vaccination center. Contact your local state health department for the nearest vaccination center. Vaccinees should receive complete International Certificate of vaccination, signed and validated with the center's stamp where the vaccine was given. This certificate is valid 10 days after vaccination and for a subsequent period of 10 years. This certificate should be carried with your passport at all times.

In the developing world, diphtheria is sometimes spread via unpasteurized milk. Polio is a widespread disease in the developing world outside North and South America, which may result in paralysis. Polio is transmitted primarily through food or water contaminated with feces. Prevention Tips You should have your first immunization series against tetanus, diphtheria and polio during childhood. If you're traveling with infants and children, you should discuss their immunization needs, especially if traveling for extended periods of time, which might interrupt your child's normal immunization schedule. Available Immunizations - A booster dose against tetanus and diphtheria is recommended every 10 years, whether traveling abroad or not. - If you have not received the complete primary series, consult your health care professional about completing it.
