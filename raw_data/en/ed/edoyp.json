Wald, MD, and Ellen R. Ahwesh, MA Background: Pertussis is a highly contagious bacterial infection caused by Bordetella pertussis. Before routine vaccination against pertussis was available, most persons were infected during childhood. After widespread vaccination, however, the incidence of pertussis in the United States dropped by more than 95 percent, though localized outbreaks continue to occur. Methods: A multidisciplinary team developed a set of review articles as part of continuing medical education modules in the Teaching Immunization in Medical Education (TIME) Project. The team developed the materials using expert judgment and selected materials from the literature and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The first step was the creation of specific learning objectives that used the spectrum of Bloom's taxonomy, when possible. After the materials were developed, they were pilot-tested and revised. Subsequently they underwent summative evaluation by field-testing the materials with 24 other primary care physicians. Then the materials were reviewed by the CDC and national vaccine experts and revised based on their comments. Results and Conclusions: The efficacy of whole-cell pertussis vaccine is about 70 to 90 percent, though local adverse events are common. Since 1990 several purified, acellular pertussis vaccines have been developed that have one quarter to one half of the common adverse events associated with whole-cell vaccine and have similar efficacy rates. The incidence of pertussis can be further reduced by increasing age-appropriate vaccination rates. (J Am Board Fam Pract 1996;9:422-34.) Historically pertussis (whooping cough) has caused considerable morbidity and mortality in the United States, and before routine vaccination became available, most children were eventually infected by Bordetella pertussis.

Between 192 5 and 1930, 36,013 persons died in the United States of complications from pertussis. More than 1 million cases of pertussis were reported in the United States from 1940 through 1945.1 After pertussis vaccination be\u00ad came widely used in the mid-1940s, the incidence of pertussis dropped by more than 95 percent. Despite this success, however, an epidemic of 6586 cases occurred in 1993 (Figure 1).

The first step in developing the mod\u00ad ules was creating specific learning objectives that used the spectrum of Bloom's taxonomy, when possible. The modules were pilot-tested with 10 primary care physicians and revised based on this evaluation. An independent, primary care, sum\u00ad mative evaluation was conducted by field-testing the materials with 24 primary care physicians not affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh. The materials were then reviewed by CDC experts and revised based on their comments, and subse\u00ad quently reviewed by 2 national vaccine experts and revised based on tlleir comments. Transmission, Communicability, and Incubation Period of Pertussis Transmission of pertussis occurs by respiratory droplets and occasionally by contact with freshly contaminated objects. Pertussis is highly conta\u00ad gious. From 70 to 100 percent of susceptible household members! and 50 to 80 percent of sus\u00ad ceptible school contacts will become infected fol\u00ad lowing exposure to an acute case. Transmission 1990 1994 within medical settings has been documented.2 Infected persons are contagious from 7 days after exposure to 3 weeks after the onset of the parox\u00ad ysmal stage. Adults and adolescents are the pri\u00ad mary source of pertussis infection for infants;3 47 percent of reported cases occur in infants, and most (72 percent) occur in children before tlle age of 5 years.4 Female patients are somewhat more likely than male patients to have clinical symptoms of pertussis. The incubation period ranges from 5 to 21 days and is typically 7 to 10 days. Immunity acquired from pertussis disease lasts for many years and is possibly lifelong. Transplacental immunity wanes rapidly. Bacteriology The cause of pertussis is Bordetella pertussis, an aerobic gram-negative rod. Components (anti\u00ad gens) that are important in the organism's ability to cause disease include (1) a tracheal cytotoxin tllat destroys cilia, making it difficult to clear the thick mucus; (2) a pertussis toxin (also called lym\u00ad phocytosis-promoting factor) that causes lym\u00ad phocytosis, contributes to damage of the cilia, and helps attachment to the respiratory epithe\u00ad lium; (3) filamentous hemagglutinin, which helps the bacteria attach to cilia of the respiratory tract; Pertussis and Pertussis Vaccine 423 on 13 September 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from (4) pertactin (also called 69 kilodalton protein), which also helps bacterial attachment to the cilia; and (5) agglutinogens, which have an uncertain role in pathogenesis. Acellular pertussis vaccines contain one or more of these antigens. Clinical Description Catarrhal Stage In the catarrhal stage, the symptoms of pertussis are similar to those of an upper respiratory tract infection: low-grade fever, lacrimation, conjunc\u00ad tival injection, rhinorrhea, sneezing, cough. Communicability is highest in the catar\u00ad rhal stage, which starts insidiously, lasts I to 2 weeks, and is followed by the paroxysmal stage. Paroxysmal Stage The paroxysmal stage is characterized by parox\u00ad ysms, or bouts, of 5 to 10 rapid coughs during a continuous expiratory effort. Paroxysms are caused by difficulty in expelling thick mucus from the bronchi. Following the paroxysm, an exagger\u00ad ated inspiratory effort can occur through the narrowed glottis, resulting in the characteristic high-pitched whoop. Many infected individuals, particularly infants and adults, do not have the in\u00ad spiratory whoop. During the paroxysm, cyanosis, bulging eyes, lacrimation, salivation, and distention of neck veins commonly occur. Follow\u00ad ing the episode, the patient might vomit, appear apathetic and dazed, and be exhausted. On exami\u00ad nation, subconjunctival hemorrhages and pe\u00ad techiae on the head and neck might be found. The paroxysms are worse at night and occur periodi\u00ad cally at a frequency of about 15 bouts per 24 hours. Between episodes children can appear well. A common laboratory finding during the paroxys\u00ad mal stage is a lymphocytosis of II,OOO/pL or higher. This stage lasts 2 to 6 weeks and is fol\u00ad lowed by the convalescent stage. Convalescent Stage During this gradual recovery stage, the inspiratory whooping and vomiting occur less frequently. This stage lasts for 1 to 3 weeks, although the cough itself can persist for months, and paroxysms can recur with subsequent respiratory infections. Adults and adolescents usually have a mild dis\u00ad ease characterized by a prolonged cough that is often paroxysmal. For instance, in a study of uni\u00ad versity students, the median duration of cough 424 JABFP Nov.-Dec. 1996 Vol. 9 No.6 before evaluation was 21 days, and most (90 per\u00ad cent) had a staccato or paroxysmal cough.5 At least one fifth of adults with a prolonged cough develop serologic evidence of pertussis.() Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis of protracted cough in\u00ad cludes infection with B parape7\"tllssis, B lmmchisep\u00ad tica, viruses (eg, rhino\u00ad virus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and parainfluenza virus) can also cause persistent cough. Most respiratory viruses that cause uncomplicated infection of the upper or lower respiratory tract do not cause protracted symptoms (ie, symptoms lasting longer than 10 days) except for postviral bronchospasm. The differential diagnosis of a protracted cough in infants also includes esophageal reflux are noninfectious causes of protracted cough. Diagnosis A diagnosis of pertussis is often suspected during the paroxysmal stage. The clinical definition of pertussis is a cough illness lasting at least 2 weeks with one of the following: paroxysms of cough, inspiratory whoop, or post-tussive vomiting with\u00ad out other apparent cause (as reported by a health professional).7 Pertussis can be confirmed by lab\u00ad oratory studies or linked epidemiologically to a laboratory-confirmed case. A probable case of pertussis meets the same clinical definition but is not laboratory confirmed or epidemiologically linked to a laboratory-confirmed case.7 Suspected cases of pertussis should be reported promptly to state or local health departments. The diagnosis is confirmed by growing B pe77ltS\u00ad sis on special agar, such as Bordet-Gengou or Regan-Lowe; the organism does not grow well on more common agars or transport media. A cal\u00ad cium alginate or Dacron (not cotton) swab should be used to collect specimens, which should be ob\u00ad tained from the posterior nasopharynx rather than the throat. If the local laboratory is not equipped to isolate B pe17ussis, then Regan-Lowe media can be used for transport to a reference laboratory.

Downloaded from aspirates, although available, lack sensitivity and have variable specificity. Complications of Pertussis Pneumonia and otitis media are common sec\u00ad ondary infections that occur during pertussis. Pneumonia, the most common serious complica\u00ad tion, occurs in about 15 percent of cases4 and is the leading cause of death. Generally, pertussis does not lead to permanent lung damage. Apnea occurs in 40 percent of reported cases.4 Paroxysms of cough can lead to interstitial or subcutaneous and to pneumothorax. the lingual frenulum, and rectal prolapse. The paroxysms and resulting exhaustion, anorexia, and vomiting can lead to dehydration and weight loss. Seizures occur in 2.2 percent of cases and en\u00ad cephalopathy in 0.7 percent of cases.4 Approxi\u00ad mately one third of the patients with enceph\u00ad alopathy die; another one third have permanent brain damage; the remaining one third recover. Encephalopathy is caused by hypoxia or minute cerebral hemorrhages. The hospitalization rate is 43 percent for reported cases of all ages and 69 percent for infants younger than 12 months of age.4 The case fatality rate is 0.6 percent for in\u00ad fants younger than 12 months of age. Treatment Antibiotic therapy can abort or diminish the severity of illness if given in the catarrhal phase, when pertussis is often not suspected. Unfortu\u00ad nately antibiotics have little clinical effect on the paroxysmal phase, although the period of commu\u00ad nicability is shortened. Erythromycin, 50 mg/ kg/d for 14 days, is the drug of choice. Erythro\u00ad mycin eliminates the organism from the naso\u00ad pharynx within 4 days; hence, health care workers can return to work after 5 days of treatment. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is recommended as an alternative for those who cannot take ery\u00ad thromycin, although it is of unproved efficacy. Supportive therapy with supplemental oxygen, intravenous hydration, and proper nutrition might be needed. The use of an oximeter or an apnea monitor is often appropriate. Prophylaxis of Household and Close Contacts All household members and those in close contact with persons with pertussis should receive ery-thromycin (or trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole) for 14 days as prophylaxis, regardless of age and vaccination status. Those in close contact who are younger than 7 years and who have not completed the four-dose primary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine (DTP) should be vaccinated using the accelerated sched\u00ad ule; those who have not received the fifth dose of DTP and have not had a dose of DTP within the previous 3 years should be given a booster dose. Whole-Cell Pertussis Vaccine Whole-cell pertussis vaccine is made from a sus\u00ad pension of killed B pertussis. Generally, it is pro\u00ad duced in combination with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids as DTP. Monovalent pertussis vaccine is available from the Michigan Department of Health (517-335-8120) for the rare situations in which it is needed. Vaccine efficacy, that is, protection from per\u00ad tussis disease, varies depending upon the vaccine, the study design, and how pertussis is defined.8 Estimates of efficacy in the United States are gen\u00ad erally 70 to 90 percent. 1,4 Multiple doses are re\u00ad quired for optimal immunogenicity.8 For in\u00ad stance, efficacy, based on a case definition of a cough of a least 14 days with paroxysms, whoop, or vomiting, is 36 percent after one dose, 49 per\u00ad cent after two doses, and 83 percent after three doses.9 Efficacy wanes with time from vaccina\u00ad tion; there is almost no residual protection 12 years after the last dose. Adverse Events Following Whole-Cell Pertussis Vaccine Whole-cell pertussis vaccine causes the following adverse events, most of which are minor: local\u00ad ized edema at the injection site re\u00ad cipients), fever, drowsiness, and fretfulness. Un\u00ad common adverse events are persistent crying for 1 or more hours following DTP vaccination, an unusual high-pitched cry, seizures, and hypo\u00ad tonic-hyporesponsive episodes.10 Most seizures that occur after DTP vaccination are simple febrile seizures and do not have any permanent sequelae. Acetaminophen, when taken after vac\u00ad cination, reduces the likelihood of fever and is particularly recommended for those with a per\u00ad sonal or family history of seizures. Rates of sys\u00ad temic adverse events following DTP vaccination are shown in Table 1. Pertussis and Pertussis Vaccine 425 on 13 September 2023 by guest.

The possibility of permanent or severe adverse events following whole-cell pertussis vaccination is a subject of intense debate. It is generally ac\u00ad cepted that on rare occasions a few children have anaphylactic reactions to DTP that contraindi\u00ad cate further doses. The possibility of other al\u00ad legedly permanent or serious adverse events is less well-accepted. The controversy stems from the limitations of the available scientific data, negative publicity from the media, the frequency of minor adverse events following whole-cell per\u00ad tussis vaccine, and the frequency of vaccinations. Many of the reports of adverse events are uncon\u00ad trolled case reports or case series, and they could have resulted from temporal coincidence. In the first year of life, DTP is given 3 times. If a child has an illness or injury in the first year of life, there is a 3 in 52 chance, or an approximately 1 in 17 chance, that it will occur within 1 week of the administration of a dose of DTP. Thus, temporal associations that are due to chance alone are quite common. Pertussis vaccination dramatically de-creases both the number of hospitalizations and deaths caused by pertussis; furthermore, it has a cost-to-benefit ratio of I to 11.1.11 The best-known study of neurologic adverse events after DTP is the 19H I National Childhood Encephalopathy Study (NCES) in Britain. The NCES, which is the largest and longest study in the field, concluded that the risk of permanent brain damage following pertussis vaccination was 1 in 330,000 doses and the risk of encephalopathy was 1 in 140,000 doses.12 Griffith, 13 in a scientific and legal reevaluation of the NCES data, chal\u00ad lenged that conclusion, noting that cases of docu\u00ad mented viral meningitis were attributed to DTP vaccine. Accordingly, the 1 in 330,000 figure that was previously cited should no longer be consid\u00ad ered reliable.14 In a recent follow-up study of the NCES data, Miller et al15 found an association be\u00ad tween acute encephalopathy and chronic neuro\u00ad logic damage, regardless of the cause of acute en\u00ad cephalopathy. As the NCES found an association between DTP and acute encephalopathy, Miller et al also found an association between DTP vaccina\u00ad tion and chronic neurologic damage in those who had acute encephalopathy. The findings of this fol\u00ad low-up study have been subject to controversy. In response to controversy about vaccine safety and the need to protect the country from vaccine\u00ad preventable diseases, the United States Congress passed the National Childhood Injury Act in 1986 and the Vaccine Compensation Amend\u00ad ments in 1987. These laws created a federal no\u00ad fault compensation program, developed an excise tax on vaccines to fund the program, and re\u00ad quested a scientific review of possible adverse events from common childhood vaccines. The Institute of Medicine (lOM), an independent sci\u00ad entific organization, conducted the reviews or\u00ad dered by the National Childhood Injury Act, Table 2.

In evaluating possible associations between vaccines and al\u00ad leged adverse outcomes, the 10M committee looked at biological plausibility, reviewed pub\u00ad lished studies, and evaluated the results of those studies in terms of the strength of the evidence offered. The results of the 10M reports are sum\u00ad marized in Table 2. The 10M offered three possible interpreta\u00ad tions of the finding that DTP was associated with chronic neurologic damage in those with acute encephalopathy after DTP vaccinationl7: (1) DTP might cause serious acute ill\u00ad followed by chronic nervous system dys\u00ad function; (2) DTP might trigger such events in those with underlying brain or metabolic ill-nesses; or (3) DTP might cause an acute neuro\u00ad logic illness in a child with an underlying brain or metabolic illness that would itself have led to chronic neurologic dysfunction even if the DTP were not given. The 10M findings on chronic neurologic damage were reviewed by the Na\u00ad tional Vaccine Advisory Committee and the Advi\u00ad sory Committee on Immunization Practices. Both of these groups of scientists concluded that the data are insufficient to know whether DTP causes chronic neurologic damage in those who experienced a temporal association between DTP and an acute neurologic event.

The major component (86 percent) of the Lederle/Takeda vaccine is filamentous hemagglu\u00ad tinin; however, it also contains pertussis toxin, fimbrial agglutinogen, and the pertactin (outer membrane protein). The Connaught/BIKEN vaccine contains pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin in equal proportions.

Most of these trials were sponsored by the National Institute for Allergy and Infec\u00ad tious Diseases or the National Institute of Child llealth and Human Development, and several were published recentlyY,-2H The acellular vac\u00ad cines vary in several respects: (l) the method of in\u00ad activating pertussis toxin, (2) the number of differ\u00ad ent antigens, (3) the amount of each of these antigens, (4) the amount of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, and (5) the amount of adjuvant. Pertussis toxin can be inactivated by genetic means or one of several different chemical methods. All of the acellular vaccines have pertussis toxin, but they vary in the presence or absence of filamentous hemagglutinin, pertactin (outer membrane pro\u00ad tein), and fimbrial agglutinogen (Table 3). The studies differed in their methods as well as in the vaccines tested. Hence, it was difficult to compare the various trials with regard to safety and efficacy rates. Differences in study methods in\u00ad cluded (1) design type, (2) degree of blinding, (3) case definition of pertussis, (4) criteria for confir\u00ad mation of pertussis infection, (5) ethnicity of study population, (6) number of children studied, (7) timing of the vaccine schedule, and (8) manufac\u00ad turer of whole-cell vaccine used for comparison.

Some of the whole-cell vaccines studied are not available in the United States. Seizures, persistent crying, and hypotonic-hy\u00ad poresponsive episodes have been reported after acellular pertussis vaccination. The rates of both mild and moderate-to-severe adverse events are much lower, however, after administration of DTaP than after whole-cell DTP; furthermore, the rates of adverse events are similar for DTaP and pediatric diphtheria and tetanus toxoids (DT) (Tables 4 and 5). The ConnaughtiBIKEN, also called CB-2, acellular pertussis vaccine was licensed in the United States on 31 July 1996 for the first four doses of the routine series to be given at 2,4,6, and 15 to 20 months. Seroconversion rates to pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin are higher (Table 6) and adverse event rates are lower for ConnaughtlBIKEN than for whole-cell vaccine. If readily available, DTaP is recommended be\u00ad cause of the reduced risk of adverse events when compared with DTP. DTaP instead of DTP is strongly recommended for children with a family history of seizures. Schedule and Administration The schedule for DTP is provided in Table 7. Premature infants should be vaccinated with full doses at the appropriate chronological age. Full doses should be used because fractional doses are not as immunogenic as full doses and might not lessen the risk of adverse events. Although five doses of DTP are recommended, persons who re\u00ad ceive their fourth dose on or after their fourth birthday do not need the fifth dose. DTP is ad\u00ad ministered intramuscularly. Persons 7 years of age and older should not re\u00ad ceive whole-cell pertussis vaccine because of the higher incidence of adverse events and the low morbidity of pertussis in older children and adults. One half of older children and adults who receive monovalent whole-cell pertussis vaccine or DTP develop induration at the injection site.31,32 Tetanus and diphtheria toxoids, adult type (Td) should be used for the primary series in persons 7 years of age and older (three doses) and for rou\u00ad tine booster doses every 10 years. Adult Td vac\u00ad cine contains the same quantity of tetanus toxoid as DTP, but only one third as much diphtheria toxoid. Acellular pertussis vaccines have not been licensed for use in adults. Acellular vaccines for children contain a higher dose of diphtheria tox\u00ad oid than is recommended for adults; hence, a new formulation would need to be developed.

Ul\\'E) Gill be llsed interchangeably for the fourth and fifth doses. pertussis vaccine is generally withheld but the de\u00ad cision is made on an individual basis with the par\u00ad ent. The risk of acquiring pertussis needs to be weighed against the risks of another adverse event. If the pertussis component is withheld be\u00ad cause of a contraindication or precaution, then pediatric DT is administered instead, except in the case of true anaphylaxis, in which the diph\u00ad theria and pertussis components are contraindi\u00ad cated. In such cases, skin testing may be done to assess whether tetanus toxoid can be given. Con\u00ad traindications and precautions apply to acellular pertussis vaccines as well as whole-cell vaccine. Many health care providers are overly cautious when interpreting vaccine contraindications.3l,H Local vaccine adverse events, low-to-moderate fevers following previous doses, and a family his\u00ad tory of severe DTP adverse events, mental retar\u00ad dation, seizures, or allergies are not valid con\u00ad traindications. DTP vaccination should be postponed for in\u00ad fants that have an evolving neurologic disorder, unevaluated seizures, or a neurologic event be\u00ad tween doses of pertussis vaccine. Vaccination should be resumed after evaluation and treatment of the condition. Vaccine Liability and Informing Patients about Vaccination Patients should receive information that is easy to understand about the benefits and risks of vacci\u00ad nation. The old, lengthy Vaccine Information Pamphlets have been replaced with new, shorter 430 ]ABFP Nov.-Dec. 1 t)<)6 Vol. t) No. (, Vaccine Information Statements. Since 1 October 1994, all vaccine providers have been required by law to use the Vaccine Information Statements developed by the CDC. The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) was established to award no-fault com\u00ad pensation for specified injuries that are tempo\u00ad rally related to vaccine administration. The VICP is funded by the vaccine excise tax and has greatly reduced the risk of litigation to both providers and vaccine manufacturers; at one time liability concerns were so great that some manufacturers were unwilling to continue production of certain vaccines. Since enactment of the VICP, lawsuits have declined dramatically. Successful litigation has occurred, however, for failure to vaccinate. Two cases have successfully been brought against providers for failure to ad\u00ad minister hepatitis vaccine or hepatitis B immune globulin; other cases are pending for failure to vaccinate against hepatitis B, measles, and Hae\u00ad n10philus injiuenzile type b.3 5 Causes of Pertussis Outbreaks Outbreaks of pertussis continue to occur in the United States despite the availability of pertussis vaccine. Factors leading to outbreaks include high communicability, unrecognized pertussis in adults and adolescents whose immunity has waned, the need for multiple doses to achieve good immunity, and undervaccination. Pertussis is highly commu\u00ad nicable, as shown by secondary household attack rates of70 to 100 percent.36,n on 13 September 2023 by guest.

Pertussis is frequently undiagnosed in adoles\u00ad cents and adults, because their disease symptoms are subclinicaP8,39 and they typically do not have the characteristic inspiratory whoop. The typical symptom in adults is prolonged cough.5 Pertussis can occur in adults because vaccine-induced im\u00ad munity wanes with time,40 leaving many persons unprotected by the time they reach adoles\u00ad cence.38,39 Because pertussis is often undiagnosed in adults, they are a common source of infection for infants3 and contribute to disease transmission during outbreaks that occur in medical facilities.2,32 Most preschool-aged children who develop pertussis are not age-appropriately vaccinated. 3 One study of selected urban areas found the vac\u00ad cination status of most (58 to 90 percent) 2-year\u00ad old children was not up to date.41 Undervaccina\u00ad tion results in decreased protection. For instance, during a pertussis outbreak, the attack rates were 30 percent, 50 percent, and 82 percent, respec\u00ad tively, for those who had received 3 to 5, 1 to 2, and 0 doses of vaccineY Health care providers can have a major role in addressing the problem of undervaccination by preventing missed oppor\u00ad tunities for vaccine administration, giving simul\u00ad taneous vaccinations, and interpreting con\u00ad traindications correctly. Missed opportunities to vaccinate occur when a child is seen by a provider for a reason other than well-child care or vaccinations and the child's vac\u00ad cination status is not addressed. In Rochester, NY, 422 of 515 children (82 percent) had a missed vaccination opportunity; most (64 per\u00ad cent) occurred when vaccines were mistakenly withheld because of mild acute illnesses.42 Simul-taneous vaccine administration is also important in maximizing vaccination opportunities. Many providers are overly cautious in inter\u00ad preting vaccine contraindications.33,43-45 For in\u00ad stance, in Minnesota many physicians (36 per\u00ad cent) would not administer a DTP vaccination to a child who had a febrile reaction of 39.4\u00b0C (102.9\u00b0F) after the last dose even though fever at this level is not considered to be a valid con\u00ad traindication.33 Because of the high morbidity from pertussis in infancy and the need to com\u00ad plete the entire primary series to achieve optimal efficacy, vaccinations should not be delayed un\u00ad less there is a genuine precaution or contraindica\u00ad tion. Using a screening checklist might help. Office Procedures To Improve Vaccination Compliance The most important procedures to improve vac\u00ad cination rates are (1) evaluating the practice's cur\u00ad rent vaccination rates, (2) recognizing problem areas and planning strategies, (3) setting goals, (4) implementing the plan, and (5) providing ongo\u00ad ing feedback to the individual providers about vaccination rates in their own patients. The first step in developing a plan, a step that is frequently overlooked, is evaluating the current vaccination rates of the practice; evaluation is a central tenet of continuous quality improvement. This exercise might uncover vaccination barriers within the clinic. For instance, in one clinic audit the vaccination barriers, in descending order, con\u00ad sisted of gaps in patient attendance at the clinic, missed opportunities to vaccinate, and overly cau\u00ad tious interpretations of contraindications.46 Pertussis and Pertussis Vaccine 431 on 13 September 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from The second step is problem solving and plan\u00ad ning. Physicians and staff can choose from the following strategies to design interventions that are suited for them and their patients. 1. During office visits the staff can routinely check the vaccination status of patients be\u00ad f(Jre the physician sees the patient, either dur\u00ad ing registration (perhaps using a computer) or while the nurse checks the patient's tem\u00ad perature, blood pressure, and heart rate. Col\u00ad ored stickers, checklists, or inked rubber stamps arc practical ways to cOlllmunicate the need for vaccinations. 2. The office can send reminder postcards to in\u00ad form parents about needed vaccinations. 3. The physician can write standing orders to allow nurses to administer routine vaccines without requiring a new order for each pa\u00ad tientY 4. Nurses, not physicians, can administer the vaccmes. 5. The office can provide parents with Personal Health Guides, or well-child care booklets or records, that explain the importance of pre\u00ad ventive Illeasures and contain recording tonns. The Personal Health Guide is part of the Put Prevention into Practice Program for physicians. The program kit includes stickers to communicate the need for vaccine, pre\u00ad vention flow sheets, and reminder postcards. It can be ordered from the Superintendent of Documents, PO Box 371954, Pittsburgh, PA 15250-7954; or by fax (202-512-2250). 6. Staff can use combination vaccines when available to reduce the number of injections that children receive, thereby decreasing dis\u00ad comfort. The third step to improve vaccination rates is setting a goal, including a numerical objective. For instance, f)O percent of 2-year-olds will be fully vaccinated by a specified date. The fourth step is implementation of the plan. Many different strategies will work if vaccina\u00ad tion rates arc monitored bef()re and after the in\u00ad tervention. The final step is monitoring vaccination rates and providing feedback to providers. For in\u00ad stance, the percentage of fully vaccinated 2-year\u00ad olds can be graphed and displayed, allowing +32 JABFP Nov.-Dec.1996 Vol.9No.6 physicians and teams to compare their records. The physician or team that vaccinates the highest percentage of patients can be awarded a prize. The impact of evaluation, competition, and feed\u00ad hack should not be underestimated -they are among the most important changes a practice can make to improve vaccination rates. The Teaching Immunization in Medical Educa\u00ad tion (TIME) Project This article was written as a component of the Teaching Immunization in Medical Education (TIME) Project, a multiyear project guided by a national advisory committee of experts in the fields of immunization and medical education. The project is a collaborative effort of the CDC, A'TPM, and the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. The goal of the project is to enhance the educational preparation of physicians through an innovative curriculum on immunization and vaccine-preventable diseases, thereby influencing the immunization practices of physicians in an ef\u00ad fort to increase vaccination levels.
