A person1s ability and fitness to observe and apply the standards of the accounting profession are to be judged by the board of public accountancy. 3. Board membership. The board consists of five members appointed by the governor from lists of qualified nominees submitted by the certified public accountants and the licensed public accountants in North Dakota. There are four certified public accountants and one licensed public accountant on the board. If there are fewer than twenty-five licensed public accountants in the state, they shall lose representation on the board. Board terms are five years. 4. Compensation of board members. Pursuant to subsection 3 of North Dakota Century Code section 43-02.1-02, each member of the state board of public accountancy shall receive annual compensation determined by the board of eeveR 1\\'!:il!\\ei!!eei 3 f~i~y twelve hundred dollars as compensation for the days, or portions thereof, spent in the discharge of the members duties. 5.

He will then place all the cards in the shoe face down. At a minimum, when the indicator card inserted by the dealer makes its appearance and enough cards have been dealt to complete the hand in progress, the deal ends -and the dealer must begin a new shuffle and again repeat the above-described procedure. 6.

Each separate wager shall not exceed two dollars in the form of chips. A wager of one dollar must be accepted at each table.

The dealer shall bury the first card dealt, that is, place it face down in a discard received pile without showing its face value. All cards used to make a hand are discarded in the same manner. The dealer deals one card face up to each player in order from the dealer's left with the dealer being dealt last, face down.

A player may double-down after splitting~ except on split aces. The eligible organization may determine whether or not to permit insurance betting. That determination must be posted. The player's wager shall be half the player's 13 wager on the player's own hand. If the dealer holds a natural twenty-one, the player wins the insurance wager at the rate of two to one, otherwise the dealer wins the insurance wager. 9. Winning. a. All ties are a standoff, that is, no payoff is made. b. If the dealer has a natural twenty-one, the dealer wins all bets, unless a player also has a natural twenty-one in which case a standoff exists between the dealer and that player's hand. All other players lose. c. If a player has a natural twenty-one, the player wins the player's hand and i~ paid off at a rate of three to two, unless a standoff exists with the dealer or unless the player chooses to double-down. d. If a player busts, that is, the player's count in course of being dealt cards exceeds a count of twenty-one, the player loses the player's bet and the cards are placed in the discard receiver. e. After all players have played their hands, the dealer turns up the dealer's down card and proceeds as follows: (1) If the count is sixteen or under, the dealer must hit, or take one or more cards, until such time as the count exceeds sixteen. (2) If the count exceeds sixteen but does not exceed twenty-one, the dealer must stay, that is, the dealer's hand has ended. If the dealer's hand contains an ace and a count of seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, or twenty can be obtained by including the ace as an eleven, the dealer shall value the dealer's hand as such and must then stay. Wagers are won or lost on an individual hand basis by comparing each separate hand with the dealer's hand. The dealer wins if the dealer's count exceeds that of the player's hand. If less, the player wins. Wagers are paid off at an equal amount. Ties are a standoff. (3) If the dealer busts, the dealer pays off the remaining players at an amount equal to the wager. 10. Posting. The following rules must be posted in a clear, legible manner at each twenty-one table or in such a conspicuous location so that the player at a twenty-one table can readily read such rules.

Organization of electrical board. 1. History and functions. In 1917 legislation was approved which created a state board of electricians. In 1949 the name of the board was changed to the state electrical board. The board is charged with the responsibility to examine applicants and issue licenses to those having the necessary qualifications and knowledge in the laws of electricity and electrical codes. The board has jurisdiction over all electrical installations. Electrical inspectors authorized by the board may condemn installations hazardous to life and property and order electric service to be discontinued. 2. Board membership. The board consists of five members appointed by the governor for terms of five years. Terms are arranged so that one term expires each year. To provide equal representation on the board, one member is selected from the master electricians, one from the journeymen electricians, another from the investor-owned utilities, the fourth must be a consumer member of a rural electric cooperative, and the fifth member represents the public and cannot be directly associated with the electrical industry. 3. Executive director. The executive director has full 4. responsibility for directing and supervising the operation of the department under the direction of the board. Director of inspections. The director of inspections supervises electrical inspectors to carry out an effective inspection program. The director is responsible for reviewing plans and specifications that are submitted on various projects. 59 5. Inspection districts. The state is divided into e:i:EJJ:A.~ seven districts. Each electrical inspector is e:i:eJl\\~ seven districts is attached as an appendix to this chapter -an,a-by this reference is herein incorporated. 6. Inquiries.

Russell Special Assistant Attorney General North Dakota State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors P.O. Box 644 Mandan, North Dakota 58554 Dear Wally: Thank you for your letter of October 18, 1983, submitting for my approval proposed rules and amended rules to Chapters 28-02-02 and 28-02-03 of the North Dakota Administrative Code. I have reviewed the proposed rules along with the proposed amended rules. I have also examined the existing rules of the Engineers and Land Surveyors Board. I have also asked for additional input from the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division as to their earlier objections as to portions of these rules deemed to be anti-competitive. Finally, I have reexamined Section 28-32-02 of the North Dakota Century Code which prohibits the Attorney General from approving any rule as to legality where it exceeds the statutory authority of the agency or is written in a manner which is not concise or easily understandable. As to your proposed amendments to Sections 28-02-03-02, 28-03-01-05(2), (3), 28-03-01-11(1), (4), and 28-03-01-13(4), (5), N.D.A.C., I find that the proposed amended rules do not exceed the statutory authority of the State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors. The rules are written in a manner which is easily 91 understandable and the rules do not repeat or paraphrase the text of the North Dakota Century Code. Accordingly, it is my opinion that when these amended rules are filed in accordance with Section 28-32-03 of the North Dakota Century Code, said rules will have the force and effect of law the first day of the month after the month of publication in the North Dakota Administrative Code. It is my decision to not approve proposed rules Sections 28-02-02-03 and 28-02-02-04, N.D.A.C., and proposed amended rules Sections 28-03-01-05(1), (4), 28-03-01-11(3), and 28-03-01-13(1), (2), (3), N.D.A.C. My specific reasons are set forth as follows: 1. The proposed rules (Sections 28-02-02-03 and 28-02-02-04, N.D.A.C.) are not in proper form as they do not include categories entitled \"General Authority\" and 11Law Implemented.11 2. Section 28-02-02-03(2), N.D.A.C., contains the phrases 11a grade and character satisfactory to the board11 and 11the board may give up to two years credit for formal education.11 It is my opinion that the first phrase is vague and ambiguous lending toward confusion amongst those attempting to determine when an applicant may be qualified to act as a land surveyor. The second phrase provides discretion to the board without any standards as to when such discretion will be exercised. 3. Section 28-03-01-05, N.D.A.C., as to advertising, contains the phrases 11upon the dignity or honor of the profession11 and 11carefully and honestly describe and define one1s ability and practice.11 These phrases are vague and ambiguous as they are not easily understandable and do not provide guidance or notice to engineers and land surveyors as to what they can and cannot do. 4. Section 28-03-01-05(1), N.D.A.C., is drafted so as to suggest that there is some restriction as to the media available to a land surveyor or engineer in conducting advertising. This is a subject the board should avoid. Furthermore, the phrase 11advertising should be free of any factor or circumstance that would bring disrepute to the profession11 is vague and ambiguous and does not provide guidance to land surveyors or engineers who wish to be in compliance with these rules but do not know what is or is not allowed. 5. Section 28-03-01-05(4), N.D.A.C., prohibits advertising which 11wi 11 avoid any act tending to promote one 1 s own interest at the expense of the dignity and standing of the profession.11 This phrase is vague and ambiguous and provides little guidance to land surveyors or engineers in their advertising. 6. Section 28-03-01-11(3), N.D.A.C., continues to restrict and interfere with salaries paid to engineers and land surveyors. This is a subject which the board should avoid. 92 I I I 7. Section 28-03-01-13, N.D.A.C., continues to prohibit supplantation, restrict political contributions to political parties or candidates, and prohibit a contingent fee engagement by the engineer or land surveyor. These rules continue to be anti-competitive and, in the case of restrictions on political contributions, beyond the authority of the Board of Land Surveyors and Engineers. With respect to Sections 28-03-01-05, 28-03-01-11(3), and 28-03-01-13(1), (2), (3), N.D.A.C., I repeat my earlier conclusion of August 11, 1983, that these administrative rules as they currently exist are anti-competitive. I requested that these rules be repealed, but that action has not occurred. As such, I have no other choice but to formally withdraw the earlier opinions of this office approving said rules as to their legality. Pursuant to Section 28-32-03, N.D.C.C., it is my opinion that these particular rules no longer have the force and effect of law and no longer may appear in the North Dakota Administrative Code. Notification as to the action I have just taken will be forwarded to Jay Buringrud at the Legislative Council and to the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice. Sincerely, Robert 0. Wefald 28-02-03-02. Examination, registration, and renewal fees. 1.

Routine maintenance and repair does not require submission of plans and specifications. History: Amended effective January 1, 1984. of wells. 1. Relation to sources of contamination. Determination of minimum lateral distances of a well from potential sources of contamination, involves evaluation of the character and location of the sources of contamination, types of geologic formations, depth to the aquifer, effect on ground water movement by well pumping, and possibilities of flooding of the site by surface waters. Based on experience, accepted m1n1mum lateral distances for some common sources of pollution with respect to a well have been established. The lack of specific distances for other possible sources of contamination such as refuse disposal sites, excavations, waste treatment facilities, buried oil and gasoline storage tanks, improperly constructed wells and cisterns, etc., does not minimize their potential hazards. 118 I I The site should be on high ground and be: a. At least one hundred feet [30.48 meters] (fifty feet [15.24 meters] for private wells) from privy pits, cesspools, septic tanks, eewe~e 7 absorption fields, barnyards, feedlots, high water marks of lakes, streams, sloughs, ponds, etc., when well is constructed in unconsolidated soils with filtering properties. b. At least thirty feet least ten feet [3.05 meters] from basements or pits. d. At least twenty feet [6.1 meters] from overhead powerlines and other hazardous devices. Note North Dakota Administrative Code section 24-02-01-03. Greater distances are always preferable and often necessary, depending upon soil conditions. When wells are constructed in consolidated formations, care must be taken in locating the wells as pollutants have traveled great distances in such formations. 119 2. Relation to buildings. When a well must be located adjacent to a building, it shall be located so that the centerline of the well extended vertically will clear any projection from the building by not less than two feet [60.96 centimeters]. Every well shall be reasonably accessible for proper repair, cleaning, testing, inspection, or other attention as may be necessary. The well casing shall not extend through nor shall the top of the well casing or any other well e~eR:i::R~s sfia:l:3: Re~ opening terminate in the basement of any building or in a pit, room, or other space which is below ground surface.

Wells shall be designed to seal off formations that are or may be contaminated or undesirable. Wells constructed in unconsolidated formations with stable overburdens cannot be expected to form a continuous contact seal. Unless approved otherwise by the department, eR shall be filled with eeH.e~e~e ~~e~~ e~ neat cement grout or other approved material at least one and one-half inches [3.81 centimeters] in thickness to a depth of not less than ~eR twenty feet [~~es 6.1 meters]. Wells with a depth of twenty feet [6.1 meters] or less shall be grouted from the top of the well screen. Greater depths are preferable and may be required for specific installations as determined by review of the plans and casing may, when conditions warrant, be installed without grouting. 2. Required protection for various sources. a. Gravel wall wells. The gravel used shall be free of foreign material, properly sized, washed, and then disinfected prior to or during placement. Where gravel refill pipes are used, their upper terminal shall be incorporated within the pump foundation and terminated 120 I I I I b. with screwed or welded caps at least thirteen inches [33.02 centimeters] above the pumphouse floor or concrete apron. The outer casing or drill hole shall be of such diameter as to provide a minimum of one and one-half inches [3.81 centimeters] of grout around the gravel refill pipes when installed in the grouted annular opening. Provisions for prevention of leakage of grout into the gravel pack or screen shall be provided. Radial collector. wells. The location of all caisson construction joints and porthole assemblies shall be indicated. The caisson wall shall be substantially reinforced. Radial collectors shall be in areas and at depths approved by the department. Provisions shall be made to assure minimum vertical rise. The top of the caisson shall be covered with a watertight floor. All openings in the floor shall be curbed and protected from entrance of foreign material. Pump discharge piping shall not be placed through caisson walls. c. Dug or bored wells. Dug or bored wells shall be developed only where geological conditions preclude the development of a satisfactory drilled well. Every dug or bored well shall have a continuous watertight lining of steel casing or concrete. The lining in the producing zone shall readily admit water and shall be structurally sound to withstand external pressures. The open space between the excavation and the installed lining shall be sealed with cement grout or other approved materials. The watertight lining shall extend at least eight inches [20.32 centimeters] above finished ground surface. A cover slab at least four inches [10.16 centimeters] thick, adequately reinforced and having a diameter sufficient to overlap the lining by two inches [5.08 centimeters] shall be provided. The slab shall be constructed without joints. The top of the slab shall be sloped to drain to all sides and a watertight joint made where the slab rests on the well lining using cement mortar or a mastic compound. A manhole, if installed, shall be provided with a curb cast in the slab and extending at least four to six inches [10.16 to 15.24 centimeters] above the slab. The manhole shall have a watertight overlapping cover extending down around the curb by at least two inches [5.08 centimeters]. 121 Adequate sized pipe sleeve or sleeves shall be cast in place in the slab to accommodate the type of pump or pump piping proposed for the well. d. Infiltration wells. Infiltration wells may be considered where geological conditions preclude possibility of developing an acceptable drilled well. The area aroand the well shall be under the control of the water purveyor for a distance acceptable to or required by the department. The flow in the lines shall be by gravity to a collecting well. The water shall be continuously chlorinated to assure bacterial purity. e. Flowing wells. in compliance 61-20. The construction of flowing wells shall be with North Dakota Century Code chapter The construction of flowing wells shall be such that the flow from them can be controlled. The drill hole shall extend into, but not through, the confining bed. A protective casing shall be installed, and the annular space grouted to form a tight seal. The grout should extend upward from within five feet [1.52 centimeters] of the top of the aquifer to the ground surface. After the grout has set, the drill hole may be extended into the artesian formation. An inner casing shall be required where erosion of the confining bed by the flowing water will occur. This inner casing shall be joined in a watertight manner to the protective casing. Flow control should consist of valved pipe connections, watertight pump connections, or receiving reservoirs set at an elevation corresponding to the artesian head. f. Existing wells. The department shall be consulted for requirements concerning the reconstruction of existing wells. History: Amended effective January 1, 1984.

History: Effective July 1, 1984. payments. 249 1. Except for intermediate care facilities for the developmentally disabled, payment rate limits will be established for services, room, and board. 2. Interim rates based on budgeted data, as approved, will be used for payment of services during the year. 3. Room and board rates will be established by the department at a rate no higher than the maximum supplemental security income payment less twenty-five dollars for the personal incidental expenses of the resident, plus the average dollar value of food stamps to the eligible clientele in the facility. 4. In residential facilities where rental assistance is available to individual residents or the facility, the rate for room costs chargeable to individual residents will be established by the governmental unit providing the subsidy. 5. In residential facilities where energy assistance program benefits are available to individual residents or the facility, room and board rates will be reduced to reflect the average annual dollar value of such benefits. 6. Income from client production must be \u00b7applied to client wages and the cost of production. The department will not participate in the gains or losses associated with client production conducted pursuant to the applicable provision of 29 CFR 525. 7. The final rate established is payment of all allowable, reasonable, and actual costs for all elements necessary to the delivery of a basic service to eligible clients subject to limitations and cost offsets of this chapter. 8. No payments may be solicited or received by a provider from a client or any other person to supplement the final rate of r.eimbursement. 9. The rate of reimbursement established must be no greater than the rate charged to a private payor for the same or similar service. 10. Providers, as a condition of eligibility for reimbursement for the cost of services for developmentally disabled persons, must accept, as payment in full, sums paid in accordance with the final rate of reimbursement. 11. The department will determine interim and final rates of reimbursement for continuing contract providers based upon cost data from the: a. Submission requirements of section 75-04-05-02; and 250 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I b. Field and desk audits. 12. Rates of continuing contract providers will be based upon ninety-five percent of the rated occupancy established by licensure or actual occupancy, whichever is greater. A daily census report must be maintained by the provider. 13. The rate of reimbursement for initial contract providers shall be established by review of cost reports: a. To establish an initial interim rate; b. Upon completion of one hundred eighty days of provider operation to establish an interim rate; and c.

Payments to initial contract providers will be disbursed in equal monthly installments for the duration of the initial contract period. 15. The rate of payment will be sufficient to provide for the conversion of the initial contract provider to a reimbursement schedule upon completion of the initial twelve months of operation. 16. The initial contract provider must project the anticipated units of service, subject to the approval of the department, which will be used in establishing the rate of reimbursement for the purpose of determining monthly payments. 17. If vacancies continue to exist sixty days after the date of occupancy, the department may notify the initial contract provider of its intent to place developmentally disabled persons into those vacancies. The provider must, within ten days of such notification, either demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the department, that the department should not invoke its authority under this provision, or accept referred clients. 18.

A provider may appeal a decision by requesting a fair hearing within thirty days after mailing of the rate notification or the written notice of the decision on a request for reconsideration of the rate. History: Effective July 1, 1984. Reported allowable costs will be included in determining the interim and final rate. The method of finalizing the reimbursement rate per unit will be through the use of the retrospective ratesetting system. 1. Retrospective ratesetting requires that an interim rate be established prior to the year in which it will be effective. The determination of a final rate for all services begins with the reported cost of the providers operations for the previous fiscal year~ Once it has been determined that reported costs are allowable, reasonable, and client-related, those costs are compared to the reimbursements received through the interim rate. 2. Settlements will be made through a rate reduction or refund to the department for an overpayment, or an additional payment to the provider for an underpayment. 3. Limitations. a. The department will accumulate and analyze statistics on costs incurred by providers. These statistics may be used to establish reasonable ceiling limitations for efficiency and economy based on a determination of the standards of operations necessary for efficient delivery of needed services. These limitations may be established on the basis of cost of comparable facilities and services and may be applied as ceilings on the overall costs, on the costs of providing services, or on the costs of specific areas of operations. The department may implement such ceilings at any time, based upon the statistics available, or as required by guidelines, regulations, or statutes concerning title XIX of the Social Security Act. b. Providers, to maintain reasonable rates of reimbursement, must deliver units of service at or near their rated capacity. Upon a finding by the department that an excess idle capacity exists and has existed, the cost of which is borne by the department, the provider will be notified of 252 I I I I I I I I I I I I I the department's intention to reduce the level of state financial part1cipation or invoke the cancellation provisions of the provider agreement. The provider must, within ten days of such notification, demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the department, that the department should not invoke its authority under this provision, or accept the department's finding. c. Providers will not be reimbursed for services, rendered to clients, which exceed the rated occupancy of any facility as established by a fire prevention authority. d. Providers of residential services must offer services to each resident three hundred and sixty-five days per year except for leap years in which three hundred and sixty-six days must be offered. Costs and budget data must be reported on this basis and rates of reimbursement will be established on the same basis. Providers will not be reimbursed for those days in which services are not offered to residents. e. Providers of day services must offer services to each client two hundred and sixty days per year except for leap years in which two hundred and sixty-one days may be offered. Costs and budget data must be reported on this basis and rates of reimbursement will be established on the same basis. Providers will not be reimbursed for those days services are not offered to the clients. State recognized holidays will be treated as days in which services are offered. f. Services exempted from the application of subdivisions d and e are: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) g. (1) Emergency services. Respite care. Extended respite care. Infant evaluation. Vocational evaluation. Family subsidy. Days of services in facilities subject to the application of subdivision d must be provided for a minimum of three hundred and thirty-five days per year per resident. A reduction of payment to the provider in an amount equal to the rate times the number of days of service less than the minimum will be made unless the regional developmental disability 253 coordinator determines that a failure to meet the minimum was justified. (2) Days of services in facilities subject to the application of subdivision e must be provided for a minimum of two hundred and forty days per year per client. A reduction of payment to the provider in an amount equal to the rate times the number of days of service less than the minimum will be made unless the regional developmental disability coordinator determines that a failure to meet the minimum was justified. (3) For purposes of this subdivision, the fiscal year of the facility will be used, and all days before the admission, or after the discharge of the resident or client will be counted towards meeting the minimum. h. Salary and fringe benefit cost limits, governing the level of state financial participation, may be established by the department by calculating: (1) Comparable salaries and benefits for comparable positions, by program size and numbers served, and programs in and out of state; (2) Comparable salaries and benefits for comparable positions in state government; (3) Comparable salaries and benefits for comparable positions in the community served by the provider; or (4) Data from paragraphs 1, combination. 2, and 3, taken in By using private funds, providers may establish higher salaries and benefit levels than those established by the department. History: Effective July 1, 1984. Report. 1. The cost report provides for the identification of the allowable expenditures and basic services subject to reimbursement by the department. Where costs are incurred solely for a basic service, the costs must be assigned directly to that basic service. Where costs are incurred jointly for two or more basic services, the costs will be allocated as follows: 254 I I I I I I I I. I I I I I a. Personnel. The total cost of all staff identified in payroll records must be listed by position title and distributed to basic services subject the the approval of staff client ratios by the department. Time studies may be performed for one week at least quarterly for allocation. Where no time studies exist, the applicable units must be used for allocation. b. Fringe benefits. The cost of fringe benefits must be allocated to basic services based on the ratio of the basic service personnel costs to total personnel costs. Personnel costs on which no fringe benefits are paid will be excluded. c. Equipment. The total cost of all equipment, whether rented, leased, purchased, or depreciated, must be distributed to basic service based on usage or applicable units. d. Real property expense. The total of all property costs, whether rented, leased, purchased, or depreciated, must be allocated based on direct square footage. Where multiple usage of direct use area occurs, the allocation will first be done by square footage and then by applicable units. e. Travel. The total of all unassigned travel costs, which must not exceed the state rate of reimbursement, must be included in administrative costs. f. Supplies. The tota 1 of a 11 unassigned supply costs must be included with administrative costs. g. Food services. allocated based on meals served has must be used. The total of all food costs should be meals served. Where the number of not been identified, applicable units h. Insurance and bonds. The total of all such costs except insurance costs representing real property expense must be included as admininstrative costs. i. Contractual services. The tota 1 of a 11 contractua 1 costs must be allocated based upon applicable units or, if appropriate, included as part of the administrative costs. j. Administrative costs. Administrative costs must be allocated to the basic service costs based upon the ratio of the basic service costs to total cost excluding administrative costs. 2. Identification of the means of financing is to be as follows: 255 a. Budget reports require the disclosure of all revenues currently used to finance costs and those estimated to finance future costs, inclusive of the provider's estimate of state financial participation. b. Revenues must be distributed on the appropriate budget report by program. Where private contributions are used to supplement or enrich services, the sum may be distributed accordingly. Where contributions are held in reserve for special purposes, it may be described by narrative. c. The department may determine that the provider is including costs which are more appropriately financed from another source. Upon a finding by the department that available alternative sources of financing exists, but are not used, reimbursement may be reduced subject to notification of the provider thirty days in advance of the imposition of the reduction. d. The disclosure of contract income and production costs is required to establish a rate of reimbursement supplemental to, and not duplicative of, these revenues and costs. e. State financial participation in the habilitative costs associated with production activities where contract income is realized shall not exceed the percentage difference between the mean productivity of the clients, as determined pursuant to 29 CFR 525, and one hundred percent. History: Effective July 1, to cost and cost limitation. 1. Providers under contract with the department to provide services to developmentally disabled persons must submit no less than annually, a statement of costs, both current and estimated, on the cost report. 2. Providers must disclose all costs and all revenues. 3. Providers must identify income to offset costs where applicable in order that state financial participation not supplant or duplicate other funding sources. These sources, and the cost to be offset, must include, but ar~ not limited to, the following: 256 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I a. Fees, the cost of the service or time for which the fee was imposed excluding those fees based on cost as established by the department. b. Insurance recoveries income, costs reported in the current year to the extent of costs allowed in the prior or current year for that loss. c. Purchase discounts, costs of items or services discounted. d. Rebates and refunds, cost of items or services reduced in cost. e. Rental income, cost of space in facilities or for equipment included in the rate of reimbursement. f. Telephone and telegraph income from clients, staff, or guests, cost of the service. g. Rental assistance or subsidy when not reported as third party income, total costs. h. Interest or investment income, interest expense. i. Medical payments, cost of medical services included in the rate of reimbursement as appropriate. j. Respite care income when received for a reserved bed, room, board, and staff costs. k. Other income to the provider from local, state, or federal units of government may be determined by the department to be an offset to cost. 4. Payments to a provider by its vendor will be considered as discounts, refunds, or rebates in determining allowable costs under the program even though these payments may be treated as 11contributions11 or 11unrestricted grants11 by the provider and the vendor. However, such payments may represent a true donation or grant, and as such will not be offset against costs. Examples include, but are not limited to, when: a. Payments are made by a vendor in response to building or other fundraising campaigns in which communitywide contributions are solicited. b. Payments are in addition to discounts, refunds, or rebates, which have been customarily allowed under arrangements between the provider and the vendor. c. The volume or value of purchases is so nominal that no relationship to the contribution can be inferred. 257 d. The contributor is not engaged in business with the provider or a facility related to the provider. 5. Where an owner or other official of a provider directly receives from a vendor monetary payments or goods or services for the owner's or official's own personal use as a result of the provider's purchases from the vendor, the value of such payments, goods, or services constitutes a type of refund or rebate and must be applied as a reduction of the provider's costs for goods or services purchased from the vendor. 6. Where the purchasing function for a provider is performed by a central unit or organization, all discounts, allowances, refunds, and rebates should be credited to the costs of the provider in accordance with the instructions above. These should not be treated as income of the central purchasing function or used to reduce the administrative costs of that function. Such administrative costs are, however, properly allocable to the facilities serviced by the central purchasing function. 7. Purchase discounts, allowances, refunds, and rebates are reductions of the cost of whatever was purchased. They should be used to reduce the specific costs to which they apply. If possible, they should accrue to the period to which they apply. If not, they will reduce expenses in the period in which they are received. The reduction to expense for supplies or services must be used to reduce the total cost of the goods or services for all clients without regard to whether the goods or supplies are designated for all clients or a specific group. a. \"Purchase discounts11 include cash discounts, trade, and quantity discounts. 11Cash discount\" is for prepaying or paying within a certain time of receipt of invoice. 11Trade discount11 is a reduction of cost granted certain customers. \"Quantity discounts11 are reductions of price because of the size of the order. b. Allowances are reductions granted or accepted by the creditor for damage, delay, shortage, imperfection, or other cause, excluding discounts and refunds. c. Refunds are amounts paid back by the vendor generally in recognition of damaged shipments, overpayments, or return purchases. d. Rebates represent refunds of a part of the cost of goods or services. Rebates differ from quantity discounts in that it is based on dollar value of purchases, not quantity of purchases. 258 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I e. \"Other cost-related income\" includes amounts generated through the sale of a previously expensed item, e.g., supplies or equipment.

Eight and one-half percent of net investment in fixed assets related to client care will be allowed annually, as a return on investment, to profit motivated entities. History: Effective July 1, 1984. 1. The principles of reimbursement for provider costs require that payment for services should include depreciation on depreciable assets that are used to provide allowable services to clients. This includes assets that may have been fully or partially depreciated on the books of the provider, but are in use at the time the provider enters the program. The useful lives of such assets are considered not to have ended and depreciation calculated on the revised extended useful life is allowable. Likewise, a depreciation allowance is permitted on assets that are used in a normal standby or emergency capacity. 2. Depreciation methods are as follows: a. The straight-line method of depreciation must be used. The method and procedure for computing depreciation must be applied on a basis consistent from year to year and 262 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I 3. 4. 5. detailed schedules of individual assets must be maintained. If the books of account reflect depreciation different than that submitted on the cost report, a reconciliation must be prepared. b. The depreciable life of an asset is its expected useful life to the provider; not necessarily the inherent useful or physical life. If a difference is considered, a salvage value should be established prior to the application of the depreciation rate. The useful life is determined in the light of the providers experience and the general nature of the asset and other pertinent data. In projecting a useful life, providers are to follow the useful life guidelines published by the United States internal revenue service. A different useful life may be used; however, when the useful life selected differs significantly from that established by the guidelines, the deviation must be based on convincing reasons supported by adequate documentation, generally describing the realization of some unexpected event. A composite useful life may be used for a class or group of assets. Acquisitions are treated as follows: a. If a depreciable asset has, at the time of its acquisition, an estimated useful life of at least two years and historical cost of at least three hundred dollars, or if it is acquired in quantity and the cost of the quantity is at least five hundred dollars, its cost must be capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. Cost during the construction of an asset, such as architectural, consulting and legal fees, interest, etc., should be capitalized as a part of the cost of the asset. b. Major repair costs on equipment or buildings must be capitalized if the repairs have increased the useful life of the asset by at least two years. Proper assets can be cost. records will provide accountability for the fixed and also provide adequate means by which depreciation computed and established as an allowable client-related The basis for depreciation is as follows: a. The amount of historical costs shall not exceed the lower of: (1) Current reproduction costs less straight-line depreciation over the life of the asset to the time of purchase; or 263 (2) Fair market value at the time of purchase. In the case of a trade-in, the historical cost will consist of the sum of the book value of the trade-in plus the cash paid. b. For depreciation purposes, donated assets may be recorded and depreciated based on their fair market value. In the case where the provider's records do not contain the fair market value of the donated asset, as of the date of the donation, an appraisal must be made. An appraisal made by a recognized appraisal expert will be accepted for depreciation. c. No prov1s1on shall be made for increased costs due to the sale of a facility. 6. Providers which finance facilities pursuant to North Dakota Century Code chapter 6-09.6, subject to the approval of the department, may elect to be reimbursed based upon the mortgage principle payments rather than depreciation. Once an election is made by the provider, it may not be changed without department approval. History: Effective July 1, 1984. 1. In genera 1: a. To be allowable under the program, interest must be: b. (1) Supported by evidence of an agreement that funds were borrowed and that payment of interest and repayment of the funds are required; (2) Identifiable in the provider's accounting records; (3) Related to the reporting period in which the costs are incurred; and (4) Necessary and proper for the operation, maintenance, or acquisition of the provider's facilities used therein. In such cases where it was necessary to issue bonds for financing, any bond premium or discount shall be accounted for and written off over the life of the bond issue. 264 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I 2.

A provider may combine or 11pool\" various funds in order to maximize the return on investment. Where funds are pooled, proper records must be maintained to preserve the identity of each fund in order to permit the earned income to be related to its source. Income earned on gifts and grants does not reduce allowable interest expense. 4. Funded depreciation requirements are as follows: a. Funding of depreciation is the practice of setting aside cash or other liquid assets to be used for replacement of the assets depreciated or for other capital purposes. The deposits are, in effect, made from the cash generated by the noncash expense depreciation. b. Deposits to the funded depreciation account are generally in an amount equal to the depreciation expense charged to costs each year. In order to qualify for all provisions of funding depreciation, the minimum deposits to the account must be fifty percent of the depreciation expensed that year. Deposits in excess of accumulated depreciation are allowable; however, the interest income generated by the \"extra deposits will be considered as a reduction of allowable interest expense. This provision is recommended as a means of conserving funds for the replacement of depreciable assets. It is expected that the funds will be invested to earn revenues. The revenues generated by this investment will not be considered as a reduction of allowable interest expense provided such revenues remain in the fund. c. Monthly or annual deposits representing depreciation must be in the funded depreciation account for six months or more to be considered as valid funding transactions. Deposits of less than six months are not eligible for the benefits of a funded depreciation account. However, if deposits invested before the six-month period remain in the account after the six-month period, the investment income for the entire p~riod will not reduce the allowable interest expensed in that period. Total funded depreciation in excess of accumulated depreciation on client-related assets will be considered as ordinary investments and the income therefrom will be used to offset interest expense. d. Withdrawals for the acquisition payment of mortgage principal on 265 of capital assets, the these assets and for other capital expenditures are on a first-in, first-out basis. e. The provider may not use the funds in the funded depreciation account for purposes other than the improvement, replacement, or expansion of facilities or equipment replacement or acquisition related to client services. f. Existing funded depreciation accounts must be used for all capital outlays in excess of three hundred dollars except with regard to those assets purchased exclusively with donated funds or from the operating fund, provided no amount was borrowed to complete the purchase. Should funds be borrowed, or other provisions not be met, the entire interest for the funded depreciation income account will be offset up to the entire interest expense paid by the facility for the year in question. History: Effective July 1, 1984. organization. 1. Costs applicable to services, facilities, and supplies furnished to a provider by a related organization shall not exceed the lower of the cost to the related organization or the price of comparable services, facilities, or supplies purchased elsewhere primarily in the local market. Providers must identify such related organizations and costs in the cost report. An appropriate statement of cost and allocations must be submitted with the cost report. For cost reporting purposes, management fees will be considered administrative costs. 2. A chain organization consists of a group of two or more program entities which are owned, leased, or through any other device, controlled by one business entity. 3. Home offices of chain organizations vary greatly in size, number of locations, staff, mode of operations, and services furnished to their member facilities. Although the home office of a chain is normally not a provider in itself, it may furnish to the individual provider, central administration or other services such as centralized accounting, purchasing, personnel, or management services. Only the home office's actual cost of prcviding such services is includable in the provider's allowable costs under the program. Any services 266 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I provided by the home office which are included in cost as payments to an outside provider will be considered a duplication of costs and not be allowed. History: Effective July 1, 1984. expense paid to a related organization. 1. A provider may lease a facility from a related organization within the meaning of the principles of reimbursement. In such a case, the rent paid to the lessor by the provider is not allowable as a cost, except for providers subject to chapter 75-04-03, whose rent payments shall not exceed the actual cost of mortgage payments of principal and interest. The cost of ownership of the facility would, however, be an allowable cost to the provider. Generally, these would be costs such as depreciation, interest on the mortgage, real estate taxes, and other expenses attributable to the leased facility. The effect is to treat the facility as though it were owned by the provider. Therefore, the owner's equity in the leased assets is includable in the equity capital of the provider. 2. In order to be considered an allowable cost, the home office cost must be directly related to those services performed for individual providers and relate to client services. An appropriate share of indirect costs will also be considered. Documentation as to the time spent, the services provided, the hourly valuation of services and the allocation method used must be available to substantiate the reasonableness of the cost.

Taxes in connection with financing, refinancing, or refunding operation, such as taxes in the issuance of bonds, property transfers, issuance or transfers of stocks, etc. Generally, these costs are either amortized over the life of the securities or depreciated over the life of the asset. They are not, however, recognized as tax expense. d. Taxes from which exemptions are available to the provider. e. Special assessments on land which represent capital improvements, such as sewers, water, and pavements, should be capitalized and may be depreciated. f. Taxes on property which is not used in the provision of covered services. History: Effective July 1, 1984. incidental funds. 1. Each client is allowed to retain a specific monthly amount of income for personal needs. These personal needs include such items as clothes, tobacco, or other day-to-day incidentals. This monthly allowance is not to be applied toward the resident's cost of care. Generally, the source of income for personal needs is from social security, veterans benefits, private income, economic assistance, or supplemental security income (SSI). 2. Providers managing client funds must maintain a current client account record in a form and manner prescribed by the department. Copies of the client account record must be provided to the client without charge. 3. The department will conduct audits of random samples of client account records in conjunction with regular field audits. 4. Adult client funds may be permission in the absence of a incompetency. disbursed with the client's guardian or declaration of 5.

Nonprescription vitamins or combinations of vitamins with minerals may be paid when ordered by the attending physician and the resident, parent, guardian, or responsible relative approves such use of the resident's funds. 7. Charges by the program for items or services furnished clients will be allowed as a charge against the client or outside sources, only if separate charges are also recorded by the 269 facility for all clients rece1v1ng these items or services directly from the program. All such charges must be for direct, identifiable services or supplies furnished individual clients. A periodic 11flat11 charge for routine items, such as beverages, cigarettes, etc., will not be allowed. Charges may be made only after services are performed or items are delivered, and charges are not to exceed charges to all classes of clients for similar services. 8. Residents' private property must be clearly marked with his name. The facility must keep a record of private property. if items are lost, the circumstances of disappearance must be documented in the facility's records. 9. If client funds are deposited in a bank, they must be deposited in an account separate and apart from any other bank accounts of the facility. Any interest earned on this account will be credited to the applicable resident's accounts. 10. Residents' funds on deposit with the facility must be available to residents on their request. No funds may be withdrawn from accounts of residents capable of managing their own funds without their permission. 11.

Movement of clients between levels of service by a provider or between providers must be pursuant to a determination by an individual habilitation team. Reimbursement for the cost of the new service must be contingent upon the timely submission to the department of a revised individual habilitation plan. 2. Movement of clients must be subject to the policies and procedures of the North Dakota case management system and the approval of the department. 3. Any emergency movement may be initiated by the provider only with immediate notification of the department, parent, guardian, and advocate. The movement will be subject to the subsequent review by the department which will determine if: a. An emergency existed; b. The rights of the client were protected and preserved; c. Documentation exists in support of the providers action; d. A prognosis of the c1ient1s potential for returning has been made; and e. Services required to maintain the client in a habilitative setting least restrictive of liberty have been provided prior to movement. 4. The department will determine whether a payment should be stopped as a consequence of the vacancy caused by movement of a client. 5. Upon a finding, by the department, that movement of a client constituted a violation of any right secured to the client by North Dakota Century code chapter 25-01.2, the department may withhold payment for services provided during the period of time that the violation existed.

The following direct-care staff to client ratios shall form the basis for the determination of the rate of reimbursement for providers of service to developmentally disabled persons. Additional staff may be necessary to meet the needs of the clients and may be added subject to the approval of the department. a. Intermediate care facilities disabled shall be subject to requirements of 42 CFR 442.445. for the developmentally the direct-care staffing b. Transitional community living facility shall maintain a one to eight direct-care staff to client ratio during those periods when the clients are awake and on the premises, and a one to sixteen ratio when clients are asleep. c. Minimally supervised living arrangements and providers congregate care for the aged shall maintain one direct-care staff onsite when clients are present, but in no case shall the direct-care staff to client ratio be less than one to sixteen. d. In minimally supervised apartment living arrangements, one direct-care staff shall be onsite when clients are present, but in no case shall the direct-care staff to client ratio be less than one to twenty. e. Supported living arrangements shall maintain a direct-care staff to client ratio of one to twenty-five. f. Developmental day activity shall maintain a direct-care staff to client ratio of one to five. g. Developmental work activity shall maintain a direct-care staff to client ratio of one to five for the first fifteen clients and one to ten for additional clients. h. Vocational dev~lopment shall maintain a direct-care staff to client ratio of three to twenty for the first twenty clients and one to ten for additional clients. i. Vocational evaluation shall maintain one work evaluator for sixty evaluations per annum. j. Infant development shall maintain one therapist for every fifteen children. k.

On-the-job training and work adjustment training shall maintain a staff to client ratio of one to twenty. m. Congregate living arrangements for children shall maintain a direct-care staff to client ratio of one to four. History: Effective July 1, 1984. 1. A calculation of the total number of employees necessary to meet staff to client ratios is made on the basis of a full-time equivalent employee. Assuming that a full-time employee has fifty-two working weeks of five days each, twelve holidays, ten vacation days and ten sick days per year, the actual number of days worked is two hundred and twenty-eight per year. Providers who grant fewer paid absences must use a full-time equivalent calculation which reflects a higher number of working days. 2. Assuming a two hundred twenty-eight day work year: a. Staffing for the three hundred sixty-five day service provided by a residential service provider each year requires 1.6 full-time equivalent staff persons for each shift slot to be filled at all times (two hundred twenty-eight times 1.6 equals three hundred sixty-five). b. Staffing for the two hundred sixty days of service provided by a day service provider each year requires 1.14 full-time equivalent staff persons for each staff required by the ratio (two hundred twenty-eight times 1.14 equals two hundred sixty). 3. To calculate the number of duty hours in a week, eight hours per day for five days (day services) and eight hours per night for seven nights (sleep time) are subtracted from the total hours of the week for residential service providers.

I NOVEMBER 1983 STAFF COMMENT -Section 75-02-01-08 (County administration and share of assistance costs): Adds two new subsections which would provide for administration of AFDC benefits by the county in which the applicant or recipient lives. Also amends an existing subsection to provide a mechanism by which a county can appeal the decision of another county which designates it to participate in financing of AFDC payments. 75-02-01-08. assistance cost. ee~~~y!s County administration and share of 1. Except as provided in subsection 2, the county where the families with dependent children unit is physically present will be responsible for the administration of the program with respect to that unit. 2. Where a family unit receiving assistance moves from one county to another, the outgoing county continues to be responsible for the administration of the program with respect to that unit until the last day of the month after the month in which the unit assumes physical residence in an incoming county. ~~ 3. For purposes of apportioning the countys share of assistance costs in the aid to families with dependent children program, all of the following principles shall govern: a. The county in which the person has resided for the past year, provided the person has not received assistance from another county during that time, except in the instance described in subdivision d. b. A person who has lived in the state for at least a year but not in any one county shall be ascribed to the county 275 in which the person has longest resided within the twelve months prior to application. c. The county's portion of aid to families with dependent children costs for a child who is a resident of the state but not a particular county, by virtue of not having lived in the state for a year, shall b~ borne by the county in which the child becomes in need. An exception to this subdivision exists if the child is committed to a state institution before establishing legal residence in a county and is subsequently returned to a community. In this instance, the child is the financial responsibility of the county from which the child was committed. d. A child whose mother marries a man having residence in a county different from their own follows that of the stepfather regardless of whether or not the child was a recipient at the time of the marriage. If the child was a recipient and eligibility continues after the marriage, financial responsibility shall be promptly transferred to the new county of residence in such manner that no lapse in assistance occurs. e. Similarly a stepchild and the stepchild's parent who moves with the stepchild's stepparent to another county shall become a resident of the new county if the stepparent (or any person residing with the stepparent whom the stepparent is legally responsible to support) becomes a resident therein by residing there a year without receiving assistance from another county. f. An aid to families with dependent children program family whose assistance from North Dakota is properly terminated because of a supposedly permanent move to another state may move back to North Dakota within a relatively short time but to a county other than the one originally providing assistance. For assistance purposes the family shall be regarded as new state residents and dealt with in the manner described in subdivision c. ~~ ~When the county of cost responsibility is in doubt, the county in which dependent children unit is physically present shall process the application promptry-\u00ad and designate the county to participate in the financing of any payments 'l:iR~B~ ~ae ~es!:eie:aee !:ss'l::le ea:a :ee ~ese:!:veei.

History: Effective September 1, 1980; amended effective December 1, 1983. General Authority: 1396h; 4.2 8FR 44~~.2~~ 1. The principles of reimbursement for provider costs require that payment for services should include depreciation on all depreciable type assets that are used to provide eeve~ea necessary services to medical assistance recipients. This includes assets that may have been fully (or partially) depreciated on the books of the provider~ but are in use at the time the provider enters the program. The useful lives of such assets are considered not to have ended and depreciation calculated on the revised extended useful life is allowable. Likewise, a depreciation allowance is permitted on assets that are used in a normal standby or emergency capacity. 2. Depreciation methods. a. The straight-line method of depreciation must be used. All accelerated methods of depreciation are unacceptable. The method and procedure for computing depreciation must be applied on a basis consistent from year to year and 295 detailed schedules of individual assets shall be maintained. If the books of account reflect depreciation different than that submitted on the ie!!m 6:;z4 cost report, a reconciliation el'l.a:I:::I:: must be prepared bytfie facility. b. The depreciable life of an asset is its expected useful life to the provider; not necessarily the inherent useful or physical life. If a difference is considered, a salvage value should be established prior to the application of the depreciation rate. The useful life is determined in the light of the provider's experience and the general nature of the asset and other pertinent data. In projecting a useful life, providers are to follow the useful life guidelines published by the American hospital association. A different useful life may be used; however, when the useful life selected differs significantly from that established by the guidelines, the deviation must be based on convincing reasons supported by adequate documentation, generally describing the realization of some unexpected event. The depreciation options made available for income tax purposes, such as those offered under the asset depreciation range system~ may not be used for purposes of reimbursement. A composite useful life may be used for a class or group of assets. 3. Acquisitions. a. If a depreciable asset has, at the time of its acquisition, an estimated useful life of at least two years and historical cost of at least ~k!!ee five cost must be capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. Cost during the construction of an asset, such as architectural, consulting and legal fees, interest, etc., should be capitalized as a part of the cost of the asset. b. Depreciable assets acquired by donation may be depreciated provided the asset is valued at the fair market value and the basis for determining such value is reported and determined to be reasonable. ~ c. Major repair costs in excess of one thousand dollars on equipment or buildings must be records will provide accountability for the fixed assets and also provide adequate means by which depreciation can be computed and established as an allowable 296 patient-related cost~ Tagging of major equipment items is not mandatory, but alternate records must exist to satisfy audit verification of the existence and location of the assets. 5. Basis for depreciation. a. H~s~e~~ea\u00b1 Oepreci ab 1 lower of: (1) Current reproduction costs less straight-line depreciation over the life of the asset to the time of purchase; e~ (2) Fair market value at time of purchase~i_Q! ill In the case of a trade-in, ~1\\e 1\\~s~e~~ea\u00b1 ees~ w~\u00b1\u00b1 ee~s~s~ ei the sum of the book value of the trade-in plus the cash paid. b. For depreciation purposes~ donated assets may be recorded and depreciated based on their fair market where the provider1s records do not contain the fair market value of the donated asset, as of the date of the donation, an appraisal must be made. The appraisal will be made by a recognized appraisal expert and will be accepted for depreciation and return on investment purposes. The facility may elect to forego depreciation on donated assets thereby negating the need for a fair market value determination. c. Purchase of a facility and its depreciable assets as an ongoing operation. (1) Determination of the cost basis of a facility and its depreciable assets of an ongoing operation depends on whether or not the transaction is a bona fide sale. Should the issue arise, the purchaser has the burden of proving that the transaction was a bona fide sale. Purchases where the buyer and seller are related organizations are not bona fide. The cost basis of a facility and its depreciable assets acquired as an ongoing operation ~~ a ee~a i:i:ae sa\u00b1e is 1 i mi ted to the lowest of the following: (a) Current reproduction cost of the assets, depreciated on a straight-line basis over its useful life to the time of the sale; 297 (2) (b) Price paid by the purchaser (actual cost); e~ (c) Fair market value of the facility or asset at the time of the ~6 a\u00b16e \u00b1~!d~eEi \u00b1ewe~ ~fiaR 6~e~a~a~~a~fi6 a, :e, aREi e.

To properly provide for costs or valuations of fixed assets, an appraisal will be required if the provider: t\u00b17 (a) Has no historical cost records or has incomplete records of depreciable fixed assets; or f~7 ~ Purchases a facility without designation of purchase price for the classification of assets acquired. Prior to having an appraisal made, the provider must inform the state that it intends to have the appraisal made. At this time the provider shall also set forth the reasons for the appraisal and will make available to the 6~a~e department the agreement between the provider and the appraiser. The appraisal agreement should contain the appraisal date, the estimated date of completion, the scope of the appraisal, and the statement that the appraisal will conform to the current medicare regulation on principles of reimbursement for provider cost. e-: ill Limitation. The 6~a~e department will recognize appraised value not to exceed cost basis for tax purposes. In all cases of major change, proper authority for expenditure shall be obtained.

SYNOPSIS: Amended prov1s1ons regarding funded depreciation accounts to make clear the requirement that, where such accounts exist, they are to be used in the purchase or improvement of capital assets. 298 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I 75-02-06-04. Interest expense. 1. General. a. To be allowable under the program, interest must be: (1) Supported by evidence of an agreement that funds were borrowed and that payment of interest and repayment of the funds are required; (2) Identifiable in the providers accounting records; (3) Related to the reporting period in which the costs are incurred; aBa (4) Necessary and or acquisition ~ae~e:!:B-: and 202.3; and proper for the operation, maintenance, of the providers facilities ~eea as set forth in HIM-15 paragraphs 202.2 (5) Unrelated to funds borrowed to purchase assets in excess of cost or fair market value. b. In such cases where it was necessary to issue bonds for financing, any bond premium or discount shall be aeee~B'I:::ea ie~ aBa w~!:'l:::'l:::eB eii amortized over the life of the bond issue. 2. Interest paid by the provider to partners, stockholders, or related organizations of the provider is not allowable as a cost. Where the owner ~eee ~ae ewBe~le ewB loans funds !:B to a funds are ---coiiS ide red !:Bves'l:::ea i~Bae e~ capital, rather than borrowed funds. 3. Where the provider has invested funds from gifts or grants which are unrestricted as to use, and these funds are commingled with other funds so that identity is lost, the providers allowable interest expense is reduced by the amount of investment income earned by the fund. Any investment income in excess of interest expense will not be used to offset other operating expenses. However, if the unrestricted gifts and grants are not commingled with other funds or identity is maintained as in a 11pool11, the investment income earned by the fund does not reduce allowable interest expense. 4. Restricted gifts will be treated in a manner consistent with HIM-15, Section 600. 5. If a facility incurs interest expense because of late payments by patients and charges the patients a service charge or interest for late payments, such income must be offset against interest expense. 299 ~ 6. Funded depreciation. a. Funding of depreciation is the practice of setting aside cash or other liquid assets, in a fund separate from the general funds of the provider, to be used for replacement of the assets depreciated, or for other capital purposes . The deposits are, in effect, made from the cash generated by the noncash expense depreciation. b. Deposits to the funded depreciation account are generally in an amount equal to the depreciation expense charged to costs each year. In order to qualify for all provisions of \u20ac~~a~~~ funded depreciation~ the m1n1mum deposits~ exclusive of interest income to the account eRa~~. must be fifty percent of the depreciation expensed that year. Deposits in excess of accumulated depreciation are allowable; however, the interest income generated by the 11extra11 deposits wi 11 be considered as a reduction of allowable interest expense. This provision is recommended as a means of conserving funds for the replacement of depreciable assets and purchase of capital assets. It is expected that the funds will be invested to earn revenues. The revenues generated by this investment will not be considered as a reduction of allowable interest expense~ provided the interest remains in the funded depreciation account. c. Monthly or annual deposits representing depreciation must be in the funded depreciation account for six months or more to be considered as valid funding transactions. Deposits of less than six months are not eligible for the benefits of a funded depreciation account. However, if deposits invested before the six-month period remain in the account after the six-month period, the investment income for the entire period will not reduce the allowable interest expensed in that period. Total funded depreciation in excess of accumulated depreciation on patient-related assets will be considered as ordinary investments and the income therefrom will be used to offset interest expense. d. Withdrawals for the acquisition of capital assets, the payment of mortgage principal on these assets and for other capital expenditures are on a first-in, first-out basis. Withdrawals for general operating purposes or for loans to the general fund are made on a last-in, first-out basis. Such loans must meet the 11necessary and proper11 requirements for need of the loan. Interest paid \u20ace~ from the general fund to the funded depreciation account on--the loan is an allowable cost, except as mentioned in subdivision c~ where the deposit has not been in the fund for the six-month period~ the interest paid on the loan is not an allowable cost. Loans made to the general fund 300 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I e~a~~ may not .be made for a period or term which is longer than th~~\u00b7 years. Documentation on prevailing interest rates at the time of the loan shall be maintained on file. The necessary and proper requirements set forth in HIM-15 ~a~a~~a~~ paragraphs 202.2 and 202.3 wi 11 apply to all loans made. e. The provider may use the funds in the funded depreciation account for purposes other than the improvement, replacement, or expansion of facilities or equipment related to patient care. However, allowable interest expenses for the period of withdrawal will be reduced to adjust for offsets not made in prior years for earnings applicable to such funds. For example, if the provider withdraws funds equal to two years deposits, using the last-in, first-out method, any earnings applicable to these deposits during the two-year period are applied as a reduction of interest expense incurred during the period of withdrawal. When funded depreciation accounts are used for capital and noncapital purchases, the total interest income will be offset. f. When money is borrowed to fund depreciation, interest paid by the provider on the money borrowed for this purpose is not an allowable cost. g. Funded depreciation is to be used both for the replacement of existing assets and for expansion. These funds must be used for all capital outlays in excess of ~~~ee five hundred dollars except with regard to those assets purchased exclusively with donated funds, and cannot be restricted for a specific or future purpose. For example, restricting. the account to funding depreciation for 11building11 would negate the intent of funding depreciation as defined by this section. h. When capital purchases are made with borrowed funds rather than funds from the funded depreciation account, the entire interest 1ncome for funded depreciation will be offset up to the entire interest expense.

SYNOPSIS: Amended the 11reasonableness11 test for managerial and administrative compensation so as to make tests identical for all persons whose compensation is subject to the test, and identified the specific categories of persons whose compensation would be subject to the test. 301 Amended the prov1s1ons relating to the allowability of board of directors fees to identify 12 meetings per fiscal year as normal, and to limit additional compensation for employees who serve on the board of directors a\u00b1\u00b1ewae\u00b1e eee~~ 1. Compensation may be included in allowable provider costs only to the extent that it represents reasonable remuneration for managerial, admini~trative, professional , or other services related to the operation of the facility and rendered in connection with patient care. Services which are not related either to direct or indirect patient care are primarily accomplished for the purpose of managing or improving the owner's financial investment and are not allowable . Data necessary to establish the rendering of patient care must 302 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I include the hours, types and valuation basis of the work performed. s~ a. Reasonableness requires that the compensation allowance be such an amount as would ordinarily be paid for comparable services by comparable institutions depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Reasonableness also requires that functions performed be necessary in that, had the services not been rendered, an institution would have had to employ another person to perform them. The services must be pertinent to the operation and sound conduct of the demonstrate reasonableness of compensation. The department may use internal revenue service guidelines as the basis for determining reasonableness. e~ b. Items which are considered compensation and includable in the test for reasonable compensation received by aR aaM:i:R:i:e~~a~e~ any person identified in subdivision c include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) Salary amounts paid for managerial, administrative, professional, and other services.

Any person who occupies any position on the provider's governing board or group, however constituted . Any person who is a bondholder or creditor, or an officer in a corporate bondholder or creditor, to whom or which the provider is obligated to pay in excess of five thousand dollars. Any person who has an ownership interest in, or is an officer of, any related organization. (6) Any person within the third degree of relationship to any person identified in paragraphs 1 through 5. d. The department will determine reasonable administrator compensation by survey of free standing facilities every two years. Survey data will be revised at least annually to reflect changes in the consumer price index. Any limits implemented in section 75-02-06-16 will also apply to compensation . of residents are allowable. The facility may include the amount authorized by North Dakota Century Code section 54-06-09 for mileage or may charge actual cost in accordance with internal revenue service guidelines for employee mileage with depreciation calculated on the straight-line basis. The facility shall support travel costs with sufficient documentation to establish the purpose of the travel and that it is patient related. 304 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I a.

No prov1s1ons of these plans may discriminate in favor of certain employees, such as employees who are officers, stockholders, supervisors, or highly paid personnel. In order to be considered an allowable cost, the payment reported must benefit all eligible employees and be based on the same payment structure.

General Authority: 1980; NDCC 50-24.1-04 42 USC amended effective December 1, AGENCY SYNOPSIS : Amended prov1s1ons relating to the home office costs of chain organizations to require a demonstrated cost savings by such an organization which wishes to include any component of home office costs in the individual facility's rate. 75-02-06-07. Related organization. 1. Costs applicable to services, facilities, and supplies furnished to a provider organization may not exceed the lower of the cost to the related organization or the price of comparable services, facilities, or supplies purchased elsewhere primarily in the local market. Providers ~~s~ shall identify such related organizations and costs in the cost--report . An appropriate statement of cost and allocations ~~s~ shall be submitted with the annual cost report 6~4. For cost reporting purposes, management fees will be considered as administrative costs. 2. A chain organization consists of a group of two or more health care facilities which are owned, leased, or through any other device controlled by one business entity. This includes not only proprietary chains but also chains operated by various religious and other charitable organizations. 3. Home offices of chain organizations vary greatly in size, number of locations, staff, mode of operations, and services furnished to their member facilities . Although the home office of a chain is normally not a provider in itself, it may furnish to the individual provider, central administration or other services such as centralized accounting, purchasing, personnel, or management services. Only the home office's actual cost of providing such services is includable in the provider's allowable costs under the program. Any services provided by the home office which are also included in cost as payments to an outside provider will be considered a duplication of costs and not be allowed. The related organization shall clearly demonstrate a cost savings to the department in order to include each component of home office costs in the rate for individual facilities .

A provider may lease a facility from a related organization within the meaning of the principles of reimbursement. In such case, the rent paid to the lessor by the provider is not allowable as cost. The provider, however, would include the cost of ownership of the facility. Generally, these would be costs such as depreciation, interest on the mortgage, real estate taxes, and other expenses attributable to the leased facility. The effect is to treat the facility as though it were owned by the provider. Therefore, the owner's equity in the leased assets is includable in the equity capital of the proprietary provider. 2. In order to be considered an allowable cost, the home office cost must be directly related to those services performed for individual providers and relate to patient care. An appropriate share of indirect costs will also be considered. Documentation as to time or services provided must be available to substantiate cost. History: Effective September 1, 1980; amended effective December 1, 1983. 75-02-06-09. Taxes. 1. General. a. Taxes assessed against the provider, the levying enactments of the several levels of government and for which the for payment, are allowable costs. Tax include fines, penalties, or those subsection 2. in accordance with states and lower provider is liable expense may not taxes listed in b. Whenever exemptions to taxes are legally available the provider is to take advantage of them. If the provider does not take advantage of available exemptions, the expense incurred for such taxes a~e is not recognized as allowable costs under the program. -- 2. 'i'aHee :ae~ a~ ~ewa:e~e ae eee~e-: The fo 11 owing taxes, which are levied on providers, are not allowable as costs: a. Federal income and excess profit taxes, including any interest or penalties paid thereon. b. State or local income and excess profit taxes. 307 c. Taxes in connection with financing, refinancing, or refunding operation, such as taxes in the issuance of bonds, property transfers, issuance or transfers of stocks, etc. Generally, these costs are either amortized over the life of the securities or depreciated over the life of the asset. They are not, however, recognized as tax expense. d. Taxes \u00a3~em such as real estate and sales tax for which exemptions are available to the provider. e. Special assessments on land which represent capital improvements, such as sewers, water, and ~aveme:a~e'i' eRe~ia pavement, must be capitalized and may be depreciated ~o~v~e~r_t~h~e~i~r~u~s~e~f~ul~l~i~f~e. f. Taxes on property which is not used in the ~e~e:a~:i:e:a provision of covered services. g. Taxes, such as sales taxes, levied against the patient and collected and remitted by the provider. h. Self-employment (FICA) taxes applicable to individual proprietors, partners, members of a joint venture, etc. History: Effective September 1, 1980; amended effective December 1, 1983. Bad debts. Bad debts, charity, and courtesy allowances efiaii may not be included in allowable costs. History: Effective September 1, 1980; amended effective December 1, 1983. 75-02-06-11. Startup costs. In the first stages of operation, a new institution incurs certain costs in developing its ability to care for patients prior to admission of patients. Staff is obtained, organized, and other operating costs are incurred during this time of preparation which cannot be allocated to patient care during that period because there are no patients receiving services. Therefore, it is proper that such actual costs, commonly referred to as startup costs, be considered as deferred charges under the program and allocated over a number of periods which benefit from such costs. Where a provider has properly capitalized startup costs as a deferred charge, amortization of such costs will be recognized as allowable costs depreciated over sixty 308 I I consecutive months starting with the month in which the first patient is admitted for treatment. History: Effective September 1, 1980; amended effective December 1, 1983. General Authority: Subpart C AGENCY SYNOPSIS: Amended provision making costs incurred in the form of dues to charitable or civic organizations nonallowable so as to allow up to $150 per year with no specific showing the costs are patient related, and to allow amounts in excess of $150 per year upon a clear showing of patient relatedness. Added a provision which requires the facility to demonstrate the actual proportion of the use of any equipment by a facility where that equipment is not exclusively used by the facility. 75-02-06-12. Adjustment to cost and cost limitation. 1. Income to offset cost. a. Several items of income to the home will be considered as offsets against various costs as recorded in the books of the facility. Any income which is received by the home for reimbursements of cost, with the exception of the basic daily rate and income from charges to private pay patients for care items which are included in the title XIX rate, will be offset against costs to the extent it does not exceed costs reported. Any reimbursement not listed below, which may be classified as an offset, must be shown as such on the cost report !!\"e!!m 6iZ4 and costs reduced accordingly. Items of income, whether in cash or in any other form, to offset cost include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) \"Activities income.\" Income from the activities department income from the sale of pop, candy, or other items. (3) 11Dietary income.11 Amounts received from or on behalf of employees, guests, or other nonpatients for lunches, meals, or snacks. ( 4) 11Drugs or supp 1 i es income. 11 A:!: :I: !!eveHl:iee Amounts received from employees, doctors, or others not admitted as patients. 309 (5) \"Insurance recoveries income.\" Any amount received from insurance for a loss incurred shall be offset against costs reported in the current facility did not adjust the basis for depreciable assets. (6) \"Interest or investment income. Interest received on amounts allowable as funded depreciation or from earnings on restricted gifts or donations. (7) \"Laundry income.\" All amounts received for services rendered to or on behalf of employees, doctors, or others. (8) \"Maintenance of personnel.\" The cost aete~m:i:Reat of providing meals and nursing home personnel living on premises. fte lee lodging (9) 11Nonrelated depreciation expense.\" All depreciation ~e~e~tea :i:R ees:Es expense for facility assets which is not related to patient care. (10) \"Private duty nurse reimbursement.\" All reimbursement received for the providing of a private received from vendors on purchases included in costs. ( 12) 11Rebates and refunds income .11 ARy ~ei~Ra Amounts received on expense or cost :i:tem s:kall items must be offset against the appropriate cost. (13) 11Rentals of nursing home space income.11 Any revenues received from outside sources for the use of nursing home space and equipment. (14) \"Telegraph and telephone income.\" All revenues received from patients, guests, or employees. (15) All therapy and other professional services revenue unless services rendered to medical assistance program eligible patients and outpatients are identified and revenue from those services offset to the related co~t. b. Payments to a provider by its vendor will be considered as discounts, refunds, or rebates in determining allowable costs under the program even though these payments may be 310 to treated as \"contributions\" or \"unrestricted grants\" by the provider and the vendor. However, such payments may represent a true donation or grant. Examples include, but are not limited to, when: (1) they are made by a vendor in response to building or other fundraising campaigns in which communitywide contributions are solicited; (2) they are in addition to discounts, refunds, or rebates, which have been customarily allowed under arrangements between the provider and the vendor; (3) the volume or value of purchases is so nominal that no relationship to the contribution can be inferred; (4) the contributor is not engaged in business with the provider or a facility related to the provider. c. Where an owner or other official of a provider directly receives from a vendor monetary payments or goods or services for the owner's or official's own personal use as a result of the provider's purchases from the vendor, the value of such payments, goods, or services constitutes a type of refund or rebate and efieM~a must be applied as a reduction of the provider's costs for goods or services purchased from the vendor. d. Where the purchasing function for a provider is performed by a central unit or organization, all discounts, allowances, refunds, and rebates efieM~a must be credited to the costs of the provider in accordance with the instructions above. These should not be treated as income of the central purchasing function or used to reduce the administrative costs of that function. Such administrative costs are, however, properly allocable to the facilities serviced by the central purchasing function. e. Amounts paid by a supplier for the use of space or equipment in a hospital or long-term care facility will ordinarily be found to constitute a form of discount, whether paid as a percentage of charges or as a flat amount per bed or per time period. Payments made by a supplier to a provider in recognition of the fact that the supplier is relieved of the need to collect individual bills from the patients of the provider, sometimes called \"accounting fees\" or \"collection fees\", are considered a form of discount, refund, or rebate and efieM~a must be used to reduce the costs of the goods or services purchased from the supplier. f. Purchase discounts, allowances, refunds, and rebates are reductions of the cost of whatever was purchased. They are not to be considered a form of income. They efieM~a must be used to reduce the specific costs to which they apply. If possible, they should accrue to the period to which they apply. If not, they will reduce expenses in 311 2. the period in which they are received. The reduction to expense for supplies or services must be used to reduce the total cost of the goods or services for all patients without regard to whether the goods or supplies are designated for all patients or a specific group, e.g., medicare or nonmedicare. (1) 11Purchase discounts11 include cash discounts, trade, and quantity discounts. 11Cash discount11 is for prepaying or paying within a certain time of receipt of invoice. \"Trade discount11 is a reduction of cost granted certain customers. \"Quantity discounts11 are reductions of price because of the size of the order. (2) Allowances are reductions granted or accepted by the creditor for damage, delay, shortage, imperfection, or other cause, excluding discounts and refunds. (3) Refunds are amounts paid back by the vendor generally in recognition of damaged shipments, overpayments, or returned purchases. (4) Rebates represent refunds of a part of the cost of goods or generated through the sale of a previously item, e.g., supplies or equipment. amounts expensed Costs not appropriate maintaining activities. reimbursable following: related to patient care are costs which are not or necessary and proper in developing and the operation of patient care facilities and Such costs are not allowable in computing costs. They include, but are not limited to, the a. Costs which are unallowable when incurred by a facility are also unallowable for a home office and cannot be allocated to facilities in a chain organization. b. Certain corporate costs, such as stockholder serv1c1ng costs, organization costs, or reorganization costs are not related to patient care and are not allowable. c.

The full cost of items or services such as telephone , television, and radio which are located in patient accommodations and which are furnished solely for the personal comfort of the patients are not includable in allowable costs. e. Fundraising costs, including salaries, advertising, promotional or publicity costs incurred for such a purpose are not includable in allowable costs. f. Costs procurement and yell ow page ads eKee~~ ~fieee limited to the information furnished in the white telephone directory . g. The cost of any equipment, whether owned or leased, not exclusively used by the facility except to the extent that the facility demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the department, that any particular use of equipment was related to patient care. 3. All costs for services reimbursed by the department directly to the provider , e.g., pharmacy and therapies, must be excluded from the rate calculation. History: Effective September 1, 1980; amended effective December 1, 1983.

Patient census. 1. A patient day is any day that the facility has received remuneration for the available bed. The amount of remuneration has no bearing on whether a day should be counted or not. Examples of days that must be included in census, providing they have been paid for, are hospital days and therapeutic leave days. In the case where a private room has been made ei from a previously utilized double room and a rate has been charged that does not correspond to a normal private room rate, two patient days would be counted for this room. 2. A daily census record must be prepared and maintained by the facility to allow for proper audit of the census data. 3. Census days will be segregated by the level of care provided. If the facility does not document the level of care provided, the rate charged to the resident may be used by the department to establish the level of care. History: Effective September 1, 1980; amended effective December 1, 1983. Authority: C 75-02-06-15. Nursing care. Routine nursing care services are those services included by the provider in a daily services charge usually referred to as the room and board charge. The following types of items and services in addition to room dietary and medical social services sfia~~ must be considered to be routine for purposes of medicaid cost reporting even though they may be considered ancillary by the facility: 315 1. All general nursing services including but not limited to administration of oxygen and related medication, hand feeding, incontinency care, tray service, enemas, etc. 2. Items which are furnished routinely and relatively uniformly to all patients, e.g., patients gowns, water pitchers, basins, bedpans, etc. 3.

Items which are utilized by individual patients which are reusable and expected to be available in the facility providing a skilled or intermediate level of care, e.g., ice bags, bedrails, canes, crutches, walkers, wheelchairs, traction equipment, and other durable medical equipment. 5. Items which, while not listed above, came within the definitions set forth in the personal needs guidelines of the Guidelines for Routine Drugs, Supplies, and Equipment for Skilled Nursing and Intermediate Care Facilities as issued by the medical services division for any items which may not have been covered in the above but may come within the definitions set forth in the personal needs guidelines. 6. Special dietary supplements used for tube feeding or oral feeding such as elemental high nitrogen diet, even if written as a prescription item by a a~'d~7\u00b7 7.

General Authority: NDCC AGENCY SYNOPSIS: Amended prov1s1ons used to project salary and fringe benefit costs so as to use the facility's reasonable patient related costs from the previous fiscal yea~, adjusted by a specific Consumer Price Index. Amended prov1s1ons relating to the facility's excess rate for Medical Assistance cases so as to require 316 charging of an the facility to report the overcharge, remit overcharged amounts within 30 days, and pay interest on amounts no repaid within 30 days.

Creates a new subsection which designates the method of establishing partial year rates for facilities changing ownership during the fiscal year, facilities adding beds during the fiscal year, for new facilities, and for facilities adding beds on the first day of the fiscal year. 75-02-06-16. Reimbursement. 1. The method of determining the reimbursement rate per day will be through the use of the prospective ratesetting system. The system requires that the rate be established during the year in which it will be effective with retroactive adjustment to the beginning of the facility's fiscal year. 2. The determination of a prospective rate for all accommodations begins with the actual cost of the facility's operations for the previous fi sea 1 year. Once :i:'4:. kae eeea ae'4:.e!!M:i:aea '4:.ka'4:. the reasonable patient-related are 7 :i:a iae'4:.7 !!eaeeaae~e ~a'4:.:i:ea'4:.-!!e~a'4:.ea eee'4:.e determined, adjustments are then applied to the historical cost to determine the prospective rate. Reasonable patient-related costs will be determined with reference to health insurance manual 15 (HIM-15) and instructions issued by the department. 3. The historical costs combined with the adjustments take into consideration the economic conditions and trends during the period to be covered by the rate. Costs which are incurred to meet certification standards shall be allowable and included in the determination of the rate. Rate adjustments to provide appropriate compensation may be requested where major unforeseeable expenses are incurred. Such requests may be made to the director of medical services, who shall determine if the expense is patient related and beyond the control of those responsible for the management of the facilities. The following adjustment methods will be used: a. ii~~e~ Salary and fringe benefit costs of the facility will be projected based upon the reasonable patient-related salary and fringe benefit costs incurred in the facility's previous fiscal year plus the unadjusted annual percent increase, if any, of the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers, nonfood expenditure categories, United States city average, as itemized under the subheading 11other profession a 1 servi ces11 of the heading \"medical care services\", as of the ending date of that fiscal year. b. Property costs will be included in the rate at the hi stori ca 1 amount un 1 ess the!fe in accordance with these rules. c. The other costs of the facility will be projected based upon the historical cost plus the annual percent of increase, if any, in the consumer price index as of the facility's fiscal year end. see:!:a:l: se:!:fv:!:ee eea:!:fa department shall accumulate and analyze statistics on costs incurred by the nursing facilities. These statistics may be used to establish reasonable ceiling limitations and incentives for efficiency and economy based on reasonable determination of \u00b7 standards of operations necessary for efficient delivery of needed services. These limitations and incentives may be established on the basis of cost of comparable facilities and services and may be applied as ceilings on the overall costs of providing services or on specific areas of operations. It shall be the option of the see:!:a:l: se:!:fviee eea:!:fa department to imp 1 ement the ceilings so mentioned at any time based upon the s~a~:!:s>E:!:es information available and under guidelines required within the regulations title such time as federal regulations establish a ceiling on medical rates for skilled nursing facilities, that ceiling shall also be considered the maximum for title XIX payment. c. A facility is expected to maintain an average annual occupancy rate which is based upon its size. Facilities with se:!:fe ~ to forty licensed beds should maintain an eighty-five percent occupancy rate; facilities with forty-one to sixty licensed beds should maintain a ninety percent occupancy rate; and facilities with sixty-one and more licensed beds should maintain a ninety-five percent occupancy rate. For facilities with less than the stated percentage for the period under consideration, the number of patient days for rate computation will be computed using the required percentage instead of the lower actual percentage of occupancy. The computed patient days will apply only to the following areas: (1) Administrative costs; (2) Plant operation costs; and (3) Property costs. A reserved paid bed will be counted as an occupied bed. A waiver to the minimum bed occupancy allowance may be made for new facilities or existing facilities which add new beds under a certificate of need during the first year of operation. Consideration will be given in these circumstances to the facts available. 319 d. Administrative cost shall be limited to fifteen percent of total allowable nursing home costs exclusive of administrative costs. e. For facilities which do not have an adequate accounting system to allocate costs to the various levels of care, the following methodology is used: (1) In calculating nursing care cost per day, total patient days are rated at a ratio of 1.0 for total skilled care days, .67 for total intermediate care days, and .12 for total custodial care days. (2) Costs other patient days. 5. Rate payments. than nursing are prorated over total (Subject to occupancy requirement.) a. The rate as established shall be considered as payment for all accommodations and includes all items designated as routine services for each level of care. No payments may be solicited or received from the patient or any other person to supplement the rate as established. b. The rate as established shall only be paid if the private pay patients' rates for semiprivate accommodations equal or exceed the established rate for medical services patients. The rate being charged private pay patients at the time the services a~e ee:i:Hf2f e~ were provided sfiaB: will govern. In cases where private pay patients are not charged a daily rate, the daily charge will be computed by dividing the total private pay charges for each month by the private pay census for each month. At no time shall the rate paid by medical services exceed the lesser of cost or private pay charges as previously defined. If at any time the facility discounts the private pay ~a~:i:eH~s rate for those periods of time that the patient is not in the facility, the discounted rate may He~ ee 3:ewe~ ~fiaH ~fie be the maximum chargeable to medical services patients. If the discounting policy eiees e~ea~e creates a situation in which the private rate is 1 ess, then a 11 medica 1 assistance patients shall be afforded a discount in the amount of the difference between the discounted private ~a~:i:eH~ rate and the established medical assistance rate. c. If the medical assistance reimbursement rate exceeds the private payment rate for a particular level of care, on any given date, the i ty sha 11 immediately report that fact to the department and charge the department at the lower rate. If payments were 320 I I I I I I I J I I I I I I I I I I I d. e. f. received at the higher rate, the facility shall, within thirty days, refund the overpayment.

This rate is only an interim rate. 321 (2) (3) Each facility must file an annual report 6~4 within three months of the end of its fiscal year. Within one month of the receipt of each ie~~ 6~4 report, it will be reviewed for completeness and accuracy. If the report is filed in a timely manner and if all information requested is present on the report, it will be used as a basis for establishing an interim rate for the facility within one month of filing. ~ke audit of the facility w~~~ may be done as a final step in the procedure. At that time the actual rate will be established retroactive to the start of the home's fiscal year. The rate so calculated will be considered the final rate. 6. Partial Year. a. For facilities changing ownership during the fiscal year, the rate established for the previous owner will be retained. b. For facilities adding beds during the year, the reimbursement rate for the new beds will be the same as for the other similarly licensed beds in the facility. c.

In 1979, the policies for the conduct of such hearings were first promulgated in rule form. Such hearings were originally required as a consequence of federal law in public assistance programs. State law now requires the department to conduct such hearings as a part of the \"due process11 rights of persons who find themselves aggrieved by decisions which the department, or the county social service boards, may have made. As a matter of policy, the department has extended the availability of administrative hearings to virtually all persons who seek to challenge or question the department1s decisions. Since the 1979 promulgation of these administrative hearing rules, numerous changes have taken place in federal requirements. Additionally, the department has been able to improve, and make more economical, the hearing process. These cumulative factors lead to the drafting of a series of amendments to Chapter 75-01-03. Virtually all of the changes are technical and relate to the administration of the hearings. Three of subsection 1 of subsection 4 75-01-03-16. the changes are not technical.

A fair hearing request may be denied or dismissed where the sole issue is one of state or federal law requiring automatic grant adjustments for classes of recipients unless the reason for an individual appeal is incorrect benefit computation. 4. The claimant may first seek corrective e~ e:E:ke~ a~~~e~~:t: a:Ee action from the department or c 1 a i mant 1 s county agency before filing a request for a fair hearing with the executive director of the eea~a department. A dissatisfied claimant of the services of the division of vocational rehabilitation must request and obtain an administrative review before the request for a fair hearing can be accommodated. A dissatisfied claimant is not otherwise required to seek :E:ka:E any corrective action before filing the request for a fair hearing. 5. If a claimant dies after a request for a fair hearing has been filed by the claimant, and before the decision of the sea~a department has been rendered in the case, the proceedings may be continued on behalf of the claimant1s estate, or by an heir of the claimant if a legal representative has not been duly appointed. 6. If a dissatisfied claimant dies before the claimant can file a request for a fair hearing, the duly appointed representative of the claimant1s estate, or any heir of the claimant if no representative has been appointed, may file such request when the claimant was dissatisfied with the denial of the claimant1s application for assistance, or was dissatisfied with .the amount of the assistance the claimant was receiving prior to the claimant1s death. History: Effective September 1, 1979; amended effective January decision. Withdrawal of request for fair hearing before 1. The claimant may withdraw the e3:a:i:maR:E.!..e request for fair hearing at any time before a decision is made by the eea~a department. 2. In cases where there appears to be a possibility for corrective action without further fair hearing proceedings, the claimant may file a conditional withdrawal of the e3:a:i:maR:E.!..e request for a fair hearing. Such conditional withdrawal will not prohibit the claimant from filing a new request for a fair hearing if the claimant remains dissatisfied with any such corrective action. No hearing 332 3. History: 1984. shall be delayed or canceled because of this possibility unless the claimant consents to such delay. The county information procedure. Effective agency shall provide the and assistance regarding claimant this with all withdrawal September 1' 1979; amended effective January 1, This amendment requires that requests for 11a fair hearing11 be made in writing, except with respect to food stamp decisions. The rule formerly allowed oral requests in any case. The change reflects the fact that the only requirement that hearings be provided in response to oral requests is contained in federal food stamp law. It has been the department1s experience that oral requests for fair hearings are extremely difficult to manage. On occasion, a person who makes a belated request for a hearing in writing will assert that timely request was made orally. This assertion will be based upon some general discussion with a department or county employee where the employee did not understand a request to have been made. Because no one has taken down the words of the conversation, it is impossible to know what was said, much less what was intended. 75-01-03-05. Claimant responsibility. 1. The claimant may must request a fair hearing in writing e~ e~a~~Y unless the request concerns a food stamp program decision. A claimant may request a fair hearing concerning a food stamp program decision either orally or in writing. Oral requests must be clear expressions, made by the claimant or the claimant1s authorized representative, to an employee of a county agency or the state agency to the effect that the claimant wishes to appeal a decision. The employee hearing such a request shall promptly reduce the request to writing and file it as provided by this section. The request may be filed on the back of a form 599 which gave notice of the proposed action which the claimant disputes; however, the request need not be in any particular form. The county agency shall assist the claimant in filing the claimant1s request for a fair the purpose of prompt action, the claimant shall be informed by the county agency that the claimants request for a fair hearing should identify the aid program involved as well as the reason for the claimant1s dissatisfaction with the particular action involved in the case. 333 History: Effective January 1, 1984. General Authority: September 1, 1979; amended effective July Time limit on request for fair hearing. 1. The request for fair hearing by a household aggrieved by any action of a county agency that affects participation in the food stamp program must be filed within ninety days after the order or action with which the claimant is dissatisfied. In all other cases, the request for fair hearing must be filed within thirty days after the order or action with which the claimant is dissatisfied. 2. The date of the order or action on which the request for fair hearing is based shall be the date on which notice of such order or action was mailed to the claimant with the following exceptions: a. Where requests for a fair hearing concern the return of erroneous repayments, the date of collection or the date of the last installment payment is the determining date. b. Where requests for a fair hearing concern the amount of the grant, the request must be filed within thirty days, but the period of review will extend back to the first of the month on which the first day of the thirty-day period occurred. c. When the claimant is aggrieved by an action of the division of vocational rehabilitation, the date in which the final decision of the s~a~e regional director on the claimant's request for administrative review is mailed to the claimant shall be the determining date. ~~ 3. In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by this chapter, the day of the act, event, or determination from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included. The last day of the period so computed shall be included, unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday. When the period of time prescribed or allowed is less than seven days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays shall be excluded from the computation.

Such explanation shall be given in such manner as to be fully understood by the claimant. 2. Written notice of the right to a fair hearing shall be included in every notification to the applicant or recipient of the granting, denial, decrease, discontinuance, suspension or increase in aid, or request for repayment, or where there is a change in a prior determination regarding aid. In all cases, the notice shall be prepared and mailed to the claimant or recipient in language understandable to the person receiving such notification. 3. The county agency or regional office must help the claimant to submit and process the claimant's request for a fair hearing. History: Effective 1984.
