Objectives of the ICH S12 Guideline 2 The objective of this guideline is to provide harmonised recommendations for the conduct of 3 nonclinical biodistribution (BD) studies in the development of gene therapy (GT) products. 4 This document provides recommendations for the overall design of nonclini cal BD 5 assessments . Considerations for interpretation and application of the BD data to support a 6 nonclinical development programme and the design of clinical trials are also provided. The 7 recommendations in this guideline endeavour to facilitate the devel opment of GT products 8 while avoiding unnecessary use of animals, in accordance with the 3Rs (reduce/refine/replace) 9 principles. 10 1.2. Background 11 An understanding of the BD profile of a GT product following in vivo administration is an 12 important element of the nonclinical development programme. BD data contribute to the 13 interpretation and design of nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology studies conducted to 14 support early -phase clinical trials in the target population. Although guidelines that include 15 recommendat ions for BD studies have been issued by various regulatory authorities, this 16 document provides a harmonised definition for nonclinical BD and conveys overall 17 considerations for assessing BD for GT products. 18 1.3. Scope 19 GT products within the scope of this guideline include products that mediate their effect by the 20 expression (transcription or translation) of transferred genetic materials. Some examples of GT 21 products can include purified nucleic acid (e.g., plasmids and RNA), microorganisms (e.g., 22 viruses, bacteria, fungi) genetically modified to express transgenes (including products that edit 23 the host genome), and ex vivo genetically modified human cells. Products that are intended to 24 alter the host cell genome in vivo without specific transcription or transla tion (i.e., delivery of 25 a nuclease and guide RNA by non-viral methods) are also covered in this guidance. Although 26 not currently considered GT in certain regions, the principles outlined in this guideline are also 27 applicable to oncolytic viruses that are not genetically modified to express a transgene. This 28 guideline does not apply to prophylactic vaccines . Chemically synthesised oligonucleotides or 29 their analogues , which are not produced using a biotechnology -based manufacturing process , 30 are outside the scope of this guideline . The release of a GT product outside the body via excreta 31 (feces), secreta (urine, saliva, nasopharyngeal fluids , etc.), or through the skin (pustules, sores, 32 wounds) is termed 'shedding'. Evaluation of the nonclinical shedding profile of a GT product 33 is outside the scope of this guideline. Assessment of genomic integration and germline 34 integration of GT products are also outside the scope of this guideline. 35 2. DEFINITION OF NONCLINICAL BD 36 BD is the in vivo distribution, persistence, and clearance of a GT product at the site of 37 administration and in target and non-target tissues, including biofluids (e.g., blood, 38 cerebrospinal fluid, vitreous fluid), in biologically relevant animal species. Nonclinical BD 39 ICH S12 Guideline 2 studies entail the use of analytical methods to detect the GT product and transferred genetic 40 mate rial in collected samples and can include methods to detect the express ion product of the 41 transferred genetic material. 42 3. TIMING OF NONCLINICAL BD ASSESSMENT 43 Prelim inary BD data obtained at an early stage of a nonclinical development programme can 44 potentially aid in species selection for subsequent pharmacology and toxicology studies (see 45 Section 4.3). In addition, BD data should be available when evaluating and interpret ing the 46 nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology findings . Nonclinical BD data can also inform design 47 aspects of a first-in-human clinical trial (see Section 6), thus it is important that nonclinical BD 48 assessment be completed prior to initiation of the clinical trial. 49 4. DESIGN OF NONCLINICAL BD STUDIES 50 4.1. General Considerations 51 BD studies can be conducted as stand -alone BD studies or in conjunction with nonclinical 52 pharmacology and toxicology studies (see Section 5.3). Therefore, in this document the term 53 \"BD study \" represents either scenario. Nonclinical BD assessment should be performed in a 54 biologically relevant animal species (see Section 4.3) following administration of a GT product 55 that is representative of the intended clinical product (see Section 4.2 for possible alternate 56 scenarios). It is important that the route of administration (ROA) reflect the intended clinical 57 ROA to the extent possible and that the dose levels studied provide sufficient characterisation 58 of the BD profile (see Section 4.5). 59 It is important to verify the data quality, integrity, and reliability of the BD evaluation. In 60 principle, nonclinical BD studies that are not conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory 61 Practice (GLP) are accept ed; however, when BD evaluation is performed as part of a GLP - 62 compliant toxicology study, it is important that all in-life parameters and sample collection 63 procedures remain in compliance with GLP. 64 4.2. Test Article 65 The test article administered in the nonclinical BD studies should be representative of the 66 intended clinical GT product, taking into consideration the manufacturing process, important 67 product characteristics (e.g., titre), and the final clinical formulation (see Section 5.7). In some 68 situations, nonclinical BD data generated with a GT product that consists of the clinical vector 69 containing a different therapeutic transgene or an expression marker gene (e.g., adeno - 70 associated virus vector of the same serotype and promoter with a fluorescent marker protein 71 expression cassette) can be leveraged to support the BD profile (see Section 5.8). 72 4.3. Animal Species or Model 73 BD assessment should be conducted in a biologically relevant animal species or model that is 74 permissive for transfer and expression of the genetic material. Selection factors can include 75 species differences in tissue tropism, gene transfer efficienc y, and transgene expression in target 76 ICH S12 Guideline 3 and non-target tissues/cells. If working with a replication competent vector, it is important that 77 the animal species or model be permissive to vector replication. 78 The influence of species , sex, age, physiologic condi tion (i.e., healthy animal vs. animal disease 79 model) on the BD profile can also be important. In addition, the potential for the animal species 80 to mount an immune response against the administered vector and/or expression product should 81 be considered (see Section 5.4). BD data generated from preliminary studies evaluating gene 82 transfer efficiency or assay methodologies can aid justification of an appropriate animal species 83 selected for comprehensive BD assessment in subsequent studies . 84 4.4. Group Size and Sex of Animals 85 An appropriate number of animals per sex (as applicable) should be evaluated at each 86 predetermined sampling time point to generate sufficient data that support comprehensive BD 87 assessment (see Section 4.6). General recommendation s on the number of animals are presented 88 in Note 1. In keeping with the principles of the 3Rs, the total number of animals can be an 89 aggregate from several studies. Justification should be provided for the numbers of animals 90 evaluated at each time point , as well as the use of combined data from multiple studies , as 91 applicable . Justification should also be provided when only one sex is evaluated . 92 4.5. Route of Administration and Dose Level Selection 93 The ROA of the GT product can affect the BD profile, including the cell types that are 94 transduced and the immune response. Therefore, the GT product should be administered using 95 the intended clinical ROA, as feasible (see Note 2). 96 The selected dose levels of the administered GT product should provide adequate 97 characte risation of the BD profile to aid in interpretation of the pharmacology and toxicology 98 assessments. The highest dose level administered should be the expected maximum dose level 99 in the toxicology studies (usually limited by animal size, ROA/anatomic target , or GT product 100 concentration). However, with appropriate justification, the anticipated maximum clinical dose 101 level can also serve as the highest dose level for BD evaluation . 102 4.6. Sample Collection 103 The sample collection procedure for target and non-target tissues and biofluids should be 104 designed to minimise the potential for contamination. It is important to follow a pre-specified 105 process that includes appropriate archiving of the samples obtained from each animal (vehicle 106 control and those administered the GT product), as well as documenting the order of sample 107 collection. Sample collection time points should reflect the anticipated time following GT 108 product administration to reach peak, steady -state (i.e., plateau), and declining (if feasible) GT 109 produ ct levels in target and non-target tissues/biofluids. Additional time points can be included, 110 as applicable, to more comprehensively capture the length of the steady -state period and to 111 estimate persistence. Inclusion of time points to permit evaluation of GT product level s after 112 repeat administration should be considered , when applicable. 113 ICH S12 Guideline 4 For replication competent vectors, sample collection time points should also cover the detection 114 of the second peak level due to vector replication and the subsequent clearance phase. 115 The collected samples should include the following core panel of tissues/biofluids: blood, 116 injection site(s), gonads, adrenal gland, brain, spinal cord (cervical, thoracic, and lumbar), liver, 117 kidney, lung, heart, and spleen. This core panel can be expanded depending on additional 118 considerations, such as vector type/tropism, express ion product, ROA, disease 119 pathophysiology, and animal sex and age. For example, additional tissues/biofluids can include 120 peripheral nerves, dorsal root ganglia, cerebrospinal fluid, vitreous fluid, draining lymph nodes, 121 bone marrow, and/or eyes and optic nerve. The decision as to the final sample collection panel 122 should be guided by an understanding of the GT product, the target clinical population, and 123 existing nonc linical data. 124 In cases where systemic exposure is not anticipated (e.g., sub-retinal administration) or no 125 leakage from the site of administration can be demonstrated, justification for the selection of a 126 specific panel of tissues/biofluids can be provided . 127 Collected samples can also be analysed for presence of the expression product . Considerations 128 regarding this assessment are provided in Section 5.2. 129 5. SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS 130 5.1. Assay Methodologies 131 Evaluation of the BD profile necessitates quantitating the amount of genetic material 132 (DNA/RNA) of the GT product in tissues/biofluids and, if appropriate, expression products . 133 Currently, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is considered the 'gold 134 standard' for measurement of specific DNA (or, with a reverse transcription step, RNA as well) 135 presence in tissues/biofluids. Quantification of nucleic acid sequences is important for assessing 136 the relative amount of genetic material from a GT product and determin ing the kinetics of its 137 accumulation or decay. The limit of sensitivity and reproducibility of the quantification method 138 should be established and documented. Spike and recovery experiments, considered part of 139 assay development, should be performed to demonstrate the ability to detect the target sequence 140 in different tissues/biofluids. Other techniques can be used in nonclinical studies to monitor BD 141 of a vector and/or the expression products. These include , but are not flow cytometry; various in vivo and ex vivo imaging 144 techniques; and other evolving technologies. It is important to provide a comprehensive 145 description of the methodology and the justification for the technique used, including the 146 performance parameters of the method. 147 5.2. Measurement of Expression Products 148 While quantification of the genetic material of the GT produc t is the primary BD assessment 149 (see Section 5.1), determination of the level of expression products in different tissues/biofluids 150 can contribute to characterisation of the safety and activity profiles following GT product 151 administration. Decisions regarding the conduct of such assessments should be based on the 152 ICH S12 Guideline 5 extent of nonclinical BD analyses needed for the GT product, which is determined using a risk- 153 based approach. This approach can include consideration of the GT product levels and 154 persistence in tissues/biofluids; the target clinical population; and potential safety concerns 155 associated with the vector and/or the expression product. 156 5.3. Nonclinical BD Assessment as a Component of Pharmacology and Toxicology Studies 157 In addition to stand -alone studies, BD assessment can also be performed as part of nonclinical 158 pharmacology and toxicology studies. In such scenarios, BD assessment should follow the 159 recommendations specified in Section 4. In cases where certain recommendations cannot be 160 met in a single study (e.g., number of animals per group or collection of a pre-determined panel 161 of tissues/biofluids from each animal), BD data shou ld be obtained from several studies (see 162 Section 4.4). 163 5.4. Immunogenicity 164 Pre-existing immunity in animals, notably in non-human primates and other non-rodent species, 165 against a GT vector could affect the BD profile. Screening of animals for pre-existing immunity 166 to the vector prior to inclusion in a nonclinical study should be considered. Ideally, selection of 167 animals determined to be negative for pre-existing immunity with appropriate testing is 168 preferred but may not always be feasible. In such situatio ns, it is important that this aspect is 169 factored into the non-biased method used to randomise animals to study groups. 170 In certain cases, due to the species -specific nature of the expression product, the animal may 171 mount a cell-mediated or humoral immune response to the expression product. Cell-mediated 172 immune respon se to the vector may also occur after administration of the GT product . This 173 response may result in a BD profile that is not informative. If such a situation is anticipated, 174 sponsors can consider collection and archiving of appropriate samples for possible 175 immunogenicity analysis to support interpretation of the BD data. 176 Immunosuppression of animals for the sole purpose of evaluating the BD profile is not 177 recommended. However, if product - or species -specific circumstances warrant 178 immunosuppression , justification should be provided. Use of a species -specific surrogate 179 transgene can also be considered to circumvent effects of the immune response in some 180 situation s. 181 5.5. Ex vivo Genetically Modified Cells 182 Considerations for BD assessment of GT products that consist of ex vivo genetically modified 183 cells (i.e., cells that are transduced/transfected ex vivo and then administered to the 184 animal/human subject) should include factors such as the cell type, ROA, and the potential for 185 the express ion product or gene modification event to affect the expected distribution of the cells 186 within the body (e.g., new or altered expression of cell adhesion molecules ). In addition, the 187 occurrence of graft versus host disease in animals can complicate interpretation of BD 188 assessment of genetically modified human T cells. In general, BD assessment of ex vivo 189 genetically modified cells of haematopoietic origin is not critical based on expected widespread 190 ICH S12 Guideline 6 distribution following systemic administration . If distribution to a target organ(s) /tissue (s) is 191 expected , BD assessment should be considered . 192 5.6. BD Assessment in Gonadal Tissues 193 It is important to conduct BD assessme nt of the administered GT product in the gonads for both 194 sexes unless the target clinical population is restricted to one sex (e.g., for the treatment of 195 prostate cancer). If the vector or the transferred genetic material signal does not indicate 196 persisten ce by an appropriate analytical method (see Section s 4.6 and 5.1), further evaluation 197 may not be necessary. Persistent presence of GT product in gonads can lead to additional studies 198 to determine GT product levels in germ cells (e.g., oocytes, sperm) in the animals. These data, 199 as well as other factors (vector type, replication capacity, integration potential, dose level, ROA, 200 etc.) can inform the risk of inadvertent germline integration. Refer to ICH Considerations 201 document (1) for a more comprehensive discussion on this issue. GT product detection in non- 202 germline cells (e.g., leukocytes, Sertoli cells, Leydig cells) can warrant additional consideration 203 of the function of the affected non-germline cells, particularly if the cell type is important to 204 successful reproduction. 205 5.7. Triggers for Additional Nonclinical BD Studies 206 Although nonclinical BD assessment for a GT product is determined prior to a first-in-human 207 clinical trial, various circumstances may elicit the conduct of additional studies for BD 208 assessment . Examples of possible scenarios are provided below: 209 A significa nt change in the clinical development programme, such as: a change 210 in the ROA; an increase in the GT product dose level that significantly exceed s 211 the maximum nonclinical dose level tested; changes in the dosing regimen; and 212 inclusion of another clinical indication that includes both sexes instead of the 213 originally -proposed single sex. Additional BD assessment can be incorporated 214 into any additional pharmacology and/or toxicology studies that are performed. 215 A significant change in the vector structure or serotype, and any other 216 modifications that may result in changes in tropism. 217 Changes in the manufacturing process that can affect the final GT product 218 formulation (e.g., addition of excipients that could alter vector tropism) or 219 relevant quality attributes of the GT product (e.g., empty to full capsid ratios, in 220 vitro gene transfer activity , product titre). Other factors to consider about 221 manufacturing changes include vector particle size; aggregation state; 222 antigenicity; and potential interaction with other host components (e.g., serum 223 factors). 224 5.8. Circumstances when Nonclinical BD Studies may not be Needed or are not Feasible 225 Existing BD data obtained from nonclinical studies conducted with the same GT product in 226 support of a different clinical indication can potentially suffice for a new clinical population. 227 However, considerations such as the dose level(s) , dosing regimen , ROA, and change in 228 promotor will factor into this decision. BD data obtained with a previously characterised GT 229 product that has the same vector structure and other characteristics that determine its tissue/cell 230 ICH S12 Guideline 7 tropism, but a different trans cribed/translated product , can also potentially support waiving an 231 additional nonclinical BD study. Justification should be provided for this approach. 232 In some cases, a biologically relevant animal species that can inform the BD profile in the 233 clinical population does not exist. For example, when the vector binds to the target molecule 234 on human cells but this target is absent on animal cells. In such circumstances, it is important 235 to provide a comprehensive discussion of the issue and justification to support an alternative 236 approach to evaluation of nonclinical BD. 237 6. APPLICATION OF NONCLINICAL BD STUDIES 238 Characterisation of the BD profile following administration of a GT product in animals is a 239 critical component of a nonclinical development programme. The nonclinical BD data 240 contribute to the overall interpretation of the study findings to enable a better understanding of 241 the relationship of various findings (desired and undesired) to the administered GT product. 242 Attribution of findings observed in the dosed animals to the genetic material (DNA/RN A) 243 and/or to the expression product factor into ascertaining a potential benefit: risk profile of the 244 GT product before administration in humans. It is important to consider the relevancy of the 245 BD data to the clinical population based on factors such as the ROA, dose level(s), dosing 246 regimen, and animal immune response . These data can also inform elements of a first-in-human 247 trial and subsequent clinical trials, such as the dosing procedure (i.e., dosing intervals between 248 subject s), the monitoring plan, and long-term follow -up assessment . 249 NOTES 250 1. In general, it is recomme nded that a minimum of 5 rodents or 3 non-rodents per 251 sex/group/time point be evaluated; however, inclu sion of equivalent numbers for each 252 sex may not be critical . Justification for these decision s should be provided. 253 2. For each delivery device system used, it is important to provide data that verify the 254 volume and dose level of the administered GT product in animals. This information can 255 affect interpretation of the resulting BD profile. If a novel delivery device system is 256 planned for use in clinical trials , consider collect ing BD data in conjunction with the 257 pharmacology and/or toxicology studies conducted with the device system or its 258 equivalent. 259 GLOSSARY 260 BD: 261 Biodistribution . 262 263 Expression products: 264 Molecules such as RNA and protein, produced in the cells guided by the transferred 265 genetic materials. 266 267 Gene therapy (GT) products: 268 Therapeutic products that mediate their effect by the expression (transcription/transla- 269 tion) of transferred genetic materials, or by specifically altering the target genome of 270 human cells. This definition is for the purpose of this guideline. 271 ICH S12 Guideline 8 Gene transfer: 272 Delivery of therapeutic genetic material into the cells using vectors (e.g. transduction 273 for viral vectors and transfection for plasmids). 274 275 ROA: 276 Route of administration. 277 278 Transgene: 279 Transcriptionally or translationally active genet ic material intended to be deliv ered into 280 cells with therapeutic purpose .
