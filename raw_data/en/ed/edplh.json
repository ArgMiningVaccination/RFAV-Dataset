They are mental intrusions, efforts from free-floating energies or specific people, to enter your psyche and make some kind of detrimental impact or extract information. Try not to fear since 1) the greatest defense tool is the power of love and light; 2) negative energies thrive in the presence of additional negative energies, like fear. This article provides guidance for protection using principles of love and positivity. Some psychic attacks require embodied warrior energy and/or the assistance of professional healers and shamans. Five Signs of a Psychic Attack - Disabling fear or anxiety - Nightmares or night terrors, often involving attacks - Extreme fatigue - Emotional or spiritual paralysis - Questioning your path, values or sanity Five Practices to Protect Yourself From Psychic Attacks 1. Clearing Ceremony Use plant medicine, like sage, and crystal allies to clear negative energy and spirits from your environment and energetic field. There are many variations of these ceremonies: try buying white sage and sweet grass. Burn the white sage and brush the smoke around your whole body then continue to fan the smoke around your house and particularly around your bed, if you have night terrors. While you sage yourself and your environment, concentrate on the banishing or removal of negative or dark energy by holding light and love in your mind's eye. Next, repeat the process with sweet grass. As you bless yourself and your space with sweet grass, invite in positive energy, guiding spirits, love and any other I release negative energies so that I may serve my higher purpose. 2. Cord Cutting and Earth Cording Try the powerful practice of cord-cutting at night and Earth cording during the day. Before you go to bed, imagine a cord between yourself and any person or thing that comes to mind, the cord originating from your belly. Using a pair of imaginary scissors, cut the cord between yourself and any external energy that you envision. You can envision this as a series of cords or perform the exercise cord-by-cord. In the morning, just after you awake, envision a cord connecting you, from your belly to the center of the Earth. The cord is strong, flexible, omnipresent, and nurturing. Prior to bed, as you cut cords, say this intention aloud: I release energetic attachments so that I may serve my higher purpose. Saltwater can also be used for a more powerful ceremony. Begin by gathering all the energetic chords from your chakras into one handful. Using the other hand, slice the air between your body and the handful, and dump the chords into the saltwater. Repeat again with the chords coming out of your back chakras. 3. Surround Yourself in Light Visualization meditations offer powerful protection and support, and most importantly, a reminder that the source is with you. Envision your heart space as a white flame. Watch the flame expand and grow, as the white light emanates outward from your heart to your extremities, then beyond. You are surrounded by a large white light that does not originate from behind you but rather from inside you. Repeat this mantra during this practice: I am divinely guided and protected. I am light. I am love. 4. Strengthen Your Auric Field Deeply rooted in Eastern philosophy, the auric field is the pulsing vibration or energy around a being. It can extend up to 25 feet in all directions from your body and is a colorful combination of all your chakras. Your aura may change, depending on your surroundings, yet as a divine being, you are able to cultivate the strength of your aura as an energetic boundary. In fact, you are accountable for what you allow in and out of your auric field. While standing, envision the placement and colors of each chakra, from red at your feet to violet at your crown, beating and circling like great wheels. Imagine the wheels growing in size until they begin to merge into a beautiful tie-dyed circle around your being. One color may emerge as your primary auric color. Envision this field around you and remember that you may control the two-way permeability of this field: you may let in what you wish, and send out what you wish. Repeat the mantra below during this meditation: I let positive energy in and deflect negative energy. I am radiant. 5. Dream Work Since psychic attacks often happen while people are sleeping, and manifest as night terrors or nightmares, working with your dream world is an efficient tactic for addressing psychic attacks. Write in a dream journal and document your thoughts upon awakening and memories of your dreams. Prior to falling asleep, ask to remember your dreams, for your dreams to be of light and love, and call in your ancestral or spirit guides to protect you in the nebulous landscape of your dreams. You may also try playing binaural beats as you fall asleep, lulling you into a state of deep relaxation. Repeat this mantra before bed: Ancestors and spirit guides, please guide and protect me in my dream Next Article IONS Study Finds Clairvoyants 'See' Reiki Healing in Action A groundbreaking new study shows that people with clairvoyant abilities can see energy healing take place. The implications for both the understanding of these extra-sensory abilities and the healing field- are profound. The Institute of Noetic Sciences, or [IONS](https://noetic.org/), has just released the results of an important study that shows that [energy healing](/topic/energy-healing) works and that clairvoyants can pick up information about the healing by using their extended perception. Dr. Helan\u00e8 Wahbeh is the [head of research](https://noetic.org/profile/helane-wahbeh/) at IONS and the study lead. \"Clairvoyance essentially is the experience of being able to see things around people \u2014 see within their body and around their body \u2014 and gain information in a way that is beyond our normal sight,\" Wahbeh said. \"Sometimes this shows up as colors, sometimes people can see illness in other's bodies; what might be called ' [medical intuition](/video/medical-intuition-1).' Anyone can learn how to be a clairvoyant seer, in fact, there are people who teach medical intuitive classes. I've talked to many teachers who say '[A]s long as the person believes that they can, they can actually learn how to do this.' That doesn't mean that everyone is going to be excellent at it, but that the baseline level skill is learnable by anyone who is willing to try and believes that they can.\" Researchers sought to examine these abilities within the context of a study of Reiki, a popular Japanese energy healing modality. In the study, 40 participants with varying health issues were given half-hour Reiki sessions, which were then shown to improve their wellbeing. While the sessions were taking place, a group of six experienced clairvoyant seers observed. "}
