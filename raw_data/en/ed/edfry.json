This edition builds upon and replaces previous versions of the Ag Guide published in 1988, 1999, and 2010. The Ag Guide is published jointly by the American Dairy Science Association (ADSA), the American Society of Animal Science (ASAS), and the Poultry Science Association (PSA). The Ag Guide comprises subject-oriented chapters covering subjects that per- tain to all the agricultural animal species (chapters 1 to 5) and species chapters, which fall under the pur- view of the respective association(s) dedicated to the species (chapters 6 to 13). Each association appoint- ed a senior editor to steer the revision of their respec- tive species chapters and to collaborate with the se- nior editors from the other associations to guide the writing and revision of the subject-oriented chapters. Committees charged with the writing and revi- sion of the species-specific chapters were recruited by the respective professional associations devoted to the species. In addition, up to two individuals identified by each association were selected for each of the subject-oriented chapter committees, which thus comprised representatives from the three as- sociations. The individuals recruited were scientists, veterinarians, or engineers with expertise in the spe- cies or subjects covered in their respective chapters. Each chapter committee selected a chairperson from its membership to coordinate revisions and interact with the senior editors. The chapter committees searched the scientific lit- erature to include new research published since the third edition of the Ag Guide. The Ag Guide senior editors reviewed the chapters before accepting final drafts. Each society was responsible for the peer re- view of the respective species-specific chapters, with reviewers drawn from peers and the society boards of directors. The boards of directors of each asso- ciation reviewed and approved final drafts of the general chapters, as well as their respective species chapters. After these approvals, the chapters were compiled into the first draft of the fourth edition of the Ag Guide. All chapters were updated, revised, or rewritten, with the extent of revision of any given chapter determined by progress in the academic lit- erature pertaining to subjects covered in the chapter. Three new poultry chapters were written, covering meat-type poultry, egg-type poultry, and waterfowl to reflect the diversity of species, phenotypes, and uses among avian agricultural animals, replacing the single chapter on poultry in the third edition of the Ag Guide. The board-approved first draft of the Ag Guide was made available to the membership of ADSA, ASAS, and PSA, institutional animal care and use commit- tees (IACUCs), and other users of the Ag Guide, and to the public for a 75-day period of comment. After all submitted comments had been considered, the 4th edition of the Ag Guide was produced and made available on the ADSA, ASAS, and PSA websites. The Ag Guide covers agricultural animal species having different phenotypes within species and that are housed in assorted management systems across widely varying climates. The content must be suf- ficiently broad to cover the diverse research and teaching institutions that use agricultural animals, yet be clear enough to give unambiguous guidance to IACUCs responsible for the care and use of ani- mals in their respective institutions. The terms must, should, and recommend , which were introduced in the third edition of the Ag Guide, have been clarified in this edition to mean the following when used in reference to a specific animal care and use practice: Must indicates that the animal care and use must be as stated; should indicates that the animal care and use ought to be as indicated unless otherwise justi- fied; recommend indicates an appropriate way of do- ing things but leaves room for other approaches that achieve the same result. The Ag Guide is not intended to be simply a set of provisions on how agricultural animals are to be housed and managed. Although many of the spe- cies chapters have standards for such things as floor space, feeder space, and drinker allocations because these metrics have been verified by scientific study PREFACE xand long practice, other animal care practices do not lend themselves to prescriptive stipulation. It is essential that IACUCs and others who oversee ani- mal care practices exercise professional judgment to encourage appropriate animal welfare outcomes to be achieved, rather than merely seeking to apply specific housing and management requirements. An overly prescriptive approach to animal care and use can stifle research progress and teaching opportuni- ties. The US Government Principles for the Utiliza-tion and Care of Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing, Research, and Training (1985; Appendix 1) are en - dorsed in this guide as a basis for professional judg- ments about the appropriate treatment and use of ag- ricultural animals in research and teaching activities. Senior Editors: Cassandra B. Tucker (ADSA); Michael D. MacNeil (ASAS); A. Bruce Webster (PSA)xi PREFACE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020The Guide for the Care and Use of Agricultural Ani- mals in Research and Teaching (the Ag Guide) strongly affirms that scientific and professional judgment and concern for the humane treatment of animals are re- quired for the proper care of animals used in research and teaching. Scientists, veterinarians, and others must assume responsibility for animal welfare and uphold the rigor and integrity of agricultural animal research and instruction. The use of animals for research and teaching, including production research, is governed by numerous federal and local laws, regulations, and stan- dards. In the United States, the Animal Welfare Act (AWA, 1990) and Title 9 Part 1A of the Code of Federal Regulations (USDA, 1985) apply, whereas in Europe, the European Convention for the Protection of Verte- brate Animals used for Experimental and Other Scien- tific Purposes (ETS123; Council of Europe, 1986) and subsequent amendments apply (Directive 2010/63/EU; European Union, 2010). A repository of international animal research regulations is available (AAALAC, 2018). Compliance with these laws, regulations, poli- cies, and standards (or subsequent revised versions) in the establishment and implementation of an animal care program must be met. Other countries have also developed laws and guidelines for the use of animals in research, with many continuing to evolve (Odgen et al., 2016). Because a variety of management systems and physical accommodations may be used for agricultural animals, an understanding of the husbandry needs of each species and of the particular requirements of agri- cultural research and teaching is essential for an effec- tive institutional program of agricultural animal care and use (Stricklin and Mench, 1994; Granstrom, 2003). Critical components of such a program should include (1) clearly established lines of authority and respon- sibility; (2) an active and knowledgeable institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC); (3) proce- dures for self-monitoring of the IACUC through regu- lar (e.g., semi-annual) review of programs and facility oversight by the institutional officer; (4) appropriately maintained facilities for proper management, hous- ing, and support of animals; (5) an adequate program of veterinary care; and (6) training and occupational health programs for individuals who work with the animals (Curtis, 1994; Tillman, 1994; ARENA-OLAW, 2002; CIOMS-ICLAS, 2012). This chapter is intended to guide the development of institutional policies and programs for agricultural animal care and use. MONITORING THE CARE AND USE OF AGRICUL TURAL ANIMALS Each institution should establish an agricultural ani- mal care and use program with clearly designated lines of authority in accordance with this guide and in com- pliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and policies. The chief executive officer, in- stitutional official, or responsible administrative official of the institution should appoint a committee (known as the institutional animal care and use committee or IACUC) to monitor the care and use of agricultural animals in agricultural research and teaching activities within the institution. The IACUC should be composed of individuals who are qualified by experience or train- ing to evaluate the programs and proposals for agricul- tural animal research and should include individuals from each of the following categories: a scientist who has experience in agricultural re- search or teaching involving agricultural animals; an animal, dairy, or poultry scientist who has training and experience in the management of ag- ricultural animals; a veterinarian who has training and experience in agricultural animal medicine and who is licensed or eligible to be licensed to practice veterinary medicine; a person whose primary concerns are in an area outside of science (e.g., a faculty member from a non-science department, a staff member, a stu- dent, or an institutional administrator); a person who is not affiliated with the institution and who is not a family member of an individual affiliated with the institution (e.g., a member of the clergy or a community member). This public member is intended to provide representation for general community interests in the proper care and treatment of animals and should not be a per- son who uses animals in agricultural or biomedical CHAPTER 1: INSTITUTIONAL POLICIES 1research or teaching activities at the institution; and other members as required by institutional needs and applicable laws, regulations, policies, and granting or research funding agencies or groups. Because of experience and training, one individual may be able to fulfill more than a single role on the IACUC, but the committee should not have fewer than 5 mem- bers. This committee may also monitor the care and use of laboratory animals at the institution, provided that the special membership requirements outlined above are met. This recommendation can be fulfilled by several different types of committee structures, in- cluding a single institutional committee or unit com- mittees (e.g., departmental, college, or program) that review agricultural and biomedical research that uses agricultural animals. The overriding goal should be to facilitate a centralized, uniform, and high-quality over- sight of the institution's animal care program. The IACUC should meet at regular intervals to en- sure that the use of agricultural animals in research and teaching programs is humane, appropriate, and in ac- cordance with this guide. Meetings of the IACUC need not always be conducted in person. Electronic tech- nology, including web-based or telecommunications, can allow the committee to function appropriately. Such communications must be held with a quorum of members in real time and provide the same interactive opportunities as a face-to-face meeting. The IACUC should work with investigators to resolve issues while ensuring animal care, taking into account the investiga- tors' expertise with a particular species. The IACUC is authorized to review and approve or disapprove protocols and other proposed activities, or propose signicant changes in activities, related to agricultural ani- mal care and use in research and teaching; conduct, at minimum, semi-annual inspection of active agricultural animal facilities and study ar- eas, review the overall agricultural animal care and use program, and provide a written report to the responsible institutional official regarding the institution's compliance with this guide (including expected dates of correction for detected issues and minority views of the IACUC, should they occur); investigate reports of noncompliance or animal care concerns involving agricultural animals at the facility; suspend activities involving agricultural animals when not in compliance with approved proto- cols or written operating procedures (see section: Written Operating Procedures); make recommendations regarding the develop- ment and implementation of institutional policies and procedures to facilitate, support, and moni-tor the humane and appropriate use of animals in agricultural research and teaching, as well as any other aspect of the agricultural animal care program; and perform other functions that may be required by institutional need and by applicable laws, regula- tions, and policies. Other useful information about IACUC functions and training can be found in Prentice et al. (1992), the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee Guide- book (ARENA-OLAW, 2002), the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH, 2015), Animal Welfare Act information reposi- tory (USDA, 2018), Oki et al. (1996), Silverman et al. (2006), and Greene et al. (2007). PROTOCOL REVIEW The review of research and teaching activities using animals is one of the most important functions of the IACUC. Animal use protocol(s) (AUP) describing these activities must be reviewed before the initiation of the research or teaching activity to determine whether the proposed care and use of animals is appropriate and hu- mane. Approval of the AUP may be granted, withheld pending modifications, or denied. The IACUC should perform an annual review and renewal of approved AUP with resubmission and re-approval at least once every 3 years. The IACUC may choose to re-review an AUP at any time as deemed necessary. The following topics should be considered in the preparation and re- view of animal care protocols: Objectives and signicance of the research or teaching activity. Unnecessary duplication of previous studies. Availability or appropriateness of alternative pro- cedures or models (e.g., less invasive procedures, cell or tissue culture, or computer simulations) for the proposed research or teaching activity. It should be noted, however, that hands-on training involving animals is an important component of agricultural research and teaching (Vemulapalli et al., 2017); additionally, there is no substitute of another animal or simulation for production re- search. Aspects of the proposed experiment or demon- stration having to do directly with animal care and use, including justication for the species and strain of animal used; justication for the number of animals used; description of procedures that may cause discomfort, distress, or pain; and meth- ods of alleviating discomfort, distress, or pain in- cluding anesthesia, analgesia, tranquilizers, and nonpharmacologic means, as well as justication for any procedures that involve unalleviated pain, discomfort, or distress.2 CHAPTER 1: INSTITUTIONAL POLICIES Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020 Appropriateness of procedures and post-procedur- al care. Criteria and process for timely intervention, re- moval of animals from a study, or euthanasia if painful and stressful outcomes are anticipated (endpoint criteria). Unusual husbandry requirements (Note: describ- ing a procedure as a \"standard farm operating practice\" may be acceptable if the institution's written operating procedure is being used or if the practice is needed to serve as an appropriate control). Aspects of animal husbandry not covered under written operating procedures (see section on Writ- ten Operating Procedures). Method of euthanasia and disposition of the ani- mal. Responsibilities, training, and qualications of the researchers, teachers, students, and animal care personnel involved in the proposed activities. The US Government Principles for the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing, Research, and Training (Appendix 1 of this guide) state that \"Procedures involving animals should be designed and performed with due consideration of their relevance to human or animal health, the advancement of knowl- edge, or the good of society\" (Vemulapalli et al., 2017). Because IACUCs are NOT constituted to function as scientific peer-review committees, the IACUC should be judicious in reviewing the merit of proposed research and teaching activities (Mann and Prentice, 2004). In- stitutions should consider developing other mechanisms for peer merit review of research projects that have not already been reviewed by outside agencies. Although qualified peer review of research and teaching is impor- tant to consider, such peer review does not eliminate the need for the IACUC to thoughtfully review animal use. Institutions must develop policies for animal care and use related to research conducted off site as well as research using privately owned animals on and off site. The fact that research is conducted off site does not lessen the responsibility of the institution to assure ap- propriate and humane animal care and use. Investigators are encouraged to work with IACUCs for assistance in refining their protocols and proposed animal care and use practices. The common acceptance and use in animal agricul- ture of a production system, management practice, or routine procedure does not reduce the responsibility of every animal user to follow applicable laws, regula- tions, and policies, including the standards outlined in this guide. Exceptions to some provisions in this guide, however, may be justifiable to obtain new knowledge or to demonstrate methods commonly used in commercial agricultural animal production. For example, applied research and teaching may require the use of produc- tion practices that are consistent with those currently in use in the appropriate industry, even though such practices differ from those outlined in this guide. Also, research and teaching dealing with infectious diseases, toxins, or products of biotechnology may require spe- cial facilities. Exceptions to this guide should be stated explicitly in the AUP and be reviewed and approved by the IACUC. WRITTEN OPERATING PROCEDURES It is important to develop written animal care and husbandry policies and procedures for each unit in the program. Some husbandry practices may cause tempo- rary discomfort or pain. The IACUC must review and approve all operating procedures that have the poten- tial to cause pain or distress in animal care and hus- bandry. These procedures would then be available for reference in the AUP without having to be described separately for each study, experiment, or demonstra- tion. To be acceptable as written operating procedures, the procedures should sustain the long-term welfare of the animal and the animal handlers, be performed by or under the direct supervision of proficient person- nel, and be conducted with precautions taken to re- duce pain, stress, and infection. The written procedures must be filed in the appropriate administrative office and in locations accessible to individuals involved in carrying out these procedures. Husbandry procedures and production methods at agricultural research facilities should be revised as changes occur in the industry and when research dem- onstrates improvements. ANIMAL HEAL TH CARE Adequate health care and records must be main- tained for all agricultural animals used in research and teaching (see Chapter 2: Agricultural Animal Health Care). Institutional requirements will determine wheth- er full-time, part-time, or consulting veterinary services are appropriate. All euthanasia methods utilized should follow American Veterinary Medical Association guide- lines (AVMA, 2020) or be thoroughly considered by the IACUC before granting approval to ensure the animal incurs no undue pain or stress. BIOSECURITY It is essential that the agricultural animal care staff, researchers, students, and other associated individuals maintain a high standard of biosecurity to protect the animals from pathogenic organisms. For additional de- tails on biosecurity issues, see Chapter 3: Husbandry, Housing, and Biosecurity .3 CHAPTER 1: INSTITUTIONAL POLICIES Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS It is the responsibility of the institution to ensure that scientists, agricultural animal care staff, students, and other individuals who care for or use agricultural animals are qualified to do so through training or ex- perience. Appropriate supervision should be provided with training programs appropriate for animal user needs and information about the humane care and use of agricultural animals, including, if applicable, (1) husbandry needs, proper handling, surgical procedures, and pre- and post-procedural care; (2) methods to min- imize the number of animals used and techniques to minimize pain and distress, including the proper use of anesthetics, analgesics, tranquilizers, and nonphar- macologic methods; (3) methods for reporting deficien- cies in the animal care program; (4) use of information services such as the Animal Welfare Information Cen- ter at the National Agricultural Library (NRC, 1991; USDA-APHIS, 2018); and (5) methods of euthanasia. Records of participation in training programs should be maintained and available for review as needed. Employees who provide routine animal care should participate regularly in in-service education and train- ing relevant to their responsibilities. Formal or on-the- job training opportunities should be made available to all technical and husbandry support staff, including those who are temporary or part-time employees. It is recommended that the training program include in- formation provided by experts from a broad range of disciplines such as animal husbandry, behavior, nutri- tion, environmental physiology, experimental surgery, veterinary clinical and diagnostic medicine, agricultural engineering, instrumentation, and others as deemed ap- propriate. A variety of reference materials is available for use in training programs (Kreger, 1995; Underwood, 2005). In addition to having in-house training, it is desir- able for agricultural animal care staff to be profession- ally trained or certified. Many states have colleges with accredited programs in veterinary technology (AVMA, 2007). Technician and technologist certification is avail- able through the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science (AALAS; https://www.aalas.org/), although that program primarily emphasizes the care and use of laboratory animals rather than agricultural animals. Animal scientists with educational credentials ranging from the baccalaureate to the doctorate degree who seek recognition of their expertise in the biology and production of agricultural animals can be certi- fied through examination by the American Registry of Professional Animal Scientists (ARPAS; https://www. arpas.org/). OCCUPATIONAL HEAL TH An occupational health and safety program must be established for individuals who work with agricultural animals. The program should be consistent with fed-eral, state, and local regulations and will depend on the facilities, research activities, and hazards involved. The degree of participation by individuals in the program should be based on an assessment of risk by health and safety specialists involving consideration of the hazards posed by the animals and materials used; the duration, frequency, and intensity of exposure; the susceptibility of the personnel; and the history of occupational injury and illness in the particular workplace (Clark, 1993; Kerst, 2003; Wald and Stave, 2003). General guidelines for occupational health programs have been published by the National Research Coun- cil (NRC, 2011). The program for individuals working with agricultural animals may include a physical exam- ination before job placement, periodic medical evalua- tions for people in identified job categories, assessments of the workspaces to ensure protection from health haz- ards, and provision for treating illness or injury. The program should also include an educational component to teach personnel about agricultural animal and zoo- notic disease, physical hazards, and personal hygiene. Special precautions may be necessary for individuals who are at unusual risk (e.g., immunocompromised, having a temporary or long-term physical limitation, or pregnant). Additional training may be necessary if cer- tain chemicals, radiation, and other hazardous agents are part of an experimental protocol. It is important that all researchers, students, agri- cultural animal caretakers, and others be immunized against tetanus every 10 years based on the institu- tion's risk assessment. Prophylactic vaccinations should also be considered when research is being conducted on infectious diseases for which effective vaccines are available. Persons working with animals may develop allergies. The occupational safety and health program should identify high-risk areas with a potential for al- lergy development. Persons with known allergies should be provided personal protective equipment (PPE) to reduce or eliminate allergen exposure or avoid expo- sure to animals. Physical injuries constitute health haz- ards for individuals working with animals. Institutions should identify high-risk areas and tasks and should ed- ucate animal care personnel about methods for reduc- ing risk. Injuries can be minimized by providing train- ing in proper animal handling, lifting, and equipment use. Access to first aid and medical treatment should be readily available, and personnel should be trained and familiar with access procedures. Such access may include readily available and properly stocked first aid kits. Cases of animal bites and scratches should be documented and appropriate medical care provided as needed. Air quality assessments are recommended for animal care areas, and appropriate respiratory protec- tion should be provided for these individuals (OSHA, 2011). Caretakers working with agricultural animals in closed buildings should be afforded the option to use respirators or dust masks because they may develop respiratory problems, including chronic and irreversible lung damage (Kirkhorn and Garry, 2000).4 CHAPTER 1: INSTITUTIONAL POLICIES Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020Zoonoses can also be a serious risk. Personnel (in- cluding animal care staff, technicians, investigators, clinicians, students, maintenance workers, and securi- ty staff) who have contact with or an opportunity for contact with animals, their waste products, or tissues should be made aware of identified hazards (Acha and Szyfres, 2001, 2003; Fontes, 2008). Zoonotic disease in animal populations should be screened for or monitored regularly as appropriate. Information pertaining to the most common zoonotic diseases found in agricultural animals and the means by which they are spread can be found in the Merck Veterinary Manual (https://www. merckvetmanual.com/). The noise level in some animal facilities may be high. When personnel are exposed to noise exceeding local, state, or federal standards, appropriate protection pro- grams must be implemented (USDL OSHA, 1995). Work assignments and health records should be a part of an occupational health program. Occupational health program records are maintained under HIPAA guidelines and requirements. Records should be kept of individual work assignments and should include the date and time of injuries or unusual illnesses. Supervisors must inform personnel of potential health hazards, and personnel must notify their supervisor if a zoonosis occurs. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS Hazardous Materials The use of hazardous biological, chemical, or physical materials necessitates compliance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as compliance with guidelines issued by granting agencies and organizations. Insti- tutions should have written policies governing experi- mentation with hazardous materials and should ensure that staff members associated with research projects involving hazardous materials are qualified to assess the dangers to animals and humans and are capable of selecting appropriate safeguards. Special facilities and equipment may be required for certain hazardous ma- terials, and additional requirements exist for those bio- logical materials or toxins deemed as select agents by federal law. Further information about recommended practices and procedures can be found in publications by CDC-NIH (2000, 2007), CDC-FSAP (2005), and NRC (2011). Genetically Engineered, Gene Edited, and Cloned Animals As advancements in research drive the discovery and development of new technologies, consideration needs to be made for the care and use of agricultural animals in research and teaching. Institutions, researchers, and IACUCs should assure that assessment of animal care and use protocols reflects differences in animal tech- nologies (Dennis, 2000; Wells, 2005). Guidelines for re-search involving genetically engineered (GE) and gene edited (GEd) animals do not differ materially from those that apply to conventional animals used in re- search except under special conditions. The published scientific literature has not established the need for unique guidelines. The general standards of care associ- ated with GE or GEd agricultural animals should be the same as those applied to all agricultural animals in research unless the genetic modification requires altera- tion in management or environment to maintain animal welfare (Dennis, 2002). Clones of livestock animals that are not GE or GEd do not differ materially from non- clones and require no special considerations (Batchel- der et al., 2007). The animal biotechnology industry has guidelines for research and development with GE animals as a stewardship program (BIO, 2009). The BIO Guidance provides information for the development and imple- mentation of stewardship programs for all institutions and researchers that plan to engage in research and de- velopment, and possible commercialization, of GE ani- mals. The European Food Safety Authority (2012) has published an update on the welfare and environmental impact of food animals derived from cloning. Research Involving Genetic Engineering and Gene Editing of Agricultural Animals Genetic engineering of agricultural animals is the direct manipulation of an organism's genes, includ- ing heritable and nonheritable recombinant DNA constructs. Gene editing is the use of programmable nucleases such as TALENs (transcription activator- like effector nucleases) or the CRISPR/Cas 9 system that allows for the specific site-directed induction of a double-stranded DNA break, which can result in a tar- geted mutation (GEd) or insertion of a transgene (GE) (Petersen, 2018). Genetic engineering is different from traditional breeding, in which the organism's genes are manipulated indirectly. The genetic engineering of ag- ricultural animals has been extensively reviewed (NRC, 2002; CAST, 2009; Wheeler, 2007; Mur- ray and Maga, 2016), with the recent book by Nie- mann and Wrenzycki (2018) being a useful reference. For animals used in biomedical research, the needs for thermal comfort, humidity control, floor space, and ap- propriate nutrition and husbandry practices should be based on the standards outlined in this guide. Animals with certain genetic backgrounds may have special re- quirements that should be researched and documented to enable those responsible for animal care to be able to provide for the animals' comfort. Animal welfare for GE animals used in research is regulated by law in some jurisdictions, with regulations and guidelines es- tablished, for example, by the US Department of Agri- culture (USDA), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) 5 CHAPTER 1: INSTITUTIONAL POLICIES Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020in the United States, and, by the European Parliament in Europe. Specific information for US institutions can be obtained by reviewing the NIH guidelines for re- search involving recombinant DNA molecules (NIH, 2002), the Animal Welfare Act regulations overseen by USDA, and the US FDA Guidance 187 for industry that may be helpful in the conduct of research with GE animals (FDA, 2009). FDA Guidance 187 does not address GEd animals and is currently in revision, so at this time there are no regulations specifically in force that address GEd animal use, care, or welfare. Research Involving Cloning of Agricultural Animals Animal cloning (Vajta and Gjerris, 2006) is an as- sisted reproductive technology (FDA, 2008) similar to artificial insemination, embryo transfer, and in vitro fertilization. The current technique used for animal cloning is somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). There are no published US guidelines for unique requirements regarding the care and use of animal clones in research. The care and use of animal clones does not differ from that required for the animal from which the genotype is sourced. In addition, because the progeny of animal clones are not clones, progeny do not require special consideration. Disposition of GE Animals and Clones The disposition of GE animals and clones may be of interest to animal agriculture, stakeholders in the food chain, and the US government (FDA) because of issues involving the emergence of new policies by internation- al governments (Codex Alimentarius, 2008). Thus, it is recommended that institutions and researchers partici- pate in the Livestock Industry Clone Registry, whereby animal clones are registered in the database or registry. This registry is part of the Supply Chain Management program developed by livestock cloning companies to identify cattle and porcine clones in the United States.

Proper management is essential for the well-being of animals, the validity and effectiveness of research and teaching activities, and the health and safety of animal care personnel. Sound animal husbandry programs pro- vide systems of care that permit animals to grow, ma- ture, reproduce, express some species-specific behavior, and be healthy. Specific operating procedures depend on factors that are unique to individual institutions. Well-trained and motivated personnel can often achieve high-quality animal care with less than ideal physical facilities and equipment. ANIMAL PROCUREMENT When an institution acquires new animals, atten- tion must be paid to applicable international, federal, and state regulations and institutional procedures, par- ticularly those dealing with transportation and animal health. All animals must be obtained and transported legally. The program or attending veterinarian, in con- junction with the principal scientist, should formulate written procedures to assess the health status of a herd or flock obtained from a vendor before acquiring ani- mals. The institution should develop a mechanism and process of control for animal acquisition that ensures coordination of resources that will preclude the arrival of animals in advance of preparation of adequate hous- ing, nutrition, and appropriate veterinary quarantine procedures. Quality control for vendors and knowledge of the history of purchased animals is part of an ad- equate institutional veterinary care program. Animals of unknown origin or from stockyards should only be used if necessary; such animals may pose significant unknown health risks compared with animals of known origin, and therefore should be handled appropriately. Newly acquired animals should undergo a quarantine and acclimation period for preventive and clinical treat- ments as appropriate for their species health status. ACCLIMATION AND STABILIZATION Newly arrived animals require a period of acclima- tion. Acclimation refers to a stabilization period before animal use, which permits physiological and behavioral adaptation to the new environment. The veterinarian or their veterinary designee should establish general acclimation guidelines for each species. Any modifica- tions to the general program should be discussed with the attending veterinarian before animals are shipped. In some cases, animals may require an extended ac- climation period because of their history or health status. However, some studies, such as comparisons of metaphylactic treatments for bovine respiratory disease post-shipment, need to begin as soon as animals arrive. Such exemptions from the acclimation period must be scientifically justified and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC). QUARANTINE Quarantine is the separation of newly received ani- mals from those already in the facility or on the premises until the health of the new animals has been evaluated and found to be acceptable. The program veterinar- ian should ensure that quarantine facilities or locations are appropriate and that quarantine procedures are consistent with current veterinary practices and ap- plicable regulations. The quarantine period should be long enough to observe signs of infectious disease or obtain diagnostic evidence of infection status. Quaran- tine and testing of animals before introduction is espe- cially important for herds or flocks that have attained specific-pathogen-free status, but addition of animals should be discouraged in specific-pathogen-free herds or flocks. If the health history of newly received animals is unknown, the quarantine program should be more comprehensive and sufficiently long to allow expression or detection of diseases present in the early incubation stage. Exceptions to quarantine practices should be ap- proved by the attending veterinarian or their veterinary designee in advance of shipment of the animals. The program veterinarian, or skilled personnel un- der the direction of the program veterinarian, should perform an initial examination and subsequent daily observations of newly received animals. Animals should be observed in quarantine until they are cleared for in- troduction into a herd or facility. During the quarantine period, animals should be vaccinated and treated for CHAPTER 2: AGRICUL TURAL ANIMAL HEAL TH CARE 9diseases and parasites as appropriate to protect their health and maintain the health of animals in the home facility. In addition to having adequate quarantine pro- cedures, research facilities and animal use protocols should be designed to minimize the risk of introducing or transmitting disease agents. VETERINARY CARE Attending or Program Veterinarian An institution using agricultural animals in research or teaching should have an official with the credentials and authority to manage an institutional animal care program. The housing, feeding, and nonmedical care of such animals should be directed by a veterinarian or scientist trained and experienced in the proper care, handling, and use of each species of agricultural animal used. A qualified veterinarian must be responsible for the agricultural animal health care program. This per- son may be designated the attending or program vet- erinarian. Although this model may not be mandated for every institution, it is the position of the Ag Guide that every institution should have a model like it. The Institute for Laboratory Animal Research (ILAR)/Na- tional Research Council Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (The ILAR Guide; NRC, 2011) de- fines the attending veterinarian as a veterinarian \"with sufficient authority, including access to all animals and resources, to manage the program of animal care.\" The attending or program veterinarian is a resource who can give research personnel advice that ensures that humane needs of animals are met and that is, to the ex- tent possible, compatible with scientific requirements. Animal Welfare Act regulations and Public Health Service policy (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2015) require that the veterinarian serving in this role have the authority to oversee other aspects of animal care and use, including animal husbandry and nutrition, sanitation practices, zoonosis control, and hazard containment. Research and teaching institutions should provide investigators and instructors with access to a veteri- narian who has experience in the care of agricultural animals. The veterinarian can be full-time, part-time, or a private practitioner and should have capability to ensure that the provisions of the program are met. This program veterinarian should be provided access to all research and teaching animals and to any related docu- ments including health care records. The program vet- erinarian should also be involved in development and oversight of the veterinary care program. This includes providing oversight of all aspects of animal care and use such as protocol review, establishment of anesthetic and analgesic guidelines, development of study removal criteria, and responsible conduct of research activities. Veterinary involvement in these activities helps to en- sure animal health and welfare. The program veterinar-ian is not required to be the sole provider of veterinary care and can delegate authority to other qualified indi- viduals. However, the program veterinarian should be responsible for the veterinary care of all animals and should have frequent and direct communications with others providing care. The program veterinarian should utilize the expertise of other professionals when making determinations about agricultural animal care. Trained non-veterinary staff and study personnel listed on the approved IACUC protocol may administer treatments according to standard operating procedures approved by the program veterinarian. Preventive Medicine Adequate agricultural animal health care in research and teaching involves a written and implemented pro- gram for disease prevention, surveillance, diagnosis, treatment, and endpoint resolution. The objectives of such a program are to ensure animal health and wel- fare, minimize pain and distress, utilize animal pro- duction practices, prevent zoonosis, assist investigators on study-related animal health issues, and avoid con- taminants or residues in animal products. The program should include training for animal users regarding ani- mal behavior, production practices, humane and appro- priate restraint for the species involved, anesthesia, an- algesia, surgical and postsurgical care, and euthanasia. A mechanism for direct, frequent, and regular com- munication must be established among personnel who are responsible for daily animal care and observation, animal users, and the program veterinarian. This will help ensure that timely and accurate animal health in- formation is effectively communicated. Sick, Injured, and Dead Animals Animal care personnel must be trained to recognize signs of illness and injury. When appropriate, sick and injured animals should be segregated from the main group to protect them and the other animals, observed at least once daily, and provided with veterinary care as appropriate. When animals are separated, a mechanism should be in place to communicate to staff the status of the animals and to ensure proper daily, weekend, holiday, and emergency care. In some circumstances, segregation is not feasible or may disrupt the social hierarchy, cause additional stress to the animal, or ad- versely affect research. The advantages of segregation should be weighed against its disadvantages, especially for mild illnesses or injuries that can be easily managed. Care should be taken to minimize spread of pathogens from ill animals to healthy animals by observing ap- propriate biocontainment measures. Incurably ill or in- jured animals with unrelievable pain or distress should be killed in the most humane way as soon as possible by trained personnel. Unexpected deaths should be report- ed to the attending veterinarian or their designee. Dead 10 CHAPTER 2: AGRICULTURAL ANIMAL HEALTH CARE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020animals are potential sources of infection and should be disposed of promptly by a commercial rendering service or other appropriate means (e.g., burial, composting, or incineration), following applicable state and local ordinances and regulations. Postmortem examination of fresh or well-preserved animals may provide impor- tant animal health information and research data, and can aid in preventing further losses. When warranted and appropriate, waste and bedding removed from a site once occupied by a dead animal should be made inaccessible to other animals and the site disinfected appropriately. Medical Records An important component of an agricultural animal health program is maintaining records that can be used to monitor animal health events, both physical and be- havioral, as well as outcomes and levels of production. Medical records should comply with the American Col- lege of Laboratory Animal Medicine (www.aclam.org) statement on medical records (Field et al., 2007). Group health records may be appropriate for animals that are kept as cohorts (e.g., in a colony, school, flock, herd, or room), particularly because the animals under- go daily observation or evaluation by trained individu- als. The institution, in cooperation with the program veterinarian, should determine the method(s) by which medical records are maintained. Oversight of medical records is the responsibility of the principal investiga- tor, the program veterinarian, and the IACUC. When institutional representatives determine that a medical record should be created, the record typically contains the following information: 1. Identication of the animal(s) or group(s); 2. Observational information, such as the animal's behavior, results of physical examinations such as weight, and observed abnormalities, illnesses, or injuries; 3. Immunizations and other prophylactic treat- ments and procedures; 4. Documentation and interpretation of diagnostic tests when required; 5. Documentation of interventions by the research- er; 6. Treatments prescribed and administered; 7. Clinical response and follow-up information; 8. Descriptions of surgical procedures, anesthesia, analgesia, and perioperative care; 9. Methods used to control pain and distress; 10. Documentation of resolution; 11. Documentation of euthanasia or other disposi- tion; and 12. Necropsy ndings if necropsy is indicated. The record system must be structured so that infor- mation is easily collected, gathered, analyzed, summa- rized, and available to the veterinarian, the principal scientist, and the IACUC. The ACLAM statement on Medical Records for Animals Used in Research Teaching and Testing (Field et al., 2007) suggests that \"Nota- tions in the medical record should be made by individu- als who have administered treatments, or made direct observations or evaluations of the animal(s) or their di- agnostic results, or their designee. Individuals typically responsible for making notations in the record include veterinary staff (veterinarians or veterinary techni- cians), animal husbandry staff (animal care staff, man- agers, supervisors), and research staff (e.g., principal investigators, study directors or research technicians). All entries in the record should be dated, indicate the originator of the entry (e.g., initials, signature, and electronic signature) and be legible to someone other than the writer.\" SURGERY Multiple Major Surgical Procedures The ILAR Guide (NRC, 2011) differentiates major from minor surgery as follows: \"major survival surgery (e.g. laparotomy, thoracotomy, joint replacement, and limb amputation) penetrates and exposes the body cav- ity, and may produce substantial impairment of physi- cal or physiologic functions, or may involve extensive tissue dissection or transection. Minor survival surgery does not expose a body cavity, causes little or no physi- cal impairment and would include suturing, peripheral vessel cannulation, and percutaneous biopsy, routine agricultural animal procedures such as castration, and most procedures routinely done on an 'outpatient' ba- sis in veterinary clinical practice.\" Minimally invasive surgery such as laparoscopy may benefit the animal relative to traditional surgical techniques. Performance of more than one major survival surgery on a single animal is discouraged but may be necessary to ensure or maintain the health of the animal. Long- lived animals may undergo multiple major surgeries, such as a cow that requires surgery for correction of displaced abomasum and cesarean section for thera- peutic purposes. Multiple major survival surgeries per- formed for nontherapeutic reasons should be performed only when justified, as reviewed and approved by the IACUC. Multiple major surgeries that produce minor physiologic or physical impairment and reduce overall animal use, such as multiple endoscopic laparotomies in sheep for reproductive purposes, may be appropriate. Likewise, multiple surgical procedures may be justified when they are related components of the same project (e.g., cannulation of the digestive tract at several loca- Analgesia Painful animal husbandry-related procedures (stan- dard agricultural practices), such as castration, dehorn-11 CHAPTER 2: AGRICULTURAL ANIMAL HEALTH CARE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020ing, and tail docking, should be conducted with the use of pain management protocols appropriate for the age and species of animal involved. Details of these pro- cedures are provided in the species-specific chapters. The program veterinarian should advise investigators about the choice and use of analgesics, anesthetics, or any other pain- or distress-relieving measure. This may include recommended times for withholding of food and water to minimize the risk of adverse events such as vomiting or aspiration after anesthesia. After being trained and subsequently supervised by a qualified sci- entist or veterinarian, technical personnel may admin- ister anesthetics and analgesics as part of a research or teaching protocol. If a painful or distressing experimental procedure must be conducted without the use of an anesthetic or analgesic because such use would prevent collection of useful data, this must be scientifically documented in the animal care and use protocol and approved by the IACUC. In such cases, appropriately validated pain as- sessment methods should be used in conjunction with analgesic protocols (rescue analgesia) to manage pain and ensure that animal distress and suffering are mini- mized (Coetzee, 2011). Paralytic drugs (e.g., succinylcholine and other cu- rariform drugs) are not anesthetics. They must not be used unless animals are in a surgical plane of anesthesia and thus are unconscious. Use of paralytic agents must be justified in the animal use protocol, and appropriate ventilation and monitoring for depth of anesthesia must be described. Sedatives and tranquilizers are psychotropic sub- stances that alter mental processes or behavior but do not produce anesthesia or, in most cases, long-lasting analgesia (Coetzee, 2011). However, these medications can reduce the dose of anesthetic required. When used alone, tranquilizers should only be used to allay fear and anxiety. Their use may render restraint less stress- ful and enable animals to adapt more easily to novel situations. However, these compounds may not provide long-lasting pain relief, especially when pain is associ- ated with tissue damage and inflammation. Surgery Personnel Inappropriately performed surgical techniques or inadequate postoperative care will result in unneces- sary pain and distress. Experimental surgery on ag- ricultural animals should be performed or supervised by an experienced veterinarian or their designee, or by research scientists who are trained, highly skilled, and experienced in performing experimental surgery, in ac- cordance with established protocols approved by an IACUC. Researchers should seek input from a veteri- narian experienced in basic surgical techniques for the subject species when establishing surgical protocols to be approved by an IACUC. Institutions should provide basic surgical training and opportunities to upgrade surgical skills for persons who will conduct or assist with experimental surgery. The training program must be reviewed by the IACUC and under the direction of the program veterinarian or their designee. Training provided must be documented and the competency of personnel ensured. Surgical Facilities and Aseptic Technique Major survival surgeries should be performed in fa- cilities designed and prepared to accommodate sur- gery whenever possible, and appropriate aseptic surgi- cal procedures should be used. Good surgical practice includes the use of surgical caps, masks, gowns, and sterile gloves, as well as aseptic surgical site prepara- tion and draping. Sterile instruments must be used. Manufacturers' recommendations must be followed for chemical sterilants. For non-survival surgeries, during which the animal is euthanized before recovery from anesthesia, it may not be necessary to follow all aseptic techniques, but the instruments and surrounding area should be clean. Minor surgical procedures that do not penetrate a body cavity or produce substantial impairment (e.g., wound suturing, peripheral-vessel cannulation, certain standard agricultural practices) may be performed un- der less stringent conditions in accordance with stan- dard agricultural practices (Brown et al., 1993). Therapeutic and emergency surgeries (e.g., caesarean section, treatment of bloat, repair of displaced aboma- sum) may sometimes need to be performed in agricul- tural settings that are not conducive to rigid asepsis. However, every effort should be made to conduct such surgeries in a sanitary or aseptic manner and to use an- esthetics or analgesics commensurate with the risks to the animal's well-being. Research protocols that carry a high likelihood of the need for emergency surgery should contain provisions for handling anticipated cas- es. Surgical packs and equipment for such events should be prepared and readily available for emergency use. Postsurgical Care Appropriate facilities should be available for animals that are recovering from general anesthesia and major surgery. The following are recommended: Segregation from other animals until recovery from anesthesia; Clean and sanitary recovery area; Adequate space, with consideration for physical comfort and well-being of the animal, in a place suitable for recovery from anesthesia without in- jury (e.g., a room or stall with protective covering on floors and walls); Environmental controls sufficient to ensure main- tenance of environmental temperature within the thermoneutral zone and animal temperature with-12 CHAPTER 2: AGRICULTURAL ANIMAL HEALTH CARE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020in the normal range during postsurgical recovery; and Trained personnel for postsurgical observation to help ensure a safe recovery. Postsurgical observa- tion should be provided until the animal is fully recovered from anesthesia, ambulatory, and able to return safely to its original housing location. Signs of Pain and Distress Pain is an aversive feeling or sensation associated with actual or potential tissue damage resulting in physiological, neuroendocrine, and behavioral changes that indicate animal distress. Although pain and dis- tress in animals can often be detected by an experi- enced observer, these conditions are sometimes unap- parent, especially in stoic animals. When unanticipated pain or distress are detected, animal-care attendants or research staff should take immediate ameliorative ac- tion as necessary and contact the program veterinarian. Pain can be one of the earliest signs of disease or in- jury. Animals in pain may become less active, restless, reduce feed consumption, grind their teeth, vocalize, or appear frightened and agitated. Animals in pain may resist handling or favor the painful area by adopting an abnormal stance or abnormal behavior. In some cases, pain may not be noticed until a physi- ological act is induced, such as swallowing, coughing, chewing, or defecating. The observer should try to de- termine whether pain appears to be constant or associ- ated with a provoking act. Sudden, severe pain is often associated with fractures, rupture or torsion of visceral organs, or acute inflammation, and should be consid- ered an emergency. Practices that minimize pain or distress in agricul- tural animals can be summarized using the 3S ap- proach\u2014suppress, substitute, and soothe (Guatteo et al., 2012). This involves removing or correcting the in- citing cause of the pain (suppress), finding a less painful alternative (substitute), or administering appropriate analgesics, and other corrective steps (e.g., immobiliz- ing a fracture, elevating an injured claw by securing a wood block under the opposite claw) to relieve the pain (soothe). Relief of pain should be one of the first tasks of the program veterinarian, adhering to the following principles: (1) relief of pain is a humane act; (2) relief of pain must be initiated promptly once it is deemed nec- essary; and (3) it may be necessary to protect animals in pain from self-injury. The program veterinarian must be familiar with an- algesics labeled for use in specific agricultural animals and must be able to prescribe and establish withdrawal times for extra-label use of analgesics when indicated. Animals with severe or chronic pain that cannot be re- duced or alleviated may need to be euthanized. When experimental outcomes involve pain or distress that cannot be alleviated, humane endpoints must be clearly defined in the approved IACUC protocol.ZOONOSES Zoonotic diseases are defined as infectious diseases in animals that can be transmitted to humans, who, in turn, may transmit the infectious agent to another ani- mal. Information pertaining to zoonotic diseases can be found online in the Merck Veterinary Manual (https:// www.merckvetmanual.com/). A current list and inci- such as Q-fever (Coxiella burnetii ), may be obtained from the US Centers for Dis- ease Control and Prevention (http://www.cdc.gov/). The program veterinarian, working in collaboration with scientists or instructors of record, should estab- lish appropriate preventive medicine programs and hus- bandry practices to decrease the likelihood of transmis- sion of potential zoonotic agents. Each institution must have an appropriate occupational health and safety program for evaluating human health risks associated with animal contact and must take steps to ensure that health risks for each individual are assessed and man- aged at an acceptable level. RESIDUE AVOIDANCE Administration of drugs to animals destined to en- ter the food chain requires special consideration. Before an animal may be slaughtered for human or animal food purposes, time must be allowed for medications, drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or substances allowed by the FDA for experi- mental testing under the Investigational New Animal Drug (INAD) exemption to be depleted from the tis- sues. Such use is only permitted when it adheres to regulations in the Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarifi- cation Act of 1994, Public Law 103-396 (US Food and Drug Administration, 1994). A record of the product used, dose, route of administration, duration of treat- ment, and period of withdrawal must be maintained. Adherence to proper withdrawal times must be ensured before animals are transported to the auction, market, or abattoir. Residues of 3 groups of chemicals must be prevented from occurring in research animals if these animals or their products are to enter the human food chain. These are (1) approved drugs used according to directions on the label, (2) drugs used in an extra-label fashion, and (3) other chemicals such as herbicides, pesticides, and wood preservatives. The Food Animal Residue Avoid- ance Database (FARAD; http://www.farad.org/) is a project sponsored by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). The FARAD Com - pendium of FDA Approved Drugs provides information about drugs that are available for treating animal dis- eases, the withholding times for milk and eggs, and pre-slaughter withdrawal times for meat. Information about the drugs approved for use in food animals in the United States is included in this online database (http://www.farad.org/). The FARAD compendium al-13 CHAPTER 2: AGRICULTURAL ANIMAL HEALTH CARE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020lows selection of over-the-counter products that satisfy particular needs as well as alerts to the need for veteri- nary assistance with prescription drugs; FARAD also provides estimates of meat and milk withdrawal times for extra-label use of drugs. Drug Storage and Control Pharmaceuticals intended for use in food-producing animals must be managed responsibly. Storage should be in an area that is clean and dry and that offers protection from changes in temperature, sunlight, dust, moisture, and vermin. The manufacturer's labeling should be consulted for specific information regarding appropriate storage conditions and product shelf life. In addition, the integrity of product containers should be periodically evaluated to assess for potential leakage or contamination of the stored product. Products in damaged containers or with missing or illegible labels should be disposed of properly. In addition to dating the first use of the product, and to minimize the potential for treatment errors, prod- ucts should be physically segregated according to indi- cated use. For example, this could involve segregation of drugs by category when intended only for animals of a certain age or production state (e.g., lactating, non- lactating, pregnant, or neonatal). For large inventories, separate storage cabinets for each group of products will further reduce the chance of errors in selection and use. Lockable storage units can be used to prevent ac- cess by unauthorized persons. Record-Keeping Records of all potentially harmful products used in the facility, their storage, their use, and their disposal should be maintained. If used in accord with the label and with allowance for the correct withdrawal time, approved drugs should not result in violative residues. Record-keeping and management should confirm that drugs are not outdated and that the directions on the label have been followed. Records should be maintained for at least 2 years or in timelines consistent with state and federal requirements as they apply (21CFR530; https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/ cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=530). In the event that animals are given an investigational drug, no meat, eggs, or milk from those animals may be processed for human consumption unless authorization has been granted by the FDA or the US Department of Agriculture and an appropriate INAD exemption from the FDA has been obtained for use of the investiga- tional drug. In such cases, the investigator must follow specifications outlined in the INAD. The authorization to process meat, eggs, or milk from such animals will depend on the development of data to show that the consumption of animal products so treated is consistent with public health considerations and that the product does not contain the residues of harmful drugs or their metabolites. Proper methods of disposal of such meat, eggs, and milk may include incineration, burial, or oth- er procedures ensuring safety, sanitation, and avoidance of the human food supply. Extra-Label Use The use of different dosages, formulations, or routes of administration or the treatment of animals for con- ditions not specifically mentioned on the product label constitutes extra-label drug use (ELDU). Such use may be considered by licensed veterinarians when the health of the animal is immediately threatened and when suf- fering or death would result from failure to treat the affected animal. Such use is only permitted when it adheres to the regulations promulgated by the FDA under the Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act (AMDUCA) of 1994, Public Law 103-396 (US Food and Drug Administration, 1994). The major principles guiding such use are that (1) there must be a valid veterinarian-client-patient relationship (VCPR); (2) ELDU in feed is illegal; (3) the compound intended for ELDU must be manufactured in an FDA-inspected facility; (4) records of ELDU must be maintained for 2 years; and (5) there must be an adequate safety margin in the withdrawal time based on the most complete pharmacokinetic data available. The FARAD data- base or FDA should be contacted whenever guidance is needed. All personnel attending to food animals should be aware that the marketing status of medically im- portant antimicrobials for use in feed or water for food animals changed from over-the-counter (OTC) to pre- scription (Rx) or to veterinary feed directive (VFD) at the end of calendar year 2016. Organic Farming Some institutions have organic farming components. The USDA National Organic Program standards [7CFR205.238 (c7); https://www.ams.usda.gov/rules- regulations/organic] state that the \"producer of an or- ganic livestock operation must not withhold medical treatment from a sick animal in an effort to preserve its organic status. All appropriate medications must be used to restore an animal to health when methods ac- ceptable to organic production fail.\" Sick animals must be treated using \"all appropriate medications\" regard- less of their intended \"organic\" status. Hazardous Chemicals Many chemicals used on farms and in agricultural research establishments could potentially result in resi- dues in the meat, milk, or eggs of animals exposed to these chemicals. Examples are pesticides for insect con- trol, herbicides, poisons for rodent control, wood pre- servatives, and disinfectants. Harmful products should 14 CHAPTER 2: AGRICULTURAL ANIMAL HEALTH CARE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020be properly labeled and stored, and expiration dates should be kept. Personnel must be informed of all such potential hazards and be required to wear appropriate protective equipment. Chemicals must be stored, used, and disposed of in a manner that prevents contamina- tion of animals and residues in milk, meat, or eggs. RESTRAINT Physical restraint of agricultural animals involves the use of manual or mechanical means to restrict an animal's movements for the purpose of examination, collection of samples, administration of drugs, or a variety of other experimental and clinical manipula- tions. The period of restraint should be the minimum required to accomplish the objective. Physical restraint can be accomplished with devices such as stocks, head gates, stanchions, halters, squeeze chutes, or snares with swine. Species-specific methods of restraint should always be used. It is important that such devices be suitable in size and design for the animal being held and be operated properly to minimize stress and avoid pain and injury (Grandin, 1983a,b). Refer to Chapter 5: Animal Handling and Transport for additional in- formation. Personnel should be trained on the use of hydraulically operated restraint devices to prevent po- tential injury. Prolonged physical restraint involves the restriction of normal animal movements for an extended period, typically hours or days. Animals should be conditioned to restraint equipment by a gradual process such as increasing the time of restraint on each occasion. Ex- tended physical restraint, including a description of the conditioning regimen and monitoring of the restraint, should be reviewed and approved by the IACUC. Less restrictive systems that do not limit an animal's ability to make normal postural adjustments should be used when compatible with protocol objectives (Morrison et al., 1996). HUMANE ENDPOINTS Euthanasia Euthanasia is a method of killing that minimizes pain, distress, and anxiety experienced by the animal before loss of consciousness. Protocols for euthanasia should follow the specifications for \"acceptable\" or \"ac- ceptable with conditions\" techniques as described in the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals (AVMA, 2020) and include the method for confirming that death has occurred. Copies of these protocols should be made available to all personnel who euthanize animals. The current edition of the AVMA guidelines should be con- sidered the primary standard for euthanasia. Euthanasia must be carried out only by trained per- sonnel in accordance with applicable regulations and policies. Where possible, the method used should not interfere with postmortem evaluations. Proper eutha- nasia includes skilled personnel who ensure that the technique is performed humanely and effectively and that the risk of injury to personnel is minimized or averted. Personnel who perform euthanasia must have training and experience with the techniques to be used. This training must include familiarity with the normal behavior of agricultural animals and how handling and restraint affect that behavior. All equipment and mate- rials required to perform euthanasia should be readily available, and the program veterinarian familiar with agricultural animals or a qualified scientist or techni- cian should ensure that all personnel performing eutha- nasia have demonstrated proficiency in the use of the techniques selected. No matter what method of euthanasia is performed, personnel must ensure that death has occurred. Assur- ance of death is most reliably confirmed with a com- bination of criteria including lack of pulse, breathing, corneal reflex, and response to firm toe pinch; inability to hear respiratory sounds and heartbeat by use of a stethoscope; graying of the mucous membranes; and rigor mortis. Slaughter Protocols for slaughter should follow the AVMA Guidelines for the Humane Slaughter of Animals (AVMA, 2016). These guidelines outline procedures for the hu- mane treatment of livestock before and during slaughter. Holding and processing areas must be designed and managed to minimize distress. In accordance with the US Code of Federal Regulations [9CFR\u00a7313.2(e)], wa- ter is to be accessible to livestock at all times in hold- ing pens, and feed is to be accessible after livestock have been held longer than 24 h. Stunning equipment must be properly maintained, and personnel must be properly trained, including instruction in assessing in- sensibility. In the United States, all procedures used to slaughter research and teaching animals that will enter the food chain must comply with US Code of Federal Regulations, Title 7, Chapter 48, Humane Slaughter of Livestock (USDA-FSIS, 2011). The USDA's Food Safe- ty and Inspection Service (FSIS) is the agency respon- sible for ensuring compliance with the Human Slaugh- ter Act. The North American Meat Institute (NAMI) has embraced guidelines (https://animalhandling.org/ producers/guidelines_audits) that exceed the NAMI guide- 2019) are incorporated here by reference. Depopulation Depopulation refers to the rapid destruction of a population of animals in response to urgent circum- stances with as much consideration given to the welfare of the animals as appropriate. Urgent circumstances 15 CHAPTER 2: AGRICULTURAL ANIMAL HEALTH CARE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020may include emergency situations, such as the need for immediate disease control or a response to natural or human-made disasters. Protocols for depopulation should follow the AVMA Guidelines for the Depopula- tion of Animals (AVMA, 2019). As much attention as possible should be shown to the needs and natures of animals that will be terminated (AVMA, 2019). How- ever, ensuring the welfare of animals is just one of many important considerations during an actual response to an emergency situation. Therefore, the emergency de- struction of animals through depopulation techniques may not guarantee that the deaths of the animals are as painless and distress-free as would be expected under other circumstances (AVMA, 2019).

Sound animal husbandry provides systems of care that permit animals to grow, mature, reproduce, and be healthy. Specific operating proce- dures depend on many factors that may be unique to individual institutions. Well-trained and properly mo- tivated personnel can often achieve high-quality animal care with less than ideal physical plants and equipment. FACILITIES AND ENVIRONMENT Agricultural animals may be kept in extensive envi- ronments (e.g., pasture or range) where they reside in large areas (e.g., acres or square miles) outdoors. They may also be kept in intensive environments (e.g., in houses, pens, or cages) where they are confined to an area and provided food, water, and appropriate shel- ter. Individual animals may be moved during their lives from extensive to intensive systems or vice versa. Macroenvironment and Microenvironment Animal well-being is a function of many environ- mental variables, including physical surroundings, nu- tritional intake, and social and biological interactions (Hafez, 1968; Curtis, 1983; Yousef, 1985a). Environ- mental conditions for animals need to be managed such that stress, illness, mortality, injury, and behavioral problems are minimized. Particular components of the environment that need to be taken into account include temperature, humidity, light, air quality, space (includ- ing complexity of space), social interactions, microbe concentrations, noise, vermin and predators, nutrition- al factors, and water. Physical conditions in the room, house, barn, or out- side environment constitute the macroenvironment; the microenvironment includes the immediate physical and biological surroundings. Different microenvironments may exist within the same macroenvironment. Both the microenvironment and macroenvironment should be appropriate for the genetic background and age of the animals and the purpose for which they are being used. Domestic animals readily adapt to a wide range of environments, but some genetic strains have specific needs, of which the scientist should be aware and for which accommodation should be made. Even in relatively moderate climatic regions, weather events such as floods, winter storms, and summer heat- waves may require that animals have access to shelter. If trees or geographic features do not provide enough protection, it is recommended that artificial shelters, windbreaks, or sunshades be provided (Mitl\u00f6hner et al., 2001, 2002; Johnson et al., 2008; Marcillac-Embertson et al., 2009; Sossidou et al., 2011; Fanatico et al., 2016). Other methods of combating heat stress are direct wet- ting of the animals, evaporative cooling of the air, and providing fans. Intervention strategies should be based on individual animal responses. For example, open- mouth panting and drooling are clear signs that cattle are experiencing heat stress. Cattle showing these signs have higher respiration rates and body temperatures than animals that are not heat stressed (Gaughan and Mader, 2014; Tresoldi et al., 2016). Animals affected by hyperthermia or hypothermia should be treated ac- cordingly. Genetic Differences Some strains of agricultural animals may have re- quirements that differ substantially from those of other stocks of the same species (Gross et al., 1984). Some strains of pigs, for example, are particularly suscep- tible to stress because they may more frequently carry an allele that causes malignant hyperthermia when the animal experiences even mild stress (B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m and Kauffman, 1995). Transgenic animals may have special needs for husbandry and care (Mench, 1998); see Chap- ter 1: Institutional Policies. Animal care practices for a special strain should address the needs of the strain itself. Space Requirements Floor area is only one of the components that deter- mine the space requirements of an animal. Enclosure shape, floor type, ceiling height, location and dimen-CHAPTER 3: HUSBANDRY , HOUSING, AND BIOSECURITY 17sions of feeders and waterers, features inside the enclo- sure, and other physical and social elements also affect the amount of space sensed, perceived, and used by animals in intensive management systems (Strickland and Gonyou, 1995; Leone and Estevez, 2008). Determination of area requirements for domestic animals need to consider body size, head height, stage of life cycle, behavior, health, and weather conditions. Unless experimental or welfare considerations dictate otherwise, space should be sufficient for normal pos- tural adjustments, including standing, lying, resting, self-grooming, eating, drinking, and eliminating feces and urine. When animals are crowded, body weight gain and other performance traits may be depressed (Adams and Craig, 1985; Young et al., 2008; Guardia et al., 2011; Callahan et al., 2017), and animals may show altered levels of aggressive behavior (Al-Rawi and Craig, 1975; Winckler et al., 2015). Temperature and Water Vapor Pressure Air temperature, water vapor pressure, and air veloc- ity are some of the most important factors in the physi- cal environment of agricultural animals. In addition, factors related to animal health and genetics affect the thermal balance of animals and thus their behavior, me- tabolism, and performance. The range of environmen- tal temperatures over which animals use the minimum amount of metabolizable dietary energy to control body temperature is termed the \"thermo neutral needed within this zone. Tem- perature and vapor pressure ranges vary widely among geographic locations. The long-term welfare of an ani- mal is not necessarily compromised each time it experi- ences cold or heat stress. However, the overall efficiency of metabolizable energy use for productive purposes is generally lower outside the thermoneutral zone than it is within the zone. The thermal environment that animals actually ex- perience (i.e., effective environmental temperature) represents the combined effects of several variables, including air temperature, vapor pressure, air speed, surrounding surface temperatures, insulative effects of the surroundings, and the age, sex, weight, infectious status, transgenic modification status, adaptation sta- tus, activity level, posture, stage of production, body condition, and dietary regimen of the animal. To overcome the shortcomings of using ambient tem- perature as the only indicator of animal comfort, ther- mal indices have been developed to better characterize the influence of multiple environmental variables on the animal. The temperature-humidity index (THI), first proposed by Thom (1959), has been extensively ap- plied for moderate to hot conditions, even with recog- nized limitations related to airspeed and radiation heat loads (NOAA, 1976). At the present time, the THI has become the de facto standard for classifying thermal environments in many animal studies and selection of management practices during seasons other than win- ter (Hahn et al., 2003). The THI or heat stress index (HSI) describes catego- ries of heat stress associated with different combina- tions of temperature and relative humidity for livestock and poultry exposed to extreme conditions. Categories requiring management actions are \"alert,\" \"danger,\" and \"emergency\" (Xin and Harmon, 1998). Because different animal species have different sensitivities to temperature and relative humidity, conditions that con- stitute heat stress vary among species. The THI has also been developed and used for laying hens (Zulovich and DeShazer, 1990), hen turkeys (Xin et al., 1992), and tom turkeys (Brown-Brandl et al., 1997). Xin and Harmon (1998) described HSI for swine, cattle, laying hens, and turkey hens. For example, lactating dairy cattle may experience heat stress at a THI of 68 (Zim- belman et al., 2009). In addition, Tao and Xin (2003) developed a temperature-humidity-air velocity index (THVI) for broilers. Temperature-humidity indices for today's poultry have been modified due to changes in poultry genetics and current environmental conditions. Ventilation and Air Quality Appropriate ventilation of indoor barns is essential in providing acceptable air quality to both humans and animals. A ventilation system removes heat, wa- ter vapor, and air pollutants from an enclosed animal facility (i.e., a facility in which air enters and leaves only through openings that are designed expressly for those purposes) at the same time that it introduces fresh air. Adequate ventilation is a major consideration in prevention of respiratory and other diseases. Where temperature control is critical, cooling or heating may be required to supplement the ventilation system. For certain research projects, filtration or air conditioning may be needed as well. Typically, ventilation is the primary means of main- taining the desired air temperature and water vapor pressure conditions in the animal microenvironment. The amount of ventilation needed depends on the size, number, type, age, and dietary regimen of the animals, the waste management system, and atmospheric condi- tions. Equipment and husbandry practices that affect heat and water vapor loads inside the animal house should be considered in the design and operation of the ventilation system. Ventilation rates in enclosed facilities (MWPS, 1989, 1990a,b) should increase from a cold-season minimum (to remove water vapor, contaminants, and odors as well as modify inside temperature) to a hot-season maximum (usually around 10 times the minimum rate, to limit the increase in temperature inside the house that is due to the solar radiation load and sensible ani- mal heat). Because the animals themselves are the ma- jor source of water vapor, heat, and (indirectly) odor 18 CHAPTER 3: HUSBANDRY, HOUSING, AND BIOSECURITY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020ous matter, ventilation rate calculated on the basis of animal mass is more accurate than that based on air exchange rate guidelines. The goal of hot-weather ventilation is to remove heat, whereas during cold weather, the goal is to remove moisture. Relative humidity is ordinarily the metric used to describe the air moisture content. Hot-weather ventilation rates should be sufficiently high to maintain the relative humidity below 80% in an enclosed animal house (Curtis, 1983; Hinkle and Strombaugh, 1983), ex- cept in situations in which high relative humidity does not cause animal health concerns. Conversely, venti- lation rate during cold weather should be sufficiently low to ensure that the relative humidity does not fall to a level that causes animal health concerns, unless needs for air quality or condensation control necessitate a higher rate. Atmospheric humidity does not ordinar- ily become a significant factor in determining effective environmental temperature until the air temperature approaches the temperature of the animal's surface, in which case the animal will depend almost entirely on evaporative heat loss to maintain thermal equilibrium with the environment. The use of fans to promote air movement can be ben- eficial during hot weather if there is too little natural air movement. Direct wetting is effective in decreasing heat stress on cattle, pigs, and poultry; however, it can cause death in poultry if inappropriately applied. Wet- ting is best accomplished by water sprinkled or dripped directly on the animals. Misters and evaporative cool- ers specifically designed to reduce air dry-bulb temper- ature are also used to reduce heat stress on agricultural animals. Animals with outdoor access can be protected from heat stress by correctly designing and maintaining sunshades to reduce solar radiation load. Trees, if avail- able, are excellent sunshades. Artificial, roofed shades are acceptable as well. Mechanical ventilation requires proper design and operation of both air inlets and fans for proper dis- tribution and mixing of the air and thus for creating uniform conditions throughout the animal living space. Mechanical ventilation, with fans creating static pres- sure differences between inside and outside the house, brings in fresh air and exhausts air that has picked up heat, water vapor, and air pollutants while passing through the building. Mechanical ventilation, if prop- erly designed, provides better control of air exchange for enclosed, insulated animal houses in colder climates than does natural ventilation. The effectiveness of natu- ral ventilation in cold climates will depend on the de- sign and orientation of the enclosure, as well as the species and number of animals housed and the stage of their life cycle. Natural ventilation uses thermal buoyancy and wind currents to vent air through openings in outside walls or at the ridge of the building. Natural ventilation is especially effective for cold animal houses (i.e., houses in which no heat is supplied in addition to animal heat) in moderate climates; however, insulated walls, ceilings, and floors are often recommended to minimize conden- sation. The air exchange rate needed to remove the water vapor generated by animals and evaporation of water from environmental surfaces often brings air tem- perature inside such houses down to values near those outdoors. If waterers and water pipes are protected from freezing, the practical low operating temperature is the point at which manure freezes, although this tem- perature would be too cold for some species or stages of the life cycle. Automatic curtains or vent panels, insulated ceilings, and circulating fans help to regulate and enhance natural ventilation systems. During cold weather, ventilation in houses for neo- natal animals should maintain acceptable air quality in terms of water vapor and other pollutants without chilling the animals. Air speed should be less than 0.25 m/s (50 ft/min) past very young animals. Cold drafts on young poultry or pigs should be avoided (Curtis, 1983). In enclosed animal houses, both environmental tem- perature and air quality depend on the continuous func- tioning of the ventilation system. It is recommended that an automatic warning system be installed alerting animal care and security personnel to power failures and out-of-tolerance environmental conditions, and an onsite generator should be available for emergency use. The relative air pressures between animal areas and service areas of a building should be considered when the ventilation system is designed to minimize the in- troduction of airborne disease agents or air pollutants into the service area. Advice of a qualified agricultural engineer or other specialist should be sought for the design of and operating recommendations for ventila- tion equipment. Air quality refers to the nature of the air with respect to its effects on the health and well-being of animals and the humans who work with them. Air quality is typically defined in terms of the air content of certain gases, particulates, and liquid aerosols, including those carrying microbes of various sorts. Good ventilation, waste management, and husband- ry usually result in acceptable air quality. Ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, carbon monoxide, and methane are the pollutant gases of most concern in animal facilities (Curtis, 1986). In addition, OSHA (2017) has estab- lished allowable exposure levels for human workers hav- ing 8 h of exposure daily to these gases. The concentra- tion of ammonia to which animals are exposed ideally would be less than 10 ppm and should not exceed 25 ppm, but a temporary excess may not adversely affect animal health (Von Borell et al., 2007). Comparable concentrations for hydrogen sulfide are 10 and 50 ppm, respectively. The concentration of carbon monoxide (arising from unvented heaters) in air breathed by ani- mals should not exceed 150 ppm (OSHA, 2002), and methane should not exceed 50,000 ppm. Special ven- tilation is required when waste pits beneath the floor are emptied because of the potentially lethal hazards to animals and humans from the hydrogen sulfide and 19 CHAPTER 3: HUSBANDRY, HOUSING, AND BIOSECURITY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020methane gases that are released. The allowable dust levels specified by OSHA (2017) are based on expo- sure of human workers for 8 h daily without facemasks; allowable dust levels are 5 mg/m3 for respirable dust (particle size of 5 m or less) and 15 mg/m3 for total dust. Although animals can tolerate higher levels of in- ert dust with no discernible detriment to their health or welfare (Curtis and Drummond, 1982), the concentra- tion of dust in animal house air should be minimized. Many factors affect airborne dust concentration, in- cluding relative humidity, animal activity, air velocity, and type of feed. Dust concentration is lower at higher relative humidity. High animal activity and air veloci- ties stir up more particles and keep them suspended longer. Fat or oil added to feed reduces dust generation (Chiba et al., 1985). Microbes and pollutant gases may attach to airborne dust particles (Zhao et al., 2016). Concentrations of microbes in the air should be mini- mized. Dust and vapor pressure need to be controlled. Proper ventilation should preclude the mixing of air from microenvironments in which infected animals are housed with that from the microenvironments of unin- fected animals. Lighting Illumination should be sufficient to aid in maintain- ing good husbandry practices and to allow adequate inspection of animals, the welfare of the animals, and safe working conditions for personnel. Although successful light management schemes are used routinely in various animal industries to support reproductive and productive performance, precise light- ing requirements for the maintenance of good health and physiological stability are not known for most ani- mals. However, animals should be provided with both light and dark periods during a 24-h cycle unless the research protocol requires otherwise. Long-day lighting schemes during lactation and short-day schemes during the dry period enhance lactation performance by dairy cattle (Dahl et al., 2000). See Chapters 6 through 13 for references on lighting and photoperiod in individual species. Provision of variable-intensity controls and regular maintenance of light fixtures helps to ensure light in- tensities that are consistent with energy conservation and the needs of animals (as they are understood), as well as providing adequate illumination for personnel working in animal rooms. A time-controlled lighting system may be desirable or necessary to provide a di- urnal lighting cycle. Timers need to be checked periodi- cally to ensure their proper operation. Excreta Management and Sanitation A complete excreta management system is necessary for any intensive animal facility. The goals of this sys- tem are as follows: to maintain acceptable levels of worker health and animal health and production through clean facili- ties; to prevent pollution of water, soil, and air; to minimize generation of odors and dust; to minimize vermin and parasites; to meet sanitary inspection requirements; and to comply with local, state, and federal laws, regu- lations, and policies. The planning and design of livestock excreta manage- ment facilities and equipment are discussed in MWPS (1993, 2001, 2002). Proper management of excreta should ensure that the animals are kept reasonably dry and clean. A quick assessment of animal cleanliness can provide insight into the quality of their housing environment (cleanli- ness and dryness). Good sanitation is essential in in- tensive animal facilities, and principles of good sanita- tion must be understood by animal care personnel and professional staff. Animals can harbor microbes that are pathogenic to humans and other species. Different levels of sanitation may be appropriate under different circumstances, depending on whether manure packs, pits, outdoor mounds, dirt floors, or other types of ex- creta management and housing systems are being used. Waste containers should be emptied and implements cleaned frequently. It is good practice to use dispos- able liners and to wash containers regularly. In some instances, animals may be intentionally exposed to ex- creta to enhance immunity. A written plan should be developed and implemented for the sanitation of each facility housing agricultural animals. Building interiors, corridors, storage spaces, anterooms, and other areas should be cleaned regularly and sanitized appropriately. At the conclusion of the animal project, organic de- bris should be removed from equipment and from floor, wall, and ceiling surfaces for cleaning. At times, com- plete removal of bedding material and organic debris may not occur as a result of the production system; for example, in broiler and turkey houses. In this case, composting or litter windrowing is a recommended ap- proach to treat the material before the next group of animals is placed into the production environment. If sanitation depends on heat for effectiveness, the clean- ing equipment must be able to supply water that is at least 82\u00b0C (180\u00b0F). When chemical disinfection is used, the temperature of the wash water may be cooler. If no machine is available, surfaces and equipment may be washed by hand with appropriate detergents and disinfectants and using vigorous scrubbing. Health and performance of animals can be affected by the time interval between successive occupations of intensive facilities. Complete disinfection of such quar- ters during the unoccupied phase of an all-in, all-out regimen of facility management is effective for disease management in some situations. Programs of pasture-to-crop rotation for periodically resting the pasture and programs that permit grazing 20 CHAPTER 3: HUSBANDRY, HOUSING, AND BIOSECURITY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020by other animal species can aid in the control of soil- borne diseases and parasites. Spreading of manure on pastures as fertilizer is a sound and acceptable manage- ment practice but may spread toxic agents and infec- tious pathogens (Wray and Sojka, 1977). Other meth- ods of waste disposal may be required for manure of animals infected with known pathogens. Animal health programs should stipulate storage, handling, and use criteria for chemicals designed to in- activate infectious microbes and parasites. An animal health program should include information on preven- tion, immunization, treatment, and testing procedures for specific infectious diseases endemic in the region. Where serious pathogens have been identified, the immediate environment may need to be disinfected as part of a preventive program. Elimination of moist and muddy areas in pastures may not be possible, but pro- longed destocking is an available option. Dry-lot fa- cilities may need to be scraped and refilled with un- contaminated materials. Thorough cleaning of animal housing facilities may be followed by disinfection. Selec- tion of disinfection agents should be based on knowl- edge of potential pathogens and their susceptibilities to the respective agents (Meyerholz and Gaskin, 1981a,b). Some means of sterilizing equipment and supplies (e.g., an autoclave or gas sterilizer) is essential when certain pathogenic microbes are present and for some specialized facilities and animal colonies. Except in special cases (e.g., specific-pathogen-free animals), rou- tine sterilization of equipment, feed, and bedding is not necessary if clean materials from reliable sources are used. In areas where hazardous biological, chemical, or physical agents are being used, a system for monitoring equipment should be implemented. FEED AND WATER Animals must be provided with feed and water in a consistent manner, on a regular schedule, in accor- dance with the requirements established for each spe- cies by the NRC (1994, 2001, 2007a,b, 2012, 2016) and as recommended for the geographic area. Nutrient lev- els below NRC requirement listings may be necessary for proper evaluation in studies evaluating nutrient requirements or comparing the relative feed value of different diet and/or ration components. When excep- tions are required by an experimental or instructional protocol, these must be justified in the protocol and require approval by the institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC). Feeders and waterers must be designed and situated to allow easy access without undue competition (NRAES, 1990; Lacy, 1995; Pirkel- mann, 1995; Taylor, 1995; Smith et al., 2004). Sufficient water must be available to meet the ani- mals' daily needs under all environmental conditions. Water troughs, bowls, or other delivery devices must be cleaned as needed to ensure adequate intake and to decrease transmission of microbial- or contaminant-as-sociated disease. It is recommended that non-municipal water sources be periodically tested for quality by an approved agency or laboratory. Large supplies of feed should be stored in appropri- ate, designated areas (MWPS, 2017). Bulk feed storage containers and feed barrels should be well maintained to minimize entry of pests, water contamination, and microbial growth. It is recommended that containers and the area around them such as the auger boot area be cleaned regularly to ensure feed quality. Feed in sacks must be stored off the floor and away from the walls on pallets or racks, and each sack must be labeled, as recommended by the Association of American Feed Control Officials, with the contents and manufacture date (AAFCO, 2019). All feedstuffs should be main- tained in such a manner as to prevent contamination by chemicals or pests. For example, open feed sacks should be stored in closed containers, and mixing devices and utensils, feed delivery equipment, and feeders/feeding sites should be cleaned regularly to ensure adequate feed intake and decrease transmission of microbial- or contaminant-associated disease. Feed placed in carts or in other delivery devices needs to be fed promptly or covered to avoid attracting pests. An effective program of vermin control should be instituted in feed storage areas. Animal care personnel should routinely inspect feed to identify gross abnormalities such as mold, for- eign bodies, or feces; such feed must not be fed until the abnormal components are removed or the feed is deter- mined to be safe. Toxic compounds (Osweiler, 1985) should be stored in a designated area away from feed and animals to avoid accidental consumption. SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT Agricultural animals are social by nature and social isolation is a stressor (Gross and Siegel, 1981; Marsden and Wood-Gush, 1986). A poor social environment has been linked to illness in farm animals such as cattle, swine, and chickens (Proudfoot et al., 2012). Consider- ations involved in implementing social housing for agri- cultural animals are discussed by Mench et al. (1992). If social housing is not feasible because of experimen- tal protocols or because of unpreventable injurious ag- gression among group members, singly housed animals should be provided with some degree of visual, audi- tory, or olfactory contact with other members of their species. Socialization to humans and regular positive human contact can also be beneficial (Gross and Siegel, 1982; Hemsworth et al., 1986, 1993). In some instances, one species can be used as a companion for another species (e.g., goats and horses; Gross and Siegel, 1982; Hemsworth et al., 1986, 1993). Temporary isolation is sometimes required for an animal's safety (e.g., during recovery from surgery), but the animal should be re- turned to a social setting as soon as possible, with the understanding there may be aggression to the animal from the group. 21 CHAPTER 3: HUSBANDRY, HOUSING, AND BIOSECURITY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020Separation by Species Agricultural animals of different species are typi- cally kept in different enclosures to reduce interspecies conflict, meet the husbandry and environmental needs of the animals, and facilitate research and teaching. However, some research protocols or curricula require species to be co-housed. Facility design and husbandry practices influence whether this can be accomplished in a manner that assures the welfare of the animals. Mixing of compatible species (e.g., sheep and cattle) can often be accomplished more easily in extensive pro- duction situations than in intensive housing situations. Some species can carry subclinical or latent infections that can be transmitted to other species housed in close proximity, causing clinical disease or mortality. There- fore, a qualified veterinarian or scientist should recom- mend appropriate health and biosecurity practices if species are to be co-housed. Separation by Source Animals obtained from different sources often differ in microbiological status. It is usually desirable to keep these animals separated, at least until microbiologic status is determined (e.g., serologic testing, microbio- logic culture, fecal flotation) or steps (e.g., vaccination, deworming, treatment, culling) are taken to protect against disease transmission. A qualified veterinarian and animal facility manager should work together to devise housing configurations and husbandry practices that assure animal health and welfare while also meet- ing research or teaching goals. HUSBANDRY Animal Care Personnel The principal scientist or animal management su- pervisor must make all animal care personnel aware of their responsibilities during both normal work hours and emergencies. A program of special husbandry pro- cedures in case of an emergency should be developed. Personnel caring for agricultural animals used for re- search or teaching must be appropriately qualified or trained. Qualification by experience or training must be documented. Protocols for emergency care must be developed and made available to all personnel. Observation Animals in intensive accommodations should be ob- served and cared for daily by trained and experienced caretakers. Illumination must be adequate to facilitate inspection. In some circumstances, more frequent obser- vation or care may be needed (e.g., during parturition, postsurgical recovery, confinement in a metabolism stall, or recovery from illness). Under extensive condi-tions, such as range or pasture, observations should be frequent enough to detect illness or injury in a timely fashion, recognize the need for emergency action, and ensure adequate availability of feed and water. A di- saster plan must be developed for observing animals and providing care during emergency weather or health situations. Regardless of accommodations, animal ob- servations should be documented and husbandry or health concerns reported to the animal facility manager or attending veterinarian as appropriate. Emergency, Weekend, and Holiday Care There must be a means for rapid communication in case of an emergency. In emergencies, facility security and fire personnel must be able to contact staff mem- bers responsible for the care of agricultural animals. Names and contact information for those individuals should be posted prominently in the animal facility and updated regularly. The institution must ensure that emergency services can be contacted at any time by staff members. The institution must ensure continuity of daily ani- mal care, to encompass weekends, holidays, unexpected absences of assigned personnel, and emergency situa- tions. Staff assigned to weekends and holidays must be qualified to perform assigned duties. Cross-training of staff and establishment of standard operating proce- dures is encouraged to ensure consistent, high-quality care. Emergency veterinary care must be readily avail- able after daily work hours, on weekends, and on holi- days. In the event that weather conditions or natural di- sasters make feeding temporarily impossible, every at- tempt should be made to provide animals with a con- tinuous supply of water. Absence of feed for up to 48 h should not seriously endanger the health of normal, well-nourished juvenile or adult cattle, sheep, goats, horses, poultry, or swine. Feed should be provided within 24 h to very young animals that are not nursing their dams. Emergency Plans A site-specific emergency plan must be developed to care for agricultural animals that are used for research and teaching. The goal for the plan should be to provide proper management and care for the animals regardless of the conditions. However, some conditions may be so unusual and extreme that it will not be possible to provide immediate care for the animals and to simulta- neously ensure employee safety. Thus, emergency plans should define proper animal management and care and parameters to ensure employee safety. Emergency plans must name employees or positions that are considered essential for providing proper ani- mal management and care. Those employees should un- derstand that responding to emergencies is a condition 22 CHAPTER 3: HUSBANDRY, HOUSING, AND BIOSECURITY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020of employment and that they will be held accountable should they fail to care properly for the animals. Plans should focus on emergencies that are most likely to oc- cur in the specific geographic area or the research or teaching facility (e.g., heavy snow, blizzard, ice, high wind, tornado, hurricane, fire, flood, breach of physi- cal security that disrupts care, or breach of biosecurity that threatens the animals). Emergency plans should include animal evacuation plans specific to the research or teaching facility and actions to be taken if transpor- tation is interrupted. Animal Identification and Records Animals should be permanently identified by a meth- od that can be easily read. Identification of individ- ual animals is desirable but, in some circumstances, it is acceptable to identify animals by group, cage, or pen. Individual birds may be wing- or leg-banded, or wing- or neck-tagged with clothing tag fasteners. Ear notching, ear tattooing, ear tags, and electronic tran- sponders may be used for individual identification of other species, and each has its advantages and disad- vantages. Ear notches and tattoos are permanent and effective, but notching constitutes elective surgery and tattoos generally cannot be read without restraining animals. Electronic transponders require special sensor units or stations but should be considered when pos- sible. Cattle and horses should not be branded unless legally required. Cattle should be identified by methods that minimize pain; for example, ear tags or collars. Re- cently, biometric identification (e.g., nose prints, DNA profiling, iris scanning, and retinal scanning) has been investigated as a noninvasive tool that is less prone to fraud than the aforementioned alternatives (Awad, 2016). Any associated pain and distress should be con- sidered when determining the method of identification. In some cases, it may be necessary to identify animals in multiple ways (e.g., as a transgenic animal and by individual identification). Individual records are needed for many protocols that make use of animals. These records may include information about the animal (e.g., birth date, sex), its productivity, protocols the animal is assigned to, and ultimate disposition. Records for individual animals or groups may also include dates of vaccination, parasite control measures used, and blood testing dates and re- sults. Applicable veterinary data to be recorded include dates of examination/treatment, clinical information/ diagnosis, names of medications and amounts and routes of administration, descriptions of surgical procedures, and resolution of surgical procedures or illnesses. Prin- cipal scientists or animal facility managers may wish to record nutritional information. Research protocols often dictate that additional information be recorded. Refer to Chapters 6 to 13 for species-level information on species- specific identification and record keeping.Vermin Control Programs should be instituted to control infestation of animal facilities by vermin (e.g., flies, cockroaches, mosquitoes, lice, mites, ticks, grubs, rodents, skunks, and pest birds such as starlings, pigeons, and spar- rows). The FDA Egg Safety Rule outlines protocols for monitoring and controlling rodents and flies in egg fa- cilities that contain 3,000 hens or more (FDA, 2009). The most effective control in facilities prevents entry of vermin into the facility by screening openings and ceil- ings; sealing cracks; eliminating vermin breeding, roost- ing, and refuge sites; and limiting access of vermin to feed supplies and water sources. Pesticides should be used only as approved (Hodg- son, 1980). Particular caution should be exercised with respect to residues in feedstuffs, which could injure ani- mals and (or) eventually pass into the meat, milk, or eggs (Willett et al., 1981). A pesticide applicator or a commercial service may be used. In some regions, wildlife (e.g., skunks, raccoons, coy- otes, and foxes) and stray cats and dogs may spread zoonotic diseases, including rabies, to agricultural ani- mals. In high-risk locations, institutions should imple- ment an educational program that includes training scientific and animal care personnel to recognize the signs of rabies in both wildlife and agricultural species and how to safely handle and report potentially rabid animals. Vaccination may be advisable for humans who may come into contact with animals in regions where rabies is endemic. Although the use of free-roaming cats is a traditional form of pest control for agricultural facilities, cats limit the ability for baiting, present hygiene or accident risks, and serve as disease vectors (Van't Woudt, 1990; Van Sambeek et al., 1995; Vantassel et al., 2005). Therefore, it is suggested that cats not be included as a method of rodent control. STANDARD AGRICUL TURAL PRACTICES Sometimes procedures that result in temporary dis- tress and even some pain are necessary to sustain the long-term welfare of animals or their handlers. These practices include (but are not limited to) comb-, toe-, and beak-trimming of chickens; bill-trimming dehorning hoof-trimming, and tusk-cutting of swine; and castration of males and spaying of females in some species. Some of these procedures reduce injuries to humans and other animals (e.g., cannibalism, tail- biting, and goring). Castration, for example, reduces the chances of aggression against other animals. Bulls and boars cause many serious injuries to humans (Han- ford and Fletcher, 1983). Standard agricultural prac-23 CHAPTER 3: HUSBANDRY, HOUSING, AND BIOSECURITY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020tices for the different species are found in Chapter 2 and Chapters 6 through 13. Sick, Injured, and Dead Animals Sick and injured animals should be segregated from the main group when feasible, observed thoroughly at least once daily, and provided veterinary care as ap- propriate. Incurably ill or injured animals in chronic pain or distress should be euthanized (see Chapter 2: Agricultural Animal Health Care and Chapters 6 through 13 for species-specific recommendations) as soon as they are diagnosed as such. Dead animals are potential sources of infection. Their disposal should be accomplished promptly by a commercial rendering ser- vice or other appropriate means (e.g., burial, alkaline hydrolysis, composting, or incineration) and according to applicable ordinances and regulations. Postmortem examination of fresh or well-preserved animals may provide important animal health information and aid in preventing further losses. When warranted and fea- sible, waste and bedding that have been removed from facilities occupied by an animal that has died should be moved to an area that is inaccessible to other animals. More information regarding sick, injured, and dead animals is available in Chapter 2: Agricultural Animal Health Care. HANDLING AND TRANSPORT Additional details on the handling, restraint, and transportation of animals are given in Chapter 5: Ani- mal Handling and Transport. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS Noise Occupational noise limitations have been established for workers. Employees should be provided appropriate hearing protection and monitored for their effects when working in loud circumstances (Mitloehner and Calvo, 2008). Noise is an important husbandry consideration and is discussed further in the section on sensory en- richment in Chapter 4: Environmental Enrichment and on animal perception in Chapter 5: Animal Handling and Transport. Metabolism Stalls and Other Intensive Procedures Animals that are subjected to intensive procedures re- quiring prolonged restraint, frequent sampling, or other procedures experience less stress if they are trained to cooperate voluntarily with the procedure. Cattle, pigs, and other animals can be trained with food rewards to accept and cooperate with various procedures, such as jugular et al., 1995). Many studies of the nutrition and physiology of ag- ricultural animals use a specialized piece of equipment, the metabolism stall. Successful designs have been re- ported for various species (Mayo, 1961; Welch et al., 1964; Baker et al., 1967; Stillions and Nelson, 1968; Wooden et al., 1970). These stalls give animal research and care personnel easy access to the animal and its excreta. The degree of restraint of animals housed in metabo- lism stalls may be substantially different from that of other methods that restrict mobility (e.g., stanchions and tethering). Animals in metabolism stalls are often held by a head gate or neck tether and are restricted in their lateral and longitudinal mobility. These differenc- es may exacerbate the effects of restriction on animals housed in metabolism stalls (Bowers et al., 1993). Me- tabolism stalls should be used only for approved stud- ies, not for the purpose of routine housing. There should be a sufficient preconditioning period to ensure adequate adjustment and comfort of the ani- mal to the metabolism stall before sample collection starts. Animal-based measures (e.g., lying time) should be used to determine the animal's adjustment and com- fort. At least enough space should be provided in the metabolism stall for the animal to rise and lie down normally. When possible, metabolism stalls should be positioned so that the animal is in visual, auditory, and olfactory contact with conspecific animals to minimize the effects of social isolation. Thermal requirements of animals may be affected when they are placed in metabolism stalls. For exam- ple, the lower critical environmental temperature of an animal held individually in a metabolism stall is greater than when residing in a group because the single ani- mal cannot obtain the heat-conserving benefits of hud- dling with group-mates. Animals in metabolism stalls should be observed more frequently than those in other environments, and particular attention should be paid to changes in be- havior and appetite and the condition of skin, feet, and legs. Recommendations for particular species can be found in the appropriate chapters of this guide. BIOSECURITY The term \"biosecurity\" in an agricultural setting has historically been defined as the security measures taken to prevent the unintentional transfer of patho- genic organisms and subsequent infection of production animals by humans, vermin, or other means (i.e., bio- exclusion). Biosecurity is also applied in the same con- text to agricultural animals used in the field of agricul- tural research, teaching, and testing. With the advent of bioterrorism and the designation of select agents, \"bios- ecurity\" has acquired new definitions, depending on the field to which it is applied. Biosecurity is now used to 24 CHAPTER 3: HUSBANDRY, HOUSING, AND BIOSECURITY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020define national and local policies and procedures that address the protection of food and water supplies from intentional contamination and is additionally used to define measures required to maintain security and ac- countability of select agents and toxins. It is important to understand these concepts when using the term and to clarify that, in this section, we are using the term in the context of preventing the unintentional transfer of pathogens to animals and humans through appropriate facility design, training, and precautions (e.g., immuni- zations). The USDA has published voluntary guidelines and a checklist as a resource to help the agricultural producer reduce security risks at the farm level (USDA, 2006). The USDA publication is designed to prevent both intentional and unintentional introduction of pathogens at the farm level. Additionally, a list of ref- erences and resources is provided in the publication on a variety of farm biosecurity issues. Other sources of information include reviews of biosecurity basics and good management practices for preventing infectious diseases and biosecurity of feedstuffs (Buhman et Thomson, 2011; Kerr, 2017). All of these publications offer information and suggestions that could be evaluated for their impact on the design of an animal facility. It is essential that agricultural animal care staff maintain a high standard of biosecurity to protect the animals from pathogenic organisms that can be trans- ferred by humans. Preventing the introduction of dis- ease agents is a continuous challenge, particularly when teaching and research facilities allow public access. Herd and flock health and sanitation programs should be in place to minimize exposure to pathogens. Animal care personnel in research and teaching facili- ties should not be in contact with livestock and poultry elsewhere unless strict biosecurity precautions are fol- lowed. To reduce inter-building transmission of patho- genic microorganisms, careful attention should be given to traffic patterns of inter-building personnel and dis- ease organisms in feed and transport vehicles. Barriers to microorganism transmission should be considered for personnel who move between houses, including shower- ing in, changing clothes, and the use of disinfectant footbaths as personnel move between rooms and build- ings. Establishing a barrier between animals and visi- tors requires visitors to do some or all of the following: shower in/shower out (including washing hair), wear clean footwear (i.e., plastic boots), change to on-site clothes, and wear only on-site clothes. If personnel are around an agricultural or restricted animal, the recom- mendation is that a period of time should elapse before interacting with animal species in the research setting. Seventy-two hours is a recommended elapse time, but other factors for controlling microorganisms, outlined above, can be used to shorten the elapsed time. In addi- tion, if personnel need to go back and forth between dif- ferent phases of production, it is critical that they work with younger animals first and then older animals, and work from clean to dirty phases of the farm.Major disease outbreaks (e.g., porcine epidemic di- arrhea, avian influenza) have been appearing in the United States on a regular basis since 2014. One simple way to enter facilities without shower-in/shower-out capabilities is the Danish entry system. Individuals en- ter the facility and stop at a bench, which creates a physical barrier, requiring them to cross over the bench to enter the animal facility. Dedicated footwear and clothing are located on the \"clean\" side, and individu- als change footwear and clothing before entering the animal facility (Janni et al., 2016). At a minimum, this type of system can provide a line of separation between a \"dirty\" and \"clean\" environment, allowing for minimal transmission and transportation of infectious diseases. Boot Cleaning and Disinfection The use of boot baths, dry or wet, can prevent or minimize mechanical transmission of pathogens among groups of animals or operations. Visible organic ma- terial may be removed from boots using water and a brush or a specific boot-cleaning station. Boots may be disinfected by soaking in a clean bath of an appropriate disinfectant following the manufacturer's guidelines for dilution rate and exposure time. Personnel are recom- mended to step into and scrub their boots in the boot bath upon entry and when leaving the room or facility. It is important to frequently empty, clean, and refill the boot bath to prevent it from being contaminated with organic matter. Disposable boots may be used. BIOCONTAINMENT Research or other activities with high-consequence livestock and poultry pathogens causing high morbid- ity and mortality (e.g., tuberculosis, foot and mouth disease) or the vectors carrying these pathogens (e.g., mosquitoes, ticks) must be conducted in biocontain- ment. These pathogens can have a significant regional, national, and global economic impact. The use of these pathogens in agricultural research brings several chal- lenges when designing and operating an animal facility. The design of this type of facility should strive for flex- ibility, effective containment of pathogens, and mini- mizing the risk of exposure to personnel when zoonotic agents are utilized. The use of agricultural animals in high-consequence livestock pathogen research requires a thorough understanding of a variety of regulatory requirements and the concept of risk assessment. The USDA provides a list of livestock, poultry, and fish pathogens that are classified as \"pathogens of veteri- nary significance\" in Appendix D of the book Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL; CDC, 2009). The use of these pathogens requires fa- cilities that meet specific criteria for design, operation, and containment features, which are described in the BMBL. For the listed agents, criteria may include uti- lizing containment levels designated as Animal Bio-25 CHAPTER 3: HUSBANDRY, HOUSING, AND BIOSECURITY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020safety Level (ABSL)-2, enhanced ABSL-3, BSL-3-Ag, or ABSL-4. Requirements for BSL-3-Ag facilities must be met when any of the listed pathogens are used in animals and the room housing the animals provides the primary containment (i.e., animals are loose-housed in the room). When the studies can be accomplished in smaller species in which animals are housed in primary containment devices, which allows the room to serve as the secondary barrier, then enhanced ABSL-3 re- quirements can be utilized. Enhancements to ABSL-3 should be determined on a case-by-case basis, using risk assessment, and in consultation with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the USDA. In addition to the BMBL, facility design standards have been published by the USDA to guide the design of Agricultural Research Service (ARS) construction projects. These standards include useful information on the design of containment facilities for agricultural research, addressing hazard classification and choice of containment, containment equipment, and facility de- sign issues for the different levels of biocontainment (USDA-ARS, 2002). Although published to provide guidance for National Institutes of Health (NIH)-fund- ed construction projects and renovations for biomedi- cal research facilities, the NIH Design Requirements Manual (NIH, 2016a) contains useful information on construction of BSL-3 and ABSL-3 facilities. The use of recombinant DNA molecules in agricultural research can introduce additional considerations when design- ing an animal facility. Published guidelines provide recommendations for physical and biological contain- ment for recombinant DNA research involving animals (NIH, 2016b). These guidelines include a supplement published in 2006 that provides additional information specific to the use of lentiviral vectors (NIH, 2006). The Agricultural Bioterrorism Protection Act of 2002 required the propagation of regulations that address the possession, use, and transfer of select agents and toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to plants or animals, and their products. The USDA- APHIS published the implementing regulation covering animals and animal products, which identifies those se- lect agents and toxins that are a threat solely to ani- mals and animal products (Veterinary Services select agents and toxins) and overlap agents, or those agents that pose a threat to public health and safety, to ani- mal health, or to animal products (CFR, 2005). Over- lap select agents and toxins are subject to regulation by both APHIS and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CFR, 2002). The regulations implemented by both agencies reference the BMBL and the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (NIH, 2016b) as sources to consider when developing physical structure and fea- tures and operational and procedural safeguards. Other issues discussed in some of these references may not directly affect containment of pathogens or safety of personnel but should be considered because they may affect the design of a facility. For example, the use of select agents requires certain security measures to be in place that restrict access to areas where select agents or toxins are used or stored. This can include laboratories, animal rooms, and storage freezers, resulting in a sig- nificant impact on how a research facility is designed. A thorough understanding of the references cited in this section is advised before initiating the design of new biocontainment facilities or renovation of existing facili- ties to accommodate research with hazardous agents or toxins requiring containment.

Envi- ronmental enrichment is increasingly viewed as a sig- nificant component of refinement efforts for animals used in research and teaching in certain situations; for example, when opportunities for social interactions are not available or where the animals' physical environ- ment is restricted or lacking in complexity. Environmental enrichment has wide-ranging physi- ological and behavioral effects on a variety of animal species (Young, 2003). It can be particularly effective in research settings to reduce the incidence or severity of undesirable or abnormal behaviors. Abnormal behav- iors observed in farm animals include locomotor stereo- typies, such as weaving, pacing, and route tracing, and mouth-based behaviors, such as wool eating by sheep, feather pecking and cannibalism by poultry, bar biting by pigs, tongue rolling by cattle, and wind sucking by horses (Price, 2008). These behaviors can cause injury to the animal performing them or to other animals in the social group and are most commonly observed in situations in which the quality or quantity of space pro- vided to the animal is inadequate. Environmental en- richment may reduce the frequency or severity of these behaviors or even prevent them from developing in the first place (Mason et al., 2007). Unfortunately, the term \"environmental enrichment\" does not have a precise definition and is used incon- sistently (Newberry, 1995; Young, 2003), often refer- ring simply to changes that involve adding one or more objects to an animal's enclosure rather than specify- ing the desired endpoints of these changes. Newberry (1995) suggested that the endpoint of enrichment is to improve the biological functioning of the animal. Therefore, goals of enrichment programs include (1) increasing the number and range of normal behaviors shown by the animal; (2) preventing the development of abnormal behaviors or reducing their frequency or severity; (3) increasing positive environmental interac- tions (e.g., the use of space); or (4) increasing the ani- mal's ability to cope with behavioral and physiological challenges such as exposure to humans, experimental manipulation, or environmental variation. There are important practical considerations in- volved in providing animals with enrichments, includ-ing those related to animal safety (Bayne, 2005). For example, animals can sustain injuries from environmen- tal enrichment, such as intestinal obstruction due to the provision of foraging enrichments or items that can be chewed and ingested (Hahn et al., 2000; Seier et al., 2005). In addition, perches are an often-recommended method of enrichment for laying hens. However, re- search has found that 80% of hens housed in systems that provided perches had keel bone damage (Wilkins et al., 2011). Thus, it is very important to monitor en- vironmental enrichments on a regular schedule specific to the situation for both health and safety concerns. Other enrichment considerations are related to facility design, cost, sanitation, ease of management (including the amount of time and effort that caretakers put into maintaining the enrichment program), and potential ef- fects on research outcomes. Genetic differences between breeds, lines, or strains of agricultural animals may also be present that affect their use of or responses to en- richment (e.g., Hill et al., 1998). To determine which type of enrichment is best suited for a particular situa- tion, it is important to seek input from institutional an- imal care and use committees (IACUC), veterinarians, researchers, and the caretakers who will be responsible for the day-to-day implementation of the enrichment program (Weed and Raber, 2005). Ideally, enrichment strategies should be science-based and based on species-specific behavior and physiology, as well as sufficiently sustained attractiveness (e.g., ro- tate enrichment items) and utility to the animals to achieve the desired outcomes. Bloomsmith et al. (1991) provided a useful categorization of enrichment types, adapted below: 1. Social enrichment involves direct or indi- rect (visual, olfactory, auditory) contact with conspecics (other individuals of the same spe- cies) or humans. 2. Occupational enrichment, which encompasses both psychological enrichment (e.g., devices that provide animals with control or challenges) and enrichment that encourages exercise. 3. Physical enrichment, which can involve altering the size or complexity of the animal's enclosure or adding accessories to the enclosure such as CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT 30objects, substrate, or permanent structures (e.g., nestboxes). 4. Sensory enrichment involves stimuli that are vi- sual (e.g., television or video), auditory (music, vocalizations), or in other modalities (e.g., olfac- tory, tactile, taste). 5. Nutritional enrichment involves either present- ing varied or novel food types or changing the method of food delivery. Various studies have assessed all of these types of enrichment for use with agricultural animals. Nonethe- less, continued assessment of outcomes is critical to en- sure that the enrichment program is effectively meeting the intended goals. It is also essential to be aware that when an enrichment type (i.e., nutritional evaluation) is part of the experimental study, it is contraindicated. Observations of animal behavior, health, performance characteristics, and use of the enrichments are essential components of such an assessment. For outcomes to be assessed adequately, it is important that individu- als who are making the observations be appropriately trained in sampling methods and that these methods are standardized across raters. In the following sections, discussion focuses on vali- dated or potential enrichments for each species as ap- propriate. All agricultural animals are social (except for the adult boar), and social behavior and management of social groups are covered in the respective species chapters. CATTLE Social Enrichment Calves. Dairy calves, which are conventionally sepa- rated from the cow at birth, should be kept in social contact with at least one other calf for the majority of the milk-feeding period. Welfare benefits of social con- tact are well-supported by literature (as reviewed by Costa et al., 2016; see also Chapter 7: Dairy Cattle). For dairy calves, individual housing has historically been recommended to reduce disease transmission. However, evidence suggests that housing calves in small, well- managed groups (<8 calves) does not increase morbid- ity compared with individual housing (Svensson et al., 2003; also reviewed by Costa et al., 2016). Social con- tact encourages greater solid feed intake and weight gain in preweaning calves (Jensen et al., 2015), allows for social bonding and the development of social be- haviors (F\u00e6revik et al., 2006; Duve et al., 2012), and improves cognition (Gaillard et al., 2014) and ability to adapt to postweaning grouping more readily (De Paula Vieira et al., 2010). Cross sucking can occur in group- housed calves but can be reduced by feeding calves a high milk allowance through a nipple or the provision of hay (Jung and Lidfors, 2001; Castells et al., 2012). Group housing of calves also may reduce tongue rolling in cattle (Seo et al., 1998). Cattle. It is recommended that adult cattle be pro- vided with social housing (see also Chapter 3: Hus- bandry, Housing, and Biosecurity and Chapter 7: Dairy Cattle). Dairy cattle that are isolated from conspecifics for 15 min will show physiological and behavioral signs of stress, including increased heart rate, cortisol con- centrations, defecation/urination, and high-frequency vocalizations (Rushen et al., 1999). Beef cattle sepa- rated from conspecifics in a restraint device for 6 h are more likely to have dark-cutting meat, a physical sign of stress (Apple et al., 2005). If cattle must be isolated, it is recommended that they have at least visual and auditory contact with other cattle. Cattle benefit from group living, but moving cows between groups (regrouping or remixing) can be stressful. Dairy cows moved into a new social group are more likely to experience physical displacements from the feed bunk, spend less time lying, and pro- duce less milk on the day of regrouping than on previ- ous days (von Keyserlingk et al., 2008). Thus, mini- mizing regrouping is recommended, and cattle should be kept in stable groups when possible. If regrouping is necessary, it is recommended that cattle be moved into low-stocked pens and by moving more than one animal at a time into a new pen, as these practices can limit stress-related behavior (Neisen et al., 2009; Talebi et al., 2014). Human-Animal Interactions. See Chapter 5: Ani- mal Handling and Transport for a detailed summary of animal handling and transport for beef and dairy cattle. Research on cattle-human interactions indicates that animals benefit from gentle and confident han- dlers using low-stress handling techniques (Hemsworth et al., 2000). Negative human behavior, such as hitting, shouting, and rough handling, should be avoided, as it is stressful for cattle and may lead to the development of a conditioned fear response to handlers (Pajor et al., 2000, 2003). Positive human behavior such as gentle stroking on the animal's neck is recommended when it is safe and practical, as this can reduce fear- and stress-related behaviors in beef calves and dairy cattle (Schmied et al., 2008; Probst et al., 2012). Occupational Enrichment Calves. Calves should be housed in pens that pro- vide them enough space to turn around and lie down comfortably. Exercise is important at all stages of life for cattle. Young animals obtain exercise by engaging in physical play behavior directed at conspecifics or objects (Held and pinka, 2011). Calves are strongly motivated to engage in play behavior (Jensen, 2001). Play behavior is facilitated by group housing compared to individual housing (Jensen et al., 1997; Valn\u00edkov\u00e1 et 31 CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020al., 2015) and by increasing pen space allowance (Jen- sen and Kyhn, 2000). Cattle. All cattle should be provided some daily ex- ercise, including the ability to walk or run around their pen, lot, pasture, range, or other types of loose-housing (Veissier et al., 2008). Tied cattle should also have daily exercise, such as outdoor access to walk, run, and groom themselves. Dairy cattle kept in tie stalls given daily exercise had fewer illnesses requiring veterinary atten- tion and fewer hock injuries (Gustafson, 1993), as well as lower incidences of lameness, teat injuries (Regula et al., 2004), and mastitis (Popescu et al., 2013) compared with animals that were not exercised. A lack of exercise may increase the time it takes cows to lie down and stand up, suggesting negative effects on joints and ten- dons due to lack of movement and exercise (Gustafson and Lund-Magnussen, 1995). Access to pasture or range is also beneficial to cattle when it is well managed, and shade is provided for ther- mal comfort (see Chapter 6: Beef Cattle and Chapter 7: Dairy Cattle). Dairy cows are highly motivated to access pasture when given the opportunity (von Key- serlingk et al., 2017). Access to pasture during sum- mer has been shown to reduce the risk of injuries and lameness in tied dairy cows (Corazzin et al., 2010) and lameness in dairy cows housed in freestalls (Chapinal et al., 2013). Physical Enrichment Calves. Providing a more complex physical environ- ment for calves can have benefits. For example, housing a group of calves in a pen divided by a wall can de- crease agonistic interactions between calves compared with an open pen (Ninomiya and Sato, 2009). Providing calves with more complex and variable environments may also encourage play behavior and exercise. Add- ing fresh bedding (e.g., sawdust or straw) to a group pen can stimulate play behavior (Jensen et al., 1998). Providing calves with other physical enrichments such as a brush or hanging balls can encourage grooming and play behaviors (Bulens et al., 2014; Pempek et al., 2017; Toaff-Rosenstein et al., 2017). Cattle. Providing beef and dairy animals that are due to give birth with physical barriers that allow them to separate themselves from the other cows may be benefi- cial. In nature, beef and dairy cows will seek a secluded area in which to give birth (Lidfors et al., 1994), and dairy cows housed singly indoors are also motivated to seek seclusion at calving (Proudfoot et al., 2014a,b). For dairy cattle, hospital and sick pens should be in a quiet area and provide cattle with the opportunity to seclude if they choose; these pens should also al- low for easy access for caretakers (described in more detail in Chapter 7: Dairy Cattle). Research has shown that dairy cows will seek a more isolated space when they have an infectious disease after calving (Proudfoot et al., 2014a) but not when they are lame (Jensen et al., 2015). Allowing cattle the opportunity to physi- cally separate from other animals may reduce agonistic behaviors in a group setting. For example, dairy cows given access to a loafing area outside of their pen ex- perienced fewer agonistic behaviors than those in pen without a loafing area (Haskell et al., 2013). It is recommended that cattle have access to an out- let for grooming. When cattle are on pasture, they use trees or other objects to groom parts of their bodies that they cannot reach themselves. Indoors, cattle groom themselves on fences, metal gates, and other ob- jects in pen. Cattle can benefit from access to a groom- ing apparatus that allows them to groom all parts of their bodies without having to use various parts of the pen. Grooming devices such as stationary and rotating brushes are used by cattle (DeVries et al., 2007; Mandel and Nicol, 2017), but rotating brushes are preferred (Gutmann, 2010). Giving dairy cows access to a brush can result in better hygiene and improved milk yield (Schukken and Young, 2009). Nutritional Enrichment Calves. Young calves have a strong motivation to suckle. An artificial teat should be provided to help satisfy this drive for functional consequences of sucking (release of hormones involved in digestion; de Passill\u00e9 et al., 1993) and to reduce the occurrence of redirected oral behaviors and cross sucking (Jung and Lidfors, 2001) if and whenever possible. In addition to free access to pelleted starter diet, provision of chopped low-quality hay to dairy calves has been shown to encourage greater solid feed intake and reduce nonnutritive oral behavior (Castells et al., 2012), suggesting that chopped hay is a beneficial addi- tion to the diet of preweaning calves. However, Hill et al. (2010) found that as roughage in the diet increased, growth in weaned calves declined. Thus, roughage may have benefits for behavioral enrichment but impair other biological functions dependent upon the age and stage of production. Further, preweaning dairy calves will select within a mixed diet in favor of chopped hay, suggesting they may be motivated to obtain it (Miller- Cushon et al., 2013). Cattle. Cattle are at risk of developing oral stereo- typic behavior such as tongue rolling, tongue playing, bar-biting, chain chewing, and biting other objects. Re- stricted feeding regimens and low levels of forage and fiber in the diet may drive these behaviors in dairy cattle (Redbo et al., 1996, Redbo and Nordblad, 1997), although dietary effects on nonnutritive oral behavior are less well studied in beef cattle (reviewed by Ridge et al., 2020). Providing dairy cows with ad libitum ac- cess to feed and diets high in forage can reduce oral stereotypic behavior. Weather permitting, access to well-managed pasture or range is beneficial and recommended for all cattle (see previous section on Occupational Enrichment). 32 CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020Dairy cattle do not exhibit stereotypic tongue rolling while at pasture, as their motivation to graze has been satiated (Redbo, 1990). Sensory Enrichment Dairy and beef cows have sensitive hearing due to their large pinnae that amplify sound waves, and cows can hear at much higher frequencies than humans (Hef- fner and Heffner, 1983). Loud noises such as human shouting or metal clanging are aversive stimuli and cause stress in both beef and dairy cattle (Waynert et al., 1999; Pajor et al., 2000). Quiet environments may be especially important for dairy cattle, as they are more reactive to sound than beef cattle (Lanier et al., 2000). Although music and noise can serve as a cue that will synchronize attendance at an automatic milking machine (Uetake et al., 1997), dairy cows will avoid noise, such as noxious radio music and sounds of the milking machine or sounds associated with milking when given a choice (Arnold et al., 2008). High-pitched noises should also be avoided because these can damage hearing and alter feeding behavior (Kyc et al., 2013). Providing quiet, low-pitched music during noisy proce- dures such as milking may have benefits for dairy cows. For example, when classical music was played in the milking parlor, cows had higher milk let-down speed than those not exposed to music in the parlor (Kyc et al., 2013). Fewer studies have assessed the effects of other sen- sory enrichments, such as vision and olfaction. Limited research shows that cows may not specifically benefit from seeing outdoor pasture spaces when housed in- doors (e.g., Haskell et al., 2013). Olfactory enrichment may also be important for cattle, as they have a keen sense of smell and can detect scents that are not de- tectable by humans. However, there is limited research to date evaluating possible benefits of olfactory enrich- ments (reviewed by Mandel et al., 2016). HORSES Social Enrichment When housing horses, they should be provided with visual and auditory contact with conspecifics. As a herd species, horses are highly motivated to interact with individuals of their species for comfort, play, access to food and shelter resources, and as an anti-predator strategy. During fearful situations and when separated from closely bonded companions, restlessness, pacing, and vocalizations occur and suggest experiences of acute anxiety and distress. Horses housed singly display greater activity and reduced foraging behavior com- pared with horses kept in pairs or groups (Houpt and Houpt, 1988). Horses housed singly also display more aggression toward human handlers and learn new tasks more slowly than horses housed in groups (S\u00f8ndergaard and Ladewig, 2004). Confining horses for extended pe- riods may produce behavioral problems (depression or aggression) that sometimes progress to exhibiting ste- reotypies. Examples include stall weaving, cribbing, or wind sucking. Thus, horses should be given access to a pasture or paddock regularly. Management efforts to minimize stereotypies due to social deprivation have included the provision of companionship such as that provided by another horse or pony, or even a goat, cat, dog, or chickens. In feral and wild situations, horses maintain long- term relationships. Stallions and mares stay together year-round over multiple breeding seasons, whereas colts and fillies emigrate from the natal herd when they are juveniles (Feh, 2005). Mare-mare bonds are very stable and persist for years. However, social interac- tions decrease markedly during the postparturient pe- riod when mares direct social behavior toward their foals (van Dierendonck et al., 2004). For mares and fillies, social bonds are likely to develop between indi- viduals that are familiar, closely related, and similar in social rank (Heitor et al., 2006). Mutual grooming and maintaining proximity characterize social relationships among females (Kimura, 1998; van Dierendonck et al., 2004). In the absence of these factors, social bonds are directed toward unfamiliar individuals that have the same coat color as the filly's dam (Sawford et al., 2005). Mutual grooming is directed toward the withers and neck region and is associated with reduced heart rate (Feh and de Mazieres, 1993), suggesting a role in re- ducing anxiety. Stallions, except after periods of social deprivation, rarely groom each other (Crowell-Davis et al., 1986; Christensen et al., 2002). Colts and geldings are highly motivated to play with each other. When housed in extensive conditions, colts perform hourly play bouts, such as mock fighting, whereas mares do not typically engage in this behavior (Snorrason et al., 2003). Stallions are typically housed singly because aggres- sion and play behaviors can result in injuries. Repro- ductive status influences aggression, with greater ag- gression occurring in established groups during the breeding and foaling season (Grogan and McDonnell, 2005). Conversely, in mixed groups, mares display more aggression in the postparturient period, primarily in the form of interventions to protect foals from barren mares and geldings (Rutberg and Greenberg, 1990; van Dierendonck et al., 2004). Similarly, during feeding tri- als, yearling females perform significantly more agonis- tic interactions (e.g., head threats, biting, kicking) than geldings of the same age, likely because of circulating steroid levels at estrus (Motch et al., 2007). When horses are housed singly or in isolation fa- cilities, horses should be provided visual contact with other equids to prevent distress associated with social deprivation. Weaving and head-nodding stereotypies, 33 CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020which are associated with frustration (Mills and Rie- zebos, 2005), are significantly reduced when horses can see other equids through grilled side windows (Cooper et al., 2000), or when mirrors (McAfee et al., 2002) or life-sized posters of horse face images (Mills and Rieze- bos, 2005) are placed in the stalls. Lateral visual con- tact appears to be important because weaving is sig- nificantly more likely to occur when stalls are arranged face-to-face than side-by-side (Ninomiya et al., 2007). In the absence of equids, horses readily form social relationships with other species, such as goats, dogs, and humans. Intensively managed horses detect and re- spond to subtle indicators of emotional state and con- fidence in their human handlers, eliciting both fearful- ness and calmness (Chamove et al., 2002; von Borstel, 2007; von Borstel et al., 2007). Horses accept grooming by humans; heart rate is reduced when horses perform mutual grooming (Feh and de Mazieres, 1993) and when humans brush or scratch the withers and neck re- gions (Lynch et al., 1974; Hama et al., 1996). However, this positive association with tactile stimulation by hu- mans appears to be learned rather than innate (Henry et al., 2006). In the absence of positive interactions, foals begin to avoid humans at 3 wk of age (Lansade et al., 2007). Occupational Enrichment In the absence of turning out in paddocks or pastures, horses can direct play behavior toward \"toys\" placed in the stall. Several commercially available products, such as the large, durable balls designed to be used with stabled horses, can be provided, as well as homemade devices such as plastic jugs hanging on ropes. Scien- tific evidence regarding the efficacy of these products is lacking. Bulens et al. (2013) provided horses with a plastic bottle filled with sand and a rope. They found very limited use of the items, with the least use ob- served when hay was not provided. They found similar results (Bulens et al., 2015) when providing a ball with an apple odor or a rope, noting that non-edible items do not appear useful as enrichments. Physical Enrichment Horses should be given the opportunity to exercise on a regular basis. Horses provided access to paddocks or pasture can alleviate foraging motivation through grazing, but horses also benefit from opportunities to exercise, with activity positively associated with pad- dock size (J\u00f8rgensen and Boe, 2007). Horses appear to be motivated to perform exercise in its own right, with motivation building up and compensatory activity performed after periods of deprivation (Houpt et al., 2001; Christensen et al., 2002; Chaya et al., 2006). Fur- thermore, horses provided with turnout display more varied rolling behavior, which is believed to be associ-ated with comfort (Hansen et al., 2007). In a study of racing horses, benefits of regular turn-out also included less aggression directed toward handlers (Drissler et al., 2006) and superior race and career performance (Drissler, 2006). Interestingly, Whisher et al. (2011) found that horses that were exercised for 20 min in a round pen cribbed more than horses that were not exercised. When comparing horses turned out individu- ally 3 times per week with those turned out daily in a group, Lansade et al. (2014) found that horses that had daily turn-out in a group had decreased fearful- ness, better learning, a decreased stress response, and increased immune responsiveness. Sensory Enrichment In stables, it is common for background radio noise to be provided, with the assumption that this noise has a calming effect on the horses and alleviates boredom. However, the presence or type of music was not found to significantly affect the behavior of ponies subjected to short-term isolation distress (Houpt et al., 2000). Those authors speculate that background music may indirectly affect equine behavior through the attitudes of their human caretakers. Nutritional Enrichment Horses should be given forage material daily. Op- portunities to forage provide significant enrichment for stabled horses. Horses typically spend 10 to 12 h grazing per day (Ralston, 1984), and lactating mares spend 70% of their time grazing on pasture (Crowell- Davis et al., 1985). In the absence of foraging mate- rial, horses frequently direct foraging toward the stall bedding or stall surfaces (Drissler et al., 2006), or may display oral stereotypies such as crib biting, wind suck- ing, sham chewing, hair eating, and wood chewing or licking. Undesirable oral behavior can be suppressed by providing at least 6.8 kg of hay per day (McGreevy et al., 1995), providing multiple forages (Goodwin et al., 2002; Thorne et al., 2005), dividing concentrate feed into smaller and more frequent meals throughout the day (Cooper et al., 2005), and feeding oats instead of a sweetened grain diet (Whisher et al., 2011). Horses provided with straw bedding perform less stereotyp- ic behavior than those bedded on paper or shavings (Cooper et al., 2005). J\u00f8rgensen et al. (2011) provid- ed horses with 1 of 7 different enrichments, including edible items (such as straw, branches, feed ball) and non-edible items (such as ball, cone, and pole); they found that horses directed their behavior toward ed- ible items more, and access to straw decreased agonis- tic behavior in group-housed horses. Several food toys are commercially available, which horses manipulate to obtain high-fiber food pellets. These food balls result in increased foraging time (Winskill et al., 1996) and 34 CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020reduced stereotypic behavior (Henderson and Waran, 2001). Toys with round or polyhedral designs are most effective (Goodwin et al., 2007). Providing these toys in the manger can prevent horses from ingesting patho- gens and nonnutritive materials from the stall bedding. SWINE An enriched environment may enhance the well-be- ing of pigs by increasing behavioral diversity, adaptabil- ity, and learning while reducing aggression, fearfulness, stereotyped behaviors, and other inappropriate behav- iors (e.g., 2000; Sneddon et al., et al., 2000; Day et al., al., 2013). It is im- portant that the material or object provided as a form of enrichment meet at least some of the following at- tributes: edible (or feed-like), chewable, investigable, or manipulable, so that the item remains novel and is safe for the pig (Guy et al., 2013; AHDB, 2017). The sub- strates that are most beneficial to pig welfare include substrates made of straw or a composite mix (Bracke et al., 2006), whereas other items such as synthetic ropes, tires, and treated wood or wood that may contain nails may be unsafe and should not be used (AHDB, 2017); however, if ropes are used, they need to be of natural fiber as consumption of synthetic materials is not ac- ceptable. Social Enrichment Housing pigs in stable social groups with ample space and environmental complexity enables them to adjust their proximity to different individuals according to their social relationships and current state. Alternative housing systems that minimize regrouping and social stress are recommended Parratt et al., 2006). Social contact, both direct and indirect, may also be considered a form of enrichment in and of itself. For example, DeBoer et al. (2013) found that a conspecific located on the other side of a fence resulted in increased investigatory be- havior and, in the presence of a human, pigs preferred access to a mirror instead of the human. These authors suggest that pigs may be using the mirror as a form of social support during the perceived threat of the hu- man's presence. When pigs are isolated from conspecifics for experi- mental purposes, friendly social contact with familiar caretakers can be beneficial. Pigs recognize familiar caretakers using visual (body size and facial features), vocal, and olfactory cues (Koba and Tanida, 2001). Caretakers can develop positive social contact with pigs by moving slowly and calmly, crouching to reduce apparent body size, avoiding aversive or inconsistent (sometimes pleasant, while other times aversive) han-dling, and stroking or scratching any pig that approach- es them (Hemsworth et al., 1996). If pig-caretaker in- teractions are positive, pigs will confidently approach and seek interaction with them. Positive pig-caretaker interaction may enhance the handling experience for both pig and caretaker. Moreover, when piglets are weaned at an early age (14 d of age) for experimental reasons, providing companionship by grouping together with familiar pen-mates and providing a warm, artifi- cial udder with flexible nipples if possible may decrease distress in these early-weaned piglets (Jeppesen, 1982; Weary et al., 1999a; Toscano and 2005; Widowski et al., 2005; Colson et al., 2006; Bench and Gonyou, 2007). Occupational Enrichment Occupational enrichment is achieved by allowing and promoting physical exercise, foraging, exploration, nest building, playing, and manipulative and cognitive ac- tivities, and it is recommended that some form is used. Most research has focused on the use of straw as an enrichment material. Straw is a good choice because it safe, edible, chewable, investigatable, and manipulable. Moreover, access to pasture, soil, peat, mushroom com- post, hay, bark, branches, logs, and other manipulable materials helps provide an outlet for exploration, sniff- ing, biting, rooting, and chewing activities, reducing the likelihood that these behaviors will be redirected toward the bodies of pen-mates or pen fixtures. Also, even if straw is used as bedding, providing additional straw can be used as a form of enrichment. Pigs are initially attracted to materials that are odor- ous, deformable, and chewable, but for sustained oc- cupational enrichment, the best materials by day 5 for sustaining attention are complex, ingestible, destruc- tible, and contained but not particulate or de Weerd et al., 2003; Bracke, 2007; Studnitz et al., 2007). Thus, pigs prefer to root in and manipu- late materials such as corn silage mixed with straw, compost, turf, peat, forest soil, beets, spruce chips, or fir branches. Long straw is a useful enrichment mate- rial and tends to be more effective than chopped straw, sand, or ropes, and other indestructible objects such as hoses, chains, and tires (Tuyttens, 2005; van de Weerd et al., 2005; Scott et al., 2006; Jensen and Pedersen, 2007; Studnitz et al., 2007; Day et al., 2008; Zonder- land et al., 2008; van de Weerd and Day, 2009). The amount of behavior directed toward long straw rather than toward pen-mates is proportional to the amount of straw provided (Kelly et al., 2000; Day et al., 2002). Negative behaviors toward other pigs are reduced when pigs have access to long straw that is provided via a rack (Bulens et al., 2015). Others have found that pro- viding straw only after tail biting has started can re- duce the behavior, but it does not act as a complete curative. Providing straw from an early age helps to prevent tail biting, lowers aggression, and maintains normal activity (Day et al., 2002; Bolhuis et al., 2006; 35 CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020Chaloupkov\u00e1 et al., 2007). Lahrmann et al. (2018) also found that when weaner pigs were given increased ac- cess to enrichment at the start of a tail-biting outbreak, tail biting was reduced by the provision of extra straw or haylage compared with controls, who were given 2 wooden posts and 400 g of straw daily. Fu et al. (2018) provided 8 rubber toys per pen and found that weaned pigs had fewer injuries on their ears, docked tails, and the front of their bodies, and a decrease in respiration rate. Conversely, Chou et al. (2018) gave finisher pigs a choice of 4 different types of wood as enrichment; the pigs preferred spruce to the other types, but none of the wood types was effective in reducing tail, ear, or flank biting. Moreover, it is important to note that the risk of tail biting can be elevated, and activity depressed, if pigs initially reared with straw are subsequently housed without straw (Day et al., 2002; Bolhuis et al., 2006). Long straw is preferred over cloth tassels as a nesting material although the latter may have some benefit in liquid-manure systems that preclude the use of straw (Widowski and Curtis, 1990). Loose housing of sows allows freedom of movement, leading to a shorter far- rowing duration and lower stress at parturition rela- tive to confinement in crates, and the risk of injuries can be reduced by secure footing and well-managed bedding (Lawrence et al., 1994; Marchant and Broom, et al., 2002; Karlen et al., 2007; Oliviero et al., 2008). Pens with stalls along with communal activ- ity and resting areas allow gestating sows in groups to move freely and rest together while enabling tem- porary separation in stalls for feeding or experimental purposes. In addition, providing bedding gives ther- mal comfort in cool weather as well as cushioning the body against hard surfaces (Fraser et al., 1991; Tuyt- tens, 2005). Only good-quality bedding should be used to avoid introducing mycotoxin molds. Biosecurity is always a concern when introducing enrichments from outside of a premise. A balance between effective bi- osecurity and effective enrichments can be challenging but should be the goal. It is recommended that bedding be managed to avoid wet litter and high ammonia emis- sions. Research has shown that sows housed in systems with pens enriched with straw during farrowing and lactation had shorter deliveries, higher oxytocin con- centrations, and lower salivary cortisol (Chaloupkov\u00e1 et al., 2011). Moreover, prepartum nest building by sows resulted in improved colostrum intake by the piglets during early lactation (Yun et al., 2014a) and positively affected piglet survival and performance (Yun et al., 2014b). At least 24 h before farrowing, provision of an earth or sand substrate along with straw, branches, or other nesting materials enables sows to express their strong motivation to engage in nest-building behavior. Un- der natural conditions, nest building involves digging a shallow depression with the snout and then gathering nesting materials such as long grass, twigs, and branch- es, carrying them to the nest site in the mouth, and arranging them into a nest (Jensen, 1989, 1993). Nest- building behavior was increased among gilts housed in straw-bedded pens while abnormal behaviors were reduced, especially oral manipulation of the pen bars (Yin et al., 2016). Providing nest-building materials can also favorably influence maternal behavior (Herskin et al., 1998; Ringgenberg et al., 2012) and may contribute to early piglet survival (Herskin et al., 1998; Jarvis et al., 1999; Damm et al., 2005). In fact, Oostindjer et al. (2011) reported that providing loose-housed lactating sows with environmental enrichment improved piglet performance and health before and after weaning. Slatted floors and liquid-manure systems usually pre- clude the provision of ample amounts of long straw and other particulate foraging materials. In this situation, offering small amounts of such materials in racks or troughs, and replenishing the supply frequently stimu- lates sniffing, rooting, and chewing while maintaining a degree of novelty that is important for sustaining the interest of curious pigs. Providing pigs fed a liquid diet with a small amount of straw resulted in increased exploratory behavior and reduced tail biting and ear chewing (Scollo et al., 2013). When particulate materi- als cannot be used, hanging ropes with unraveled ends that can be pulled, shaken, chewed, and torn apart are the next best option (Jensen and Pedersen, 2007; Trickett et al., 2009). Less-destructible novel hanging objects can offer short-term enrichment by attracting exploration and stimulating play but they need to be changed frequently because pigs rapidly lose interest in such objects when they are no longer novel (van de Weerd et al., 2003; Gifford et al., 2007). Unattached objects at the floor level may be more attractive to pigs than hanging objects but become less engaging when these objects become soiled with excreta (van de Weerd et al., 2003). Manciocco et al. (2011) studied the simultaneous use of 4 enrichments (ropes, balls, chains, and hoses) over an 11-wk trial and found that enriched pigs had a lower neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and less tail and ear biting. Enrichment materials should be monitored to reduce the occurrence of health problems (e.g., strangulation, choking, poisoning, obstruction of the digestive tract, transmission of pathogens) or com- promised food safety. Supplying ample free access to preferred enrichment materials and objects will mini- mize aggressive competition for these resources. Interestingly, ice blocks may be more interesting to pigs than rubber toys, but ice blocks have no effect on other behaviors (Peralta and Rizzo, 2015). However, Nannoni et al. (2016) found that hanging chains were just as effective at maintaining \"welfare status\" as were edible blocks or wood bricks for post-weaning pigs for a duration of 45 d. Nowicki and Klocek (2012) found that hanging vanilla-scented cloth strips was effective in reducing aggression in newly weaned pigs. Use of enrichment materials can lower the risk of injuries and harassment from tail biting, ear chewing, and belly nos- ing, as well as reducing aggressive behavior and wear 36 CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020and tear on housing fixtures (Fraser et al., 1991; Beat- tie et al., 1995; Lay et al., 2000; H\u00f6tzel et al., 2004; Scollo et al., 2013). Others have found that different forms of enrichment materials such as corn silage or alfalfa hay have no effect on the incidence of tail biting (Veit et al., 2016). Moreover, offering opportunities for pigs to respond to environmental cues to find occasional food rewards and to work for access to foraging materials and hid- den food treats can be rewarding (Puppe et al., 2007; de Jonge et al., 2008). This type of environmental en- richment was shown to stimulate the immune system and speed up wound healing (Ernst et al., 2006). More specifically, pigs that had access to a specialized feeding system in which they located the feeding site acousti- cally and were rewarded with feed had smaller wounds and a more activated immune response at d 5 post- biopsy compared with control pigs (Ernst et al., 2006), implying that under certain circumstances some enrich- ment may have health benefits. Incorporating a nutritional reward in a rootable or chewable object increases its attractiveness over objects that do not provide food reinforcement (Day et al., 1996; van de Weerd et al., 2006). Although stereotyped behavior peaks in the period immediately following a meal, providing limit-fed sows a small food reward does not appear to cause stereotyped behavior when com- bined with loose housing in straw-bedded pens (Ter- louw et al., 1993; Haskell et al., 1996), even though it is recommended that sows receive their feed allotment in a single meal. Under these conditions, limit-fed sows can be extensively occupied by provision of food in de- vices that require work to extract it (e.g., the Edin- burgh foodball; Young et al., 1994). It is important to make sure that there are sufficient nutritional enrich- ment devices to avoid aggressive competition. Physical Enrichment The welfare implications of housing during gestation, individually in crates versus group housed in pens, is discussed in Chapter 9: Swine. Pigs show spatial separation of different behaviors such as lying, feeding, and excretion. Providing ample space or appropriate subdivision of the enclosure area enables the establishment of separate functional areas. Two-level pens that subdivide the pen space, thereby increasing exercise and movement opportunities, may facilitate easier handling and herding of pigs because the pigs already experience more movement (Fraser et al., 1986; Pedersen et al., 1993). Moreover, habituating pigs to ramps and alleys in the housing environment re- duces novelty-induced fear when pigs are subsequently handled (Lewis et al., 2008). Allowing pigs daily access to enriched areas that are not accessible full time can stimulate anticipation and play (Dudink et al., 2006; Casey et al., 2007). To avoid overcrowding and com- petition in one area of a subdivided or multi-level pen, it is recommended that calculation of stocking density and feeder space take into account variations in the distribution of pigs across different areas of the pen (Pedersen et al., 1993). Providing visual barriers helps pigs to avoid aggres- sive pen-mates. This can be achieved by installing solid partitions between feeding spaces, boxes, or holes in the wall where pigs can hide their heads (the prime target of aggression), straw bales, dividers between dif- ferent functional areas, or an upper pen level accessed by a ramp (Stolba and Wood-Gush, 1984; McGlone and Curtis, 1985; Fraser et 1986; Pedersen et al., 1993; Waran and Broom, 1993; Andersen et al., 1999). In outdoor pens, bushes, trees, and varied terrain can serve to create visually discrete areas. Certain types of artificial lying mats may also in- crease lying (Phillips et al., 1995; Tuyttens et al., 2008) and thermal comfort (Boyle et al., 2000; Tuyttens et al., 2008), and reduce lesions (Elmore et al., 2010). Pre- vious work by Elmore et al. (2010) indicated that sows prefer to rest on rubber mats, but sows in stalls are not motivated to access a rubber mat (Elmore et al., 2012). Others have shown that sows prefer compost and straw over other substrates (Bench et al., 2013). In outdoor pens, huts or kennels supplied with straw create suit- able lying areas in cold weather. In hot weather, wal- lows, snout coolers, or snout-operated showers aid ther- moregulation (Stansbury et al., 1987; McGlone et al., 1988). An earth substrate allows pigs to dig a simple depression in the ground for nesting. Shade can be used to protect outdoor pigs from heat stress and sunburn (Miao et al., 2004). Sensory Enrichment Pigs can learn to associate olfactory, vocal, and color cues with a food reward (Croney et al., 2003; Puppe et al., 2007). For example, pigs use the odor of dimethyl sulfide to locate buried truffles, a highly desired food item that has a musky garlic/mushroom flavor and con- tains the boar sex pheromone 5--androstenol (Talou et al., 1990). Pigs also seek opportunities to interact with materials that provide tactile stimulation of different areas of their snout and mouth (Dailey and McGlone, 1997). Sensory cues paired with rewards, including ac- cess to enrichment materials, can be used to stimulate anticipatory excitement and play (Dudink et al., 2006; Puppe et al., 2007). Habituation to a wide array of harmless sensory stimuli when young may reduce fear in novel situations when older, and exposure to sensory stimuli that evoke comforting associations may be help- ful at times of unavoidable stress. Pigs communicate through odors; therefore, it is recommended that decisions about cleaning regimens consider this if inter-animal communication will affect research or teaching objectives. It is important to avoid disruptive cleaning routines during the first week after farrowing, which is an important time for social attach- ment between the sow and her piglets and the estab- lishment of the teat order. Although moderate levels 37 CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020of ammonia do not appear to be highly aversive and do not disrupt social recognition (Jones et al., 1998; Kristensen et al., 2001), keeping ammonia to a mini- mum can facilitate exploration of diverse environmen- tal odors. Enrichment materials with noticeable odors attract exploration, and pigs show preferences for foods with certain odors or flavors, whereas materials soiled by excreta are aversive (van de Weerd et al., 2003; Bracke, 2007; Janz et al., 2007). Providing chewable tubes offering flavored water may not be sufficient to prevent tail biting (van de Weerd et al., 2006). Noise from fans and other equipment is unavoidable in commercial swine facilities, but to facilitate vocal communication between pigs, continuous loud noise (e.g., radios and human activity) should be kept to a minimum. This is especially important in the farrow- ing area because vocalizations between sows and piglets are important for social bonding and effective nursing, and masking these vocalizations with high levels of ambient sound can disrupt suckling behavior (Algers and Jensen, 1985, 1991). Piglets should be handled in a manner that minimizes loud distressed vocalizations. When significantly stressful procedures are performed (e.g., castration, tail docking), handling piglets outside the hearing range of sows is recommended. Silence is more effective in quieting piglets separated from the sow than playback of meditation music, white noise, or vocalizations of unfamiliar piglets (Cloutier et al., 2000). Furthermore, pigs are not especially attracted to enrichment materials that produce sound when ma- nipulated (van de Weerd et al., 2003; Bracke, 2007). Habituation to a variety of environmental sounds can help to reduce fear when pigs are moved to new envi- ronments, and playing a radio (following habituation) may be useful for masking sounds on occasions when sudden, unpredictable, loud noises are anticipated, such as those generated during construction. Pregnant sows housed in individual stalls and pens with stalls and subjected to music had a higher percentage of relax- ation behaviors and reduced expression of stereotypies compared with groups of sows without music (Silva et al., 2017). Nutritional Enrichment During pregnancy, sows may be fed a limited amount of a nutritionally balanced feed to prevent excessive weight gain, which may result in difficulties during far- rowing and lactation. Although the ration fulfills their nutrient requirements, the sows eat it quickly and may be hungry later in the day, especially if the entire feed allotment is offered once a day. The sows' normal re- sponse to hunger is to express foraging behavior. It is recommended that cotton rope be used as an alterna- tive to straw for expression of oral behaviors associ- ated with foraging (Feddes and Fraser, 1994) for feed- restricted sows in intensive systems; however, based on motivation behaviors, a cotton rope is not valuable en- richment for all sows housed in gestation stalls (Elmore et al., 2012). The motivation for access to a cotton rope varies greatly across sows and may be partially linked to a lack of satiety (de Jonge et al., 2008). Sows housed in stalls valued compost in a trough and straw in a rack over hanging cotton ropes (Elmore et al., 2012). When sows are housed in an environment with no outlet for diverse foraging behaviors, aggression may increase, foraging behavior may be channeled into a few ele- ments performed repetitively in stereotyped sequences (e.g., bar biting, sham chewing), or abnormal amounts of water may be consumed (Terlouw et al., 1991, 1993). Providing straw and other low or ingestible foraging substrates that occupy the sows in diverse foraging activities reduce these behaviors. Feeding a diet high in fermentable nonstarch polysaccharides (e.g., sugar beet pulp, soybean hulls) to increase satiety may also promote desirable foraging behaviors (Spoolder et al., 1995; Meunier-Sala\u00fcn et al., 2001; Robert et al., 2002; van der Peet-Schwering et al., 2003; de Leeuw et al., 2005). When sows are housed in group pens during ges- tation, the use of straw and other manipulable objects may help to reduce aggression and incidence of injuries that commonly occur among group-housed sows (An- dronie et al., 2010). Feeding a high-fiber diet to sows does not always affect stereotyped oral-nasal-facial be- haviors among group-housed sows (McGlone and Full- wood, 2001). However, recent data indicate that it is plausible to reduce oral-nasal-facial behaviors among small group-housed sows when kept at 1.7 m2 per sow instead of 2.3 m2 and fed a high-fiber diet, which may be reflective of altering oral behaviors associated with pre- and post-feeding behaviors, but does not affect sa- tiety (DeDecker et al., 2014). Zwicker et al. (2013) compared restricted-fed finish- ing pigs with full-fed finishers that were all provided with 8 enrichment materials, finding that pigs fed ad libitum spent less time exploring pen enclosures and flooring. The incidence of gastric lesions may be re- duced in pigs given straw compared with those lacking access to roughage (Bolhuis et al., 2007). Overall, these edible sources of enrichment for pigs affect some behav- iors but do not necessarily serve as a nutritional source of enrichment per se. SHEEP AND GOATS Social Enrichment Sheep. Sheep are highly social animals and develop abnormal behaviors, including pacing and oral stereo- typic behavior, when penned individually (Lauber et al., 2012). If social contact is limited, sheep should have visual contact with other sheep through fencing or other transparent materials. It has also been suggested that a mirror or an inanimate object covered with animal skin could serve as a social surrogate. Mirrors can reduce but do not abolish the physiological stress response to social isolation in sheep (Parrott et al., 1988). However, because sheep appear to treat their own reflection as a 38 CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020strange individual, it is also possible that a mirror im- age could cause social stress (Reinhardt and Reinhardt, 2002). Goats. Goats are highly gregarious and social ani- mals (Miranda-de la Lama and Mattiello, 2010). So- cial isolation can result in physiological and behavioral signs of stress (Kannan et al., 2002), and social isola- tion of the doe during gestation can result in higher stress reactivity in her subsequent offspring (Duvaux- Ponter et al., 2003; Roussel et al., 2005). If social con- tact is limited, goats should be provided visual contact with other goats. Human-Animal Interactions. Goats and sheep can develop strong bonds with humans when they are han- dled positively (Anderson et al., 2004). Goat kids that are handled gently are calmer and easier to approach and are able to cope with stressors better (Boivin and Braastad, 1996). Occupational and Physical Enrichment Goats should have access to objects that they can climb. They will climb a variety of objects such as ta- bles, empty cable spools, or even elaborate jungle gyms. These structures will be used throughout the day. An enriched environment, using vehicles and tires for climbing, has been shown to increase feed consumption and reduce aggression in goats in feedlots (Flint and Murray, 2001). The provision of appropriate climbing space that is ample for the number of animals in the group may not be feasible but can prevent dominant animals from displacing subordinates. Also, climbing devices should be placed in such a manner as to prevent the goats from vaulting out of the enclosure. Goats will seclude themselves from the group when they are preparing to give birth (Ramirez et al., 1995). Providing does with the opportunity to hide, such as a wall in an indoor pen, access to an outdoor area, or bush/tall grass on pasture, may be beneficial. Be- cause many animals lie down during obstetrical pro- cedures, sufficient space should be provided to permit adequate freedom of movement. Goat kids have been found to seek hiding spaces during the week after birth in a natural and indoor setting (Lickliter, 1984). Thus, providing kids with appropriate hiding areas may be important. Nutritional Enrichment Sheep. Confined sheep can develop oral stereotypic behaviors, such as wool biting (and eating wool of other sheep; Vasseur et al., 2006; Lauber et al., 2012). Wool biting has been described as a redirected behavior, and lack of environmental stimulation and diet may contrib- ute to the onset of wool biting (Sambraus, 1985; Lynch et al., 1992). Increasing the roughage content of the diet by providing supplemental forage has been shown to reduce wool biting (Vasseur et al., 2006; Huang and Takeda, 2018), particularly when the supplemental for- age is rolled hay (Huang and Takeda, 2018). In addition to wool biting, pacing is observed in in- dividually penned sheep, predominantly immediately before feeding (Lauber et al., 2012), suggesting that it may also be related to frustrated feeding motivation. Goats. Goats are browsers and therefore eat much of their food from a level above their head. Neave et al. (2018) found that goats prefer to eat from feeders above head level compared with floor feeders; however, the preference for elevated feeders increases aggression at the feed bunk. Goats are prone to develop abnor- mal repetitive oral stereotypies. Dairy goats have been found to generally direct their abnormal oral behavior to objects in the pen, such as walls or bars (Anzuino et al., 2010). POUL TRY Social Enrichment Poultry are generally gregarious and benefit from so- cial interaction. Young birds develop food preferences through social learning (Johnston et al., 1998; Nicol, 2004), and the separation of socially housed birds causes distress (Jones and Williams, 1992). Chickens are generally tolerant of flock-mates, even when housed in large flocks, where they are unlikely to form stable social hierarchies. Ensuring that group-housed birds do not have to compete excessively for resources facilitates social tolerance and decreases the likelihood of aggres- sive interactions. Social tolerance and resource shar- ing has commonly been observed among group-housed ducks (Jones and Dawkins, 2010; Makagon et al., 2011; Rice et al., 2014). Socialization of poultry with humans can be carried out with relative ease by frequent exposure to kind, gentle care (Jones, 1996). Even brief periods of han- dling, beginning at the youngest possible age, may confer advantages for ease of later handling of birds and increase feed efficiency, body weights, and anti- body responses (Gross and Siegel, 1983). However, not all studies have linked handling to feed efficiency or body weight (Nicol, 1992). Gross and Siegel (1982) also found that positively socialized chickens had reduced responses to stressors and that resistance to most dis- eases tested was better than that of birds that had not been socialized. However, the type of handling deliv- ered matters. For example, gently lifting broiler chicks resulted in a heightened willingness of chicks to ap- proach people and reduced fear responses after stressful events, but stroking chicks did not (Nicol, 1992). Occupational and Physical Enrichment Perches and Elevated Spaces Laying Hens: Adult hens should be provided with perches or other elevated areas that encourage the use of vertical space in the enclosure. Egg-laying strains of 39 CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020chickens are highly motivated to use perches at night (Olsson and Keeling, 2002), and the majority of the flock (up to 100% of hens) will utilize perches if suf- ficient perch space is provided (Appleby et al., 1993; Olsson and Keeling, 2002). When housing hens in floor pens, perches provide them with an opportunity to seek refuge from other birds to avoid aggressive pecking (Wechsler and Huber-Eicher, 1998; Cordiner and Sa- vory, 2001). Housing hens at an early age with perches has been associated with a reduction in the prevalence of cannibalism (Gunnarsson, 1999). Perches can also minimize bird flightiness and fearfulness (Brake, 1987), and the exercise facilitated by vertical movement can improve bone strength (Whitehead, 2004). Although perches provide many benefits for the hen, they have been associated with the development of bumblefoot (a painful foot condition) and keel bone lesions (Tauson and Abrahamsson, 1994, 1996). Keel bone lesions may present as deviations or fractures of the bone (Casey-Trott et al., 2015). It is important to design perches and place them within the environ- ment in ways that promote their use in an attempt to minimize these problems. Perch space of 12 and 15 cm (4.7 and 5.9 in) per bird should be provided to light and medium hybrid hen strains, respectively (Apple- by, 1995; Struelens and Tuyttens, 2009; Hester, 2014). Perch space of at least 15 cm (5.9 in) is recommended, but may be adjusted based on bird size. For example, studies have shown that 12 and 15 cm (4.7 and 5.9 in) per bird are sufficient for light and medium hybrid hen strains, respectively (Appleby, 1995; Struelens and Tuyttens, 2009; Hester, 2014). Perches should be free of sharp edges and of a size that can be readily gripped by the claws but large enough in diameter that the bird's toenails do not damage its footpad. Perches made of softer materials are associated with a lower incidence of keel bone fractures; however, they can be more dif- ficult to disinfect than those made of PVC or metal (Sandilands et al., 2009; Struelens and Tuyttens, 2009). When multiple perch levels are provided, it is recom- mended that installation of the higher perch be at an angle no greater than 45\u00b0 relative to the one beneath it (Lambe et al., 1997; Scott et al., 1997). Alternatively, the addition of ramps can be used to assist hens with transitioning onto elevated spaces (Stratmann et al., 2015; Pettersson et al., 2017). Clearance of 19 to 24 cm (7.5 to 9.4 in) between the highest perch and cage top or ceiling is suggested (Struelens et al., 2008). Early exposure to perches during rearing facilitates perching behavior in adult birds (Faure and Bryan Jones, 1982; Heikkil\u00e4 et al., 2006) and increases bone mineral con- tent (Enneking et al., 2012). For more details about perches, refer to Chapter 12: Egg-Type Poultry . Broiler Chickens and Turkeys: The effects of elevated spaces on activity time budgets and physiological out- comes of meat-type birds are unclear. Bird strain (e.g., slow vs. fast growing), group size, and the type and number of enrichments have confounded interpretation of available research. Broiler chicks and turkey poults, and laying strains of chickens, are rarely observed perching during their first few weeks. Perching behav- ior peaks when chicks are between 3 and 6 wk of age (LeVan et al., 2000; Martrenchar et al., 2001; Enneking et al., 2012). The use of elevated spaces among broiler chicks and turkey poults declines from approximately 6 wk of age (LeVan et al., 2000; Martrenchar et al., 2001; Norring et al., 2016). Designs that facilitate access and the bird's ability to balance, such as platforms (Nor- ring et al., 2016; Bailie et al., 2018), are more often used than perches. Barrier perches (low perches that are anchored to the ground) have been associated with a greater incidence of perching compared with use of perch positioned over a stabilizing foot (Ventura et al., 2012). Straw or hay bales may be used to provide an el- evated surface for broilers and turkeys but older or less mobile birds may have trouble accessing the tops of the bales. Additionally, because these substrates can pro- mote foraging, the bales may be pecked apart and scat- tered (Martrenchar et al., 2001; Vasdal et al., 2019). Broiler Breeders: Relatively few studies have evalu- ated the effects of environmental enrichments on the welfare of broiler breeders (Estevez, 2009; Riber et al., 2017), but broiler breeders use elevated spaces when offered. The initial increased use of perches levels off or decreases as the birds increase in size and weight (Gebhardt-Henrich et al., 2017, 2018). Like that in lay- ing hens, perch use by broiler breeders is affected by perch arrangement and design (Muiruri et al., 1990; Gebhardt-Henrich et al., 2018). Perch provision may improve leg health and have positive effects on the re- productive output of broiler breeders (Rodriguez-Aur- rekoetxea et al., 2015). Its relationship with keel bone damage is unclear (Gebhardt-Henrich et al., 2017). Nests Laying Hens and Broiler Breeders: Hens should be provided with a nest site when cage space allows. Nests are an important physical enrichment for egg-laying hens and breeding flocks (Appleby et al., 1986). Egg laying involves a complex sequence of behaviors, includ- ing searching for a suitable site in which to lay an egg and then preparing that site by pecking, treading, and molding the substrate to create a nest. When provided with inadequate nest site (e.g., with intermittent or no access to nest boxes), hens display increased pacing and spend less time settled in their eventual laying posi- tion during the pre-laying period (Appleby et al., 1993; Yue and Duncan, 2003), which has been interpreted as an indication of frustration. A hen's motivation for nest use increases as the time of oviposition approaches (Cooper and Albentosa, 2003), and is not dependent on previous experience with a nest box (Cooper and Appleby, 1995). Nest boxes that offer seclusion are as- sociated with more settled pre-laying behaviors and promote nest-building behaviors (Appleby and McRae, 40 CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT Ag Guide, 4th ed. 20201986; Struelens et al., 2008) and are therefore recom- mended. See Chapter 12: Egg-Type Poultry for more information about nests. Turkeys and Waterfowl: Although it has not been evaluated, it is likely that turkey and waterfowl breed- er birds have similar motivation to lay their eggs in a nest and therefore should be provided with access to nest boxes. For ducks, the provision of highly enclosed nests can promote nest use, decreasing the number of eggs laid on the floor (Makagon et al., 2011). Turkeys have been shown to prefer nest boxes that are less well lit, at least when initially selecting a nest site (Millam, 1987). Loose Substrate Chickens and Turkeys: The provision of loose sub- strate that provides birds with dustbathing and forag- ing opportunities is recommended. If an appropriate substrate is provided, chickens (all strains) and turkeys will dustbathe in long bouts on most days. During dust- bathing, loose particles are worked through the feathers and then shaken out. This improves feather condition by dispersing lipids (van Liere, 1992). Dustbathing sub- strate has also been postulated to serve to remove ec- toparasites, although the relationship between parasite load and dustbathing behavior remains unclear (Martin and Mullens, 2012; Vezzoli et al., 2015). Chicks engage in some components of the dustbathing sequence within the first week after hatch. The full sequence of actions that make up dustbathing is visible by the second week. By 3 wk of age, most chicks engage in dustbathing be- havior that closely resembles the adult form (Larsen et al., 2000). Laying hens prefer to dustbathe in fine-particle, fri- able substrates, such as sand and peat moss, than in coarse-particle substrates, such as wood shavings or sawdust, or Astroturf (Petherick and Duncan, 1989; Alvino et al., 2013). The dispersal of feed also pro- motes dustbathing; however, it leads to accumula- tion of feather lipids (Scholz et al., 2014). Hens will perform the dustbathing behavioral sequence on wire (sham dustbathing; Appleby et al., 1993). It has been suggested that hens develop sham dustbathing when dustbathing substrate is not accessible, and continue to sham dustbathe out of habit even after a friable substrate is provided (Olsson et al., 2002). Performance of sham dustbathing behavior does not seem to satisfy the hen's motivation to dustbathe in litter (Olsson et al., 2002) or to work for access to litter for dustbathing (Wichman and Keeling, 2008). Ensuring that adequate space and substrate are provided for multiple hens to dustbathe at once can reduce the occurrence of sham dustbathing (Louton et al., 2016). Broiler chickens and turkeys typically have access to litter in which they can dustbathe. Supplementation with additional substrate is therefore not necessary. In addition to litter, access to dustbathing substrate in the form of sand, peat, oat or rice hulls, straw pellets, and clean wood shavings can stimulate dustbathing behavior of broilers to various degrees (Baxter et al., 2018a,b; Shields et al., 2004). In addition to stimulating dustbathing behavior, the provision of suitable substrate, such as friable litter material, for chickens and turkeys facilitates foraging. Increasing foraging opportunities can, in turn, help to reduce the incidence of 2 abnormal behaviors, feather pecking and cannibalism (Newberry, 2004; Rodenburg and Koene, 2004). These behaviors are not related to aggression. Feather pecking can consist of gentle peck- ing that does not result in the removal of feathers from the pecked bird or more severe pecking that results in feather loss (Savory, 1995). Having a feather removed is painful (Gentle and Hunter, 1991), and severe feather pecking can lead to birds having denuded areas that expose the skin to injury and impair thermoregulation. These denuded areas may also attract tissue pecking and cannibalism by other birds. Cannibalism involves the pecking and tearing of skin, underlying tissues, and organs. Cannibalistic pecking is most often directed toward the toes, tail, vent area, or emerging primary feathers on the wings and can cause high flock injury and mortality if birds are not beak or bill trimmed (Newberry, 2004; Riber and Mench, 2008). Once out- breaks of feather pecking and cannibalism start, they are difficult to control because the behaviors are social- ly transmitted among birds in the flock; therefore, it is best to prevent their occurrence through early interven- tion. For example, providing substrate during the early rearing period can reduce feather damage (Tahamtani et al., 2016); however, the age at which the substrate is provided and the type of substrate provided matters (Hartcher et al., 2015). Due in part to strong genetic effects (Kjaer and Hocking, 2004), these behaviors can be more difficult to control in some species or strains than in others. Waterfowl: Waterfowl maintain their plumage condi- tion by wet preening; loose substrate is not used for dustbathing. Water and friable substrates promote foraging behaviors and reduce feather pecking. How- ever, they have been ineffective in preventing cannibal- ism (Riber and Mench, 2008), which is more prevalent among Muscovy ducks than other duck strains (Gus- tafson et al., 2007a,b). Pools, Water Troughs, and Showers Waterfowl will swim and wet preen when provided with a pond or pool. In addition to enhancing behavior- al opportunities, these resources help waterfowl main- tain good plumage condition. Ducks will also wet preen using troughs and showers, and to a lesser degree using water from nipple drinkers (Jones et al., 2009). When provided, open water sources should be cleaned regu- larly to maintain cleanliness and bird health, as they may harbor bacteria (Schenk et al., 2016). If swim- ming water is made available to ducklings, it should be provided in a manner that reduces drowning risk; for example, by keeping the water level low and ensuring that the ducklings can easily come out of the water. 41 CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020Objects In addition to the effects of objects on fearfulness, providing birds with objects that promote exploratory or pecking behaviors can also reduce feather pecking or aggressive behaviors. For example, providing laying hens with empty boxes, concrete blocks, or shell at 16 wk of age reduced gentle feather-pecking behavior (Tahamtani et al., 2016). Chickens were attracted to and manipulated hanging strings (Jones, 2004), and providing these in cages was found to reduce feather damage, presumably because of reduced feather peck- ing (Jones et al., 2004). The success of provision of pecking substrates, such as hay bales or string, for broiler breeders is not as clear (Hocking and Jones, 2006). Improved feather quality was reported in Pekin ducks that were provided with environmental enrich- ment consisting of wiffle balls threaded with colored cable ties (Colton and Fraley, 2014). Duggan et al. (2014) reported no difference in injurious pecking be- tween turkeys provided with plastic balls and turkeys that did not receive plastic balls. On the other hand, Martrenchar et al. (2001) reported reduced pecking injuries in both toms and hens after providing grow- ing turkeys with straw and hanging chains. Sherwin et al. (1999) reared turkeys with a variety of pecking substrates (e.g., vegetable matter, rope, flexible plas- tic conduit, and chains) and found that this reduced injuries caused by wing and tail pecking. Taken to- gether, available evidence suggests that the success of enrichment with objects depends on the object pro- vided, timing of provision, and poultry species. Nota- bly, novel objects can themselves cause fear reactions (Murphy, 1977; Nicol, 1992). Fear reactions can be reduced by introducing novel objects when chicks are young (Jones, 1982) or rearing birds in more complex environments (Brants\u00e6ter et al., 2016). Cover and Partitions Providing floor-housed chickens with cover in the form of overhead vertical panels has been shown to improve pen usage, increase resting and preening be- haviors, and decrease the number of times that birds disturb one another (Newberry and Shackleton, 1997; Cornetto et al., 2002). Transparent panels with opaque stripes that provided 67% cover were reported to be more effective and preferred by chickens to solid, trans- parent, or less fully striped panels (Newberry and Shackleton, 1997). When provided to broiler breeders, vertical panels promoted space use of males and led to greater reproductive outputs (Leone and Estevez, 2008). Among male turkeys, visual barriers, in addition to supplemental UV light and straw, were effective at reducing injuries due to injurious pecking (Moinard et al., 2001). The provision of shelters and canopies on free-range areas has been found to increase range use by chickens (Dal Bosco et al., 2014; Gilani et al., 2014; Stadig et al., 2017) and decrease feather damage due to injurious pecking (Bright et al., 2011).Sensory Enrichment The effects of 3 forms of sensory enrichment (videos, odors, and music) on chickens have been reviewed by Jones (2004). Both chicks and hens are attracted to video images shown outside of their enclosures. Bright, colored, complex, and moving video images are more attractive to the birds than dull, still, greytone, and simple images. Regular exposure of chicks to video stimulation reduces their fear of a novel place. Fear responses in a novel environment were also found to be reduced in chicks if the environment contained an odor with which the chicks had been reared (vanillin), and the chicks showed less fear of novel food (food neopho- bia) and consumed that food sooner if it was associated with the familiar odor. Providing chickens with audi- tory enrichment in the form of classical music has also been suggested to reduce stress as indicated by lower heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratios in chicks reared with classical music compared with chicks reared without classical music; however, the effects of classical mu- sic on stress responses depend on the breed of chicken (D\u00e1vila et al., 2011). Nutritional Enrichment As discussed above, the provision of appropriate loose substrate, such as wood-shavings litter for fowl or water for ducks, facilitates foraging behavior. Other methods of increasing foraging time or frequency include plac- ing objects in water containers (for ducks) or in the feed troughs (Sherwin, 1995; Riber and Mench, 2008) or scattering feed in the litter when birds are housed on substrate. The effectiveness of scatter feeding as an environmental enrichment likely depends on bird strain and the item scattered. Although laying hens will sort for feed when also simultaneously offered a freely avail- able food source (i.e., feed in their feeders; Jensen et al., 2002), broiler chickens do so to a much lesser extent (Lindqvist et al., 2006). This decrease in willingness to peck through shavings for food is thought to reflect a shift toward energy conservation, which has accompa- nied selection for high productivity or growth. Indeed, scattering of feed and other substrates was shown to improve activity of broilers for no more than a few min- utes and only when mealworms were scattered (Pichova et al., 2016). The implications of providing scattered feed to broiler breeders are also not straightforward. Although scattering of feed reduced object pecking, it did not alleviate other indicators of hunger (de Jong et al., 2005). Scatter feeding of a high-fiber diet with a high ratio of insoluble fiber yielded more promising results but still failed to relieve all indicators of hunger (Nielsen et al., 2011). Similarly encouraging but mixed findings resulted from feeding high-fiber diets (with oat hulls, or feed-grade or appetite suppressant (San- dilands et al., 2006; Morrissey et al., 2014). 42 CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS Close monitoring is required when introducing new objects into social housing environments because ag- gression may increase if the animals compete for access to the resource. Other constraints on enrichment are related to facility design, cost, sanitation, ease of man- agement (including the amount of time and effort that caretakers must put into maintaining the enrichment program), and potential effects on research outcomes. Care must be taken to monitor the worth, effective- ness, and safety of the enrichment used. It is suggested that the use of the enrichment by the animals as well as animal behavior, health, and performance be moni- tored on a regular basis to assess the effectiveness of the enrichment program. It is also important to con- sider that animals can sustain injuries from enrichment. For example, swine, calves, and laying hens can sustain injuries if aggression and other unwanted behaviors are not managed appropriately in social housing environ- ments. Also, intestinal obstruction due to the provision of foraging enrichments or items that can be chewed or ingested (Hahn et al., 2000; Seier et al., 2005) can be harmful. The safety characteristics of potential en- richment devices should be evaluated utilizing several considerations suggested by Young (2003): Does the enrichment have sharp edges? Can the animal's limbs or other body parts be trapped in any part of the enrichment? Can the animal break or dismantle the enrich- ment, and if so, would the fragments or constitu- ent parts pose a safety risk? Can the enrichment or any part of it be gnawed and swallowed? Is the enrichment made of nontoxic material? Can disease transmission be prevented through adequate cleaning or sterilization of the enrich- ment? Could the animal use the enrichment to damage its cage- or pen-mates or its enclosure? REFERENCES AHDB. 2017. A Practical Guide to Environmental Enrichment for Pigs: A Handbook for Pig Farmers.

CHAPTER 4: ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020Handling refers to how agricultural animals are touched, moved, and interacted with during husbandry procedures and movement between pastures or housing locations. Transport involves movement of agricultural animals by vehicle or vessel from one place to another. Performance standards during handling include care- ful, safe, considerate, gentle, and calm human interac- tions with animals. Animals handled in this way will be calmer and easier to handle than animals handled in a rough or harsh manner. Outcome-based perfor- mance measurements are recommended to monitor ani- mal handling practices (Dalmau et al., 2016; Losada- Espinosa et al., 2018). This helps people maintain high standards of animal care. Handling problems that can be measured easily include the percentage of animals falling, running, turning back, vocalizing, those moved with electric prods, and mis-caught in squeeze chutes (Grandin, 1998a, 2001; Hulgren et al., et al., 2015; Simon et al., 2016; Woiwode et al., 2016). Poultry handling practices and transport can be monitored by measuring bruises and broken legs or wings (Grandin, 2015; Grilli et al., 2015; Kettelsen et al., 2015) Whenever possible, it is recommended to move ani- mals at a normal walking speed. Acclimating animals to handling and close contact with people will reduce stress (Fordyce, 1987; Boandl et al., 1989; Grandin, 1997a; Cooke et al., 2009, 2012; Kutzer et al., 2015). It is recommended that acclimation of animals with a more excitable temperament to handling facilities should be done carefully to prevent increased animal agitation and fearfulness. Sutherland and Huddart (2012) stated that acclimation of dairy heifers to the milking parlor had greater benefits for heifers with calmer tempera- ments. Research clearly shows that animals that are handled in a negative manner, such as those subjected to hitting or tail twisting, or that fear humans have reduced performance, such as lower weight gains, fewer piglets, lower milk production, or reduced egg produc- tion (Hemsworth et al., 1981, 2000; Barnett et al., 1992; Grandin and Shivley, 2015). Cattle that become agitat- ed during restraint in a squeeze chute or exit from the squeeze chute rapidly have lower weight gains, poorer meat quality, and higher cortisol levels compared with animals that are less agitated or have lower chute exit velocities (Voisinet et al., 1997a,b; Curley et al., 2006; King et al., 2006). Beef cattle handled quietly had low- er cortisol levels (Petherick et al., 2009). Training of people who handle livestock is strongly recommended. When trained handlers were compared with untrained handlers, they were more likely to avoid using negative behaviors toward animals such as shouting or hitting (Ceballos et al., 2018). They also had a more positive attitude toward livestock handling. Untrained handlers of pigs had more nonambulatory pigs arriving at a packing plant (Fitzgerald et al., 2009). Socialization of agricultural animals with humans, which is more feasible with smaller than larger numbers of animals, reduces handling stress. Socialization can be carried out with relative ease by frequent exposure to gentle care. Even brief periods of handling, beginning at the youngest possible age, confer advantages for ease of handling of birds and increase feed efficiency, body weight, and antibody responses to red blood cell anti- gens (Siegel and Honaker, 2014). For example, Gross and Siegel (1982a,b) and Jones and Hughes (1981) found that chickens positively socialized to humans had reduced responses to stressors and decreased disease compared with nonsocialized birds. When large num- bers of animals are housed under commercial condi- tions, socialization may not be possible, but flightiness can be reduced if a person walks through the flock, herd, or group of animals daily. Stroking of piglets after weaning resulted in animals that were more willing to approach people (Tallet et al., 2014). PREVENTING DISTRESS IN ANIMALS In research settings, animals should be handled and restrained using low-stress handling. Aggressive han- dling should be avoided for farm animals. Handlers should be trained to recognize signs of distress or be- haviors that may result in injury or stress to the ani- mals. Signs of distress may include kicking, struggling, or attempting to jump out of a handling facility. Vocal- izations (moos, bellows, or squeals) are often associated with aversive events such as electric prod use, slipping on the floor, or excessive pressure from a restraint de- vice (Grandin, 2001; Edwards et al., 2010; Bourguet et al., 2011). Vocalization is associated with higher physi-CHAPTER 5: ANIMAL HANDLING AND TRANSPORT 54ological measures of stress (Dunn, 1990; Warriss et al., 1994; Edwards et al., 2010; Hemsworth et al., 2011). Calm animals will also provide more accurate re- search results that are less confounded by handling stress because lactate and glucose levels will be lower (Benjamin et al., 2001; Edwards et al., 2010). Han- dling and restraint stresses can significantly alter physi- ological measurements. Beef cattle not accustomed to handling had greater cortisol levels after restraint than dairy cattle that were accustomed to handling (Lay et al., 1992a,b). Prolonged (6-h) restraint of sheep re- sulted in extremely high cortisol levels (Apple et al., 1993). Multiple shocks with an electrical prod more than doubled the levels of lactate and glucose in pigs compared with careful handling without electric prods (Brundige et al., 1998; Benjamin et al., 2001; Brandt and Aaslyng, 2015). Even moderate use of electric prods increases livestock handling stress (Edwards et al., 2010). Electric prod use in pigs is associated with higher lactate levels, higher percentages of pigs falling, and high-pitched squealing (Correa et al., 2010; Ed- wards et al., 2010). Transportation performance standards include move- ment of animals that are injured, nonambulatory, or dead (Ritter et al., 2007; Berry et al., 2012). Trans- portation should only be performed when necessary and done carefully to minimize risks of injury or death. Making the transport experience comfortable for each species should be a priority for animal handlers. Load- ing animals onto a vehicle is a critical stage when extra care is required (Goumon and Faucitano, 2017). Stress indicators, such as heart rate and blood lactate, will increase when electric prods are used (Correa et al., 2010). Research and teaching are conducted on either com- mercial farms or in facilities operated by educational institutions or commercial companies. Many of the ani- mals may not be accustomed to close contact with peo- ple, and commercial handling equipment such as cattle squeeze chutes and other specialized equipment are most appropriate. An agricultural animal may also be housed for various research or instructional purposes in other facilities, such as small indoor pens, that are not similar to commercial conditions where there is need or opportunity for greater human-animal interaction. Researchers have trained animals to cooperate with in- jections, restraint, and other procedures. For example, pigs, sheep, and other animals can be easily trained to voluntarily enter a restraint device or hold out a limb for various procedures (Panepinto, 1983; Hutson 1985; Schapiro et al., 2005; Graham et al., 2012). Hutson (1985) reported that providing food rewards to sheep made them more willing to move through a handling facility in the future. Training animals to co- operate improves welfare and removes some effects of restraint stress on physiological data.FLIGHT ZONE AND BEHAVIOR PRINCIPLES People who handle cattle, bison, sheep, horses, and other grazing animals should have knowledge of flight zone principles (Grandin, 1987, 2017; Smith, 1998; Cote, 2003; Figure 1). Flight zone principles also work effectively with pigs. The flight zone concept does not apply to animals that are trained to lead with a halter or otherwise conditioned to close human handling. The flight zone varies depending on whether cattle or other livestock have been extensively or intensively raised. Extensively raised cattle may have flight zones up to 50 m (164 ft), but intensively raised cattle (e.g., those raised in a feedlot) may have flight zones only 2 to 8 m (6.6 to 26.2 ft; Grandin, 1989b, 2014a). The size of an alley can change flight zones. Sheep in a 2-m-wide (6-ft-wide) alley had a smaller flight zone than sheep in a 4-m-wide (13.5-ft-wide) alley (Hutson, 1982). An approximation of the flight zone can be made by approaching the animal and noting at what distance the animal moves away. For example, when the han- dler is outside the flight zone, cattle will turn and face the handler. Flight zones can be used by handlers to move cattle and other livestock efficiently and quietly. To move a single animal forward, the handler positions themself at the edge of the flight zone and behind the point of balance (located at the shoulder). A common mistake made by many handlers when an animal is con- fined in a single file chute is to stand in front of the shoulder and attempt to make an animal go forward by poking its rear. This gives the animal conflicting sig- nals. To move the animal forward, the handler stands behind the point of balance (Kilgour and Dalton, 1984; Grandin, 1987, 2017). Figure 1 presents the concept of flight zone and point of balance. Figure 2 shows how to move an animal forward in a single file chute by walk- ing quickly past the point of balance at the shoulder in the opposite direction of desired movement (Grandin, 1998b, 2017; Grandin and Deesing, 2008). To induce cattle to stop or back up, handlers position themselves ahead of the point of balance. Too deep a penetration of the flight zone may cause extensively raised cattle to bolt or run away or rear up in a chute. Animals con- fined in a single file chute will often stop rearing if the handler backs up and gets out of the flight zone. Extensively raised grazing animals that arrive at a research facility may have a large flight zone. This is more likely to occur if they have been handled exclu- sively by people on horseback. The person on foot is perceived as something novel and frightening (Grandin and Deesing, 2008). Animal learning is specific: habitu- ating a horse to a blue and white umbrella does not transfer to an orange tarp (Leiner and Fendt, 2011). The size of the flight zone will gradually diminish if the animals are handled calmly and have frequent contact with people.55 CHAPTER 5: ANIMAL HANDLING AND TRANSPORT Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020Farm animals are social, and a lone animal separated from its herd-mates often becomes severely agitated and more difficult to handle. Many injuries to both people and animals occur when a single lone animal runs into a fence or charges. An agitated lone animal can be calmed by putting other animals with it. Cattle and sheep will follow a leader (Arnold, 1977; Dumont et al., 2005). When one of the animals starts to move, the others will follow. Natural following behavior can be used to facilitate calm movement of animals. If animals are calmly moving in the desired direction, the han- dler backs up and stops putting pressure on the flight Figure 1.

Handler movement pattern to induce cattle to move forward in a race. Reproduced with permission of T. Grandin.56 CHAPTER 5: ANIMAL HANDLING AND TRANSPORT Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020zone. Continuous pressure on the flight zone may cause animals to start running, which is undesirable. Cattle, pigs, and goats will move more easily into a single file chute if the crowd pen that leads up to it is only half full. Wait until there is space in the single file chute before refilling the crowd pen. This will enable the han- dler to use an animal's following behavior. AIDS FOR MOVING ANIMALS Handlers should be trained in the proper use of each driving aid, which should be appropriate to the spe- cies. Animals in properly designed and well-maintained facilities may be moved by skilled handlers using their natural behavior without the use of aids. Both the handlers and the facility should be evaluated (NCBA, 2019). When necessary, nonelectrical driving aids such as paddles, flags, and panels (sort boards) may be an adjunct to the use of natural behavior and handling skills. One study with pigs showed that panels (sort boards) and large flags were most efficient compared with electric prods (McGlone et al., 2004). An electric prod should only be used in the specific situation when it is needed and then put away. Some examples of specific situations where an electric prod may need to be used are given in the list below. In all other situations, electric prods should not be used dur- ing teaching and research. When an electric prod needs to be used, it should be applied to the hindquarters of the animal. It must never be applied to sensitive areas of an animal such as the eyes, ears, genitals, ud- der, or anus (NAMI, 2019; NCBA, 2019; OIE, 2019). Electric prods must not be used on newborn, young, or nonambulatory animals. Handlers have a better at- titude toward animals when electric prods are not used (Coleman et al., 2003). Data collected at meat plants indicate that most cattle and pigs could be moved throughout an entire handling system without electric prods (Grandin, 2005). Data collected at beef feedlots indicated that the average percentage of cattle moved with an electric prod was 4% or less (Barnhardt et al., 2015; Woiwode et al., 2016). Usually 1 to 2 brief shocks are needed. In pigs, electric prod use should be limited to 2 brief (1-second) shocks (Ritter et al., 2009b). If the animal does not respond, the use of the electric prod should be discontinued immediately. Battery-operated prods are recommended because they administer a lo- calized shock between 2 prongs. Some examples of the use of an electric prod as a last resort or if human or animal safety is in jeopardy are listed below: 1. To move an animal after repeated attempts with nonelectrified driving aids such as a pig panel (sort board), a plastic bag on the end of a stick, flags, slappers, rattle paddles, or streamers tied to the end of a stick have failed. In this situation, the use of an electric prod is preferable to beat- ing, dragging, pushing, or hard tail twisting of animals. Smaller animals may be gently lifted or rolled onto a transport mechanism. Sheep must never be picked up by the wool because severe bruising will result. 2. To get a downed (fallen) animal up when it is in a truck located at a truck stop or on the side of a highway. In this situation, opening up the truck gates or unloading the animals is not possible. 3. To move an animal that is choking in a head stanchion or head gate or has become jammed in a chute or other equipment. In this situation, the electric prod is used to make the animal im- mediately stand up. This is essential to prevent death from pressure on the throat area or serious injury. Large tame animals, such as cattle, can sometimes become dangerous if they push and shove around peo- ple during feeding or moving through a gate. Pushy an- imals can often be trained to stop pushy behavior if the person waits for them to stand still for a few seconds before putting out the feed or opening the gate. This will reward calm behavior (Grandin, 2017). Sometimes the handler may have to tell the animals to \"get back\" in a stern voice. Animal Perception Hearing. All species have sensitive hearing. Cat- tle and horses have hearing that is more sensitive to high-pitched sounds than humans (Heffner and Heff- ner, 1983). The human ear is most sensitive at 1,000 to 3,000 Hz and cattle are most sensitive at 8,000 Hz (Ames, 1974; Heffner and Heffner, 1983). Handlers should not yell or shout at cattle because shouting may be just as aversive as an electric prod (Pajor et al., 2003). In one experiment, the sounds of people yelling caused a greater increase in heart rate than the sounds of gates clanging (Waynert et al., 1999). Normal talking will have no effect but yelling is stressful (Hemsworth et al., 2011). Intermittent or high-pitched sounds caused greater behavioral reactions and increased heart rate in pigs compared with steady or low-pitched sounds (Talling et al., 1998). Intermittent sounds and rapid movements are also more likely to cause cattle to react (Lanier et al., 2000). Good handlers are observant of the position of an animal's ears. Horses and cattle will point their ears directly toward things that attract their attention (Grandin, 2014a, 2017). Vision. Cattle, sheep, and horses have wide-angle vision and they can see all around themselves with- out turning their heads (Prince, 1970; Hutson, 1980; Kilgour and Dalton, 1984; Adamczyk, et al., 2015). Grazing animals have depth perception when they are standing still with their heads down (Lemmon and Pat- terson, 1964). Depth perception is probably poor when the animals are moving with their heads up, which ex-57 CHAPTER 5: ANIMAL HANDLING AND TRANSPORT Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020plains why they stop and put their heads down when they see a shadow on the floor. Grazing animals have a horizontal band-shaped area on the retina that is most sensitive to visual stimuli (Shinozaki et al., 2010). This enables them to scan the horizon while grazing. Grazing animals are dichromatic (i.e., have 2 cone- cell types in the retina to mediate color vision). The retinas of cattle, sheep, and goats are most sensitive to bluish-purple light (444-455 nm) and yellowish-green light (552-555 nm; Jacobs et al., 1998). The dichro- matic vision of the horse is most sensitive at 428 and 539 nm (Carroll et al., 2001). Pigs have difficulty dis- criminating red from gray (Eguchi et al., 1997). Chickens and turkeys possess 4 cone-cell types in the retina, giving them tetrachromatic color vision, com- pared with the human trichromatic vision based on 3 cone-cell types (Lewis and Morris, 2000). Moreover, the spectral sensitivity of chickens is greater than that of humans from 320 to 480 nm and 580 to 700 nm. Their maximum sensitivity is in a similar range (545-575 nm) to that of humans (Prescott and Wathes, 1999). Birds can see UV light that humans cannot see (Tsukahara et al., 2014).The broader spectral sensitivity of poul- try may make them perceive many light sources as be- ing brighter than a human would see. As birds grow, eye sensitivity to UV light may decrease (Olsson et al., 2016). Poultry may be more docile during handling in blue light spectra (Lewis and Morris, 2000). Lighting conditions have a large effect on chicken behavior when the birds are shackled for slaughter (Jones et al., 1998); they struggle less under dim lighting. During handling of poultry, the occurrence of flapping should be mini- mized. Changes in lighting may be used as one tool to keep birds calmer during handling. Effects of Visual Distractions and Handling Livestock of all species will often refuse to move through a chute or other handling facility if they see distractions such as shadows, reflections, or people ahead of them. Removing distractions that cause ani- mals to balk and stop will facilitate animal movement (Kilgour and Dalton, 2014a, 2017). A calm animal will stand and point its eyes and ears toward distractions that attract its attention. If the leader is allowed to stop and look at a distraction, it will often move forward and the other animals will follow. If the animals are rushed, they may turn back and refuse to move forward when they see a distraction. Distractions are most likely to cause balking or other handling prob- lems if the animals are not familiar with the facility. Experienced dairy cows will often ignore a distraction such as a floor drain, but new, inexperienced heifers will balk at it. Table 5-1 contains a list of distractions that may cause animals to balk and refuse to move. This list can be used as a guide for modifying handling facilities where excessive use of electric prods is occurring or animals repeatedly balk and refuse to move forward. In facilities where animals move easily and quietly and electric prods are seldom used, removal of distractions may not be needed. Animal behavior should be care- fully examined to determine whether the facility needs to be modified. A modification such as adding a solid side or changing lighting should be temporarily tested to determine whether it improves livestock flow. Facility Design Principles for All Species Flooring. For all mammals, nonslip flooring is es- 2014a; Albright, 1995; Grand- in and Deesing, 2008). Animals often become agitated when they start slipping. Handling and restraint will be safer and animals will remain calm if animals have nonslip flooring (e.g., grooved concrete, rubber mats, or metal rod grids). Handling facilities must have non- slip floors and good drainage. Problems with slippery flooring in livestock and horses can be detected by measuring slips and falls. If more than 1% of the ani- mals fall during handling, a problem exists that must be corrected (Grandin, 2005). Three surveys of cattle handling on ranches and feedlots indicated that falling during exiting from the squeeze chute was under 1% (Barnhardt et al., 2015; Simon et al., 2016; Woiwode et al., 2016). Equipment Maintenance. Surfaces that contact the animals such as fences, gates, and restraint devices should be designed with animals in mind. Sharp edges cause bruises (Grandin, 1980c) and injury. Managers should routinely inspect equipment, including latches on restraint devices, and have a program of regular maintenance based on use. Table 5-1. Visual distractions that may cause livestock to balk and refuse to move1 Sudden changes in floor structure or surface such as drain grates, objects on the floor, or change in flooring material. Shadows, puddles, and shafts of light; seeing light through a slatted floor. Animals may refuse to enter a dark place. Use indirect lighting to facilitate movement toward the light. Animals tend to move from a darker place to a more brightly illuminated place, but they will not move into blinding light. Reflections on a wet floor or shiny metal. Move lights to eliminate the reflection or use nonreflective surfaces. Moving people in front of approaching animals. It is best if people stand where approaching animals do not see them. Jiggling chains, coats on a fence, flapping plastic, or swinging ropes. Remove these distractions. Animals see people, moving objects such as vehicles, or objects with high color contrasts outside of the chute. Improve movement by installing solid sides. 1This table is adapted from information in Kilgour (1971), Lynch and Alexander (1973), Hutson (1981), Grandin (1980a,b, 1996), van Putten and Elshof (1978), Kilgour and Dalton (1984), Tanida et al. (1996), Grandin and Johnson (2005), Grandin and Deesing (2008), and Grandin (2017).58 CHAPTER 5: ANIMAL HANDLING AND TRANSPORT Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF RESTRAINT AND HANDLING Proper training of animal care personnel in handling procedures includes consideration of both animal and handler well-being. During the handling and restraint of animals, care is exercised to prevent injury to ani- mals or personnel and to handle animals quietly. Prop- erly designed and maintained facilities operated by trained personnel greatly facilitate efficient movement of animals. Prolonged restraint of any animal should be avoid- ed unless such restraint is essential to the research or teaching objectives. Electrical immobilization must not be used as a method of restraint; it is highly aversive to cattle Electri- cal immobilization is a completely different technology from, and not to be confused with, electric prods or electrical stunning equipment that is used to induce instantaneous unconsciousness before slaughter. The following are important guidelines for the use of animal restraint equipment: Animals to be placed in restraint equipment, such as a squeeze chute, head gate, or sling, should be conditioned to such equipment before initiation of the project, unless the preconditioning itself would increase the stress to the animals or alter the objectives of the teaching or research. The period of restraint should be the minimum required to accomplish the research or teaching objectives. Restraint devices are not to be considered nor- mal methods of housing, although they may be required for specific research and teaching objec- tives. Attention should be paid to the possible develop- ment of lesions or illness associated with restraint, including contusions, knee or hock abrasions, de- cubital ulcers, dependent edema, and weight loss. Provide health care if these or other serious prob- lems occur; if necessary, remove the animal either temporarily or permanently from the restraint device. Some aggressive behaviors of larger farm animals pose a risk to the health and well-being of both herd- mates and human handlers. These behaviors may be modified or their impact reduced by use of several ac- ceptable restraint devices (e.g., hobbles, squeeze chutes, and stanchions) and practices. Use only the minimum restraint necessary to control the animal and to en- sure the safety of attendants. Handling and restraint is best done in facilities and using equipment appropriate for the species, animal temperament, and procedure. For example, horses, cattle, sheep, and goats that are trained to lead may be easily restrained with a halter for procedures such as injections. In contrast, facilities such as head gates, single file chutes (races), and other equipment designed for the species may be necessary for livestock with large flight zones that are not accli- mated to close contact with people. This will help avoid injuries to both people and livestock. The following guidance is provided to prevent behav- ioral agitation during restraint for all species: Nonslip flooring must be provided (Grandin, 1990; Albright, 1995). Repeated small, rapid slips may cause agitation. Avoid sudden jerky motions of either people or equipment. Smooth movements will keep animals calmer (Grandin, 1992). When an animal is raised off the ground during restraint, it will usually remain calmer if its body is fully supported. Even pressure over a wide area of the body has a calming effect (Ewbank, 1968). The Panepinto sling for small pigs and cattle squeeze chutes uses this principle (Panepinto, 1983; Grandin, 2014a). A calm, confident tone of voice will help keep live- stock calmer. Use optimum pressure\u2014not too loose and not too tight. An animal needs to be held tight enough to feel restraint but not so tight that it feels discom- fort or pain. Excessive pressure will cause strug- gling (Grandin, 1992). Blocking vision: using a blindfold made from a completely opaque material will often keep cattle and horses with a large flight zone calmer when they are restrained (Mitchell et al., 2004). Solid sides on cattle restraining chutes or a fully en- closed dark box have a calming effect (Grandin, 1980a,b, 1992; Pollard and Littlejohn, 1994; M\u00fcl- ler et al., 2008). The solid side is especially im- portant when a handler has to stand inside the animal's flight zone to either operate the restraint device or administer a procedure. GUIDELINES FOR EACH SPECIES Beef Cattle Animals that are extensively raised and have large flight zones may become agitated if people stand close to the chutes and pens in the handling facility. If this occurs, solid fences may need to be installed so that an- imals do not see people who otherwise would be deep in their flight zone. In handling chutes with open-barred sides, handlers standing outside the animal's flight zone will prevent cattle from becoming agitated. When they need to move an animal, the handler can step forward into the flight zone to make it move. After it has moved, the handler can back up and retreat from the flight zone. Signs of behavioral agitation in cattle include restless movements, tail switching, defecation, and vis- ible eye white (Sandem 2009; Grandin, 2014a, 2017). Cattle that are frequently 59 CHAPTER 5: ANIMAL HANDLING AND TRANSPORT Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020moved between pastures will become calmer (Ceballos et al., 2018). Further information on facility design is given in Grandin (1990, 1997b, 2014b) and Grandin and Deesing (2008). There are many different designs of restraining (squeeze) chutes. Well-designed squeeze chutes permit all animals to stand in a balanced position. The best squeeze chutes have squeeze sides that are applied even- ly from both sides. Squeeze chutes may be manual or hydraulic. Settings of pressure relief valves for hydrau- lic restraint chutes should be adjusted to prevent ex- cessive pressure from being applied (Grandin, 1989b). Well-designed chutes automatically stop squeezing at a reasonable pressure even if the operator continues to pull on the squeeze lever. A separate pressure control is required on chutes that have a hydraulic device for restraining the head. To avoid animal injury, this de- vice is set at a lighter pressure than other parts of the chute. Applying pressure slowly will avoid exciting the animal. Excessive pressure can cause injury and incite cattle to fight the restraint. If cattle bellow the moment that pressure is applied by a hydraulic device, this is an indicator of excessive pressure (Grandin, 2001; Bour- guet et al., 2011). Bellowing during restraint is associ- ated with higher cortisol levels (Dunn, 1990). Another outcome to watch for is that cattle should be able to breathe normally during restraint. In 2 feedlot surveys, the average percentage of cattle vocalizing in hydraulic squeeze chutes was 1.4% (Woiwode et al., 2016) and 0.9% (Barnhardt et al., 2015). On ranches, the percent- age of cattle vocalizing in a squeeze chute was 14.5% (Simon et al., 2016). The greater percentage of cattle vocalizing on ranches may have been due to use of hy- draulic chutes that were not properly adjusted. The re- duced vocalization of cattle being processed in feedlots may be due to managers being more aware of good cat- tle handling procedures. The results of the ranch study clearly show the importance of proper adjustment of the pressure control to prevent excessive force being used in restraint. Excessive pressure by a restraint de- vice will increase the percentage of cattle that vocalize (Grandin, 2001; Bourguet et al., 2011). The head gate can be self-catching or manually operated. Self-catching head gates are generally not recommended for use with horned cattle unless they are operated manually. Very young or tame calves restrained for routine procedures can be handled by means of a calf chute equipped with a calf cradle or a halter. Roping of cattle is necessary under certain condi- tions (e.g., in pastures when an animal needs treatment and no restraining facility is conveniently available). However, roping should be performed by trained and experienced personnel and in a manner that minimizes stress to both the individual and the total herd. For head restraint of cattle in a squeeze chute, a properly fitted rope halter is recommended. Nose tongs may be used on fractious animals in conjunction with other means of cattle restraint (e.g., squeeze chute), but nose tongs can slip and tear out of the nose, causing injury to the animal and possible harm to personnel from the suddenly unrestrained animal, and therefore should not be used as the sole method of restraint. Plastic streamers or a grocery bag tied to the end of a stick is an effective device for moving cattle and chang- ing their direction (Grandin, 2014a, 2017). Cattle 1961; Grandin, 1993; Curley et al., 2006). It is important for handlers to understand that certain animals may become agitated more easily than others. Dairy Cattle Mature milking dairy cows can be handled in head stanchions or a management rail (Albright and Fulwid- er, 2007). A complete squeeze chute is not required for most procedures. For foot trimming, either a squeeze chute or a specialized foot trimming chute is recom- mended. Diagrams and pictures in Sheldon et al. (2016) and Beaver and Hoglund (2015) illustrate methods for restraining tame dairy cows when they are held in a head stanchion. Young dairy heifers that are not accus- tomed to close contact with people are often handled most efficiently and safely in beef-type facilities with a squeeze chute. Dairy animals are able to discriminate between peo- ple who have handled them in a negative manner and people who handled them in a positive manner (de Pas- sill\u00e9 et al., 1996). They were most likely to avoid the negative handler when he was seen in the same location where the aversive events occurred. Dairy herds that had cows that were more willing to approach people had lower somatic cell counts (Fulwider et al., 2008). Stockmanship training and positive human interactions are associated with higher milk production and ani- mals that are calmer during milking (Hemsworth et al., 2002; Bertenshaw et al., 2008; Sorge et al., 2014). Dairy bulls are usually more dangerous than beef bulls. Bull attacks are a major cause of fatalities when people are working with livestock. One of the reasons beef bulls are safer is that they are reared in a social group or nursed and raised with a mother cow. Price and Wallach (1990) found that beef bulls attacked more often when they were raised in individual pens. A dairy bull calf raised to maturity alone in a pen is more likely to be dangerous than a bull that is always kept with other animals. Bulls that are kept in groups with other cattle are less likely to perceive people as rivals. If a bull is going to become dangerous, he is most likely to show aggression toward people at 18 to 24 mo. It is recommended that handlers learn to recognize signs of aggression that precede an attack such as the broadside threat. The bull will turn sideways to show how big he is before he attacks. Good descriptions are in Albright and Arave (1997), Albright and Fulwider (2007), and Grandin (2017). Neonatal dairy calves should be supported by the body either in both arms or placed in a wheelbarrow or special cart when being moved (Clark et al., undated). 60 CHAPTER 5: ANIMAL HANDLING AND TRANSPORT Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020They must never be dragged by the legs, head, tail, or other body part nor thrown (Botheras, undated). Horses Teaching and research horses are usually handled using halters and lead ropes, and extra control may be achieved by using the chain of a lead shank placed over the horse's nose. Only trained horses should be tied and only to solid objects that will not give way if the horse pulls back. Lead ropes attached to the halter should be tied with quick-release knot. Horses should never be tied with a chain looped across the top of the nose. Cross-ties attached to each side of the halter should be equipped with panic snaps or safety releases. A twitch may be applied to the horse's upper lip as a short-term restraint procedure (Sheldon et al., 2016). The movement of a horse may be restrained in stocks and chutes. An equine stock or chute may be as simple as a rectangular structure with a nonslip floor. Other methods of restraint that may be applied by experi- enced individuals include front foot hobbles, sideline or breeding hobbles, or leg straps, but use of these should be carefully considered depending on the training of the individual horse and the degree of restraint necessary. Chemical restraint can be effective and should be ad- ministered by a qualified person. With some drugs, an apparently sedated horse may react suddenly and force- fully to painful stimuli (Tobin, 1981). General or local anesthesia should be administered by a qualified per- son, preferably a veterinarian, for painful procedures such as castration. Swine Snaring by the nose is a common method for hold- ing swine for blood testing and other procedures. Good descriptions are given in Battaglia (1998) and Sheldon et al. (2016). Snaring is more stressful for pigs than restraint with sort boards or panels (Buzzard et al., 2012). Squealing in pigs during handling is associated with physiological measures of stress (Warriss et al., 1994; Edwards et al., 2010; Brandt and Aaslyng, 2015). Pigs will attempt to avoid the snare after they have ex- perienced snaring. Small pigs can be trained to enter a Panepinto sling (Panepinto, 1983). The pig is fully sup- ported in the sling, and its legs protrude out through leg holes. For pigs used in biomedical research, the Panepinto sling or a similar device is recommended for blood sampling from the jugular vein. The use of snares should be avoided for most procedures. Snares should be reserved for situations where there is a concern for human safety. A panel (sort board) is the best device for moving pigs (McGlone et al., 2004). Nonelectric driving aids such as panels, cattle paddles, and flags should be used by properly trained people. Guidelines on electric prod use are in the section on driving aids. Previous experience with handling and the amount of contact with people will affect the ease of pig move- ment. Pigs with previous experiences of being calmly moved may be easier to move in the future (Abbott et al., 1997; Geverink et al., 1998). Calm, nonthreatening movements of people will reduce stress levels in pigs and make them more willing to approach people (Hem- sworth et al., 1986). Pigs may be reluctant to move through facilities that are novel (Lewis et al., 2008; McGlone et al., are being moved through al- leys that are 1 m (3 ft) wide, the recommended group size is 4 (Berry et al., 2012). Pigs will usually walk over floor surfaces they are familiar with. They will be more willing to walk across a concrete floor if they are allowed to first explore it. When a young pig has to be isolated for a research procedure, the presence of one of its littermates may reduce stress. Kanitz et al. (2014) found that a familiar conspecific reduced the stress response more than a strange pig. Sheep and Goats Sheep show strong flocking behavior in pens as well as on pasture. Good stockmanship is essential. If sheep are handled roughly by one person, then they may be- come fearful of all people (Destrez et al., 2013). Breed, stocking rate, topography, vegetation, shelter, and dis- tance to water may influence flocking behaviors. Isola- tion of individual sheep or goats usually brings about signs of anxiety. Sheep that tend to bunch tightly are also more likely to vocalize when they are separated from the flock (Ligout et al., 2011). If a sheep must be isolated, it will be less stressed if it can see another sheep within 2 m (Yates et al., 2010). Separation from the flock, herd, or social companions is an important factor that causes sheep and goats to try to escape. Sheep tend to follow one another even in activities such as grazing, bedding down, reacting to obstacles, and feeding (Hutson, 2014). When handling sheep, these characteristic behaviors should be considered and used advantageously in the interest of the animals' health and welfare. Scoring of vocalization during handling and restraint does not work in sheep. Sheep vocalize when they are isolated but they seldom vocalize when they are restrained or handled. Sheep can be easily trained to enter a squeeze tilt ta- ble (Grandin, 1989a). The Panepinto sling can also be used for sheep. Some restraint devices are more aversive than others. Well-designed restrainers support the ani- mal's body and do not have sharp pressure points. Both sheep and goats can be easily trained to enter head stanchions. Sheldon et al. (2016) and Battaglia (1998) have illustrated guides on manual methods for holding sheep and goats. Designs for sheep races and corrals can be found in Barber and Freeman (2014), Ameri- can Sheep Industry Association (2016), and Grandin (2017).61 CHAPTER 5: ANIMAL HANDLING AND TRANSPORT Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020There are some behavior differences between sheep and goats when they are being moved. Due to their intense following behavior, sheep can be moved in large groups when they are handled through a chute. When one sheep starts moving through the chute, the others will follow. Goats should be brought up to the crowd pen in small separate bunches. Goats can be handled in most facilities that are designed for sheep. Surfaces must be smooth, and crevices where horns can become caught may need to be blocked. Goats are very sensitive to how people treat them. They respond well to positive daily contact with people (Miranda de la Lama and Mattiello, 2010). When they have positive interactions, they will be more willing to approach people (Battini et al., 2016; Mersmann et al., 2016). Compared with sheep, goats will spend more time close to people (Price and Thos, 1980). When a goat has its tail in the up position, its inter- action with people is more likely to be positive (Briefer et al., 2015). Goats react by vocalizing, trotting, and rearing when a single goat is separated from the flock (Carbonaro et al., 1992; Siebert et al., 2011; Patt et al., 2013). If a goat has to be housed singly for a research procedure, it should be able to hear and see its flock- mates (Patt et al., 2013) unless research and teaching protocols prohibit it. Separation of goats in a pen ad- jacent to other goats was less stressful than total isola- tion in a separate building (Siebert et al., 2011). Poultry Poultry are handled in many experimental and teach- ing situations. Examples include wing- or leg-banding, immunization by intramuscular and subcutaneous in- jections, intranasal or intraocular application of drops and wing-web puncture, and removing or placing birds in different groups, cages, or holding and transporta- tion crates. Injured, diseased, or nonambulatory birds should be euthanized on the farm and not transported. People handling birds should be trained so that stress to birds is minimal. Poultry that are not familiarized to humans tend to struggle vigorously when caught. They can easily be injured if grasped improperly or subjected to exces- sive force. All poultry tend to flap their wings when caught, inverted, or caused to struggle for balance or footing. This tendency leads to the risk of joint disloca- tion, bone fracture, or bruises when wings strike objects or other birds. The risk is particularly great for mod- ern varieties of market-weight meat-type birds, which have powerful breast muscles but relatively weak joints due to their youth, or for caged light hybrid (White Leghorn) laying hens, which have fragile wing bones. Poultry should be handled in ways that minimize wing flapping or its harmful consequences. Care should be taken to prevent birds from striking their wings on door edges when placing them into or pulling them from cages or compartments. Particular care is needed when handling caged laying hens, which are prone to osteo- porosis (Rennie et al., 1997; Webster, 2004; Stratmann et al., 2016). To minimize the risk of bone fracture, egg-type laying hens should be held by both legs when removing them from the cage (Gregory and Wilkins, 1989; Gregory et al., 1993). Another good method for removing a hen from a cage is to place one hand over her wings and use the other hand to support her body. She is then removed from the cage without holding her legs. The manner in which a bird is carried can affect its fearfulness and stress. Broilers carried even briefly in the inverted position by the legs show a greater cor- ticosterone response than do birds carried in an upright position, and the response lasts for about 3 h (Kannan and Mench, 1996). Therefore, birds should be carried upright whenever possible. Birds struggle less if they have been socialized, the body is fully supported in an upright position with wings restrained, the environ- ment is relatively quiet, and the lighting is subdued. Poultry should not be picked up or moved by one wing unless the wing is grasped near the base of the wing close to the body. They should quickly be released from such a hold, as when transferring birds from a coop to a floor pen. They should be shifted to a hold that firmly grasps both wings at their bases or that supports the body to minimize struggle and chance of a limb injury. Ducks should not be caught by the leg be- cause they are prone to leg injury (Lister et al., 2013). It is acceptable to briefly lift ducks by the base of the neck (Lister et al., 2013). Large, strong birds such as turkey toms can be dif- ficult to control by grasping a limb. They can also de- liver punishing blows with their wings when struggling against capture. To pick up a very large turkey such as a breeder tom, grasp one wing near the base of the body and then grasp the leg on the opposite side and set the bird's breast on the floor. Finally, proceed with restraining the bird by grasping both legs. For inter- mediate-sized turkeys, the base of the wing and both legs can be grasped simultaneously while lifting the tur- key off the floor. Turkeys and ducks can be driven, so catching and handling of individual birds can be mini- mized by judicious use of alleys, ramps, and driving techniques when flocks must be relocated. Appropriate driving aids are flags and plastic bags. They should be used to gently move the birds; vigorous waving of these aids should be avoided. However, some birds such as older turkeys will not walk on unfamiliar surfaces and therefore may have to be moved by individual handling. In many experimental and teaching situations, new- ly hatched birds or relatively small numbers of older birds need to be handled. In those cases, individuals can be easily caught and manipulated. Examples in- cluded wing- or leg-banding; immunization by intra- nasal or intraocular application of drops and wing-web puncture; and removing or placing birds in different groups, cages, and holding crates. Trained and experi- enced scientists and caretakers know that birds struggle 62 CHAPTER 5: ANIMAL HANDLING AND TRANSPORT Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020less if they have been socialized, if the environment is relatively quiet, and if the body is fully supported in an upright position. More complex procedures\u2014for example, obtaining blood, intraperitoneal and venous puncture, or artificial insemination\u2014often require 2 people. Skilled operators should train personnel in such handling procedures so that stress to birds is minimal. Particular care should be exercised in handling caged layers to minimize the risk of bone fractures (Gregory and Wilkins, 1989). When large numbers of birds housed under commer- cial conditions are to be moved or treated, handling methods need to be compatible with the housing sys- tems involved (Weeks, 2014). A source of concern is the manner in which birds are caught, carried, and placed in new quarters or crates. Birds are at risk of injury if they are caught and placed in a transport container by grasping a single wing with subsequent exertion of excessive force in moving the bird. Picking up birds by a single wing, if necessary, requires care, as described above. On commercial broiler farms, chickens are usu- ally picked up by a single leg and carried several birds per hand. Leg injury can be prevented if the birds are not handled roughly and carried only a short distance to the transport cage. TRANSPORT The transport of livestock involves a complex series of components, including handling, loading and un- loading, unfamiliar environments, and, in some cases, isolation and social disruption. Other variables include vehicle vibration, fluctuations in environmental temper- ature and humidity, exposure to pollutants (e.g., truck exhaust), feed and water deprivation, and other fac- tors. Hence, it is often difficult to determine with preci- sion which component or combination of components is most responsible for transportation stress. Therefore, it becomes important to pay attention to all components and the potential for cumulative effects on the well- being of the animals to be transported. Animals that are in poor condition may further deteriorate when transported (Stojkov et al., 2020). Transport to live- stock markets should be avoided for all weak or injured animals. In-depth reviews and research on transport for each species of livestock have been published for cattle (Eldridge et al., 1988; Tarrant et al., 2012; et al., 2013), sheep (Cockram et al., 1996; et al., 1998; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2012; Schwartz- al., 2012), et al., 1998; Warriss, 1998; Whiting and Brandt, 2002; Ritter et al., 2006, 2007, 2009a,b; Sutherland et al., 2009; Kephart et al., 2014; Xiong et al., 2015), poultry (Mitchell and Kettlewell, 1998, 2009; Knezacek et al., 2010; Burl- inguette 1999; Whiting, 1999; Friend, 2000a,b; Haley et al., 2008; Fitzgerald et al., 2009; Padalino, 2015). In addition, the National Research Council (2006) recom- mendations (Guidelines for the Humane Transportation of Research Animals, also known as the ILAR Trans- portation Guide) for the transport of research animals includes space requirements during transport that are consistent with this guide. In the absence of data sup- porting specific space requirements of farm animals dur- ing transport, formulae from the ILAR Transportation Guide (National Research Council, 2006) may be useful in determining space allowances during transport. The minimum areas per animal for cattle, pigs, and sheep of different weights when shipped in groups are given in Table 5-2. For poultry, the recommended minimum area will allow all birds to lie down at the same time without being on top of each other. The recommended space requirements will vary depending on tempera- ture. In extreme cold conditions, broiler chickens had increased death losses if they were stocked too loosely (Caffrey et al., 2017; Cockram and Dulal, 2018). Dur- ing hot conditions, providing additional space to help keep birds cool is recommended. The safety and comfort of the animal should be pri- mary concerns in the transportation of any animal or bird. Nonambulatory or weak, debilitated animals or poultry must not be loaded or transported unless nec- essary for medical attention. Animals that are near- ing the time of parturition should not be transported (OIE, 2019). An exception to this is when moving an animal a short distance by trained personnel to a site to give birth. Nonambulatory animals or poultry in re- search and teaching facilities must be euthanized using approved procedures unless they are receiving medical treatment (see Chapter 2: Agricultural Animal Health Care and the species-specific chapters) before removal from the facility (Grandin, 2015; AVMA, 2016, 2020). Nonambulatory poultry or other small animals such as piglets can be carried by a person or placed in a container to be moved to a euthanasia station. Cattle, pigs, or other large animals that become nonambula- tory must not be dragged (AVMA, 2016, 2020). If young or newborn calves are to be transported, in- dividual care and colostrum should be provided within 6 h after birth (National Dairy Farm Program, 2020). Calves should have a dry hair coat, dry navel cord, and be able to walk easily without assistance before being transported to auctions, livestock markets, as- sembly yards, or slaughter plants. In all species, weak newborns, emaciated animals, animals with severe inju- ries, or animals that have great difficulty walking must never be transported to livestock auctions or markets. Transportation of sheep and goats should take into consideration the climatic conditions and productive stage of the animals (e.g., late pregnancy or dams with young offspring). Care should be exercised in the trans- port of animals, and special consideration should be given during conditions of temperature extremes and high humidity. In large vehicles, when possible, animals 63 CHAPTER 5: ANIMAL HANDLING AND TRANSPORT Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020((should be gated off into smaller groups during trans- port to prevent pileups and death losses. Additionally, temperature extremes or exposures should be consid- ered and adequate and appropriate crating provided. Preventative or prophylactic medicinal agents and pre- transport vaccinations may also be administered in an effort to minimize diseases associated with shipping. With current concerns about antibiotic resistance, pro- phylactic antibiotics are discouraged. When animals are transported, they should be pro- vided with proper ventilation and a floor surface that minimizes slipping. When possible, animals should be shipped in groups of uniform weight and species. Trans- port stocking densities affect stress-related plasma con- stituents and carcass bruising as well as behavioral pa-rameters of cattle (Tarrant et al., 1988, 1992). Similar results have been found for swine (Lambooy and Engel, 1991; Knowles et al., 2014) and sheep (Cockram, 2007). Animal injuries, bruises, and carcass damage can re- sult from improper handling of animals during trans- port (Strappini et al., 2013). Grandin (1980a) identified rough handling, mixing of animals of different sexes, horned animals, and poorly designed, maintained, and broken equipment as major causes of carcass damage in cattle. Recommendations for facility design, loading and unloading trucks, restraint of animals, and animal handling in abattoirs have been published (Grandin, 1980a,b, 1982, 1990; Grandin and Deesing, 2008). Good driving practices such as smooth acceleration and no Table 5-2.

Thermal Environment on the Vehicle for All Species Transport and handling stresses can be aggravated greatly by adverse weather conditions, especially dur- ing rapid weather changes. Both hot weather and ex- tremely cold weather are times for particular caution. Temperature can vary greatly in different parts of a vehicle (Knezacek et al., 2010). Animals should be pro- tected from heat stress while in transit. For poultry transported under hot summer conditions, it is recom- mended to keep side curtains open (Burlinguette et al., 2012). The Heat Stress Safety Index is useful as the basis for handling and shipping decisions for swine dur- ing periods of weather extremes (National Pork Board, 2020). The index shows the relationship between tem- perature and humidity. A combination of high tempera- ture and high humidity increases the index. In heavy (160-kg) market-weight pigs, death losses were highest in the summer months (Vitali et al., 2014). However, Heat Stress Safety Index values are conservative for cattle, especially for heat-tolerant Brahman and Brah- man crosses (Grandin. 1981, 2015). For all species, heat will build up rapidly in a sta- tionary vehicle unless it has mechanical ventilation (Weeks et al., 1997; Kettlewell et al., 2000). During hot weather, vehicles should be promptly unloaded upon arrival at the destination and vehicles should start moving promptly after loading. If a loaded truck has to be parked during hot weather, fans or water mis- ters should be provided to keep animals cool (Ritz et al., 2005). Meat-type chickens, turkeys, and pigs are especially prone to heat stress. Banks of fans beside which a loaded truck can park are used extensively in the pork and poultry industries. Additional means of protection include shading, wetting, and bedding with wet sand or shavings when livestock are at high density (e.g., on a truck) and air speed is low (e.g., the truck is parked) during hot weather. Further information on the thermal environment can be found in the Guidelines for Humane Transportation of Research Animals (National Research Council, 2006). The thermal neutral zones for different animals can be found in Robertshaw (2004). During transportation, animals should also be pro- tected from cold stress (Hunter et al., 1999; Burl- inguette et al., 2012). Wind protection should be pro- vided when the effective temperature in the animal's microenvironment is expected to drop below the lower critical level. Recommendations for protecting animals from cold stress are in NAMI (2019), the National Pork Board (2020) Transport Quality Assurance Handbook, (version 7) and McGlone et al. (2014a,b,c). Pigs re- quire greater protection from cold than sheep or cattle, which have heavy coats of wool or hair. Table 5-3 shows cold protection recommendations for pigs transported in an aluminum trailer with numerous ventilation holes. When cattle are transported in this type of trailer, more of the ventilation holes can be left open. Adequate ven- tilation is always necessary. During cold weather, trucks transporting livestock should be bedded with a mate- rial having high thermal insulative properties (such as chopped straw) if the animals will spend more than a few minutes in the transport vehicle. When wood shavings are used for pigs, six 22.7-kg (50-lb) bags are recommended for a trailer of approximately 40 m2 (430 ft2) when the temperatures is 11.7\u00b0C (11\u00b0F) or lower (McGlone et al., 2014a,b). This is especially important for pigs to reduce death losses (Sutherland, et al., 2009, 2014). Based on neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio and be- havior (Sutherland et al., 2009), space allowances of 0.06 and 0.07 m2/pig were preferable to 0.05 m2/pig when transporting weaned pigs between 60 and 112 min in summer (28.4 \u00b1 1.2\u00b0C; 83 \u00b1 2\u00b0F) and winter (10.5 \u00b1 6.15\u00b0C; \u00b1 11\u00b0F). However, the effect of space al- lowance on the welfare of weaned pigs may differ when transport durations exceed 112 min. Sufficient bedding should be used to help the piglets stay dry. Vehicle Guidelines for Livestock Truck beds for livestock transport should be clean and dry and equipped with a well-bedded, nonslippery floor. Animals should be loaded and unloaded easily and promptly. Chutes and ramps should be well de- signed with nonslip flooring (Grandin, 1990). Animals should be transported at appropriate densities to reduce the chances of injury. The type of transport vehicle is also important with regard to differences between and within species of livestock. For example, depending on breed type, horses often have special transport require- ments (Houpt and Wickens, 2014). Livestock should not be transported on trucks that do not have suffi- cient clearance to accommodate their height (Grandin et al., 1999; Gray et Lee et al., 2017). International guide- lines state that animals should be able to be stand in a normal position without coming into contact with the roof or upper deck (OIE, 2019).Table 5-3.

(2014a,b,c).65 CHAPTER 5: ANIMAL HANDLING AND TRANSPORT Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020Many teaching and research activities require the frequent transport of animals. Careful loading and un- loading will reduce stress. On short trips, loading and unloading is the most stressful part of the journey. On short trips, pigs remain standing (Guise et al., 1998) and they can be stocked at a higher density than on longer trips where the animals will need more space to lie down. For heavy (129-kg) pigs, increasing the floor space from 0.39 to 0.48 m2/pig reduced transport deaths from 0.88 to 0.36% on trips lasting approximate- ly 3 h (Ritter et al., 2006). On longer trips when all the pigs will lie down, there should be sufficient space so they will be in normal lying posture without being on top of each other. Vehicles should be of adequate size and strength for the animals carried and have adequate ventilation. Stock trailers and pickup truck beds fitted with stock racks are the most frequently used vehicles for short-distance transport. The inside walls and lining of the vehicles should have no sharp edges or protru- sions that would be likely to cause injury. Animals may be transported either loose in these vehicles or, in the case of cattle, sheep, and horses, may be haltered and tied. Only animals that have been previously trained to a halter and that are of a quiet disposition should be tied when transported. Animals should be tied to the side of the vehicle in a manner that can be released quickly. The recommended height for tying is approxi- mately even with the top of the shoulder (withers). The tie should be short enough so that animals can- not step over the lead. Quick-release methods, such as quick-release knots, panic snaps, and other safety re- lease latches, should be used. Loading and Unloading Ramps for Livestock A ramp is not required when the animals are trans- ported in a low stock trailer. A well-maintained ramp with a nonslip surface is essential for loading animals onto trucks with beds of a height that exceeds an ani- mal's ability to step up onto the vehicle. Loading ramps should provide nonslip footing to prevent slipping and falling or damage to the dewclaws (van Putten and Elshof, 1978; Grandin, 1983, 1990, 2014c; Phillips et al., 1988). On concrete ramps, stair steps provide good footing (Grandin, 1990). For cattle, it is recommended that each step be 10 cm (4 in) high with a 30-cm (12- in) tread width. For all species, if the animals are not completely tame, solid sides are recommended on the loading ramp. Pigs will often be reluctant to step up onto a high step that is 20 cm (8 in) high (Goumon et al., 2013). Ramps that are too steep are stressful for pigs, so a slope of 15\u00b0 or less is recommended (Berry et al., 2012; McGlone et al., 2014a). When more gradual slopes are used, the ramp becomes excessively long when used to load the top deck of a truck (Goumon and Faucitano, 2017). In these situations, the ramp slope should not exceed 20\u00b0. Conveyors can be used to load weanling and nursery pigs but do not reduce the work required to load the animals or reduce stress (Lay et al., 2017). Horse Transport The typical vehicles designed to transport horses by road are vans, trailers, and trucks. Transport ve- hicle capacity ranges from transporting a single horse to multiple horses. During transportation, attempts should be made to minimize the trauma and anxiety of the horse. Considerations include loading procedures, manner of driving, interior space, footing, ventilation, noise, lighting, duration of transit, mixing of unfamil- iar or aggressive horses, fitness to travel, and handling (Grandin et al., 1999). Horses are sometimes transported in small groups, and sorting horses for compatibility is important to minimize stress and injuries. Considerations for sort- ing may include size, sex, and behavior. Horses should not be placed in double-deck conveyances designed for cattle because these trailers are too limited in the height from floor to ceiling for most horses and injuries are prevalent (Grandin et al., 1999; Stull, 1999). Table 5-4 shows recommended height and width requirements for horses. All vehicles should be examined before each trip for safety and maintenance. The floor planking and metal floor braces should be of sufficient strength to bear twice the weight of any horse being transported. Door latches, tiers, and hitches should be inspected be- fore the start of the trip and repaired if needed because they deteriorate with use and exposure. The required dimensions of a trailer depend on the size of the horses being hauled (Table 5-4). Horse trail- ers with individual stalls should have a butt chain or bar to prevent a horse from exiting the trailer. The rear doors may either be hinged (horse steps up into the trailer) or have a loading ramp, or both, with a strong fastening device to prevent the doors from opening dur- ing transit. In horse vans, full, solid partitions are often used between horses to form small box stalls. A partial partition located at the height of the middle of the horse's body should be used to separate horses in trail- ers and between cross-tied horses in vans. These partial partitions allow a horse to spread its legs enough to Table 5-4. Recommended dimensions of transportation accommodations for horses and ponies used in agricultural research and teaching Trailer or van dimension (m) (ft) Height of ceiling for horse Up to 1.5 m (15 hands)11.7-2.0 5.6-6.5 >1.5 m (>15 hands) 2.0-2.2 6.5-7.0 Width Single or tandem 1.2 4 Two horses abreast: 16 hands 1.7-2.0 5.6-6.6 Two horses abreast: >16 hands 5.9-10.2 1One hand is about 10 cm (4 in).66 CHAPTER 5: ANIMAL HANDLING AND TRANSPORT Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020achieve proper balance in a limited area. The flooring should not be slippery. Sand, bedding, or rubber mat- ting may provide better footing, which reduces anxiety and injuries. Leg wraps, tail wraps, bell boots, or pad- ded halters are not necessary but may be beneficial in preventing or minimizing injuries for some horses dur- ing transit. A recent survey showed that injuries were the most common transport problem (Padalino, 2015; Padalino et al., 2016). Lighting at night in the trailer and loading areas facilitates safe handling and loading of horses. Horses traveling together in small groups are usu- ally not tied during transport and may exhibit limited movement depending on the loading density within the compartment. Excessive movement of horses during transit may indicate a problem and should be assessed by the driver. Horses in trailers and vans may be tied in transit to prevent turning around and interaction with other horses and should be tied to allow for quick re- lease. Tying horses limits the movement of the head and neck. Elevation of a horse's head above the withers dur- ing transit compromises the immune system and may predispose the horse to respiratory disorders (Raidal et al., 1997). Respiratory problems can be avoided by ensuring the head is not elevated above the point of the shoulder at least every 12 h, usually by feeding hay below chest level during transit or by taking breaks to allow the horse to lower its head (Racklyeft and Love, 1990; Stull and Rodiek, 2002). Horses may need to be watered during the trip, pref- erably every 12 h and more often during hot weather conditions. Many horses traveling in trailers or vans are provided with hay while in transit. Horses without ac- cess to feed during transit should be fed at least every 24 h. Horses may experience fatigue and dehydration when traveling more than 24 h at one time, especial- ly in extreme (hot or cold) environmental conditions (Stull, 1999; Friend, 2000b; Stull and Rodiek, 2002). Regulation of air movement through the transport vehicle is essential to avoid thermal stress or excessive exposure to exhaust fumes. Appropriate ventilation is crucial during extremely hot or cold weather (Purswell et al., 2006). In hot, sunny weather, it is recommended that horses not be left in parked trailers for long peri- ods. They should be checked regularly to prevent heat stress. In cold weather, horses in moving trailers may need to be provided with blankets, especially if air flow cannot be controlled (e.g., in stock trailers that are not fully loaded). Poultry Transport Unlike the loading ramp and chute system used for livestock, broiler chickens on commercial farms are ei- ther caught manually or with automated catching ma- chines and loaded into transport crates/cages that are then stacked on an open flatbed truck. Special atten- tion to developing skilled staff for the catching, loading, and transport of poultry is important. Increased fear (Jones, 1992), leg injury (Gregory and Wilkins, 1989), and mortality have been associated with poor catch- ing and loading techniques (Weeks, 2014). Also, poorly feathered birds have greater body heat loss than well- feathered birds. The thermal neutral zone ranges from 8 to 18\u00b0C (46 to 64\u00b0F) and 24 to 28\u00b0C (75 to 82\u00b0F) for well-feathered chickens and poorly feathered chickens, respectively, under typical transit conditions of low air movement and high humidity (Webster et al., 1993). Increased time in transit, feed and water deprivation, and fatigue can cause increased death loss and stress (Vecerek et al., 2006). Therefore, these factors should be minimized. Ducks and turkeys are usually driven to a loading conveyor (Weeks, 2014). They are usually not picked up. Transport Distance and Duration for Livestock and Poultry Most animals transported for use in research and teaching will be transported short distances with dura- tions less than 6 h. In these situations, the amount of time on a transport vehicle does not become a welfare issue. A high percentage of animals will be transport- ed for less than 2 h. United States regulations require that livestock (does not include poultry) be unloaded, fed, and watered after 28 consecutive hours on a ve- hicle without food or water during interstate transport (USDA, 1994). The US Humane Slaughter Act requires that livestock in the lairage (stockyards) of a slaughter plant must have access to water (USDA-FSIS, 1979). People who use agricultural animals in research and teaching need to minimize the time that livestock or poultry are on vehicles. There may be situations where research has to be conducted on a commercial farm, feedlot, or slaughterhouse when the researcher has no control over the transport conditions or the time that the livestock or poultry remain on the vehicle. Regulatory Requirements for Transport Transporters must comply with all county, state, and federal animal health regulations and identification re- quirements before transporting livestock and poultry. When animals are transported across state lines or from foreign countries, federal regulations for vaccinations, veterinary inspections, and health certificates must be complied with. There are different regulations for each species, and each state may also have regulations for health certificates. State animal health laws apply to all animals transported within a state. Some western states have brand inspection laws that require certifi- cates of ownership and inspection of the livestock by an inspector. In some states, animals transported short distances must have certificates. Transporters should be knowledgeable of regulatory requirements. Interna- tional regulations for transporting animals have been 67 CHAPTER 5: ANIMAL HANDLING AND TRANSPORT Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020summarized (ILAR Transportation Guide; National Re- search Council, 2006). Lairage Recommendations Before Slaughter for Livestock After the animals are unloaded from the transport vehicle, lairage pens must be provided. Pigs should al- ways have sufficient space so that all the pigs can lie down without being on top of each other. Livestock must have sufficient space to all lie down if they are held overnight (USDA-FSIS, 2017; NAMI, 2019). All livestock must have access to water. Table 5-5 shows recommended space requirements for cattle, pigs, and sheep. Emergency Procedures for the Research Facility and Transporters Both research facilities and people transporting ani- mals should have a list of emergency contact phone numbers. Police (telephone number) Fire (telephone number) Ambulance (telephone number) Emergency contacts 1 and 2: work, home, and mobile numbers. When livestock or poultry are transported more than a few miles, local police and fire department numbers will not be usable. It is recommended to either call 911 or carry other numbers for first responders along the route. It is also recommended to carry the num- bers of local people along your route who could assist with handling or euthanizing animals after an accident. Other useful information includes the locations of fair- grounds, auction markets, and other facilities where the animals could be unloaded during an emergency. REFERENCES Abbott, T. A., E. J.

J. 25:39-44.75 CHAPTER 5: ANIMAL HANDLING AND TRANSPORT Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020Beef cattle include all animals of the genus Bos and their close relatives that are raised primarily for meat production. Beef cattle have enjoyed a long and mu- tually beneficial association with humans (Rollin and Thompson, 2012) and are uniquely positioned, along with other ruminants, to make effective use of feedstuffs that are not used to feed humans (Lardy and Caton, 2012; NASEM, 2016; Mottet et al., 2017). Bos animals that are used for milk production are covered in Chap- ter 7: Dairy Cattle of this guide. As ruminants, beef cattle are capable of using a wide range of feedstuffs and consequently are maintained in an array of situations, from extensive grazing conditions to confined feedlot pens and intensive laboratory environments (NASEM, 2016). Regardless of the housing system, good animal husbandry dictates that needs for food, water, shelter, and comfort that are based upon the best available sci- ence and practical experience should be met. FACILITIES AND ENVIRONMENT Ideal Thermal Conditions Heat production in cattle is from metabolism and fer- mentation within the digestive tract (NASEM, 2016). Cattle dissipate heat through radiation, evaporation, convection, and conduction. The regulation of both heat production and dissipation allows a nearly constant body temperature to be maintained in healthy cattle. Within the thermoneutral zone (TNZ), and certainly within the narrower thermal comfort zone (TCZ), heat production by cattle is essentially independent of envi- ronmental temperature, and body temperature is regu- lated primarily by heat dissipation (NASEM, 2016). As the effective ambient temperature (EAT) moves out of the TNZ and either below the lower critical temper- ature (LCT) or above the upper critical temperature (UCT), cattle experience cold or heat stress, respec- tively, which may, depending upon the severity and du- ration, dictate management strategies to offset environ- mental extremes (NRC, 1981; Mader, 2014; NASEM, 2016). When temperatures move outside of the TCZ and TNZ, cattle metabolism and behavior can change to partially offset temperature extremes and effectively move the EAT experienced by cattle back toward the TNZ (NRC, 1981; NASEM, 2016). For example, cattle familiar with their environment will make use of wind- breaks and sunny slopes (Keren and Olson, 2006a,b, 2007; Caton and Olson, 2016) during cold extremes, and use shade (Mader, 2014; Hagenmaier et al., 2016) during heat extremes in an attempt to mitigate the consequences of weather extremes. Additional energy requirements associated with cold or heat stress are discussed in the Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle, 8th revised edition (NASEM, 2016). Under most environmental conditions, temperature represents a major portion of the driving force for heat exchange between cattle and their environment. How- ever, moisture and heat content of the air, thermal radiation, and airflow also affect total heat exchange. Thus, a combination of environmental variables con- tributes to the conditions of EAT, to which cattle re- spond (NRC, 1981; NASEM, 2016). Environmental conditions that provide maximum comfort (i.e., TCZ) and require little or no energy ex- penditure for maintenance depend on cattle age, meta- bolic size, body mass, surface area, animal behavior, and the degree to which cattle have been adapted to the environment. It should be noted that the TCZ and TNZ are often confused in the literature and sometimes mislabeled. The TCZ is the temperature range where the animal is most comfortable and no (or very little) additional energy from the altered metabolic rate is needed to maintain body temperature. The TNZ is the range of temperatures within which cattle can maintain temperature homeostasis through normal physiological, metabolic, and behavioral processes (NRC, 1981; Fed- eration of Animal Science Societies, 2010). The TCZ generally ranges between 15 and 25\u00b0C (59 and 77\u00b0F) for most cattle less than 1 mo old; between 5 and 20\u00b0C (41 and 68\u00b0F) for mature beef cows consuming a main- tenance diet; and between 10 (14 and 68\u00b0F) and 20\u00b0C for yearlings with ad libitum access to energy-dense feedlot diets (NRC, 1981; Federation of Animal Science Societies, 2010). Based on physiological responses (Be- atty et al., 2006) and heat load thresholds (Gaughan et al., 2008), Bos indicus and some heat-tolerant Bos taurus cattle breeds (Gaughan et al., 1999) have a TCZ that is shifted upward by 5\u00b0C (9\u00b0F) compared with that of typical Bos taurus cattle.CHAPTER 6: BEEF CATTLE 76Encompassing the TCZ is the TNZ. Within the TNZ, an animal can maintain homeostasis through normal physiological and metabolic processes; energy expen- diture and behavior modifications may be required when the animal is exposed to conditions outside the TCZ (Hahn, 1985; Young et al., 1989; Caton and Ol- son, 2016). The TNZ generally ranges between 10 and 30\u00b0C (50 and 86\u00b0F) for most cattle less than 1 mo old; between 15 and 28\u00b0C (5 and 82\u00b0F) for mature beef cows consuming a maintenance diet; and between 35 and 25\u00b0C (31 and 77\u00b0F) for yearlings with ad libitum access to energy-dense feedlot diets (NRC, 1981; Fed- eration of Animal Science Societies, 2010; University of California-Davis, 2012). Even though the upper end of the TNZ for most Bos taurus cattle is between 25 and 30\u00b0C (77 and 86\u00b0F), for high-producing cattle with high intakes of metabolizable energy, the upper limit may be closer to 20\u00b0C (68\u00b0F) on sunny days when little or no wind is present (NRC, 1981; Brown-Brandl et al., 2006). When provided sufficient time, cattle acclimate and adapt to colder or hotter conditions. It should be noted that cattle adapted to 35\u00b0C (31\u00b0F) may be uncomfortable (show signs of heat stress) at 10\u00b0C (50\u00b0F). Thus, the TCZ and TNZ serve only as guide- lines to describe the limits within which cattle are com- fortable and can adapt to, respectively. Independent of these guidelines, performance standards that indicate a problem with the thermal environment include, in cold weather, shivering, huddling, and loss of body condi- tion/weight; and in hot weather, panting, sweating, and a decrease in feed intake. Primary factors that affect thermal comfort include feed or energy intake, body condition or subcutaneous fat cover, and the animal's ability to express behaviors that reduce the impact of adverse environments. Thermal Indices The temperature-humidity index (THI), where THI = 0.8 \u00d7 ambient temperature + [(% relative humid- ity/100) \u00d7 (ambient temperature 14.4)] + 46.4, has become the de facto standard for classifying thermal en- vironments in many animal studies and for selection of management practices during seasons other than win- ter (Hahn et al., 2003; Mader, 2003; Amundson et al., 2006; Mader et al., 2006). The THI, first proposed by Thom (1959), has been extensively applied in moder- ate to hot conditions, even with recognized limitations related to airspeed and radiation heat loads (NOAA, 1976). A THI between 70 and 74 is an indication to producers that the potential for heat stress in livestock exists (LCI, 1970). In particular, when THI values are >70 by 0800 h, it is recommended that managers of confined cattle with high metabolic heat loads (e.g., feedlot cattle) initiate or prepare to initiate heat-stress management strategies before cattle become exposed to the excessive heat load (Mader et al., 2000). A THI of 84 or above is critical (Hagenmaier et al., 2016) and can cause death, especially in feedlot cattle that are within 45 d of slaughter and consuming high-energy finishing diets. Modifications to the THI have been developed to overcome the shortcomings related to the lack of ac- counting for airflow and radiation heat load in the index (Mader et al., 2006). Eigenberg et al. (2005) developed similar adjustments based on predictions of respiration rates using ambient and dew point temperature, wind speed, and solar radiation. These models have merit in that the combined effects of multiple environmental factors can be taken into account when determining animal comfort. Gaughan et al. (2008) developed a more extensive index as a guide to the management of feedlot cattle during hot weather. The heat load index (HLI) incor- porates black globe temperature (Buffington et al., 1981), relative humidity, and wind speed. A thresh- old (HLI = 86), above which cattle are less efficient at dissipating heat was developed for a reference animal (healthy, black, predominantly Angus, steers without access to shade, 100 to 150 d on feed, and a summer hair coat). The threshold for a straightbred Brahman steer is 96. Adjustments to the threshold are possible for use of shade, clean dry pens, cattle coat color, and days on feed. The thresholds are lowered if cattle are sick (5) or not acclimated to summer conditions (5). Gaughan et al. (2008) also described accumulated heat load (AHL), which arises from insufficient night cool- ing and results in animals entering the day with an accumulated heat load. Gaughan et al. (2008) reported that HLI and AHL were highly correlated. Insufficient recovery periods from elevated HLI results in increased AHL. Recovery time is the time needed to bring body temperature back to normal. Recovery periods have been recommended to be 6 h with a THI <70 or can be calculated by the equations provided by Gaughan et al. (2002). Additional information on management of cattle exposed to adverse environmental conditions is presented in the review by Mader (2014), and readers are referred there for additional information. Limited data exist for assessing environmental effects on reproduction. Amundson et al. (2006) found THI and daily minimum temperature to be equally corre- lated with pregnancy rate at 42 d into the breeding season. However, the combination of wind speed and THI were strongly correlated (r = 0.79) with pregnancy rate. Paula-Lopes et al. (2013) concluded that high en- vironmental temperature and resulting heat shock can reduce reproductive efficiency by negatively affecting the oocyte and early embryonic stages of development. Additionally, observed effects were more pronounced in Bos taurus than in Bos indicus genotypes. Indices for cold stress are not as well defined as they are for heat stress. The wind chill index (WCI) has traditionally been used to derive an apparent tempera- ture for humans. In 2001, the National Weather Service (NWS, 2008) released a new WCI that may have merit for assessing the effects of wind on domestic livestock (see Chapter 3: Husbandry, Housing, and Biosecurity 77 CHAPTER 6: BEEF CATTLE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020for discussion). Mitigating the chilling effects of wind during periods of cold stress through the use of wind- breaks increases cattle comfort (Mader, 2014; NASEM, 2016). Mader (2014) outlines and discusses several practical approaches to enhancing animal comfort in feedlot pens and other areas during the winter. From the above discussion, it is evident that beef cattle can be adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions and that zones of cattle comfort vary de- pending upon many factors. It should be emphasized that UCT and LCT for individual animals are moving targets (NRC, 1981; NASEM, 2016). For beef cattle, care should be taken to match genetics to environment in production systems. Cattle, like other animals that we care for, should not suffer from hypo- or hyperther- mia. If they do, management techniques including but not limited to shade, fans, misting, windbreaks, bed- ding, and dietary adjustments should be provided when practical or unless approved care and use protocols jus- tify and dictate otherwise. Within range and pasture- based production systems, hypo- and hyperthermia should be avoided when and if possible. Beef cattle used for research or teaching may be housed in inten- sive management systems, either indoors or in open lots, with or without shelter. Facilities should provide cattle with an environment that mitigates hypo- and hyperthermia and presents opportunities for behavioral thermoregulation when needed (e.g., access to a wind- break, sunshade, mound, or roofed shelter). Range and Pasture Systems Acceptable systems for grazing beef cattle on pasture and rangeland vary widely. Cow body condition is a measure of degree of fatness (body energy reserves) and is widely used as a performance standard for monitoring the well-being and nutritional status of cattle. The Nu- trient Requirements of Beef Cattle (8th rev. ed.; NASEM, 2016) discusses body condition score (BCS) in detail, and readers are referred there for additional informa- tion. Body condition score naturally fluctuates across season and within normal management paradigms. This is particularly the case in pasture and extensive grazing production scenarios, and NASEM (2016) has modeled and recommended management and feeding approaches to move cattle from thin or obese back to a moderate BCS. Biologically, cattle evolved in grazing environments, and seasonal swings in BCS reflect both forage quantity and quality and seasonal environmental conditions. Dry forage organic matter intake measured in 19 trials within extensive western rangeland graz- ing conditions has been reported to range from 0.91 to 2.57% of live body weight (BW) and average intake was 1.49 and 2.17% of live BW during forage dormancy and the growing season, respectively (Krysl et al., 1987). These ranges in grazing cattle intake are supported by more recent work by Cline et al. (2009), who reported that dry forage organic matter intakes of grazing cattle ranged from 1.14 to 2.61% of BW. Extremes in body condition can affect calf birth weight. For example, NASEM (2016) states \"Calf birth weights are positively related to BCS when cows are below BCS 3.5, remain- ing constant between BCS 3.5 to 7, and are inversely related to BCS when cows are above BCS 7.\" As in cows, BW and BCS of bulls fluctuate throughout the year, with bulls losing considerable weight and condi- tion during the breeding season. Variation in intake and BCS experienced by cattle are natural components of range and pasture management systems, and have and will continue to underpin research programs focused on improving production and care, not only in range and pasture systems but in other production systems as well. Within range and pasture-based production systems, hypo- and hyperthermia should be avoided. Beef cows decrease grazing time and forage intake as ambient temperature decreases below 0\u00b0C or 32\u00b0F (Adams et al., 1986), although such changes are small in adapted beef cows (Beverlin et al., 1989). Cattle use windbreaks to decrease wind chill and prevent exposure to blow- ing snow, although the benefits of natural or manmade windbreaks vary depending upon the severity of the weather (temperature and wind speed) and effectiveness of the windbreak in decreasing wind exposure (Krysl and Torell, 1988; Mader et al., 1997). Supplementary feed should be provided during periods of heavy snow cover that preclude grazing or during other times when nutrient demand exceeds nutrients supplied by avail- able forage for specified production and health goals. In areas where exposure to extreme cold is likely, provision of shelter for grazing beef cattle may be desirable When ambient temperature and thermal radiation exceed cattle body surface temperature, then cattle cannot dissipate their body heat by the standard mech- anisms of conduction, radiation, or convection; conse- quently, cattle will gain heat. Some moderate increas- es in daytime heat gains can normally be dissipated through changes in behavior (seeking shade or water) or through cooling during less warm periods during the day or night (NASEM, 2016). Heat stress is evidenced when respiration rates begin to increase in attempts to dissipate body heat. Respiration rate and panting scores have been used as measures of the degree of heat stress (NRC, 1981; Mader et al., 2006; Hales et al., 2014). Respiration rate can be predicted from tem- perature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar ra- diation (Eigenberg et al., 2005). Prolonged increases in body temperature will result in decreased feed intake, body condition, and weight (Robertshaw, 1987; Hahn, 1995). Initial decreases in intake are likely associated with physiological demands for reduced metabolic heat production resulting from periods of heat stress. Beef cattle managed in grazing conditions may use location, position, or orientation to mitigate excessive heat loads (Caton and Olson, 2016). An adequate supply of forage should be available to grazing cattle. Intake and performance may be de- creased when the amount of standing forage is lack-78 CHAPTER 6: BEEF CATTLE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020ing (NRC, 1987), but the appropriate quantity of for- age dry matter per hectare varies with the pasture or range type and stocking rate. Guidelines for acceptable amounts of standing forage per unit of BW at given stocking rates (herbage allowance) are available (NRC, 1987). Grazing beef cattle are often supplemented to meet performance goals or when forage quality or quan- tity becomes limiting to support desired production or stocking rates. Supplementation strategies for grazing livestock vary regionally, by management system, and per performance goals. In almost all grazing environ- ments, range cattle are provided free-choice access to supplemental salt as a source of sodium. Often, salt- based, free-choice mineral supplements will also be for- tified with trace minerals. Observation and monitoring often occur less regu- larly for range cattle than for other livestock. When supplemental feed is provided, cattle are usually ob- served at least 2 or 3 times weekly. Nonsupplemented cattle on open range may be observed less frequently; however, it is recommended that, when possible, range cattle be observed at least once per week. In certain areas, grazing beef cattle may be affected by predators and poisonous plants. Careful attention should be dedi- cated to such problems, and efforts should be made to manage or mitigate these adverse conditions. Water is available to cattle from intake of free wa- ter, ingestion of water associated with feedstuffs, and metabolic water. Practically, metabolic water contrib- utes little to overall water demand. Adapted cattle can consume snow and ice in the absence of liquid water in adequate amounts to offset the absence of drinking wa- ter in extensive winter grazing systems (CSIRO, 2007; NASEM, 2016). Cattle appear to prefer liquid water, and water availability is critical for the performance and health of grazing beef cattle (NASEM, 2016). Dis- tance to water should be given consideration in pasture and range systems. If cattle are required to travel long distances to water in hot, dry climates, animal perfor- mance and utilization of pasture forage can be affected (Fusco et al., 1995). Data evaluating distance between water sources in extensive grazing systems are limited; however, Holechek et al. (2011) recommended that the distance to water be no greater than 1.6 km (1 mi) in rolling, hilly country and in undulating, sandy terrain. This recommendation was decreased to 0.8 km (0.5 mi) in rough country, increased to 2.4 km (1.5 mi) in smooth, sandy terrain, and increased to 3.2 km (2 mi) in areas with flat terrain. Thus, the distance to water for grazing cattle is important, and every animal should have the opportunity to drink ad libitum at least once per day. Feedlot and Housing Systems Beef cattle used for research or teaching may be housed in intensive management systems, either in- doors or in open lots, with or without shelter. Facilities should provide cattle with an environment that miti- gates hypo- and hyperthermia and presents opportuni- ties for behavioral thermoregulation when needed (e.g., access to a windbreak, sunshade, mound, or roofed shelter). Management of dairy beef is similar to other cattle, although, some feeding, housing, and marketing regimens are unique to Holsteins (University of Min- nesota Extension, 2005). Proper airflow and ventilation are essential in inten- sive facilities. In feedlots, cable or wire fencing has min- imal effect on natural airflow in summer. However, high airflow rates are undesirable during periods of low tem- perature, and tree shelterbelts and other types of wind- breaks can decrease the rate of airflow past the cattle. An 80% solid windbreak 3 m (10 ft) high (minimum recommended height) decreases wind speed by half for about 45 m (150 ft) downwind and controls snow for about 8 m (25 ft); a similar windbreak 4 m (13 ft) high decreases wind speed by half for about 65 m (200 ft) downwind and controls snow for about 10 m (30 ft). A windbreak is recommended in mounded, south-sloping feedlots in the northern United States to provide dry resting areas with low air velocities. Caution is advised when placing cattle in sheltered areas in the summer because of the adverse effects of restricted airflow on cattle in hot environments (Mader et al., 1999). During potentially stressful heat episodes (nighttime THI 70), panting scores (1 = elevated respiration rate, 2 = drool or saliva present on side of mouth, 3 = open mouth breathing observed, and 4 = tongue and neck extended with open mouth breathing) can be used as an indicator of stress level (Mader et al., 2006; Mader, 2014). When cattle are beginning to experience panting scores of 2 or greater, some means of cooling may be needed. Cattle learn to take evasive action to alleviate heat stress, and competition for cooler areas in a pen or around the water trough increases, even during cooler days when heat alleviation methods (e.g., sprinkling) are not used (Mader et al., 2007). When this occurs, evidence of crowding is observed, which ex- acerbates heat stress problems. Wetting the ground or floor of holding facilities can be an effective method of cooling cattle managed in outdoor units without shade and where surface vegetation is sparse or nonexistent (Mader, 2003, 2014; Mader and Davis, 2004). Direct wetting of cattle during extreme heat is also an effec- tive practice and is often used as an emergency mea- sure. In these cases, care must be taken to allow cattle to acclimate because applying significant amounts of cold water to hot cattle can cause additional stress. Ad- ditionally, actively cooling cattle after maximum ambi- ent temperature occurs is more effective at reducing heat load compared with active cooling during peak ambient temperature (Lees et al., 2019). Benefits of sprinkling are enhanced if sprinkling is started in the morning before cattle experience high heat loads (Da- vis et al., 2003). A daily application of 0.5 to 1.0 cm of water is sufficient to cool pen surfaces. Applying 1.25 to 79 CHAPTER 6: BEEF CATTLE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 20201.50 cm every other day is also acceptable and will not sufficiently contribute to mud build-up in normally dry pens. In areas with high evaporation rates (>1.0 cm of water/day), additional water may be needed, which can serve to cool pen surfaces as well as eliminate potential dust problems. The size of the area to be sprinkled would be similar to the shade area recommendations. As a routine protective practice, wetting can be effi- ciently accomplished by using a timer to provide 5 to 10 min of spray during each 20- to 30-min period. Fogger nozzles are often mistakenly recommended for wetting animals. Fogger nozzles are less effective than sprinkler nozzles because of the barrier formed by the fine drop- lets (mist). These droplets adhere to the outer hair coat of the animal, causing the heat for evaporation to come from the air rather than from the body. Mitl\u00f6hner et al. (2001) reported that misting cattle was not as ef- fective as shade in decreasing heat stress, and in some cases, caused the respiration rate to increase compared with that in cattle that were not misted. Additionally, Mader (2014) presented potential negative effects of sprinkling in some circumstance, including acclimation of cattle to sprinkler systems and elevated pen humid- ity in environments with poor air flow or when too large of an area is sprinkled. Shade for cattle can mitigate hyperthermia for ani- mals that are not conditioned to a sudden heat wave with high solar radiant loads, such as experienced in the central and southern regions of the United States. Mad- er et al. (1999) found limited performance benefits of shade in the north-central region of the United States, in contrast to the findings of Mitl\u00f6hner et al. (2001), which indicated that shade was effective in southern regions. In addition, use of shade may be costly and logistically prohibitive because of snow load require- ments (unless shade is taken down after the summer), potential mud problems under shade (low evaporation rates), and the low percentage of time that cattle may actually benefit from using the shade. Mitl\u00f6hner et al. (2001, 2002) found favorable results when shade was provided for feedlot cattle reared in the south-central region of the United States, an area where more consis- tent benefits of shade would be expected to be realized. Although recouping benefits from shade structures through improved performance can be challenging, put- ting shade structures in sick pens or in pens with cat- tle prone to heat stress will be helpful. Hagenmaier et al. (2016) indicated that provision of shade for feedlot cattle in Kansas increased feed intake and dressing per- centage in feedlot cattle nearing the end of the finishing phase. Shade structures should allow air movement but must be able to withstand strong winds, especially in certain regions. Improperly designed shade structures could risk animal or human injury or harm. Design- ing shade structures requires careful consideration of location, orientation, and height, as well as repair and maintenance to prevent injury and regular cleaning un- der the shade to minimize increased pen floor humidity (Eirich et al., 2015). While providing shade alone will likely not completely eliminate the effects of high heat loads, the goal of providing shade is to reduce heat stress and prevent hyperthermia. Cattle subject to en- vironments that could precipitate hyperthermia need to be observed for signs of heat stress, and management action should be taken as needed. Unheated housing may be provided for beef cattle. Open sides of any cattle building need to face away from the prevailing winds. Such structures are venti- lated by natural airflow, and the resultant winter tem- peratures are typically warmer than outdoor conditions as a result of body heat and wind protection. Totally enclosed housing requires ventilation to maintain the air temperature at acceptable levels and to minimize the accumulation of water vapor, noxious gases, other odorous compounds, and dust in the air. Ventilation systems may be either natural or mechanical. Type of pen surface affects dustiness during hot dry weather and mud or manure build-up during wet pe- riods. Good drainage of outside pens is imperative. Soil-surfaced pens should be regularly cleaned of ani- mal waste and maintained to minimize accumulation of water. In areas subject to excessive mud, a hard surface apron in front of the feed bunks and around water troughs and shelters should be considered in soil- surfaced pens. When slope and drying conditions are inadequate, mounds should also be provided in soil- surfaced pens for cattle to lie on during wet and mud- dy soil conditions (Table 6-1). Accumulation of mud in a pen or on the cattle can influence maintenance energy requirements and thermal balance (NASEM, 2016). Properly designed pens with adequate slope are extremely important for minimizing mud and related health and behavior problems. In areas where slope or drying conditions are limited, adding mounds is very useful for keeping cattle clean and dry. Under hot-humid conditions, mounds aid in preventing animal crowding and improve exposure to airflow for the animals that use them. Additional information on feedlot/drylot pen design and layout has been published by Pohl (2002) and Henry et al. (2007). For hard-surfaced pens, materials should be durable, slip-resistant, and impervious to water and urine; easily cleaned; and resistant to chemicals and corrosion from animal feed and waste. Concrete floors should be scored or grooved during construction to improve animal foot- ing. Properly designed slotted floors are self-cleaning. Fences, pen dividers, walls, gates, and other surfaces must be strong enough to withstand the impact of di- rect animal contact. Configuration and treatment of contact surfaces must minimize or eliminate protru- sions, changes in elevation, and sharp corners to elimi- nate or minimize bruising and injuries and to improve the efficiency of cattle handling (Mader, 2014). Proper lighting permits inspection of animals in feed- lots and other cattle housing systems and provides safer working conditions for animal care personnel. Mainte-80 CHAPTER 6: BEEF CATTLE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020nance of facilities (e.g., repair of fences and equipment) should be timely and ongoing. FEED AND WATER Diets for beef cattle should be formulated according to published and accepted recommendations (NASEM, 2016). Formulations should consider factors such as en- vironmental conditions, breed or biological type, sex, and production demands for growth, gestation, or lac- tation. Feed and water should be offered to cattle in ways that minimize contamination by urine, feces, and other materials. Feed bunks should be monitored daily, and contaminants or spoiled feed should be removed. In most situations, feed is often available for a large percentage of the day, even though cattle do not eat continuously and in situations where feed is abundant. Instead, cattle eat in bouts and then ruminate, return- ing to eat again later. In some management situations, overconsumption of feed can be problematic, result- ing in excessive BCS, and negatively affect reproduc- tive performance in both females and males. Limited feeding of diets may be practiced to meet maintenance requirements or targeted production goals or even to return males and females to optimal BCS for breeding. When limit feeding is practiced, feed should be uni- formly distributed to allow all cattle to have simultane- ous access to the diet. When high-energy diets are fed, Table 6-1.

When considering space allocations, decisions should be based on slope, rainfall, size of cattle, season, and group size, as discussed in the text.81 CHAPTER 6: BEEF CATTLE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020increased attentiveness should be given to the possible occurrence of diet-related health problems such as grain overload, lactic acidosis, and bloat. Abrupt changes in diets should be avoided; however, extreme weather con- ditions can lead to feed deprivation in many production systems. Feed deprivation for more than a day should be avoided unless justified in the animal use protocol. Cattle can vary considerably in BW and condition during the course of grazing and reproductive cycles (see discussion above on BCS). Feeding programs should allow animals to regain BW that is lost during normal periods of negative energy balance. Modeling normal periods of negative energy balance within ex- perimental protocols is often needed to appropriately address relevant animal performance, welfare, and food production questions. Cattle should have access to a source of water unless the research or animal care pro- tocol requires otherwise. When continuous access to water is not possible, water should be available ad libi- tum at least once daily and more often if hot weather conditions exist or cattle have high levels of metab- olizable energy intake for purposes of achieving high output (growth or milk). Under winter range condi- tions, Degen and Young (1990a,b) found that snow can be used as a water source for beef cows and growing calves. However, consumption of snow resulted in de- creased water intake as shown by compensatory water intake when water was reintroduced following 84 d of consuming water in the form of snow. When snow was the only source of water, total water intake averaged approximately 10% less. The quantity and quality of water available will in- fluence water consumption and animal comfort, espe- cially under hot conditions. Evaporation of moisture from the skin surface (sweating) or respiratory tract (panting) are the primary mechanisms used by cattle to lose excess body heat in a hot environment. Estimates of daily water requirements for beef cattle are available in Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle (8th rev. ed.; NASEM, 2016). During summer months, in particular, waterer space availability and water intake per animal become extremely important. Under these conditions, Mader et al. (1997) found that as much as 3 times the normal waterer space [7.5 vs. 2.5 cm (3 vs. 1 in) of linear space per animal] may be needed to allow for suf- ficient room for all animals to access and benefit from available water. Additional waterer space recommenda- tions are provided by MWPS (1987). HUSBANDRY Adequate care of cattle and calves is especially im- portant for establishing and maintaining optimal im- mune system function. Good husbandry can minimize health problems and infectious diseases. The risk of disease and mortality in young calves is related to im- mune status (Postema and Mol, 1984; McDonough et al., 1994). It is critical that newborn calves nurse or in-gest colostrum soon after birth. Additional information on the care of the newborn calf is available in Chapter 7: Dairy Cattle of this guide. The health of young growing cattle should be as- sessed regularly before and after weaning. Animal care personnel should be taught to recognize signs of illness and external parasites. Alert caretakers should have the ability to perceive appropriate behavior and posture. A system of monitoring calves through critical stress periods such as weaning should be established. Any sick or injured calves should be treated promptly. Daily re- cords for all treated calves and their treatment should be maintained. For cattle reared in close confinement (e.g., cattle in feedlots), assessments should be con- ducted at least once daily and more often if cattle have been stressed or potentially exposed to conditions in which their health could be compromised. In general, confined feedlot cattle, especially new incoming cattle, require more frequent observations than nonconfined cattle (i.e., on range or pasture) because of the great- er probability of animal health being compromised by commingling, dehydration, digestive problems, respira- tory problems, or interactions of any of these factors with environmental stress. Signs of healthy calves are alert ears and clear eyes, no signs of diarrhea, and, on arising, resumption of a normal standing posture af- ter stretching. For feedlot cattle provided energy-dense diets, caretaker knowledge of acidosis and manage- ment regimens necessary to minimize digestive prob- lems are essential. More details on causes, implications, and management of stress can be found in the \"Stress\" chapter of the NASEM (2016). Appropriate medication and vaccination programs should be used to decrease the incidence of disease and mortality, improve cattle health and performance, and ensure that no illegal residues occur in the carcass (Wilson and Dietrich, 1993). Treatment and vaccina- tion schemes should be based on veterinary advice and experience. Weaning In typical beef cow/calf production systems, calves are artificially weaned from their dams by physical separation. This process, albeit important to the ef- ficiency of the cow herd, can be stressful to both the cow and calf. The most common weaning procedure involves an abrupt separation of cows and calves, re- sulting in increased walking and vocalization and de- creased eating and resting by both the cows and their calves (Veissier and Le Neindre, 1989). An alternative to abrupt weaning and permanent separation is a pe- riod (approximately 7 d) of fenceline contact between cows and calves in adjacent but separate pastures. This weaning management alternative has been shown to decrease vocalization and walking (or pacing) and in- crease the time spent resting and grazing (Price et al., 2003). This fenceline weaning procedure may also de-82 CHAPTER 6: BEEF CATTLE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020crease the incidence of calf illness (Boyles et al., 2007). Within the weaning pasture or pen, a mature cow can be included in the group of freshly weaned calves. This \"trainer\" cow can assist in introduction of the weaned calves to the location and facilitate consumption of feed and water (Gibb et al., 2000). Bailey et al. (2016) inves- tigated 3 different calf weaning strategies, including dry lot weaning with dam separation and concentrate feed- ing, fenceline weaning with dam contact, and fenceline weaning with supplemental access to concentrate feed. They concluded that weaning strategy yielded differ- ences in calf performance during the weaning and re- ceiving period, but no differences in final BW, days on feed, or harvested carcass characteristics were reported. Regardless of the weaning process selected, it is impor- tant that weaned calves be provided access to clean water and a source of feed, forage, or both. To encour- age intake, highly palatable forage and feed sources are recommended until calves become accustomed to the separation from their dams. Additional information on best management practices for newly weaned calves for improved health and well-being can be found in Wilson et al. (2017) and Riggs et al. (2019). Social Environment Cattle are social animals. Each individual in the group should have sufficient access to the resources nec- essary for comfort, adequate well-being, and optimal performance. Mixing, crowding, group composition, and competition for limited resources are part of the social environment and, in some circumstances, may be social stressors for certain cattle. Generally, cows from similar environments but from different social groups can be mixed with little or no long-term adverse effect on performance (Mench et al., 1990); however, because introduced cows may be the recipients of aggression, the number of mixing episodes should be minimized. Mixing of older cattle, especially bulls, results in more fighting than when younger cattle are mixed (Tennes- sen et al., 1985). Fighting and mounting can be a prob- lem associated with keeping bulls in social groups and can present a significant welfare problem if not man- aged carefully (Fraser and Broom, 1990; Mounier et al., 2005). Attempts should be made to keep bulls in stable social groups and to minimize mixing. When feed, water, or other resources critical for comfort or survival are limited, or when large differ- ences exist among cattle in size or other traits related to position in the social order, some animals may be able to prevent others from gaining access to resources. In properly designed facilities, all individuals should have sufficient access to feed, water, and resting sites to minimize the relationship between position in the social order and productive performance (Hafez, 1975; Stricklin and Kautz-Scanavy, 1984; Fraser and Broom, 1990). Proper animal care includes observation of groups and individuals within groups to ensure that each indi-vidual has adequate access to the resources necessary for optimal comfort, welfare, and performance. Floor or Ground Area Area recommendations for open lots and barns are listed in Table 6-1. Every animal should have sufficient space to move about at will, adequate access to feed and water, a comfortable resting site, and the oppor- tunity to remain reasonably dry and clean. These sug- gested recommendations alone do not ensure that an ideal environment exists; however, in some cases, these conditions can be met with less than the recommended area. In addition to the size of cattle being housed, the area required is affected by type and slope of floor or soil surface, amount of rainfall, amount of sunshine, season, group size, and method of feeding. Open feedlot pens need to be sloped to promote drain- age away from feed bunks, waterers, pen dividers, and resting areas. Space allocations are related directly to slope. In temperate Midwestern climates, the following relationships have been found to be workable (MWPS, 1987): 2% slope or less: 37 to 74 m2 (400 to 800 ft2) per animal; 2 to 4% slope: 23 to 37 m2 (250 to 400 ft2); and 4% or greater slope: 14 to 23 m2 (150 to 250 ft2). Space allocations can be less in drier regions of the country. In the Southwest, at 0% slope, typical allocations are 14 to 23 m2 (150 to 250 ft2) per animal. In other regions, space allocations may need to be increased above Mid- western norms in consideration of such factors such as soil type and rainfall distribution. Simroth et al. (2017) provides a recent review of current practices used in the High Plains region of the United States (Texas, Okla- homa, New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas, and Nebraska). Area requirements for cattle are greatly influenced by group size. One animal housed separately in a pen requires the greatest amount of floor area on a per- animal basis. As group size increases, the amount of area required per individual decreases. When an ani- mal is housed individually, the minimum pen width and length should be at least equal to the length of the animal from nose tip to tail head when the animal is standing in a normal erect posture. Acceptable indoor pen floor surfaces for beef cattle include unfinished concrete, grooved concrete, concrete slats, expanded metal, plastic-covered metal flooring, and rubberized mats. Keane et al. (2018a) concluded that the equation y = 0.033w0.667 (y = space allowance, m2; w = body weight, kg) is sufficient for estimating the space required by finishing beef cattle housed on concrete slatted floors. Recently, Keane et al. (2018b) reported that flooring type (concrete, slatted, matted, or bedded) had no influence on lying duration, dirt scores, or performance measures. In feedlot steers, the floor surface in stanchions and metabolism stalls may be concrete, expanded metal, wood, rubberized mats, or a combination of materials that provides support for the animals' bodies; it does not damage hooves, feet, legs, and tails; and it can be cleaned.83 CHAPTER 6: BEEF CATTLE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020STANDARD AGRICUL TURAL PRACTICES For beef cattle, management procedures may be per- formed by properly trained, nonprofessional person- nel. These include, but are not limited to, vaccinating, dehorning, and castrating young cattle; horn tipping, ear weighing, implanting, hy- draulic and manual restraint, roping, hoof trimming, routine calving assistance, ultrasonographic pregnancy checking, feeding, and watering. Other hus- bandry and health practices used in beef cattle research and teaching that similarly may be performed by prop- erly trained, nonprofessional personnel but that require special technical training and advanced skill levels, in- clude, but are not limited to, artificial insemination, electro-ejaculation, pregnancy palpation, embryo flush- ing and transfer, nonroutine calving assistance and dys- tocia treatment, emergency cesarean section, retained placenta treatment, and dehorning and castration of older cattle. One of the main animal husbandry concerns is that of pain and distress, especially pain inflicted from stan- dard husbandry procedures. Dehorning, castration, and branding are husbandry procedures that can cause pain and discomfort. Nevertheless, these procedures are justified as management tools to minimize injuries or other problems associated with confining horned cattle and commingling of cattle. Additional guidelines out- lining veterinary oversight of these practices, other ani- mal health issues, and related institutional policies are covered elsewhere in this publication. Dystocia Management Dystocia is more prevalent in primiparous than in multiparous dams and is defined as delayed or difficult parturition. Dystocia can have serious consequences for both the dam and offspring and is typically caused by mismatched fetal-maternal size, abnormal fetal presen- tation at birth, or other maternal-related causes (Ar- nott et al., 2012; Holm et al., 2014; Funnell and Hilton, 2016). Breeding management should be structured to lessen the genetic probability of dystocia. When dys- tocia does occur, proper care and assistance at calving can decrease injury or death of both calves and dams. Parturition without complication is common in beef cows (Battaglia, 1998). Therefore, before administer- ing assistance to a cow experiencing calving difficulty, personnel should be familiar with the stages associated with approaching parturition and the signs of normal delivery. When the management system allows, females should be examined within 30 to 60 min following pre- sentation of feet, nose, or fetal membranes if delivery of the calf does not seem imminent. However, heifers or cows exhibiting signs of a malpresentation, oversized fetus, fetal anomaly, or other obvious complication should be assisted immediately.In dystocia cases where fetal presentation appears to be compromised or there seems to be a disparity be- tween the size of the fetus and the diameter of the birth canal, assistance of delivery by personnel appropriately trained in the judicious use of a fetal extractor may be attempted. In general, if more than slight traction is required on the fetal extractor, the procedure should be stopped and a veterinarian called immediately to assist the delivery or perform a caesarean section or fetotomy. Use of excessive force can damage the calf, the dam, or both, and lead to suffering or death. Strict sanitation should be used with all obstetrical procedures. Vaccinations and Drug Administration Vaccinations are a key component of any herd health program. Care should be taken to ensure the proper use, handling, and storage of vaccines and approved or investigational drugs. The preferred site of injection is the neck for either intramuscular or subcutaneous injections; however, for investigational drugs used in research, alternate sites of administration may be re- quired or preferred as dictated by the research protocol. Investigators and animal care staff should utilize best management practices associated with the use of sy- ringes and handling needles. Castration Cattle are routinely castrated to reduce aggressive- ness, prevent physical danger to other animals in the herd and to handlers, enhance reproductive control, manage genetic selection, and satisfy consumer prefer- ences regarding taste and tenderness of meat (Batta- glia, Federation of Animal Science Societies, 2010; AVMA, 2014a; Lyles and Calvo-Lorenzo, 2014). Accordingly, castration of young bulls is a necessary management practice in beef production. Several methods for castrating cattle are acceptable (AVMA, 2014a; Lyles and Calvo-Lorenzo, 2014), in- cluding surgical removal of the testicles using a knife or scalpel to open the scrotum and cutting or crushing the spermatic cords with an emasculatome or emasculator. Bloodless procedures using specialized rubber rings or surgical tubing bands (applied with specially designed instruments) are available that cause devitalization and eventual sloughing of the tissues below the ring or band. The castration method used should take into account the animal's age and weight, the skill level of the technician, environmental conditions, and facilities available as well as human and animal safety. Whatever method of castration is chosen, the procedures should be conducted by, or under the supervision of, a quali- fied, experienced person and carried out according to the castration equipment manufacturer recommenda- tions and accepted Battaglia, Guide, 4th ed. 2020Castration is normally a short-term event with a and Calvo-Lorenzo, 2014). Procedures associated with castration are normal production practices that cause short-term pain-associ- ated responses. However, these procedures are typically conducted without pain relief because of regulatory ac- cess and costs associated with practical application of drugs associated with pain relief (AVMA, 2014a; Lyles and Calvo-Lorenzo, 2014); analgesics and as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In a large meta- analysis of scientific evidence for the effects of castra- tion in male beef cattle on welfare indicators, cortisol did not differ between no castrated, surgical castration, and nonsurgical castration, and multimodal pain relief did not mitigate the cortisol increase in castrated cattle (Canozzi et al., 2017). In contrast, Nordi et al. (2019) found that knife-castrated calves experienced more acute pain than band-castrated calves, and the com- bination of flunixin plus lidocaine reduced indicators of pain. Castration is least stressful when performed at or shortly after birth. Marti et al. (2017) reported that indicators of chronic pain were not evident when calves were castrated at less than 2 mo of age, which supports the Farm Animal Welfare Council's (1981) conclusion that castration between 2 and 3 mo of age results in less stress than castration at an older age. Conversely, re- gardless of the method tested, castration caused acute pain independent of calf age (Mel\u00e9ndez et al., 2017). An increasing body of still-limited literature indicates that it is best to castrate calves as young as possible (Rob- ertson et al., 1994; Bretschneider, 2005; Marti et al., 2017). Any time that castration is performed, regard- less of method, the treated animals should be moni- tored by experienced individuals for behavioral signs of distress. Animals showing behavioral indicators of distress should be treated to reduce their discomfort. In some production settings, such as the rearing of re- placement bulls, it is impossible to castrate calves at a young age because their breeding potential has yet to be identified. Consequently, the animal welfare benefits of conducting painful production procedures, like cas- tration, need to be balanced with commercial operation goals, typical management of calves, and research and teaching needs, as documented in approved animal care protocols (Lyles and Calvo-Lorenzo, 2014). Research investigating the use of anesthesia and an- algesia during castration has yielded varying results de- pending on the metrics being evaluated (AVMA, 2014a; Lyles and Calvo-Lorenzo, 2014). Local anesthetics ad- ministered at the time of castration will provide tem- porary pain relief, whereas analgesics, such NSAIDs, provide a longer course of pain mitigation. Combining the use of local anesthetics and analgesics may pro- vide better control of acute and chronic pain (AVMA, 2014a). It may be desirable to inject a local anesthetic in the scrotum of older calves when surgical methods of castration are used or when the spermatic cords are crushed. Improved animal performance, as one poten- tial indicator of improved animal welfare, has not been observed in animals locally anesthetized at the time of castration (Ting et al., 2003; Rust et al., 2007). How- ever, all forms of castration appear to cause pain, and the degree of acute and chronic pain increases with calf age and method used (AVMA, 2014a). It should be recognized that the effect of anesthetic agents is short-lived. The need for pain mitigation approaches appear to be more justified in older animals. Castra- tion of post-pubertal bulls should be performed only by skilled individuals. When it is necessary to castrate these bulls, techniques and procedures to control bleed- ing should also be used. Bloodless procedures for cas- tration of post-pubertal bulls should be accompanied by administration of tetanus antitoxin. The possibility of infection after castration should be given additional consideration in all calves and espe- cially older animals. Infection following castration can be minimized by keeping the animals in a clean area and away from excessive mud or contaminants follow- ing the procedure until the wound is healed. If tetanus is a common disease associated with the premises, the herd health veterinarian should schedule a prophylactic tetanus immunization program. Disbudding and Dehorning Disbudding involves procedures that destroy the horn-producing cells found in the horn bud, whereas dehorning is the removal of horns after they have been formed from the horn bud (Stafford and Mellor, 2005; AVMA, 2014b). Procedures associated with disbudding and dehorning are normal production practices that cause pain (Stafford and Mellor, 2005; Stock and Calvo-Lorenzo, 2014). How- ever, these procedures are typically conducted without pain relief because of regulatory access and costs as- sociated with practical application of drugs associated with pain relief (AVMA, 2014b; Lyles and Calvo-Loren- zo, 2014). Horns on cattle can cause bruises and other injury to other animals, especially during transport and handling (AVMA, 2014b). Horns on adult cattle can also be a hazard to humans. These facts alone lead to the recommendation that naturally polled or dehorned cattle be used in teaching and research absent a strong justification for horned cattle. Disbudding and dehorning cattle in the United States is not currently regulated. The Canadian Veterinary Medical Association recommends that disbudding be performed within the first month of life (CVMA, 2016). In the United Kingdom, disbudding with a hot iron is preferred to dehorning and it is advised that this should be performed before cattle reach the age of 2 mo. In Australia, dehorning without local anesthesia or analgesia is restricted to animals less than 6 mo of age (LaFontaine and de Witte, 2002). Calves suffer less 85 CHAPTER 6: BEEF CATTLE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020pain and stress, have less risk of infection, and have better growth rates when dehorning is performed at a very young age (Newman, 2007). Stafford and Mellor (2005) found that the use of local anesthetics virtu- ally eliminated the escape behavior of calves associated with the dehorning process and that a 2-h delay was observed in the cortisol response to horn amputation. Additional disbudding and dehorning information can be found in AVMA (2014b) and in Chapter 10: Domes- tic Sheep and Goats of this guide. When horned breeds of cattle are selected, disbud- ding and dehorning should be performed under the supervision of experienced persons using proper horn buds should be removed by one of several means, such as hot cau- terizing irons, cauterizing chemicals, a sharp knife, or commercially available mechanical devices. Dehorning should be conducted at the earliest age possible, preferably before they are 2 mo old. A recent meta-analysis of 69 trials (Canozzi et al., 2018) found heterogeneity between studies for cortisol (I2 = 50.5%), average (I2 vocalization (I2 and use of non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs either separately or in combination has been found to produce heteroge- neous responses in indicators of pain/stress in disbud- ded calves that were less than 12 wk of age (Winder et al., 2018). All cattle should be monitored for hemor- rhage and infection following dehorning. Adult cattle should be dehorned if aggressive behavior is displayed toward herd-mates or humans. When it is necessary to remove horns from older cattle, it is recommended that the methods used minimize pain and bleeding and prevent infection. Dehorning may temporarily depress the growth of cattle (Loxton et al., 1982) but does not have long-term effects on production measures (AVMA, 2014b). Hornless cattle require less space in the feedlot and at the feed bunk; dehorning is a common practice in the beef industry (Battaglia, 1998; Stock et al., 2013), with calves being disbudded or dehorned either before wean- ing or upon arrival at the feedlot (Lyles and Calvo-Lo- renzo, 2014). In the event that bunk and pen space are ample (e.g., 2 times the recommended space require- ments), then tipping the horn (removing the tip only; Lyles and Calvo-Lorenzo, 2014) may be considered an alternative to minimize potential bruising or injury of pen-mates. However, Ramsay et al. (1976) reported that, after transport, carcass bruises were as common among tipped cattle as among horned ones. Identification Methods Proper animal identification is essential to research, facilitates record-keeping, and aids in the routine obser- vation and repeat identification of cattle. Methods of identification include skin color markings, visual (flap tags) or radio frequency identification (RFID) ear tags, tattooing, hot branding, freeze branding, and electronic identification. Ear tags are best used in conjunction with a more permanent form of identification such as a tattoo or brand, as ear tags are sometimes lost. Hot branding the hide has a long history of use as a means of identification and is still legally required in some localities. However, reduced value of the hide and stud- ies indicating that freeze branding is less painful than hot branding (Lay et al., 1992; Schwartzkopf-Genswein et al., 1997) have led to recommendations to consider alternatives when possible. Skin and hair color, in ad- dition to limited access to liquid nitrogen or dry ice in extensive range operations, may affect the ability to achieve a quality freeze brand. Both hot branding and freeze branding should be performed by trained personnel to minimize skin contact with the branding device to only that required to achieve a useful brand. Additional information on branding can be found in the AVMA (2011) and in Lyles and Calvo-Lorenzo (2014). Implanting Implanting of cattle is a management practice to ad- minister growth promotants and potentially as a means to deliver investigational compounds used in research. For proper absorption and maximum response, implants should be placed correctly and in the correct location. Traditionally, implants are placed beneath the skin on the back side of the middle third of the ear; however, al- ternate implantation sites may be required as designat- ed by the research protocol. Proper disinfection of the implant site should prevent infection. Care should be taken not to injure major blood vessels or the cartilage of the ear when implanting in the ear location. Utiliza- tion of best management practices associated with the use of the implant device and correct needle-handling procedures are required by suitably trained personnel. ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT Refer to Chapter 4: Environmental Enrichment in this publication for information on enrichment of envi- ronments for beef cattle. HANDLING AND TRANSPORT Refer to the Chapter 5: Animal Handling and Trans- port in this publication for information on handling and transportation of beef cattle. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS Intensive Laboratory Facilities Some research and teaching situations require that beef cattle be housed under intensive laboratory condi- tions. Cattle may be kept in metabolism stalls, stan-86 CHAPTER 6: BEEF CATTLE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020chions, respiration chambers, or environmental cham- bers. Housing cattle in such facilities should be avoided unless required by the experimental protocol (e.g., com- plete urine or fecal collection, long or short-term infu- sion studies, frequent sampling, or environmental con- trol) and then should be for the minimum amount of time necessary to accomplish the teaching or research objective. Cattle that are held or penned temporar- ily in crowded areas, frequently disturbed, come into close contact with humans, or are exposed to unfamil- iar conditions or laboratory/teaching settings should have calm dispositions and be adapted to frequent con- tact with animal care personnel and to conditions that could result in the animal having an adverse reaction. In some cases, it may be advantageous to train such animals to a halter. Time spent preparing cattle for use in a laboratory improves the quality of research and the safety of both the animals and humans. Cattle should not be housed in isolation unless approved by the ani- mal care and use committee for specific experimental requirements. Whenever possible, cattle should be able to maintain visual contact with others. Unless the ex- perimental protocol has special requirements for light- ing, all animal rooms should be designed to minimize variations in light intensity and provide for a normal light/dark cycle. Excreta should be removed from enclosed laborato- ries at least once daily. Pens or stalls should be washed thoroughly at the beginning of every trial. If excreta or other foreign materials such as wasted feed cannot be adequately removed through daily cleaning, additional washing may be needed during a trial. The method of collection of feces and urine from cattle in metabolism stalls, stanchions, and chambers depends on the design and construction of the unit. Additional management may be needed to keep animals clean when they are housed in stalls or stanchions. Cattle may need to be washed and curried regularly to maintain cleanliness and to avoid fly infestations. Pens, stalls, and stan- chions should be large enough to allow cattle to stand up or lie down without difficulty and should be long enough to allow cattle to maintain a normal standing position. Cattle maintained in some laboratory environments have their activity restricted more than cattle in pro- duction settings. The length of time that cattle may remain in stanchions, metabolism stalls, or environ- mental chambers before removal to a pen or outside lot for additional exercise should be no longer than that necessary for conducting the study. Opportuni- ties for regular exercise should be considered if they do not disrupt the experimental protocol; care must be taken in moving animals from the laboratory to the outside environment for exercise when a large tem- perature differential exists. If cattle are to be housed in such laboratory environments for more than 3 wk, particular attention should be given to the alertness of the animal; appetite; fecal and urinary outputs; and condition of the feet, legs, and hock joints. Rubber mats or suitable alternatives may be used to increase the comfort of cattle maintained for lengthy periods on hard surfaces. Transgenics and Cloning Refer to Chapter 1: Institutional Policies for infor- mation on transgenesis and cloning as they relate to animal care and use. SLAUGHTER AND EUTHANASIA Floors of livestock pens, ramps, and driveways of har- vest facilities shall be constructed and maintained so as to provide good footing for livestock (USDA-FSIS, 2006). Animals shall have access to water in all hold- ing pens and, if held longer than 24 h, access to feed. Additionally, for animals held overnight there shall be sufficient room in the holding pens for the animals to lie down (USDA-FSIS, 2006). Protocols for slaughter should follow the AVMA Guidelines for the Humane Slaughter of Animals (AVMA, 2016, or current). The AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia (AVMA, 2020, or current) lists several methods of euthanasia that are appropriate for ruminants. Intravenous administration of barbiturates, potassium chloride used in conjunction with general anesthesia, and penetrating captive bolt followed by exsanguination are acceptable means of euthanasia in all cases. Other conditionally acceptable methods include intravenous administration of chloral hydrate (following sedation), gunshot to the head, and electrocution. In all cases, euthanasia should only be performed by trained individuals. Agents that result in tissue residues cannot be used for the euthanasia of ruminants intended for human or animal food unless those agents are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Carbon dioxide is the only chemical currently used in euthanasia of food animals (primarily swine) that does not lead to tissue residues. Use of carbon dioxide is generally not recom- mended for euthanasia of larger animals. The carcasses of animals euthanized by barbiturates may contain po- tentially harmful residues, and such carcasses should be disposed of in a manner that prevents them from being consumed by humans or animals. Incurably ill or injured animals in chronic pain or distress should be humanely euthanized as soon as they are diagnosed as such and according to AVMA (2020) recommend- ed procedures. Their disposal should be accomplished promptly by a commercial rendering service or other means (e.g., burial/landfill, composting, or incinera- tion) according to applicable ordinances and regula- tions. More information on slaughter and euthanasia is found in Chapter 2: Agricultural Animal Health Care of this publication. In the United States, all procedures used to slaugh- ter research and teaching animals that will enter the food chain must comply with US Code of Federal Reg-87 CHAPTER 6: BEEF CATTLE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020ulations, Title 7, Chapter 48, Humane Slaughter of Livestock (https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/US- CODE-2011-title7/pdf/USCODE-2011-title7-chap48. pdf). The North American Meat Institute (NAMI) has embraced guidelines (https://animalhandling.org/pro- ducers/guidelines_audits) that exceed the regulatory requirements (Grandin, 2017) and the NAMI guide- lines (NAMI, 2019) are incorporated here by reference.

The fo- cus is to provide the necessary information required for those responsible for the design, maintenance, and management of dairy cattle research facilities and those who are responsible for serving on an institutional ani- mal care and use committee (IACUC) and charged with ensuring that animals kept in such facilities are well cared for, so that the highest standards of animal welfare are met and maintained. Specific recommendations are required within a framework that provide housing and management flexi- bility but that specifically address key welfare concerns. We will therefore take the approach of providing recom- mendations within each section, based upon the life- cycle of the cow, beginning with the milk-fed calf, the growing heifer stages, through lactating, dry, materni- ty, and special needs cattle housing and added consid- erations for dairy bulls. We will provide outcome-based measures for evaluating key elements, when possible. FACILITIES AND ENVIRONMENT Milk-Fed Calf Whatever the end use of the calf, whether it be for veal production, heifer replacement, or otherwise, the standards for care discussed herein are best practices. Calves should be kept in full social contact with at least one other calf for the majority of the milk-feed- ing period. In the United States, milk-fed calves are typically housed individually (on 75% of operations), but group housing is becoming increasingly common (USDA, 2016), and providing social contact (tactile, auditory, visual) is supported by many scientific stud- ies. Individually reared milk-fed calves exhibit deficient social skills, poor learning abilities, and difficulties in coping with new situations, all of which may reduce the animal's ability to adapt effectively to the variable environments experienced as an adult (see review by Costa et al., 2016). Calves housed individually or with only limited auditory or visual contact were more fear- ful than pair-housed calves (Jensen and Larsen, 2014). Calves have also been shown to work to gain access to full social contact with a known calf even when al- ready provided limited social contact across a barrier (Holm et al., 2002; Estevez et al., 2007), indicating that they are motivated to be with other cattle. Providing full social contact with peers during the milk-feeding period has been shown to provide numerous benefits, including reduced fearfulness (B\u00f8e and Faerevik, 2003), reduced food neophobia (Costa et al., 2015), increased starter intake, reduced weaning distress, and reduced growth check during regrouping (de Paula Vieira et al., 2010). The results of this latter study also illustrated longer-term costs to housing calves individually. When weaned, calves that had previously been housed indi- vidually took 50 h to begin feeding, on average, com- pared with just 9 h for pair-reared calves. While calves are being fed milk or milk replacer, all housing should provide a spatial allowance of at least 2.8 m2 (30 ft2) or more of bedded space per calf (not including service alleys) to minimize the risk of respira- tory disease (Lago et al., 2006). This space allowance should allow the calf to turn around and select a com- fortable resting space based upon preference for differ- ent microenvironments within the pen. Calves groom diverse parts of the body beginning at a very young age (Chua et al., 2002) and restriction of movement, espe- cially the ability to turn around, decreases their ability to perform natural behaviors when space allowance is compromised (Le Neindre, 1993). Based on the need for socialization and the ability to groom and turn around, tethers that restrict these behaviors should not be used for calves. Dairy calves should be provided a clean, dry, soft place to lie down. Dairy calves show aversion to lying on concrete surfaces and a clear preference for drier sawdust bedding (Camiloti et al., 2012). Calves benefit from deep bedding, especially in temperatures less than 10\u00b0C (50\u00b0F), for example, with deep, dry clean straw (Lago et al., 2006; Hill et al., 2011). A drainage sys- tem installed below the bedding is beneficial to remove moisture and minimize the need for fresh bedding. In warmer climates, shavings, sand, or other materials can be an acceptable bedding alternative. Wooden or met-CHAPTER 7: DAIRY CATTLE 92al slats, tenderfoot flooring, rocks, and bare concrete should not be used as the only resting area. Multiple, smaller group pens that allow for \"all-in, all-out\" groupings, which enable complete cleaning and downtime between uses, are recommended. Calves should be provided adequate ventilation and protection from inclement weather. Provision of adequate ventilation minimizes the risk of respira- tory disease, and control of the thermal environment is required to prevent chilling in newborn calves and heat stress during hot weather. The use of a calf jacket does not preclude other measures necessary to ensure thermal comfort in cold weather (such as heating and increased feeding rate), in part because only a single study has evaluated this option (Earley et al., 2004). Provision of a heat lamp has been reported to provide benefits during the first day of life (Uystepruyst et al., 2002), and milk-fed calves show a preference for heated areas, regardless of milk-feeding level, and tend to be closest to the heat lamp in colder temperatures than in warmer temperatures (Borderas et al., 2009). Care is needed to ensure that heat lamps do not impose a fire risk when used. Calves should be provided protection from heat, and should be provided shade. Heat stress can be monitored by evaluating respiration rates and panting. Although hutches have long been considered a gold standard in calf rearing, attention to heat stress should be provided in hot weather because temperatures within the hutch can exceed ambient conditions and air quality can be poor (Hill et al., 2011). Indeed, Hill et al. (2011) found that a well-ventilated nursery barn with straw bedding resulted in improved average daily gains (ADG) over hutches. Positive pressure tube ventilation systems can ensure a minimum of 4 air changes per hour (ACH) year round and have been reported to be associated with benefits to calf health (Jorgensen et al., 2017). In hot weather, shade and supplementary cooling with additional fans can lower respiratory rates and improve ADG (Hill et al., 2011). Growing Heifers Growing heifers fall in an age category that covers the period after milk feeding ends but before lactation be-gins. Heifers should be provided a clean, dry, soft lying area of sufficient size (see Table 7-1 later in the chapter for recommended dimensions). After weaning, heifers are often housed on bedded packs or pasture or moved to freestall housing. In the days following introduction into the freestall, many heifers also lie in the alley (von Keyserlingk et al., 2011), leading to an increased risk of developing intramammary infections (Breen et al., 2009). Monitoring animal hygiene is a way to assess the dryness and cleanliness of the lying area, regardless of the housing type used. Heifers should be scored for hygiene as part of routine management. For descrip- tions of hygiene scoring systems, please visit http:// www.paacodairywelfareauditortraining.com/. Lactating and Dry Dairy Cows Housing should provide protection from the weather (extremes of temperature and precipitation), while giv- ing cows the freedom to eat, drink, and rest to maintain health and productivity with minimal risk for injury. Lactating and dry adult dairy cattle may be managed at pasture or on dry lots, or be housed in tiestall barns, freestalls, or in loose housing or bedded pack facilities. Primary Housing Stanchions, the yoke that confines the cow to a stall and limits her movement, should not be used for hous- ing. The lack of freedom of the animal to rest with its head pulled back alongside its flank (\"the closed posi- tion\"), the compromised ability to lunge forward when rising to a standing position (\"lunge space\") caused by the yoke, a limited ability to groom the back of its body, and the associated risk for injury to the scapula anecdotally associated with stanchions mean that they should not be used for daily housing of adult dairy cat- tle (Tie-stall Task Force, National Milk Producers Fed- eration, 2018). Indeed, there are negative consequences of limited opportunities to rest and sleep with the head supported (Kull et al., 2019; Ternman et al., 2019). Tiestall housing should be designed to provide suf- ficient space for the resting imprint of cows of different sizes and room for the milker to attach the milking unit if the cow is milked in the stall (see Table 7-2). A tether Table 7-1.

Access to the water cup should be unencumbered within 61 cm (24 in) of the top lip of the cup. Although tiestall housing carries with it some bene- fits to the cow, including less competition for a place to rest, feed, and drink; provision of a controlled thermal environment; and improved detection of the sick, there is growing concern regarding the negative effect of a lack of behavioral freedom associated with tethering (Spooner et al., 2014) and use of electric cow trainers to position the cow. Electric cow trainers should not touch the cow while she stands in a normal position. There is evidence that cattle find electric shock aversive (Pajor et al., 2000). The purpose of electric cow trainers is to reduce the amount of manure in the last one-third of the stall (Bergsten and Pettersson, 1992). Some work has iden- tified the use of electric cow trainers as a risk factor for hock (Zurbrigg et al., 2005) and soft tissue injuries (Busato et al., 2000). Tied cattle should be provided a period of daily un- tethered exercise. This approach has support from the scientific literature with benefits including less risk of lameness (Popescu et al., 2013), less risk of hock in- jury (Gustafson et al., 1993; Keil et al., 2006), reduced risk of illness (Gustafson et al., 1993), improved abil- ity to groom (Krohn, 1994; Loberg et al., 2004), and improved socialization and movement (Veissier et al., 2008).Freestall facilities are rapidly becoming the dominant form of adult cattle housing globally. These barns con- sist of multiple pens of stalls connected to a holding area and milking parlor or an automated milking sys- tem (AMS), with a feed bunk along which feed is de- livered and to which cows have direct access. Cows are free to move between the resting, feeding, and drinking areas of the pen and, in some facilities, cows have ac- cess to outside lots (Brotzman et al., 2015). Freestall pens can be designed with between 1 and 4 rows of stalls per feed bunk, with 2- or 3-row pens being the most common. Feed space per cow depends on the pen stocking rate and the pen layout, with feed space being typically ~75 cm (30 in) per cow in 2-row pens and ~45 cm (18 in) per cow in 3-row pens. To reduce feeding competition and optimize feed access, 2-row pens are preferred (see review by Cook, 2019). There is also evidence that the use of headlocks or dividers where cows place their heads through a structure that they can enter and leave freely or that can be locked to restrain them, rather than a post-and-rail feed bunk, reduces competition and displacements from the bunk (Endres et al., 2005). Headlocks facilitate management tasks involving handling of cattle within the pen, such as the administration of vaccinations. It is recommended that heifers be trained to use headlocks to access feed, necessitating prior exposure before moving cattle into pens with this type of feed access at critical periods, such as the close-up pen be- fore calving. It is also recommended that adult dairy cattle have access to at least 1 headgate/cow or 61 Table 7-2.

Whether headlocks or a post-and-rail bunk design are used, the recommended industry standard for effective throat height (the distance from the standing surface to the point where the cow's throat would be when eating) for adult Holstein dairy cattle is 53 to 58 cm (21 to 23 in) and for Jerseys 46 to 48 cm (18 to 19 in). Ideally, the headlocks are angled forward slightly to improve access to feed. Because waterers in freestall barns are typically pro- vided in the areas (\"crossovers\") between the stall alley and feed alley, the number of stalls between crossovers is limited to a maximum of 25 in best practice, with accessible water trough perimeter recommended to be 8 to 9 cm (3 to 3.5 in) per cow and a minimum of 2 wa- terers per group for group sizes larger than ~10 cows. A minimum of 3.7 m (12 ft) of space around the water- ers allows for one or more cows to drink, with room for cows to pass through the crossover without disturbance. Placement of water troughs in the return lanes from the milking parlor can also provide additional sources for cows to meet their requirements for daily water intake. This information is based on industry best practice, as no scientific evidence exists that evaluates water alloca- tion and placement. Dairy cattle freestalls should be stocked at 1:1 animal:stall or less. An abundance of research has shown a reduction in lying time when cows compete for access to a lying space (Fregonesi et al., 2007a; Krawc- zel et al., 2008, 2012; Hill et al., 2009; Winckler et al., 2015). The time out of the pen each day for milking should not exceed 3 h/d. Pen group sizes can affect time out of the pen milking. Freestall cow time budgets dem- onstrate that increased time milking leads to reduced lying times (Gomez and Cook, 2010), a risk factor for lameness. Freestalls should be sized to accommodate the rest- ing imprint of the cow and provide for sufficient lunge space to ensure normal rising and lying movements. Recommendations based on estimated body weight (BW) are provided in Table 7-3 based on The Dairy- land Initiative (https://thedairylandinitiative.vetmed. wisc.edu). Cows should be provided a clean, dry, soft lying area of appropriate size. Mats, mattresses, waterbeds, or concrete, even when supplemented with less than 8 cm (3 in) of bedding, should not be used. Injuries, swelling, and hair loss on the legs of lactating and dry cows should be evaluated regularly to evaluate the soft- ness of the lying area. Common scoring systems are described at http://www.paacodairywelfareauditor- training.com/. The prevalence of severe hock and knee injuries should be 1% (Barrientos et al., 2013; Cook et al., 2016; Cook, 2018). The hygiene of the animals should be assessed regularly to evaluate the dryness of the lying area.An essential element of tiestall and freestall design to ensure optimal lying times is the stall surface. Cat- tle show clear preferences for soft and dry lying areas (Tucker et al., 2003; Fregonesi et al., 2007b; Reich et al., 2010), and lying time is reduced on concrete (Haley et al., 2000) and wet surfaces (Fregonesi et al., 2007b). Unyielding and poorly bedded lying surfaces, such as mattresses or mats, are a key risk factor for leg inju- ries; namely swelling, open wounds, and hair loss on the hock and knees (Barrientos et al., 2013; Zaffino Heyerhoff et al., 2014). Mattresses are associated with higher rates of lameness compared with deep-bedded sand (Espejo and Endres, 2007), whereas deep bed- ding is a protective factor for lameness in geographical regions with high levels of lameness (Chapinal et al., 2013, 2014). Mattresses covered in enough bedding may function in a manner similar to deep sand or other soft materials, but maintaining coverage and depth is key. For example, lying times are compromised on lightly bedded mattresses compared with deeply bedded ones (Tucker and Weary, 2004), and cattle show a strong preference for deep-bedded lying areas over mattresses (Tucker et al., 2003). Poor stall design, either freestalls or tiestalls, can be detected by leg health. Stalls that are too small result in hair loss, abrasions, and swelling on the legs (reviewed by Kester et al., 2014). Whatever surface or bedding material is used, con- taminated bedding should be removed from the stall each milking or at least once per day and fresh dry bed- ding should be applied at a frequency to keep the beds level, comfortable, and clean. Loose housing or bedded packs are commonly used to house sub-groups of adult cows or entire herds. Bed- ded packs may be managed aerobically or anaerobi- cally, but the key requirement for animal welfare is that cows should be provided enough space per animal (Table 7-1) and that the bedding should be soft and dry. In some systems, anaerobic beds use straw added daily to a bed, which accumulates in layers over a pe- riod of 4 to 6 wk before removal and replacement. The layers compact, become moist, and decompose, remov- ing oxygen from the bed and leading to an anaerobic fermentation. Aerobic beds or \"compost beds\" use fine bedding material such as dry wood sawdust and are composted by stirring twice a day to a depth of 20 to 30 cm (8 to 12 in), with the aim of generating a mini- mum temperature of 60\u00b0C (140\u00b0F), which is sufficient to inactivate bacterial pathogens, weed seeds, and fly larvae. Moisture levels are maintained between 40 and 65% in best practice. Typically, a concrete feed alley or an area where trucks drive and deliver feed that cows access through a feed barrier (see headlocks and post- and-rail above) is 3.7 to 4.3 m (12 to 14 ft) wide and is connected to a bedded area no deeper than 9 to 11 m (30 to 35 ft) with sufficient area to accommodate cows of different sizes. Space allocation for bedded areas has received little attention in adult dairy cows. A single study investigating the effects of space allowance found that cows spent more time lying when more space was 95 CHAPTER 7: DAIRY CATTLE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020Table 7-3.

Aggressive behavior and interruptions of lying behavior decline when more space is provided (Sch\u00fctz et al., 2015). Pasture and dry-lot systems are also used to house lactating cows. The animal-based measures recom- mended throughout this chapter (body condition, hy- giene, locomotion, leg injuries, respiration rate) serve as outcome-based indicators of welfare, and in combina- tion with the facility-based measures for all lactating cows (space allocation, lying area requirements, shade, heat abatement, protection from inclement weather), cover the key recommendations for these 2 housing sys- tems. Thermal Environment The thermoneutral zone of mature dairy cattle rang- es from 5 to 25\u00b0C (40-77\u00b0F) (depending on humidity), and within these temperatures cattle generate basal levels of metabolic heat (Kadzere et al., 2002). The thermoneutral zone of cattle depends on breed, dry matter intake (DMI), ration composition, milk produc- tion, housing and management, body condition, and behavior. Therefore, although adult cattle are relatively tolerant of cold temperatures, they are susceptible to heat stress and show early signs of this even within the upper range of the thermoneutral zone. When dairy cows accumulate heat load, production, health and welfare problems result, including increased body tem- perature, decreased milk yield (Wheelock et al., 2010) and fertility (de Rensis and Scaramuzzi, 2003), and, in extreme cases, mortality (Stull et al., 2008; Morignat et al., 2014). Cows under increased heat load alter their behavior in an attempt to improve cooling. They spend more time standing and less time lying (Cook et al., 2007; Allen et al., 2015). Several studies examining the ly- ing time of cows in freestalls report a range of 11 to 14 h (Cook et al., 2004; Jensen et al., 2005; Ito et al., 2010) under thermoneutral conditions, with a 30% re- duction when ambient temperatures increase (Cook et al., 2007). Extended periods of prolonged standing are a major risk factor for lameness (Cook and Nordlund, 2009; Allen et al., 2015), which may also be associated with painful experiences (Flower et al., 2008). Similar risks from heat stress are present for the growing heifer. Although research to evaluate their response is lacking, it is expected that they will respond in a similar man- ner to adult cattle. Cattle should be provided shade and other forms of heat abatement (soakers, fans) in warm conditions. The effectiveness of heat abatement should be evaluated dur- ing afternoons of summer months on a regular basis. During these evaluations, when the temperature exceeds 23\u00b0C (73\u00b0F; temperature-humidity index = 68), no cattle should be panting, and respiration rates should be below 70 to 80 breaths/min (Tresoldi et al., 2017). Additional cooling may be provided, most commonly through the use of fans to create localized areas of fast-moving air and through the use of water, either to mist and cool the air before it reaches the cow or to soak the cow directly. Fans improve heat loss and are of- ten provided in combination with soakers (West, 2003). Compared with shade alone, soakers reduce body tem- perature, respiration rate, and localized air tempera- ture (Kendall et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2013). Cows show a clear preference to feed from bunks with soakers and increase feeding time when fed from bunks with soakers compared with those without in summer (Chen et al., 2013). Providing cows access to soakers in hot conditions and having a nutritionist balance rations is associated with a lower percentage of thin cows (Adams et al., 2017). Cattle should be provided protection in cold weather. In cold weather, cattle will use artificial windbreaks (Olson and Wallander, 2002) and shelters that provide protection from rain (Vandenheede et al., 1995). Cat- tle will use conspecifics for protection (Graunke et al., 2011) and will position themselves toward the sun in cold weather (Gonyou and Stricklin, 1981). Although most of the evidence about the use of windbreaks and response to cold weather comes from research in beef cattle, similar benefits of protection likely also apply to dairy animals, with housing typically being provided for protection from the elements. In cold weather, fa- cilities ventilate enough to ensure that noxious gases such as ammonia are removed from the barn, and the provision of fresh air minimizes the risk for pneumonia while air exchange is controlled to prevent freezing. As the temperature increases, increasing the ventilation rate removes moisture and heat until a maximum ven- tilation rate is achieved either using natural ventilation principles or mechanical assistance. Minimal air ex- change rates of 4 ACH are suggested for cold weather, increasing to 40 to 60 ACH in hot weather (Yeck and Stewart, 1959). Holding Areas Holding areas have been identified as a particular area for heat stress control in lactating cow facilities (Collier et al., 2006) as cows are commingled closely in a small area. Supplementary fans and soaking are recommended to provide additional cooling in this area and have been widely adopted in freestall herds (Cook et al., 2016). Space allowance in the holding area is also important, but recommendations have not received sci- entific scrutiny. Currently, 1.86 m2 (20 ft2) per cow is proposed as a minimum space allocation. Specific Considerations: Transition Period The transition period, typically defined from 21 d before to 21 d after calving is a particularly challenging period for the cow, marking the end of gestation, birth of the calf, and commencement of lactation. For man- agement and feeding purposes, it is typical to create 1 or 2 separate groups of dry (nonlactating) cows before 97 CHAPTER 7: DAIRY CATTLE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020cows are moved to a maternity pen to calve. This allows specific diets to be fed during this period. After calving, the parturient cow is normally segre- gated from the main herd while colostrum is collected and antibiotic withholding periods are observed, after which the cow is moved either to a lactating cow pen with herd-mates or to a dedicated fresh cow pen, typi- cally for 14 to 30 d, where cows may be easily surveyed for signs of ill health and a specific diet may be fed. Although moving cows between different groups aids management for the delivery of different diets, it can negatively affect behavior. Regrouping groups of cows triggers a period of unrest for approximately 72 h, dur- ing which regrouped cows are subjected to 2.5 times as many aggressive interactions compared with before regrouping, which also negatively affected milk produc- tion (von Keyserlingk et al., 2008). Schirmann et al. (2011) demonstrated a 9% decrease in DMI in cows moved into the pen during the transition period. More- over, cows that were moved also reduced their intake and number of lying bouts and were more aggressive at the feeder (Schirmann et al., 2011). The latter study also showed that cows already present in the pen into which new cows are mixed also had decreased feeding rate and rumination time. It is recommended that efforts be made to minimize regrouping stress during the period 21 d before calving as reduced DMI during the prefresh period has been shown to foreshadow metabolic and other peripartu- rient diseases et al., 2007; DeVries, 2019). Talebi et al. (2014) showed that the effects of regrouping can be lessened by avoiding over- stocking, emphasizing the importance of ensuring suf- ficient space for cows to rest without competition and enough bunk space for all of the cows to eat at the same time during this critical transition period [75 cm (30 in) per cow] to ensure optimal DMI (Huzzey et al., 2006). The negative effects associated with aggressive interac- tions can be mitigated through the use of headlocks (Huzzey et al., 2006) or feed stalls (DeVries and von Keyserlingk, 2006). Historically, little scientific work has focused on the special needs of cows on and around the day of calv- ing. In the hours before and during labor, cows become restless, which is often characterized by a dramatic increase in position changes between standing and ly- ing (Huzzey et al., 2005; Miedema et al., 2011; Jensen, 2012), thus the type of flooring in the maternity pen is important. Some recent work investigated the effects of different standing and lying surfaces (rubber, deep sand, and concrete, all covered with a fresh layer of straw) in the calving pen. Cows demonstrated a pref- erence for a softer bed and avoided rubber flooring in the maternity pen (Campler et al., 2014). A series of recent studies found that, in addition to seeking an ap- propriate surface, cows also seek some visual isolation from pen-mates at the time of calving; cows preferred to calve in an area within the maternity pen that al-lowed for visual isolation, particularly during the night- time hours (Proudfoot et al., 2014). Maternity pens may be designed as either group or individual pens and should provide a minimum of 9.3 m2 (100 ft2) of bedded area/cow. Group or individual pens should be positioned to emphasize a quiet, stress- free calving location away from high traffic areas on the farm (Proudfoot, 2019). It is recommended that individual pens have a catch gate to hold the cow and be large enough to allow space behind her if she needs calving assistance. Dimensions of 3.7 m \u00d7 3.7 m (12 ft \u00d7 12 ft) or 3.7 m \u00d7 4.3 m (12 ft \u00d7 14 ft) are common. Specific Considerations: Housing for Sick Animals Hospital and sick pens should be in quiet areas that provide some opportunity for cows to hide from others if they choose. Sick cows are potential sources of infec- tious agents (e.g., Salmonella, Mycoplasma, Staphylo- coccus aureus) to naive herd-mates, and treated cows may have antibiotic residues in meat and milk, requir- ing segregation of the milk from the bulk tank. It is therefore common to group cows with milk residues separate from healthy untreated cows and it is prudent to attempt isolation of the sick cow from the rest of the herd. Interestingly, cows will seek isolation (e.g., lying in a secluded corner of a pen) if given the opportunity when ill (Proudfoot et al., 2014). In addition to their motivation to avoid other cows during this vulnerable time, dedicated sick pens provide the opportunity for caregivers to frequently monitor at-risk animals and those undergoing treatment. Sick cows are also less likely to compete well for access to the feeding area (Huzzey et al., 2007; Goldhawk et al., 2009), making a separate pen located away from the main herd a recom- mended strategy. Lame cows benefit from being segregated to a sepa- rate bedded pack pen close to the milking center, with ready access to feed and water and reduced competi- tion from sound cows (Thomsen et al., 2019). Bulls For space requirements, use body weight, as appro- priate, as shown in Table 7-3. See also Chapter 6: Beef Cattle for guidelines about facilities for bulls. FEED AND WATER All cattle must be provided access to clean water from birth. Water requirements are affected by many factors, including environmental temperature, diet (particularly ration dry matter and sodium content), milk production level, and age (National Research Council, 2001). For example, a healthy high-producing lactating cow 2 to 3 wk into her lactation can consume 98 CHAPTER 7: DAIRY CATTLE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020in excess of 75 L (20 gal) of water per day (Huzzey et al., 2007). Water should be clean, fresh, and potable. Willms et al. (2002) reported that when cattle were provided a choice of freshwater or water contaminated with even 0.005% fresh manure by weight, they avoided the contaminated water. If water contains compounds that diminish palatability, cattle will reduce their water consumption (Grout et al., 2006) or seek alternative sources (Digesti and Weeth, 1976). For calves and non- ambulatory animals, water may be offered at several points throughout the day if freezing weather or cows knocking waterers over is a problem. Milk-Fed Calf Colostrum. Bull and heifer calves should be provided colostrum. Colostrum management is one of the most critical areas of calf care and it has an important effect on the health and welfare of calves (Beam et al., 2009; Vogels et al., 2013). Despite its importance, surveys continue to report that large numbers of dairy calves in the United States still receive either inadequate or marginal levels of colostrum; 15% of farms tested co- lostrum quality and only 6% routinely screened for fail- ure of passive transfer (FPT; USDA, 2016). Colostrum contains antibodies known as immunoglobulins, large glycoprotein molecules that constitute the main protec- tion against diseases during the milk-fed period. The immunoglobulins contained in colostrum are absorbed into the calf's blood (a process called \"passive trans- fer\"). The immunoglobulins obtained in this way pro- tect the calf until its own immune system becomes fully functional at around 3 to 6 wk of age (Nagahata et al., 1991). Thus, FPT is a low concentration of circulating immunoglobulin (IgG <10.0 g/L) in the blood of the calf as a result of inadequate colostrum intake (Mc- Guirk and Collins, 2004) and it is a welfare concern. The ability of the calf to defend itself against infec- tious diseases is directly related to the amount (vol- ume), quality (immunoglobulin level and hygiene), and timing of colostrum intake. Several studies have docu- mented the close association between inadequate co- lostrum intake, FPT, and increased mortality or mor- bidity of calves (Rea et al., 1996; Filteau et al., 2003; Dewell et al., 2006). According to Wells et al. (1996), 31% of calf deaths during the first 3 wk of life could have been prevented if colostrum feeding had been ad- equate. Even when death is avoided, there can be long- term effects of inadequate colostrum intake; calves with FPT have been reported to have lower BW 6 mo later (Dewell et al., 2006). Recommended best practices to prevent FPT include feeding a minimum of 4 L (4.2 qt) of high-quality co- lostrum within 6 h of calving (Godden, 2008) by vol- untary or assisted means. Passive transfer of immunity following colostrum feeding can be assessed using the radial immunodiffusion technique, considered the gold standard for assessing blood serum IgG concentrations. However, a more practical method is the quantification of serum total protein using a refractometer that has been shown to be highly correlated with IgG concentra- tions (Deelen et al., for FPT using a refractometer are <5.2 g/dL serum total protein in calves (equivalent 1 g/dL serum IgG; Tyler et al., 1996; Windeyer et al., 2014), although Godden et al. (2019) has a more detailed list of proposed recommendations to consider ranging from excellent (>6.2 g of serum total protein dL) to poor (<5.1 g of serum total protein/dL). Recent work suggests that calves may be reliably tested for passive transfer of immunity using IgG or serum total protein concentrations up to 9 d of age (Wilm et al., 2018). Milk Feeding. Calves should be fed to maintain a growth rate of 0.82 kg/d (1.8 lb/d) on average (excel- lent growth; Shivley et al., 2018). If it is not feasible to measure growth rate, body condition score can serve as a proxy and, in this case, calves should be in good con- dition, not thin or emaciated. For descriptions of body condition scoring systems, please visit http://www. paacodairywelfareauditortraining.com/. Calves are highly motivated to suck and should be fed through a teat or nipple during the milk-feeding period. During the early life period, solid feed intake is very low in calves, regardless of the amount of milk or starter provided (see review by Khan et al., 2011b). Calves benefit especially from higher intakes of milk or milk replacer during the first 4 wk of life when their ability to digest solid feed is limited. Benefits of im- proved growth and reduced hunger can be achieved by feeding calves higher rates of milk or milk replacer equivalent (reviewed by Khan et al., 2011b). Calves are motivated to consume large amounts of milk or milk replacer equivalent. For example, Holstein calves will drink in excess of 9.5 L/d (10 qt/d; Rosenberger et al., 2017). Feeding higher milk allowances results in weight gain advantages before and after weaning and reduces the numbers of unrewarded visits to automated milk feeders, an indication of persistent hunger (Rosenberg- er et al., 2017). Moreover, limit feeding (10% of BW equivalent or approximately 3.7 L/d or 3.9 qt/d of milk or milk replacer) does not allow the calf to meet its nutritional requirements for maintenance, growth, and development, and there is strong evidence that limit feeding causes hunger (De Paula Vieira et al., 2008). There are no known negative side effects of feeding more milk or milk replacer; indeed, there are long-term benefits such as an earlier breeding age and higher milk yield later in life (Soberon et al., 2012; Soberon and Van Amburgh, 2013). If given the opportunity, calves will spend on average 45 min/d suckling; thus, deliver- ing larger amounts of milk [7.6 L/d (8 qt/d) or more in 2 or more feedings per day] via nipple feeding is more natural and results in higher concentrations of digestive hormones such as cholecystokinin and insulin (Appleby et al., 2001). Moreover, nipple-feeding higher volumes of milk (that prevent hunger) is associated with a lower incidence of the abnormal behavior of cross sucking (de 99 CHAPTER 7: DAIRY CATTLE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020Passill\u00e9 et al., 2010; Costa et al., 2016). Higher milk intakes are not associated with increased diarrhea or other health problems (Borderas et al., 2009). Calves should be provided access to forage, such as hay, from birth in addition to starter (Khan et al., 2016). This reduces nonnutritive sucking and promotes both species-typical feeding patterns and rumen devel- opment (Webb et al., 2013). Providing forage to calves during the milk-feeding period has historically been discouraged, because forage is less energy dense and believed to displace concentrate intake, thereby shifting rumen fermentation in favor of acetate and potentially delaying differentiation of the rumen papillae (Tamate et al., 1962). Indeed, inclusion of forage in the diet dur- ing the milk-fed period results in poorer BW gains in calves fed restricted and low quantities of milk (e.g., 3.7 L/d or 3.9 qt/d; Kertz et al., 1979). However, recent work suggests that forage may play a role during the transition from milk to solid feed intake in calves pro- vided higher milk rations (e.g., 8 L/d or 8.4 qt/d) (see review by Khan et al., 2016). For instance, providing chopped hay to calves fed 7.6 L or 8 qt/d resulted in higher solid feed intake and improved rumen develop- ment without negatively affecting BW gain (Khan et al., 2011a). Cross sucking is an undesirable behavior performed in group-housed calves. A combination of slower milk flow, feeding hay, and access to a nonnutritive artificial teat are recommended to reduce cross sucking (de Pas- sill\u00e9, 2001). Providing additional objects for oral ma- nipulation, such as tires, has also been shown to reduce other problems, such as stereotypic tongue rolling in calves (Veissier et al., 1997). Weaning. Calves should be weaned gradually. At weaning, the dairy calf transitions from milk to solid feed. Under natural conditions, the weaning process normally involves a gradual reduction in milk intake, accompanied by decline in social dependence from the dam and increasing intake of solid food (Weary et al., 2008). It is commonly thought that feeding less milk will encourage solid feed intake and thus facilitate wean- ing. Indeed, feeding calves less milk does increase start- er consumption, but this practice also severely limits weight gains (reviewed by Khan et al., 2011b). To date, little information is available on how best to wean rap- idly growing calves fed high milk rations. There is some evidence that slowly reducing milk intake in the days before weaning can be helpful (Khan et al., 2007a,b; Rosenberger et al., 2017). Diluting the milk with water or slowly restricting the amount of milk can success- fully achieve gradual weaning; this will increase start- er intake and minimize the growth check at weaning (Khan et al., 2011b). Gradual weaning has been shown to minimize the effects of weaning distress (Weary et al., 2008).Growing Heifers Growing replacement heifers are normally fed a high- forage, moderate-energy diet formulated to meet their nutrient requirements and control ADG (National Re- search Council, 2001; DeVries, 2010). Heifers should not be limit fed. Some have argued that feeding growing heifers a nutrient-dense diet re- duces feeding time (Hoffman et al., 2007) and is an effective strategy to reduce feed costs, decrease fecal excretion, and increase feed efficiency (Lascano et al., 2009; Kitts et al., 2011). However, this feeding manage- ment regimen has also been linked to certain behavioral concerns; limit feeding reduces feeding and lying time and increases idle standing time (Hoffman et al., 2007; Greter et al., 2011; Kitts et al., 2011), both of which are known risk factors for lameness in older animals. Limit feeding also increases vocalization levels (Hoffman et al., 2007) and has been associated with increased levels of tongue rolling, head nodding, and bar biting (Redbo et al., 1996; Lindstr\u00f6m and Redbo, 2000). Oral stereo- typies associated with limit feeding may be a conse- quence of frustration or hunger due to a lack of satiety resulting from feed being available for a short duration and in a limited amount (Lindstr\u00f6m and Redbo, 2000). Oral stereotypies have been overwhelmingly associated with barren and poor environments that cause a myri- ad of welfare concerns (Mason and Latham, 2004). Lactating Dairy Cows Cows should not be emaciated (BCS 2; Edmonson et al., 1989). Body condition can be used as an outcome- based measure to evaluate the welfare implications of the nutrition program and should be evaluated on a regular basis. Except as necessary for a particular re- search or teaching protocol, dairy cattle should be fed diets formulated to meet their needs for maintenance, growth, production, and reproduction, see Chapter 2: Agricultural Animal Health Care. Beyond the guidelines provided in the NRC (2001), physically effective fiber, or the fiber that stimulates chewing, is required to maintain rumen function and health (Zebeli et al., 2012). In best practice, feed ingredients and finished feeds are whole- some, carefully mixed, and stored and delivered to cattle to minimize contamination or spoilage of feeds. To en- sure freshness, under best practice, feeds that are not consumed are removed daily from feeders and mangers, especially high-moisture feeds such as silage. HUSBANDRY Use of Outcome-Based Measures to Monitor Welfare Within the dairy industry, outcome-based measures are increasingly used to assess and monitor welfare. 100 CHAPTER 7: DAIRY CATTLE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020This approach is particularly valuable in sectors with diverse management and facilities that can achieve good animal care in several ways. Rather than provid- ing prescriptive instructions about how to house and manage animals, we can rely instead on how cattle respond to evaluate quality of care. Common animal- based measures include dairy cattle hygiene, locomo- tion, body condition, and injuries. Injuries include hair loss, swelling, and abrasions on the hocks, knees, and neck and broken tails. Less common in industry-wide on-farm assessments, but also valuable, are respiration rate and panting, both measures of heat load. Bedding type and stall configuration are known risk factors for hock and knee injuries, and neck injuries are associ- ated with feedbunk and neck rail design. Locomotion scores are often divided into moderate and severe lame- ness, and it is widely understood that both are painful (Whay et al., 1997). Body condition is often evaluated in terms of animals being too thin or too fat, as both ends of the extremes are associated with animal welfare concerns. Hygiene scoring systems vary but, in gen- eral, the goal is to identify dirty animals. There are 2 concerns here: wet or soiled bedding compromises com- fort, and udder cleanliness corresponds with measures of mammary health. Incorporating such measures into the day-to-day management of a dairy farm is increas- ingly common nationwide and provides valuable feed- back about the care provided. Restraint Cattle should not be restrained for more than 1 h at a time. Lying time is a critical component of a dairy cow's time budget, and management practices that cause lying deprivation are problematic. Periods of 2 or 4 h of lying deprivation were shown to cause detrimen- tal behavioral changes that were evident up to 72 h af- terward (Cooper et al., 2007). Similarly, behavioral in- dicators of restlessness increased during 4 h of restraint at the feed barrier, regardless of the floor type on which the cows were housed (rubber vs. concrete; Krebs et al., 2011). After 3 h of deprivation, cows prioritized lying over feeding (Metz, 1985). As little as 1 h of restraint was sufficient for cows to display increased behavioral indicators of restlessness, such as weight shifting and increased steps. Stanchions, head gates, and squeeze chutes can be utilized, but acclimation and positive re- inforcement by individuals trained in low-stress han- dling can minimize the need for additional restraint by halters, rope, and tail hold. In best practice, hobbles and casting ropes are used selectively and only when necessary for the health of the cow, not as a corrective device for problematic behaviors. Maternity Pen Management Movement of cows into the maternity pen is often based upon calving signs; cows are moved when calv-ing is imminent. However, the duration of labor can be affected depending on what stage of labor the cow is in when moved. For instance, Proudfoot et al. (2013) showed that cows moved during late stage 1 experi- enced a delay in the second stage of labor, which was likely driven by altered lying behavior. Delays at this stage may lead to an elevated risk for calving complica- tions. Estimates suggest that between 2 and 23% of dairy cows within a herd experience dystocia that requires farmer or veterinarian assistance (Mee, 2004, 2008). Dystocia is painful (Huxley and Whay, 2006) and as- sociated with reduced milk yield; it increases the risk of health disorders, reproductive complications for the cow (Oltenacu et al., 1988), and risk of death for the calf (Tenhagen et al., 2007). Management of the cow at calving time has been reviewed extensively by Mee (2004), who emphasized that the vast majority of multiparous cows calve suc- cessfully without intervention, whereas a greater pro- portion of primiparous cows may need assistance. If calving progress in stage 2 of labor appears interrupted, an examination informs the decision of whether or not assistance needs to be given, or whether veterinary in- volvement is needed. Sick Cows Sick cows should be monitored daily for changes in clinical signs and treatments administered according to predetermined protocols. Injections Dairy cattle are routinely administered medicines, vaccines, and anesthesia via injection. Despite evidence that injections are painful in humans (Gidudu et al., 2012), few studies have evaluated needle-related pain in other species. Ede et al. (2018) recently demonstrated that dairy calves find intramuscular injections in the rump aversive, but to date, no studies have evaluated methods to alleviate injection pain in cattle. However, it is recommended that the number of injections be minimized, while still maintaining animal health. This applies, for example, when considering injections given to synchronize estrous cycles or using exogenous bovine somatotropin. Hoof Care It is recommended that hoof trimming be practiced to a high standard. Each cow should be trimmed at around dry off and again 2-4 months after calving, and an effective footbath program implemented to control infectious hoof disease (Griffiths et al., 2018). Locomo- tion should be routinely scored in lactating and dry cows. Best practice suggests that severe lameness (al- most unable to bear weight on the affected limb) should 101 CHAPTER 7: DAIRY CATTLE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020be 1% and moderate lameness (asymmetric gait with noticeable weight transfer off the affected limb) should be 15% in lactating cows (Cook, 2018). Lameness is a significant animal welfare concern and affects the ability of the cow to eat, rest, reproduce, and remain in the herd. Prevention strategies are es- sential, especially considering that, globally, ~24% of cows are lame (reviewed by Cook, 2016). The etiopathogenesis of a variety of hoof lesions has been researched and reviewed extensively (e.g., Cook and Nordlund, 2009; Bicalho and Oikonomou, 2013), centering on genetic, nutritional, hormonal, mechani- cal, infectious, and environmental factors. Herd-level risk factors for lameness have been studied in a variety of production systems in recent years, and several con- sistent findings have emerged from these studies. Fac- tors that appear to be associated with lower lameness risk include less time standing on concrete (Bell et al., 2009); use of deep-bedded comfortable stalls designed to accommodate the size of the cow using them (Cook, 2003; Chapinal et al., 2013; Solano et al., 2015) (see Tables 7-1 and 7-2), with less restrictive neck rail loca- tions and absence of stall lunge obstructions (Chapinal et al., 2013; Westin et al., 2016); access to pasture or an outside exercise lot (Chapinal et al., 2013); use of non- slip, nontraumatic flooring scraped of manure when the cows are outside the pen (Barker et al., 2009); use of a divided feed barrier and wider feed alleys (Westin et al., 2016); prompt recognition and treatment of lame- ness (Barker et al., 2009); preventive hoof-trimming; and frequent footbathing (Griffiths et al., 2018). STANDARD AGRICUL TURAL PRACTICES Tail Docking Cattle must not be routinely tail docked. Tail dock- ing is the removal of the tail below the vulva by cut- ting with a hot iron or banding and removing necrotic tissue after 1 to 2 wk. It was initially performed to improve udder cleanliness and worker comfort. There is no scientific evidence that this practice improves ani- mal welfare; instead, it impairs the ability of the cow to deal with flies and may cause some pain (see review by Sutherland and Tucker, 2011). This practice should be used only to treat injury and is not standard practice. Removal of Extra Teats Some cattle are born with more than 4 teats, and the additional teats can interfere with the milking process later in life. Distress associated with extra teat removal has not been studied, and there is no information avail- able regarding pain associated with the process. Tissue damage associated with surgical procedures is thought to be minimized when procedures are done during the preweaning period with pain mitigation.Disbudding and Dehorning Pain relief, including a local nerve block, should be used for disbudding and dehorning. The horns of dairy cattle are typically removed if animals are not polled. The horn buds are thought to attach to the frontal bone of the skull at approximately 8 wk of age; there- fore, performing the procedure before this time point is recommended to minimize pain and damage. The 2 primary methods are cautery and caustic paste. For cautery, ample evidence indicates that both a local nerve block and administration of a nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug (NSAID) reduce the behavioral and physiological signs of pain (Stafford and Mellor, 2011). Use of paste to chemically destroy horn tissue is less common but is also painful (Stafford and Mellor, 2011), and a combination of a local nerve block and NSAID is effective in reducing the immediate pain associated with its application (Winder et al., 2017, 2018). Castration Pain relief, including a local nerve block, should be used for castration. Bull calves are typically castrated. Banding (restriction of blood flow to the testes) and sur- gical castration are the most common methods in the United States. However, castration by banding is known to cause lasting pain (Th\u00fcer et al., 2007; Marti et al., 2010; Becker et al., 2012), more so than surgical removal of the testicles. This pattern of chronic pain is apparent in older animals, but also those castrated with bands or rings at 5 to 7 d of age (up to at least 48 d afterward; Molony et al., 1995). Bands should not be used. In addi- tion to bands or rings causing pain over a longer period than other methods, this pain is not easily controlled by local anesthetic or NSAIDs. In contrast, both local an- esthesia and NSAIDs provide immediate benefit, when provided in combination, in young dairy calves that have been surgically castrated (Webster et al., 2013). Regard- less of method, it is advisable to administer tetanus an- titoxin at the time of castration. Branding Cattle should not be branded. Hot-iron and freeze branding are painful at the time of the procedure (e.g., Lay et al., 1992; Schwartzkopf-Genswein et al., 1998). Hot-iron brands remain more sensitive than unbranded tissue throughout the healing process (Tucker et al., 2014). Little is known about how to control either the immediate or long-term pain associated with this pro- cedure. Cow/Calf Separation Dairy calves are typically removed from the dam within hours of birth. The available evidence on distress 102 CHAPTER 7: DAIRY CATTLE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020associated with separation is limited to a few studies that have focused on the acute behavioral effects asso- ciated with separation; fewer vocalizations by the dam when separation takes place earlier compared with later (reviewed by Flower and Weary, 2003, Jensen, 2018; Meagher et al., 2019). There is little evidence that early separation provides any general benefit to the health of either cow or calf (see review by Beaver et al., 2019). Nose Rings Nose rings are used for the handling of show animals and bulls. Nose rings are also used to prevent cross sucking or milk \"stealing\" in dairy cows. These rings either penetrate the nasal septum or are tightened on either side of it. There is no evidence evaluating how these rings affect the animals, but it is assumed to be painful, and pain mitigation at insertion is recommend- ed if used to facilitate bull handling. It is recommended that alternative devices that do not penetrate the nasal septum are used to prevent milk stealing and for other reasons. Reproductive Management Approximately 90% of dairy cows on commercial dairy farms in the United States are bred by artificial insemination (AI) following a synchronization protocol, which was described in detail in a recent review (Colazo and Mapletoft, 2014; USDA, 2018), or when observed in estrus. Estrus detection is done either by direct ob- servation for associated behaviors or through the use of technologies designed for this purpose (Dolecheck et al., 2016). If using a synchronization protocol, the risks and challenges for the cows will be the same as outlined in the previous section on \"Injections.\" Cows find rectal and vaginal examination aversive (Kov\u00e1cs et al., 2014; Pilz et al., 2014). It is recommended that the number of repeated exams is minimized. The remaining 20% of dairy cows are naturally bred by a bull (see other sec- tions for requirements on the housing, husbandry, and management of bulls). Claw Amputation Claw amputation should not be done. Claw removal is used, in some cases, to treat severe hoof disorders. Rizk et al. (2012) found that intravenous regional anes- thesia alone or in combination with preoperative xyla- zine did not abolish the elevation in cortisol concentra- tions in dairy cows undergoing claw surgery, suggesting that pain persists, and Bicalho et al. (2006) found that cows undergoing claw amputation were much more likely to be culled and that they produced less milk than controls. Based on these findings, the practice of claw amputation to resolve lameness cannot be justified because it causes pain and does not benefit the animal.Electroejaculation Electroejaculation is used to collect semen from bulls for breeding soundness evaluation or AI. Electroejacu- lation is considered painful for the bull (Palmer, 2005) and results in significant increases in cortisol compared with nonelectrified controls (Whitlock et al., 2012). Compared with bulls electroejaculated without pain re- lief, caudal epidural anesthesia lowered the frequency of struggling, escape attempts, and vocalizations (Pa- gliosa et al., 2015). It also tended to reduce cortisol levels (Falk et al., 2001) and heart rate (Mosure et al., 1998). There are potentially less painful alternatives (e.g., transrectal massage, artificial vagina). However, transrectal massage increased progesterone in bulls (Falk et al., 2001) and cardiac responses during rectal palpation in cows (Kov\u00e1cs et al., 2014), leaving use of an artificial vagina as a less painful alternative that is recommended. ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT Refer to Chapter 4: Environmental Enrichment for information on enrichment of dairy cattle environments. HANDLING AND TRANSPORT Handling Cattle should not be handled roughly. Electric prods should not be used, except under certain very specific conditions (outlined in Chapter 5: Animal Handling and Transport. Cattle recognize individual people and become frightened of those who handle them aggres- sively (Rushen et al., 1999). Shouting, hitting, and us- ing cattle prods are frightening when used aggressively or inappropriately (Pajor et al., 2000, 2003). Cattle will show more vigilance behavior when exposed to a hu- man who has handled them roughly than when exposed to a gentle or unfamiliar handler (Welp et al., 2004). This research also indicates that humans may serve as a substitute for conspecific contact, if social contact is not possible. There are benefits associated with gentle and confident handlers, including improved milk pro- duction. For example, when humans stroke body parts commonly groomed by other cattle, such as the neck, cattle are more likely to approach humans, indicating that appropriate and gentle contact with humans can improve human-animal interactions (Schmied et al., 2008). Low-stress handling of dairy cattle has received relatively little attention from the scientific community, but appropriate movement of people, well-designed fa- cilities, optimal lighting, nonslip flooring, and smooth, quiet restraint are all thought to be beneficial (see review by Kammel et al., 2019). Further information about best practice is covered in Chapter 5: Animal Handling and Transport.103 CHAPTER 7: DAIRY CATTLE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020Transport of the Milk-Fed Calf from the Farm Neonatal dairy calves should be supported by the body in both arms or placed in a wheelbarrow or special cart when being moved. They must never be dragged by the legs, head, tail, or other body part nor thrown. Departure from the farm at a young age can be prob- lematic for dairy calves. Calves, 5 to 9 d of age, trans- ported between 6 and 12 h in conjunction with a 30-h feed withdrawal, had reduced concentrations of glucose (Fisher et al., 2014). These calves spent approximately 20 to 30% of their transport time lying, which indicates that feed withdrawal might be the more negative aspect of departure from the farm. These results were incon- sistent with responses of 5- to 10-d-old calves exposed to a 12-h transport combined with a 30-h feed with- drawal (Todd et al., 2000). Within that study, calves transported at a low stocking density were able to rest during transport, which resulted in them being meta- bolically indistinguishable from untransported calves. Careful planning of feed management and duration of transport can be used to mitigate this effect. Use of umbilical cord dryness to establish a suitable age to transport calves off the farm is problematic. Umbilical cords were determined to be dry between 1 and 8 d of age (Hides and Hannah, 2005). Although empirical evidence is lacking to support the establishment of the appropriate age for the transportation of calves from the facility, calves were easier to manage at 9 to 11 d of age than at 5 or 7 d of age (Jongman and Butler, 2013). Older calves required less time and fewer interventions to complete a walking course (Jongman and Butler, 2013). Although this does not establish the effect of age on a calf's ability to cope with transport stress, it does indicate that they will be easier to handle if moved when they are older. Transport of All Other Age Classes Refer to Chapter 5: Animal Handling and Transport for information on handling and transport of dairy cat- tle. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS Milking Machine Maintenance and Udder Sanitation Proper husbandry of lactating dairy cows requires correctly functioning milking machines and routines. Facilities should be designed and operated to standards meeting or exceeding those of Grade A dairies, as de- fined in the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance (FDA, 2017). This can be accomplished by regular maintenance and following the recommended mastitis control program of the National Mastitis Council (https://www.nmcon- line.org/) and evaluated by looking at both somatic cell counts and rates of clinical mastitis. Personnel respon- sible for milking should receive ongoing training about proper milking procedures as the frequency of training has been associated with adequacy of milking perfor- mance (Rodrigues and Ruegg, 2005). Stray Voltage The scientific evidence strongly suggests there is no relationship between behavioral responses to stray volt- age and physiological or hormonal responses. There is no apparent relationship among behavioral modifica- tions, milk production, and animal health (reviewed in Reinemann, 2012). The only way to determine whether stray voltage is a potential cause of abnormal behav- iors or poor performance is by performing a thorough investigation of the facility to determine the presence of stray voltage and rule out other explanations for issues. For confirmation of stray voltage, a potential of 2 to 4 V (60 Hz, rms) is to be measured between 2 points that an animal might contact (or animal contact measure- ment), and some animals should exhibit signs of avoid- ance behavior. The animal contact voltage measure- ment with an appropriate shunt resistor value provides the only reliable indication of exposure levels. Voltage readings at cow contact points are to be made with a 500- or 1000- resistor across the 2 measuring leads to the cow contact points in addition to open circuit measurements (Lefcourt, 1991; Reinemann, 2012). If suspected, it is advisable to have a qualified electrician or the local power supplier evaluate the situation. Automated Milking Systems The use of AMS to milk cows is becoming increas- ingly common in North America. Although the technol- ogy successfully harvests milk from the individual cow, AMS present some management and design challenges to optimize health and production. Management deci- sions within this system include allowing cows to freely visit the robot or to be forced to visit by using access to resources and stocking density/unit and within the pen. Recent studies suggest that increased milk per cow is associated with free rather than forced traffic (Tremblay et al., 2016) and with increased bunk space per cow (Deming et al., 2013), whereas higher milk per AMS unit may be achieved in pens with 2 units rather than 1 unit (Tremblay et al., 2016). Management incor- porates a check for cows with abnormally long milking intervals so that they can be fetched and allowed access to the unit via a fetch pen, while avoiding overly pro- longed stays in the pen.104 CHAPTER 7: DAIRY CATTLE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020Dry Cows Common industry practice today is that milking typically ends approximately 40 to 60 d before calving. With the introduction of blanket dry-cow antibiotic therapies, abrupt cessation of milking is now thought to be the most common method of achieving dry-off. How- ever, improved genetics and management have resulted in many cows still producing 25 to 30 kg/d of milk at the time of dry-off, which may pose risks for udder health (e.g., increased intramammary infections due to delayed teat-canal plug formation and milk leakage; Schukken et al., 1993; Dingwell et al., 2004) and pain (O'Driscoll et al., 2011). Zobel et al. (2013) showed that abruptly dried off cows had increased amounts and du- ration of milk leakage, especially when milk production was high at dry-off compared with gradual dry-off or gradual cessation achieved through intermittent milk- ing over a period of days. Some studies have raised con- cerns regarding some of the procedures used to achieve cessation of milk production (reviewed by Zobel et al., 2015). Others have shown that abrupt cessation of milking may also induce hunger due to the need to re- duce milk production through limit feeding; this causes distress (e.g., increased vocalizations) compared with gradual cessation of milking (Valizaheh et al., 2008; Tucker et al., 2009). Gradual reduction in milking fre- quency at dry-off resulted in fewer new intramammary infections at calving (Natzke et al., 1975). Best practice is to perform gradual dry off. Cows should be dried off before being culled from the farm (Stojkov et al., 2020). Nonambulatory Animals (Downer Cows) The care of nonambulatory cows is one of the great- est animal welfare challenges facing the dairy industry. Cows that are unable or unwilling to stand and remain recumbent for more than 12 h are typically defined as nonambulatory or \"downer\" cows (Stojkov et al., 2016). The condition typically begins with a primary cause such as hypocalcemia (milk fever), injury, or trauma during parturition. Lack of movement in the hours that follow can then cause additional problems, including ischemic damage to the pelvic muscles and nerves that make it impossible for the cow to rise. This secondary damage can be fatal, and producers rightly recognize that helping the cow stand can prevent this damage and assist recovery. If the animal needs be moved to a safe area, this should be done as soon as possible by properly trained employees in a manner that minimizes stress and trau- ma while providing assisted support for the weight of the animal (e.g., bucket, sled, or sling) over the shortest distance possible. It must never involve dragging by the head, leg, or tail. Recent evidence shows that nonambulatory cows benefit from high levels of care while recumbent when this care is administered within 24 h; recovery is un- likely after 48 h (Stojkov et al., 2016). Moreover, these authors showed that cows that were recumbent for just 12 h before flotation treatment, where cows are placed in a float tank filled with water to allow them to be upright, while limiting weight bearing, were 4.37 times more likely to recover. Cows that had been recumbent for 48 h or more had low odds for recovery. The same study reported that nonambulatory animals should be provided a clean pen with shade and shelter from poor weather with continual access to fresh feed and wa- ter throughout the day; such animals were significantly more likely to recover than cows provided poor care. Bulls The safety of humans and animals is the chief con- cern underlying bull management practices. Breeding dairy bulls are known to be aggressive towards humans. As a best practice, staff are trained in safety issues for this class of animal. In consultation with the veterinar- ian, bulls are managed in such a way that they have appropriate rest and that their health issues, such as lameness, body condition and infectious disease, are given appropriate attention. Cloning, Editing and Transgenics Refer to Chapter 1: Institutional Policies for informa- tion on cloning, editing, and transgenesis as they relate to the care and use of dairy cattle. EUTHANASIA AND SLAUGHTER Acceptable methods for euthanasia are outlined in the AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia (AVMA, 2020) and must be used. Approved methods for cattle are further discussed in Chapter 2: Agricultural Animal Health Care. Disposal involves a commercial render- ing service or other means (e.g., burial, composting, or incineration) according to applicable ordinances and regulations. In the United States, all procedures used to slaugh- ter research and teaching animals that will enter the food chain must comply with US Code of Federal Reg- ulations, Title 7, Chapter 48, Humane Slaughter of Livestock (https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/US- CODE-2011-title7/pdf/USCODE-2011-title7-chap48. pdf). The North American Meat Institute (NAMI) has embraced guidelines (https://animalhandling.org/pro- ducers/guidelines_audits) that exceed the regulatory requirements (Grandin, 2017), and the NAMI guide- lines (NAMI, 2019) are incorporated here by reference.

Equine animals (horses, ponies, donkeys, and mules) are still commonly used as draft animals for plowing and trans- portation worldwide, especially by local communities (e.g., Amish) in the United States and among small- scale farmers in developing countries. Ranch horses are commonly used on cattle ranches and feedlots. Donkeys may be used to protect sheep and goats from preda- tors while on pasture, and the biomedical industry uses equine animals, usually horses, to produce antivenom serum, antibodies, and pharmaceutical products. For example, estrogens are extracted from pregnant mares' urine and used in the production of hormone replace- ment therapy for menopausal women. Horses are commonly used in therapeutic riding pro- grams for physically and mentally challenged people (Kaiser et al., 2006). In addition to research studies us- ing equine animals to investigate questions pertaining specifically to this species, horses are used as models for human exercise physiology, arthritis, and human respi- ratory diseases such as asthma (Malinowski et al., 2006; Gordon et al., 2007; Kirschvink and Reinhold, 2008). The natural occurrence of metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance in horses mimic similar disorders in humans such that horses are used for research on the mechanisms and treatments of these disorders with human applications in mind (Hodavance et al., 2007). Whether horses are used for pleasure, work, teaching, research, or biomedical purposes, an appropriate and comprehensive level of animal care should be provided and implemented with all protocols. FACILITIES AND ENVIRONMENT Indoor Environment Dimensions of indoor occupancy should be sufficient for horses to make normal postural adjustments at will, unless the approved protocol requires otherwise. A rea- sonable area allowance for a single horse is 2 to 2.5 times the height of the horse (at the withers) squared (Zeeb, 1981; Raabymagle and Ladewig, 2006), which permits essential movements, including lying down in sternal or lateral recumbency. Although horses can en- gage in slow-wave sleep while standing, rapid eye move- ment (REM) sleep occurs only when the horse is re- cumbent (Dallaire and Ruckebusch, 1974; Ruckebusch, 1975). Although the exact function and requirement needs of REM sleep may be unclear, the opportunity and space to experience REM sleep while in a recum- bent position may be a consideration for suitable hous- ing of horses. Larger indoor areas allow for longer peri- ods of recumbency in stalled horses (Raabymagle and Ladewig, 2006). Box stalls should be large enough to permit the horse to lie down, stand up, turn around, and roll (Chung et al., 2018). Table 8-1 provides suggested dimensions for housing of equids used in research and teaching. A 3.7- \u00d7 3.7-m (12- \u00d7 12-ft) box stall should accommodate most light horse breeds. Tie-stalls are recommended for limited daily use, because they do not allow for the horse to move freely. Horses housed in tie-stalls should have access to free or forced exercise daily.

Stall doors should be wide enough to permit the horse to safely enter and leave its stall comfortably and to facilitate visual and auditory contact with conspecif- ics. Stall doors should be either solid or made of mate- rial that cannot injure or entangle the horse. Stall doors may be sliding, hinged, or divided (Dutch). Divided doors allow the horse to have, in effect, a larger stall when it extends its head out, whereas closing the top door will limit the visual field of the horse. Care must be taken when Dutch doors or stall guards are used so that the horse cannot reach light switches, electrical cords, or electrical outlets. Hinged or divided doors can be secured when open to prevent injuries or the block- ing of adjacent alleys. Suitable flooring materials for indoor stalls include rubber mats, artificial turf, packed clay, gravel, stone dust, asphalt, concrete, sand, and wood. Floor material should be selected for ease of cleaning and for sanita- tion, comfort, and safety of the horse. Slippery floors can lead to injuries, and hard surfaces can cause lame- ness. Harder floorings require deeper bedding, especial- ly for larger horses; the installation of rubber mats over the surface may be the best option. Concrete floors with a rough broom float surface that slope to a floor drain or exterior door are suggested for wash areas, al- leys, and feed and equipment storage areas. Pervious concrete is an acceptable floor surface for wash areas because it will allow water to drain through the con- crete and does not require an exposed drain. Pervious concrete does require specialized installation. Stall design should allow for proper ventilation, which may assist in decreasing moisture or humidity levels and odors in the stall. An opening above the floor in walls and partitions sufficient in size to allow air move- ment will aid stall ventilation and can be closed with a removable filler strip, if needed. A variety of materials can be used between stalls to aid in ventilation, such as steel rods, pipe, welded steel fencing, chain-linked fenc- ing, hardwood slats, or comparable materials. Solid in- terior stall walls are suggested for housing stallions and for the walls of foaling stalls to prevent aggression by the postpartum mare toward horses in adjacent stalls (aggression that may be redirected toward her foal). Ceilings, when present, should be made of a mois- ture-proof material, preferably one that is smooth with minimal exposed pipes and fixtures. Commonly, ceiling heights for stalls are 2.4 to 3.1 m (8 to 10 ft) to allow for adequate ventilation and safe confinement for the variety of different-sized horses. However, the minimum ceiling height should be at least 0.3 m (1 ft) higher than the horse's ears when the head is held at its highest level. Windows or openings are recommended but not es- sential if adequate lighting and ventilation are supplied by other means. However, windows may also provide visual contact between horses and may reduce some stereotypic behaviors associated with frustration of iso-lated horses such as weaving and head nodding (Cooper et al., 2000). Windows also allow the caretaker to see the horse from outside the stall. A tip-out or remov- able window in each box stall aids lighting and natu- ral (i.e., nonmechanical) ventilation in warm weather. The bottom of breakable stable windows should be at a height that is not vulnerable to kicking, and windows should be protected with metal bars or mesh to prevent breakage. Skylights or translucent panels in the roof are useful for allowing additional light into the barn area. Dutch doors in stalls may be used for windows and ventilation on exterior walls. An alley should be provided between rows of stalls that face each other that allows room for horses to pass, to handle feed and bedding, and to manage manure; an alley located behind a single row of stalls or in front of a row of stalls allows for feeding horses and for people to pass safely. Alleys in horse barns should be wide enough for the horse to turn around, and if narrower, should have exits to larger areas at both ends. Alley doors to the outside may be overhead, swinging, or slid- ing and should be sized appropriately to the alleyway. A wider alley is suggested where Dutch doors permit horses to extend their heads into the alley to avoid un- necessary contact with passing horses or people. Horse facilities in tropical and subtropical climates may have stall arrangements that are very open to the outside. Commonly used are shed row barns in which the stalls open to the outside under an overhanging roof. Added ventilation is encouraged by stall doors with openings to the floor and slatted or nonsolid stall walls. If barns without these features are used in these environments, these should be constructed to provide proper ventilation. Barns in tropical regions may have large stalls constructed with thick concrete block or well-insulated walls, very high ceilings, and extensive roof venting, unless complete climate control (air-con- ditioning) is planned. Bedding. The type of bedding should be consistent with the comfort of the horse and proper sanitation. Acceptable bedding is any material that provides ab- sorption and sound footing, including wheat, oat, or rye straw, grass hay, wood shavings or pellets, peat moss, sawdust, paper, shredded cardboard, and sand. Horses fed on the floor of the stall rather than from a feeder should not have sand bedding because they tend to in- gest the sand and may suffer from intestinal impaction as a result. Bedding should be free of toxic chemicals or other substances that would injure horses or people. Black walnut shavings (Ralston and Rich, 1983), fresh cedar shavings, cocoa husks, and woods that have been pressure-treated have caused illness; thus, it is recom- mended that these beddings not be used. Cocoa and cedar can also result in abnormal blood and urine pro- files. Rubber mats alone may be used when the fa- cility design or experimental or instructional protocol does not permit traditional bedding or for horses that are hyperallergic or suffering from respiratory diseases. Otherwise, absorbent bedding should be used over rub-114 CHAPTER 8: HORSES Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020ber mats. Regular cleaning and replacement of bedding materials will minimize the presence of ammonia and provide the horse with a clean, dry place for rest. Temperature and Ventilation. Horses can acclimate to subzero air temperatures (to approximately 0\u00b0F with- out a windbreak or shelter) but will benefit from the availability of simple structures such as a windbreak or a run-in stall to protect them from wind and pre- cipitation during winter months and from the sun dur- ing hot summer months. Newborn foals require more protection because of their relatively high lower criti- cal temperature and their reduced ability to regulate body temperature. Any building enclosed on all sides that houses horses should have a properly designed and maintained ventilation system (Webster et al., 1987). The purpose of ventilation during hot summer months is to aid in dissipating heat. Increasing the ventilation capacity during hot weather may be achieved by in- creasing the air velocity directly across the horse, usu- ally by utilizing circulating fans and opening windows and doors. During winter months, proper ventilation helps with the control of moisture or condensation in enclosed buildings as well as decreasing the level of air contaminants such as dust, mold, pathogens, or gas- es (especially ammonia) that accumulate in enclosed buildings housing horses. Poor air quality inside stables may compromise the respiratory health of the horse, es- pecially in the winter months. Supplemental heat may be considered with cold weather ventilation to improve the comfort of horses and handlers, and insulation is recommended to prevent heat loss. Proper ventilation or the number of air changes per unit of time should be related to environmental temperature, humidity, atmo- spheric vapor pressure, total weight or stocking density of horses, and heat and water vapor production (from animals, equipment, and bedding) in the building. Lighting. Lighting should permit adequate inspec- tion of horses and be available during handling, feed- ing, or other activities involving horses. Some evidence indicates that total darkness in a horse barn should be avoided (Houpt and Houpt, 1988); it is recommend- ed that windows or another light source be present at night to avoid injury. If accessible by the horse, all lighting fixtures, electrical wiring, and switches should be recessed or otherwise protected against damage by or to the horses. Noise. Horses are sometimes disturbed by sudden noises, and background white noise or music is often used to mask or habituate horses to unexpected sounds that might otherwise startle them. Sanitation and Waste Disposal. Stalls should be cleaned as needed, usually daily, to minimize pests, keep horses clean and dry, and maintain the air suitably free of dust and odors, especially ammonia. Sloping floors in stalls and alleys are useful for drainage of urine and wa- ter. Gases may be emitted during storage and handling of manure and should be considered for human safety. A 450-kg (1,000-lb) horse produces about 24.5 kg (54 lb) of manure daily, plus spilled water, soiled bedding, and other waste. Although horse manure as deposited is composed of about 75 to 85% water, it is relatively dry to handle (MWPS, 2005). Horses should not have access to manure waste storage areas. Outdoor Environment Pastures, Paddocks, and Corrals. Horses evolved to exist on rangeland, where shelter, water, and food can be sparse. Horse pastures, paddocks, and corrals used to house domesticated horses should provide a reason- ably comfortable environment, including sunshade, windbreak, a firm surface upon which to rest, sufficient area for normal postural adjustments, and an enclo- sure that confines the horses safely and is free of trash, holes, and other dangerous objects but avoids unneces- sary physical restraint. These outdoor accommodations must provide for the biological needs of the animal (e.g., feed and water, exercise, reproduction if appro- priate, and freedom to avoid contact with excreta). An exception to the provision of sunshade and windbreak is those animals on extensive rangeland where shelter is absent or sparse, and water and forage can be long distances away. Horses are known to thrive in these environments; however, domesticated horses should be monitored to ensure they are not suffering from hyper- or hypothermia or dehydration. The requirement of the horse for space in paddock and corral areas may vary considerably depending on environmental situations (e.g., soil type, climate, for- age availability, and drainage), size and type of animals (ponies, light horses, or draft horses), and, in certain cases, temperament of the individuals in a group. The minimum area per horse in an outdoor pen should be suitable for normal postural changes, but a larger area per horse is suggested, especially for groups of horses. Continuous long-term maintenance of horses in the minimal area should be discouraged because it does not allow for sufficient exercise, especially for young horses. In wet or muddy conditions, dry areas should be available to allow horses an option to lie on dry ground. Providing an opportunity to forage decreases antago- nistic behavior between horses that are housed on dry lots (Benhajali et al., 2009). Tight spaces and sharp corners or projections should be avoided in pens to re- duce injury and the chance of dominant animals trap- ping subordinates. Pens should be cleaned as needed to ensure proper sanitation and pest control. In temperate climates, horses may often be confined to paddocks or pastures without shelter other than that provided by terrain, trees, wind fences, or sunshades. However, shelters should be provided in very hot, very cold, or wet environments when possible, as provision may not be feasible for horses on rangeland. Shelter providing shade can mitigate some of the effects of heat and insect-avoidance behaviors (Holcomb et al., 2014; Hartmann et al., 2015; Holcomb and Stull, 2016). The determination of whether horses have adequate shelter 115 CHAPTER 8: HORSES Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020should be based on the absence of hypo- and hyperther- mia. If the horse is experiencing these conditions, mea- sures must be taken to alleviate them. The thermoneu- tral zone of horses has been estimated to have a lower critical temperature at 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F) and an upper critical temperature between 20 and 30\u00b0C (68 to 86\u00b0F; Morgan, 1998). Depending on age, weight, feeding level, accli- matization status, and husbandry system, no additional shelter may be necessary. Still, in certain cases, bedding may be required to enable the horse to keep warm and dry. Sunshades or access to a ventilated stable should be provided in areas where summer temperatures reach 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F) or higher if adequate natural shade is not available (Morgan, 1998). In high traffic areas, there is a tendency for the for- mation of mud during wet seasons of the year. These areas can include gates, areas around waterers or feed- ers, and entrances to run-in sheds. To reduce the prob- lems associated with mud, high-traffic pads or alterna- tives are recommended. Run-In Shed. The minimum size of shelter per horse is approximately the area of a box stall. As a general rule for the size of a run-in shed housing more than one horse, allow for 11.1 m2 (120 ft2) each for the first 2 average-sized horses and then 5.6 m2 (60 ft2) for each additional horse kept in the pasture or paddock. The size, design, and number of shelters should allow all ani- mals in the paddock to share the shelter(s) at any given time. Eaves located on the back wall of the shed may be opened to allow for additional ventilation. Drainage systems should direct water away from areas of heavy use (e.g., near feeders, watering troughs, run-in sheds, and shades). Fencing and Gates. Guides to fencing dimensions and materials are available from the MWPS (2005) and other sources. Fencing may be made of various mate- rials, including wooden posts and rails, solid boards, wire (including high tensile wire), metal pipe, plastic, rubber, and V-mesh or chain-link fencing. It is not nec- essary to paint or seal fences, except when the proto- col requires it. Barbed wire fencing should be avoided when horses are housed in close confinement. Fences should be constructed to avoid features injurious to horses such as sharp, protruding objects (e.g., nails, wires, bolts, and latches), and, if possible, narrow tight corners in which a horse can be trapped by a herd-mate and possibly injured. Fence heights for horses are given in Table 8-1. The bottoms of fences and gates should be high enough above the ground or extend to the ground to prevent the horse from catching a leg or hoof under the fence or gate, especially when rolling. Electric fencing may be used for horses under certain conditions such as pasture rotation. Electric fences may not be adequate under some environmental conditions such as areas with heavy snow accumulation. Electric fence controllers should have been approved by Under- writers Laboratories (https://ul.org/) or other accepted testing organization. Highly visible, conductive plastic tape 0.75 to 1.25 in wide is an effective fence material to cross fence pastures or paddocks. Other electric fence materials can be used, but they need to be highly vis- ible in nature. Gates may be constructed of several different materi- als, including wooden boards, pipe, sheet metal, and wire. The height of a gate should be similar to that of the adjoining fence to discourage animals from at- tempting to jump over at the lower point. The width of a gate should span the opening completely and not leave a space where an animal may be caught between the fence and gate. The bottom of a gate, like the bot- tom of fences, should either extend to the ground or be high enough above the ground to prevent injuries. FEED AND WATER Horses have evolved over millions of years as grazing animals, spending their days traveling long distances in search of water and feed, primarily highly fibrous forag- es of widely varying types. The horse's digestive tract is well adapted to this lifestyle, with a stomach and small intestine capable of efficient enzymatic breakdown and absorption of the digestible components of feeds. The large intestine, composed of the cecum and large co- lon, functions as a fermentation chamber in which mi- crobes reside. These microbes receive their nutrition from the less digestible components of the digesta and anaerobically produce end products that are beneficial to the horse. Research into the motivation of horses show that they have a strong motivation to work for hay (high-fiber diet) when fed a low-fiber diet (Elia et al., 2010), will work for the opportunity to exercise, and even more if placed with conspecifics (Lee et al., 2011) while avoiding exercise on a treadmill, and that horses have a high motivation for physical contact, even if it is just muzzle to muzzle (S\u00f8ndergaard et al., 2011). Nu- tritional and management practices that allow horses to eat throughout the day, have freedom of movement, and allow socialization with other horses will enhance the horse's well-being (Clarke et al., 1990; Davidson and Harris, 2007). Horses kept on farms in pasture settings, surrounded by their herd-mates, generally thrive in an environment not much different from their evolutionary environ- ment. Provided that feed, water, and shelter are avail- able, horses do an excellent job of utilizing accessible feeds in a natural environment to meet not only their nutritional needs, but also their exercise and social re- quirements. Research and teaching facilities as well as modern, urban society usually do not keep horses in natural pas- toral settings, but instead frequently keep horses in- doors in individual stalls or small outdoor paddocks. These horses have little opportunity to exercise freely and are often fed a diet that is nutrient-dense, requir- ing dietary limitation in feed intake. To help mitigate 116 CHAPTER 8: HORSES Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020this situation, it is recommended to supplement with concentrates only when the available forage does not provide sufficient nutrients to maintain an appropriate body condition for the horse. Equine obesity, laminitis, colic, and associated maladies may result from inappro- priate nutritional programs and management practices utilized in the care of horses. Digestive Physiology The digestive tract of the horse classifies the horse as a nonruminant herbivore. The horse commonly eats plant materials but does not possess a rumen, one of the distinguishing features of ruminants such as cattle, sheep, and goats. However, the horse's large intestine (cecum and colon) has a rumen-like function, because it hosts a large community of microbes (primarily bac- teria) that can anaerobically digest the components of the horse's diet that are not previously digested by en- zymes in the stomach or small intestine. Breakdown of indigestible carbohydrates and other substrates not absorbed in the small intestine provides nutrition to the microbes, resulting in end products called volatile fatty acids, which are absorbed into the circulatory system and utilized by the tissues of the body. In horses main- tained on all-forage diets, volatile fatty acids derived from microbial fermentation can provide the majority of the horse's total energy maintenance requirement. The microbes of the large intestine perform optimal- ly in a consistent internal environment. Intermittent meals or bolus feeding, when improperly managed, can disrupt the microbial population in the hindgut of the horse. This may result in large fluctuations in nutrients and by-products in the circulation to the tissues, set- ting up potentially detrimental physiological conditions such as laminitis or colic. Thus, the daily management of nutritional programs for confined horses is important to their health and welfare. Horses housed inside or where they cannot graze should be fed and watered at least twice a day. More frequent feeding or ad libitum access to hay and water is preferred. For horses confined in areas where they cannot graze, roughage in the form of hay or other fi- brous feedstuffs should be the main component of the diet as a dietary source of nutrients and bulk in the diet. Specifically, the absolute minimum recommenda- tion for fiber is 12.5 g (0.44 oz) of dry matter per kg (2.2 lb) of body weight (12.5 lb of dry matter for a 1,000-lb horse). In addition, the amount offered that provides species-specific feed intake behavior of a mini- mum of 8 h is recommended (Harris et al., 2017). Al- though a fiber requirement for the horse has not been determined by the National Research Council, diets must provide adequate bulk for several reasons: (1) to maintain a more or less \"full\" digestive tract; (2) as a reservoir of water and to help buffer the chyme; (3) to maintain a constant environment for microbes of the large intestine; (4) to reduce boredom in the stabled horse, lessening the incidence of stable vices such as cribbing, wood chewing, tail chewing, or ingestion of bedding; and (5) to approximate a more natural diet. Feeding Recommendations Horses should be fed so that they are neither obese nor too lean (Henneke et al., 1983). Body condition scores of 4 to 6 on a 9-point scale are considered aver- age, although many horses exceed this and are still con- sidered to be in good health. Horses that are not in ap- propriate body condition should be managed to allow body weight (BW) changes to occur slowly. To increase BW, forage quantity and quality should be increased first before concentrates are added. To decrease BW, concentrate intake should be decreased before forage intake is reduced. A reduction in energy intake of the ration should be accomplished without decreasing total daily dry feed intake below 1.5% of BW. To maintain normal body condition and health, hors- es should be fed to meet current nutrient requirements (NRC, 2007) for their class using feeds that are high quality, palatable, and consistently available. Although nutrient requirements of individual horses may diverge from National Research Council recommendations, the requirements are an excellent starting place for meet- ing the nutrient needs of horses in different life stages. Horses in different life stages and exercise regimens have different nutrient requirements. Total daily dry feed (hay and concentrate) consumption usually falls within a range of 1.5 to 3% of BW. The common types of hay for horses are legumes, grasses, cereal grains, or mixtures thereof. Hay is usually fed at a rate of 1% or more of BW for mature horses. Although no minimum amount of forage intake has been set for horses under various conditions with existing data (NRC, 2007), low- roughage diets are associated with increased incidence of gastric ulcers, and stereotypical behaviors such as wood chewing, cribbing, and weaving (Willard et al., 1977; McGreevy et al., 1995; Andrews and Nadeau, 1999; Parker et al., 2008). Legume hays, usually alfalfa or clover, are generally higher in protein, energy, and calcium than grass hay. Horses can easily gain weight on free-choice quantities of legume hay, whereas grass hay or cereal grain hay (i.e., oat hay) can sometimes be fed ad libitum because of their lower nutrient content while adding fiber or bulk to the ration. However, hors- es can gain too much weight on any type of forage,and attention to body condition is important. When no pas- ture is available, providing foraging opportunities via hay consumption may satisfy the strong motivation of horses to participate in feed intake behavior (i.e., graz- ing; Ellis, 2010). Concentrates are used to supply energy, protein, vi- tamins, and minerals to the ration and are typically characterized as high-energy, high-protein diets meant to supplement forage diets. Concentrates can be fed at different rates, depending on the nutritional need, but 117 CHAPTER 8: HORSES Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020care should be taken when total concentrate exceeds 1% of BW. Cereal grains such as oats, corn, barley, wheat, or milo are often supplemented as a source of calories in the diet and tend to be high in starch con- tent. Elevated levels of starch in diets have been im- plicated as causative for laminitis and other metabolic disorders in horses (Kronfeld et al., 2004). Overweight horses or those prone to metabolic diseases may ben- efit from a low-starch diet. Supplemental fat, usually in the form of vegetable oil, is sometimes used instead of or with cereal grains to increase the caloric density of the diet. Generally, it is recommended that the oil content not exceed 10 to 15% of the total ration. Sup- plemental protein is often required for growing horses fed grass hay-based rations, and soybean meal is com- monly added because of its palatability and high level of digestible protein. Vitamin and mineral supplements are frequently added to concentrate mixes to fortify the nutrient content of concentrates or the entire ration. Most natural forages and cereal grains are deficient in salt. Because horses can lose considerable amounts of salt through sweat, sodium chloride (NaCl, common salt) is often added to concentrates at rates of 0.5 to 1.0% or offered as a salt block or free choice as plain, iodized, cobalt-iodized, or trace-mineralized salt. Young horses, late-pregnant mares, lactating mares, and hard-working horses have the highest nutrient re- quirements. Growing horses and late-pregnant and lac- tating mares have greater energy, protein, vitamin, and mineral requirements than adult horses in maintenance condition. The primary requirement of performance or athletic horses above maintenance is for increased en- ergy. Often, somewhat higher needs for other nutrients are satisfied when the energy requirement is met, al- though in some cases, supplementation of additional minerals and vitamins may be appropriate. Geriatric horses may do better on rations with higher nutrient levels, similar to those for growing horses, perhaps be- cause of diminished metabolic efficiencies or confound- ing conditions. Details of nutrient requirements are presented in NRC (2007). Feed analysis of concentrates and forage materials can be used to ensure that the diet meets the nutrient requirements of the horse. In all cases, rations should be formulated with good-quality feeds free of contaminants, molds, and toxic weeds. Rations should be of appropriate physical form. Hay should be free of dust, mold, and foreign material. Con- centrates should be dust free and not too finely ground. Complete pelleted diets are sometimes fed to horses, but at least some long-stem hay or pasture is recommended to increase bulk in the ration and appease the desire to chew. Hard, crunchy pellets are consumed more slowly than soft, crumbly pellets (Freeman et al., 1990). How- ever, horses with poor quality teeth and geriatric horses may benefit from softer pellets or the addition of water to pellets to form a mash consistency. Care should be taken to ensure that horses are not accidentally given feed formulated for cattle that is supplemented with ionophores; horses are highly susceptible to illness or death when fed ionophores (NRC, 2007). Pastures and Rangelands for Horses Nutrient needs of horses on pasture or rangeland may be provided from available forages or by a combina- tion of forage plus supplemental feeding of roughage or concentrates. During certain periods of the year, growth of forages may be greatly reduced or the forage may become less palatable and digestible, necessitating supplemental feeding. Also, it is important to consider the effect of the environment on energy requirements, which increase significantly during periods of cold, wet weather (NRC, 2007). At other times, depending on stocking rate, little if any supplemental feeding may be required. If supplemental feeding is required in pasture situations, fenceline mangers, buckets, or boxes may be used to allow feeding from the fenceline. Multiple sites (buckets or boxes) are preferable to a single site to de- crease the risk of injury during aggressive competition for feed. Salt should be available to horses on pasture if the sodium content in the grasses and legumes of the pasture is insufficient to meet the horse's requirement. When horses are feeding only on pasture, the trace minerals known to be deficient locally may be added to the salt source or fed as palatable supplements. If horses are expected to meet their nutrient needs solely from pasture or rangeland, care must be taken to ensure that the resource can indeed support their requirements. Pasture stocking density varies from 0.4 to 4 ha (1 to 10 acres) or more per horse, depending on the type, concentration, and growth stage of the for- age and the season (Hintz, 1983). For smaller pastures, good management is required to optimize utilization of the limited space. Care may include regular fertilization and clipping (mowing) of excess growth to increase the nutrient value and palatability, the control of parasites through manure removal or pasture dragging to break up the manure piles, and the use of a rotational grazing system. Horses housed on rangeland should be moved to fresh range when available forage becomes limited. Pastures should be inspected routinely for growth of unusual or poisonous plants (Kingsbury, 1964; Oehme, 1986), especially when pastures are overgrazed. Another consideration specific for pregnant mares is that, in many parts of the world, horse pastures contain a high percentage of fescue and other grasses that may be infected with endophyte. Ball et al. (1991) noted that 90% of fescue samples (4,500 from 30 states) test- ed at Auburn University had some level of endophyte infection. Consumption of endophyte-infected tall fes- cue during late gestation can result in fescue toxicosis in broodmares, presenting as prolonged gestation, foal- ing difficulties, thickened placentas, and a decrease or absence of milk at delivery. Broodmares should be re- moved from fescue pastures at least 90 d before the es- timated foaling date. If broodmares cannot be removed 118 CHAPTER 8: HORSES Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020from fescue pastures, they may be supplemented with domperidone. Feed Containers Feed containers may be constructed of metal, plas- tic, rubber, concrete, wood, or any other material that is safe, sturdy, and cleanable. Hay may be fed from mangers, bags, nets, and racks or directly on the floor. Horses appear to prefer eating from the ground (Sweet- ing et al., 1985), and, in a properly cleaned environ- ment, relatively little danger exists of parasite trans- mission, although significant forage may be wasted. Eating in the head-down position facilitates drainage of the respiratory tract and minimizes inhalation of dust from feed. However, ground feeding of hay (especially outdoors in group-feeding situations) usually results in hay wastage, and concomitant ingestion of sand from sandy soils can lead to impaction colic. Hayracks or feeders may be beneficial in minimizing hay wastage and the ingestion of sand. Hayracks should be free of sharp edges and corners. The distance between the ground and bottom of the rack should accommodate a comfortable posture of the horses during eating when outdoors. Grain may be fed in buckets in the lower part of many hayracks or from separate troughs or boxes. Feed containers should per- mit the horse to insert its muzzle easily to the bottom of the container. Examples of acceptable dimensions of hay mangers and boxes have been published (MWPS, 2005). It is important to monitor feed containers daily to ensure that these are clean, free of moldy or wet feed, and not broken or damaged. Freestanding hayracks may also be used for groups of horses. These racks may be placed away from the fence or adjacent and perpendicular to the fence, allow- ing them to be filled from the other side of the fence. Drainage away from the feeder should be provided to minimize mud during rainy weather. Alternatively, feeders can be placed on aprons constructed of rubber, concrete, or other all-weather surfaces. Hay can also be placed in a large, stable container placed directly on the ground. The container should be cleaned out and spilled or soiled hay removed regularly. Creep feeders may be used for foals. These feeders may consist of an enclosure located in the pasture (usu- ally near the hay manger) with openings too small for adult horses to enter but large enough for foals to enter to allow feeding of rations formulated specifically for growing foals without competition from the adult hors- es. Creep feeders, like other feeders, should be clean, free of sharp protrusions, and in good repair, and the feed should be kept fresh. Feeding space for horses has not been well defined and may vary considerably depending on the size, num- ber, and temperament of the individuals that must eat from the same feeder simultaneously. Sufficient bunk space or feeding points should be provided to preclude excessive competition for feed. An extra feeding point (one more than the number of horses) reduces aggres- sion toward and stress upon the lower ranking of horses in the dominance hierarchy. This extra feeding point is particularly important if the feed ration is restricted. Alternatively, individual amounts of feed can be spaced far away from each other such that a horse cannot con- trol access without leaving an available pile. Hay racks that provide 1 m (3.3 ft) of eating space per animal and a continuous opportunity for consumption are usually placed down the center or long side of the pen or pad- dock (MWPS, 2005). The feeding of concentrate should be avoided in large groups, unless the horses are sepa- rated into individual feeding slip areas with head divid- ers or stalls to reduce competition by dominant horses (Holmes et al., 1987). There should be enough space between individual concentrate feeders for group-fed horses to feed but with minimal aggressive behaviors (Motch et al., 2007). Water It is recommended that clean water be freely acces- sible or provided free access at least twice daily if con- tinuous availability is not possible. The requirement for water depends on several factors such as environmental temperature, animal function, and diet composition. In general, mature horses in a moderate environment (20\u00b0C) require water in the range of 5 to 7 L/100 kg (5 to 7 qt per 220 lb) of BW per day (NRC, 2007). A horse fed to maintenance in a thermoneutral environ- ment may need 21 to 29 L (4 to 8 gal) daily, but a horse that is working and sweating or a lactating mare may need 50 to 100 L (12 to 25 gal) daily, especially in hot environments. Signs of dehydration are sunken eyes, tacky saliva, skin that tents (remains compressed when pinched), and increased capillary refill time at the gums. Horses should not be dehydrated unless the teaching or research requires so. Also, lack of adequate water may be a cause of colic. Watering devices used in pastures or corrals should be durable and require little maintenance. The water source should be clean and safe; water quality stan- dards and guidelines for horses are provided in the NRC (2007) publication. Waterers may vary from simple buckets to troughs or automatic drinking devices. Continuous flow systems may also be acceptable to prevent freezing and mod- erate temperature of drinking water. Waterers should be free of sharp edges. Automatic waterers must be functional, clean, and able to be operated by the hors- es. Some waterers can be operated by a pressure plate pressed by the horse; it may require several days for most horses to learn to operate this type of waterer, and foals or horses with very small muzzles may not be able to operate them. Also, the noise of some water- ers refilling may frighten some horses initially. A water bucket should be provided near the waterer until the horses are observed to operate the water device. Auto- matic waterers should be inspected daily to be certain 119 CHAPTER 8: HORSES Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020that they are operating properly and are free of foreign material. Water troughs should be cleaned as needed to prevent algae or dirt from accumulating. It is recom- mended that waterers be heated to prevent freezing in cold weather because provision of warm water increases intake in cold weather (Kristula and McDonnell, 1994). Proper installation of heating devices is necessary to prevent electrical shock. A float or stick may be placed in a trough to allow birds and other animals that fall into the trough to escape. Waterers should be posi- tioned in a manner to prevent horses from injuring one another. Several widely spaced waterers or a large wa- ter trough may be necessary in enclosures housing a large group of horses. HUSBANDRY Social Environment Horses are social animals that interact based on a dominance hierarchy within a herd structure. Horses develop strong attachments to herd-mates; the stron- gest bond is between a mare and her foal. Horses can adapt to different environments, from free roaming on large areas of pasture or rangeland to being confined in individual stalls. When separated from a group, hors- es may display restlessness, pacing, and vocalizations. Chronic social deprivation or isolation is a factor affect- ing the incidence of some locomotor stereotypies such as weaving, stall walking, and fenceline pacing (Mc- Greevy et al., 1995; Cooper et al., 2000; Bachmann et al., 2003). Careful selection of the horse's social en- vironment must be considered so as to not interfere with research and teaching objectives. Geldings may be housed with mares or broodmares and their foals with- out causing physical or behavioral indicators of reduced welfare (van Dierendonck et al., 2004). It is not recom- mended that more than one stallion be kept with a group of mares because aggression and play may result in injuries; stallions are often housed individually. Stal- lions should be housed and managed to reduce the po- tential for aggression, although they can be effectively managed in groups under certain circumstances (Chris- tensen et al., 2002; Briefer Freymond et al., 2013). Social hierarchies remain stable over time, with dominant mares maintaining their status even after re- productive senescence (Feh, 2005). Aggression is com- mon when unfamiliar horses are mixed and dominance relationships are uncertain. Biting and kicking can inflict serious damage during these agonistic interac- tions; for this reason, horses that are shod should be introduced into new herds with extra caution. In es- tablished groups, aggression increases when resources such as feed and space are limited (Heitor et al., 2006). In many facilities, horses are turned out as a group in pastures or paddocks during the day but are placed in individual stalls when they are fed. This approach ac- commodates individual feeding and minimizes aggres- sion. Introduction of an unfamiliar horse to a group should take place in daylight, when the horses can see the fences, and caretakers can observe the horses to de- tect injuries or deprivation of feed, water, or shelter of individual horses. Compatibility between neighboring individuals in stalls may depend on temperament in addition to social rank (Morris et al., 2002; Lloyd et al., 2007). Aggression between neighboring stabled horses is often expressed as threats, bar biting, or kicking of the stable walls. These behaviors can result in injury and damage to the horse or stable and are performed more frequently by mares than by geldings (Drissler et al., 2006). Horses exhibit a wide range of behavior and tempera- ment based on their breeding, training, age, sex, and past experiences. Horses are best managed with pre- dictable routines. Horses respond favorably to positive handling and can be acclimated to novel environments and procedures. A horse can be quite anxious when approached by an unfamiliar handler or while experi- encing a novel environment or research procedure. Be- cause horses have evolved as prey animals, their basic reaction to a threatening, painful, or stressful situation is to flee from the stressor. If a horse is confined or restrained during an unpleasant or novel situation, it is likely to fight using a variety of behaviors such as nip- ping, biting, kicking, rearing, or striking with a front foot. Visual contact with other horses is recommended to reduce the stress associated with isolation. Total iso- lation, even for a few hours, of a horse that previously lived in a group causes immune changes that may af- fect research results (Mal et al., 1991). There is little scientific information about auditory communication by horses and whether vocalizations affect the stress responses of neighboring horses. However, olfactory communication may be important for horses subject to novel environments or procedures. Management Observation and Daily Schedule. Horses should be observed carefully for health and well-being at least once daily. This observation can be done during feed- ing. Lack of appetite or other abnormal feeding be- haviors are excellent indications of problems. Horses maintained in large pastures where daily feeding is not routine benefit from daily observation to ensure their health and well-being. It is particularly important to check and monitor water sources for adequacy. Exercise. With proper husbandry, horses may be kept in an indoor stall for several months at a time if necessary, but those standing for prolonged periods in either box or tie stalls may develop edema of the lower limbs (stocking up) or abdomen, especially if elderly or pregnant. Behavioral problems such as stall walk- ing, weaving, and cribbing also are commonly thought to occur in confined horses. However, mares confined for up to 2 wk in tie-stalls for continuous urine col- lection were documented to exhibit fewer stereotypies 120 CHAPTER 8: HORSES Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020than observed in the general population (McDonnell et al., 1998). The need for controlled exercise or free time (turnout) is recognized. However, requirements for its frequency and duration have not been established by scientific studies for confined horses (McDonnell et al., 1998; Houpt and Houpt, 2000). It is recommended that horses confined to box stalls receive 30 min of free time (turnout) or 15 min of controlled exercise per day; horses in tie-stalls should be provided with more time for exercise. Grooming. Horses that are maintained in stalls are usually groomed daily. Horses maintained outdoors or in groups that have an opportunity to mutually groom each other and roll in clean dirt or grass do not nec- essarily require additional grooming. Horses that are maintained in dry lots that become muddy may require additional grooming to remove mud and fecal material. Hoof Care. Routine hoof care is important to the health and well-being of the horse. Daily hoof care is recommended for horses maintained in stalls or tie stalls. Hooves should be inspected and cleaned using a hoof pick or hoof knife to remove fecal and bedding material to prevent the development of infections. Hoof growth should be monitored, and hooves trimmed when the hoof wall becomes excessively long, cracked, or bro- ken. In general, this will occur in about 6 to 12 wk, although the exact timing is highly variable. Trimming of hooves should be done by trained personnel, because improper trimming can result in lameness. Teeth Floating. The upper and lower arcade of the horse's premolars and molars do not match. The up- per arcade sets slightly outside the lower arcade. As a result, during the normal wear process, sharp points develop on the outside of the upper molars and the inside of the lowers. These points are extremely sharp and may result in irritation of the cheeks and tongue of the horse. The horse may turn the head sideways while eating in an attempt to relieve the pressure from the affected tissue or may slobber feed while eating. The teeth may be examined by running the index finger along the top of the upper gum line and then care- fully lowering onto the outside of the upper molars. If sharp points exist, the teeth should be filed or \"floated\" with appropriate instruments (floats). The frequency of tooth floating depends on age, diet, housing, and envi- ronment. It is recommended that a veterinarian check teeth yearly or as needed. Horses that appear unthrifty, slobber feed, or exhibit other abnormal eating behavior should have their teeth examined and treated if needed. In general, very young and old horses require more at- tention to oral health programs and dental care. Preventative Health Care. Certain equine diseases are endemic and of concern in protecting the health of horses. The major diseases that horses should be vac- cinated against are Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), Western equine encephalitis (WEE), Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE), West Nile virus, rabies, and teta- nus. In certain areas of the United States, equine her-pesvirus myeloencephalopathy, botulism, and influenza may be significant risks that should be considered in development of a vaccination program. Appropriate vaccination schedules should be developed in consul- tation with the attending or facility's veterinarian. Pregnant mares require a specific vaccination program, which should be reviewed by a veterinarian. Addition- ally, when indicated or required by state or federal reg- ulations, disease monitoring and surveillance programs should be developed and implemented. Parasite Control. Control of internal and external parasites is extremely important in most horses. Fac- tors that affect internal parasite load include stocking density, age of horses, size and type of enclosures, en- vironment, and sanitation and other management pro- cedures. The major internal parasites that can severely affect horse health include but are not limited to large strongyles (e.g., Strongylus vulgaris), small Oxyuris equi). Regardless of load factors, however, a program of screening and treatment with an appropri- ate anthelminthic should be implemented. The class of drug used and timing of treatment varies with the type of internal parasite targeted and the exposure load. Consultation with the attending or facility's veterinar- ian is recommended. External parasites are generally less important than internal parasites but can affect the horse's health if present in sufficient numbers. Ticks, lice, and mites are the most common external parasites and they can be easily detected and controlled with an appropriate drug, in consultation with a veterinarian. The incidence of tick-borne diseases, such as Lyme disease, is increas- ing across the United States. Proper pasture manage- ment may help decrease the exposure to ticks, but no vaccine is currently available for horses (Divers et al., 2018). Flying Insect Control. The 2 most common flying pests are flies and mosquitoes. The stable fly and the house fly are the most common species of flies. House flies are primarily a nuisance as they lack biting mouth- parts, but they can be present in sufficient numbers to negatively affect the comfort of horses. Stable flies, deer flies, and mosquitoes do present a significant risk of dis- ease transmission because they have biting mouthparts and feed on blood. They can serve as transmission vec- tors of blood-borne diseases such as equine infectious anemia and West Nile virus. Control of flying insects begins with sanitation. Ma- nure, wasted feed, consistently wet areas, and standing water provide excellent breeding areas for flying insects and should be managed accordingly. Elimination of in- sect breeding areas to the extent possible should be the primary concern. If sanitation does not provide suf- ficient control, use of other methods may be required. Fly traps, fly baits, use of pyrethroids (synthetic or natural), use of larvicides on standing water, and re-121 CHAPTER 8: HORSES Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020lease of parasitic wasps are all acceptable methods of controlling flying insects. Prolonged use of chemical treatments may result in resistant populations of flying insects. An integrated pest management approach to control is preferred. Breeding Procedures. Pasture breeding, live cover (in-hand), and artificial insemination (AI) are all ap- propriate methods of breeding mares, and all can re- sult in acceptable conception rates. Pasture breeding requires the least intensive management. The pasture needs to be of an appropriate size so that submissive mares can retreat from dominant mares or the stallion. Also, breeding horses should not be present in adjacent areas. Live cover (in-hand) and AI require additional management skills and should only be attempted by personnel who are appropriately trained and under- stand the behavioral characteristics of both stallions and mares during the breeding season. Although the breeding of mares is not a sterile procedure, proper hygiene should be observed during AI procedures. All equipment should be kept clean and in good repair, and facilities should be constructed such that risk of injury to horses and personnel are minimized. Foaling Management. Mares can be managed exten- sively or intensively during the foaling process. Parturi- tion in mares is normally uneventful. In multiparous mares, the process often occurs in less than 30 min. However, when problems occur, they require immediate attention and action. As a result of an artificially ma- nipulated breeding season, many mares foal in January, February, and March, when the weather in many parts of the United States is less than ideal. In extremely cold weather, foaling inside is preferable. Indoor foaling stalls should be larger than the normal box stall and easily accommodate the ambulatory movements and lateral recumbent positions of the mare during parturi- tion, and subsequently provide ample space to avoid injuries to the mare and her foal. In more temperate weather, foaling outside is acceptable. An important consideration is that the enclosure used is free from ob- jects that could injure the mare or foal if they lie down or fall. The walls of the stall or fence (in the case of an outdoor paddock) should be constructed such that the mare's legs cannot become entangled when she lies down to foal. Most mares foal after dark. Mares should be grouped by expected foaling date and observed closely at the evening feeding. The presence of a waxy substance on the end of the teats may indicate that the mare is with- in 24 to 36 h of foaling. Maiden mares, however, may not exhibit this classic sign. The onset of parturition is signified by strong abdominal contractions followed by presentation of the water bag. Once the water bag breaks, the foal's front hooves should be visible, with the soles of the hooves pointed downward (toward the mare's legs). The foal's nose should be positioned on top of the front legs just above the fetlocks. Any pre- sentation other than described here is an indication of a malpresentation and is cause for concern. If the foaling attendant(s) is(are) not experienced in handling emer- gency obstetric situations, a qualified veterinarian or their designee should be called immediately. If the presentation of the foal is normal, the mare should be left alone until the foal has been delivered and the umbilical cord has been broken. The umbilical stump should be treated with a dilute iodine solution (0.1% solution) or chlorhexidine (1:4) to prevent intro- duction of pathogenic bacteria into the foal's body. The foal should be allowed to stand and nurse on its own without interference. This process allows the mare and foal to recognize each other and to bond. This process can take an hour or more. If the foal has not stood and nursed within 2 h, assistance may be required. At 8 to 12 h after foaling, the foal can be tested for the presence of antibodies absorbed from colostrum. There appears to be good correlation between the concentration of antibodies from colostrum and the health of foals dur- ing the first 6 wk of life. If the mare does not produce adequate colostrum, frozen colostrum may be available from large breeding farms, but feeding colostrum to the foal more than 12 to 24 h after birth is usually ineffec- tive. In cases of a failure of transfer of passive immunity from colostrum, transfusion of plasma from hyperim- munized donors may be advisable. The mare's placenta should be tied up in a way that she will not step on it after foaling, and it should be passed within the first couple of hours after foaling. After the placenta has been delivered, the foaling at- tendant should examine the placenta to ensure that it is complete and that no pieces have been retained. Re- tention of the placenta by the mare more than 3 h post- foaling is considered a medical emergency. A qualified veterinarian should be called to assist in resolving the situation. Endometritis, septicemia, and laminitis are common secondary occurrences when a mare retains the placenta. Restraint. Proper restraint of horses is an important management skill that is critical to the health and well- being of both the handler and the horse. Restraint can be as simple as putting a horse in a pen to restrict its range of movement or as complex as the use of chemical restraint to perform a surgical procedure. As a general rule, the handler should use the minimal amount of re- straint necessary to perform the procedure. Regardless of the restraint used, it should be correctly and appro- priately applied. Below is a list of acceptable restraint methods and a description of the proper application of each. Pens should be constructed of material that is of suf- ficient strength to contain the horse. Material should have no sharp points or edges. Pipe, smooth cable, PVC fencing, wooden planks, and woven wire are all appropriate materials. Stalls should be constructed of material that is of sufficient strength to contain the horse. The lower por- tion should be of solid construction and of sufficient 122 CHAPTER 8: HORSES Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020height that the horse's legs cannot become entangled. Wood planking and concrete are examples of appropri- ate materials. Halters may be constructed of rope, nylon webbing, other synthetic materials, or leather. These should fit tightly enough that the crown piece will not slide down the neck but be loose enough that the horse can chew comfortably. It is recommended that horses not be turned loose in a pasture or stall with a halter on unless the halter is made such that it will break away should the horse become entangled. If a horse is to be tied with a lead rope attached to the halter, several factors must be considered: (1) the horse should be tied at wither height or above; (2) a quick-release mechanism should be in place; (3) the horse should be tied to something that will not become detached or move; and (4) there should be no objects in the immediate area that could injure or entangle the horse. Front foot hobbles are a traditional form of restraint used to allow horses to graze on the open range without running off. If used, hobbles should be constructed of leather or soft cotton rope. These are applied to the front feet only and should only be used on horses that have been trained to them. Horses that have not been trained to hobbles may have a violent reaction to them when first applied. Front foot hobbles should not be ap- plied in confined spaces where the horse may be injured by running or falling into a fence, wall, or other object. Sidelines or breeding hobbles are used to prevent a horse from kicking with the hind legs. As the name im- plies, they are used to protect a stallion when mount- ing a mare during breeding or during collection for AI. These are sometimes used to restrain the horse when trimming feet or when training a horse for riding. Hobbles should be constructed of leather or soft cotton rope to prevent abrasion injuries during application. Horses that have not been trained to sidelines or breed- ing hobbles may have a violent reaction to them when first applied. Hobbles should not be applied in confined spaces where the horse may be injured by running into or falling into a fence, wall, or other object. Leg straps are used to hold one front leg off the ground by flexing a front leg and placing the strap around the forearm and cannon bone. Leg straps are applied by trained individuals primarily to keep the horse from moving forward and to encourage them to stand still. The strap should be made of leather or soft cotton rope to prevent abrasion injury. Horses that have not been trained to leg straps may have a violent reaction to them when first applied. These should not be applied in confined spaces where the horse may be injured by run- ning into or falling into a fence, wall, or other object. Twitches are used to immobilize horses for short procedures where movement of the horse prevents the accomplishment of the task. Twitches are generally ap- plied to the upper lip of the horse and then tightened. This usually results in the horse standing immobile de- spite even moderately uncomfortable procedures such as rectal palpation or insertion of nasogastric tubes. Twitches come in many types, from the so-called hu- mane twitch constructed like a large pair of smooth pliers to wooden handles with rope or chain attached to the end. Regardless of the type, the upper lip is grasped and placed in the loop of the twitch, which is then tightened by clamping or twisting. When used correctly, twitches are a safe and effective method of short-term restraint that can often be used in lieu of chemical restraint. When used incorrectly, twitches are dangerous to both the horse and the handler. Horses may have a violent reaction to twitches when they are improperly used or left in place for too long. Chemical restraint is necessary for many surgical procedures and may be necessary for some nonsurgical procedures. Chemical restraint should be used when other types of restraint are inappropriate or inadequate because of the duration or stress of the procedure. In these cases, it is recommended that protocols be de- veloped in consultation with a veterinarian. Improper application of chemical restraint can result in injury or death of the horse and presents a safety hazard to the handler. STANDARD AGRICUL TURAL PRACTICES Permanent identification of individual horses may be done by insertion of microchips or lip tattoos. Horses should not be branded unless legally required. Prop- er restraint\u2014physical, chemical, or both\u2014should be used to ensure proper application of the brand and to safeguard the handler and horse during the process. The resultant wounds should be monitored for infec- tion (Lindegaard et al., 2009). For microchip insertion, tranquilization is usually not necessary, but numbing the insertion site with lidocaine may be indicated. The insertion site midway between the poll and withers in the nuchal ligament should be clipped and surgically scrubbed before insertion to prevent infections. Lip tat- toos are traditionally done on the inside surface of the upper lip and do not require chemical restraint. Castration may be performed on horses at any age from a few weeks to many years of age. Surgical cas- tration is performed with the horse standing or in re- cumbency. Anesthesia, provided by trained personnel, is essential at all ages. Horses should be carefully moni- tored post-surgery for infection or herniation of bow- el through the castration site. Appropriate analgesia should be used following castration surgery. Harnesses, saddles, or other equipment necessary for research and teaching purposes should be properly fitted for each individual horse, such that the equip- ment does not cause uneven pressure or injury, or rub sores. Horses being exercised should be offered water at regular intervals, and the duration of actual work should take into account climatic condition, fitness of the horse, and physical demands. Chronic signs of pain or distress in horses can in- clude lameness, weight loss, hair loss or open sores, loss of appetite, repeated flight attempts or aggression, 123 CHAPTER 8: HORSES Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020and depression. Acutely painful or stressed horses may show elevated heart and respiratory rates, inappropri- ate sweating (not heat or exercise induced), repetitive rolling on the ground, groaning, teeth grinding, pinned ears, clenched jaw, increased horse grimace score (Dalla Costa et al., 2014), restlessness, tucked-up posture, and other signs of abdominal pain (Kaiser et al., 2006; Mills et al., 2007). Common causes of pain and distress in horses include social isolation, lack of adequate feed or water, improperly fitting harness or equipment caus- ing pressure or friction, improper handling or restraint, prolonged transportation (Stull et al., 2004), and re- peated invasive research procedures such as venipunc- ture, intravenous catheterization, and muscle biopsies. ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT Refer to Chapter 4: Environmental Enrichment for information on enrichment of horse environments. HANDLING AND TRANSPORT Refer to Chapter 5: Animal Handling and Trans- port for information on handling and transportation of horses. EUTHANASIA Personnel who perform euthanasia of horses must be trained in the appropriate protocols and in humane handling and restraint techniques; they must also be knowledgeable about safety concerns associated with each euthanasia method. Euthanasia of horses can be performed using the intravenous administration of pen- tobarbital or a pentobarbital combination, gunshot, or captive bolt gun. Pentobarbital is controlled by the US Food and Drug Administration; thus, only a US Drug Enforcement Agency license holder or their designee is able to use it for euthanasia. Usually a catheter is placed in the jugular vein to facilitate the large volume of solution that must be used. Barbiturates adminis- tered too slowly or in insufficient amounts may cause sudden or violent falling and thrashing of the horse. Thus, the use of sedatives or tranquilizers (e.g., xyla- zine, detomidine, or acetylpromazine) before the intra- administration of pentobarbital can provide a more controlled recumbency process, which may also be safer for the personnel handling the horse. However, the use of sedatives and tranquilizers before administration of pentobarbital may prolong the time to unconscious- ness because of their effect (i.e., bradycardia, hypoten- sion) on the circulatory system (AVMA, 2020). In emergency situations, or if the use of drugs is con- traindicated for any reason, a gun or a penetrating cap- tive bolt gun may be used by trained personnel. For gunshot, a 0.22-caliber long rifle or larger is recom- mended, but a 9-mm or 0.38-caliber handgun will be effective for most horses. The optimal site for penetra-tion of the skull is at the intersection of the line from the base of the ear to the outside corner of the opposite eye or, more specifically stated, one-half inch above the intersection of a diagonal line from the base of the ear to the inside corner of the opposite eye (diagram avail- able from the American Veterinary Medical Association online; www.avma.org). Personnel must comply with laws and regulations governing the possession and dis- charge of firearms; local ordinances may prohibit the discharge of firearms in certain areas. A penetrating captive bolt gun fires a blank cartridge that propels a steel bolt into the brain, producing immediate brain destruction. Proper selection of the cartridge strength should be appropriate for the size of the horse and var- ies between manufacturers. The site of entry for the projectile is the same as for gunshot. Because the cap- tive bolt device must be held firmly against the area of penetration on the head, horses must be adequately restrained. The advantage of a captive bolt procedure is that is does not fire a free bullet, and therefore may be safer for personnel. Confirmation of death is essential using any eutha- nasia method. The horse should be checked for at least 5 min to confirm death by monitoring its vital signs. Death is confirmed by the lack of breathing, heartbeat, and corneal reflex. Additional euthanasia procedures should be initiated if there is any evidence of responsive vital signs. When practical, choose a location for euthanasia procedures where the carcass can be removed easily by equipment, but do not drag animals or cause more pain and distress to move the animal to a convenient place. In these circumstances, the animal should be eu- thanized in place and dragged after it is dead. Animal carcasses should be disposed of promptly, usually by a commercial rendering company or other appropriate means (burial, landfill, incineration, or possibly com- posting or biodigestion) in accordance with all federal, state, and local regulations. Some local regulations may not allow burial, and rendering services may not accept carcasses containing pentobarbital or other medica- tions. Limit the access of carcasses to scavenging ani- mals, because residues of pentobarbital may remain in the carcass. REFERENCES Andrews, F. M., and J. A. Nadeau. 1999.

The level of man- agement applied should be commensurate with the requirements of the production system to assure pig comfort. In certain systems, more stockmanship may be necessary to meet the needs of pigs. Specific atten- tion should be paid to management of effective environ- mental temperature, sun exposure, ventilation, vapor pressure, floor condition, area or space per pig, manure management, quantity and quality of feed (i.e., appro- priate diet) and water, housing system, disease, and distress. Predictable daily management allows pigs to develop a routine. Animal care personnel should plan for swine management under climatic extremes and emergency conditions; personnel should be able to provide appro- priate husbandry to minimize environmental stressors and animal distress. Animal care staff should be famil- iar with the behavior of normal pigs and those experi- encing stress or reduced well-being. Attention should be given to the environment, age of the animals, and pig dunging and resting areas of preference during both the design phase and the daily operation of facilities. Movement of manure and urine between pens should be minimized. Similarly, animal care personnel should take necessary precautions to decrease transmission of pathogens between pens and between facilities, even at the same location. PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT The microenvironment consists of all factors external to the animal: environment (air temperature, quality, movement, and moisture), physical environment (pens, walls, and floors), social environment (access to other animals), and microbial environment. The thermal en- vironment is probably one of the most difficult compo- nents to manage because pigs of different age have dif- ferent thermal requirements. Hence, it is important that pigs be managed based on their thermal needs during each stage of production (Table 9-1). The lower critical temperature is higher for younger pigs than for older pigs; thus, a higher effective environmental tempera- ture is required. When possible, the thermal environ- ment should be managed so that the microenvironment is maintained close to the zone of thermal neutrality for the age of the pig being housed (Table 9-1). Note that although specific ranges are provided, footnote 1 in Table 9-1 emphasizes the need to base requirements on swine behavior and physiology, not simply within a broad range, because many factors, including radiant heat load, air speed, relative humidity, health, stage of production/gestation, can affect animal comfort. Ventilation goals differ with season. A properly venti- lated building is free of drafts and provides clean, fresh air without chilling the pigs. Minimal ventilation rate should be achieved in the winter, with air exchange be- ing at its lowest rate but still efficient enough to remove moisture. Excessive moisture (>80% relative humidity) provides a vehicle for microorganisms, condenses on the pigs, and damages insulation. Ventilation rate in winter should not fall below 6 air changes per hour. In con- junction with minimum ventilation rate, relative hu- midity and CO 2 are important measures of air quality; one or both factors should be considered when control- ling ventilation rate (Kephart, 2007). Ventilation rate in the summer should be sufficient to keep air moving to remove animal heat and moisture. LIGHTING The domestic pig is less sensitive to its photic envi- ronment than are some other species. Changes in pho- toperiod have not been linked to pig well-being because no consistent or decisive evidence has been presented linking photoperiod to pig performance at any stage of production. Some data indicate that photoperiod can influence productivity and various physiological mea- sures of sows and their offspring (Bruininx et al., 2002; Niekamp et al., 2006, 2007; H\u00e4lli et al., 2008). Reiners et al. (2010) found no effect of increased photoperiod on feed disappearance or body weight (BW) of weaned pigs. In the wild, swine do not depend on vision as much as on other sensory systems (Kilgour, 1985), but if pigs are able to control the photoperiod for them- selves, they prefer some light and some dark every hour of the day and night (Baldwin and Meese, 1977). This CHAPTER 9: SWINE 127apparent light-dark cycle preference is not similar to any natural situation; thus, this type of preference test may not be the best mechanism to determine the light requirements for swine. Photoperiod manipulation may influence pig immune status (Niekamp et al., 2006, 2007), but data on pho- toperiodic effects on pig biology are contradictory for growing pigs (Berger et al., 1980). H\u00e4lli et al. (2008) found that photoperiod had no effect on changes in luteinizing hormone in prepubertal gilts. However, re- search by others found that developing breeding ani- mals may benefit from a long-day photoperiod as evi- denced by advanced puberty (e.g., 16 h of light and 8 h of dark; Zimmerman et al., 1980; Wheelhouse and Hacker, 1982). Gilts managed on long days had higher basal concentrations of luteinizing hormone than did those on short days. When photoperiod increased by 1 h, age to estrus decreased by 3 d (albeit a very weak as- sociation, r = 0.03; Tummaruk, 2012) and age to first mating decreased by 1 d (Iida and Koketsu, 2013). Sea- sonal infertility has been a longstanding problem in the swine industry. Photoperiod in late gestation can also influence endocrine and performance measures of the gestating sow and her offspring (Niekamp et al., 2006). Auvigne et al. (2010), studying 610,000 sows in France, found a significant role of photoperiod contributing to seasonal infertility with the compounding challenge of heat stress. Lactating sows responded positively to 16 h of light and 8 h of darkness, resulting in enhanced pig- let performance, and some studies have reported that these sows may return to estrus sooner (Mabry et al., 1982, 1983; Stevenson et al., 1983). These effects were not observed in a subsequent study using more replica- tions (McGlone et al., 1988). Light regimens oscillating from 9 to 16 h of light daily had no effect on boar se- men quality, fertility, prolificacy, or libido (Rivera et al., 2006; Sancho et al., 2006). Although there are times that a specific light cycle may be a beneficial manage- ment tool for pigs, changes in photoperiod have not been linked to sow or boar well-being. FEED AND WATER Pigs should be observed and their well-being assessed at least once each day. Feeders and waterers must be checked for functionality. Design and position of feed- ers and waterers should enable easy access while mini- mizing waste. Feeders or feeding places should be free from manure, urine, and other contaminants. Pigs may be fed on the floor if care is taken to prevent manure build-up and ensure individuals are getting enough feed. Medication under veterinary prescription may be administered through a waterer for management of bacterial pneumonia, enteric, and nonenteric infections and as appropriate for nutrient supplementation. Care should be taken to minimize dust when deliver- ing feed to buildings that house animals. Pigs should be fed to meet or exceed nutrient requirements, as de- termined by the NRC (2012), for their particular stage of the life cycle. Pigs should have ad libitum access to water or, at a minimum, adequate scheduled access to water. Quality and quantity of water should be suf- ficient to limit the incidence of illness and meet the physiological needs of pigs.Table 9-1.

When pigs are in a comfortable thermal setting, they will rest comfortably, not shiver or pile on one another, not have an elevated respiratory rate, and will generally rest touching other pigs. Some individual pigs may prefer to rest alone. Piling or spreading out widely may indicate the environment is too cold or too warm, respectively. Pig thermoregulatory behaviors are better indicators of the appropriate air temperature than a thermometer. PQA, 2019: https://lms.pork.org/Tools/View/pqa-plus/program-materials . It is important to realize that how the animal feels is based on temperature combined with radiant heat load, air speed, and relative humidity. 2Based on values given by NRC (1981), DeShazer and Overhults (1982), Curtis (1985), Hahn (1985), and Shao et al. (1997). 3Values represent lower extremes in air temperature when pigs are held in groups. Bedding is recommended when air temperature approaches the lower extreme. 4Except for brief periods above these air temperatures, cooling should be provided by means such as evaporatively cooled air for growing pigs or a water drip for lactating sows. There is no practical upper limit for the creep area for piglets. 5With the combination of \"sow or boar\" into one category, physiological changes (i.e., gestation and lactation) that can impact the preferred temperature range of a sow as metabolic heat production changes have not been consid- ered. For example, metabolic heat production of ad libitum-fed lactating sows at 25\u00b0C may differ from early gestation sows fed at maintenance requirement, etc., which can alter thermal preferences. These and other differences should be considered. Therefore, these ranges do not consider the actual preferred range or upper extreme for gestating and/or lactating sows. 128 CHAPTER 9: SWINE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020HOUSING TYPES Young pigs and sows are social animals and are usu- ally housed in groups. In nature, wild sows are often found in groups, except before and after parturition when they seek isolation. Older boars should be housed individually to reduce aggression and fighting. Young pigs show behavioral and physiological signs of stress when held in complete isolation from other pigs. Hence, pigs housed individually should be able to see and hear other pigs. The precise relationship between group size and pig performance is neither predictable nor clear (Livings- ton et al., 1969; Patterson, 1985). Growing pigs are commonly kept in groups from 2 to 1,200 pigs per pen but large numbers of pigs per pen (1,000 to 1,200) have become more common, especially in commercial wean-to-finish systems. When social groups are being established, the level of stress (fighting) increases sig- nificantly during the initial 24 to 48 h after the animals are introduced, and productivity may temporarily de- cline until social status is established. The group of- ten becomes relatively stable if external stressors are managed effectively. Therefore, whenever establishing groups or introducing new animals into an established group, care should be taken to monitor the pigs to promptly identify any individuals that become severely hurt. Methods to reduce aggression are usually short lived but can include mixing groups in the evening, adopting strategies that minimize competition (e.g., grouping pigs of similar size, increasing access to water, providing access to ad libitum feed through a variety of feeding techniques or multiple stations, providing ad- ditional space), providing sprinklers and supplemental ventilation to reduce heat load when environmental conditions are warm, and providing other forms of en- vironmental enrichment (e.g., straw, large plastic balls, springs mounted on vertical sections of tubular gates, suspended waterers, toys). By comparison, use of chem- ical deterrents (e.g., pheromones or odors) and fresh bedding to mask olfactory triggers of aggression has proven unsuccessful (Marchant-Forde and Marchant- Forde, 2005). Adding bedding such as straw is not possi- ble with some types of flooring, especially over pits that collect manure. Movable panels and partial walls that serve as visual barriers and hiding places for animals to escape aggression have been proposed to moderate aggression. However, recent research suggests that even though these structures appear to decrease stress, they do not decrease aggression (Bulens et al., 2017). When mixing sows, parity, size, genetics etc. should be consid- ered. Extremely aggressive or timid sows may need to be culled (National Pork Board, 2018; PQA, 2019). In some cases, adult pigs housed individually may experi- ence less stress than growing pigs because they are not the recipients of overt aggression. As noted above, if the research requires pigs to be housed individually, such as in metabolic studies or gestation stalls, the animals should be able to see and or hear other pigs.FARROWING SYSTEMS Sow Management Before preparturient sows are moved for farrowing, the environment should be cleaned, disinfected, and dried. If farrowing outdoors, it is recommended that the outdoor environmental area be exposed to sunlight for several days before moving a new group of sows into the area for farrowing to allow UV light to assist in disinfecting the area. If parasites are present, sows should be treated appropriately to eliminate trans- mission of parasites into the farrowing area. Diets fed during lactation differ from those fed during gestation (NRC, 2012), and fresh water should be available at all times. Laxative additives or a specially formulated diet may be fed before or after parturition to minimize constipation. In high-producing herds, Hoshino et al. (2009) found that increased assistance and supervision during far- rowing decreased the incidence of stillbirths. However, Vanderhaeghe et al. (2010b) found that an increased incidence of vaginal palpation increased stillbirths, but this has not been verified with various types of genet- ics. Housing environment may also affect the number of stillbirths. Numerous studies have been carried out with mixed results; only the research reported by Oliv- iero et al. (2010) found that sows housed in farrowing crates had more stillbirths than sows in pens (1.0 vs. 0.4). Behavioral thermoregulation of sows is necessary because they do not perspire and hence may include postural changes. Sows may exhibit extension of their body for contact with a cooler surface, shade seeking, minimizing contact with other animals, or open-mouth breathing (Curtis, 1983; Blackshaw and Blackshaw, 1994). Because sows have a high BW but a low body surface-to-mass ratio, it is difficult for sows to dissi- pate internal heat (Hansen and Vestergaard, 1984). Sows housed at temperatures >22\u00b0C (>72\u00b0F) have been found to have a higher incidence of stillbirths (Vander- haeghe et al., 2010a). During hot weather, especially when humidity is high [daily maximum temperature >29\u00b0C (>85\u00b0F)], sows may need to be zone cooled with misters, sprinklers, dripping water directly on the sow, ventilation fans (McGlone et al., 1988), or by providing directed currents of air on the nose (Bull et al., 1997). Effective thermoregulatory methods that can be used in extensive or outdoor systems include enabling sows to wet themselves with water or mud, access to shade, or manually misting sows with room-temperature wa- ter. Confinement Before Farrowing Jensen (1988) proposed that maternal behavior can be divided into 6 distinct parts: (1) isolation and nest- site seeking, (2) nest building, (3) farrowing, (4) nest occupation, (5) social integration, and (6) weaning. Iso-129 CHAPTER 9: SWINE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020lation and nest-site seeking behaviors observed in wild, feral, and domestic sows outdoors occur 24 to 48 h before the birth of the first piglet. The sow often leaves the social group and seeks isolation. Therefore, some degree of confinement of the periparturient sow allows her to occupy a space that is precluded to others (Phil- lips et al., 1991). Even in extensive housing systems, sows may be provided with small houses, huts, or a pen in which they can be confined and excluded from their group. Housing A wide variety of options are available for housing sows during farrowing and lactation, ranging from con- ventional stalls to outdoor pens or paddocks (Collins et Thornton, Johnson and Marchant-Forde, 2008). Farrowing systems should be designed to meet performance stan- dards that include minimizing preweaning piglet mor- tality, providing thermal comfort for sow and piglets (which may require zone heating/cooling), providing a sanitary environment for sows and piglets, and accom- modating normal sow and piglet behaviors where pos- sible. Restricting sow movements in the well-designed farrowing stall will improve piglet survival, and this is a significant consideration when selecting any farrowing system. Farrowing Stalls To reduce piglet injury and protect animal care personnel from overly aggressive periparturient sows, indoor sows may be confined in farrowing stalls or freestalls from d 109 of gestation until the piglets are weaned (Curtis, 1995). A variety of farrowing stalls are available. The standard farrowing stall is usually a tu- bular metal construction fixed within a pen of about 2.2 m \u00d7 1.5 m (7.2 ft \u00d7 4.9 ft), with recommended dimensions of around 2.2 m long, 0.6 m wide, and 1.0 m high (7.2 ft long, 1.97 ft wide, and 3.28 ft high). The length and height of the farrowing stall must be ap- propriate for the sow's size. A sow must be able to rest comfortably in the farrowing stall without the need for her head to rest on a feeder due to inadequate length of stall. Most farrowing stall floors are slatted or perforated so that sows and piglets are effectively and quickly sep- arated from their excreta, and the environment dries quickly. Acceptable types of slatted floors include per- forated metal, woven metal, plastic-coated metal, metal bars, fiberglass, concrete, and combinations of materi- als. The floor surface should be nonabrasive, nonpo- rous, and not slippery (Fritschen and Muehling, 1984). Slots between slats should be wide enough to allow ex- creta to pass through, but not allow piglets to get their feet caught in the flooring.Rubber mats may be provided in the creep area for the first few weeks. Floor materials should be free of exposed or projecting materials to avoid injury to the leg, foot, or hoof. Bedding can be provided for farrow- ing crates equipped with solid floors. Flooring materi- als should meet performance requirements so that (1) animals are supported and slippage is reduced, (2) slat- ted floors do not trap feet or legs, (3) slats provide a clean environment by separating the manure from the animals, (4) floors in combination with other features of the room should provide thermal comfort, and (5) floors can be sanitized to provide a clean surface. Good disease management practices dictate that all sows should enter and leave the farrowing accommo- dation at the same time (all-in, all-out) and thus the number of farrowing places in a room should be related to the number of sows that are due to farrow in a given cycle. The partitions between the pens should be high enough to prevent piglets from escaping. Indoor Farrowing Pens Farrowing pens may be used for sows and litters. Ac- ceptable indoor pen designs include ellipsoid farrow- ing crates (Lou and Hurnik, crates (McGlone and Blecha, 1987; Heckt et al., 1988), rectangular pens with side rails that allow piglet escape (McGlone and Blecha, 1987; Blackshaw and Blackshaw, 1994), and or walls and Cro- nin et al., 1996; Marchant-Forde, 2002). Turn-around pens, that allow a sow to turn around, are similar to conventional stalls in that they are made out of tubular metal and the system incorporates a piglet creep area. However, there are increased issues with sows defecat- ing or urinating in their feed. These systems must be installed on a fully slatted floor for hygiene reasons. Farrowing Houses or Huts As with indoor farrowing pens, some outdoor farrow- ing houses or huts allow sows to raise piglets with mini- mum preweaning mortality. Farrowing huts or houses are enclosures used for outdoor farrowing. A variety of designs are available, often made of plastic, wood or tin. These include housing of different shapes and de- sign, such as A-frame, semicircular, and rectangular de- signs (Penner et al., 1996; Honeyman and Roush, 1997; Johnson and Marchant-Forde, 2008). It is common to use bedding such as straw, wood shavings, or other ma- terials. Often there is no heated creep area because of concerns about fire, and no water supply for the sow or her litter is provided within the structure due to the portability of the structure. Some farrowing huts/ houses may have insulation to reduce extremes of tem- perature, although the benefits of insulation have been questioned in controlled studies (Edwards and Furniss, 1988; Johnson and McGlone, 2003).130 CHAPTER 9: SWINE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020Fences can be fixed onto the front of farrowing huts/ houses to help keep piglets close to the farrowing unit, keep bedding inside, and allow unrestricted movement of the sow (Honeyman et al., 1998; Johnson and Mc- Glone, 2003). Fence design may influence the length of time that piglets are confined to the hut/house and safety for the stockperson carrying out routine tasks (i.e., litter processing; Johnson and McGlone, 2003). For instance, fences that are low will eventually be inef- fective in keeping the litter in the sow's vicinity. Sows kept outdoors should be observed daily. A shel- tered area or bedding should be provided unless the thermal environment is adequate, and fences should be sturdy and well constructed. Electrified wire may be used to keep animals confined. Proper health care for sows and piglets should be provided, and feces and urine should be removed from the immediate environ- ment as the need arises. Sows and litters kept outdoors can be rotated among pastures to avoid accumulation of pathogens and parasites; if not, increased parasite control measures can help decrease parasitic load. As noted previously, the farrowing houses/huts or pens should be cleaned and disinfected before each use. If sows farrow outdoors, appropriate sanitation proce- dures (e.g., moving huts and burning bedding) should be followed to ensure a clean farrowing environment. Creep Area An area of safety for the young pigs away from the sow is called the creep area, and it is usually set to the side or front of the farrowing stall, with a heat source to provide a warm lying area. In a pen or house, the creep area may be in one corner, along one of the pen's short sides, or centrally placed in pens that are divided into nesting and dunging areas (Heckt et al., 1988; Johnson and Marchant-Forde, 2008). Litter Management Newborn piglets require special attention. They are born with low body reserves of energy, iron, and immu- noglobulins. Newborn piglets also thermoregulate poor- ly and are vulnerable to being crushed. Until weaned, piglets should be provided with an area that is warm, dry, draft-free, and zone heated in cold environments when possible; piglets should be protected from being crushed or injured by the sow. The lower critical temperature of the piglet is about 35\u00b0C (95\u00b0F) at birth (Table 9-1). However, the entire space in the house should not be heated to an air tem- perature approaching the lower critical temperature of the piglets because the sow will become heat-stressed. Zone heating, zone cooling, or both, can be provided to meet the differing thermal needs of the sow and piglets. Any of the following procedures may be performed on piglets within a few days after birth: (1) navel disin- fected with iodine (if farrowing was attended); (2) nee- dle teeth trimmed with a disinfected sharp device; (3) tail docked to 1.5 to 2.5 cm (0.5 to 1 in) from the body with a disinfected device (NPB, 2018); (4) supplemen- tal iron injected in neck area muscle; and (5) individual identification (usually ear notches or small ear tags). NURSERY SYSTEMS Weaning is a practice that causes distress to the pig because of the sudden change in social and environmen- tal conditions and dietary change. Weaning at night may be less stressful than weaning during the early morning (Ogunbameru et al., 1992); however, the lat- ter is often not practical. Typically, nursery systems have included housing and management arrangements for newly weaned pigs until 8 or 9 wk of age, but it is now common to wean pigs directly into a wean-to-finish building. Piglets may be weaned at any age, but the younger the piglets are at weaning, the greater the need for specialized facilities and care, a higher degree of sanita- tion, and more costly, high-quality diets (Lecce, 1986; Owen et al., 1995). Typically, in the North American swine industry today, pigs are weaned at 15 to 20 d of age. Segregated early weaning is a production practice used from time to time to reduce the incidence of dis- ease and to improve pig health and well-being in herds with chronic disease. In a segregated early weaning sys- tem, piglets are weaned at 10 to 20 d of age and then transported to a facility that is geographically sepa- rated from other swine facilities (Dewey, 1995). This management practice reduces the transfer of disease microorganisms from sows to nursery pigs by removing piglets from the sow before passive immunity decreases and the sow can infect her offspring. Segregated early weaning is less effective for some diseases but works well for others. However, segregated early weaning is not a routine, ongoing management practice. The lower critical temperature of a 4-wk-old pig (once it is eating at a rate of approximately 3 to 3.5 times thermoneutral maintenance) is around 26\u00b0C (79\u00b0F; Table 9-1); therefore, nurseries should be able to meet the ambient temperature needs of the weaned pig, which may (but not always) require supplemental heat- ing equipment such a heat lamps, mats, or bedding for solid floors. If piglets continue nursing the sow beyond 3 wk of age so they derive heat from the sow or when deep bedding is used to create a microenvironment in the range of thermoneutrality, then supplemental heat may not be required in a nursery building. The key is to provide an environment that meets the thermal com- fort needs of the pigs. Ventilation is essential to limit moisture accumula- tion in the winter and heat in the summer. Hence, it uses the flow of air, to influence the environment and ultimately comfort. Included in this system are the fans, inlets, heaters, and controllers. An example of a ventilation system is shown in Table 9-2. Environmen- tal management is critical to the success of raising pigs in wean-to-finish buildings. Ventilation initially needs 131 CHAPTER 9: SWINE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020to be similar to that of the farrowing facility to allow newly weaned pigs to adjust to the phase of produc- tion. As the pig grows, it produces more moisture and heat; hence, ventilation needs change. Zone heating is recommended to meet the needs of the young pig. Pig behavioral thermoregulation will help the stockperson determine if the temperature is too high or too low. Crowding, with pigs lying on top of each other, indi- cates that pigs are cold. The thermoneutral tempera- ture needs to be determined at the height of the pig, not at the height of the human. In addition to having supplemental heat, nursery fa- cilities should be maintained at a higher degree of sani- tation than is required for older pigs and operated on an all-in, all-out basis. The facility should be cleaned, disinfected, and dried thoroughly between groups of pigs. Room air should be warmed to the proper envi- ronmental temperature before pigs are brought into the building. Weaned pigs should be fed a nutritionally complete and balanced diet unless the experimental protocol dic- tates otherwise (NRC, 2012). Feeding space should be provided that allows all pigs to eat to their appetite over a 24-h period. Pigs may share a feeder space if feed intake is not limited. Wet/dry feeders that supply water as a part of the feeder may support more pigs per feeder space. Pigs should be provided ad libitum access to clean water every day in such a way that all pigs can obtain sufficient water throughout the day. At least one watering device (bowl type cups, nipple drinkers, floor pan drinkers with vacuum type valves) should be pro- vided for every 10 to 20 pigs. The height of the waterer should be set so that pigs can readily drink from the watering device, which means it should be raised as the pigs grow. Care should be taken to maintain a clean wa- ter system. Loose-type feed pans to hold water or feed are not acceptable on a long-term basis because they are too easily turned over or contaminated with urine or fecal material. Hence, nursery or weaned pigs should have an appropriate feeder and waterer in their pens. When possible, pigs should be allocated to pens based on BW and age to facilitate effective feeding and water management (Patience et al., 2004). Because nutrient needs are influenced by genetics and sex, barrows and gilts have different nutrient needs at the same age and are often penned separately. Pigs grow rapidly, which influences space requirements of individually housed and group-housed pigs. The bodies of pigs require a cer- tain amount of space, called the \"occupied space,\" and the space in the pen that remains is the \"free space.\" The amount of space a pig occupies depends on posture and behavior. The amount of available unused or free space increases with an increase in group size, but re- search has shown that if all the free space is removed, feed intake and BW gain will be reduced (McGlone and Newby, 1994). Space needs for pigs in outdoor lots should be based on local performance standards, not on fixed numbers. Floor area recommendations are given in Table 9-3. Slatted floors are common in nurseries as well as wean-to-finish buildings. The flooring material may be Table 9-2.

The minimum space needs for growing pigs follows the general formula of area = 0.33 \u00d7 BW0.67, where body weight (BW) is in kilograms and area is in square meters. Pigs given adequate floor space will lie comfortably without needing to raise their head while resting or constrict their body during normal postures. 2Group area allowances for growing pigs range from starting to ending BW in each phase. The needed floor area per pig decreases as group size increases (McGlone and Newby, 1994). The data presented here are for typical group sizes from 5 to 20 pigs per pen. For small group sizes (2 to 4 pigs), the pens should be longer than the body length of the largest pig in the pen. 3A 138-kg finishing pig needs 0.89 m/pig, and a 148-kg pig needs 0.98 m/pig (Johnston et al., 2017). 4Minimum stall size of (length \u00d7 width) 2.1 m (7 ft) \u00d7 56 cm (22 in) is recommended. Young adult females may be housed in stalls 2 m (6.5 ft) long. As noted in the text, this differs from sows in groups where the minimum floor space allowance should be 1.49 m2 (16 ft2) per sow on partly slatted floors (Salak-Johnson et al., 2007). For large sows (based on BW), floor space allowance should be 1.77 m2 (19 ft2) per sow.132 CHAPTER 9: SWINE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020similar to that in farrowing crate units. Pens with solid floors should be bedded with straw or a material with similar thermal and absorbent properties. If partly slat- ted floors are used, the waterer should be located over the slotted area for optimal drainage. GROWING AND FINISHING SYSTEMS The growing-finishing stage refers to pigs from about 8 or 9 wk of age to market age of about 20 to 25 wk and finished BW between 114 and 136 kg (250 to 300 lb). The management of growing and finishing pigs dif- fers from that of weanling pigs in that a lower standard of sanitation is acceptable, units may be run with a continuous flow of pigs, and older pigs can tolerate a much wider range of environmental temperature than younger pigs (Table 9-1). Although growing-finishing systems may use a continuous flow of pigs, an all-in, all-out system is recommended. Restricting the number of times pigs are moved or mixed is desirable because mixing pigs causes them distress and generally results in aggression, accompanied by the potential for injury, health problems, and reduced performance. Typically, growing-finishing pens are rectangular and contain 20 to 1,000 pigs per pen (or more). Ani- mals need to have free access to feed and water, and stocking rate will determine the minimum number and type of access points that are needed. In gen- eral, the same feeder space can be shared by up to 10 pigs throughout the day, and up to 20 pigs may share the same waterer during the grow-finish phase. In most circumstances, pigs should have ad libitum access to water. However, other acceptable systems provide water during fixed intervals throughout the day, and some systems provide water only when feed is delivered (wet/dry feeders). When water is avail- able in intervals, it should remain on for at least 30 to 45 min at one time (McGlone, 2003). Water should always be available when pigs are eating. The height of the waterer should be adjusted appropriately as pigs grow. Specialized feeding and watering equipment may accommodate different pig densities. Differences in growth potential and nutrient requirements are ap- parent in the grow/finish stage due to genetics, pro- duction goals (e.g., weight gain), environment, and sex, and will influence dietary content. Penning materials should be sturdier than those used in nurseries. Flooring can be solid, solid and bedded, partly slatted, or totally slatted. Solid floors should be sloped (e.g., 1 to 3%) to allow water and manure to flow to a drain or a pit. Slatted floors need not be sloped. Although many flooring materials are accept- able, concrete slats are recommended for slatted floors. Concrete slats should allow support of the pig's feet and the manure to fall between the slots. Edges of the slats should be rounded to preclude foot-claw injuries; sharp edges should be avoided. Open flush gutter sys- tems are acceptable, but the risk of contamination be- tween pens is significant.Ventilation is essential to limit moisture accumula- tion in the winter and heat in the summer. Hence, it uses the flow of air, to influence the environment and ultimately comfort. Included in this system are the fans, inlets, heaters, and controllers. Floor-space allowance is a complex issue in swine production. Floor area recommendations are given in Table 9-3. Traditional space requirements were estab- lished with relatively small group sizes; hence, in large group sizes, there is a greater amount of shared, un- used, or free space. Research suggests that 0.65 m2 (6 ft2)/pig is adequate for maintenance of economical pig growth (Brumm and Dahlquist, 1997). Pigs up to 115 kg (250 lb) of BW and in small group sizes (<20) re- quire 0.56 to 0.74 m2/pig (8.0 ft2/pig). In larger groups, those up to 136 kg (300 lb) and with over 50 pigs/pen may need only 0.74 m2/pig (8.0 to 9.0 ft2/pig), the same amount of space as the smaller pigs. Replacement gilts separated from market animals may need additional floor space to reduce the opportunity for injury. Floor space allowance may be determined using the following equation: A = k \u00d7 BW0.667, where A = floor space al- lowance, and k = a space allowance coefficient that con- verts pig BW into a 2-dimensional concept (Gonyou et al., 2006). A k value of 0.0336 was the minimum space allowance for grow-finishing pigs on fully slatted floors. Space needs for pigs in outdoor lots should be based on performance standards. Less space is required in out- door lots in cold weather than in hot and wet weather. In outdoor finishing, several alternative non-environ- mentally controlled systems are acceptable for grow- finish pigs. A common alternative system is a naturally ventilated, open-air hoop building; these buildings are usually bedded in cold temperatures. Another alterna- tive is indoor-outdoor lots. The floors in these types of structures, which vary in size, may be earthen or concrete. If the floor is concrete, it should be sloped to the outside. Bedding is often used in the sheltered areas of these open-front buildings but not in the run areas, especially during cold weather. BREEDING AND GESTATION SYSTEMS Sows, if managed properly, may be housed individual- ly or in groups during breeding and gestation (McGlone et al., 2004b; AVMA, 2005). Both field and controlled studies (McGlone et al., 1994, 2004b; McGlone, 1995; AVMA, 2005) support the idea that the individual crate or stall and well-managed sows in group housing promote high reproductive success and do not induce a distress response, based on endocrine and immune data. A properly designed individual stall or group sys- tem is an acceptable production system for teaching and research units. All housing systems have advantag- es and disadvantages (McGlone et al., 2004b; AVMA, 2005). Several gestation housing systems may be rea- sonable choices, including individual crates or group pens with outdoor, individual feeders, electronic feed- ers, floor feeding, or trickle feeding. The tether system 133 CHAPTER 9: SWINE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020is not widely used in the United States and has been banned in European Community member countries since 1997; tether systems should not be used. Some individual states in the United States and Canada have banned or will phase out the use of gestation stalls for sows except immediately after breeding. Teaching and research activities in states where gestation crates have been banned must comply with state regulations unless exempt. According to American Veterinary Medicine Association policy (AVMA, 2005), all sow housing sys- tems should attempt to minimize sow aggression and competition, especially at mixing and during feeding; provide sow protection from environmental extremes and hazards; provide feed and water; and allow sows to express normal behaviors. Moreover, if sows are to be housed in small groups, they are best managed as a static group, whereas if they are to be housed in large groups, management as a dynamic group is feasible. If possible, sows should be moved to new pens when new animals are introduced or mixed into the group. If no individual feeding system is provided, animals should be sorted and grouped based on established eating be- havior. Sows in group pens (e.g., 5 to 10 per pen) and on restricted feed rations should be uniform in size and temperament. In extensive production systems, larger group sizes can be managed because feeding space per sow can be increased to reduce competition for feed. Electronic feeding systems can be used to successfully provide the needed feed quantity and reduce competi- tion in group-housed sows. Building Environment for Breeding and Gestation The suggested optimum range of air temperatures of the housing environment for gestating gilts and sows [data from sows >100 kg (220 lb), Table 9-1] is 10 to 25\u00b0C (50 to 77\u00b0F). Nevertheless, it is important to re- member that the effective temperature experienced by the gestating animal is a function of air temperature, relative humidity, air speed, wall and ceiling tempera- ture, floor characteristics, BW, feed intake, huddling, and number of animals housed together. The animal's behavior should be observed as an indicator of thermal comfort. Individual Stall Management Variation in physical size of sows exists not only with- in groups of sows at one location but also among farms (McGlone et al., 2004a). Data from a large sample of sows indicate that the size of the traditional gestation crate would have to be increased to accommodate the average sow (McGlone et al., 2004a), and it has been shown that a small increase in stall dimensions can re- duce injuries and improve well-being of sows consider- ably (Anil et al., 2002). Sows should be in a pen or stall that allows them to lie down without being forced to have parts of their body extending into the neighboring stall. Standing sows and gilts should not be forcibly in contact with the sides, ends, or top of the stall (Cur- tis et al., 1989), and sows housed in individual stalls should be able to lie down in full recumbency without their heads lying upon a raised feeding trough. This performance standard is consistent with standards of the National Pork Board (2002). Group Housing Management In the case of group housing systems, much of the ag- gression and competition associated with group housing is influenced by feeding method, social status, and floor space per animal, group size, genetics, and manage- ment procedures. Thus, some of the many factors that should be considered when designing and implementing group-housing systems are group size, floor space allow- ance, group composition (static vs. dynamic), diet type and method of feed delivery, genetics, and sow tem- perament (Levis, 2007). Group housing for sows may be indoors or outdoors, dry lot or pasture, and use an insulated, mechanically ventilated frame structure or a hoop structure. Floor types may be solid or slatted, with or without bedding. Sow groups must be managed to reduce social stress that can result in severe injury, especially when initially mixed. The social interaction among females in the pen is influenced by the number of females per pen, the area of space per female, variation in body size among fe- males, duration of time together, and, most importantly, method of feeding. When the group is fed a limited dai- ly ration, competition for feed can be intense; without intervention from animal care personnel or a physical system, dominant sows overeat and subordinates ingest inadequate amounts of feed. Several feeding systems and management schemes can be used to minimize the ag- gressiveness of sows during feeding. Group housing sys- tems include but are not limited to drop feeding, trickle feeding, stall feeding, and electronic sow feeding systems. In addition, there are 2 basic management schemes for group management\u2014static or dynamic. When sows are kept in small groups or groups up to 35 or 40 sows, maintenance as a static group with sows in the same production phase can decrease aggression. In contrast, groups of 80 to 200 sows exhibit minimal aggression when maintained as a dynamic group where sows en- ter and leave the group every week. Minimizing social stress by keeping sows in individual stalls for the first 25 to 35 d after breeding or grouping all sows at one time helps to decrease fetal loss. Knox et al. (2014) found that productivity is maximized when sows are not mixed; however, when mixing did occur, mixing at d 3 created the poorest welfare and productivity com- pared with mixing at d 13 or 35 of gestation. Specific genetic strains of sows may differ in their ability to adapt to particular housing environments (Beilharz, 1982), but this hypothesis has not been fully 134 CHAPTER 9: SWINE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020investigated with modern and ever-changing genetics. Inputs from managers, proper habituation, and selec- tion of appropriate genetic stock appear to be the pri- mary contributors to the well-being of sows, indepen- dent of the gestation systems used. Floor Space Allowance and Group Size Floor space allowance will vary with group size. Space for accessing necessary resources and opportunity to avoid or escape from potential aggressors are essential for the well-being of low-ranking sows in group housing. Space should be adequate to avoid physical injury. The minimum floor space allowance should be 1.49 m2 (16 ft2) per sow on partly slatted floors (Salak-Johnson et al., 2007). For large sows (based on BW), floor space allowance should be 1.77 m2 (19 ft2) per sow; thus, as BW increases, floor space allowance increases slightly. No optimal group size has been determined. Farrowing rate and litter size were not different when 10 sows per pen were housed at 1.95 m2 (13 ft2) per sow compared with housing 5, 10, 20, or 40 sows per pen at 1.49 m2 (21 ft2) per sow (Taylor et al., 1997). Mating Facilities Recommended areas for breeding sows and boars of different types and sizes are listed in Table 9-3. Sexu- al development of gilts selected to enter the breeding herd is hastened when they are kept in groups (10 to 12 per pen recommended in intensive production sys- tems) with the opportunity for direct contact with ma- ture boars for at least 30 min/d. Individual housing of mature boars is recommended to preclude fighting. In systems in which boars reside in small groups, boars should be of comparable size, and it is highly desirable that they be reared together from the time of puber- ty. Stalls for boars should meet the same performance standards as for sows. Hence, larger stalls or pens may be required for extremely large boars. Specialized facilities or areas are needed for breeding. Breeding may be by natural service or artificial insemi- nation. Boar breeding areas should be slip-resistant. If semen is not purchased and shipped to the site, artifi- cial insemination areas will need to include boar semen collection and sow insemination areas and be designed to consider boar and worker safety as well as animal comfort and sanitation. Sow insemination areas may be the same as gestation facilities for sows. The floor- ing of pens with an area of solid concrete may be made slip-resistant by applying a wood float or broom finish or by placing grooves in the concrete. A 2.5-cm (1- in) diamond pattern has proved satisfactory (Levis et al., 1985). In pens that lack good footing and are used for hand mating, absorbent substances or rubber mats may be placed on the floor. Natural service mating options are pen mating, where the boar is placed with sows unattended, and hand mating, with personnel attending the mating. With pen mating in pasture and drylot systems, primary con- siderations are to minimize extremes in environmental temperature, rest boars between mating sessions, and avoid putting young boars with old sows or old boars with gilts. Sows kept for several parities may require special at- tention. Animal caretakers should be aware of the pos- sibility of shoulder sores, long hoof growth, and thin body condition. Selection of animals with good confor- mation provides the opportunity for animals to wear off their toes on rough surfaces such as concrete. Metabolism Stalls Metabolism stalls are used to pen individual pigs for certain nutrition and physiology investigations with the approval of the institutional animal care and use com- mittee. Feed is usually provided in meals and not ad li- bitum to meet the objectives of the research. Research- ers are able to calculate the amount to be fed based on objectives of the research and known consumption data for the size and age of the animals involved in the project. The metabolism stall usually (but not always) keeps pigs in a manner that precludes them from turn- ing around and defecating or urinating in their feed. If the flooring and penning materials are appropriate for the size of the pig to be used, and if the space al- lowances for individual pigs are met (Table 9-2), then pigs may be penned for extended periods in metabo- lism stalls without problems. The precise width of a metabolism stall may require adjustments to provide total urine and fecal collection while preventing the pigs from turning or flipping. Slightly smaller space al- lowances may therefore be needed to accomplish these objectives. In studies requiring the use of metabolism stalls, animal care staff must check on the pigs at least twice a day. Visual and vocal interactions with other pigs also support the well-being of individually housed pigs. Pigs should be held in metabolism stalls no longer than required by the approved animal care protocol. STANDARD AGRICUL TURAL PRACTICES Castration Boar taint, defined as a specific objectionable odor and flavor in meat, often occurs when boars are slaugh- tered at a BW of approximately 100 kg (220 lb) or more. In view of the demand by US packers for heavier market hogs, almost all male pigs in the United States are castrated a few days after birth and hence are bar- rows at slaughter. If teaching and research pigs are to be marketed in commercial chains, castration is rec- ommended. If the research intends to reflect commer- cial pork production, castrated males are appropriate model animals. Castration causes obvious signs of pain and discomfort for pigs (McGlone and Hellman, 1988; 135 CHAPTER 9: SWINE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020McGlone et al., 1993; White et al., 1995; Taylor and Weary, 2000; Hay et al., 2003; Prunier et al., 2005; Carroll et al., 2006). Signs of pain and discomfort may include reduced nursing or feeding time, increased vo - calization (apart from that induced by handling), in- flammation and swelling at the castration site, and hormonal responses. It is important to note that al- though all researchers reported some evidence of pain and discomfort in pigs, results have not been consistent across experiments. To minimize stress on the pig, cas- tration should be performed early, preferably between 1 and 14 d of age. Pigs should be checked for cryptor- chidism or evidence of scrotal hernia before being cas- trated. Cryptorchids may require a second castration event to remove the remaining testis once it descends (hence, there is little value in castrating when only one testis is present in the scrotum) and a scrotal hernia can complicate the pig's recovery process. Pigs with evidence of scrotal hernia can be castrated, but the technician needs to be prepared to treat the situation to optimize the pig's likelihood of recovery. After 14 d of age, local anesthetic or a combination of local and general anesthetic (Haga and Ranheim, 2005) should be administered before castration under prescription from the attending veterinarian. For boars of any age, trained personnel should use disinfected instruments, and a precastration disinfectant should be applied to the incision site. To allow proper drainage, the inci- sion should be in the ventral scrotum and should not be sutured. Topical anesthetic may be used for short- term pain alleviation. Although a great deal of research into methods for pain mitigation has been conducted, no painless alternatives have emerged. Growing intact animals or use of immuno-castration have potential but also provide significant limitations (see Rault et al., 2011 for review). Nose Rings Outdoor swine production systems may have unde- sirable environmental consequences due to pig rooting behavior. Nose rings reduce rooting behavior by mak- ing it a painful experience (Horrell et al., 2001; Eriksen et al., 2006); however, pigs only experience pain when fitted with nose rings. This presents an issue of envi- ronment versus welfare (McGlone, 2001). Nose rings should not be used as they have been shown to affect eating behavior (Horrell et al., 2000), and pigs will en- gage in other exploratory behaviors if they cannot root (Studnitz et al., 2003). Other Standard Practices Several other standard agricultural practices that cause pain or distress but prevent more serious distress or injury later in the pig's life may also be performed. As noted earlier, needle teeth of pigs may be clipped at 1 to 3 d of age to reduce damage to littermates and to the sow. However, if a smooth surface does not result, clipping needle teeth may not be a good prac- tice (Michigan State University Extension, 2019). No more than one-half of the tooth should be trimmed. Ears may be notched to provide permanent individual identification. Tails may be docked to reduce the poten- tial for tail biting; this is an important and acceptable practice used in commercial production. Alternatives exist for each procedure performed; thus, Marchant- Forde et al. (2009) compared each method with an alternative: teeth grinding versus clipping; cut castra- tion versus tear castration; cold tail docking versus hot tail docking; ear notching versus ear tagging; and iron injection versus oral iron. In general, tasks that took longer were more stressful. However, they also found that grinding teeth was more stressful than clipping. They created the \"best\" and \"worst\" combinations of procedures (Marchant-Forde et al., 2014); again, the longer the tasks took to perform, the more distressing the procedures were. Painful processing procedures are thought to have only acute effects. However, Zhou et al. (2013) found that pigs that were tail docked and had their teeth clipped had decreased exploratory be- havior through the grower phase and a reduced average daily gain and BW up to 70 d of age compared with undocked, unclipped pigs. This difference disappeared by 160 d of age. Tail docking at a young age is used to reduce or prevent tail biting, which affects the health of the pig that is abused. Tusks of boars may be cut at the gum line to prevent them from harming humans or other pigs. Several methods of cutting the tusk of boars exist, including using bolt cutters, embryotomy wire, or a hack saw. To date, no comparison of the methods relative to pain have been conducted. If excessive hoof growth occurs because of the pig's poor structure and lack of rough walking surface such as cement, sows and boars may need to have their hooves trimmed to allow them to walk with greater ease and to avoid injuries. Because some procedures are known to be painful, a great deal of research has been performed recently to test the efficacy and practicality of several anesthet- ics and analgesics. O'Connor et al. (2014) performed a meta-analysis of the current literature on pain man- agement for neonatal pigs. They concluded that lim- ited evidence exists to make strong recommendations; however, they did recommend strongly against carbon dioxide/oxygen anesthesia, weakly for the use of non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and weakly against lidocaine for castration. ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT Refer to Chapter 4: Environmental Enrichment for information on enrichment of swine environments.136 CHAPTER 9: SWINE Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020HANDLING AND TRANSPORT Refer to Chapter 5: Animal Handling and Trans- port for information on handling and transportation of swine. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS Pigs with Small Mature Body Size Some breeds of Sus scrofa or Sus vittatus have, natu- rally or through selection, a small mature body size. These include but are not limited to mini, micro, and potbellied pigs. These pigs are seldom used in commer- cial agricultural production but are more often kept as pets or used as biomedical research models. However, the husbandry requirements of these pigs are generally similar to those of traditional domestic pigs, with some exceptions. Thermal and nutrient requirements should be care- fully considered. Pigs with small mature body size are more sensitive to cool temperatures than are larger pigs because of their sparse hair coat and small body size. Because they are smaller and eat less per day, their nutrient requirements per weight of feed may be higher, although they must be limit-fed to control body condi- tion (avert obesity). The physical environment (e.g., flooring and penning materials) should be appropriate for their body size. Genetically Engineered and Cloned Pigs Refer to Chapter 1: Institutional Policies for informa- tion on transgenesis, gene editing, and cloning as they relate to animal care and use. Information on the ad- ditional regulatory oversight of transgenic animals and those researchers or institutions working with transgen- ic animals is available in Guidance for Industry: Regula- tion of Intentionally Altered Genomic DNA in Animals (FDA, 2018).

This document is available online (http://www.aasv.org/aasv/docu- ments/SwineEuthanasia.pdf ) and describes 6 accept- able methods of euthanasia and clearly notes which methods are most appropriate. Human safety risks as- sociated with administering each method of euthanasia are addressed. All methods should only be performed by trained individuals. Blunt force trauma is accept- able for pigs weighing <5.5 kg. Carbon dioxide is a suitable method for euthanizing pigs less than 10 wk of age and less than 14 kg (30 lb), providing that residual O2 is removed quickly from the CO 2 chamber. Carbon monoxide is not recommended because it is a potential human health hazard. Electrocution is acceptable for pigs over 4.5 kg (10 lb). An overdose of anesthetic or in- jection with a euthanasia solution is suitable for pigs of all ages; both are humane methods that may be prac- ticed after careful training. Barbiturates require spe- cial handling and licensing. Gunshot and captive bolt with exsanguination are appropriate for pigs weighing >5.5 kg. These recommendations are in line with the AVMA guide to follow. Incurably ill or severely injured animals in pain or distress must be humanely eutha- nized as soon as possible after they are diagnosed, ac- cording to approved described methods. In the United States, all procedures used to slaugh- ter research and teaching animals that will enter the food chain must comply with US Code of Federal Reg- ulations, Title 7, Chapter 48, Humane Slaughter of Livestock (https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/US- CODE-2011-title7/pdf/USCODE-2011-title7-chap48. pdf). The North American Meat Institute (NAMI) has embraced guidelines (https://animalhandling.org/pro- ducers/guidelines_audits) that exceed the regulatory requirements (Grandin, 2017) and the NAMI guide- lines (NAMI, 2019) are incorporated here by reference.

There is a common perception that needs of sheep and goats are similar. However, differences in behavior, foraging, diet, uses, and various physiological characteristics mean that general care, management, and facilities may need to be tailored to each species. People who care for these animals should be appropri- ately trained, understand the species requirements, and have good observational and communications skills to ensure that the animals are cared for in a manner that is consistent with their wellbeing. In many countries, and jurisdictions within countries, various laws and regulations govern animal manage- ment practices. Local institutional animal care and use committees (IACUC) and people using sheep and goats in research and teaching should be familiar with laws and regulations that govern animal management prac- tices, and they should be certain that animals are cared for as specified in IACUC protocols. FACILITIES AND ENVIRONMENT Sheep and goats used in research and teaching may be produced and managed under a variety of envi- ronmental conditions, including completely or par- tially enclosed buildings, drylots, pastures, and remote rangelands. Regardless of the setting, the management system should be appropriate for the research or teach- ing objectives and should ensure that the animals are cared for properly. Because of their adaptability and the insulating value of wool and hair, artificial shelter for sheep and goats may not always be necessary. Goats are more toler- ant to heat stress than sheep, and both are superior to cows in this respect, due to the morphological and physiological differences between these species related to heat dissipation (Bernabucci et al., 2010). Observa- tion of increased respiratory rate can provide a reli- able and practical indication of heat stress (Silanikove, 2000). However, goats are more sensitive to precipita- tion, cold, and inclement weather than sheep, and they modify their behavior by seeking shelter (B\u00f8e and Eh-rlenbruch, 2013). Shivering with an arched posture is indicative of cold stress in goats (Battini et al., 2016). Sheep will try to maintain their body temperature by reducing their rate of respiration, shivering, seeking shelter, and huddling together. During extreme weather conditions, it may be necessary to mitigate hypo- or hyperthermia. Site-specific needs for artificial shelter should consider the geography, local environment and climate, recency of shearing, and anticipated extremes of temperature. For shelter from wind, cold, or sun, sheep and goats typically seek shelter near terrain and structures, such as trees, shrubs, swales, boulders, ridg- es, and artificial windbreaks. Wind-chill effects can be predicted for small ruminants (Ames and Insley, 1975). Provision of additional feed and protection from wind and precipitation should be provided if the ani- mals may experience hypothermia. Relationships be- tween environmental conditions and nutrition have been described (NRC, 1981). Within intensive produc- tion facilities, ventilation and structural design should minimize moisture condensation during cold weather, provide cooling during hot weather, and ensure that air quality standards are met. Newborn lambs (Pollard, 2006; Dwyer et al., 2016) and kids (Dwyer et al., 2016) are susceptible to hy- pothermia, as well as hyperthermia and sunburn. At birth, ambient temperature can drop from 39\u00b0C in ute- ro to 10\u00b0C or lower and maintaining body temperature depends on balancing heat loss and heat production. Frequency of neonatal observations should be increased to ensure adequate bonding between dam and offspring, and appropriate shelter should be provided if natural conditions do not offer sufficient protection from the weather. When barns or sheds are provided, adequate ven- tilation and clean, dry surroundings are necessary to maintain air quality, minimize the incidence of disease, and promote animal health and wellbeing. Poor ventila- tion reduces production by dairy sheep, and recommen- dations for adequate ventilation have been published (Sevi et al., 2002, 2003a,b, 2006; Albenzio et al., 2005). No difference in reproductive performance or mortality of liveborn lambs was found between warm and cold housing (Simensen et al., 2014). Guidelines for facil- ity layout and housing can be found in Management CHAPTER 10: DOMESTIC SHEEP AND GOATS 141and Diseases of Dairy Goats (Guss, 1977), Goat Produc- tion (Gall, 1981), Goat Farming (Mowlen, 1992), Goat Management (Mackenzie, 1993), Sheep Housing and Equipment Handbook (MWPS, 1994), Sheep Production Handbook (ASIA, 2015), Small Ruminant Production Medicine and Management: Sheep and Goats (Faerber, 2004), and Hoop Barns for Horses, Sheep, Ratites, and Multiple Utilization (Harmon et al., 2004). Caroprese (2008) discusses sheep housing and welfare. In confinement, the space required per animal de- pends on the intent of the research and teaching, type and slope of floor or ground surface, and weather con- ditions. Acceptable floor surfaces include well-drained compacted soil, nonskid concrete, concrete-slatted floors, composition mats, wood, and expanded metal or woven metal flooring or other materials that allow for proper footing and comfort. Requirements vary consid- erably among locations and type of management. Es- timated minimum area recommendations for confined sheep taken from the Sheep Housing and Equipment Handbook (MWPS, 1994) are reiterated in Table 10-1. Stocking density is a factor to be considered in dairy sheep housing, and a space allocation <2 m2/animal may adversely affect performance and health of the lac- tating ewe (Sevi et al., 1999). Because goats naturally gravitate toward hard sur- faces, managing their housing to include different op- tions can improve both cleaning and animal welfare (e.g., lying on dry hard surfaces and defecating on soft material; Sutherland et al., 2017). When goats have access to outside lots or pastures, an adequate shel- tered area is 0.5 m2 (5.4 ft2) per goat (Kilgour and Dalton, 1984). Goats in confinement barns require ap- proximately 1.5 m2 (15-16 ft2) per animal if in pens or individual stalls (similar to tie stalls for dairy cattle; see Chapter 7: Dairy Cattle) should be at least 0.56 m2 (6 ft2) and equipped with feeders and water (Kilgour and Dalton, 1984; UMass, 2019), and recent recommenda- tions suggest that 2.5 to 3.0 m2/goat (27 to 32 ft2/goat) may be appropriate (MPI, 2018; UMass, 2019). Access to objects for climbing increases feed consump- tion and reduces aggression among goats (Flint and Murray, 2001). Prolonged exposure to wet surfaces compromises hoof health of sheep and goats. Animals should have adequate access to well-drained, dry surfaces. Crushed stone or stone dust is a suitable surface for heavily traf- ficked areas. However, experience suggests that dusty pens may cause lung damage that is a precursor to pneumonia. Dust control in pens may reduce respirato- ry and other health problems as well as improve fleece quality. The surfaces of floors, pens, pastures, and other en- closures can affect hoof wear and health. Goats are adapted for rocky, mountainous terrains (e.g., Shi et al., 2005) and have fast-growing hooves. Without the opportunity to wear their hooves naturally, goats re- quire frequent hoof trimming. Thus, an effective hoof care program is an important component of sheep and goat management and welfare. Small ruminants may need special attention when respiratory rates increase in response to increased air temperatures. During hot weather, handling or driving of sheep or goats should be restricted to cooler times of the day. Opportunities for acclimatization should be considered when using sheep and goats for research and teaching, particularly when animals are moved between housing environments of disparate temperature (for discussions of environmental, heat, and cold stress, see Ames et al., 1971; Morrison, 1983; Webster, 1983; and Young, 1983). FENCING Fences allow managers to keep their animals together and isolated from other animals. Proper fences and the appropriate use of fences can improve nutrition, health, and biosecurity, ensure the integrity of experimental Table 10-1. Recommendations for minimum floor and feeder space for confined sheep used in research and teaching1,2 Area Floor typeRams 1.5 16 1.5 16 1.9 20 \u2014 \u2014 0.93 10 Feeder space cm in cm in cm in cm in cm in should be increased for fully fleeced or horned sheep and during hot weather. Smaller resource allocations reflect minimum re - quirements for animals at the lower end of the weight range and larger resource allocations reflect minimum requirements for animals at the upper end of the weight range. Linear interpolation may provide reasonable allocations for animals of intermediate sizes. 3Increase space if lambing rate is >170%.142 CHAPTER 10: DOMESTIC SHEEP AND GOATS Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020designs and protocols, and protect the physical security of animals used in research and teaching. Appropriate fencing varies (Miller, 1984) but a few general recom- mendations for fencing should be noted: (1) It is important to understand the behavior of sheep and goats and how they respond to, or cope with, fences. The agility and inquisitive na- ture of goats can make some difficult to contain. Goats and the occasional sheep will defeat tra- ditional gate or pen latching mechanisms. Thus, safeguards or redundant measures for securing entrance and exit points should be considered. Sheep and goats may become entrapped in poor- ly constructed or inappropriate electric fencing. Sheep and goats frequently attempt to eat forage that is beyond the perimeter of the fence. They can trap their heads (especially if horns are pres- ent) or legs in an inappropriate fence. During the breeding season, rams and buck goats often attempt to escape enclosures to reach ewes and does. Rams in adjacent enclosures will attempt to fight, which often destroys the fence between them and allows the rams to escape. (2) Fences should be designed, constructed, and maintained so that they do not endanger the ani- mals being enclosed and should offer the greatest opportunity to accomplish the objectives for the fence at an affordable cost. (3) Fences should keep sheep and goats protected from unwanted animals such as domestic, feral, or wild predators or other wildlife. (4) Fence design should be consistent with institu- tional, local, state, and federal requirements; some of these may be legal requirements, which must be followed. Those requirements vary among states, and they are likely to evolve and may become more stringent (Centner, 2000). (5) A fence should be constructed according to the appropriate design. It should be maintained properly, remain effective, and not endanger the animals being enclosed. (6) Fencing is not always required (e.g., for sheep research on open rangelands), and federal rules in some locations prevent the construction of fences. Under these conditions, trained herders can stay with the sheep to protect the sheep and direct their grazing patterns. Sheep herding dogs and guardian animals such as special breeds of dogs (e.g., Akbash, Komondor, and Great Pyr- enees), donkeys, and llamas may be used for the management and protection of sheep on open rangeland or wherever there is a need for guard- ian animals (Cavalcanti and Knowlton, 1998; Andelt and Hopper, 2000; Meadows and Knowl- ton, 2000). Due to their continuous motivation to herd, herding dogs should be used for man- agement requirements only, and must not be left with sheep and goats as can be allowed with guardian animals. LIGHTING Sheep or goats confined in a barn should experi- ence diurnal cycles of light and dark, unless research protocols require alternative lighting regimens. Photo- period and light intensity should be adequate for in- spection, maintenance of activity patterns, and physi- ological control of reproductive functions in breeding animals (Ortavant, 1977). General illumination of 220 lx is recommended (MWPS, 1994). This recommenda- tion may be met with daylight through windows, which may also provide ventilation in warm weather (Colby, 1972). Supplemental light of 170 lx is recommended during hours of darkness for ease of observation during lambing or kidding. In outdoor pens, lighting may deter predators, but it can interrupt reproductive cycles or alter feeding behaviors. Either natural or artificial light may be used to control reproductive cycles of sheep and goats. Unless the experimental protocol or management system has special light or photoperiod requirements, illumination in all animal rooms should mimic a nor- mal diurnal pattern of intensity and duration. Specified altered diurnal lighting may at times be implemented for certain reproduction research or for accelerated re- productive management systems that include autumn lambing and kidding because sheep and goats are sensi- tive to, and can be manipulated with, changing photo- period cycles. FEED AND WATER Feed Sheep and goats should be fed according to estab- lished nutrient requirements to provide for proper growth of young animals and long-term maintenance of body weight (BW), body condition, which can be assessed as body condition score (BCS; Thompson and Meyer, 1994), and reproduction of adults (NRC, 2007). Body weight and condition of sheep and goats may vary considerably during different parts of the graz- ing and reproductive cycles (Engle, 1994; Taylor et al., 2009). Feeding programs should make it possible for animals to regain BW after the normal periods of BW loss. However, excessive feeding beyond what is needed to achieve defined production goals can result in nutri- ent wasting and metabolic disorders. Nutrient recom- mendations for sheep and goats and factors (feedstuffs, environmental, physiological, behavioral, and diseases) affecting nutrient requirements and availability are ad- dressed in Nutrient Requirements of Small Ruminants: Sheep, Goats, Cervids, and New World Camelids (NRC, 2007). Comprehensive descriptions and solutions for as- sessing and managing feed and metabolic-related dis-143 CHAPTER 10: DOMESTIC SHEEP AND GOATS Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020eases in sheep are discussed in the Sheep Production Handbook (ASIA, 2015). A variety of feed ingredients may be fed to sheep and goats, but changes in the relative amounts of forages and concentrates in diets should be made gradually. Animals should be managed during transition periods or sufficient potentially fermentable fiber should be fed to avoid the development of digestive disorders such as acidosis. Male sheep and goats consuming diets with moderate to large amounts of concentrate are prone to urinary calculi. Occurrences of this condition can be prevented or minimized by maintaining a dietary Ca:P ratio of at least 2:1, including urine-acidifying agents such as ammonium chloride in the diet, and increasing dietary salt content to promote water intake. When feeding nontraditional feedstuffs, their compositions should be determined, and potential nutrient toxicities or deficiencies should be corrected. Feeding equipment should be constructed and locat- ed to be available for ready access, provide sufficient feeder space, prevent injury to animals, and minimize contamination of feed with excreta. Providing sufficient feeder space so that all animals have access to feed (see Table 10-1) is important for sheep and goats when feed- ing limited amounts of feedstuffs that are consumed quickly (supplements and concentrates). An alternative is to offer a diet with adequate potentially fermentable neutral detergent fiber in a self-feeder at which groups of animals take turns eating. A minimum dietary con- centration of potentially fermentable neutral detergent fiber provides substrates for normal ruminal Thonney, 2017). Sheep and goats in some production settings undergo periods of nutrient deficiencies or intake limitations that result in considerable BW loss. Hence, research to address such scenarios may necessitate simulation of such conditions. Researchers should be aware that, even though restricted nutritional planes can decrease BW and BCS, adaptive decreases in the maintenance energy requirement can minimize the negative effects of such changes. Unlike cattle, where visual assessment can be used to accurately determine BCS, manual palpation of the sternum and spinous process is nec- essary in sheep and goats (Gaden, 2005). In research dealing with limited nutritional planes, individual BW and BCS of sheep and goats should be monitored fre- quently so that excessive decreases are avoided. Thus, if a study has a target BCS of 2 on a scale of 1 to 5, some animals will have lower BCS, perhaps 1.5, which may be undesirable for an extended period. Animals on limited planes of nutrition with low BCS can be more susceptible to disease under adverse environmental conditions. Thus, they are less competitive for limited feeder and shelter space compared with animals in bet- ter condition. Animals reaching very low BCS (<1.5 on a 5-point scale) should be placed on a higher plane of nutrition to regain BW and increase their BCS unless this is part of an approved protocol.Both sheep and goats consume a variety of plants (grass, legumes, forbs, and shrubs) when foraging on pasture or range. Unlike sheep, which are primarily grazers, goats are naturally browsers and will seek out small woody plants and brush. Their browsing behavior extends to not just what they eat, but how they eat it; when given the option, goats will adopt a variety of stances, including foraging elevated (above their head) and bipedal (Sanon et al., 2007; T\u00f6l\u00fc et al., 2012). It has been suggested this type of foraging behavior helps decrease parasite load (Hoste et al., 2001). Goats will eat more from elevated feeders (Neave et al., 2018), and offering feed at different levels decreases aggression (Aschwanden et al., 2009). Pasture and range forages for sheep and goats can vary from season to season and among geographic lo- cations. Nutritional management of pastured animals is mainly controlled by movement of sheep and goats to pastures of varying forage density and by supplying appropriate minerals and water. Sheep and goats differ somewhat in susceptibility to adverse effects or toler- ance of some plant secondary metabolites, and physi- ological conditions in animals can change over time and confer some degree of adaptation. When risks of plant secondary metabolite exposure are expected from pas- ture or a fed diet, animals should be monitored closely. Sheep and goats are sometimes used as biologi- cal control agents for managing invasive plant species (Lym et al., 1997; Arviv et al., 2016). In such cases, animals may graze plant communities with limited plant diversity, be required to remove the majority of standing biomass, or graze plants that are potentially toxic or have large amounts of antiproductive second- ary metabolites. Because sheep and goats differ in their susceptibility to plant secondary metabolites, grazing animals should be monitored regularly once grazing commences to ensure adequate forage availability and to identify potential or manifested nutrient deficiencies and plant-related toxicities. Animals showing marked signs of nutrient deficiencies or toxicosis should be re- moved and treated accordingly. Water Sheep and goats must have access to an adequate supply of potable water to avoid dehydration, unless dehydration is a component of an approved research protocol. Their water requirements increase during hot and humid weather, and water availability may need to be adjusted. Freezing of the water supply should be addressed in cold environments. Outdoors, even though an adequate supply of liquid water is preferred, non- lactating sheep may consume enough soft snow, as op- posed to hard crusty snow, to meet their water require- ments (Degen and Young, 1981). Established equations can be used to estimate water requirements under a variety of conditions (NRC, 2007). Water requirements of sheep and goats are based on, but not limited to, physiological state, dry mat-144 CHAPTER 10: DOMESTIC SHEEP AND GOATS Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020ter intake, climatic conditions, and environment (Ma- rai et al., 2007). A comprehensive discussion of water requirements is beyond the scope of this chapter, but NRC (2007) contains thorough descriptions of water use, sources, quality, and requirements for sheep and goats. Careful consideration of water source, location, and quality will enable caretakers to effectively as- sess and meet the water needs of sheep and goats in research and teaching settings. When sheep or goats are closely confined, water buckets or troughs can eas- ily become contaminated with feces, bedding, or feed. These sources of water should be checked daily and cleaned if necessary. Sheep and goats satisfy their water requirements from drinking water, food (preformed water such as that found in lush forages), and metabolic processes (meta- bolic water; NRC, 2007). In some research and teaching settings, sheep and goats consume water from sources such as ponds, streams, and springs. Even though it is common and recommended (NRC, 2007) for liquid water to be available continually to sheep and goats, this is not practiced in some production and research settings. Sheep on range or pasture may satisfy their water requirement from fresh forages as preformed wa- ter (Lynch et al., 1972) or snow. However, this has not been validated with breeds and genotypes that have not been adapted to arid environments, breeds that have high genetic potentials for performance, or non- native forage varieties. When cold drinking water is consumed in large vol- umes, the temperature of the rumen may decrease, which reduces the activity of ruminal microorganisms (NRC, 2007). However, when water is available in the form of snow, sheep consume it in small amounts along with the forage. Therefore, the cooling effect on rumen temperature may be less because of the temperature- buffering capacity of water already present in the retic- ulum-rumen (NRC, 2007). Under some circumstances, water availability need not be continuous. For example, research animals in a head-box respiration calorimetry system may be offered water at discrete times, perhaps twice daily, to prevent accumulation of excessive moisture in the calorimeter and thus compromise the integrity of the research. Depending on source, drinking water can contain a variety of contaminants such as excessive sulfates and salts that are harmful or impair sheep and goat pro- ductivity. The National Research Council publications for dairy cattle (NRC, 2001) and beef cattle (Nation- al Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2016) are excellent sources of information on water con- taminants that reduce livestock production. Historical records of water quality can be investigated, or appro- priate analyses should be conducted on drinking water sources. Water contaminants, although not necessarily harmful to sheep, may interfere with results of experi- ments, such as in mineral balance studies.Manufactured watering receptacles should be in- spected and cleaned regularly to ensure that adequate supplies of good-quality water are available as appro- priate with the setting. Watering receptacles should be designed and positioned to minimize feed and fe- cal contamination, be free of electrical and mechanical hazards that are harmful to animals and personnel, be protected from freezing, and accommodate the needs and behaviors of sheep and goats. Improperly installed or defective electrically heated livestock waterers may allow stray voltage to flow through the water and metal in the waterer and deter animals from consuming ad- equate amounts of water. Several publications describe how to test for and prevent or eliminate stray volt- age and the effects of stray voltage on livestock (for reviews, see USDA, 1991; Fick and Surbrook, 2007). Waterers should be located in areas that facilitate re- search and (or) teaching goals and do not compromise the surrounding environment. MANAGEMENT People using sheep and goats for research and teach- ing should be trained and skilled in observation for gen- eral wellbeing of the animals and in procedures they will perform. Sheep and goats should be frequently moni- tored for lameness and other symptoms of ill health. Procedures for which demonstrated proficiency may be required include injections (intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous, shearing, docking, and hoof care (includ- ing detection, treatment, eradication, and prevention of contagious foot rot; and trimming to remove hoof over- growth; and trimming to mitigate other causes of lame- ness). Correction of entropion (eyelids turning inward) should be performed as soon as possible after birth. Im- munization should be provided against clostridial dis- eases. The advice of a veterinarian should be obtained about whether vaccination against other diseases, such as caseous lymphadenitis, rabies, and \"abortion diseas- fetus and does should be boostered against Clostridium perfringens types C and D and Clos- tridium tetani about 2 wk before the start of lambing or kidding to provide protection against enterotoxemia via colostrum (de la Rosa et al., 1997). Care should be taken when handling late-gestation animals because extensive handling can be extremely stressful. It is preferable that lambs and kids nurse their dams (or a foster dam) within 6 h of birth to obtain colos- trum. Otherwise, colostrum should be provided in the period from immediately after birth to 6 h of age as a source of antibodies to avoid disease during the neo- natal period. Suckling is preferred because it triggers the esophageal groove reflex necessary for best immu- noglobulin absorption. However, it is recognized that 145 CHAPTER 10: DOMESTIC SHEEP AND GOATS Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020the experimental protocol may require administration of colostrum via an esophageal feeder. To eliminate a possible route of transfer of disease into research and teaching settings, the practice of using raw colostrum from sources outside the flock to supplement or replace colostrum from a lamb's or kid's dam is not recom- mended. Cow avium ssp. paratuberculosis that causes Johne's disease. In viral diseases, such as lentivirus diseases (caprine arthritis encephalitis and ovine pro- gressive pneumonia), can be transferred through raw ewe and doe colostrum and milk (Herrmann-Hoesing et al., 2007). Heat treating colostrum may reduce the like- lihood of transferring pathogenic bacteria and viruses, but it also may denature antibodies unless a specific protocol is followed (Loste et al., 2008). Detailed infor- mation on management procedures of sheep and goats is described in the Sheep Production Handbook (ASIA, 2015), the Sheep Care Guide (Shulaw, 2005), Goat Med- icine (Smith and Sherman, 2009), Small Ruminant Pro- duction Medicine and Management: Sheep and Goats (Faerber, 2004), Management and Diseases of Dairy Goats (Guss, 1977), Goat Production (Gall, 1981), Goat Management (Mackenzie, 1993), Goat Farming (Mowlen, 1992), and Meat Goat Production Handbook (American Institute for Goat Research, 2007). In addi- tion, a web-based training and certification program for meat goat producers is available at http://certification. goats.langston.edu/. Social Environment Sheep and goats are social herbivores that typically live in flocks or herds of familiar animals and engage in frequent social interactions, especially during the active period of the day (Kilgour and de Langen, 1970). These interactions include establishment or maintenance of a social dominance hierarchy, grooming, competition for space or other resources, or play in young animals. At night, sheep and goats typically bed near others in the flock or herd. Housing sheep and goats in groups of familiar animals is desirable whenever this practice does not conflict with research and teaching objectives. When practical, a minimum group size of 3 is desirable. This provides for continuous social grouping even if one animal is re- moved. If housing with familiar animals is not feasible, then consideration should be given as to how the teach- ing or research outcomes are affected. Social isolation is a source of distress for sheep and goats, and this stress may interfere with many physiological and behavioral variables. Isolation and restraint distress have been ef- fective research tools for studying the effects of distress on physiology, behavior, and well-being (Matteri et al., 1984; Apple et al., 1995; Kannan et al., 2002). Animals that are isolated from the flock or herd or that have recently been separated from close social companions should be monitored frequently to reduce the possibil- ity of injury or distress after separation. Care must be taken when introducing new animals into sheep and goat flocks. Regrouping goats is par- ticularly stressful and may create elevated levels of ag- gression (Andersen et al., 2008; Miranda-de la Lama and Mattiello, 2010). Unacquainted rams or buck goats may fight and severely injure or even kill each other. Although fighting cannot be entirely prevented, several methods can be used to try to decrease its severity. Injuries among newly grouped males can be reduced by severely restricting pen space for a few days to limit the distance available when rams run toward each other to butt heads. After rams appear to have established a social hierarchy, the space can be increased. Goats have a strong social hierarchy, and the addition of several goats to an established group is generally less stressful and more successful than the addition of an individual. Although horned and polled animals may be penned to- gether, provision of extra feeders and space can be used to decrease aggression or social dominance when new animals, especially those having horns, are introduced to a flock or herd. In intensive management, dividing larger flocks or herds into smaller groups, modifying facility design, in- creasing the frequency of observation, and using claim- ing pens (otherwise known as jugs, lambing pens, kid- ding pens, or bonding pens) may enhance the survival rate of neonatal lambs or kids (Dwyer, 2008). If claiming pens do not provide sufficient space for animals to move about freely during labor and parturition, then ewes or does should not lamb or kid in them. Claiming pens can become wet and very difficult to keep clean and become sources of disease. Restricting the periparturient female's movements may increase the chances that dams will step on or lie on offspring. Ewes and does should lamb or kid in a relatively open area that can be observed easily; however, opportunity for self-segregation should also be provided. If possible, they can then be moved with their offspring into claiming pens to ensure bonding. Except in special cases, lambs and ewes should normally be re- moved from claiming pens within 24 to 48 h. Parasite Control Internal and external parasite control is essential, es- pecially when sheep and goats are on pasture. Internal parasite control programs should be devised for each location with the recognition that programs that work for sheep may not be effective for goats at the same location, and vice versa. Most available anthelminthics are no longer adequately effective against Haemonchus contortus, which is the internal parasite of primary con- cern for sheep and goats. Because of this, new internal parasite control programs have been devised that em- phasize the strategic, rather than general, use of an- thelminthics, combined with new diagnostic procedures 146 CHAPTER 10: DOMESTIC SHEEP AND GOATS Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020such as the FAMACHA eye color chart system (Vatta et al., 2001; Kaplan et al., 2004; Yilmaz et al., 2016), alternative treatments and preventatives, and manag- ing to maximize resilience and resistance and minimize the development of infestations. Descriptions of inter- nal parasite control programs can found at the South- ern Consortium for Small Ruminant Parasite Control website (http://www.wormx.info). Small Ruminant Production Medicine and Management: Sheep and Goats (Faerber, 2004) contains descriptions and images of how to administer dewormers (drench) to sheep and goats. There is limited evidence to suggest breed differenc- es in resistance to worms (Dominik et al., 2010; Silva et al., 2012; Romero-Escobedo et al., 2018). However, comprehensive characterization of breeds for resistance or resilience to parasites is lacking. Studies involving natural or artificial parasite infection must have appro- priate protocols for monitoring disease symptoms and for removal and treatment of severely diseased animals. In feedlot or laboratory environments, where pasture is not a potential route for parasite lifecycle mainte- nance, parasites such as H. contortus may not be a con- cern. However, in these same environments, parasites that are not primarily pasture driven, such as coccidia, giardia, and cryptosporidia, may be a greater problem and require added preventative and treatment consid- erations. Coccidia should be a concern when sheep and goats, especially younger animals, are managed under any confined condition, which may include pastures of various sizes (Whittier et al., 2003). Provision of ad- equate clean bedding and ensuring clean feeders can help limit the parasite challenge. External parasites are usually arthropods. They typi- cally feed on the skin, wool, hair, and blood of sheep and goats and cause discomfort. External parasites may also be disease vectors and they can compromise the health and productivity of sheep and goats (Kaufman et al., 2006). Effective external parasite control pro- grams should be developed and implemented to guard the health of sheep and goats. Kaufman et al. (2006) described various external parasites and typical control strategies. SHEARING Because wool breeds of sheep do not shed their wool naturally and fiber is harvested from some breeds of goats, shearing may be necessary for the physical well- being of the animals, depending on specific environ- mental conditions and breed type, and to accomplish research and teaching objectives. Cashmere-producing goats are often sheared as well. Shearing lambs and kids during hot weather may improve feed intake and growth rates. Shearing ewes before lambing can increase lamb birth weights (Kenyon et al., 2006a,b), and it is often easier for newborn lambs to find a teat and suckle when ewes are shorn. In addition, shorn ewes usually transport less moisture into barns or claiming pens, are usually cleaner, and occupy less space. Crutching, the practice of shearing the wool from around the dock and udder, is an acceptable alternative when ewes are not completely shorn. However, shearing ewes before lamb- ing is more desirable if weather and housing conditions are appropriate. Hair-breed sheep and short-haired goats do not re- quire shearing. Wool-breed \u00d7 hair-breed crossbred sheep may occasionally require shearing or partial shearing or they may shed. In any case, the decision of whether to shear wool-breed \u00d7 hair-breed crossbred sheep should be based on the characteristics of the sheep with the goal of ensuring the health and well- being of the animals. The shearing facility should be clean and dry. In- formation on design is given in the Sheep Production Handbook (ASIA, 2015) and in Barber and Freeman (2007). To minimize the spread of infectious disease (e.g., caseous lymphadenitis, which is caused by infec- tion with Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis), shear- ing equipment should be disinfected between flocks. When infectious disease conditions are present or sus- pected, equipment should be disinfected between ani- mals. A good shearer is a skilled professional. A proper shearing technique restrains and positions the sheep correctly to ensure control and comfort of the animal (ASIA, 2015). Electroimmobilization must not be used to restrain sheep for shearing. Ewes in the last third of pregnancy may be shorn if handled properly. To facili- tate the comfort of the animal during shearing, animals may be held off feed and water for 6 to 12 h before they are shorn. Sheep and goats should be dry when they are shorn. After shearing, sheep and goats should have protection from severe cold, windy, or wet conditions. Raised or stubble combs, which leave some wool on the sheep, may be used if sheep are likely to be exposed to inclement winter weather conditions. Another practice when sheep are shorn in cold climates is to increase the digestible dry matter concentration of the diet for a period before and after shearing. In hot, sunny weather, shade may be necessary to prevent sunburn on recently shorn white-skinned animals. Windbreaks, which may also provide shade, are beneficial under many environ- mental conditions. STANDARD AGRICUL TURAL PRACTICES Other management and health practices used in sheep and goat research and teaching that require spe- cial technical training and advanced skills include arti- ficial insemination, semen collection, ultrasound exami- nations for pregnancy detection or predicting carcass traits, embryo flushing and transfer, and venipuncture. The Sheep Production Handbook (ASIA, 2015), Small Ruminant Production Medicine and Management: Sheep and Goats (Faerber, 2004), and several other references cited in this chapter contain descriptions of and im- ages depicting many of these management practices. However, articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals are often the preferred sources for descriptions of spe-147 CHAPTER 10: DOMESTIC SHEEP AND GOATS Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020cialized technical procedures. The publication Produc - ing Customer Products from Sheep: The Sheep Safety and Quality Assurance Program has information that may enhance training programs for people who manage and care for sheep and goats for research and teaching (Hoffman et al., 2013). Tail Docking Tail docking of lambs from wool breeds is performed to reduce the possibility of soiling the long tail with urine and feces and the subsequent development of fly strike, a potentially fatal condition. There are several acceptable methods for tail docking. These include rub- ber rings, hot-iron cautery, surgical removal, and surgi- cal removal after application of an emasculator, and various combinations of the basic procedures (Batta- glia and Mayrose, 1981; Smith et al., 1983; Ross, 1989; Kent et al., 2004; ASIA, 2015). The length of tail that remains after docking has been implicated in the inci- dence of prolapse in sheep. However, vaginal and uter- ine prolapse are only occasional problems in sheep and are even rarer in goats (Miesner and Anderson, 2008). Tails should be docked when lambs are as young as possible, preferably before 2 wk of age. Thomas et al. (2003) evaluated data from several locations with dif- fering genetics to determine whether docking length was related to rectal prolapse. Thomas et al. (2003) implicated short dock length as a cause of rectal pro- lapse in lambs finished on high-concentrate diets. They suggest that docking lambs at the site of the attach- ment of the caudal folds to the tail will result in a negli- gible incidence of rectal prolapse. Goodwin et al. (2007) recommended that \"more research on the issue of rec- tal prolapse as related to the interrelationships of tail length and the effects of diet, stress, and most impor- tant genetics\" be carried out. Lewis (2013) placed rub- ber rings within 24 h of birth just past the distal ends of the caudal folds of the tail of lambs and found that tail length increased from banding to weaning as well as to market weight, and was significantly greater for male lambs that were a black face \u00d7 white face cross. Hence, breed and sex affected the length of the tail as did breed type. Thus, docking a prescribed length will not result in a uniform tail length at weaning or market weight. However, in an underpowered study, Zanolini et al. (2014) found no difference in the number of animals that prolapsed when (1) tails were docked close to the body, (2) tails were docked midway from the attach- ment of tail to caudal folds, or (3) tail was removed at the attachment of the tail to the caudal fold. They also did not find sex or muscling (Callipyge phenotype) in- fluenced the number of rectal prolapses. The incidence of vaginal prolapse reportedly occurs more frequently in dairy breeds of goats (Anderson, 2012). Short dock- ing of lamb tails may also increase risk for joint infec- tions compared with lambs having three or more pal- pable coccygeal vertebrae remaining in the tail stump (Lloyd et al., 2016). The AVMA (2014) recommended length for docking is variously expressed as visibility of 0.7 in of tail, docking at the third or fourth coccygeal vertebrae, or docking at the end of the caudal fold/ hairless under-tail area. When practiced, it is recom- mended that lambs have their tails docked at the site of the attachment of the caudal folds to the tail. Goat kids have an erect tail that should not be docked. Castration Castrated males (wethers) may be preferable to in- tact rams due to reduced agonistic behavior (Fahmy et al., 1999); undesirable odors and flavor of meat from rams (Seideman et al., 1982), and improved meat ten- derness of meat from wethers (Seideman et al., 1982; Sales, 2014). Retention of postpubertal rams and bucks may also pose managerial issues in genetic improve- ment programs, regulating the time of year of lambing and controlling the minimum age of first parturition and lactation. There are 3 commonly accepted meth- ods for castrating rams and bucks: (1) application of rubber rings, (2) crushing the spermatic cord with an emasculator (the Burdizzo method), and (3) surgical removal of the testicles. Various combinations of the 3 are also common. For each method, the lamb's or kid's scrotum should be palpated to make sure that it con- tains 2 testicles and that there is no evidence of an in- guinal hernia. The castration procedure should remove both testicles unless an approved experimental protocol precludes bilateral castration. Detailed descriptions of castration procedures are available in various publica- tions (e.g., Greiner and Wahlberg, 2003; Faerber, 2004; ASIA, 2015). A common recommendation is to castrate lambs and kids when they are between 24 h and 7 d of age, although recommendations vary (Shutt et al., 1988; Lester et al., 1991; Wood and Molony, 1992). Nevertheless, castrating lambs and kids as early in life as possible, considering weather, nutritional stress, en- vironment, and the presence of complicating disease processes, is prudent. Lambs are typically castrated and docked at the same time to reduce the number of times they are handled. Ideally, ewes and does should be vaccinated prepartum against clostridial diseases so that their lambs and kids receive passive immunity via colostrum (de la Rosa et al., 1997). Vaccinating dams prepartum will reduce the incidence of tetanus in their offspring after docking or castration. If ewes and does are not vaccinated prepartum, tetanus antitoxin may be administered at castration and docking when there is risk of tetanus. Acute Discomfort and Pain After Tail Docking and Castration Tail docking and castration can cause acute altera- tions in the behavior of lambs, and the alterations in behavior are consistent with evidence of acute discom- fort and pain (Wood et al., 1991; Sutherland et al., 148 CHAPTER 10: DOMESTIC SHEEP AND GOATS Ag Guide, 4th ed. 20201999; Price and Nolan, 2001; Kent et al., 2000, 2004). It is recommended that tail docking and castration be done at less than 1 wk of age and that either procedure performed on sheep older than 3 mo should be treated as a major surgical procedure using appropriate an- algesia or anesthesia. In young lambs, use of topical anesthesia is recommended following these procedures because it alleviates wound pain, significantly reduc- es pain-related behaviors, and does not compromise wound healing (Lomax et al., 2010). Disbudding and Dehorning Goats without horns are preferred in some situations so as to avoid injury to handlers or animals. Horns on goats (especially non-dairy goats) are common in com- mercial production. If goats are to be disbudded, the procedure should be performed at less than 1 mo of age for ease of the procedure and effectiveness of removing all of the horn bud. Cautery with heat can be used, al- though surgery, freezing, and an acidic paste are other options. Disbudding and dehorning of young goats is painful (Alvarez et al., 2009, 2015; Alvarez and Gutier- rez, 2010). If done incorrectly (e.g., too much pressure, too long application), it can also cause brain injury (Thompson et al., 2005). While local anesthetics (e.g., lidocaine) have proven efficacy with calf disbudding, their use in kids is more problematic. Toxicity (Buttle et al., 1986), causing convulsions and respiratory and potentially cardiac arrest, and general inefficacy to al- leviate pain have been reported (e.g., Alvarez et al., 2009, 2015). Analgesia should be provided for postop- erative pain mitigation. Horns of adult goats should be removed under general anesthesia or sedation with postoperative administration of analgesics due to the anatomy and tissues involved and the significant devel- opment of horny tissue in older goats, especially bucks. Dehorning is not a recommended management prac- tice for sheep. Even though procedures for dehorning ram lambs have been reported, horn growth is not com- pletely eliminated, even after a second procedure ap- proximately 1 mo after the first. Dehorned sites are prone to fly strike, and dehorning does not duplicate the phenotype of genetically polled rams (Dun, 1963). However, the horns of a mature ram may curl and be- come long enough to grow into the ram's head. To pre- vent this, a ram's horns should be trimmed or tipped, but the living tissue inside the horns should not be cut. A fine-toothed saw blade may be used to trim and shape the horns so that they are not a danger to the ram, other sheep, or humans. Mulesing Because of their wrinkled skin and heavy fleece, Me- rino sheep seem to be more susceptible to fly strike, which causes severe discomfort, pain, and often death. A surgical procedure called \"mulesing\" was developed to remove wrinkled, wool-bearing skin and reduce fly strike (Primary Industries Standing Committee, 2006; Paull et al., 2007). Mulesing has been a common prac- tice in a few countries, but not the United States or other countries where Merino sheep are a minor breed. Even though mulesing seems to reduce the incidence of fly strike, it has been severely criticized because of the apparent discomfort and pain associated with the pro- cedure. A combination of a local anesthetic and a long- acting nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may re- duce the discomfort and pain associated with mulesing (Paull et al., 2007). Nonetheless, mulesing should not be performed. ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT Animals benefit from the opportunity to perform natural behaviors. In particular, goats are known climb- ers and benefit from environments that allow for this behavior. Refer to Chapter 4: Environmental Enrich- ment for information on enrichment of sheep and goat environments. HANDLING AND TRANSPORT The Sheep Production Handbook (ASIA, 2015) and Sheep Care Guide (Shulaw, 2005) contain information about handling facilities and transportation. Refer to Chapter 5: Animal Handling and Transport for infor- mation on handling and transportation of sheep. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS Dairy Sheep and Goats Sheep and goats have been used as dairy animals for centuries in many countries. However, dairy sheep and goat research and teaching activities are relatively new in North America. Publications such as Principles of Sheep Dairying in North America (Berger et al., 2004), Management and Diseases of Dairy Goats (Guss, 1977), Sheep Production Handbook (ASIA, 2015), and the New Zealand Code of Welfare: Goats (MPI, 2018) describe the management and care of dairy sheep and goats. Information in Chapter 7: Dairy Cattle of this guide may also be applicable to sheep and goats, although the details are species-specific and management plans should be developed with this in mind. Even though the basic requirements and manage- ment of dairy sheep and goats are similar to those for meat animals, machine or hand milking to harvest milk for further processing introduces several conditions that are unique to dairy animals. These include the design, sanitation, and maintenance of milking parlors, milk handling and storage equipment, frequent animal movement and handling, udder care, increased risk of 149 CHAPTER 10: DOMESTIC SHEEP AND GOATS Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020mastitis, artificial rearing of offspring (Umberger, 1997; Berger et al., 2004), manipulating nutrition to increase and sustain milk yield and quality, greater water re- quirements, increased risk of heat stress, and greater metabolic health risks such as ketosis and pregnancy toxemia (Zobel et al., 2015) due to metabolic demands of milk production. Before research and teaching pro- grams with dairy sheep and goats are initiated, each el- ement of dairy production should be evaluated so that the health and well-being of the sheep and goats are ensured. Zoonotic Diseases Zoonotic diseases, the risk of acquiring zoonotic diseases, how to reduce the likelihood of acquiring a zoonotic disease, and the signs, symptoms, and treat- ment of common zoonotic diseases should be known by people who work with sheep and goats in research and teaching. See Chapter 2: Agricultural Animal Health Care for more information. Predator Control In certain geographic locations and seasons, sheep and goats need to be protected from predators such as dogs, coyotes, bears, wolves, mountain lions, and some species of birds. Contact between unsupervised domestic dogs and sheep and goats should not be al- lowed. Nonlethal means of predator control such as guard animals, lights, noise, and fencing are preferable but may be inadequate or infeasible. Special fencing such as electrified netting may be used to exclude most predators from livestock pastures (ASIA, 2015). Lethal means of control are appropriate when necessary to re- duce injury and loss of sheep and goats. Federal, state, and local laws and ordinances must be followed. Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Wildlife Services, USDA, which provides expertise for resolving wildlife conflicts and protecting agricultural resources, is an important source of information and may be contacted to assist with developing effective and legal predator control programs. Laboratory Environments Certain laboratory settings do not allow for or utilize any range or pasture. These environments may include traditional outdoor feedlots, indoor/outdoor feedlots, or entirely indoor housing with natural or manufac- tured surfaces with several bedding possibilities, such as straw, wood shavings, recycled paper products, sand, dirt, and compost. When housed indoors, goats have been noted to select different flooring surfaces for different behaviors; for instance, hard surfaces for lying and wood shavings for defecation and urination (Sutherland et al., 2017). Therefore, these preferences should be considered when intensively housing goats.Sheep and goats that are used for intensive proce- dures requiring prolonged restraint, frequent sam- pling, complete collection of feces and urine, or other procedures may experience less stress if they are pre- trained and adapted to these environments (Bowers et al., 1993; Hsieh et al., 1996). Sheep and goats may be kept in pens, metabolism stalls, stanchions, respiration chambers, or environmental chambers. If possible, it is recommended that sheep and goats not be housed alone and that they be able to maintain visual contact with other animals (Matteri et al., 1984; Apple et al., 1995; Kannan et al., 2002). Only under scientifically justi- fied and approved protocols that dictate isolation such as metabolic, respiratory, or environmental chambers should such housing be considered for sheep and goats. A common and beneficial practice is to shear sheep and fiber-producing goats before they are moved into intensive laboratory conditions. This improves animal and facility hygiene, often prevents reduced feed con- sumption, and reduces the size of the animals and thus their requirement for usable space. If sheep and goats are managed under intensive laboratory conditions for extended periods, it may be necessary to increase the frequency of hoof trimming. Sheep and goats housed in intensive laboratory en- vironments should be kept clean and dry, and excreta should be removed on an appropriate schedule. Pens and stalls should be washed thoroughly before every experimental period and as needed thereafter. Urine and fecal collection vesicles should be kept clean, and fly infestations should be avoided. Pens, stalls, and stanchions should be large enough to allow sheep and goats to stand up and lie down without difficulty and to maintain normal standing and lying postures. When the activity of sheep and goats maintained in intensive laboratory environments is restricted, they should be observed at least daily. In research settings, automatically recorded measures of activity (e.g., via accelerometers) can be useful. These observations can assist in assessing changes in behavior that potentially result from the imposed treatments, and may add ro- bustness to the study by including behavioral measures. The period of time that sheep and goats may be main- tained in these environments before removal to a larger space for additional exercise should be based on profes- sional judgment and experience. The IACUC should evaluate studies carefully that require sheep and goats to be housed in intensive laboratory environments; and particular attention should be given to the duration that activity is restricted. Opportunities for regular ex- ercise should be provided if exercise does not affect the experimental protocol. For sheep and goats housed in intensive environments, attention should be given to appetite, fecal and urinary output, and soundness of feet and legs. The floor surface of pens in intensive laboratory environments is likely to be less abrasive than the ground surface of outdoor enclosures, and the reduced activity of sheep and goats in intensive labora- tory environments may limit hoof wear.150 CHAPTER 10: DOMESTIC SHEEP AND GOATS Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020Contact of sheep and goats with unwanted animals and vermin, such as birds, rodents, insects, and feral cats should be avoided when possible. Adequate pest- control measures are necessary to prevent bird nests and roosts in barns and sheds. Rodents, which may vector several diseases, should be controlled. Fly strike or myiasis refers to infestation with fly maggots. More specifically, fly strike is a condition in which parasitic, dipterous fly larvae feed on the necrot- ic or living tissue of the host. Control programs, such as using fly parasites, should be considered when fly strike may be a possibility. Mosquitoes can transmit viral agents such as West Nile virus, and mosquito control programs can be instituted to minimize such exposure. Transgenics and Cloning Refer to Chapter 1: Institutional Policies for infor- mation on transgenesis and cloning as they relate to animal care and use. Information on the additional regulatory oversight of transgenic animals and those researchers or institutions working with transgenic ani- mals is available in Guidance for Industry: Regulation of Intentionally Altered Genomic DNA in Animals (FDA, 2018). EUTHANASIA Severely injured sheep and goats or animals that are ill and have a very poor chance of survival should be killed. The AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia (AVMA, 2020) identify several appropriate methods for sheep and goats, including overdose of anesthetic or injection of a euthanasia solution, penetrating captive bolt and exsanguination, or careful lethal gunshot to the head. Nonpenetrating captive bolt options exist for neonate kids and lambs (Sutherland et al., 2016; Grist et al., 2018a,b). Other AVMA-recommended methods may be used if proper equipment and expertise are available. In all cases, a trained and skilled person should kill the animal, and proper animal welfare and handling proce- dures must be followed throughout the process. Federal, state, and local laws and ordinances on car- cass disposal should be reviewed for guidance and fol- lowed. The carcasses of animals that were killed with barbiturates may contain potentially harmful residues, and such carcasses should be disposed of in a manner that prevents wildlife from consuming them. Lairage and Slaughter Lairage should be constructed and managed to ac- commodate sheep and goats between the time of deliv- ery at the abattoir and the time of slaughter. Lairage facilities should be designed and managed so that they prevent injuries and animals can receive proper care and remain safe between delivery and slaughter. Several fac- tors should be considered in relation to animal welfare, food safety, product quality, and research or teaching objectives (Weeks, 2008). Those factors include stock- ing rates and space per animal; safe and effective fenc- ing; shelter to protect animals during extreme weather conditions; well-drained lying areas that can be cleaned thoroughly between groups of animals; pen surface; air quality and quantity (ventilation); noise; lighting ad- equate for monitoring and inspecting animals; isolation pens for sick or injured animals with easy access to the stunning area; ability to provide adequate feed and wa- ter if animals will be in lairage for prolonged periods; design that allows animals to be handled calmly and quietly to avoid unnecessary preslaughter stress; and alleyways that encourage animals to move in the de- sired direction, have as few right angles as possible, and no physical obstructions or artificial or natural lighting arrangements that cause animals to balk. In the United States, all procedures used to slaugh- ter research and teaching animals that will enter the food chain must comply with US Code of Federal Reg- ulations, Title 7, Chapter 48, Humane Slaughter of Livestock (https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/US- CODE-2011-title7/pdf/USCODE-2011-title7-chap48. pdf). The North American Meat Institute (NAMI) has embraced guidelines (https://animalhandling.org/pro- ducers/guidelines_audits) that exceed the regulatory requirements (Grandin, 2017) and the NAMI guide- lines (NAMI, 2019) are incorporated here by reference.

In addition, the chapter discusses animal care guidelines for the par- ent stock for meat-type chickens and turkeys; namely, broiler breeders and turkey breeders. The welfare of meat-type poultry requires the fol- lowing: housing with heating and cooling systems such that birds are at, or close to, temperatures op- timal for their respective ages and with suitable ventilation to ensure a high quality of both air and bedding; availability of feed and water to provide adequate nutrition, with feed and water available at such heights to facilitate eating and drinking and with sufficient space (often expressed as linear space in the feeder) to allow all birds to eat sufficient feed for well-being; programs (such as sanitation, biosecurity, and ap- propriate veterinary care) to ensure prevention and treatment of diseases including endo- and ec- toparasites; facilities designed to minimize the risks of injury to birds and caretakers and to facilitate humane handling; freedom from fear and distress (e.g., this is achieved by minimizing exposure to predators or aggressive conspecifics); and timely euthanasia. It is noted that discussion is limited to where unequivo- cal information is available and is such that proscrip- tive approaches can be included. Where appropriate, enrichment of the bird's environment is encouraged. Importance of Observing Bird Behavior It is important to observe of the behavior of poul- try because this provides an indication of their well- being. For example, chicks or poults exhibit behavioral responses to environmental temperatures\u2014huddling when cold or spreading away from the heat source when too warm. Chickens also pant to dissipate excess heat. It is important to compare bird behaviors with norms within the species. It is useful to observe growing birds, particularly rel- ative to the feeders and waterers, to ensure that all the birds can reach both feed and water. If they cannot, smaller birds are at risk. It is also important to observe social interaction and aggression between birds in the flock and to evaluate any birds that may have a com- promised state of health or welfare. Birds should be inspected at least daily, with in- creased observation frequency depending on the nature of the research. Good communication among caretakers and the principal investigator is important. Caretakers should be instructed to record their visits to the house (date, time, and name or initials), any problems (in- cluding mortality, culling, equipment repair), pertinent observations that were noted during their visit, and any actions taken. Training of Personnel All bird handling must be accomplished in such a manner as to minimize stress and avoid injuries. All personnel working with poultry should be trained in all the techniques that they would be expected to per- form. Ideally, the principal investigator, project leader, or their designee will already have expertise in the re- quired techniques and can directly teach those to oth- ers in the group including students and other people working in the poultry facility. When that is not pos- sible, the principal investigator or project leader should bring in the required expertise from elsewhere in the institution or from outside. Training should, preferably, include one-on-one contact with feedback. Considerations for Broiler Chickens and Turkeys Management systems for broiler chickens, broiler breeders, growing turkeys, and turkey breeders should meet the basic needs of the birds but should also, in situations replicating industry conditions, attempt to optimize production performance. To achieve these CHAPTER 11: MEAT-TYPE POUL TRY 156goals, management must incorporate a plan that in- cludes care, housing, nutrition, ventilation, lighting, and health during pertinent life stages to maximize animal well-being. Researchers and oversight commit- tees may wish to refer to the guidelines from primary breeders available at the breeding company websites; guidelines are updated regularly. These guidelines, in turn, are based on primary literature, when available, such as for photo-stimulation (Renema et al., 2007; Robinson et al., 2007; Zuidhof et al., 2007, 2015), but also on unpublished internal research within a company together with industry experience. Other Considerations for Turkeys, Ratites, and Quail There is a relative paucity of published research on turkeys. Caution is expressed about transferring results from broiler chickens to growing turkeys because there can be markedly different responses, for instance, to different photoperiods (Schwean-Lardner et al., 2016; Vermette et al., 2016a,b). The lack of published re- search is worse for ratites (e.g., ostriches and emus) and quail. In the absence of scientific information, the pres- ent recommendations for turkeys, ratites, and quail are based on professional judgment and experience. FACILITIES AND ENVIRONMENT Housing and environment (e.g., lighting, feed, wa- ter, ventilation) should be planned and implemented for each stage of a bird's life. The housing environment and all equipment utilized in the house should be thor- oughly cleaned and sanitized before bird placement. Housing should be secure to limit exposure of chicks to vermin, wild birds, and disease, and to maintain satis- factory temperatures for chicks. Flooring Poultry may be kept on solid floors with litter or on slatted floors or in cages or pens with raised wire floors of appropriate gauge and mesh dimension or with solid floors. When poultry are placed on solid floors, litter provides a mechanical cushion during motor activity and resting and absorbs water from droppings. Grow- ing broiler chickens and turkeys are typically raised on litter. Ammonia and Noxious Gases Ammonia (NH 3) concentration is a particular issue in broiler chicken and turkey houses because of micro- bial degradation of excreta. Ammonia can negative- ly affect the well-being of the birds and compromise worker health (Kristensen and Wathes, 2000; Miles et al., 2004). The ideal NH 3 concentration is less than 10 ppm, whereas a concentration less than 25 ppm is the normal industry standard for ammonia concentration. Adequate ventilation can assist in lowering NH 3 below the threshold concentrations so that bird well-being and worker health are not compromised. It is recom- mended that ammonia concentrations at both bird and researcher levels are checked on a regular basis (e.g., immediately before placement and during grow-out) and more frequently when ventilation is low. Litter Management Litter in a broiler house should provide bird com- fort, low dust, biodegradability, and moisture absorp- tion (De Jong and Van Harn, 2012). Litter should be neither too dry and dusty nor too wet. One field test is to squeeze some litter in the hand. If it clumps together but readily breaks apart when prodded, the moisture level is adequate. Poultry will be negatively affected by either excessive dust or wet litter. Footpad dermatitis (FPD) and hock burns (HB) can be indicators of im- paired welfare (e.g., Dawkins et al., 2004; Shepherd and Fairchild, 2010). Litter quantity and quality influence both FPD and HB, with lower litter depth associated with increased incidence of FPD and HB (e.g., Haslam et al., 2007). Moreover, the incidence of FPD is higher in winter and related to poor litter conditions (e.g., Dawkins et al., 2004; Haslam et al., 2007; Meluzzi et al., 2008). The increase in FPD in winter is related to reduced rates of ventilation, elevated atmospheric humidity, and greater litter moisture associated with a much higher percentage of birds having dirty food pads (Dawkins et al., 2004). Litter moisture is also related to heater positioning and number of drinkers (Dawkins et al., 2004). In addition, elevated concentrations of NH3 arising from moist litter can impair broiler health (Dawkins et al., 2004). Maintaining records of the inci- dence of FPD and HB is encouraged. Litter Broiler chicks and turkey poults should be placed and raised on fresh bedding or litter materials such as pine or hardwood shavings or rice hulls. At placement and brooding, ensure the litter is evenly spread to a depth of 7.5 to 10 cm (3 to 4 in). The condition of the litter is very important to the well-being of growing broiler chickens or turkeys. The litter should be as free of contaminants as possible and consistently available from a reliable biosecure source. The preferred litter materials in many areas are pine shavings, sawdust, or rice hulls. However, the use of these may be limited by cost and availability. Alternatives include the follow- ing: hardwood shavings and sawdust (disadvantage: a tendency for high moisture and susceptibility to mold growth), pine or hardwood chips (disadvantage: may be associated with the development of breast blisters), chipped pine or hardwood bark, peanut hulls (disad-157 CHAPTER 11: MEAT-TYPE POULTRY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020vantages: lack of general availability and susceptibil- ity to mold growth), coconut husks (disadvantage: lack of general availability), sand (disadvantages: requires good management due to susceptibility to retain wa- ter and difficulty in ensuring optimal floor tempera- ture; usually requires concrete floors), crushed corn cobs (disadvantages: lack of general availability; may be associated with the development of breast blisters), chopped straw or hay (disadvantage: risk of caking and mold), straw pellets (disadvantage: high water holding and hence wet environment), chemically treated straw pellets (disadvantage: must be used following supplier's instructions), processed paper (disadvantage: risk of caking and difficulty of management in humid areas), peat moss, and flax straw. Recycled (reused) litter may be used to ensure that the research is relevant to in- dustry practices. There are risks of excess moisture or contamination with pathogens (Dumas et al., 2011); these may be reduced by top-dressing with fresh shav- ings or a new litter substrate (Coufal et al., 2006) and removing wet litter. Turkey Poult Flooring/Deep Litter Poults (newly hatched turkeys) should be placed and raised on fresh bedding or litter materials such as pine or hardwood shavings or rice hulls. At placement and brooding, ensure the litter is evenly spread to a depth of 7.5 to 10 cm (3 to 4 in). The condition of the litter is very important to the well-being of growing turkeys. Wet litter can result in FPD (reviewed by Glatz and Rodda, 2013). Litter adjacent to feeders and waterers is likely to become damp due to accumulation of drop- pings or water spillage and may need to be raked or tilled to facilitate drying. Recycling used litter and cov- ering damp bedding with fresh bedding are also accept- able. The litter should be maintained as friable and dry. The litter (sampled in the middle of the barn) should be friable; that is, loosely compacted in the hand when squeezed. Wet or caked litter may be tilled to dry it. Maintaining records of the incidence of FPD and HB is encouraged. Lighting The lighting program is a management technique that consists of light wavelength, photoperiod, and light intensity (Olanrewaju et al., 2006). Light is de- tected by the eyes and extra-retinal photoreceptors (e.g., Foster et al., 1985; Mobarkey et al., 2010). En- dogenous daily rhythms or circadian clocks are located in cells in the hypothalamus and elsewhere, including the pineal gland, and they can be entrained by light. Melatonin is a hormone produced in the pineal gland and is involved in feed and water intake, regulation of body temperature, and immune function (Apeldoorn et al., 1999). It is secreted in a circadian rhythm, with higher concentrations produced during the dark period and lower concentrations during the light period, which suggests that optimum performance requires a diurnal light cycle containing a dark period. Broiler Chickens. Growth performance, meat yields, leg abnormalities, and behavior of broiler chickens are influenced by lighting programs. In the past, research- ers have utilized constant day length to optimize perfor- mance objectives. However, Schwean-Lardner and col- leagues (2012, 2013, 2016) reported decreased growth performance and meat yields, increases in both mortal- ity and leg abnormalities, and compromised well-being in broilers on very long day lengths (23L:1D; that is, 23 h of continuous lighting, simulating day, and 1 h of darkness, simulating night) compared with birds under day lengths of no more than 20 h of light. Broiler chick- ens grown at 20L:4D and 23L:1D had higher mortality and cull losses than those grown under longer scotope- riods (the period of darkness; Schwean-Lardner et al., 2016). Light duration is frequently continuous (24 h of light per day) during the first 2 d of brooding to optimize chick activity levels and facilitate the chicks finding feed and water. Lighting can then be slowly decreased (in intensity and duration) to achieve the expected rearing light program by 2 to 3 wk of age. After broilers reach 7 d of age, the photoperiod should include at least 4 h of darkness per day [<0.5 lx or <0.05 foot candles (fc)]. Subsequently, beginning 1 wk before processing age, the photoperiod may be returned to continuous light- ing. A constant light period will not interrupt the feed passage rate in broilers undergoing a feed withdrawal period before processing. Attention should also be given to light intensity. Providing constant lighting coupled with lighting in- tensity of 20 to 60 lx (1.8 to 5.6 fc) from 1 to 7 d of age allows birds a good start during brooding. Very low light intensity has been reported to lead to blindness in poultry (Cummings et al., 1986; Buyse et al., 1996). In contrast, Miller et al. (2007) reported no differences in corneal lesion score when broilers were subjected to varying lighting intensities (2.0 vs. 0.20 lx; 0.2 vs. 0.02 fc) from 8 to 36 d of age. It is suggested that the lighting intensity during the photophase from 8 d of age be at least 5.0 lx (0.5 fc) to avoid eye damage or blindness. Broiler Breeders. Lighting should be controlled dur- ing the rearing period for broiler breeders to optimize flock uniformity, promote bird growth and activity, and control sexual maturation. Lighting duration should be 8 h/d, and lighting intensity should be 5 to 10 lx (0.5 to 1.0 fc). Lighting should be tightly controlled during phase 1 (about 21 wk to first egg) of the laying period to optimize flock uniformity, promote sexual matura- tion, and control the onset of lay. To achieve sexual maturation and egg production, day length is increased from 8 h/d to approximately 15 h/d over several weeks. Increases in hours of light can be achieved via a set program with planned increases over several weeks. Al-158 CHAPTER 11: MEAT-TYPE POULTRY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020ternatively, increases may be adjusted in accordance with the body weight (BW) and condition of the hens. In addition, to achieve optimal reproductive perfor- mance, lighting intensity is increased from 5 to 10 lx (0.5 to 1.0 fc) to 40 to 60 lx (4 to 6 fc). If open-sided or curtain-sided housing is used during the laying pe- riod, artificial daylight must always bracket the hours of natural daylight. Growing Turkeys. Growing turkeys can thrive in a wide variety of lighting programs. It is common to use long light periods (i.e., 23 h/d) for the first few days to ensure that poults can find food and water. In the early post-hatching period, a period of darkness of at least 4 h should be used (National Turkey Federation, 2016) with up to 8 h per 24-h period commonly used. However, growth rates to 126 d old are maximal under 14L:10D, with a progressive reduction in growth rate as photoperiod increases as follows: 17L:7D > 20L:4D > 23L:1D; the lower growth rate at the longest day length is coupled with much greater mortality and cull losses (Schwean-Lardner et al., 2016). Light intensity can be reduced if necessary to alleviate injurious pecking and other harmful behavior such as excessive mounting. Breeder Turkeys. Lighting (intensity and duration) is a major factor influencing turkey reproduction. Turkeys are photostimulated; that is, brought into reproductive condi- tion by long day lengths (e.g., Grimes and Siopes, 1999; Siopes, 2010). Photostimulation is the process of increas- ing day length to cause sexual maturation and mainte- nance of reproduction. Photorefractoriness is a condition in which birds become insensitive to the stimulatory ef- fect of long day length. Photorefractoriness is terminated when birds are placed on a short daily photoperiod. Unfortunately, data from the research literature on optimal conditions for raising and breeding turkeys are very limited. It should not be assumed that practices for broiler breeders automatically apply to breeding turkeys. The following synopsis of husbandry is derived from information available from Aviagen turkeys, the primary breeder of both Nicholas and BUT turkeys. Turkey pullets destined to be breeders (0-17 wk old) can be raised in a day length of 10 to 14 h of lighting per day with a light intensity of 80 to 100 lx (8 to 10 fc). The extended photoperiod allows sufficient time for feeding. Subsequently, day length is normally reduced to a short day length (e.g., 6L:18D) with a moderate light intensity of 20 to 100 lx (2 to 10 fc). The short photoperiod prevents both sexual development and photorefractoriness (Siopes, 2010). After a period on short day length and when they are close to the age of puberty, turkeys are photostimulated. It is common to use long light periods (i.e., 23-24 h/d) with minimal light intensity of 86 lx for the first 3 d, followed by 10 to 14 h of light per day. Light intensity can be reduced to minimize injurious pecking (Grashorn, 2011; Schwean- Lardner et al., 2016). It is important not to decrease light once the stimulatory phase before the onset of egg production has been initiated (particularly important in fall and winter; Grimes and Siopes, 1999). Alterna- tively, at 30 wk old, the pullets can be photostimulated with a long photoperiod (e.g., 14L:10D) and a higher light intensity; for example, 120 lx (11 fc). Breeding Ratites. The breeding season for ostriches is about 8 mo (217 d) from mid-May to mid-December in the Southern Hemisphere (South Africa; Brand et al., 2015a,b). This is consistent with ostriches being short- day breeders; that is, having their reproductive system develop and function by a stimulatory short-day length or photoperiod. Similarly, emus are short-day breed- ers, becoming reproductively active in the autumn and winter (Malecki et al., 1998; Blache et al., 2001). To bring emus and ostriches into reproductive condition, a short daily photoperiod of 10L:14D or lower lengths of photophase are required. Breeding Quail. A photoperiod of 16 h of light and at least 22 lx (2 fc) is required for maximal egg production in breeding quail (Randall and Bolla, 2008; Molino et al., 2015). Ventilation Proper ventilation removes dust, moisture, carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) and provides oxygen (O 2). During brooding, it is important to ensure the absence of drafts. At later ages, when excreta vol- ume is greater, ammonia (NH 3) must also be removed. Adequate ventilation will keep bedding dry and friable. The range of relative humidity (RH) should be 50 to 65%, CO 2 concentration <3,500 ppm, CO <10 ppm). It is important to ventilate the house to remove all waste gases (CO 2, NH 3) and bring in fresh air to assure good air quality throughout the birds' liv- ing space. Ventilation is also important to control tem- perature and humidity in accordance with bird needs and comfort (air quality and litter quality). Ventilation systems should be checked daily. The facility should have an emergency ventilation system (i.e., curtain drop, generator, alarm) to provide minimum ventila- tion when power is lost. Broiler Chickens. During hot weather, ventilation is particularly important to remove metabolic heat and water vapor from evaporative cooling pads and pant- ing birds. Winter ventilation is needed to remove at least half of the metabolic heat (sensible:latent ratio of 50:50). Broiler Breeder Chickens. During the laying phase for broiler breeders, it is especially important to pro- vide adequate ventilation during the feeding period be- cause birds will be more active and generate more met- abolic heat while eating. The ideal temperature range for a breeder flock is between 15\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C (59\u00b0F and 77\u00b0F).159 CHAPTER 11: MEAT-TYPE POULTRY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020Temperature Brooding. Supplemental heating should be provided for chicks for the first 2 wk of life. Chicks/poults re- quire supplemental heat for the first few weeks (\"brood- ing\"). Without supplemental heating, mortality may be greatly increased. Two common brooding methods are conventional and whole-room brooding. In both cases, temperatures are lowered gradually as the chicks or poults age. Conventional brooder stoves provide heated areas where the chicks/poults can seek their comfort zone. With this system, the chicks/poults are tempo- rarily contained by \"brooder rings,\" which are card- board or solid flexible fences. The heat source is near the center of the ring, and feed and water are nearby. Whole-room brooding requires a higher room tempera- ture and no drafts. Chicks/poults that are too cold will huddle together so tightly that suffocation can occur, especially if there are corners in the brooding area. The living space should be preheated before the chicks/poults arrive to ensure the floor or litter is warm and the air is at the goal temperature when the chicks/ poults are placed. Minimum ventilation rates should be applied from the day before the chicks arrive. En- vironmental temperature should always be maintained for bird comfort in accordance with the recommended temperature guide for bird age. In addition to measure- ment of actual temperature, bird behavior and flock distribution should be evaluated daily to assess bird comfort. If chicks/poults are too cold, they will huddle. If chicks are too hot, they will move away from the heat source and will pant. Chicks/poults that are com- fortable should be evenly distributed throughout the brooding space and should exhibit a variety of normal behaviors (e.g., eating, drinking, resting, actively mov- ing) while the lights are on. Summer Temperatures. Actual temperature can fluctuate beyond the set points in research facilities during the summer months. High temperatures can re- duce feed intake, decrease growth rate, and increase the incidence of mortality. Air velocity can lower the effec- tive temperature via heat removal. Even though the target temperature may not be maintained for broilers, an effective temperature with the use of fans and mist- ing systems or cool cell pads may allow for adequate growth and livability objectives during a summer pro- duction period. The effective temperature is that which birds ex- perience when air movement removes heat (sensible heat loss), even though the actual temperature may not meet the target temperature. Evaporation of water through the use of cooling pads or misters can also re- duce the effective temperature. Air velocity and cooling pads can reduce the effective temperature by between 9 and 12\u00b0C. Relative humidity (RH) affects the optimum temperature for poultry. For instance, the optimal tem- perature for 27-d-old Chapter 3: Husbandry, Housing, and Bi- osecurity for a more detailed discussion. Turkeys. The optimal temperature for growing tur- keys decreases during growth. For example, one breeder (Aviagen) recommends a conventional brooding tem- perature during wk 1 of 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F), a gradual decline to 13\u00b0C (55\u00b0F) in wk 13. Heat stress markedly affects growing turkeys (Glatz and Rodda, 2013). Older turkeys (>10 wk of age) tolerate cool con- ditions (7.2-15.6\u00b0C; 45-60\u00b0F) but are susceptible to hot weather (>32.2\u00b0C; >90\u00b0F). Temperatures exceed- ing 35\u00b0C (95\u00b0F) are life threatening if airflow is not adequate. Growing Quail. Newly hatched chicks should be maintained at 35\u00b0C (95\u00b0F) for 1 wk; then, the tempera- ture can be reduced by 3.5\u00b0C (6.3\u00b0F) per week until 4 wk of age (Randall and Bolla, 2008). Alternative Systems: Outdoor Access or Free Range Organic production of poultry meat has expanded at more than 15% per year (Crandall et al., 2009; Fanatico et al., 2009). In organic poultry production, access to the outdoors is required (USDA, 2010). No differences in a series of metrics of stress were reported between pasture and conventional poultry production systems (Liles et al., 2015). Moreover, one factor to be consid- ered for studies in which poultry have access to pasture is the presence of Campylobacter and possibly other food-borne pathogens. Although the rate of contami- nation of chickens with Campylobacter in Sweden was about 9%, the rate in broiler chickens on pasture was 70 to 100% (Engvall, 2002). Care should also be taken to protect animal caretakers from such food-borne patho- gens. The following are recommended for the outdoor areas for organic production and for pasture-raised or free- range poultry: Ranges or pastures free of debris and muddy areas (in the event of areas becoming waterlogged or muddy, slats should be provided). Fencing with fine netting to protect from preda- tors. Ideally, fencing is extended into the ground to a minimum depth of 0.25 m (0.82 ft). Overhead fine netting to protect poultry from birds of prey. Vegetation (including grasses, crops, and bushes) to minimize soil erosion. Range rotation is suggested to reduce pathogens. Shelter from rain should be available. Openings (pop-holes or doors) with baffles should be available to allow birds to move from outdoors to indoors and vice versa. There is a greater risk of passage of pathogens from wild birds to poultry raised with access to pasture. En-160 CHAPTER 11: MEAT-TYPE POULTRY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020suring biosecurity is critically important for poultry with access to pasture. FEED AND WATER It is again emphasized that researchers should con- sult with breeder guides for chickens and turkeys for feed and water requirements. Water Water should be sourced from a potable water sup- ply if possible. Water from wells or open water sources should be continuously sanitized with an appropriate sanitizer such as free chlorine or chlorine dioxide (Wat- kins, 2008). Drinking water should not contain excessive amounts of minerals (particularly nitrate) and should not be contaminated with bacteria. Water equipment should be checked daily. Water should be provided ad libitum each day at least when lights are on. If there are concerns about water spillage and birds playing in water, water can be restricted or turned off when the lights are off, because birds are not generally active during this period. The height of the drinker should be adjusted for bird height to ensure easy access at all times and reduce spillage. When possible, daily water consumption should be re- corded as a standard welfare and good management practice. Substantially reduced or limited water in- take will negatively affect bird welfare and well-being, growth, and egg production. Broiler Chickens Feed form for broilers can consist of mash, crumbles, or pellets. Broilers are typically fed diets in crumble form in the starter period, with subsequent feeds pre- sented as whole pellets. However, mash feed may be used fed in experiments using small amounts of feed or with feed additives that may be heat labile. Feed is provided in either pan or trough feeders located inside floor pens or battery cages. In battery cages, trough feeders can be attached on the outside of the cage, allowing broilers access to only one side of the trough, which reduces the linear feeder space. Feed space guidelines recommend 1.9, 2.5, and 3.2 cm of linear trough space/bird (0.75, 1.0, and 1.25 in of linear trough space/bird) for broilers <1.5 kg, 1.5 to 3.3 kg, and >3.3 kg, respectively (<3.3 lb, 3.3 to 7.25 lb, and >7.25 lb, respectively). Linear trough space is based on both sides of the trough being avail- able. If only one side of the trough is available, feeder space/bird should be doubled. For commercial housing, manufacturers size the feeder pans to accommodate 50 to 75 birds per pan. The number of birds per pan de- pends upon bird size and distance between pans. Be- cause floor pens of a research facility have a different dynamic than a commercial broiler house, it is recom- mended that a pan feeder should not exceed 50 birds per feeder, and pens having broilers with final weights exceeding 3.0 kg (6.6 lb) should be limited to 40 to 45 broilers per pan feeder. Pan feeder height should be adjusted frequently af- ter 14 d of age so that the lip of the pan is at a height equivalent to about the mid-point of the wing at that age. This will avoid placement of the feeder either too low or too high as the bird advances with age. Feeders at ground level are useful in providing chicks access to feed for the first week of age. Feeder lids or trays placed on the floor to help newly hatched chicks find feed should be filled to only one-quarter to one-half capacity to avoid feed wastage. A strong relationship exists between water and feed consumption and optimal well-being, growth rate, and feed efficiency in broiler chickens. Broilers should have continuous access to clean drinking water unless other- wise required for experimental or vaccination purposes. However, when water intake is naturally low; for ex- ample, during the dark period when birds are inactive, control of the water supply may help reduce unneces- sary water leakage (De Jong and Van Harn, 2012). Pro- viding ample drinker space is paramount to achieving adequate water consumption. Water can be provided in troughs, cups, or nipples. Water drinker guidelines for trough waterers consist of 0.5 and 1.3 cm/bird (0.2 and 0.5 in/bird) for 0 to 4 wk of age and 4 to 8 wk of age, respectively. Battery cages are not used widely for broiler chickens. However, when they are, specific issues can arise. In battery cages, trough waterers can be at- tached from the outside of the cage, allowing broilers access to one side of the trough. This reduces the linear space to which broilers have access; hence, the space requirement should be doubled. Supplemental drinkers (3.78 L or 1 US gal) can be provided to chicks from 1 to 7 d of age to ensure adequate water intake, par- ticularly for pens equipped with trough waterers. Cup and nipple drinkers can supply 28 and 10 birds per device, respectively, during a 9-wk production period. For example, a floor pen containing a drinker line with 5 nipple waterers can provide adequate drinker space for 50 broilers. The water flow rate of nipple drinkers can vary among the types of nipple drinkers and thus it is important to follow the manufacturers' recommen- dations. It is useful to verify flow rates by determining water flow rates for the nipple type used. Water During Brooding for Broiler Chicks. Perma- nent drinkers are subsequently removed by approxi- mately 3 to 4 d of age to transition birds to the pri- mary drinker source. The height of the primary drinker source should be adjusted for bird height to ensure easy access at all times as birds grow and should be high enough to reduce spillage. Feed and Broiler Chicks. Presentation of food in the form of good quality, small crumbles is necessary to 161 CHAPTER 11: MEAT-TYPE POULTRY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020achieve proper feed intake in the first week. Feeding equipment should not be placed directly under or too close to the brooders because this can result in feed be- ing too hot. Feed should be distributed just before the chicks' arrival. During the initial brooding phase, one feeder tray or lid should be provided per 75 chicks. To encourage chick activity and good crop fill, ensure that supplemental feeders remain full and are replenished regularly so chicks do not consume stale feed. For the first 12 to 24 h after placement, it is recom- mended that the crops of a random sampling of chicks be palpated to ensure that they are eating and drink- ing, and thus adjusting to the new equipment and en- vironment. Supplemental feeders (trays or bucket feed- ers) should be moved in stages toward the permanent feeders and then removed by approximately 12 to 14 d of age to transition birds to the primary feeder source that will be used throughout the rearing period. The height of the primary feeder should start at floor level and then be adjusted for bird height as the birds grow. Broiler Breeder Chickens. The content of the diet is important during all 3 phases of the rearing period; namely, starter, grower, and finisher. Caloric content is important so that birds never lose weight during the rearing period but must also be monitored so that weight gain and development are controlled. Presenta- tion of the poultry diet in the form of a good quality, small crumble or mash feed during the rearing phase is recommended to ensure good feed intake and adequate distribution of the feed to the entire flock. Insufficient feed amount or feeder space will negatively affect feed intake, BW, and bird uniformity. Chicks should transi- tion to the primary rearing feeding equipment (pans or trough) by d 14. Feed rationing should be designed to achieve target stock-specific BW. Feeder Space During Rearing of Broiler Breeders. During the ad libitum feeding period, allow 4.0 cm (1.6 in) of trough space per bird. During the controlled feed- ing period, a minimum trough space of 15.0 cm (5.9 in) per bird or 11.5 cm (4.5 in) per bird for pan feeders should be used so that birds can eat at the same time. Feed Restriction of Broiler Breeder Pullets During Rearing. Controlled feeding is necessary during the rearing period to control BW and prevent skeletal and other abnormalities that occur with excessive weight (reviewed by Cassy et al., 2004; Tolkamp et al., 2005; de Beer and Coon, 2007; de Beer et al., 2007, 2008; Rich- ards et al., 2010). Controlled feeding may be achieved by restricting the days of feeding (e.g., using skip-a-day feeding) or by restricting the amount of daily feed (e.g., using less feed per period for every-day feeding). The recommendations of industry guides can be used, these being based on published and proprietary research. In both examples, feed should be distributed throughout the house quickly to ensure that all birds have adequate accessibility to the feed because flocks will consume all the feed within 30 to 45 min.Water for Broiler Breeder Chickens. Ideally, the same drinker equipment used in rearing should be used for birds in the laying phase. Bell drinkers should be in- stalled at the rate of 1 per 60 to 70 birds, and nipple drinkers should be installed at the rate of 6 to 8 birds per nipple. If separate drinker equipment is used for roosters in the scratch area, this drinker may be slightly elevated so that it is primarily and easily used by males and not by females. The goal of this elevated male drinker line is to limit spillage and wet litter in the scratch area, but also to encourage females to use their primary drinker line on the slats and thus be closer to the nests for laying eggs. In such a setup, the recom- mended distance of the water line to the nest is 60 to 70 cm (23.6 to 27.6 in). Feed for Broiler Breeder Chickens. Insufficient amounts of feed or feeder space will negatively affect feed intake, BW, egg production, and bird uniformity. For the first 2 to 3 d after transition to the laying housing, it is very helpful to palpate the crop of a ran- dom sampling of hens and roosters to ensure that they are eating and drinking, and thus adjusting to the new equipment and housing. Female birds should be fed according to BW and to the recommended breed standard from the time of trans- fer to the onset of lay. Feed increases should be planned in advance to reach the desired BW and to stimulate egg production, and should be coordinated with increases in the hours of light per day. Controlled feed increases optimize egg production and will reduce the risk of obese hens and the risk of egg size becoming too large, and will also reduce mortality associated with prolapse, fatty liv- er syndrome, heart attack, sudden death syndrome, and so on. Initially, in phase 1 (pre-lay to initiation of lay) of the laying period, females are normally given small in- creases in feed until they reach 5% egg production. After this, they enter phase 2 (from beginning of the laying period through completion of the production cycle) of the laying period and then receive feed increases in rela- tion to egg production. Peak feed consumption should correlate with 60 to 70% hen-day egg production. To exclude males from the female feeder, a restriction grill can be used on trough feeders. Males should never lose weight during the laying pe- riod. However, feed must be controlled to avoid excess BW and excess condition (breast muscle fleshing) be- cause both of these can have a negative effect on fertil- ity, male mating activity, and bird health and welfare. After 16 wk of age, males should receive small increases in feed to maintain BW and allow testes development. If possible, males should be moved to the laying house or pen a few days before the females to enable the males to adapt to their new environment and to fa- cilitate their learning where to find their feed. This is especially important if there is a change in feeder type (e.g., trough to pan) for the roosters. The following space requirements are recommended: a minimum of 15 cm (6 in) of feeding space per fe-162 CHAPTER 11: MEAT-TYPE POULTRY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020male for one-sided linear feeders or 12 females per pan. Moreover, there should be a minimum of 15 cm (6 in) of feeding space per male or 8 males per pan or as indi- cated in the latest breeder management guide. The feeding period during the laying period must be monitored each day to control the BW of broiler breed- ers. Males and females should be fed daily via separate feeders. Both should be fed early in the morning. Feed for females should be distributed first in such a way to ensure that all hens have adequate access to feed. Females should consume their total feed within 2.5 to 3.0 h. Male feed can be distributed via pan feeders or trough feeder (fixed position, not swinging). Ideally, the male feeder should be elevated and have the daily ration pre-allocated in the feeder before feeding time. After female feed has been distributed, the male feeder can be immediately lowered so the roosters can easily access the feeder. This management procedure will re- duce the number of females taking feed from the male feeder, will reduce aggression between roosters at the time of feeding, and will promote better rooster unifor- mity. Scratch feed may be distributed on the litter in the afternoon to encourage mating, improve fertility, and to provide the hens with an additional source of calcium. If used, a maximum of 0.50 kg per 100 birds should be distributed via the broadcasting (scattering feed) method. Nutrition of Broiler Breeder Chickens. The content of the diet is important during all phases of the laying period. Caloric content, protein content, and calcium content are all critical so that the hens have good liv- ability and can produce good-quality hatching eggs. A different diet may be used for the end of phase 2, when hens still require adequate calcium but need fewer calo- ries. Male feed should allow the roosters to maintain BW and condition, but males should not have a high caloric intake because this will result in obesity and decreased fertility. Turkeys Growing Turkeys. Feed can be provided ad libitum or in daily portions. Feeding and watering equipment can vary widely. For specific space guidelines and operat- ing instructions, seek advice from the equipment manu- facturer. A general guideline for linear feeder space is 2.5 cm (1 in) per poult. Feed should be provided in a texture and size that is age appropriate. A crumble or mash feed should be fed to poults less than 4 wk of age. Pelleted feed (>4 mm; >0.16 in) or mash can be fed to older birds. Drinking water may be provided ad libitum or during the light period. Turkey Breeders. Feed can be provided ad libitum or in daily portions; in each case, there will be a recom- mended diet depending on age and breed. For specific requirements, follow the latest breeder specifications of the relevant line. Check the feeders daily and keep them clean and free from shavings, debris, and manure. Equipment for feeding should be checked daily. Either pelleted feed or mash can be used. Ratites Ostriches. Ostriches are the largest bird and are her- bivorous and grazers. They should not receive chicken feed; rather, their diet should reflect their requirements. Plant materials are subject to grinding by stones in the muscular gizzard. Therefore, ostriches need stones in their diets (Deeming and Bubier, 1999). To utilize plant cellulose, ostriches are post-gastric or hindgut fermen- ters and have a slow gastric passage rate of about 48 h (Cilliers and Angel, 1999). In the adult ostrich, the ceca are 90 cm (35.5 in) long and the colon is 16 m (52.5 ft) long (Beziudenhout, 1999). Because of this, the me- tabolizable energy (ME) of feedstuffs in ostriches differs from that of other poultry species. Cilliers and Angel (1999) concluded that \"the use of ME values derived from poultry in diet formulation for ostriches results in an underestimation of the true ME content of ingredi- ents for ostriches.\" Ostriches are raised on pasture with shelter provided. If the stocking density is between 0.1 and 1.0 birds/ha (0.04 to 0.4 birds/acre) on pasture, damage to the pas- ture can ensue (Deeming and Bubier, 1999). Research indicates that some pastures are thought not suitable for ostriches; for example, Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon; Cilliers and Angel, 1999), whereas alfalfa or lucerne (Medicago sativa) pastures are highly suitable for raising ostrich (Smith et al., 1995). Ratite pens should to be fenced, with 9-gauge chain-link fencing preferred (Barron, 1995), with fences 1.8 to 2.4 m (6 to 8 ft) high (USDA-FSIS, 2013). Nutritional require- ments for lysine and sulfur amino acids peak at 9 and 6.5 g/d at 200 d of age for male ostriches (du Preez, 1991). There are dietary recommendations for growing os- triches (Cilliers and Angel, 1999) with, for instance, lysine requirements increasing from 2.5 g/d at 30 d of age to 14 g/d from 180 d to maturity (Cilliers and An- gel, 1999). The following diets may be used: prestarter (20.5-22% protein) from 0 to 2 mo old, starter (18-20% protein) from 2 to 4 mo old, grower (15.5-17% protein) from 4 to 6 mo old, finisher (13-14% protein) from 6 to 10 mo old, and a maintenance diet (10-12% protein) from 10 mo old (Cilliers and Angel, 1999). Feed requirements for breeding ostriches include the following (du Preez, 1991): 230 g/d of protein, 14.8 g/d of lysine, and 16.5 g/d of sulfur amino acids. It is suggested that breeding pairs be fed 3 times a week at a rate of 5.0 kg of dry matter per pair per day (9.2 MJ of ME per kg of feed) with water avail- able ad libitum (Brand et al., 2015a). Feed ingredients can include alfalfa meal, oat bran, corn, wheat bran, and alfalfa hay, with protein from soybean oil cake and sunflower oil cake (Brand et al., 2015a,b). During the 163 CHAPTER 11: MEAT-TYPE POULTRY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020breeding season, birds should be fed 2 kg of ration/bird per day (4.4 lb/bird per day) [180 g of crude protein (CP), 10 MJ] supplemented with fresh alfalfa (pek and Diets should be supplemented with lime- stone (3.5%) and calcium phosphate (2.1%), to meet the calcium requirement for producing egg shells, and can be pelleted (Brand et al., 2015a,b). A vitamin and micro-mineral premix should be added to the diet for optimal egg production and hatchability (reviewed by Cooper, 2001). Diets for adults outside the breeding season can be 1.5kg/bird per day (3.3 lb/bird per day) of pelleted, dried alfalfa (pek and ahan, 2004). The water requirement of ostriches is high. Water intake of the adult ostrich is about 8 L/d (2.1 gal/d) with losses of water including (Skadhauge and Dawson, 1999) 3 L (0.8 gal) in feces, 2.5 L (0.66 gal) in urine, and 3 L (0.8 gal) lost to evaporation. Emus. Emus can be raised on pasture with a night shelter and, in addition to forages, receive supplements of barley, alfalfa, and canola (Menon et al., 2013). Breeding Emus. The calcium requirement for ratites should be increased to over 2.0% of the ration when egg laying (reviewed by Cooper, 2001). Quail A diet containing 24% CP and 12.1 MJ of ME/kg is recommended by the National Research Council for Japanese quail during the growth period (NRC, 1994); turkey grower diets may be used (Randall and Bolla, 2008). The lysine requirement is estimated to be 1.34% of diet between 3 and 5 wk of age (Mehri et al., 2015). Quail diets should be supplemented with taurine to im- prove immune functioning (Wang et al., 2009). Feed and water are usually provided ad libitum (e.g., Ak- barnejad et al., 2015). Diets for breeding quail should contain 24% CP, 11.7 MJ of ME/kg, and 3.0% calcium (as limestone or ground oyster shell) when birds consume 16 g of feed/d (Randall and Bolla, 2008). HUSBANDRY Chickens and turkeys are social species and should be maintained in groups when possible. However, so- cial environments in which birds exhibit aggression are stressful to poultry and should be avoided. Aggressive behaviors are influenced by group size (Estevez et al., 2003) and genetics, with broiler breeder male chickens exhibiting higher levels of aggression than layer-strain males (Millman et al., 2000). Fighting can lead to in- jury or worse (death). To avoid aggressive interactions, sexually mature toms are housed separately from hens. Reports on bird condition should include a statement on injuries and overt aggression.Broiler Chickens Brooding Broiler Chickens. Brooding is one of the fundamental aspects of broiler management. Maintain- ing an optimum environment for the young chick is nec- essary to achieve performance objectives. The problem with not maintaining proper brooding temperatures is that chicks cannot regulate their body temperature until about 2 wk of age. Chicks that are exposed to low brooding temperatures are often found huddling along feed and water lines, which usually results in their consuming inadequate amounts of feed and water. Conversely, chicks that are subjected to high brooding temperatures will pant in an effort to reduce their body temperature. The research facility (floor pen house or battery room) should be preheated to the desired temperature set point 24 h before chick placement. The desired tem- perature can be influenced by the heat source used. Primary breeder guides are an excellent resource for temperature guidelines for various ages of chicks. Forced-air furnaces provide heat in the form of hot air. Hot air will eventually heat the floor, but the floor temperature is usually a few degrees lower than the air temperature. Factors such as house tightness, tempera- ture sensor location, and drafts can affect the difference between the air temperature and the floor temperature. Managing these factors can determine the actual suc- cess of using this type of heating system. Brooders provide heat to chicks in the form of infra- red light rather than generating hot air. Infrared light heats the object it strikes. The temperature of the floor will decrease as the distance from the brooder increas- es. The advantage of this type of heating system is that birds can control the amount of heat they receive, in that they can move close to the brooder to obtain more heat. Air temperature is not as critical because infrared light heats the floor; therefore, bird performance should not be as dramatically affected by a house having drafts compared with heating with forced-air furnaces. Stir fans coupled with regular inspection can minimize tem- perature stratification in the facility. Stocking Density During Brooding of Broiler Chicks. To optimize proximity to feed, water, and the heat source, a brooder guard (or ring) may be used to limit the space allowance during brooding. The maximum stocking density for chicks in a surrounded brooding area should be 40 chicks/m2. If a brooder guard is used to limit chick distribution during brooding, the enclosed area should be gradually increased in size over the first 7 to 10 d until the chicks are given access to the full pen or house. The brooder guard should be removed by 7 to 12 d of age. Stocking Density and Broiler Chickens. Stocking density can influence the well-being of broilers. Stock- ing density should take into consideration housing (en- closed vs. open-sided), environmental, and local climat-164 CHAPTER 11: MEAT-TYPE POULTRY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020ic conditions. High stocking density rates have been reported to adversely affect growth performance, car- cass yield, and skin scratches and tears, increase NH 3 production, foot pad lesions, litter moisture, and heat stress, and decrease locomotion and preening (Estevez et al., 2003; Dozier et al., 2005, 2006). Stocking density is often expressed as the number of broilers per meter squared; however, body mass per unit area may affect bird performance more dramatically than the number of birds in the same space. Body mass per floor area, based on final BW at the end of the flock, is a prefer-able method to express stocking density, particularly for studies emulating industry-type conditions (floor pens). A facility must have adequate ventilation rates and litter conditions to allow the recommended maxi- mum stocking densities. Stocking density at placement is calculated based on projected final BW at the end of the growout period minus the expected incidence of mortality. Examples of maximum stocking density consistent with indus- try practices are as follows (National Chicken Council, 2015):Table 11-1.

Minimum floor area specifications on a bird basis for multiple-bird pens and cages and individually housed broilers from 1 to 9 wk of age are presented in Table 11- 1. In battery cages, it is important to note that broilers should stand comfortably without hitting their heads on the top of the cage. Also, broilers exceeding 2.8 kg (6.2 lb) reared in cages may start to develop lameness possibly because of lack of exercise. If this occurs, broil- ers should be removed from the study. Broiler colony cage systems represent an alternative for rearing broiler chickens in research and teaching. It is suggested that animal condition reports include gait score, indicating the ability of birds to walk to feeders and drinkers. Broiler Breeder Chickens The management of broiler breeders is divided into 2 periods: rearing and lay. The rearing period can be further divided into 3 primary development phases: (1) From 1 to 6 wk of age: this early growth phase is critically important because this is when the frame size (body size as indicated by skeletal de- velopment) and uniformity (similarity of body size) are determined for the flock. (2) From 6 to 16 wk of age: this is a maintenance phase, when the birds should be maintained under a controlled feeding program designed to prevent them from becoming overweight. (3) From 16 wk until transition to the laying house: this is the pre-lay, development phase in which growth rate is accelerated to prepare the flock for sexual maturation and to achieve proper uni- formity and fat coverage before the lay cycle. The laying period can be further divided into 2 pri- mary phases: (1) From about 21 wk to first egg: the pre-lay phase, when hens and roosters are commingled and stimulated with light and feed to become sexu- ally mature. (2) From first egg to end of production cycle: the laying phase. During the rearing phase, broiler breeders are nor- mally kept indoors with environmental control to regu- late sexual maturation and limit exposure to disease. Breeder management guides provide recommended stocking densities for males and females and suggest that males should be grown separately from females during rearing (until 21 wk). Stocking density should take into consideration specific requirements of differ- ent housing types and local climatic conditions. During the laying phase, males should be commin- gled with females at a ratio of 7 to 9% males to 91 to 93% females. If fertility is low, more males may be needed to maintain fertility. If roosters are overly ag- gressive, a lower ratio of roosters to hens may be neces- sary. The stocking density or space per bird is normally 0.19 to 0.26 m2/bird (2.0 to 2.8 ft2/bird), but this can vary depending on the flooring (slatted or litter) and the type of housing (open-sided or enclosed with tunnel ventilation). The recommended density of hens for nests is 4 to 5 hens/nest for manual nests and 6 hens/nest for rol- laway nests. Hatching eggs should be collected from the nest at least 3 times daily. During peak egg produc- tion, more frequent egg collection may be necessary to optimize egg quality and egg sanitation. Nests should be monitored for cleanliness, and nest pads or litter should be replaced when soiled. Any floor eggs should be collected as soon as possible and kept separate from clean nest eggs to avoid contamination. If the breeder flock is provided with outdoor access or is an outdoor- only flock, the frequency of egg collection may need to be increased. Turkeys Rearing and Maintenance. To raise and manage tur- keys reared for meat and turkey breeders with care and success, it is recommended that the latest management instructions of the relevant genetic stock be followed. Growing Turkeys. Poults can successfully be placed at a stocking density of 0.07 to 0.09 m2/bird (0.75 to 1.0 ft2/bird) in the brooder house up to approximately 6 wk of age. For growing and market-aged turkeys, the maximum recommended commercial stocking density is 73 kg/m2 (15 lb/ft2) (National Turkey Federation, 2016). Turkey Breeders. It is recommended that the follow- ing checks be performed daily: drinkers, feeders, ven- tilation, sick or injured birds and mortalities; and the following checks performed weekly: BW and egg pro- duction. Nest boxes should be kept clean. Eggs may need to be removed from nest boxes at least once per hour to prevent broodiness. Hens need time to familiarize themselves with the laying environment. There must be sufficient nest space per hen, typically a maximum of 7 hens per nest box. Management should follow the latest breeding company instructions. Toms should be kept to the target weight (age and breed specific) via tailored feed management; that is, feed with adapted protein level or provision of predetermined amounts of feed.166 CHAPTER 11: MEAT-TYPE POULTRY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020Ratites Pairs of ostriches can be maintained in breeder camps or paddocks. Breeding paddocks have been used suc- cessfully. These can be between 0.25 and 0.5 ha [0.6 and 1.25 acres] with either little or no pasture (Van Niekerk, 1996; Brand et al., 2015a,b). Breeding pairs of emu can be held in a fenced pen at least 8 m wide \u00d7 20 m long (26 ft wide \u00d7 66 ft long; Animal Welfare Advisory Committee, 1998). Quail Breeding quail supply eggs both for chicks to be grown for meat and for eggs. These breeding quail are often housed with 1 male and 2 or 3 females, with the group having 145 cm2 (22.5 in2) of floor space per bird or 125 cm2 (19.5 in2) per bird on wire floors (Randall and Bolla, 2008). STANDARD AGRICUL TURAL PRACTICES Skilled personnel should carry out handling of birds and all procedures described in this section. Beak Conditioning in Turkeys Trimming of the beak tip is done to minimize injury and death due to aggressive and cannibalistic behavior. Pecking at the feathers or head directed at conspecifics can result in injury (Duggan et al., 2014), which can re- sult in mortality or the need to cull. Pecking is reduced by removal of the distal portion of the beak (Glatz and Rodda, 2013), commonly at the hatchery. Beak conditioning is a common practice to reduce harmful pecking and cannibalism. The available evidence, albeit limited, indicates that beak trimming is either painless or of minor effect, with no effects on fearfulness, tame- ness, or resting behaviors (Noble et al., 1996) and im- proved growth rates and feed efficiencies (Noble et al., 1994). Moreover, it has been reported that pain recep- tors are absent in the dermis proximal to the trimmed beak (Gentle et al., 1995). The process may done at the hatchery before birds arrive at a research site. One such technique uses a high-intensity light beam to kill tissue at the tip of the upper beak. The beak sloughs off by 2 wk of age. Toe Trimming Because of the size and weight of the broiler breeders and turkeys involved and the sharpness of their toe- nails, broiler breeder males and market turkeys gener- ally have toes trimmed to prevent them from inflicting serious injuries to hens during natural matings or to pen-mates or to caretakers. Claw (\"toenail\") condition- ing is sometimes done at the hatchery to reduce skin scratches caused by toenails. A microwave beam is ap-plied to the tip of the toes. The toenails slough off by 2 wk of age. A less common method is the use of a hot-blade device. It is frequently assumed, based on evidence such as the absence of pain receptors or other nerves and by analogy to nail trimming in humans, that toe trimming is painless. However, there is evidence of shifts in behavior and performance after toe trimming. These may be indicative of some impairment of welfare (Proudfoot et al., 1979; Fournier et al., 2014, 2015). Snood Removal Turkeys have a frontal process called a snood, which is an ornamental appendage for the adult male. The snood can be a target for pecking by other birds or grasped by other turkeys during fighting and can be torn or damaged (reviewed by Dalton et al., 2011). Snood removal is achieve with small scissors or similar cutting implements. It may be performed at the hatch- ery, for instance, on poults destined to be breeder toms. It is presumed that this technique is painless, but there is an absence of literature supporting or refuting this. ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT Refer to Chapter 4: Environmental Enrichment for information on enrichment of poultry environments. Environmental enrichment involves adding features to the environment to allow natural behaviors (Leone and Est\u00e9vez, 2008). Caution is expressed as to whether enriched environments should be mandated for meat- type chickens or turkeys or broiler breeders or breeding turkeys in view of the limited research demonstrating improved well-being with specific enrichments. There is some research, for instance, with platforms with ramps for accessibility (Norring et al., 2016; Bailie et al., 2018). It is suggested that platforms with ramps, perches, or substrates for dust bathing or other enrich- ment techniques be provided for broiler chickens, adult broiler breeders, and turkeys (growing and adult breed- ers) where appropriate. HANDLING AND TRANSPORTATION Refer to Chapter 5: Animal Handling and Transport for information on handling and transportation of poul- try. Additional information on ratites is included below. Safe Handling of Ratites Handling of ostriches can cause falls and injury, with greater numbers of injuries reported with handling than with loading and unloading for transportation (Minka and Ayo, 2008). Adult ostriches and emus can be re- strained by a V-shaped crush arrangement (Animal Welfare Advisory Committee, 1998). For ostriches, but not emus, hooding the head may be useful with a shep- herd's neck crook facilitating placement of a hood on 167 CHAPTER 11: MEAT-TYPE POULTRY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020the head (Animal Welfare Advisory Committee, 1998; Bejaei and Cheng, 2014). Bejaei and Cheng (2014) state that \"After being hooded, it [the ostrich] would calm down (in less than 1 min) and could be walked to the sampling pen without resistance.\" Blood sampling is often more easily conducted in hooded ostriches (Be- jaei and Cheng, 2014). It is not clear, however, whether hooding per se is stressful. Transportation of Ratites The ostrich anatomy, with a high center of gravity (heavy body) and feet with just 2 toes, makes it dif- ficult for ostriches to maintain balance during trans- portation (Bejaei and Cheng, 2014). Welfare of ratites can be compromised by transportation (Mitchell, 1999; AHA, 2012). Transportation has been reported to be followed by increases in 2 indices of stress: plasma concentrations of corticosterone and heterophil to lymphocyte ratios (Menon et al., 2014). Transportation for distances over 500 km results in BW reductions (Bejaei et al., 2014). In addition, body temperature is noted to increase in emus during transportation (Menon et al., 2014). It is recommended that adult ratites be transported in single-decked livestock transportation trailers with a density of 0.5 m2/bird (5.4 ft2/bird; AHA, 2012) and at night (Crowther et al., 2003). INCUBATION AND HATCHING The sections on incubating broiler breeder eggs and turkey eggs below cover large-scale incubation in in- dustry and represent the state-of-the-art at the time of writing. It is emphasized that the procedures may need to be modified for incubation on a smaller scale and in a research and academic settings. Broiler Breeder Eggs Two primary broiler breeder companies\u2014Aviagen (including Ross; http://en.aviagen.com/) and Cobb- Vantress Inc. (https://www.cobb-vantress.com/)\u2014cur- rently parent stock for broiler breeder strains. Incubation and hatching are covered in detail in their respective manuals, which are available on the compa- nies' websites. The following provides a succinct summary of the re- quirements of incubation and hatching for broiler chick- ens. Incubation accounts for approximately one-third of the life of broiler chickens. Therefore, the requirements for incubation are critical. Factors that affect the suc- cess of incubation requirements include the following: and cleanliness, temper- ature, humidity, and ventilation. Eggs are incubated for the first 18 to 19 d in a setter room or incubator and then transferred to a hatcher room or hatcher. Con- trol of temperature and humidity in the incubator and hatcher is very important to hatching healthy chicks. Egg Characteristics. Certain eggs should be rejected and not incubated due to the presence of poor quality characteristics that may negatively affect hatchability and chick quality. These characteristics include cracked or damaged eggs (e.g., damaged by toe puncture), misshapen eggs (e.g., round or elongated), excessively small or large eggs, and eggs with poor shell quality (e.g., slab-sided or wrinkled). Egg Cleanliness. Hatching problems can occur with dirty eggs due to increased bacterial contamination of the hatchery equipment. Nest eggs are preferable over floor eggs because they should have less soiling and will be collected more frequently. Slightly soiled eggs can be incubated, but they should not be wiped clean or washed. Wiping or washing will remove the cuticle that protects the egg from contamination. The egg handling room in the chicken house should be maintained in a clean and tidy manner with an effective insect and ver- min control program. Egg Storage. Once eggs have been collected from the breeder house, they should be placed in incubation trays with the small (pointed) end of the egg facing down and stored in a cooler or cool room until pickup for the hatchery. Primary breeder companies recom- mend that eggs from modern broiler stocks be stored at temperatures ranging from 15 to 21\u00b0C (59 to 69\u00b0F), with the cooler temperatures recommended for longer periods of storage (see, for example, Aviagen, 2020; Cobb-Vantress, 2020). These same companies recom- mend relative humidity (RH) of 50 to 80% for storing eggs. Eggs can be stored for 7 to 8 d before hatchability decreases. After storage for 10 d, there is a marked de- crease in hatchability. Incubation Temperature. Incubation of broiler eggs requires 21 d. Eggs should be prewarmed at 24 to 27\u00b0C (75 to 80\u00b0F) before incubation. For the first 18 to 19 d of incubation (in the setter), eggs should be maintained at 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F). A temperature of 1\u00b0 above or below 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F) can reduce overall hatchability. Eggs are transferred from the setter to the hatcher on d 18 and the temperature decreased to 36.7\u00b0C (98\u00b0F). Incubation temperature can be measured by moni- toring eggshell temperature, which is an indirect mea- surement of an embryo's temperature. This can be measured with an infrared ear thermometer placed on the shell of the egg below the air cell. The optimal incubation temperature for chicken eggs is an eggshell temperature of 37.8 to 38.2\u00b0C (100 to 101\u00b0F). Variance in this temperature (higher or lower) can have a nega- tive effect on embryonic mortality, chick weight, and organ development. Incubation Humidity. The humidity within the incu- bator is also crucial for a successful hatch. Typically, 168 CHAPTER 11: MEAT-TYPE POULTRY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020the humidity in the setter needs to be maintained at 58 to 60% RH. An approximate 11 to 12% loss of egg weight occurs during the first 18 d of incubation due predominantly to loss of water vapor from the egg. When eggs are transferred to the hatcher, RH should be increased to 68 to 70%. Humidity is commonly ex- pressed as a wet bulb temperature. The RH in the set- ter (58 to 60%) represents a wet bulb temperature of 28.9 to 30\u00b0C (84 to 86\u00b0F), and RH in the hatcher (68 to 70%) represents a wet bulb temperature of 31.1 to 32.2\u00b0C (88 to 90\u00b0F). Incubator Ventilation. The embryo continuously re- quires O 2 and releases CO 2. It is critical that the CO 2 concentration in the incubator does not exceed 0.4%. To ensure proper gas exchange, fresh air is provided to the growing embryo throughout incubation. Ventilation rates are as follows: Setter room: air movement/ventilation of 13.5 m3/h per 1,000 eggs [8 ft3/min (cubic feet per minute, CFM) per 1,000 eggs]. The room should have a positive or higher pressure compared with atmospheric. Hatcher room: air movement/ventilation of 28.7 m3/h per 1,000 eggs (17 CFM per 1,000 eggs). The room should have a positive or higher pres- sure relative to atmospheric pressure. Chick holding room: air movement/ventilation of 67.6 m3/h per 1,000 eggs (40 CFM per 1,000 eggs). The room should have the same pressure as atmospheric pressure. Egg Turning. During the first 18 to 19 d of incuba- tion, eggs must be turned; that is, rotated through 45\u00b0 per rotation 3 or more times per day, to prevent the embryo from adhering to the eggshell membranes, to aid in uniform airflow around the egg, and for other critical factors. After egg transfer to the hatcher, eggs should no longer be turned. Transfer from Setter to Hatcher. The transfer from the setter to the hatcher should be conducted with ef- ficiency and care to avoid unnecessary cooling of the eggs. Problem eggs can be removed at this time. Prob- lem eggs include infertile eggs (as determined by can- dling) and cracked or rotten eggs (rots and exploders). Transfer is also the time for vaccination if conducted by the in ovo approach. After hatch and removal of the chicks and egg residue, hatchers must be cleaned and disinfected before more eggs are placed in the machine. Chick Holding Room. Chicks can be moved from the hatcher to the chick holding room when their down is dry. The temperature of the holding room should be 23\u00b0C (73\u00b0F) with RH of 65 to 70%; the room should be free of drafts. Fertility and Hatchability. Fertility of the eggs can be predicted by candling the eggs at 10 to 12 d of incu- bation. This can be assessed on individual eggs with a candling light or on a flat of eggs using a candling table. Final fertility assessment should be based on the total number of chicks hatched and include an assessment of hatch residue (nonhatched eggs). Although fertility is highly correlated with the health and management status of the breeder flock, embryonic livability can also be affected by factors such as flock age, egg handling, and incubation management (temperature and humid- ity). If eggs in the machine have a low rate of fertility or a higher rate of embryonic mortality, the machine (setter or hatcher) will have to compensate for the loss of embryonic heat production. Turkey Breeder Eggs Egg Handling. Proper egg handling is important to reduce or eliminate harmful organisms from passing through the eggshell surface as it cools. It is recom- mended that hens be encouraged not to lay eggs out- side nest boxes. Eggs should be collected at least twice per day, sanitized, and then placed in an egg cooler. Nests should be checked weekly for proper operation (e.g., opening, closing, and so on). Incubation Requirements. Turkey eggs are typically held for 24 to 25 d in an incubator (or setter) and then transferred to a hatcher cabinet for an additional 3 to 4 d until hatching. In the incubator, eggs should be rotated 3 or more times per day to prevent the em- bryos from adhering to the eggshell. Eggs should not be turned within 3 d of hatching. Controlling incubator and hatcher temperature and humidity is very important to hatch healthy poults. Proper temperature and humidity settings for hatchery equipment can vary by manufacturer and type (still vs. forced air, single vs. multistage). For specific ma- chine settings and operating instructions, seek advice from the equipment manufacturer. To ensure the cor- rect incubation temperature, eggshell temperature can be monitored, this being an indirect measurement of an embryo's temperature. Eggshell temperature can be measured with an infrared ear thermometer. The ther- mometer is placed below the air cell of the egg on the outside of the shell. An eggshell temperature of 37.4 to 37.8\u00b0C (99.4 to 100\u00b0F) is optimal. Humidity can be monitored by weighing a sample of eggs before incuba- tion and then at transfer to the hatchery. Eggs should lose 10 to 12% moisture by d 25 of the incubation pro- cess. Hatching Requirements. For specific machine set- tings and operating instructions, it is recommended that advice be sought from the equipment manufac- turer. If incubator and hatcher conditions are correct, pipping should begin approximately 36 h before sched- uled removal (\"pull\"). Overheating of the poults in the hatchers is a concern and is indicated by a high body temperature. Body temperature is measured by insert- ing a thermometer probe into the cloaca. Optimal tem- peratures should be between 39.4 and 40.0\u00b0C (103 and 104\u00b0F). Body temperatures exceeding 40.6\u00b0C (105\u00b0F) will result in panting and potentially dehydration.169 CHAPTER 11: MEAT-TYPE POULTRY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020Ratite Eggs Ostrich Eggs. Ostrich eggs can be stored at 17\u00b0C (63\u00b0F) and RH of 35 to 75% after disinfectant treat- ment (Van Schalkwyk et al., 1998; reviewed by Coo- per, 2001). With prolonged storage (>3 wk), hatching rate decreases (Deeming and Ar, 1999). Egg fertility rates are very variable, ranging from <50% to >85% (Deeming and Ar, 1999). The incubation temperature should be 36.5\u00b0C (98\u00b0F) (Deeming and Ar, 1999), which is lower than that for chicken's eggs. Features of ostrich egg incubation include the following: Egg weight: 1.5 kg (range 1.0 to 2.0 kg) [3.3 lb (range 2.2 to 4.4 lb)] (Deeming and Ar, 1999). Incubation at 36.0 to 36.5\u00b0C 98\u00b0F) (Hassan et 30% RH (pek and ahan, 2004). Egg turning: Eggs turned every hour through a 60\u00b0 or 90\u00b0 angle (Brand et al., 2015a). Eggs turned through an angle of 45\u00b0 per hour (pek and ahan, 2004). Incubator ventilation is important to remove CO 2 and water vapor; 48 m3/h (1,700 ft3/h) air re- placement per 1,000 eggs is recommended (Deem- ing and Ar, 1999). Time in incubator: After 35 d, the eggs are moved to a hatcher at 36\u00b0C and 24% RH (Brand et al., 2015a). At 39 d, the eggs are transferred to a hatch- er at 36\u00b0C (pek and to (pek and ahan, 2004). Weight of 1-d-old ostrich chick: 0.8 kg (1.75 lb; Cilliers and Angel, 1999). Chicks are allowed to dry off in the hatcher for up to 24 h and can then be transferred into an intensive chick rearing facility (Cloete et al., 2001). Chicks should be initially raised at 30 to 32\u00b0C (86 to 90\u00b0F) at a den- sity of 6 chicks/m2 (6 chicks/10.6 ft2). Access to the outdoors may be provided (Verwoerd et al., 1999). The density should be decreased by 10% per week and temperature gradually reduced to 26\u00b0C (79\u00b0F) at 3 wk old (Verwoerd et al., 1999). High rates of mortality have been reported in the first 90 d of post-hatching growth and development: 47% in the first 28 d and 31% between 28 and 90 d (Cloete et al., 2001). The basis for the high mortality is not well established. Emu Eggs. Key features of emu egg incubation are to 57 d (Brake and Rosseland, 1995). Quail Eggs Japanese quail eggs should be stored at 10 to 16\u00b0C (50 to 61\u00b0F; Cain and Cawley, 1974). Eggs may be fu- migated either immediately after collection or before incubation. Japanese quail eggs can be incubated suc- Randall and Bolla, 2008). SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS Biosecurity Biosecurity is essential for poultry to minimize risks from pathogens such as Salmonella, Mycoplasma, avian influenza viruses, or other infectious agents that could harm bird welfare, compromise research or instruction, and represent a threat to commercial and privately owned poultry flocks or public health. Many highly infectious pathogens that infect poultry originate in wild birds. Mechanisms for the spread of pathogens among poultry flocks include movements of personnel, vehicles, equipment, and dead birds contaminated with pathogens; aerosol droplets and dust particles contami- nated with pathogens; and vermin such as mites, rats, litter beetles, and flies. Researchers are encouraged to review the 14-point biosecurity standards of the Na- tional Poultry Improvement Plan (undated). Proximity is an important issue in the spread of pathogens. This applies to the physical distance and the shared inputs (e.g., staff, equipment, vehicles) between and among research or teaching poultry units, com- mercial facilities, and backyard flocks (USDA-APHIS, 2015a). With closer proximity, biosecurity plans must be more rigorous. Biosecurity can be envisioned under 2 categories: structural and operational biosecurity (USDA-APHIS, 2015a). The following practices are recommended to ensure biosecurity: Each research/instruction poultry facility should have a biosecurity officer (institutional veterinar- ian or equivalent) and provide biosecurity training for all personnel. A biosecurity plan should include standard oper- ating procedures encompassing cleaning and dis- infection of equipment and buildings; provision of protective clothing for personnel; installation and maintenance of footwear sanitation stations; quar- antine procedures; limiting access to the facility; a perimeter buffer area and a line of separation 170 CHAPTER 11: MEAT-TYPE POULTRY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020between buildings; and depopulation measures in the event of a disease outbreak. When feasible, biosecurity is best maintained when personnel shower and change into clean clothes and be disinfected before entering a poul- try research unit and before moving between such units. Biosecurity control measures must be in place to protect poultry from pathogens that can be car- ried by wild birds, rodents, and insects. Equipment must be sanitized thoroughly between uses. The goal should be to restrict sharing of equipment between different research and teach- ing poultry units. External bird sources should be certified flocks and free of primary poultry diseases (Mycoplasma, Salmonella, avian influenza). Birds should be transported in vehicles that have been cleaned and disinfected appropriately. Drinking water should be from potable sources where possible. Feed and fresh litter must be stored and handled to prevent access by rodents or wild birds and hence contamination with viruses or other infec- tious agents. Informing regulatory and other animal health professionals immediately of possible disease out- breaks as appropriate (based on USDA-APHIS, 2015a,b, 2016a,b). Biosecurity is particularly important to ostrich rais- ing. Ostriches should not be housed in proximity with other livestock or poultry if possible (Perelman, 1999). Poultry in Biomedical Research and Other Special Considerations In some biomedical and other intensive research stud- ies and various teaching programs, poultry may need to be housed in different conditions. These special circum- stances include embryonated eggs during hatching in small-scale incubators and metabolic chamber studies. Genetically Modified Birds To date, there are no special animal care require- ments for transgenic or cloned poultry. Transgenic birds are cared for in the same manner as convention- ally domesticated birds unless the genetic manipulation affects basic bird needs. Refer to Chapter 1: Institu- tional Policies for general information on the care and use of genetically modified animals. Surgeries All intrathoracic and intra-abdominal invasive sur- geries require anesthesia. Caponization, or removal of the testes, is an invasive surgical procedure that re-quires anesthesia. See the sections in Chapter 2: Agri- cultural Animal Health Care that deal with surgery of experimental animals. Artificial Insemination Modern commercial strains of turkeys are bred by AI. For a review of AI in poultry, see Bakst and Dy- mond (2013). The major reason for using AI in turkeys is to ensure the safety of the females because the act of copulation can injure the hen. Males are housed sepa- rately from females to protect the hens from aggression by tom turkeys. Collection of semen requires careful management and manipulation of the tom. It is recom- mended that excreta be removed and the tom's abdo- men cleaned before collecting semen. For maximal fertility, the semen should be applied to the female within 30 min of collection. Changes in semen temperature should be avoided during transpor- tation. If semen needs to be stored longer than 30 min, follow semen storage instructions as indicated in profes- sional breeder management guidelines. EUTHANASIA Euthanasia recommendations follow those of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) Panel on Euthanasia (Leary et al., 2020) (also see Euro- pean Union recommendations; Close et al., 1997). The mechanisms for euthanasia are as follows: (1) depres- sion of cortical neural activity and specifically neurons required for functions critical for life; (2) hypoxia due, for instance, to exsanguination; and (3) physical dis- ruption of the brain or its activity (Leary et al., 2020). Acceptable Methods for Embryonated Eggs Embryonated eggs (<80% of incubation) may be de- stroyed by chilling or freezing at a temperature of 4\u00b0C (39\u00b0F) for 4 h. Decapitation or anesthetic or CO 2 over- dose are suitable methods for older embryos (AVMA, 2020). Acceptable Methods for Chicks and Pipped Eggs Only methods of euthanasia approved by the AVMA (AVMA, 2020) can be used. Rapid maceration or dis- placement of oxygen with N 2, CO 2, or other approved gas are preferred methods of euthanasia for cull chicks and pipped eggs. Personnel must be trained for the method in use. Acceptable Methods for Growing and Adult Chickens and Turkeys Methods of euthanasia accepted by the AVMA (AVMA, 2020) can be used. The following methods of 171 CHAPTER 11: MEAT-TYPE POULTRY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020euthanasia that, in addition to other AVMA-approved methods, are acceptable: (1) Rapid decapitation. (2) Rapid cervical disarticulation, normally between the skull and first cervical vertebra. If a tool is used it should separate, but not crush, the verte- brae. (3) Displacement of O 2 with CO 2 or another ap- proved gas. (4) Captive bolt for large birds, including non-pene- trating captive bolt. (5) Intravenous injection administration of overdos- es of anesthetics, specifically barbiturates (bar- biturate and barbituric acid derivatives). These drugs are controlled substances and \"must be administered by personnel who are registered with the US DEA [US Drug Enforcement Ad- ministration], and extra-label use requires ad- ministration by or under the supervision of a veterinarian\" (Leary et al., 2020). Disadvantages of this approach include that the meat cannot be consumed by animals or humans, and any biochemical or artifactual changes may confound experimentation. (6) Low atmospheric stunning (controlled atmo- sphere stunning). (7) Electrocution. (8) Gunshot (free-range birds only). Acceptable Methods for Ratites An accepted method of euthanasia for ratites consists of rendering unconscious by electrical stunning before killing by bleeding (Animal Welfare Advisory Commit- tee, 1998). SLAUGHTER In the United States, slaughter of animals entering the human food chain must comply with regulations as outlined in the Federal Humane Slaughter Act (Code of Federal Regulations, 1987). The processing area for poultry slaughter should be designed and managed to minimize bird discomfort and distress (Nijdam et al., 2005). The manager or person in charge of the pro- cessing area should be competently trained in animal slaughter and is responsible for training all staff to car- ry out their duties responsibly and humanely. The holding area for birds to be processed should be adequately ventilated and protected from temperature extremes and adverse weather such as wind, rain, sleet, snow, and hail. Upon arrival, birds should be inspected to ensure that none are injured or suffering from heat or cold stress. Injured birds with signs of severe stress should be humanely killed or slaughtered immediate- ly. Birds should be processed as soon as possible once they arrive at the slaughter facility. All birds should be slaughtered within 12 h of feed and water withdrawal. Feed withdrawal minimizes microbial contamination of the carcass by preventing breakage of the gastrointesti- nal tract (e.g., the crop) during processing. Electrical Stunning Following industry practice (National Chicken Coun- cil, 2013), electrical stunning should be used to render poultry unconscious or insensible to pain before slaugh- ter by exsanguination. Exceptions to this practice in- clude when slaughter has to be consistent with Islamic (halal) or Jewish (kosher) dietary practices. Stunned birds may recover consciousness quickly; therefore, ex- sanguination should be accomplished immediately after stunning to avoid recovery from consciousness. Elec- trical stunners adjusted for sufficient current (Bilgili, 1999) should render birds immediately insensible before neck cutting, and they should remain insensible during exsanguination. Acceptable stunners include a hand- operated stunner, stunning knife, a dry stunner incor- porated into a metal bar or grid that is electrically live, or an electrical water bath. Handheld electrical stun- ners may be used for shackled birds or for birds that are restrained in a cone. Exsanguination (after stun- ning) is an effective method of slaughter, particularly if both carotid arteries are completely severed (Gregory and Wotton, 1986, 1988). Alternatively, it is effective to severe both the carotid artery and jugular vein on one side. Controlled Atmosphere Stunning Controlled atmosphere stunning is achieved by in- creasing the CO 2 partial pressure, by very low O 2 par- tial pressure, or both (Hoen and Lankhaar, 1999). Con- trolled atmosphere stunning is increasingly being used for commercial slaughter in Europe (reviewed by Berg and Raj, 2015) and, to some extent, in North America (Gregory, 2005). This can entail CO 2 initially at <40% to achieve unconsciousness and then 80 to 90% CO 2 or CO2 in combination with either nitrogen or argon (Berg and Raj, 2015). Single and 2-phase controlled atmospheric systems have been compared (Abeyesinghe et al., 2007; McK- eegan et al., 2007a,b). hypercapnic anoxic mixture of 60% argon, 30% CO O 2. The biphasic hypercapnic hyperoxygen- ation mixture was 2, and 30% N2 (anesthetic phase), followed by 80% CO 2, 5% O 2, and 15% N 2 (euthanasia phase). Hypobaric hypoxia stunning (reduced atmospheric pressure stunning) is another method to achieve uncon- sciousness (Purswell et al., 2007). Stunning is achieved by progressive hypobaric hypoxia with final atmospher- ic pressures of <26.6 kPa (<199 mm Hg or 0.26 atm) (Purswell et al., 2007). Evidence based on physiological and behavioral metrics indicates that this method is 172 CHAPTER 11: MEAT-TYPE POULTRY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020as humane as other methods of controlled atmosphere stunning (Martin et al., 2016). Evidence that hypobaric hypoxia stunning is a humane system comes from the lack of increase in heart rate (McKeegan et al., 2013) or circulating concentrations of the stress hormone cor- ticosterone (Vizzier-Thaxton et al., 2010). The concen- trations of lower in meat-type chick- ens stunned by hypobaric hypoxia than by electrical stunning (Vizzier-Thaxton et al., 2010). Reduced atmospheric pressure is an irreversible stun- ning technique when the final atmospheric pressure is 80.6 kPa after 4.67 min (Mackie and McKeegan, 2016). Within 1 min, the following behaviors are observed: mouth opening, head shaking, and open mouth breath- ing, together with ataxia (loss of control of bodily movements). Between 1 and 2 min, chickens exhibit markers of unconsciousness; namely, loss of posture and convulsions. Birds are motionless after 200 s (Mackie and McKeegan, 2016). As these behaviors were similar to those observed with controlled atmospheric systems, Mackie and McKeegan (2016) suggested that reduced atmospheric pressure stunning is a humane technique.

Specifically, commercial egg strains of chickens (white and brown egg layers and breeders) are discussed with reference to housing systems, feeding and watering, husbandry guidelines, standard production practices, and euthanasia. In addition, feeder, water, and floor space guidelines are presented. The physical environment provided in a poultry research or teaching facility should not put egg-type birds at undue risk of injury or expose them to condi- tions that would be likely to cause unnecessary distress, disease, or mortality (Tauson, 1985; Bell and Weaver, 2002; Appleby et al., 2004; Anderson et al., 2010). The facility must be maintained in a manner that minimizes stress, allows birds to perform species-specific behav- iors (e.g., roosting) and keep themselves clean and safe from predators and parasites, and prevents bird escape and entrapment and unnecessary accumulation of bird waste. Environmental conditions have major implications for the health, performance, and welfare of poultry (Stamp Dawkins et al., 2004). The thermal environment and air quality should be maintained by ventilation or cooling and heating systems to provide birds with the environ- mental conditions appropriate for their age and season of the year. In addition to bird well-being, caretaker welfare warrants consideration in evaluation of housing systems (Whyte, 1993), and both are very important concepts to follow during remodeling or development of future designs. Proper design of all housing systems is important in maintaining clean housing and equipment as well as inspecting birds. Cages with multiple decks must be designed to allow equipment cleaning and inspection of birds without handling, yet the birds should be easily accessible. Adequate lighting is needed for examination of all birds, and a movable platform or other system is necessary for examination of higher tiers if those can- not be readily seen by attendants standing on the floor. Accessibility of feeding and watering equipment is im- portant for easy maintenance.FACILITIES AND ENVIRONMENT Advantages and Disadvantages of Conventional and Alternative Housing Systems Although a variety of systems, including convention- al and furnished cages, aviaries, cage-free floor systems (litter or slat floor), and free range, can be used for housing laying hens and layer breeders, no housing sys- tem is perfect, with each having its own health and welfare advantages and disadvantages. No housing or management system is likely to be ideal in all respects. Therefore, ethically acceptable levels of welfare can exist in a variety of housing systems (Duncan, 1978). For a colored schematic of the welfare risks of different housing systems for egg-laying strains of chickens, see Table 7.7 of the LayWel report (LayWel, 2006b). Conventional Cages Conventional cages lack nests, perches, and dust baths to meet the behavioral needs of hens, but conven- tionally caged hens have less cannibalism and pecking because of smaller group sizes (Appleby and Hughes, 1991; Abrahamsson and Tauson, 1995), leading to re- duced mortality compared with hens in non-cage sys- tems Christensen, 2009; Fossum et al., 2009). Because conventional cages lack perches and do not have access to litter, poor foot health and keel bone deviations and deformities are less of a problem in cages than in non- cage systems or enriched colony cages (Tauson et al., 2006; Regmi et al., 2016b); however, because of lack of exercise, conventionally caged hens are susceptible to osteoporosis (Whitehead and Fleming, 2000; Jendral et al., 2008). Alternative Housing Research into alternative housing systems has been extensive in recent years (Appleby et al., 2004; et al., 2009; Tactacan et al., 2009; Golden et al., 2012; Guinebreti\u00e8re et al., 2013; Ali et al., 2016; Blatchford et al., 2016; Campbell et al., al., 2016a,b; Yilmaz et al., 2016); enriched colony cages, aviaries, and free-range systems are alternatives to conventional cages for egg- laying strains of chickens. Enriched Colony Cages. Enriched colony cages can house large (~60 hens), medium (15 to 30 hens), and small (up to 15 hens) group sizes. In these systems, claw-shortening devices are helpful to maintain short claws, and perches can help to increase leg strength (Hughes and Appleby, 1989; Jendral et al., 2008). Prob- lems have been observed in this type of housing, includ- ing increased keel bone deformities associated with high perch use (Vits et al., 2005; Tauson et al., 2006) and mortality (Anderson, 2015a). Floor Systems, Aviaries, and Multi-Tier Systems. In- door floor systems are sometimes referred to as barn systems or free-roaming systems. The hens have access to litter, slats, or litter and slats, and can roam in the building, pen, or open area, in a poultry house. They have unlimited access to fresh feed and water, while the litter allows for forage behavior. Cage-free systems used for laying hens vary in design, but all systems allow for common handling and care practices. They all provide adequate floor space, nest space, and perches. Depend- ing on the facility, these housing systems may or may not have an automated egg collection system (Ander- son, 2018). Aviaries, designed to use vertical space, consist of a ground floor plus one or more tiers hav- ing perforated, slatted floors, or platforms with manure belts underneath each elevated level (Appleby et al., 2004; LayWel, 2006a). Providing a littered area allows for dust bathing and reduces the incidence of cannibal- ism and feather pecking. The scratch area is abrasive, which helps hens maintain a normal claw length. The litter covering the floor area allows for proper mixing of manure, which will help prevent excessive manure and moisture accumulation. The depth of the litter should be sufficient to prevent hens from coming in contact with the floor. In contrast, deep litter is not recom- mended because it encourages the laying of eggs on the floor. Opening and closing the littered areas for specified periods can be used as a management tool to prevent the laying of floor eggs. Stratmann et al. (2015b) postulated that falls and collisions by hens housed in aviaries is associated with increased keel bone fractures. In addition, previous findings by Scott et al. (1997) documented that long distances and steep angles between tiers are more likely to result in unsuccessful jumps. Therefore, each tier should be positioned close enough to allow hens to safely access other vertical tiers, including the littered floor. For example, a ramp can be used to allow birds to move from the littered floor area to the first raised tier (Heerkens et al., 2016a). If ramps are used, they are designed to prevent droppings from falling on the birds below. Hens should have access to the entire lit- tered floor area. Additionally, the area under the raised tiers could be closed off to help eliminate the laying of floor eggs. Raised tiers need a belt system for frequent removal of manure. It is recommended that the vertical distance between tiers, including the floor to the first tier, be between 0.5 and 1.0 m (1.6 and 3.3 ft). Measurements may be taken from the top of the littered floor or slat area to the underside of the manure belt. When adjacent tiers are staggered to allow for diagonal access to tiers of different heights, the hen's angle of descent (measured horizontally from the top tier) should not exceed 45\u00b0. The horizontal distance between tiers should not be more than 0.8 m (2.6 ft). Where the design discourages horizontal movement between tiers, the minimum dis- tance between tiers should be 2 m (6.6 ft). Birds that are to be housed in aviaries as adults adapt better if they are reared as pullets in similar aviaries to facilitate adaptation to perches and nests (Janczak and Riber, 2015). Typically, day-old chicks are housed in a central tier for the first 10 d of age; then, about half of the pullets can be distributed to the lower tier to provide more space as they age. In this manner, the pullets quickly find feed and water and are provided proper brooding temperatures during the early stages of growth. By 15 to 21 d of age, pullets are given full access to the aviary. Ramps are provided to allow pul- lets easy access to all levels of the aviary. Perch space per pullet is recommended to be 8 cm (3.1 in)/pullet during the first 10 wk of age and 11 cm (4.3 in)/pullet after 10 wk of age. Welfare standards for pullet aviaries are still in the investigational stage. Since the early 2000s, with the increased interest in alternative housing systems for laying hens, a concerted effort has been made to develop research comparing various housing systems relative to the well-being and health of hens kept in commercial facilities. One study funded by the American Egg Board in 2008 formed a team of scientists to review the sustainability aspects of different hen housing systems. In 2010, the Coali- tion for a Sustainable Egg Supply (CSES) was formed, which consisted of university and USDA-Agricultural Research Service (ARS) poultry scientists (Swanson et al., 2015). They coordinated a 2-year study of commer- cial egg production systems (Zhao et al., 2015), exam- ining 5 different sustainability areas, one of which was health and well-being of laying hens. Several research papers have been published documenting the health and well-being responses of laying hens maintained in conventional cages, enriched colony cages, and a cage- free aviary. The CSES reported that cumulative hen mortality in the aviary system was twice that of hens in the con- ventional cage and enriched colony cage systems. The enriched colony cage and aviary systems offered hens 178 CHAPTER 12: EGG-TYPE POULTRY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020more behavioral freedom than the conventional cage system. Hens in the enriched colony cages had more keel abnormalities than hens in the conventional cages. During the egg production period, hens in the aviary system had more keel bone damage than those in the conventional cage system (Blatchford et al., 2016). Hens in the enriched colony cages had slightly less feather loss than those in the conventional cages, whereas hens in the aviary had the best feathering (Blatchford et al., 2016). These results suggest that hens in the aviary and enriched colony cages had more freedom of movement than hens in the conventional cages, but at the expense of greater mortality in the aviary system. Outdoor Access or Free Range. Egg-laying strains of chickens are also raised with access to the outdoors. Hens raised under an organic protocol require outdoor access (USDA Agricultural Marketing Service, 2001), which can be a range (paddock) or a semi-enclosed yard, often referred to as a veranda or winter garden. During inclement weather or for health-related reasons, birds should remain indoors or in shelters until such conditions are improved. A range (paddock) is an outside fenced area. Ad- equate fence height and fencing material of appropriate mesh size are necessary to retain domesticated poultry and prevent predator entry. Overhead fine netting, as used for game birds, can be used to protect domes- tic poultry from avian predators and minimize disease transmission from wild species to domesticated poul- try. Ranges should be free of debris such as large rocks and fallen trees and environmental contaminants, and they should be designed to prevent muddy areas, to avoid injuries and foot problems, and to promote over- all bird health. Vegetation should be used for ranges (paddocks) or sections of the range where soil erosion is problematic. Range rotation is one tool to minimize the risk of disease and parasites and to provide op- portunities for land and forages to recover from bird activity. A covered veranda provides shade and out- door access; it can be connected to the house and made available to hens during daylight hours. The floor of the veranda can be solid and may be covered with lit- ter. To minimize the probability of cannibalism, natural light or high-intensity artificial light can be used during the early stages of rearing to facilitate the transition of birds from indoor to outdoor lighting conditions. Free-range birds are able to express behaviors such as freedom of movement, running, short-distance flying, and the scratching of soil, and have the opportunity to be exposed to a variety of environmental stimuli (Ap- pleby and Hughes, 1991). Free-range birds are leaner with a greater percentage of muscle mass and plumage than caged birds (Hughes and Dun, 1986). However, birds on range are more susceptible to problems caused by inclement weather and have increased risks of bacte- rial disease, parasites, and cannibalism (Fossum et al., 2009) due to larger group sizes (Appleby et al., 1992), predation (Darre, 2003), environmental contaminants such as dioxin (Schoeters and Hoogenboom, 2006; Kijl-stra et al., 2007), increased frequency of old bone frac- tures (Gregory et al., 1990; Regmi et al., 2016a), and a higher incidence of foot pad lesions (Yilmaz Dikmen et al., 2016). Free-range birds without access to a permanent building usually have covered shelters that provide shade, protection from inclement weather, litter, food, and water. The sheltered area provides space to allow all ranged birds to rest together without risk of heat stress. Mobile shelters are moved on a regular basis or managed to minimize the probability of a disease out- break or muddy conditions. Elevated perches designed for poultry can be provided on the range or under the shelter. See the Perches section under Husbandry for more details. All range, veranda, or any other type of outdoor ac- cess is managed so that birds are protected from po- tential predators. Weather permitting, birds should be given access to the outside as soon as they have full feather coverage to encourage foraging behavior (An- derson, 2014). Egg-laying strains of chickens are al- lowed access to the range (paddock) at approximately 12 wk of age (Anderson, 2014). Vegetation such as small bushes, crops such as corn, or cover panels (Cornetto and Est\u00e9vez, 2001a) that provide a sense of protection in the outdoor area can be used to encourage use of the range (Nicol et al., 2003; Hegelund et al., 2005; Zeltner and Hirt, 2008). When indoor birds are allowed free access to the out- doors, popholes (openings) of sufficient number are in- stalled to facilitate egress of birds from and entrance into the building; alternatively, the doors of the house can be opened to allow birds freedom of movement. The size of each pophole allows for easy passage of a bird to and from the outside. The number of popholes provided should allow birds to comfortably access the outside or inside without significant congregations of birds on either side of the pophole. A roof can be placed over a pophole to provide protection, and baffles can be installed to reduce entry of wind into the house. Slats can also be used to prevent the formation of muddy areas around the popholes (LayWel, 2006a). For whole-house configurations without individual pens, popholes should be evenly distributed down the length of the building to prevent birds from blocking access in and out of the building. On windy days, it may be wise to open popholes only on the leeward side, so providing more than the minimum number of po- pholes is advisable. FEED AND WATER Feed Circular or linear troughs can be used to supply feed. Feed troughs can be located either inside or outside the area where the birds are housed. If feed troughs are located outside the area where birds are housed (as is the case for most adult cages), then only one side of 179 CHAPTER 12: EGG-TYPE POULTRY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020the trough is available to the birds. Unless the feeder is mounted on a wall, feeders located in the area where the birds are housed generally provide bird access to both sides of the trough. Minimum feeder space for egg-laying strains of chickens is shown in Table 12-1. Depending on strain, specifications are for birds housed in multiple-bird pens and cages, individual cages, or aviaries. Feeder space allocation is presented in the ta- ble as linear trough space per bird when both sides of the trough are available. If only one side of the trough is available, then the amount of feeder space per bird must be doubled. Feed should be allocated and body weight (BW) rou- tinely monitored to maintain the recommended BW for the particular stock and age. Anderson and Adams (1992, 1994) found that rearing feeder space from 2.7 to 5.4 cm/pullet (1.1 to 2.1 in/pullet) in white egg layers had no effect on growth, fearfulness, or tibia strength at 18 wk of age. There were no carryover effects on production in the laying phase. Anderson et al. (1995) showed that laying-house feeder space had no effect on sexual maturity, feed consumption, or hen-day egg pro- duction of the hens. It has been shown that if feeder space is limited, subordinate birds may be inhibited from feeding (Cunningham and van Tienhoven, 1984). In addition, Webster and Hurnik (1994) demonstrated that hens in cages prefer to feed synchronously. When greater feeder space is provided, this may reduce any negative effects of aggressive behaviors and social dom- inance during feeding. Thogerson et al. (2009a,b) con- ducted a 12-mo experiment to test the effects of vary-ing feeder space on laying hen productivity, physiology, and behavior. In that study, Hy-Line W-36 hens were maintained at 5.8, 7.1, 8.4, 9.7, 10.9, or 12.2 cm of feeder space per hen. No effects of varying feeder space allowance were found on egg production, bone mineral density, heterophil:lymphocyte ratios, or organ weights. These findings were substantiated by the work of An- derson and Jenkins (2011), which showed that feeder space of 10.2 or 13.6 cm/hen (using one side of the feed trough) independent of population or density resulted in the same productivity. They did find that as feeder space increased, feed consumption also increased. This resulted in poorer feed conversion for hens provided greater feeder space allowance. In addition, almost no aggressive behaviors were observed between hens when feeder space was reduced. These results demonstrated that hens did not aggressively exclude cage mates from the feeder but did desynchronize their feeding behavior. Therefore, the study documented that sufficient feeder space needs to be provided for hens in conventional cag- es so that they can eat synchronously. If feeder space is reduced, it does not increase aggressive activity or oth- er behavior problems. However, more recent research has shown that feeder space is linked to aggression in other housing systems (enriched cages: Widowski et al., 2017; aviaries: Sirovnik et al., 2018). Water Space allocations for waterers vary widely depend- ing on species, type of bird (Siegel, 1974), bird den-Table 12-1.

Specifications for feeder space for single bird cages are the same as multiple bird cages. 2Linear trough space assumes both sides of the trough are available. If only one side of the trough is available, double the amount of feeder space/bird. Perimeter space for round feeders is obtained by doubling the linear trough space/bird and multiplying the result by 0.8. 3Feeder space for mini-Leghorns (small-bodied, purebred birds) can be reduced by 10%. 4During the first week, supplementary feed should be placed on some type of temporary feeders (such as egg flats) on the cage, pen, or aviary floor. 5A pen is considered an enclosure having a litter floor/ground substrate. The arrangement of the feeders and wa- terers/water line(s) will influence the feeder space allocation. 6Feeder space for White Leghorn and Brown Leghorn breeders is the same as that for commercial layers except for pens in which 5.35 cm (2.1 in) and 6.16 cm (2.42 in), respectively, is provided to mature breeders after 18 wk of age. Male and female breeders are housed together for natural mating.180 CHAPTER 12: EGG-TYPE POULTRY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020sity, and whether water intake is restricted. Anderson et al. (2004) documented that the frequency of drinking behavior of hens housed at 361 and 482 cm2/bird re- mained relatively constant throughout a production pe- riod, with no negative interactions at the nipple drink- ers. Minimum watering space for egg-laying strains of chickens is shown in Table 12-2. Specifications are for multiple-bird pens and cages, individual cages, and avi- aries. These space allocations assume moderate ambi- ent temperatures. Newly hatched birds may have difficulty obtaining water initially unless they can find the waterers eas- ily. Similar difficulties can occur when older birds are moved to a new environment, especially if the type of watering device differs from that used previously by the birds. Watering cups that require birds to press a lever or other releasing mechanism require operant con- ditioning. Because individuals may fail to operate the releasing mechanism by spontaneous trial and error, shaping of the behavior may be required, for example, by pressing the individual bird's beak or bill to the trig- ger to release the water. Watering cups may need to be filled manually for several days (or weeks in some cases) until the birds have learned the process. Water pres- sure is regulated carefully with some automatic devices and watering cups. In such cases, pressure regulators and pressure meters are located close to the levels at which water is being delivered. Manufacturer recom- mendations are used initially and adjusted if necessary to obtain optimal results. Automatic watering devices require frequent inspection to avoid malfunctions that can result in flooding or stoppage. Waterers are exam- ined at least once per day to ensure they are in good working condition. The height of drinkers should be adjusted to meet bird size. Birds accessing nipple drink- ers will raise their heads up while standing to activate the trigger pins (Bell and Weaver, 2002). As a general guide, it is recommended that the bottom of the nipple drinker be positioned at the head level of the bird so it can activate the trigger pin to access the water. Egg-laying strains of chickens must have continuous access to clean drinking water. Water must be provided daily and made available when feed is being consumed. Adequate drinker space is needed to prevent undue competition at the drinkers. Water may also be shut off temporarily in preparation for administration of vac- cines or medications in the water. HUSBANDRY Social Environment Egg-laying strains of chickens are highly social and are maintained in stable groups when possible. Some management practices should be avoided. For exam- ple, repeated mixing of individuals from one socially organized flock to another may induce stress in those individuals that are moved (Gross and Siegel, 1985). Human interactions with chickens can also contribute, favorably or unfavorably, to the social environment of the animal (Gross and Siegel, 1982; Bryan Jones, 1994). A calm, friendly interaction between familiar animal caretakers and the birds will result in reduced stress and better performance compared with abrupt, careless interactions. Human-poultry interactions are discussed in more detail in Chapter 4: Environmental Enrich- ment. Egg-laying strains of chickens are likely to panic when sudden changes in their environment occur (e.g., a wild bird flying overhead, loud noises to which the birds are not habituated, or an abrupt, rapid, or careless human interaction). When birds are kept in group housing, Table 12-2.

Proper hus- bandry methods are important to prevent injury and death loss caused by smothering. Such sudden changes in management practices should be prevented to the extent possible. Ideally, young birds, which are less re- active to such stimuli, should be habituated to condi- tions that are likely to be encountered and that could cause panic responses later in life. Producers report that providing grit or feed on litter to encourage forag- ing behavior, blocking off corners, and walking pens and barns frequently may reduce smothering (Barrett et al., 2014; Rayner et al., 2016). Excessive fighting may occur in both multiple-bird cages and alternative systems with moderate density (Craig and Polley, 1977) or in mixed-sex flocks. The proportion of mature males in sexually mature breeder flocks should be low enough to prevent injury to fe- males from excessive mounting. Male to female ratios for breeding purposes can vary for different breeds and strains of chickens. The optimal ratio in most layer breeder flocks is 1 male to 12 to 15 females. Some en- vironmental enrichment techniques can be used to con- trol aggression and over-mating in poultry (Est\u00e9vez, 1999; Cornetto et al., 2002). Recent research, however, has shown that social dy- namics in layers are complex and increments in group size or density do not necessarily result in a linear in- crease in aggression or reduced welfare and performance (Est\u00e9vez et al., 2003, 2007). Currently, beak trimming is allowed for preventing or reducing injurious peck- ing and cannibalism (see Beak Trimming section). In addition, according to AVMA policy, beak trimming of poultry should be practiced only when necessary to prevent feather pecking and cannibalism. Intermedi- ate group sizes of around 30 birds have been found to be more problematic than smaller (15) or larger (60 to 120) groups of layers in floor pens (Keeling et al., 2003). More recent research on furnished (enriched) cages indicates no effect of group size in cages housing 8, 10, 20, 40, or 60 hens at 750 cm2/hen (116.2 in2/hen) on either production or mortality (Weitzenb\u00fcrger et al., 2005; Huneau-Sala\u00fcn et al., 2011; Wall, 2011). Floor Area and Space Utilization Egg-laying strains of chickens should have sufficient freedom of movement to be able to turn around, get up, lie down, groom themselves, stretch their wings, wing flap, and express their normal behaviors (Bram- bell, 1965). Space per bird for key resources including feeders, water drinkers, perches, and nests should be considered specifically. Use of floor area by birds with- in groups follows a diurnal pattern and is influenced by the dimensions and design of the facilities. Birds may huddle together for shared warmth or spread out for heat dissipation (Guo et al., 2012). They generally use less area during resting and grooming than during more active periods and may seek the protection of- fered by the walls of the enclosure, although all areas of a pen are typically used (Keeling, 1994; Cornetto and Est\u00e9vez, 2001b; Campbell et al., 2016a). Hens also tend to cluster around resources, such as feeders, resulting in high density in some areas of a cage or pen (Channing et al., 2001; Collins et al., 2011). Spatial distribution of hens has been observed to vary considerably over time, ranging from 9 to 41 hens/m2 in groups housed at a constant density of 18.5 birds/m2 (Channing et al., 2001); these variations in spatial distribution could be greatest for larger flocks (Channing et al., 2001). The amount of space physically occupied by a hen when performing different behaviors or different pos- tures, is strain-dependent. Ross hybrid hens used 540 to 1,006 cm2/hen (83.7 to 115.9 in2/hen) (101.2 to when stretch- to 1,005 cm2/hen (83.7 to 155.8 in2/ hen) when scratching the ground (Stamp Dawkins and Hardie, 1989). White light-hybrids used an average in2/hen) flapping; and hens in flocks of 60 indi- viduals or greater are predicted to need approximately 600 cm2 (93 in2) of space to perform both static pos- tures and dynamic behaviors (Mench and Blatchford, 2014). Minimum floor areas for multiple-bird pens, con- ventional and enriched cages, individually housed birds, and aviaries are given in Table 12-3. Floor space allowances for layer-type chickens in con- ventional cages are based on extensive research. In a survey of experiments involving density effects (mostly White Leghorn hens), Adams and Craig (1985) made multiple comparisons within specific categories for sev- eral production traits and for livability. Their survey indicated that livability and hen-housed egg produc- tion were reduced significantly when areas of 387 cm2 (60 in2) and 310 cm2 (48 in2) were compared with 516 cm2 (80 in2), amounting to reductions of 2.8 and 5.3% in livability and 7.8 and 15.8 eggs per hen housed, re- spectively. Decreases in livability, production measures, and well-being were also associated with high density. Craig et al. (1986a,b) found that livability and egg mass were significantly lower with 310 cm2 (48 in2) than with 464 cm2 (72 in2); Okpokho et al. (1987) and Craig and Mil- liken (1989) found livability was lower at 348 cm2 (54 in2) than at 464 cm2 (72 in2) and 580 cm2 (90 in2); and Craig and Milliken (1989) found lower hen-day rate of lay and egg mass per hen at the highest density. In the same studies, however, no differences in survival and egg production measures were detected between the 2 lower densities (i.e., higher space allowances). From data on plasma corticosterone concentrations, Mashaly et al. (1984) concluded that more than 387 cm2 (60 in2) of space per hen should be provided; Craig et al. 182 CHAPTER 12: EGG-TYPE POULTRY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020(1986a,b) found that plasma corticosterone concentra- tions were greater at 310 cm2 (48 in2) than at 464 cm2 (72 in2). Similarly, feather condition was worse (Craig et al., 1986a,b) and fearfulness was greater at 310 cm2/ hen (48 in2) when estimated at 40 wk of age or older (Okpokho et al., 1987; Craig and Milliken, 1989). Using data on egg production, mortality, and serum corticos- terone concentrations, Roush et al. (1989) concluded that 3 hens, rather than 4, should be kept in cages of 1,549 cm2 (240 in2) area; that is, within the goals and constraints used, hens should have 516 cm2 (80 in2) rather than 387 cm2 (60 in2) area. Using operant determination for laying hens' preference for cage size, Faure (1986) indicated that a stocking density of 400 cm2 (62 in2) was sufficient most of the time, although hens would work to obtain more space (up to 6,000 cm2 or 930 in2) up to 25% of the day. Modification of commercial cages from those current- ly in wide usage for chickens may improve the health and welfare of birds (Tauson, 1995). Thus, cage height should allow birds to stand comfortably without hitting their heads on the top of the cages. Studies have indi- cated at least 40 cm (15.7 in) over 65% of the cage area and not less than 35 cm (13.8 in) at any point is de- sirable (Harner and Wilson, 1985; Nicol, 1987). Taller cages may be necessary for larger breeds. Cage floors with a slope of no more than 9\u00b0 in shallow, reversed cages may result in better foot health (Tauson, 1981). However, such low slopes may not be desirable in deep- er cages, because difficulties are encountered in getting eggs to roll out efficiently (Elson and Overfield, 1976). Horizontal bars across the front of the cage appear to allow egg-laying strains of chickens to feed easily and with reduced probability of entrapment (Tauson, 1985). White Leghorn hens housed in cages with horizontal cage fronts had better feather scores than hens housed in cages with vertical bar fronts (Anderson and Adams, 1991); however, a comparison between hens in enriched colony cages and conventional cages with horizontally barred fronts and aviary-housed hens showed feather abrasion in the caged hens (Blatchford et al., 2016). The cage door needs to be wide enough to allow easy removal of the bird. Caged hens may cease egg production temporarily or birds may undergo a molt if removed from the cages to which they have become accustomed; for example, during cage cleaning (Anderson et al., 2010). Therefore, hens and roosters may be kept in their cages for 18 mo or longer, as long as air cleanliness is maintained and excreta are disposed of regularly from under the cages. However, the incidence of osteoporosis and weak bones may be higher in hens caged for prolonged periods than in hens housed in systems where greater freedom of movement is possible (Knowles and Broom, 1990). Singly caged birds are frequently used in agricultural research and teaching to establish or demonstrate fun- damental principles and techniques. Because within- cage competition for feed and water is absent, feeding and watering space allowances are not critical; how- ever, individually caged birds must have ready access to sources of feed and water. Minimum floor areas for birds with outdoor access are presented in Table 12-4. Table 12-3.

The floor area is defined as being composed of the litter area, raised plastic slats, including elevated areas. After 18 wk of age, provide 1,858 cm2 (288 in2) and 2,137 cm2 (331 in2) for litter pens with or without raised plastic slats, and 1,625 cm2 (252 in2) and 1,869 cm2 (290 in2), respectively, S&L or W&L to Leghorn and Brown Leghorn breeders, respectively.183 CHAPTER 12: EGG-TYPE POULTRY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020Before 12 wk of age, hens are brooded in confinement. If the outdoor space is to be subdivided, the rotation pattern depends on the geographic location of the facil- ities; however, in most temperate regions, a 28-d rota- tion program will allow for a 50% forage cover that pro- vides 2.8 m2/hen (30 ft2/hen; Anderson, 2015b). Shade should be evenly distributed in the outdoor area and provided at a minimum of 8 m2 (86 ft2) per 1,000 hens. Flooring Egg-laying strains of chickens may be kept either on solid floors with litter or in cages or pens with raised wire floors of appropriate gauge and mesh dimension. When poultry reside on solid floors, litter provides a cushion during motor activity and resting and absorbs water from droppings. The ideal litter can absorb large quantities of water and evaporate it quickly to promote rapid drying. A dry, dusty litter or a litter that is too wet will have a negative effect on the health, welfare, and performance of poultry. When sampled away from drinkers, litter should hold some moisture but not be so moist that it forms into a ball that resists crum- bling when compressed in the hands. Litter should not emit excessive dust when disturbed. The poultry house needs to be ventilated to maintain litter in a slightly moist condition. Avoiding excess moisture in the litter improves bird health by reducing dirty foot pads, hock lesions, leg defects, and fecal corticosterone (Stamp Dawkins et al., 2004). Some examples of acceptable materials used for litter, depending on local availability, include rice hulls, peanut hulls, straw, wood sawdust or shavings, cane bagasse, and chopped Miscanthus gigan- teus grass. In some aviary systems with floor litter ar- eas, producers will initially not place litter material on the floor but rely on accumulation of feed, feathers, and manure. Because litter materials differ in their ability to absorb and release water, husbandry practices may be varied to maintain proper litter conditions. Litter material being stored for future use is usually kept dry to retard mold growth. When poultry are kept in cages or on raised floors, accumulated droppings must not reach the birds. Droppings are to be removed at inter-vals frequent enough to keep ammonia (NH 3) and odors to a minimum. Experimental work has shown that hens will avoid ammonia concentrations of 20 to 25 ppm (Kristensen et al., 2000; Jones et al., 2005). Perches Egg-laying strains of chickens housed in cage-free systems instinctively use perches at night (Olsson and Keeling, 2002). An entire flock (100%) will use perches at night if sufficient roosting space is provided (Ap- pleby et al., 1993; Olsson and Keeling, 2000). Perches allow hens to roost comfortably with a minimum of dis- turbance and provide an opportunity for hens to seek refuge from aggressive birds and thus avoid cannibalis- tic pecking (Wechsler and Huber-Eicher, 1998). Early exposure to perches during rearing encourages adult perching behavior (Faure and Bryan Jones, 1982a), and the presence of perches leads to a lower incidence of floor eggs (Appleby et al., 1983) and reduces stress in birds (Campo et al., 2005). However, if perches are not designed properly, they can lead to keel bone deformi- ties (Tauson et al., 2006) and a high level of keel bone fractures; more fractures are observed in systems with high perches (86%, Wilkins et al., 2011). Hens reared with perches develop better ability to move around in 3-dimensional space, which could reduce later keel damage (Gunnarsson et al., 2000), and hens that start to perch early in life may use perches more for night- time roosting as adults (Heikkil\u00e4 et al., 2006). Perches are designed to allow hens to wrap their toes around the perch and balance themselves evenly on the perch in a relaxed posture for an extended period. Perches made of or covered with softer materials such as polyurethane can reduce the number of keel bone fractures and deviations (Stratmann et al., 2015a). Perches should also be easy to clean and not provide hiding places for mites (Fiddes et al., 2005). Wooden perches harbor more mites than plastic but may lead to a lower incidence of leg problems (Tauson and Abra- hamsson, 1996). There is conflicting information about hens' preferences for different perch materials or the ef- fect of soiling of perches on perch attractiveness or slip- ping by hens (see Sandilands et al., 2009 for a review). Perch recommendations usually specify that perches be located high enough above the floor to allow hens to grasp the perch without trapping their claws be- tween the perch and the floor and to allow eggs to roll under, enabling collection of system-laid eggs (EFSA AHAW Panel, 2015). A minimum of 20% of the perch space should be elevated above the adjacent floor. The amount of space between the perch and the cage ceiling should be more than 20 cm (8 in) to improve perch use (Struelens et al., 2008a). The center of the upper surface of the perch should be flat to allow for weight distribution and minimize keel deformities and foot problems (Struelens and Tuyttens, 2009). Perch edges should be smooth and round. The perch is usu-Table 12-4.

(2017).184 CHAPTER 12: POULTRY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020ally made of nonslip material that can be thoroughly cleaned between flocks. The ideal location for perches is over slats or wire to prevent manure accumulation under the perches. Perch placement is important to minimize fecal contamination of birds, drinkers, and feeders below. Perches also need to be placed at a suf- ficient distance from the wall to allow birds to use the perch. Enough space should be provided to allow a bird to jump down from its perch at an angle no steeper than 45\u00b0. Ramps can also be provided between perches of different heights. Perches should be at least 30 cm (12 in) apart (horizontally) to minimize cannibalistic pecking between birds on parallel roosts. All birds need to be able to roost at the same time; therefore, a minimum of 15 cm (6 in) of usable lin- ear perch space per bird should be provided. However, offering 17 to 26 cm (6.7 to 10.2 in) of perch space per hen can increase the number of hens that perch simultaneously from 71 to 78% to 100% of the group (Duncan et al., 1992; Cook et al., 2011). Perforated floors that have perches incorporated into the floor structure and the rail in front of nest boxes can be counted as perch space. Thus, graspable edges of slat- ted or grid platforms or tiers that are at least 60 cm (24 in) from the ground could also be considered part of the perching allowance (Schrader and M\u00fcller, 2009; EFSA preference for grasp- ing while perching appears to be weaker than their preference for perch height (Schrader and M\u00fcller, 2009; Schrader et al., 2016). The arrangement of perches within a system can af- fect hens' ability to perch. Perches should be arranged in parallel configurations and separated as lower and higher perches (Wall and Tauson, 2007). The higher perch should be >60 cm (>24 in) above the ground for nighttime roosting because hens prefer to use higher perches at night. Up to 90% of hens in a flock have been observed roosting on top-level perches and tiers, using lower perches and tiers only as upper levels are filled (Abrahamsson and Tauson, 1995; Od\u00e9n et al., 2002). The height of the higher perch should not exceed 1 m (3.3 ft) above the floor to minimize skeletal fractures during bird flight from a perch. Hens will use ramps to move between tiers or perches, and provision of these can minimize keel bone injuries to hens from flying up to or jumping down from tall perches (Stratmann et al., 2015b; Heerkens et al., 2016a). There are differences in perch usage and preference between breeds that need to be considered when plac- ing hens into systems. White Leghorn type hens have been observed to prefer higher perches at night com- pared with brown hens in some studies, whereas the reverse is true for other strains; in some cases, no dif- ferences have been reported (Faure and Bryan Jones, 1982b; Wall and Tauson, 2007; Cook et al., 2011; Ali et al., 2016). A possible explanation for breed-related differences could be differences in wing load, making it more difficult for heavier hens to access higher perch-es (Moinard et al., 2004) or to control landings onto perches (Scholz et al., 2014). Nests Hens place a high value on accessing nests, and their motivation for nest use increases greatly as the time of oviposition approaches (Cooper and Albentosa, 2003). Hens without prior exposure to nests show strong mo- tivation to use nests for egg laying (Cooper and Ap- pleby, 1995, 1997). Nests facilitate egg collection and minimize the risk of cloacal cannibalism. Because eggs laid in nests are cleaner and more sanitary, every effort should be made to avoid floor eggs. Use of an electrical hot wire near walls outside the nests may discourage the laying of floor eggs, as may a bright light that elimi- nates shadows when directed toward the corner. Nests should be dark inside to lower the risk of canni- balism. Having nests that are properly constructed and maintained is important to protect hens from external parasites and disease organisms. Nests are closed to bird access at night and reopened before lay early in the morning. Regular inspection and cleaning of nests should be performed to ensure that there is no manure accumulation. Nest floors can be sloped to allow eggs to roll onto collection belts, and hens prefer slopes of 12% compared with 18% (St\u00e4mpfli et al., 2011). Nests should be provided with a suitable floor substrate (e.g., turf pads or wood shavings) that encourages nesting behavior (Hughes, 1993; Struelens et al., 2008b). It is best to avoid nests with wire floors or plastic-coated wire floors alone. The provision of loose litter material in nests can be useful for training hens to use nests. For individual nest boxes with a single opening, a minimum of 1 nest box per 8 birds should be provided. Nest box size for individual hens of egg-laying strains, which includes table-egg producers and layer breeders, can be 30 cm wide by 30 cm deep by 36 cm high (12 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 14 in). For colony nests, a minimum of 0.8 m2 (9 ft2) of nest space per 100 hens should be provided. Hot- ter climates may require more nest space. Pullets intended for systems with nests adapt better if they are reared with access to raised areas and perches from an early age to become adept at moving up and down in space. Pullets allowed to access perches during rearing are less likely to lay floor eggs during the laying period (Appleby et al., 1983). However, pullets reared in aviaries and then placed in enriched colony cages may find the nests in cages less attractive than pullets reared in standard cages (Hunniford and Widowski, 2016). Birds transferred to the layer house before sexual matu- rity need to be allowed sufficient time for exploration of the house and to find the nests before onset of lay. Crowding in nests may increase the risk of heat stress and smothering (Riber, 2010), or scratches, wounds, and feather loss from birds climbing on top of each other (Appleby and Smith, 1991). Several factors may result in overcrowding of nest areas, including the at-185 CHAPTER 12: EGG-TYPE POULTRY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020tractiveness of the artificial nest compared with other areas of the cage (Appleby et al., 1985), internal cir- cadian rhythms of hens that result in most egg laying occurring during morning hours (Boz et al., 2014), pref- erence of hens for nests in specific locations (Lentfer et al., 2013; Riber and Nielsen, 2013), and gregarious nesting behavior, whereby the presence of other hens in a nest makes it more attractive for hens searching for a location to lay (Riber, 2010, 2012). Insufficient space for simultaneous use of the nest by all hens may pre- vent hens from performing pre-lay behaviors and ovi- position in a preferred location and can result in litter or system-laid eggs by individuals unable to access the nest (Kruschwitz et al., 2008). There is also evidence of competition among hens in enriched colony cages for access to nests (Hunniford et al., 2014), suggesting that using the location of eggs laid as a measure of nest space or appropriate design is not sufficient. Further comparative studies involving observation of nest box activity, aggression and displacement behavior (Od\u00e9n et al., 2002), pre-lay behaviors of hens laying outside the nest box (Cronin et al., 2005), and tracking of eggs laid by individual hens would be beneficial to determine the role of pre-lay behaviors in egg lay pat- tern discrepancies between strains. Incubation and Hatching The incubation and hatching process for eggs from egg-type breeders is similar to that discussed in Chapter 11: Meat-Type Poultry . As stated in that chapter, fac- tors that contribute to successful incubation and hatch- ing of eggs include egg characteristics, egg cleanliness, egg storage, incubator and hatcher temperatures and humidity, and egg turning. When assessing egg quality and cleanliness, it is important to set eggs that are of sound shell texture, not cracked or damaged, and have a clean exterior shell. If fertile eggs are to be stored for any length of time they should be placed in incubation trays with the small (pointed) end of the egg facing down and stored in a cooler or cool room until pickup for the hatchery. Eggs from a collection period (morn- ing and afternoon) should be stored at 15 to 18\u00b0C (59 to 64.4\u00b0F) with a relative humidity of 70 to 80% (Hy- Line International, 2020). When necessary to save eggs longer than 10 d, store at 13\u00b0C (55.4\u00b0F) with 70 to 80% relative humidity. Eggs can be stored for up to 7 to 8 d before hatchability decreases. After storage for 10 d, there is a marked decrease in hatchability. Incuba- tion of eggs during the setting phase (days 1 to 18/19) requires temperature and humidity of 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F) and 65% relative humidity, respectively. During the last 2 to 3 d in the hatcher, the temperature should be low- ered to 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F) and relative humidity increased to 70%. When eggs are transferred from the setter to the hatcher, they should be carefully moved and laid down flat in the hatcher trays. At this time (d 18/19), the ventilation and relative humidity in the hatcher are increased because embryos need extra moisture to be able to hatch. In addition, metabolic heat and the need for oxygen increase when chicks start to hatch. Follow- ing hatching (d 21), the chicks are carefully moved to a chick holding room for chick processing (beak treat- ment, vaccine administration). Brooding Temperature and Ventilation Because thermoregulatory mechanisms are poorly de- veloped in young egg-laying chicks, supplemental heat is required during the brooding period. Requirements of young birds may be met by a variety of brooding environments (e.g., floor pen housing with hovers or radiant heaters distributed in localized areas, battery brooders, and cage or pen units in heated rooms). Ventilation is generally increased gradually over the first few weeks of the brooding period. Whether venti- lation is provided by a mechanical system or involves natural airflow, drafts should be avoided and streams of air that impinge upon portions of pens or groups of cages should be minimized. In relatively open brooding facilities, such as in houses having windows for ventila- tion and with chicks kept in floor pens, draft shields may be beneficial for up to 10 d after hatching. Young birds may huddle together or cluster when sleeping but are likely to disperse when awake. Within limits, birds can maintain appropriate body tempera- tures by moving away from or toward sources of heat when possible and by avoiding or seeking contact with other individuals. Extreme huddling of young birds di- rectly under the source of heat, especially during waking hours, usually indicates the need for more supplemental heat; dispersal associated with panting indicates that the environment is too warm. With brooding systems that allow birds to move to- ward or away from heat sources (cool room brooding), the temperature outside the brooding area is main- tained at 20 to 25\u00b0C (68 to 77\u00b0F) during the first few weeks but should not be so high as to cause young birds to pant or show other signs of hyperthermy. When the entire room (whole house) is heated and chicks are not free to move to cooler areas, the minimum temperatures recommended below may be too high. Thus, during the first week after hatching, a lower temperature (e.g., a few degrees below 32\u00b0C) may reduce the lethargy and non-responsiveness that is otherwise likely to be seen. Areas with minimum temperatures that are adequate for comfort and prevent chilling should be available to young birds. The following minimum temperatures un- der the brooder and weekly decreases are suggested un- til supplementary heat is no longer needed: Cool room for chicks: 32 to 35\u00b0C (90 to 95\u00b0F) am- bient temperature initially, decreasing by 2.5\u00b0C (4.5\u00b0F) weekly to 20\u00b0C (68\u00b0F); however, for some well-feathered strains, supplemental heat may be discontinued at 3 wk if room temperature is 22 to 24\u00b0C (72 to 75\u00b0F).186 CHAPTER 12: EGG-TYPE POULTRY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020 Whole house for chicks: 30 to 32\u00b0C (86 to 90\u00b0F) ambient temperature initially, decreasing by 2.5\u00b0C (4.5\u00b0F) weekly to 20\u00b0C (68\u00b0F); however, supple- mental heat may be discontinued at 3 wk if indi- cated by pullet behavior and room temperature is 22 to 24\u00b0C (72 to 75\u00b0F). Air Quality and Ventilation During Rearing and Laying Phases After the brooding phase, ventilation and indoor air quality are maintained to provide for bird comfort and optimal rearing and egg-laying performance. The pur- pose of good ventilation is to maintain proper indoor temperature, remove moisture (particularly during the winter), and keep ammonia and dust levels to a mini- mum. Several types of pullet rearing and laying situ- ations exist. Birds might be reared on a littered floor and then transferred to cages or kept in a cage-free facility with nest boxes. They might also be brooded and reared in cages and then transferred to cages or to a cage-free facility. Good air quality and adequate ventilation must al- ways be maintained in both cage-free and cage facili- ties. It is important to maintain proper house ventila- tion to avoid heat stress. Laying hens that are exposed to high environmental temperatures; that is, above 29.4\u00b0C (84.9\u00b0F), will decrease egg production and have poorer eggshell quality due to the thinning of shells that results when hens experience a \"respiratory alka- losis\" condition related to panting behavior. Panting is one means by which poultry thermoregulate. During extreme high temperatures and relative humidity, this condition may be unavoidable. Ventilation systems de- signed to avoid this problem are very important. In addition to the effects of heat stress on laying hen performance and welfare, it is critical to main- tain adequate poultry house ventilation to avoid the build-up of ammonia (NH 3) gases due to the degra- dation of nitrogenous compounds in poultry manure. Exposure to high levels of ammonia causes irritation of the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract and eyes, increasing susceptibility to respiratory diseases and corneal inflammation (Kristensen and Wathes, 2000; Aziz and Barnes, 2010). Birds detect and avoid atmospheric ammonia at or below 25 ppm (Kristensen et al., 2000). According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), exposure for humans must not exceed 5 ppm for an 8-h day; for short-term exposure of 15 min, the threshold is 35 ppm (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Regis- try, 2004). Ideally, ammonia exposure for birds should be less than 25 ppm, and it is recommended that lev- els not exceed 50 ppm for any considerable period (Lott and Donald, 2002).Lighting Light is an important aspect of a laying hen's or breeder's environment. The various aspects of light quality\u2014wavelength (i.e., the color of light), intensity, and duration\u2014are important to achieve proper pul- let growth and to stimulate production. Research has shown that the color of light has many different effects on behavior, growth, and reproduction in poultry. Birds sense light through their eyes (retinal photoreceptors) and through photosensitive cells in the brain (extra- retinal photoreceptors). It has been well documented that long wavelengths of light (toward the red end of the spectrum) penetrate the skin and skull more ef- ficiently than short wavelengths (the blue end of the spectrum). Growth and behavior are affected by short- er wavelengths of light, whereas production (egg lay- ing) is stimulated more by long wavelengths. Therefore, blue-green light stimulates growth and orange-red light stimulates reproduction. The color of light is important for stimulating egg production and is related to the chromaticity of light. Chromaticity is a measure of a light source's warmth (warm light) or coolness (cool light), and it is expressed in degrees kelvin (K). A chro- maticity value of light between 3000K and 3500K (a warm light) is preferred for stimulating production in layer breeders and laying hens. In addition, ultraviolet light can also have an effect on several responses in poultry. It has been shown that birds can perceive UVA light, which affects a variety of behaviors (Lewis and Gous, 2009), and UVB light affects vitamin D metabo- lism (de Matos, 2008), which could have a beneficial effect on egg quality and bone health. In research fa- cilities, incandescent bulbs, fluorescent lamps, or LED lamps can be used with success and provide the correct color of light. Another important lighting factor is light intensi- ty. Light should not be too bright after the first few days following hatch and during the laying period for breeders and laying hens. However, during the first few days after hatching, light intensity should be relatively bright to enable chicks to find feed and water. The third important aspect of lighting is the dura- tion of light (i.e., photoperiod). Two basic rules must be followed for optimum growth and production perfor- mance: (1) never increase the duration or intensity of light during the growing period, and (2) never decrease the duration or intensity of light during the egg produc- tion period. These rules apply to both layer breeders and laying hens. Many possible variations exist for the application of lighting programs to growing and laying birds that will not harm the birds. When the light environment can be controlled, the following guidelines promote optimum growth and production performance in laying hens and layer breeders. Pullet chicks need to have 20 to 22 h of 187 CHAPTER 12: EGG-TYPE POULTRY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020continuous light at 30 to 50 lx (2.8 to 4.6 foot-candles, fc) intensity during the first week of age. After the first week of age, light intensity can be reduced to 10 lx (0.9 fc) at the feeder. As far as day length (photoperiod) is concerned, the continuous light period should be reduced gradually to 8 to 12 h by 10 wk of age. If the pullets are grown in brown-out houses or open-sided houses, they need to be grown at a time of year when natural daylight is decreasing; if grown at other times of the year, artificial lighting should be applied so birds do not prematurely experience an increase in photoperiod. The light inten- sity in the growing period is usually kept the same as that used in the lay house. It is important to remember that light stimulation (i.e., an increase in photoperiod) should not be pro- vided until the flock has reached optimum BW. This is important because if hens are light stimulated before reaching optimum BW, there might be problems with a condition called prolapse. This is where the uterus (shell gland) of the hen has everted to the outside of the vent area and will not retract after the hen lays an egg. This could cause an unhealthy status for the hen and a possibility of pecking by other hens. Therefore, when target BW is reached (about 17 to 18 wk of age), day length can be increased from the growing photope- riod; that is, from 8 to 12 h/d to 14 to 17 h/d in 15- to 30-min increases per week. Additionally, the minimum light intensity needs to be 10 lx (0.9 fc), and intensities up to 30 to 40 lx (2.8 to 3.7 fc) are adequate. Higher in- tensities risk development of behavioral problems such as feather pecking and cannibalism. When layer breeder hens and laying hens are subject- ed to a molt program, day length may be decreased to encourage hens to cease laying eggs, and then increased to its original length when hens are brought back into production. Other factors to keep in mind when induc- ing a molt are discussed later in this chapter. When initiating an induced molt, day length is generally re- duced to 9 to 10 h per day at the start and kept at this level until hens begin to return to egg production around 3 wk later (Biggs et al., 2003, 2004; Mejia et al., 2010, 2011). This reduction in day length works best in enclosed, light-controlled houses, but it will also work in open-sided houses if done at the appropriate time of the year. STANDARD PRODUCTION PRACTICES For handling birds and for all practices described here, experienced and skilled persons should carry out or train and supervise those who carry out these pro- cedures. Beak Trimming Trimming the tip of the beak is done to minimize feather loss, injury or death due to feather pecking, ag- gression, and cannibalistic behavior. Outbreaks of can-nibalism among egg-laying strains of chickens can occur with any housing system, resulting in a serious welfare problem. If the trimmed beak grows back, a second trim may be needed. An alternative to beak trimming is the use of low light intensity in housing systems in which light control is feasible. Genetic stocks that show little tendency to- ward cannibalistic behavior and feather pecking should be used when possible (Hester and Shea-Moore, 2003; Lay et al., 2011). Use of enrichments to control canni- balism and feather pecking are discussed in Chapter 4: Environmental Enrichment. Production, behavior, and physiological measure- ments of stress (Glatz, 2005) and pain, as indicated by neural transmission in the trimmed beak (Gentle, 1989), are used as criteria to determine well-being in beak-trimmed birds. In addition, the welfare of those hens that are pecked by beak-intact hens has been eval- uated (Freire et al., 2003). Disadvantages of beak trim- ming include short-term stress (Davis et al., 2004) as well as short-term, and perhaps long-term, pain follow- ing trimming of the beak (Cheng, 2005; Kuenzel, 2007). Because a bird's feeding behavior is usually modified by a new beak shape, their efficiency in eating may be impaired following a trim. Welfare advantages of beak trimming include decreased mortality; reduced feather pulling, pecking, and cannibalism; better feather condi- tion; less chronic stress; and less fearfulness and ner- vousness. Welfare advantages are more applicable to the interactive flock, whereas welfare disadvantages are applicable to individual birds whose beaks are trimmed (Hester and Shea-Moore, 2003). Genetic lines differ in their aggressiveness and beak-trimming requirements (Craig, 1992). Genetic selection can be effective in re- ducing or eliminating most feather-pecking and beak- inflicted injuries (Craig and Muir, 1993, 1996; Muir, 1996), and heritability estimates for survival suggest that prospects for improving livability through genetic selection are good (Ellen et al., 2008). Therefore, when feasible, stocks that require either minimal or no beak trimming should be used. Nevertheless, beak trimming is justified in stocks that are otherwise likely to suffer extensive feather-pecking and cannibalistic losses. Man- agement guides, available from most breeders, indicate methods for beak trimming to reduce these vices. The 2 acceptable methods of beak trimming are infrared beak treatment at the hatchery and hot-blade beak trimming at 6 to 10 d of age or younger (Hester and Shea-Moore, Riber (2015) provided an ex- haustive review of these beak trimming methods, and various circumstances would dictate when each method should be used. The amount of beak trimmed should be 50% or less to prevent neuroma formation and to allow the keratinized tissue to regenerate (Kuenzel, 2007). The length of the upper beak distal from the nostrils that remains following trimming needs to be 2 to 3 mm (0.08 to 0.12 in). The lower beak should be slightly longer than the upper beak. If a second trim is needed 188 CHAPTER 12: EGG-TYPE POULTRY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020due to regrowth of the beak, it is best done before the pullets are 8 wk of age to avoid a decrease in egg pro- duction (Andrade and Carson, 1975). Toe Trimming Toe trimming is rarely needed except in some re- search situations to identify different strains of laying hens when they are raised in a mixed flock. In this practice, it is common to remove only the nail portion of one toe at hatch from chicks to distinguish the strain. The disadvantages of toe trimming were reported by Honaker and Ruszler (2004), where Leghorn hatchlings whose claws were trimmed through use of microwave energy experienced slight bleeding with minor pain, in- creased mortality, and reduced feed consumption and BW during the pullet grow-out period. Removal of the claws resulted in reduced foot spread, allowing the toe of some pullets to slip into the wired mesh of the cage floor. The pressure on the web between the toes led to a splitting of the foot epidermis in 24 of 1,200 pullets whose claws were trimmed in one experiment. Comp- ton et al. (1981a,b) reported similar results when using a hot blade to reduce claw length and suggested that chick movement in the wired cage was difficult until the toe grew long enough to allow the foot to spread across the wired cage floor. These results suggest that trim- ming the claws of egg-laying strains of chickens is not recommended, except in certain situations where strain identification is needed. Partial Comb and Wattle Removal The comb and wattles are important for thermoregu- lation in birds. Removal of part of the comb (dubbing) and wattles should not be performed on birds housed in facilities that are not appropriately cooled during the summer (Hester et al., 2015; Al-Ramamneh et al., 2016). Dubbing and wattle trims may be needed if birds are kept in cages. Combs and wattles can be caught in wire openings or feeders after significant comb and wat- tle growth has occurred (Card and Nesheim, 1972; Fair- full et al., 1985). This is more prevalent in cages with vertical wire cage fronts and has been mitigated with the development of horizontal wire cage fronts. Comb and wattle removal is more commonly performed on cockerels because these structures are larger in males. Dubbing or removal of part of the wattles is used as a last resort when equipment or housing conditions can- not be modified to prevent torn or damaged combs or wattles. To perform successful comb and wattle removal with minimal bleeding and excellent long-term results, sur- gical scissors, a scalpel blade, or an electrocautery/ra- diosurgery electrode (Bennett, 1993, 1994) is used to remove part of the comb and wattle during the first few days after hatching. To reduce risk of infection between birds, the surgical device needs to be disinfected.Pinioning Surgical pinioning is the act of surgically removing the wing at the pinion joint (the joint farthest from the body) to prevent flight. The portion removed is the metacarpal, the point on the wing where the primary flight feathers originate. The procedure is accomplished using a hot blade and a bar apparatus mounted in a Lyons trimmer. One wing (i.e., left or right) is extended and a cut made through the joint at the intracarpal ligament between the radius and ulna and the first pha- lanx of the third and fourth digit. Simultaneously, the hot blade cauterizes all cuts, stopping any bleeding and enabling the birds to recover much faster. The pain and distress associated with this procedure at 1 d of age is similar to that of beak trimming at 6 to 10 d (Startup, 1967). Pinioning is usually done as a means to reduce bird flightiness. If flightiness is problematic, the pri- mary feathers of one wing may be clipped, a process called \"temporary pinioning.\" Induced Molting As birds approach sexual maturity, their plumage is normally replaced through a natural molt. Birds also molt naturally after sexual maturity at some point, which results in a pause in egg production of varying duration, and individuals do not remain in synchronous egg production stages with others in the flock. Some triggers of a natural molt in birds include a reduction in the daily photoperiod, dramatic changes in environ- mental temperature, or food deprivation. An induced synchronized molt is used to rejuvenate laying flocks to extend the productive life of hens for an additional cycle of production. Molting remains a common pro- cedure for commercial table-egg layers even though its use is declining. This is due to the use of egg-laying strains of hens that can lay persistently at a high rate with acceptable eggshell quality in a single cycle. In re- cycled commercial flocks of egg-laying strains of chick- ens, molting decreases the demand for chicks by 47%. Benefits of molting include feather rejuvenation, which improves thermoregulation (Anderson, 2012). After a molt, livability and egg quality were improved during the second cycle of egg production compared with a nonmolt control group (Bell, 2003). Several procedures can be used to induce a molt, in- cluding manipulation of dietary energy (Dickey et al., 2010, 2012), protein levels (Anderson, 2002), and di- etary ingredients such as calcium (Gilbert and Blair, 1975), iodine (Herbert and Cerniglia, 1979), sodium (Whitehead and Shannon, 1974), or zinc (Park et al., 2004); addition of feed additives that influence the neu- roendocrine system such as iodinated casein (Kuenzel Bass et al., 2007); and short-term (Ruszler, 1998) and long-term feed withdrawal. Researchers have developed non-feed-withdrawal molting programs, which are preferred by the egg in-189 CHAPTER 12: EGG-TYPE POULTRY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020dustry. Several researchers have used feed ingredients such as cassava meal and broken rice (Gongruttananun et al., 2013), bitter vetch (Sadeghi and Mohammadi, 2009), alfalfa meal (Donalson et al., et al., 2009; McReynolds 2009), ace and safflower meal (Patwardhan et al., 2011a,b), alfalfa meal and barley (Sar\u00f6zkan et al., 2013), and corn distillers dried grains with solubles (Mejia et al., 2010, 2011; Bland et al., 2014) in molt diets with suc- cessful results. These procedures may be coupled with a reduction in daily photoperiod. These methods cause a cessation of egg production along with decreased BW and feather loss. A return to egg laying, feather re- growth, and BW gain are accomplished by feeding a diet designed to meet the nutritional requirements for non-ovulating, feather-growing hens (Anderson, 2002; Bell, 2003). Until 2000, the most common procedure used to in- duce a molt was to withdraw feed for 4 to 14 d without water restriction (Yousaf and Chaudhry, 2008). Feed withdrawal to induce ovarian arrest is stressful (Alo- dan and Mashaly, 1999; Kogut et al., 1999; Davis et al., 2000; Kuenzel, 2003), leading to increased mortality during the first 2 wk of the molt (Bell, 2003). Hens were more fearful during a fasted molt compared with before and after a molt (Anderson et al., 2007). Temporary frustration (Duncan and Wood-Gush, 1971), as indicat- ed by a moderate increase in aggression on the first day of feed removal, has been noted in molted hens com- pared with nonmolted full-fed controls (Webster, 2000). Aggression dissipated by the end of the first day, and molting hens showed elevated activity on the second day of fasting as indicated by increased nonnutritive pecking, standing, and head movement. Resting behav- ior increased by d 3 of fasting, and although nonnutri- tive pecking decreased from d 2, this pecking, interpret- ed as a redirection of foraging activity, remained higher than in control hens (Webster, 2000). Resting behavior persisted for the remaining part of the fast (Webster, 2000; Anderson et al., 2004). Similar changes in be- havior of hens subjected to a fasting molting regimen have been reported by Simonsen (1979) and Aggrey et al. (1990), with an additional behavioral repertoire of increased preening on d 8 to 10 after feed removal, most likely coinciding with the dropping of feathers.

HANDLING AND TRANSPORT Refer to Chapter 5: Animal Handling and Transport for information on handling and transportation of egg- type poultry.SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS Genetically Modified Birds To date, there are no special animal care require- ments for transgenic, cloned, or CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-edited poultry. These birds are cared for in the same manner as conventionally domesticated birds unless the genetic manipulation affects basic bird needs. Future transgen- ic animals may have special requirements (e.g., birds with specific gene insertions), and they should be cared for based on their genotype and phenotype. Refer to Chapter 1: Institutional Policies for general information on the care and use of genetically modified animals. Surgeries All intrathoracic and intra-abdominal invasive sur- the testes) and cecectomy (removal of the ceca) are invasive surgical procedures that require anesthesia; see sections in Chapter 2: Agricultural Animal Health Care that deal with surgery of experimental animals. EUTHANASIA Appropriate methods of euthanasia are covered in Chapter 2: Agricultural Animal Health Care and in the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals (AVMA, 2020). In addition, further information on the meth- ods of euthanasia for poultry are also detailed in the Practical Guidelines for On-Farm Euthanasia of Poultry (PICC, 2016). For the purpose of euthanasia of poultry, the AVMA guidelines accept injection of overdoses of anesthetics, including barbiturates and barbituric acid derivatives. AVMA accepts, with conditions, the use of the following inhaled agents: carbon dioxide, car- bon monoxide, nitrogen, argon, or mixtures of nitrogen or argon with carbon dioxide. The following physical methods are acceptable with conditions: cervical dis- location (performed manually or with mechanical as- sistance), decapitation, manually applied blunt force trauma, electrocution, gunshot (not recommended for captive poultry where restraint is feasible), and pen- etrating and nonpenetrating captive bolt. Intravenous or intracardiac administration of potassium chloride or magnesium sulfate and exsanguination are acceptable adjunctive methods, provided the bird is anesthetized or rendered unconscious first. Methods of euthanasia need to be selected to take into account any special requirements of experimental protocols so that useful data are not lost. When relatively large numbers are involved, expo- sure to gas euthanasia agents, such as carbon dioxide, in enclosed chambers may be preferred. Atmospheres containing a significant amount of carbon dioxide cause 190 CHAPTER 12: EGG-TYPE POULTRY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020birds to head shake and breathe deeply. These behav- ioral changes are not caused by irritation of mucosal epithelia in the nares or throat because they occur at carbon dioxide levels below the threshold of trigemi- nal nerve nociception; that is, 40 to 50% carbon diox- ide based on a laboratory study of nerve fiber activity in chickens (McKeegan, 2004). Furthermore, although poultry can detect atmospheres containing carbon di- oxide and may show responses indicative of some de- gree of aversion, several studies have demonstrated that most chickens and turkeys will voluntarily enter carbon dioxide concentrations as high as 60 to 80% under mod- erate motivation to obtain food (Webster and Fletcher, 2004; McKeegan et al., 2005, 2006; Sandilands et al., 2011). Because poultry can be rendered unconscious with 30% carbon dioxide in air, or less if enough time is al- lowed (Webster and Fletcher, 2001; Gerritzen et al., 2007), and concentrations of carbon dioxide above 50% quickly kill adult birds (Raj and Gregory, 1990a), it is not necessary to measure the carbon dioxide concentra- tion closely when performing euthanasia. However, the process needs to be observed and carbon dioxide added, if necessary, to ensure that death is attained without undue delay. Although euthanasia of poultry in high concentrations of carbon dioxide (60-80%) is relatively rapid, anoxia caused by the high gas concentration pro- motes convulsive wing flapping after loss of posture, which can be disagreeable to human observers. Slower induction of unconsciousness using lower concentra- tions of carbon dioxide, with or without supplemental oxygen, appears to sedate birds and reduce convulsions after loss of posture (Raj and Gregory, 1990a; Webster and Fletcher, 2001; Coenen et al., 2009; Gerritzen et al., 2013). Newly hatched poultry may have a greater tolerance to carbon dioxide, so higher concentrations may be needed for euthanasia of these birds (AVMA, 2020). Anoxia using argon or nitrogen, or mixtures of these gases with carbon dioxide, is effective to kill poultry with minimal distress, but residual oxygen should be kept low; for example, 2% (Raj and Gregory, 1990b; Raj and Whittington, 1995). Anoxia causes convulsive wing flapping after loss of posture. Although convul- sions may occur at a time when a degree of conscious- ness is possible (McKeegan et al., 2007; Coenen et al., 2009), the bird's experience would be short. Anoxia by controlled reduction of atmospheric pressure may also be a humane way to kill chickens with appropri- ate equipment (McKeegan et al., 2013). When using anoxia, the final gas concentration should be achieved quickly enough to avoid development of ataxia in con- scious birds (Woolley and Gentle, 1988). Blunt force trauma and shooting with a captive bolt cause immediate insensibility due to brain damage and are effective methods of euthanasia when properly applied (Erasmus et al., 2010a,b; Bader et al., 2014; Cors et al., 2015). Sufficient force and accuracy in the application of either technique is essential (Raj and O'Callaghan, 2001; Cors et al., 2015). A second blow or shot must be administered immediately if it is evi- dent that the first one was not effective. Monitoring of birds is important to ensure that death follows. It is acceptable for a properly trained individual to use cer- vical dislocation without stunning or anesthesia when a limited number of birds of an appropriate size require euthanasia. Following cervical dislocation, the necks of birds should be checked for separation of vertebrae at or near the base of the skull. Use of a burdizzo to crush the cervical vertebrae is not considered acceptable un- less the bird is rendered unconscious first (AVMA, 2020). Death from blunt force trauma or captive bolt shot appears to follow from direct disruption of brain function, whereas cervical dislocation appears to cause death by cerebral hypoxia and ischemia (Gregory and Wotton, 1990; Erasmus et al., 2010b). Blunt force trau- ma, captive bolt shooting, and cervical dislocation re- sult in vigorous convulsive wing flapping. Embryonated eggs may be destroyed by chilling at 4\u00b0C for 4 h or freezing (Close et al., 1997), or by ex- posure to CO 2 for 20 min (AVMA, 2020). Decapita- tion or anesthetic overdose are suitable methods for embryos that have been exposed for experimental pur- poses. Maceration in a purpose-designed macerator, a mechanical apparatus with rotating blades, is also an acceptable method for killing embryos and surplus neo- natal chicks (AVMA, 2020).

EGG-TYPE POULTRY Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020INTRODUCTION In commercial meat duck production today, the Pekin duck is the predominant breed, followed by Muscovy and Mule ducks. A typical Pekin duck can reach market weight of about 3.1 kg (6.8 lb) at 5 wk, with a feed con- version ratio of approximately 1.7. Breast meat yield, which is considered the most important selection trait in Western countries, averages 20% of carcass weight. The Muscovy duck is slower growing, with less fat and greater sexual dimorphism in body weight (BW). Fe- male Muscovy ducks are generally marketed 2 to 3 wk earlier than males to limit carcass fat deposition. Mule ducks are a hybrid sterile cross between Pekin and Muscovy ducks and have comparable BW between the 2 sexes, removing the obstacle associated with market- ing females at a different age. Mule ducks are favored by certain markets for their good carcass composition with more meat and less fat than Pekin ducks. Both Muscovy and Mule ducks are usually grown to around 10 wk of age to a market weight of 2.75 to 3 kg (6.1 to 6.6 lb) with a feed conversion ratio of approximately 2.75. For meat goose production, a typical goose can reach a market weight of 4 kg (8.8 lb) at 8 to 10 wk of age, whereas a heavy-type goose will go to market at 12 wk at a BW of 6.0 kg (13.2 lb). In the wild, dabbling waterfowl\u2014the ancestors of do- mestic waterfowl\u2014are aquatic birds that obtain their food either by foraging on land or along the water's edge, in grass, or through mud by filtering food from non-food through the lamellae in their bills (\"dabbling,\" Guillemain et al., 2000; Cherry and Morris, 2008). In addition to species-specific feeding behaviors, wild wa- terfowl perform a considerable amount of preening, which allows them to remove dirt and parasites from their feathers. In a commercial setting, waterfowl dis- play similar behaviors to their undomesticated ances- tors. Generally, waterfowl are social animals, so housing in isolation should be avoided unless necessary for the experimental design. Also, unless necessary for experi- mental design or teaching purposes, it is recommended that bill trimming and molting be avoided. Although Pekin ducks may not require nail trimming, larger wa- terfowl species such as Muscovy ducks or geese may need to be nail-trimmed for the protection of conspecif-ics and humans working with these animals. The neces- sity of nail trimming should be left to the discretion of the investigator. Refer to Chapter 12: Egg-Type Poul- try for detailed discussions of molting and bill trim- ming. The purpose of this chapter is to provide guide- lines for the care and use of waterfowl in research and teaching as suggested by studies of the specific species whenever possible. FACILITIES AND ENVIRONMENT Space Utilization Use of floor area by birds within groups follows a di- urnal pattern and is influenced by the dimensions and design of the facility. Waterfowl may huddle together for shared warmth or spread out for heat dissipation. Birds generally use less area during resting and groom- ing than during periods of higher activity and will often seek the protection offered by the walls of the enclo- sure (Newberry and Hall, 1990; Cornetto and Estevez, 2001). Recommendations for minimum floor area for multiple-bird pens and cages as well as individually housed birds are presented in Table 13-1. Because of a relative absence of research on well-being indicators for ducks, and especially for geese and other waterfowl poultry species, these recommendations are based on professional judgment and experience. Generally, area allowances are assumed adequate when productivity of the individual birds is optimal and conditions that are likely to produce injury and disease are minimal. Flooring Most research on flooring types for waterfowl has been conducted on ducks; however, observations suggest that geese may have similar requirements. However, the expertise of researchers and educators for all waterfowl species should be considered. Ducks may be kept on solid floors with litter or in cages or pens with raised wire floors of appropriate gauge and mesh dimension. Solid floors are better for heavy strains of waterfowl. When waterfowl reside on solid floors, litter provides a cushion during motor activity and resting and absorbs CHAPTER 13: WATERFOWL 199water from droppings. Typically, floor litter in duck barns is made up of pine shavings or straw, although other substrates may be used. The ideal litter can ab- sorb large quantities of water and release it quickly to promote rapid drying. A dry, dusty litter or a litter that is too wet will have a negative effect on the health, welfare, and performance of waterfowl. When sampled away from the drinkers, the litter should be moist but not so wet that it forms into a ball resistant to crum- bling when compressed in the hand. Litter should not emit excessive dust when disturbed. The poultry house should be ventilated to prevent litter from becoming overly moist. Avoiding excess moisture in the litter im- proves bird health by preventing feces and dirt from ad- hering to the foot, which can lead to foot pad dermati- tis, hock lesions, leg defects, and stress, as measured by fecal corticosterone levels (Stamp Dawkins et al., 2004). Particular attention should be paid to the type of floor provided in pens or cages for the common duck; flooring type should consider experimental design ne- cessity balanced with the fact that the epidermis on the feet and legs of this species is less cornified than that of domesticated land fowl (duck feet are more susceptible to injury; Koch, 1973). Properly designed, nonirritating floor surfaces minimize risk of injury to the foot pad and hock and reduce the incidence of subsequent joint infections. Dry litter floors are least irritating to the feet and hock joints of ducks and should be used when- ever possible, particularly if ducks are going to be kept for extended periods. Litter floors that are not kept dry present a serious threat to the health of the flock. Wire floors and cage bottoms with proper design may be used without serious adverse effects if ducks are not kept on them for more than 3 mo. Young ducks or smaller egg-type breeds (e.g., Khaki Campbell) are less susceptible to irritation from wire flooring than are old- er ducks or larger meat-type breeds (e.g., Pekin). Prop-erly constructed wire floors and cage bottoms should provide a smooth, rigid surface that is free of sags and abrasive spots. Twelve-gauge welded wire with a 2.5-cm (1-in) mesh is usually satisfactory for all ducks over 3 wk of age. Mesh size should be reduced to 1.9 cm (0.75 in) for ducklings less than 3 wk of age. Vinyl-coated wire is preferable, but stainless steel or smooth galva- nized wire floors are satisfactory. Raised plastic flooring is commonly used in commercial duck production, and welfare quality assessments are similar to those for pine litter flooring (Fraley et al., 2013; Karcher et al., 2013). Irritation to the feet (footpad dermatitis) and legs of ducks is reduced greatly if hard flooring such as wire occupies only a portion of the total floor area of a pen. In large floor pens, one-third wire and two-thirds lit- ter is a satisfactory combination. Provision of drinking devices over the wire-covered section of the pen greatly reduces deposition of water into the litter. Maintenance of litter in a satisfactorily dry condition is considerably more difficult in housing for ducks than for chickens and turkeys. Ducklings drink approximately 20% more water than they need for normal growth (Veltmann and Sharlin, 1981) and, as a result, the moisture content of their droppings is relatively high\u2014approximately 90% (Dean, 1984). To offset this extra water input in duck houses, provision of extra litter and removal of excess water vapor by the ventilation system are essential. Supplemental heat may be necessary to aid in moisture control. Brooding Temperatures and Ventilation Because thermoregulatory ability is poorly developed in young ducklings, higher environmental temperatures are required during the brooding period. Heat require- ments of ducklings may be met by a variety of brooding environments (e.g., floor pen housing with hovers or radiant heaters distributed in localized areas, battery brooders, and cage or pen units in heated rooms). Ventilation is gradually increased over the first few weeks of the brooding period. Whether ventilation is by a mechanical system or involves natural airflow, drafts should be avoided. In relatively open brooding facilities, such as in barns with windows or curtains for ventilation, draft shields may be beneficial up to 10 d after hatching. Young birds may huddle together or cluster when sleeping but are likely to disperse when awake. Within limits, ducklings can maintain appro- priate body temperatures by moving away from or to- ward sources of heat when possible and by avoiding or seeking contact with other individuals. The huddling of young birds in a single group directly under the heat source, especially during waking hours, usually indi- cates the need for more supplemental heat, whereas over-dispersal away from the heat source or other birds, characteristically associated with panting, indicates that the environment is too warm. With brooding systems that allow birds to move to- ward or away from heat sources, the temperature sur-Table 13-1.

When the entire room is heated but chicks are not free to move to cooler areas, temper- atures may be too high. Thus, during the first week af- ter hatching, a lower temperature (e.g., approximately 29.5\u00b0C) may reduce the lethargy and nonresponsiveness that is otherwise likely to be seen. Areas with minimum temperatures that are adequate for comfort and prevent chilling should be available to young birds. Minimum temperatures of 26.5 to 29.5\u00b0C (80 to 85\u00b0F) and weekly decreases of 3.3\u00b0C (6\u00b0F) are suggested until supplemen- tary heat is no longer needed. After birds have fully feathered (about 23 d of age), ducks are comfortable at environmental temperatures of 10 to 15\u00b0C (50 to 60\u00b0F). The recommended ventilation rates for chickens and turkeys (Davis and Dean, 1968) have yielded good re- sults with ducks and, presumably, geese. However, lower relative humidity is desirable in duck houses compared with chicken houses to help offset the high water con- tent of duck droppings. Proper screening underneath the watering equipment in houses with litter floors and the addition of generous amounts of litter are neces- sary features of a moisture-control program. When the outside temperature allows, supplemental heat may be used to help dry litter to control moisture build-up in duck houses. Lighting A lighting program providing 18 h of light with 6 h of dark is ideal, but waterfowl are adaptable to a range of diurnal photo- and scotoperiods. Waterfowl are typi- cally incandescent, or lighting or even kerosene lanterns in commercial set- tings around the world. No adverse effects have been noted for any of the light sources. It has been sug- gested that fluorescent lights that utilize older ballasts allow light \"flicker\" that may produce an environment stressful to chickens; however, this has not been specifi- cally tested (Rogers et al., 2015). The use of fluorescent lights with modern digital ballasts is recommended to eliminate such concerns. The output of light (i.e., wave- length and photonic energy) is important, rather than the particular bulb type (e.g., LED, fluorescent, or in- candescent). Red or white light provides the best environmen- tal conditions for waterfowl at any age, and blue light should be avoided unless necessary for the experimen- tal design. The effect of red or blue lighting has been minimally studied in ducks, but research has suggested that in grow-out ducks, red light may have some advan- tage in terms of reduced activity and feather picking (on self) or feather pecking (on conspecifics); however, the reduced activity does not translate to improved growth rates or carcass quality (Campbell et al., 2015). Interestingly, unlike chickens, housing ducks under blue light may have detrimental effects in terms of behav-ior, growth rate, and carcass quality (Campbell et al., 2015). The negative effects of blue light have also been observed in the endocrine profiles of the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal and somatotropic axes (Campbell et al., 2015). A single study showed that blue LED light was not appropriate for white Roman breeder geese (Chang et al., 2016). Experimental design should en- sure that white light sources among treatment groups emit light in the same ranges of wavelengths (i.e., have similar color temperature in degrees kelvin) and that the lux meter used is capable of measuring the wave- lengths emitted. However, the effects of higher or lower light intensities on waterfowl welfare have not been ex- amined to date. FEED AND WATER Feed Circular or linear troughs can be used to supply feed. Feed troughs can be located either inside or outside the area where birds are housed. If feed troughs are located outside the space in which the birds are housed (as is the case for most adult cages), then only one side of the trough is available to the birds. Unless the feeder is mounted on a wall, feeders located in the area where the birds are housed generally provide access to both sides of the trough. Minimum feeder space recommen- dations for ducks are shown in Table 13-2. Feeder space allocation in the tables is presented as linear trough space per bird assuming both sides of the trough are available. If only one side of the trough is available, then the amount of feeder space per bird should be doubled. The parental stocks of meat-type ducks (breeders) are prone to excessive BW gain that leads to obesity- related health issues unless energy intake is controlled beginning early in life. Breeders should be allocated limited amounts of feed to allow for a gradual increase Table 13-2.

If only one side of the trough is available, double the amount of feeder space/bird. Perimeter space for round feeders is obtained by multiplying linear trough space by 0.8.201 Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020 CHAPTER 13: WATERFOWLin BW each week. Under feed restriction, breeders may show stereotypic pecking on non-nutritive objects and excessive drinking of water. Overfeeding or excessive food restriction may reduce fertility (Savory et al., 1993). Feed should be allocated and BW routinely moni- tored to maintain the recommended BW for the partic- ular stock and age. Inhibition of feeding by subordinate birds is likely if feeder space is limited (Cunningham and van Tienhoven, 1984). Rations may be offered as a fixed amount of feed allotted daily or according to various alternate-day feeding schemes. Alternate-day feed restriction as opposed to limited feed each day al- lows subordinate birds access to feed, resulting in bet- ter flock uniformity (Bell and Weaver, 2002). There- fore, procedures that require restricted feeding should provide enough feeder space so that all birds can eat concurrently. It may also be helpful to use low-density diets and provide birds with environmental enrichment devices that they can manipulate to satisfy their feed- seeking behaviors (Colton and Fraley, 2014). Ducks experience difficulty consuming mash-type feed because as the mash becomes moist from saliva or drinking water, it may cake on their mouthparts and lead to physical restriction to ingest feed. Therefore, it is recommended that feeds for ducks be provided in pelleted form. Nutrition The nutrient requirements of waterfowl vary depend- ing upon species, age, production purpose (meat vs. reproduction), environment, season (Raveling, 1978), and experimental needs for BW gain, feed efficiency, or carcass yield. In addition to nutrient specifications, other factors should be taken into consideration, in- cluding form of the feed and feed safety. Feed Safety. Ensuring feed safety is crucial when raising waterfowl. No anti-coccidial medications should be included in the feed because waterfowl housed in clean conditions are less susceptible to coccidial infec- tions than chickens. Anti-coccidial medications in feed can be toxic to ducks. It is recommended that water- fowl feed ingredients and finished feeds be tested to ensure the absence of the major mycotoxins. Water- fowl, Pekin ducks in particular, are extremely sensitive to mycotoxins (Davis et al., 1994) such as aflatoxin. Levels as low as 0.1 mg of aflatoxin B 1/kg of diet can lead to significantly impaired growth, liver function, and immune dynamics in Pekin ducklings. Given that it is common practice to include multiple feedstuffs in typical diets, simultaneous exposure to multiple myco- toxins is possible, which may have synergistic effects on the health of a bird. In addition, feeding low-protein diets can exacerbate the negative effects of mycotox- ins; therefore, extra caution is needed when low-protein diets are fed (Chen et al., 2014, 2016). Most species of waterfowl are very susceptible to heavy metals such as cadmium, lead, and arsenic (Leeson and Summers, 2009), although toxic levels are unlikely to be encoun- tered. Water. Water is an essential and critical nutrient for waterfowl, which consume water in much greater quantities than other poultry species. In general, water consumption by waterfowl is at least 4 times greater than their feed intake. Clean, fresh drinking water must be provided at all times. Contrary to popular belief, there is no need to provide swimming water for ducks or geese. Waterfowl should have access to clean water for drinking at all times unless the experimental design specifically limits access. Table 13-3 lists the minimum requirement for water access in ducks; similar data are not available for geese. Thus, the expertise and recom- mendations of researchers or educators should be con- sidered when evaluating water access for geese. Nipple drinker water lines should be arranged to ensure a max- imum density of 3 adult ducks per nipple. In the European Union, the use of nipple water lines has been criticized for not allowing ducks to perform behaviors such as dabbling, head-dipping, bathing, swimming, or wet preening and thus not adequate for the welfare of waterfowl, specifically ducks (Rodenburg et al., 2005; Jones et al., 2009; Jones and Dawkins, 2010). However, these studies typically relied upon very small sample sizes and their conclusions contradict the findings of original studies (reviewed by Rodenburg et al., 2005) that demonstrated wet preening did in fact occur with nipple water line systems. The purpose of preening is to maintain feather quality and cleanliness in healthy birds. A recent study showed that commer- cially housed ducks preen effectively and just as often, regardless of where they are in relation to the water source within a barn (Rice et al., 2014). Several studies have shown that ducks housed in systems with nipple water lines show excellent body condition, particularly eye and feather quality and feather cleanliness, regard- less of other differences in management or environmen- tal conditions (Fraley et al., 2013; Karcher et al., 2013; Table 13-3.

If only one side of the trough is available, double the amount of drinker space/bird. 2Water trough dimensions are according to RSPCA Guidelines (RSPCA, 2015); however, open water sources should be avoided as described in the Water subsection of this chapter.202 CHAPTER 13: WATERFOWL Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020Campbell et al., 2014, 2015; Colton and Fraley, 2014; Rice et al., 2014). Therefore, waterfowl should be given access to water via nipple water lines, and open wa- ter sources should be avoided unless necessary for the study design. Bacterial contamination must be consid- ered if open water sources are used. Most conventional poultry drinkers may be used for ducks, except for cup drinkers that are smaller in di- ameter than the width of the duck's bill. If ducks are provided water for swimming or some other wet envi- ronment (such as showers), they should also have ac- cess to a clean and dry place; otherwise, the protection normally provided by their waterproof, insulated feath- ers might be lost. The use of nipple water lines should be the standard for waterfowl in teaching and research settings, unless the proposed experimental or teaching program specifically requires an environment with an open water source. HUSBANDRY Handling of Waterfowl Unlike other poultry species, waterfowl cannot be caught and picked up by the wings or legs because this could cause physical damage to their limbs. Ducks may be grasped around the upper (distal third) neck, tak- ing care not to restrict airways or blood vessels on the anterior throat area. A duck correctly lifted from the floor in this manner will remain calm and allow itself to be carried a short distance. Small to medium-size ducks (up to ~1,500 g) may be picked up with thumbs re- straining the wings and fingers wrapped gently around the rest of the body, but care should be taken to en- sure that the thoracic cavity can expand for respira- tion. When carrying ducks for extended distances (>5 m), the duck should be cradled in one arm with its abdomen resting on the caretaker's forearm, wings re- strained between the caretaker's forearm and body, legs held gently between the fingers, and the duck's head in the armpit area. Carrying a duck properly restrained in this fashion will greatly minimize risk of injury to the duck and caretaker. Because of differences in body size and temperament, extreme caution should be used when handling larger waterfowl such as geese. Social Environment Ducks and geese are highly social animals and should be kept in groups when possible. The social repertoire has been extensively described for dabbling ducks and, to a lesser extent, for domestic geese and Muscovy ducks. Research on the behavior of ducks and geese in commercial flocks is relatively sparse. When housed in small groups, geese and ducks exhibit socially coordi- nated movements (Ramseyer et al., 2009; Liste et al., 2014) and can be observed sharing resources when open resources are available (Waitt et al., 2009; Makagon and Mench, 2011). Behavioral observations conducted on commercial duck farms also highlight social toler- ance and resource sharing (Jones and Dawkins, 2010; Rice et al., 2014). Like other poultry species, ducks and geese communicate using visual and vocal signals (McKinney, 1969; Miller, 1977). Tactile contact plays a key role in promoting social flexibility among ducklings (Gottlieb, 1993). Social experiences with age-matched ducklings within the first days of life have significant effects on subsequent social preferences and behaviors (reviewed by Lickliter et al., 1993) and sexual prefer- ences (Bossema et al., 1982). Therefore, for normal behavioral development, waterfowl should have social interaction starting at an early age. When group hous- ing is not possible, birds should, at minimum, be able to hear, see, and touch one another through a wire partition. When birds are kept in group housing, a fear re- sponse may result in birds trampling each other and piling up against barriers or in corners, with resulting injury and mortality. Mule and Pekin ducks show a more pronounced fear response than Muscovy ducks (Arnaud et al., 2010). Husbandry methods should be used to prevent death caused by smothering. Sudden changes to the environment should be minimized unless dictated by the experimental design. Feather pecking, picking, and cannibalism can occur in duck flocks, more commonly among Muscovy ducks (Rodenburg et al., 2005). Although the specific causes leading to feather pecking are not well understood, high stocking density can be a contributing factor (as reviewed by Roden- burg et al., 2005). Other risk factors include genetic strain, light schedule, and nutrition (Gustafson et al., 2007a,b). Injury to females that results from excessive mounting by drakes is a concern for sexually mature breeder ducks. The current recommendation for Pe- kin duck breeders is that the ratio of males to females not exceed 1:5; the flock may require periodic sex ratio adjustment throughout the breeding cycle to prevent harm to females (Cherry and Morris, 2008). Nest Boxes Although details of nest box design and placement may depend on experimental or teaching needs, nest boxes should be provided for all sexually mature breed- er flocks because they provide for easier egg collection, cleaner eggs, and a decreased risk of cloacal cannibal- ism. It is recommended that nest boxes be dark inside and offer maximal concealment. Nests should be pro- vided with a suitable floor substrate (e.g., turf pads or wood shavings) that encourages nesting behavior. Nests with wire floors or plastic-coated wire floors alone should be avoided to prevent injury to the ducks' feet. The provision of loose litter material inside and out- side nests can be useful for training hens to use nests. Nest boxes should be regularly inspected and cleaned as necessary to ensure that there is minimal manure 203 CHAPTER 13: WATERFOWL Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020accumulation. Birds should have easy access to nest boxes. Nest boxes should be placed at ground level for geese and most domestic duck breeds. Muscovy ducks are cavity dwellers; therefore, Muscovy nests can be raised above ground level. Outdoor Access or Free Range Information for porches or winter gardens for ducks is not available. When immature ducks are first intro- duced to the range, they need to be shown the location of feeders, drinkers, and shelters. It is recommended that outdoor feeders and drinkers be surrounded by slatted or solid flooring to prevent the ground in the immediate area from becoming saturated with water. If ponds are available, they should be well maintained to prevent accumulation of stagnant water that contains decaying vegetation. Serious consideration should be given to the likelihood of predation or fecal contamina- tion from wild birds in flight. Botulism in ducks can be a problem when pond water is not well aerated or not filtered to remove plant debris (Shin et al., 2010; Ray- mundo et al., 2012). Developing breeders may be raised outdoors on well-drained soil (preferably sand) with open shelter. A minimum of 1,290 cm2 (200 in2) of shel- ter area/bird is recommended for developing breeders. STANDARD AGRICUL TURAL PRACTICES Incubation The biology of incubation is a fascinating process when the unique differences among species are consid- ered, in particular, egg and embryo temperature regu- lation and correlated physiologic adaptations (Webb, 1987). Egg turning or rotation is a necessity for all avian species, and waterfowl are no exception. Meth- ods for egg rotation, or turning, in the incubator are identical to those for other poultry species. As such, please refer to other chapters for details. It has been recognized for many years that incubation temperature is only one of many factors that can influence day-old hatchling quality (Tona et al., 2005) and post-hatch performance (Ducuypere, 1984). Romanoff (1935) is the most frequently cited literature source for the wide- ly accepted \"optimal\" incubation temperature of 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F) for (1936) recommended that incubation tempera- ture be decreased to approximately 36\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F) after 16 d of incubation in consideration of the metabolic heat produced by older embryos. The recommended temperatures for chicks confirmed the earlier studies in turkeys and correlated effects on length of incubation and post-hatch growth (Romanoff, 1935). Increased temperatures during the early stages of incubation de- crease the overall length of the incubation period (Ro- manoff and Faber, 1933; Henderson, 1939). Romanoff (1936) observed a linear decline in hatchability with each 1\u00b0C (1.8\u00b0F) increase from 37.5 to 40.5\u00b0C, which was the basis for his suggested 36.5\u00b0C as the optimal temperature from 16 d to hatch in chickens. The lat- ter observation of heat production by older embryos is the reason that current commercial incubation practice includes a gradual reduction in temperature over the latter half of the incubation period and this is true for all commercial poultry. Lourens et al. (2005) suggested that eggshell temperature was the most accurate, non- destructive assessment of actual embryo temperature, and the practice of monitoring eggshell temperature has been implemented in many commercial hatcheries with a target temperature of 37.5 to 37.8\u00b0C (99.5 to 100\u00b0F). In commercial practice, either air temperature or eggshell temperature together with relative humidity (~56%) are the most common standard industry met- rics that are routinely monitored. As alluded to above, these metrics will vary by age of the embryo and incu- bation practice (single-stage vs. multi-stage). ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT Refer to Chapter 4: Environmental Enrichment for information on enrichment of environments for water- fowl. HANDLING AND TRANSPORT Refer to Chapter 5: Animal Handling and Transport for information on handling and transportation of wa- terfowl. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS Anesthesia Anesthesia for birds in general and ducks in particu- lar is vastly different than that for mammals. Physi- ological and metabolic differences as well as responses to stress vary widely. Usually, the dose of anesthetic is higher in birds than in mammals because of their higher metabolic rate (Machin et al., 2004). Handling of birds may reduce respiratory function, and placing birds on their backs can compromise respiratory func- tion due to the weight of abdominal viscera pressing on the air sacs (Ludders et al., 1995). Thoracic compres- sion in small birds often results in respiratory depres- sion and death (Machin et al., 2004). Due to the diving response, ducks can have bradycardia and apnea from masks placed over the bill or if the bill is taped or tied to maintain proper placement of endotracheal tubes (Ludders et al., 1995). Intubation with artificial ventilation is preferred in waterfowl when using inhalant anesthesia. Inhalant an- esthetics, including isoflurane, sevoflurane, enthurane, and desflurane, have been used for various bird species (Machin et al., 2004). Although inhalant anesthetics allow for rapid adjustment of the depth of anesthesia, 204 CHAPTER 13: WATERFOWL Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020hypoventilation by birds can make it more difficult to maintain anesthesia depth. For most birds, isoflurane is the anesthetic of choice because induction and recovery are generally rapid and isoflurane is less likely than some other agents to cause cardiac issues (Goelz et al., 1990). For ducks, the minimal anesthetic concentration for isoflurane is typically 1.3 \u00b1 0.2%, with an adequate oxygen flow rate to deliver the anesthesia and provide for adequate ventilation. If a non-rebreathing system is being used, an oxygen flow rate of approximately 200 mL/kg per minute is standard (Machin et al., 2004). Although nitrous oxide can supplement anesthesia, it can cause subcutaneous emphysema in waterfowl and therefore is not recommended (Ludders et al., 1995; Grimm et al., 2007). Injectable alone or in combination. However, intra- muscular administration of anesthetics in waterfowl is often not effective (Machin et al., 2004). The main dis- advantage of injectable agents is the inability to reverse the drugs. The duration of pentobarbital is short and can be unsafe in some bird species. Methohexital is con- traindicated in waterfowl (Forbes, 1998; Machin et al., 2004). Ketamine has been used in many species of birds with variable results, and because ketamine alone does not eliminate pain, it must be combined with an anal- gesic agent (Machin et al., 2004). Wing flapping can occur during recovery, so care must be taken to prevent injury. 2-Agonists are rarely used alone but augment other agents by providing analgesia. They can cause hypothermia, muscle tremors, and salivation and usual- ly do not completely immobilize birds when used alone (Forbes, 1998; Machin et al., 2004). Ducks may not respond to combinations of ketamine and 2-agonists. Benzodiazepines such as diazepam and midazolam have been used successfully in birds and have minimal car- diac and respiratory depressive effects. They can be combined with ketamine and opioids for better relax- ation and can be reversed by flumazenil. Opioids are rarely used alone for anesthesia in birds because of respiratory depression but can be effective analgesics in combination with other anesthetics (Concannon et al., 1995; Machin and Caulkett, 1998a). or bolus-administered intra- venous anesthetic with a short recovery period (Sebel and Lowdon, 1989). It is usually only used for short and minimally invasive procedures. Artificial ventilation is recommended with continuous propofol administration and, because it does not provide analgesia, pain must be addressed with other drugs (Machin and Caulkett, 1998b). Analgesia Any procedure performed must include an appropri- ate pain management protocol, unless the experimental design requires otherwise and is approved by the insti-tution's animal care and use committee. Some analge- sics are believed to work well in poultry species (i.e., ketoprofen and some opioids), but research in this field is continually advancing. Therefore, it is imperative that any individual protocol be devised based on the best information currently available (Greenacre, 2008; Hawkins and Paul-Murphy, 2011). EUTHANASIA Euthanasia (\"humane death\") is appropriate for small numbers of individuals or larger flocks. The most commonly used reference is the Guidelines for the Eu- thanasia of Animals by the American Veterinary Medi- cal Association (AVMA, 2020). Regardless of the meth- od used, death should be confirmed by at least two separate measures such as lack of respiration, lack of heart rate, lack of deep pain response, and so on. The only unconditionally approved method of euthanasia is an overdose of barbiturates. Methods that are accept- able with conditions for non-neonatal birds include an overdose of inhaled gas (CO 2, CO, N, Ar, or gas an- esthetics) and physical methods (cervical dislocation, blunt force trauma, electrocution or decapitation with adjunctive methods, captive bolt, or gunshot). Embryo- nated eggs may be euthanized via CO 2, chilling, and freezing. Maceration may be used for pipped eggs and neonates up to 72 h old. Advantages of overdose of injectable barbiturates for euthanasia include positive public perception and the ability to easily euthanize larger birds. The disadvan- tages include the need to use these agents in a secure area (most of these injectable drugs must be stored in a locked container with accurate record keeping, and evacuation of gases must be done in a way that does not injure human operators) and large doses are re- quired for most bird species. Accidental injection of the operator with barbiturates can result in significant injury. In addition, the purchase, storage, and record- keeping of all Scheduled pharmaceuticals requires the supervision of an accredited and US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA)-licensed individual. Using gaseous agents is advantageous when euthaniz- ing larger numbers of birds. Most adult birds will be killed quickly with CO 2 at 100% concentration. How- ever, gas often requires longer exposure times for water- fowl because of the diving reflex. In addition, escaped gases, such as CO and gas anesthetics, can have impli- cations for human and environmental health. Birds of- ten react to rapid administration of gas by open mouth breathing, head shaking, and wing flapping. Cervical dislocation results in rapid death. Anyone performing cervical dislocation must be well trained in the procedure. The AVMA recommends that anyone performing cervical dislocation be trained using al- ready deceased birds or birds destined for euthanasia that have been anesthetized before dislocation (AVMA, 2020). According to the AVMA guidelines, \"the legs of the bird should be grasped (or wings if grasped at the 205 CHAPTER 13: WATERFOWL Ag Guide, 4th ed. 2020base) and the neck stretched by pulling on the head while applying a ventrodorsal rotational force to the skull\" (AVMA, 2020). However, grasping the wings in- stead of legs of waterfowl may cause wing breakage be- fore euthanasia occurs, so gripping the legs is generally recommended for these species. The dislocation must be directly behind the skull at C1-C2 to avulse the brain stem from the spinal cord. Dislocation or crush- ing of lower cervical vertebrae is an unacceptable meth- od of euthanasia. Large birds and birds with longer and thicker necks can pose injury to the operator and are more difficult to cervically dislocate, so other methods are recommended. The necks of all birds must be ex- amined for separation of the vertebrae after euthanasia. Non-penetrating or penetrating captive bolt devices have been used for larger poultry and can be an alter- native, provided that the velocity and angle of impact are appropriate for the specific species. Proper restraint for this method of euthanasia is paramount to minimize stress to the bird, improper implementation, and injury to the human operator. All personnel performing euthanasia must be trained and proficient in whatever method is performed. It is also imperative to confirm death before disposal. Di- lated pupils without a light reflex and lack of audible or palpable heartbeat, breathing, corneal reflex or with- drawal during toe pinch should be used in combination to confirm death. Ultimately, the method of euthanasia must be chosen based on what would cause the least distress to the bird and the least potential harm to the human operator and the environment.

Whenever U.S. Government agencies develop requirements for testing, research, or training procedures involving the use of vertebrate animals, the following principles shall be considered; and whenever these agencies actually per- form or sponsor such procedures, the responsible Insti- tutional Official shall ensure that these principles are adhered to: I. The transportation, care, and use of animals should be in accordance with the Animal Wel- fare Act (7 U.S.C. 2131 et seq.) and other appli- cable Federal laws, guidelines, and policies.* II. Procedures involving animals should be designed and performed with due consideration of their relevance to human or animal health, the ad- vancement of knowledge, or the good of society. III. The animals selected for a procedure should be of an appropriate species and quality and the minimum number required to obtain valid re- sults. Methods such as mathematical models, computer simulation, and in vitro biological sys- tems should be considered. IV. Proper use of animals, including the avoidance or minimization of discomfort, distress, and pain when consistent with sound scientific practices, is imperative. Unless the contrary is established, investigators should consider that procedures that cause pain or distress in human beings may cause pain or distress in other animals. V. Procedures with animals that may cause more than momentary or slight pain or distress should be performed with appropriate sedation, analge- sia, or anesthesia. Surgical or other painful pro- cedures should not be performed on unanesthe- tized animals paralyzed by chemical agents. VI. Animals that would otherwise suffer severe or chronic pain or distress that cannot be relieved should be painlessly killed at the end of the pro- cedure or, if appropriate, during the procedure. VII. The living conditions of animals should be ap- propriate for their species and contribute to their health and comfort. Normally, the housing, feed- ing, and care of all animals used for biomedi- cal purposes must be directed by a veterinarian or other scientist trained and experienced in the proper care, handling, and use of the species be- ing maintained or studied. In any case, veteri- nary care shall be provided as indicated. VIII. Investigators and other personnel shall be appro- priately qualified and experienced for conducting procedures on living animals. Adequate arrange- ments shall be made for their in-service training, including the proper and humane care and use of laboratory animals. IX. Where exceptions are required in relation to the provisions of these Principles, the decisions should not rest with the investigators directly concerned but should be made, with due regard to Principle II, by an appropriate review group such as an institutional animal care and use committee. Such exceptions should not be made solely for the purposes of teaching or demonstra- tion.**APPENDIX I U.S. Government Principles for the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing, Research, and Training *For guidance throughout these Principles, the reader is referred to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals prepared by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, National Academy of Sciences. **Published in the Federal Register, May 20, 1985, Vol. 50, No. 97, by the Office of Science and Technology Policy [FR Doc. 85- 12059]. 208209A AALAS (American Association for Laboratory Animal Science) 4 acclimation, after procurement 9 ACLAM (American College of Laboratory Animal Medicine) 11 ADSA (American Dairy Science Association) x aggression castration and 23, 84 in cattle 60, 83, 84, 85, 98, 105 in egg-laying poultry 39, 180, 182, 184, 188, 189 environmental enrichment and 42 exercise and 34 in goats 39, 142, 144, 146 in horses 33, 114, 118, 119, 120, 123 in meat-type poultry 41, 164, 166, 171 restraints and 59 separation necessitated by 21 in sheep 146 space requirements and 18 in swine 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 129, 130, 133, 134 Ag Guide x, 1 air quality 18-20 for calves 93 for egg-laying poultry 186-187 for horses 115 for meat-type poultry 159 for sheep and goats 141 for swine 127 air temperature 18 air velocity 18 allergies, of personnel 4 American Association for Laboratory Animal Science (AALAS) 4 American College of Laboratory Animal Medicine (ACLAM) 11 American Dairy Science Association (ADSA) x American Registry of Professional Animal Scientists (ARPAS) 4 American Society of Animal Science (ASAS) x American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) depopulation guidelines 15 euthanasia guidelines 3, 15 slaughter guidelines 15 ammonia 19 cattle and 97 egg-laying poultry and 184, 186-187 horses and 115 meat-type poultry and 157, 159 analgesia for cattle 85 drugs used as 13 for horses 123 for sheep and goats 148 for surgery 11-12 for swine 136 for waterfowl 205 anesthesia for cattle 85 for egg-laying poultry 190 for horses 123 for meat-type poultry 171 for sheep and goats 148 for surgery 11-12 for swine 136 for waterfowl 204-205 Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act 13Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act (AMDUCA) 14 animal use protocols (AUP) 2-3 Animal Welfare Act (AWA) 1, 5, 10, 208 Animal Welfare Information Center 4 ARPAS (American Registry of Professional Animal Scientists) 4 artificial insemination (AI) of dairy cattle 102 of horses 121 of swine 135 of turkeys 171 ASAS (American Society of Animal Science) x aseptic surgical procedures 12 attending or program veterinarian procurement of animals and 9 quarantine of animals and 9 role and responsibilities of 10 surgical training oversight by 12 AUP (animal use protocols) 2-3 automated milking systems (AMS) 104 aviaries for egg-laying chickens 178 AVMA.
