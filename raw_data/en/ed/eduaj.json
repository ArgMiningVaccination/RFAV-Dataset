Check out this blog to know about CALM PEMF.", "sitename": "Dr. Roseann", "date": "2023-02-03", "cleaned_text": "The growing prevalence of chronic health issues, pain, and clinical conditions like PANS/PANDAS, Lyme disease, OCD, anxiety, depression, and other mental health disorders has led to a corresponding increase in technology and therapies to support those affected by these conditions. This trend is partly due to the limitations of our current healthcare system, which often focuses on treating symptoms rather than addressing underlying causes, and a greater need for integrative therapies that minimize the risk of side effects. PEMF therapy, such as [CALM PEMF](https://drroseann.com/calmpemf/), is one such technology that has a long history of supporting individuals with a range of health issues. By promoting cellular communication and enhancing the body's natural healing processes, PEMF therapy can relieve pain, improve mental health and cognitive function, and support overall wellness. As a non-invasive and drug-free therapy, it is an appealing option for individuals seeking natural and holistic approaches to healing and well-being. As the demand for effective and safe health solutions grows, PEMF therapy will likely play an increasingly important role in the integrative healthcare landscape. What are EMFs? All energy is electromagnetic. All atoms, chemicals, and cells produce an electronic magnetic pulse called an electromagnetic field (EMF). Every organ in the body produces its signature bio-electromagnetic field. Every cell in the body communicates via these electromagnetic fields - at the overall rate of trillions of chemical reactions per second. Cellular communications must be fluid, precise, and synchronized to process these instantaneous exchanges and sustain optimum health. In other words, if these critical communications are disrupted or blocked in any way, the body's cells, tissues, and organs may be compromised, and unhealthy symptoms will follow. Electromagnetic field (EMF) therapies have been studied and used worldwide for decades. Magnetic therapy is based on treating the body with specially designed EMF signals that allow each cell to respond, through sympathetic resonance, in a manner that reinforces its internal vibration (Lakhovsky, 1939). Aren't Some EMFs Bad for You? Man-made, unnatural EMFs come from electrical wiring and equipment. These produce potentially harmful electrosmog that stresses the body. The extended use of gadgets, such as wi-fi, cell phones, and other technologies, constantly bombards people with EMFs, increasing the daily burden. Therapeutic PEMFs are very different and can purposely add beneficial balancing frequencies to the body to decrease the burden of the negative effects of electrosmog and promote healthy cellular communication. A central principle of PEMF therapy, which differs from EMF's, is enhancing cell-cell communication. Intercellular communication is critical for multiple functions within the body. PEMF therapy is similar to charging a battery. [CALM PEMF](https://drroseann.com/calmpemf/) stimulates cells and generates very small microcurrents that tend to run along nerve pathways. This leads to increased intercellular communication and metabolic processes due to increased circulation, oxygenation, alkalization, ATP production (the form of energy used by cells to perform work such as running enzymes), and optimized cell membrane potential. As a result, cells regenerate. Oxidative stress and inflammation are reduced. Immune responses are more robust. The feel-good endorphins are boosted. Depleted adrenal and other endocrine gland functions are restored. We want to improve intercellular communication because defects in cellular-to-cellular communication are associated with a wide variety of diseases, including diabetes, autoimmune disorders, atherosclerosis, cancer, neuropathy, infertility, and other diseases (Trosko et al., 1998). Activating the intracellular signaling mechanism is a key mechanism underlying the therapeutic effects of PEMFs (Seegers, 2001). What is PEMF Therapy? PEMF is an acronym for Pulsed Electromagnetic Field therapy. PEMF is a therapy that promotes cellular communication, enhancing self-healing and wellness. In recent years, it has become an increasingly popular therapy for autoimmune diseases and chronic disease states. Many patients struggling with physical and cognitive issues that result from [Lyme](https://drroseann.com/how-does-lyme-affect-the-brain/), infectious disease, injury, and -autoimmune disease use and benefit from PEMF. Our Ridgefield, [CT center uses CALM PEMF on those struggling with mental health issues](https://drroseann.com/pemf-for-anxiety-ocd-and-depression/) such as anxiety, OCD, depression, ADHD, PANS/PANDAS, etc. We work with people in person and remotely with mobile devices to support people worldwide. Cellular communication is critical to the body's adaptation and regulation processes, which help to maintain overall health and deal with the symptoms and causes of cell deterioration and disease. Every organ in the body has its bio-electromagnetic field, and every cell communicates via electromagnetic signals, or fields, at the overall rate of trillions of chemical reactions per second. To maintain balance and good health, the body's organs, tissues, and subsystems require precise communications to process these instantaneous exchanges effectively. When these critical communication exchanges are disrupted or blocked, the body's cells, tissues, and organs may be compromised, and unhealthy symptoms follow. How Does PEMF Therapy Work? Every organ in the body produces its signature bio-electromagnetic field. [CALM PEMF](https://drroseann.com/calmpemf/) works to alter those energy fields to enhance cellular functioning. Controlled and pulsed electromagnetic frequencies (PEMF) can deliver health-enhancing EMFs to the cells. Unfortunately, the environment, stressors, and toxins negatively impact people daily. Low-frequency PEMFs of even the weakest strengths pass through the body, penetrating every cell, tissue, organ, and bone without being absorbed or altered. [CALM PEMF](https://drroseann.com/calmpemf/) uses low-frequency energy fields that are pulsed. As they pass through, they stimulate electrical and chemical processes in the tissues. PEMF therapy benefits cellular energy, resulting in better cellular health and function. With PEMF therapy, the body can more efficiently process the electrical and chemical exchanges associated with those channels and address imbalances or dysfunctions in those areas - leading to improved adaptation and natural healing. What Are PEMF Therapy Side Effects? Side effects after a PEMF session are generally uncommon, with less than five percent of individuals experiencing any adverse effects. Some individuals may experience fatigue after a PEMF session due to the therapy's support of relaxation, but this side effect is typically temporary and resolves on its own. The most common source of side effects after a PEMF session is a detoxification effect or a \"herxing\" reaction, which occurs when the body begins to eliminate toxins or dead bacteria. While this is a sign that the therapy is working and the body is healing, it can cause discomfort or flu-like symptoms in some individuals. Supporting the body's detoxification process before or after sessions can alleviate these symptoms and promote healing. In rare cases, individuals with certain medical conditions or implanted medical devices may experience interference or adverse effects from PEMF therapy. It is always recommended to consult with a healthcare professional before starting PEMF therapy to discuss any potential risks or side effects and determine the most appropriate treatment approach for your individual needs and medical history. PEMF therapy is a safe and well-tolerated therapy that can enhance the body's natural healing processes and promote overall wellness. What Does the Research Say about PEMF? The therapeutic use of magnetic therapy is now well-established, with a growing number of double-blind placebo-controlled studies and many modalities now approved by the US FDA and regulatory bodies worldwide for pathologies such as bone repair, pain, inflammation, and chronic repair (Pilla, 2006). CALM PEMF employs very low-amplitude PEMF signals, which the literature supports the existence of bioeffects for PEMF (Milyaev Muehsam et al., 2009). What is CALM PEMF? The CALM PEMF device employs PEMF signals uniquely designed to couple with the body's vibrations, thus providing therapeutic benefits by enhancing the body's natural healing abilities. Through a unique customized program, CALM PEMF combines frequency, intensity, and signal modulation to stimulate the specific channels needed to support the natural electromagnetic activities of the body. Unlike other devices, CALM PEMF uses very specific frequencies aligned with symptoms related to mental wellness, including attention/learning, stress/anxiety, mood/behavior regulation, infections/toxins, and obsessions/compulsions. The CALM PEMF device sends signals to the cells to support these issues to improve mental wellness naturally and without side effects from psychiatric medications. PEMF works synergistically with various traditional and [holistic therapies](https://drroseann.com/24-holistic-remedies-chronic-conditions-healing-whole-person/), including nutrition, homeopathy, [neurofeedback](https://drroseann.com/httpcertify-bcia-org4dcgievents520-htmlactionconference_detailconfid_w520/), psychotherapy, OT, and PT. For example, it is common for a patient with addiction to use PEMF with Neurofeedback, naturopathic care, and psychotherapy. How CALM PEMF Helps Support Mental Wellness CALM PEMF supports the brain and body in many ways. After use, many notice the immediate benefit of feeling relaxed. The therapeutic goals of CALM PEMF are to: - accelerate healing - increase relaxation - help to balance energy - reduce [stress](https://drroseann.com/stress/)and muscle tension - improve [sleep quality](https://drroseann.com/sleep-problems/) - aid in circulation and blood oxygen level - improve digestion and the uptake of nutrients from the bloodstream to the cells - stimulate the immune system - help to dissipate allergies and hypersensitivities - support detoxification - help with muscle and joint aches - reduce inflammation - improve sports preparation, performance, and recovery - support efficient cell function and regeneration - reduce [anxiety](https://drroseann.com/anxiety-treatment/)and calms the mind - help to decrease therapy resistance and break through physical and emotional blocks - create synergies with other allopathic and integrative modalities to improve results What Symptoms or Conditions Does PEMF Help? Autoimmune illness and chronic disease states are on the rise. CALM PEMF is used to support a variety of conditions to aid the body in self-healing. At our office, we use CALM PEMF with individuals suffering from stand-alone issues like pain or depression, but we also use it with patients experiencing multiple issues simultaneously.
