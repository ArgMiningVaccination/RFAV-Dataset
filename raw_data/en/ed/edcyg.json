[Mental Health Services Monthly Statistics](/data-and-information/publications/statistical/mental-health-services-monthly-statistics) Mental Health Services Monthly Statistics: Final December 2016, Provisional January 2017Official statistics, Experimental statistics - Publication Date: - 21 Mar 2017 - Geographic Coverage: - England - Geographical Granularity: - Clinical Commissioning Groups, Councils with Adult Social Services Responsibilities (CASSRs), Independent Sector Health Care Providers, Provider, Mental Health Trusts, Regions, Ambulance Trusts, NHS Trusts, Clinical Commissioning Regions, Country - Date Range: - 01 Oct 2016 to 31 Dec 2016 Summary This release presents experimental statistics from the Mental Health Services Data Set (MHSDS). This replaces the Mental Health and Learning Disabilities Dataset (MHLDDS). As well as analysis of waiting times this release includes elements of the reports that were previously included in monthly reports produced from final MHLDDS submissions. It also includes some new measures. New measures are noted in the accompanying metadata file. The changes incorporate requirements in support of Children and Young People's Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (CYP IAPT), elements of the Learning Disabilities Census (LDC) and elements of the Assuring Transformation (AT) Information Standard. Information provided in this release therefore covers mental health, learning disability and autism services for all ages ('services'). From January 2016 the release includes information on people in children's and young people's mental health services, including CAMHS, for the first time. Learning disabilities and autism services have been included since September 2014. The expansion in the scope of the dataset means that many of the basic measures in this release now cover a wider set of services. We have introduced service level breakdowns for some measures to provide new information to users, but also, importantly, to provide comparability with key measures that were part of the previous monthly release. Full details of the measures included in this publication can be found in the Further information about this publication section of the executive summary. Because of the scope of the changes to the dataset it will take time to re-introduce all possible measures that were previously part of the MHLDS Monthly Reports. Additional measures will be added to this report in the coming months. Because the dataset is new these measures are currently experimental statistics. We will release the reports as experimental statistics until the characteristics of data flowed using the new data standard are understood. A correction has been made to this publication on 10 September 2018. This amendment relates to statistics in the monthly CSV data file; the specific measures effected are listed in the \"Corrected Measures\" CSV. All listed measures have now been corrected. NHS Digital apologises for any inconvenience caused.
