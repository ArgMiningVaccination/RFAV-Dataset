What is alternative medicine? Alternative care practitioners view the body holistically, rather than focusing on a single disease or condition. Alternative medicine is sometimes called \"complementary care\" because it can complement the ca re you receive from your regular medical physician or provider. Alternative medicine may be useful for co nditions such as headaches, backaches and chronic pain. It may offer an alternative for people who wish to avoid relying on medi cations to control pain. Many alternative care providers place a high priority on teaching their patients how to incorporate healthier habits into their lifestyles. Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese method of healing dating back to 1600 B.C. The acupuncturist inserts ultra-thin needles beneath the skin in a painless method designed to open \"energy pathways\" (known in China as ch'i) in the body. Many people turn to acupuncture for relief from conditions such as asthma, nausea, bronchitis, chronic pain, sports injuries and addictions . Acupuncturists are licensed (LAc ) health care providers. Chiropractic care seeks to achieve and preserve proper alignment of the spine, with the belief that this can have a substantial impact on one's overall sense of well-being. Chiropractic care is especia lly helpful in treating back pain, but also is often u sed in treating arthritis, infection, and other systemic diseases or conditions. Chiropractors hold a de gree of Doctor of Chiropractic (DC) and are licensed. Naturopathy draws on a number of methods to facilitate healing, which include massage, homeopathy, herbal therapy, nutrition and more. The naturopathic physici an incorporates natural therapies into his or her practice, using an extensive personal medical history of the patient to help guide each diagnosis and recommendation for treatment. Naturopathy can be especially useful for people who want to improve their overa ll health. Naturopathic physicians hold a degree of Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (ND). How do I use the alternative care benefit? When you feel that you need services from an alternative care provider, you must receive care from a licensed alternative care provider. Pay your $15 copay to your alternative care provider at the ti me of service. That is your complete out-of-pocket charge for covered services, up to a maximum benefit of $1,500 per member a nnually. You do not need to meet any applicable medical plan deductibles before receiving this benefit. Submitting claims: Many health care providers will bi ll your insurance company for you. Please be sure to show your member identification card to your provider . If your provider does not bill the Plan directly, request an itemized bill suitabl e for insurance purposes.
