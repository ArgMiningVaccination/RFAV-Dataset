So read on, and we'll tell you the steps you can take to fix a hormonal imbalance. Plus, we've rounded up the best foods and the best hormone support supplements to help you regain the balance. What is hormonal imbalance? Too much or too little hormone in your bloodstream creates a hormonal imbalance. Hormones have an essential role: They're the messengers within the body that tell your organs and tissues how to function. Humans house 50 types of hormones, but we're going to focus on estrogen and progesterone. When a hormonal imbalance occurs, this means the endocrine glands aren't working, shifting estrogen and progesterone levels. (Endocrine glands are cells that produce, store, and release hormones into the bloodstream.) Therefore, if you have an imbalance, your organs and tissues can't compute the message of how they're supposed to work. This causes side effects throughout the body. Just like when you and your partner don't communicate your problems, hormonal imbalance sends the whole dynamic out of whack. What causes hormonal imbalance? Since a hormonal imbalance in women is so common, there are many possible causes for it. Some include: - Eating disorders - Poor diet - Being overweight - Stress - Injury/trauma - Exposure to toxins, pollutants, or chemicals (pesticides and herbicides) Some medical conditions that cause it: - PCOS - Cancer - Diabetes - Hypothyroidism/Hyperthyroidism - Other endocrine disorders How to know if you have hormonal imbalance Women experience the effects of hormonal imbalance from their teenage years to their 40s. Oftentimes, they aren't even aware of it. Here are some signs of hormonal imbalance to look out for: Hormonal imbalance symptoms - Irregular menstrual cycles (a menstrual cycle is anywhere between 21 and 35 days. If yours is any shorter or longer than that, your hormones are likely unbalanced) - Heavy periods - Weight gain - Fatigue - Hot flashes and night sweats - PMS - Mood swings - Insomnia - Depression - Acne - Hair loss - Low libido - Infertility (read [this](https://www.premamawellness.com/blogs/blog/how-to-increase-fertility-in-women)for ways to increase fertility) Hormone balance tests The safest way to check if you have a hormonal imbalance is by booking an appointment with your doctor. Depending on your symptoms, they might send you for a blood test, ultrasound, or pap smear. You can also take matters into your own hands by ordering an at-home hormone test. Thyroid tests, female hormone level tests, and cortisol tests are available for sale.

All these vegetables contain a chemical called Indole-3-carbinol (I3C), which breaks down estrogen and promotes liver function to detox extra estrogen. 2. Flaxseed As a phytoestrogen, flax seeds regulate hormones by [aiding in digestion](https://drkathleenmahannah.com/blog/top-5-foods-for-hormone-balance). They make sure that excess estrogen goes down the toilet \u2014 literally. Flax seeds [can also help regulate menstrual cycles](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8077314/). 3.

[High in beta-sitosterol](https://www.newsweek.com/amplify/how-know-if-you-are-suffering-hormonal-imbalance-5-foods-help-you-fix-it), avocados can control cortisol (the stress hormone).

Best supplements for hormone balance While eating hormone balancing foods certainly promotes hormone balance, you still might not be getting all the nutrients you need. The only way to ensure you're consistently balancing hormones is by taking female hormone balance supplements. Supplements are also an easy way to control symptoms of hormonal imbalance, like relieving PMS, painful periods, acne, and more. But before starting to use any of these supplements, it's important to consider your personal hormonal imbalances, symptoms, and needs. Also, be sure to ask your doctor before adding new supplements, especially if you are pregnant, nursing or have another condition. So what supplements are good for balancing hormones? Here are the 10 best hormone balance supplements you should take. Magnesium Taking magnesium for hormone balance regulates cortisol (the stress hormone) and estrogen while producing testosterone and increasing DHEA and serotonin. The [recommended daily allowance](https://hormonesbalance.com/articles/boost-magnesium-levels-to-rebalance-your-hormones/) for magnesium is 320mgs per day. Vitamin D According to a study in [the journal Nutrition Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21310306), 41% of Americans are vitamin D deficient. This is especially true in the wintertime as we primarily get vitamin D from the sun. As a hormone in itself, vitamin D can aid in estrogen imbalance. So if your body isn't producing enough estrogen (causing depression, hot flashes, mood swings), you need to try taking vitamin D. Diindolymethyl (DIM) If you don't want to eat broccoli or cauliflower to help your hormonal imbalance, you should take Diindolymethyl (DIM) supplements. Made of cruciferous vegetables, DIM hormone balance supplements are often used to help women with elevated estrogen levels. DHEA Although the body produces DHEA hormone naturally, you need to make sure you have a lot in your system. DHEA is the most prevalent hormone in your body and affects all your other hormones. If you have low levels of DHEA, your body will struggle to make enough of your other hormones. Therefore, you'll need to take a DHEA supplement to fix and prevent a hormonal imbalance. Probiotics Gut bacteria break down hormones and remove them from your blood. There's a microbiome in the gut called [estrobolome](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28778332/), which regulates estrogen. If it becomes unbalanced, it can cause Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome. [Studies have shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4836746/) that probiotics improve the estrogen cycle in the gut microbiome in rats with this condition. The gut is also responsible for ensuring we're absorbing nutrients and supplements properly. Since nutrient deficiencies are often the underlying cause of hormonal imbalance, we need to take probiotic supplements to replenish bacteria. Maca Maca root is an excellent herbal remedy for hormonal imbalance. Taking maca root for hormone balance helps regulate menstrual cycles and is [proven to relieve symptoms of menopause](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23674952/). Maca, a sweet root from Peru, also has the following [hormonal benefits](https://hormonesbalance.com/articles/the-10-hormone-balancing-wonders-of-maca/): - Clearer mind/better memory - Balances mood - Improves PMS - Helps with fertility - Gives you more energy Be careful though: maca can make some women feel sick. Make sure the maca supplement contains pure maca and that you take it on a full stomach. Chaste Tree This traditional herbal supplement is a great choice for women with high estrogen/low progesterone. Chaste tree supplements target the pituitary gland to increase the luteinizing hormone (LH) and progesterone and stimulate ovulation. It also works to alleviate symptoms of PMS. Licorice root Licorice root is one of the best herbs for hormone balance because it lowers testosterone. It makes it a great supplement for those with PCOS, PMS, and menopause. Licorice root also curbs sugar cravings. As you read above, sugar can further irritate those with hormonal imbalance. So it's a great way to keep symptoms at bay. Indium Indium has been called a \" [miracle element](https://www.tucsonbiofeedback.com/indum/)\" because it balances out 23 of the 24 hormonal systems in the body. Unfortunately, our bodies don't produce indium past the age of 25, so it's important to take a supplement to balance hormones.
