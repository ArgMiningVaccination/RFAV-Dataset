First, we remove the things that remind us of them because there is no need to cling to a toxic or unnecessary past. I'm not sure about you, but something about [getting rid of clutter](https://www.xonecole.com/consider-spring-cleaning-your-relationship/) that weighed me down is so refreshing; I rebuke all negative energy in my personal space. Next, we cleanse ourselves by taking a natural, detoxifying bath or journal to release those emotions safely and effectively. However, what do you do when it comes to spiritually [detoxing yourself](https://www.xonecole.com/spiritual-bath-ritual/)? Can you recognize when it is time for something like that? Detoxes concentrate on drawing out bad toxins and energies and realigning us with our purpose. Usually, when my energy is low, or I experience constant uneasiness, I know I need to take steps to detox spiritually. Luckily, I remembered a Reiki healer who worked with a close friend years ago; therefore, I started there. I checked in with Reiki Practitioner Tamara Angela ( [@loveandfaerymagic](https://www.instagram.com/loveandfaerymagic/)) for her top ten recommendations on how to spiritually detox. I appreciate Tamara's advice because she uses Reiki as \"maintenance, not crisis [management],\" thus, helping me realize I can prevent \"spiritual clutter\" from progressing. Reiki practitioner Tamara Angela Photo courtesy of Tamara Angela According to Tamara, \"Reiki is a Japanese [healing](https://www.xonecole.com/signs-you-re-healing-from-breakup/?utm_campaign=SmartLinks) art. It [Reiki] comes with the understanding that we are all energy. And the way I describe it is Reiki covers you like your grandma's prayer.\" And we all know how vital our grandmother's (or elders') prayers are, especially growing up. Ways To Spiritually Detox Tamara explained that her nine steps all work together and [detoxify your spirit](https://www.xonecole.com/types-of-spiritual-practices/mindfulness) and help you maintain the work you put into cleansing your spirit. We apply many of these steps to our daily routine, not realizing how crucial they are for our spiritual health. Each step ties into the other, and all are necessary. When you do a spiritual detox it's important to remember, it's a lifestyle. Start slowly to create the level of peace you want and build the stability you need. Tamara shares, \"You can do all nine steps and still experience chaos. That is why it is important to have a baseline, a level of peace,\" Tamara says. \"You have to create a baseline of stability that you can revert back to. 'I am used to this level of peace.' Someone came along to disturb it, and now I have to fix it. Now, I can come back to these [steps] and remove that energy and know how to properly.\" 1. Turn off your phone notifications and alerts. Those [notifications](https://www.xonecole.com/why-a-digital-detox-is-what-you-deserve-this-holiday-season/) keep you tethered to constantly looking out for things (i.e. a text from that one person you should have kept blocked), thus, making it harder to calm your spirits. \"Instead, choose a time in the day when you're checking notifications,\" Tamara recommended. 2. Get proper rest. We experience different levels of [sleep](https://www.xonecole.com/simple-ways-to-improve-sleep/), and getting proper [rest](https://www.xonecole.com/high-functioning-anxiety-black-women/) allows your body to reset. Raise your hand if your off day consists of running multiple errands. Often, we do not rest on our off days; \"something\" comes up. That \"something\" can be as simple as your favorite reality show. Feel seen yet? I surely did. Sitting down and binge-watching a TV show does not allow your mind to rest effectively. For proper rest, Tamara suggested that classical and jazz music or white noise is okay, but nothing with lyrics. 3. Clear and calm your nervous system When you are constantly experiencing things, sometimes you need to calm your mind down. For example, when something goes wrong with the Wi-Fi, we reset the modem. We should do the same when it comes to our bodies. Unfortunately, we tend to not think like that regarding our body and nervous system. \"We are in a constant sensory experience,\" Tamara explained. \"You have six senses. That is how you experience the world. So, when you are constantly experiencing things, sometimes you need to calm down. Sometimes you need to remove something. Sometimes you need to be aware of how much you have taken in or have the capacity to take in.\" According to [Apollo Neuro](https://apolloneuro.com/blogs/news/the-art-science-of-self-soothing-how-to-calm-your-overactive-nervous-system#:~:text=An%20overactive%20sympathetic%20nervous%20system,signal%20parasympathetic%20dominance%20%5B3%5D.), an overactive sympathetic nervous system can cause issues like muscle tension, jitters, insomnia, etc. It can also lead to hyper-vigilance, the tendency to detect danger, even in its absence. By contrast, excessive tiredness, depression, and an overactive gag reflex can signal parasympathetic dominance. Fortunately, steps eight and nine emphasize easing an overactive nervous system. 4. Enjoy the company of good friends with laughter \"Laughter is a way to express emotion; it's a [great release.](https://www.xonecole.com/black-girl-s-healing-house-founder-schools-us-on-the-soft-life/) You are not in an inadequate space when you're there [with friends].\" As we know, laughter is good for the soul; it releases endorphins and helps you release things. 5. Purge your living space/get rid of clutter Also known as \" [spring cleaning](https://www.xonecole.com/spring-clean-your-digital-space/).\" Constant mess or clutter is draining, and cleaning removes that negative energy. A great example Tamara uses is opening a window as it \"can let out negative, stagnant energy. Many people do not realize that this practice is hoodoo-based.\" 6. Unplug Completely unplug or pick a day or time, and [unplug](https://www.xonecole.com/spring-clean-your-digital-space/). One way to do this is by turning off your phone. You cannot scroll through social media, talk on the phone, etc. Tamara recommended starting with 15 minutes and progressing from there. 7. Set boundaries My personal favorite as I've gotten older. From a former people-pleaser, this is not an easy task. A lot of the pleasing we wrap ourselves up in is one of the main reasons we are spiritually drained. [Setting boundaries](https://www.xonecole.com/setting-boundaries-with-toxic-family/) is healthy; do things are your terms. 8. Do some Reiki \"Reiki energy balancing allows you to center yourself and clear that [negative] energy,\" Tamara said. She further explained that it's like a church mother \"laying hands on you.\" Reiki is an energy healing technique that promotes relaxation and [reduces stress](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/stress-relief-for-overwhelmed-women/) and anxiety through gentle touch. Reiki practitioners use their hands to deliver energy to your body, improving the flow and balance of your energy to support healing. Reiki practitioners are a conduit between you and the universal life force energy source. The energy flows through the practitioner's hands to you. However, your Reiki healer does not always have to touch you for Reiki to work physically. \"You can receive Reiki healing from long distances, like on the phone,\" Tamara said. Instead, clients experience the energy through heat, cold, tingling, or pulsing sensations. There are many benefits to Reiki. Reiki can: - Promote relaxation, stress reduction, and symptom relief to improve overall health and well-being. - Bring on a meditative state. - Foster tissue and bone healing after injury or surgery. - Stimulate your body's immune system. - Promote natural self-healing. - Relieve pain and tension. 9. Breath/breathwork \"Breathwork is extremely helpful in moving any stagnant energy,\" and that is why Tamara gives the people she works with a two-minute [meditation](https://www.xonecole.com/daily-meditation-career/) that consists of breathwork. One [breathwork](https://www.xonecole.com/self-touch-breathwork-practice/) exercise is placing your hand on your heart and feeling the movement of your heartbeat. Doing this technique for two minutes will recenter you and can be performed anywhere - office cubicle, home, etc. Even a deep belly breath, hold, then release is a great way to release stuck emotions. \"The process of inhaling brings in what we need, and that full exhale is letting go of what we do not [need],\" Tamara said.

[Sex](https://www.xonecole.com/sex/) [ Worth The Wait: 10 Virgins Reveal Why They Are Waiting Until It's...Right ](https://www.xonecole.com/virgins-waiting-to-have-sex/) As much as I [talk about sex](https://www.xonecole.com/health-benefits-orgasm-for-women/), this is a topic that I was excited to shed a spotlight on. Why? It's simple, really. Despite how sexed \u2014 and sometimes it really does seem oversexed \u2014 that our culture and society may be, [virgins](https://www.xonecole.com/sex-tips-virgins-wedding-night/) are not extinct. Believe it or not, it's been reported that around [ 27 percent of guys](https://datepsychology.com/are-27-of-young-men-really-virgins-and-why/) are still virgins when they first step foot on a college campus (as a freshman) and, globally, approximately [ 38 percent of people](https://insights.paramount.com/post/around-the-world-casual-sex-isnt-all-that-common/) between the ages of 18-24 are still virgins too. And even though it's not a ton of 'em, there are [ still some virgins](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/03/on-late-in-life-virginity-loss/284412/) who are over 40 (I personally know three, although they declined to be interviewed for this article). And even though it really does seem like, over the past 50-60 years or so, virginity has been looked at as something that should be ridiculed, side-eyed, or even flat-out dismissed, I don't feel that way at all. [Fourteen sex partners](https://www.xonecole.com/every-single-guy-ive-slept-with-taught-me-something-new-sexually-and-emotionally/) and many lessons later, I actually get that there are many perks that come with waiting. Not only that, but I've encountered enough virgins in my time to get that, like most things in life, virginity is not a monolith, there are tons of reasons why people choose not to have sex until later in life and, if there's one thing that you can't really \"do over\" (because no, there is no such thing as a \" [born-again virgin](https://www.xonecole.com/ive-been-trying-to-be-celibate-for-years-this-is-attempt-number-329/).\" You lose your virginity ONCE) is \"losing\" your virginity (I prefer to say \"giving.\" You know where it is)\u2014 being careful and even uber-cautious about how and when your first time goes down is something that I very much so respect. You don't have to take my word for it, though. As someone who gave my \"conscious virginity\" (I am a survivor of molestation, which is why I put it that way) at 19, I wanted to hear from women of that age and older who still haven't \"partaken of the fruit\" just yet. First, to give their journey a voice and second, to remind others who may not be so vocal about their own virginal sexual status that, no matter what social media may be yapping about, when it comes to the topic of virginity, they are certainly not alone \u2014 and there is definitely nothing to be ashamed of or embarrassed about. *Per usual, when it comes to these types of interviews that I conduct, middle names have been used.* [Giphy](https://giphy.com/gifs/celeb-BRhYAwGzMiCZi) Lynn. 27. \"It's not like I planned to be this age and still a virgin. When I was in high school, I thought I would be married by now. I'm not, and that's why I'm still a virgin. Does this mean I'm [waiting until marriage](https://www.xonecole.com/truths-about-being-celibate/)? I am. I don't see the point in giving some man my all without that level of commitment. I personally admire women who can because I don't have the emotional strength or mental stamina to go through that kind of stress or pain \u2014 especially multiple times. I just think there is already enough to worry about in life than if I'm gonna get an STD, get pregnant by someone I don't want to deal with for the rest of my life, or even if some man is going to call the next day. \"And before y'all even start \u2014 yes, I know that marriage comes with risks too. But if a man is willing to pledge his life to me and sign a legal contract to prove it just to get some, I'd rather go that route than some dude I met at a club or a guy who I dated for a couple of months, and it didn't work out. To each their own, and this is the way that I choose to do it.\" Eileen. 22. \"I've always been called an old soul. I don't think that 22 is old, but it is old, these days, to be a virgin. Some people assume that I'm one for religious reasons. Really, it's because I'm observant, and my sisters and friends who already gave it up usually had more drama in their lives than anything. I just want my first time to be with someone who, when I look back on it, I don't have regrets. I'm not looking for the perfect guy, but damn, can he at least not ghost me, give me an orgasm, and keep the moment to himself instead of telling all of his boys? I don't think that's too much to ask \u2014 and if it is...oh well.\" [Giphy](https://giphy.com/gifs/owntv-reaction-love-abstinent-C2Eft7zj0b5M18HTPR) Iris. 21. \"The question I get asked all of the time is if I'm [saving it for marriage](https://www.xonecole.com/yvonne-orji-saving-herself/). I am. I used to say that I was waiting until I got engaged or at least fell in love, but I have friends who did that, and months after they had sex, the guys were gone. I know that marriage doesn't guarantee anything, but I have some other friends who were [virgins on their wedding night](https://www.xonecole.com/sex-tips-virgins-wedding-night/), and their lives just seem to be less intense. \"Not having sex has shown the true colors and real agendas of a lot of guys, so while it does get lonely, being this way makes it easier to see who is serious about a relationship and who just wants to get their d \u2014 k wet. Virginity can be the ultimate male marriage material predictor. At least it's been that way for me.\" Kya. 20. \"I almost gave it up to my first love, and 'he' didn't happen until college. The break-up damn near turned me into a basket case, so that proved to me that I'm not really for a sexual relationship. I think the best way to explain it is, until I know that I can emotionally handle giving myself to someone and it possibly not working out, I need to stay just where I'm at...and I'm just not there yet.\" [Giphy](https://giphy.com/gifs/bollywood-virgin-im-a-l0ErSjVQgGADBQ6Wc) Ruth. 19. \"The timing of this is crazy because I almost lost my virginity last weekend. It's a long story, but I was going to [give it to a guy friend](https://www.xonecole.com/should-you-have-sex-with-your-guy-friend/) because I want my first time to be with someone who I trust. We didn't go through with it because he said that he didn't want to chance me regretting it and it ruining our friendship. I think it's interesting that it seems that men value a woman's virginity more than women do these days. Anyway, all I know is it won't be just some random guy. If I don't trust you with my heart, you will never be able to have my body. My standard will definitely be someone who was my friend first.\" Sherelle. 27. \"I've been too busy to give up my virginity. Sounds crazy, but it's still the truth. I've always been very career-driven, so after getting my master's, I decided to do a lot of traveling and then buy a home. It's probably been over the past few months that my sexual status has even crossed my mind because dating just hasn't been a priority. \"I guess you can say that having a full life is why I'm a virgin. When I can fit a man into my schedule, and I find him just as stimulating as what I currently have going on, I can almost assure you that my sexual status will change. Until then...stamps on the passport are my orgasms.\" [Giphy](https://giphy.com/gifs/cbs-bob-hearts-abishola-bobheartsabishola-toni-danner-iDf8J0MFHAAHGC0nuY) Vada. 23. \"I've had plenty of [oral sex](https://www.xonecole.com/how-to-give-better-oral-sex/) \u2014 not giving, receiving. Some people say that, technically, I'm not a virgin anymore, but I guess I'll speak for the women who fall into my special situation. The reason why I've never gone down on a guy is because I want that to be reserved for the one [who] I first have intercourse with. The reason why several have gone down on me? You know how guys are \u2014 they see virginity as a challenge and will go the distance to be the first. If they wanna try, who am I to stop them? \"As far as what I'm waiting on...I don't really see it as 'waiting.' I am open to it. I just haven't been with someone who seems like he is who I should give it to. I think that the guy who never brings sex up will probably be the one who piques my interest. I'm already a challenge. I think I'm looking for someone who is one, too.\" Aleena. 19. \"I'm a virgin because I'm focused. There are too many women at my school who are so distracted because of what some guy is doing or didn't do \u2014 and I don't have the time. I want to be able to have my master's degree before my 23rd birthday, and I'm on the way to making that happen. I haven't told anyone this, but the present I want to give myself is [losing my virginity](https://www.xonecole.com/my-prayer-for-clarity-saved-me-from-losing-my-virgnity/) for graduation. I think an orgasm for all of my hard work makes sense. I know who I want the guy to be, too. He doesn't know. Hope he doesn't blow it. I'll try to keep you posted.\" [Giphy](https://giphy.com/gifs/vh1-basketball-wives-3og0Ivv1Ia8LpChxRK) Payge. 31. \"All of the holy books value virginity, and that's why you will never be able to convince me that there is not a serious spiritual breakdown in our society. What used to be respected is now a so-called social construct, and to me, that sounds like so many people are so hyper-sexed with no real reason or purpose that they want to take the 'misery loves company' approach \u2014 that because they weren't taught to value virtue and virginity, they want as many other people as possible to follow suit. That will never be me. Until I meet the man who is deserving of being the first and only to enter into my body and spirit, I will remain a virgin and very proud of it.\" Ella. 36. \"I honestly don't know why I'm still a virgin. Remember how you told me [Shellie] that after the first couple of years of [abstinence](https://www.xonecole.com/how-to-be-abstinent-celibate/), you got pickier and pickier? That's the way I've been all of my life. I'm sure that sex is amazing, but it's also complicated, physically kind of messy, and exposes you to a world of stuff that you don't have to think about when you're a virgin. I'm not scared to have sex, but I'm not in a rush. Look at me \u2014 I'm sure I'll open these legs up one day, but I'm not checking off the calendar or anything. When I have room to explore the good and bad of sex, I'll be more aggressive about it.\" ____ There you have it \u2014 proof that there are at least ten virgins on the planet who aren't still in high school. And what I like about each of them is there is both a confidence and focus outside of their sexual status that serves as a great reminder that sex is a part of who we are yet...it's certainly not everything. And you know what? It never was designed to be. So yes, kudos to them for having a personal type of conviction, for whatever the reason, and standing by it. Virgins or not, it's a reminder that we all should be firm in our standards about...something. Amen? 1000 percent. Let's make things inbox official!
