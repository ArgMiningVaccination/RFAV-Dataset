Little is known about factors that motivate patients to disclose supplement use. The study aimed to identify reported factors motivating patients' dis-closure and nondisclosure of dietary supplement use and explore differences based on type of supplement and pro-vider practice. Methods: Mixed methods study combining qualitative con - tent analysis of semi-structured interviews with statistical analyses to assess differences in identified factors by pro-vider practice type and supplement type. Seventy-eight English-speaking patients who reported taking 466 dietary supplements in the previous 30 days were recruited from primary care and Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM), and Integrative Medicine (IM) offices in Southern California. Results: We identified nine themes related to disclosure and nine related to nondisclosure of dietary supplement use. Major themes were features of the office visit, circum-stances in patient health and medical care, and provider/pa - tient characteristics. The most commonly raised theme pro-moting disclosure of supplement use was provider inquiry. Patients associate disclosure with having concerns about a supplement but also with annual physical exams and some routine topics of discussion, including self-care, lab results,and new medication prescriptions. Themes related to non-disclosure included lack of provider inquiry, features of the office visit, such as supplements being unrelated to the vis-it purpose, and patients' convictions that supplements are safe or not important to discuss. Themes did not vary by supplement type. Primary care patients were more likely than CAM/IM patients to attribute nondisclosure to convic-tions that supplements were beneficial, not worth mention - ing, or equivalent to food (p 0.001). Conclusions: When providers fail to ask directly about dietary supplement use, disclosure is often an impromptu decision that is driven by the content of provider-patient in-teractions. Ensuring disclosure of dietary supplement use to prevent potential drug-supplement interactions or adverse health outcomes likely requires consistent, proactive pro-vider queries about supplement use.

J Fam Med Dis Prev 2019, 5:109 Page 2 of 11 Methods Design The data are from a larger study concerning provid- er-patient communication about dietary supplements [43]. Between November 2011 and May 2013, 603 pa- tients were recruited from 61 participating provider waiting rooms (32 primary care physicians from aca-demic, community health, and managed care practices, 14 integrative medicine physicians from academic and private practices, and 15 CAM providers - 5 naturopaths, 5 acupuncturists, 5 chiropractors). Eligible patients were English- or Spanish-speaking, at least 18 years old, and available to participate in a follow-up interview within one week of an audio-recorded office visit. Participants completed surveys about demographics and supple-ment use. Among 477 of the 603 patients who reported taking dietary supplements in the past 30 days, 126 were pur- posively sampled for interviews based on practice type and supplement disclosure during their office visit. Eight of the 126 patients could not be reached, and one de-cided not to participate. Our analyses focused on 78 En - glish-language interviews with patients of primary care and IM physicians and naturopathic physicians who held Naturopathic Doctor (ND) degrees. Since these provid - ers all practice primary care [44-47], they may be more likely to solicit complete medication and supplement information than chiropractors and acupuncturists, who most frequently consult about more focused com- plaints [48-50]. Patients received a $25 gift card upon interview completion. The Institutional Review Boards of the University of California, Los Angeles and Kaiser Permanente approved the study protocol. Trained and experienced interviewers--a medical an - thropologist (JRG) and a medical linguist--conducted all patient interviews via telephone. Interviewers used one of two semi-structured interview guides [51] con - taining slightly different questions for interviewees who did and did not disclose supplement use during the recorded visit. Dietary supplements were defined for interviewees as \"vitamins, minerals, and herbal sup - plements\" [52]. We asked interviewees who disclosed supplement use about the circumstances and content of their discussions and their reactions to them (Table 1). Interviewees reporting nondisclosure were asked why, and what circumstances could have prompted dis - closure. We asked all interviewees who should initiate discussions and when disclosure is necessary/unneces - sary. We used follow-up probes [53] for clarification as needed. Interviews lasted an average of 29.7 (SD = 9.2) minutes and were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Categorization of supplements Every supplement mentioned in the interviews was categorized into: (1) Supplements commonly recom -etary supplements, among whom 12% report using five or more products [4 ]. Concurrent use with prescription medications is high [6 ,9,11]. Some supplements may pro- vide health benefits [12- 14]. However, supplement use can result in serious adverse health outcomes such as renal and liver injury [7 ,15-24], particularly for patients with pre-existing liver or kidney disease [7 ,19]. Studies have shown that while rare, the most serious supple - ment-drug interactions can result in renal and liver toxic-ity, cardiotoxicity, cardiovascular collapse, hypovolemic shock, and even death [21- 23]. Because of such risks, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that patients consult with a healthcare professional before using supplements [25]. However, most patients take dietary supplements on their own, and infrequently dis- close their use to healthcare providers [7 ,26-37]. Numerous studies have identified factors associat - ed with nondisclosure of supplement use to conven- tional medical providers. Patients are less likely to dis - close if a provider does not ask about supplement use [29,36,38,39] or when they perceive time constraints [27,29,36]. Patients also report nondisclosure when they feel their provider is disinterested, unreceptive, or unknowledgeable about supplements [26, 27,29,36,38- 41], or may disapprove or respond negatively to supple - ment use [26, 27,29,36,38,40,41]. Others do not disclose because they feel it is unimportant [27, 36,38,39] or that they already have the information they need [27]. Comparatively less is known about the circumstanc- es that prompt patient disclosure of dietary supplement use. Conventional physicians' queries about supplement use are associated with disclosure [27]. And patients are more likely to disclose Complementary and Alter - native Medicine (CAM) use, including dietary supple - ments, if a professional recommended the supplement [42], if it was used to treat a medical condition [42], or if patients believed the provider was knowledgeable or open-minded about CAM [26,30, 38]. Disclosure may also be motivated by the belief that disclosure is import - ant for safety or to help others with the same condition [30]. The research literature lacks information about the specific reasons patients disclose dietary supplement use during a given office visit, and whether the types of supplements patients are taking influence whether they disclose their use. Patient reasons for disclosing or not disclosing to CAM/Integrative Medicine (IM) prac- titioners have not been studied at all. This study aims to (1) Explore patient reasons for disclosure and non - disclosure of dietary supplement use during a particu- lar outpatient office visit, as well as generally, and (2) Determine whether those reasons vary by supplement type or provider specialty (conventional primary care versus CAM/IM doctors).ISSN: 2469-5793DOI: 10.23937/2469-5793/1510109 Guzman et al. J Fam Med Dis Prev 2019, 5:109 Page 3 of 11 Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.1. Summary statistics, including means and percentages, were calculated to describe participants' characteristics. We used generalized linear mixed mod - els to examine the relationship of themes identified through our qualitative analysis of the interviews on patient disclosure or nondisclosure of individual dietary supplements. Generalized linear mixed models were selected because they allow us to control for the pos - sible correlation of behaviors within patients. For this analysis, any patient mention of a theme pertaining to disclosure or nondisclosure of dietary supplement use counted as fulfillment of the theme. We also used gen-eralized linear mixed models to assess differences in mentions of themes related to dietary supplement disclosures and nondisclosures by practice types (con - ventional primary care versus integrative/naturopathic) and supplement type (supplements commonly recom - mended by primary care providers; multivitamins and multiminerals; all other vitamins and minerals; and NVNM). Results Patient and supplement characteristics Of the 78 patients in the study, 45 were primary care, 23 were IM, and 10 were naturopathic patients. Patients were predominantly white, female, and high - ly educated. Compared to integrative and naturopathic patients, primary care patients had significantly lower educational achievement (p = 0.02) and were younger and more ethnically diverse (though these differences were not statistically significant) (Table 2). Forty partic-ipants (51.2%) reported disclosing at least one supple - ment to their provider during their office visit. Patients discussed between one and 18 supplements during their interviews (mean 6.0, SD = 3.7), and a total of 466 supplements across all interviews (39 multivitamin/ multi-minerals, 101 supplements commonly recommend - ed by primary care providers, 104 other vitamin/miner - al supplements, and 222 NVNM). Of these, interviewees reported disclosing 156 (33%) to their provider.mended by primary care providers (i.e. calcium, vita- min D, fish oil/omega-3, folic acid, and glucosamine with/without chondroitin or methylsulfonylmethane), (3) All other vitamins/minerals, (4) Non-vitamins, non-minerals (NVNM) and (5) General, a category to capture comments interview-ees made about disclosure and nondisclosure of supple - ments, regardless of type. The fifth category included cases where interviewees talked about circumstanc-es in which they considered disclosure necessary or un - necessary. Our determination of disclosure or nondis - closure of each supplement was based on interviewee report during the interview. Qualitative analysis Each interview transcript was verified for accuracy prior to analysis. Two coders, a practicing primary care physician with research expertise in provider-patient communication (DMT) and a medical anthropologist (JRG), conducted inductive content analysis [54] on a subset of interviews, (1) Identifying themes related to disclosure or nondisclosure of each supplement inter-viewees were taking and of supplements in general and (2) Categorizing themes and subthemes. A medical so-ciologist with expertise in qualitative methods (DAP) re - viewed a partially overlapping set of transcripts and an additional set of transcripts for validity of coding. They also worked together to finalize the coding scheme and develop a codebook defining each theme. One investigator (JRG) coded all interviews, one of the other two investigators double-coded 20 interviews (26%), and all three investigators coded six interviews (8%). Multiple investigators coded at least 10% of the interviews from each practice type. Throughout the coding process, the investigators iteratively reviewed the coding scheme and incorporated new themes until saturation was reached [55]. Coding discrepancies be-tween auditors were discussed and resolved by group consensus with consideration of the decision's rele - vance to clinical practice. Atlas.ti 7 (Scientific Software Development, Berlin, Germany) was employed for sys- tematically storing, coding, retrieving, and reviewing coded data.Table 1: Selected guiding questions for interview.

A minority of interviewees said disclosure is necessary when patients have medical conditions (\"I have a lot of medical problems, so I always, every time I see her, I just kind of put her up to date\" (838)). Finally, interviewees occasionally cited provider and patient characteristics. Several noted that provider char- acteristics like expertise/knowledgeability or receptive - ness to discussing supplements gave them confidence to disclose. A few interviewees conveyed personal con- victions about the importance of disclosure. Themes promoting nondisclosure: Most interview - ees invoked multiple themes concerning nondisclo - sure. Numerous interviewees attributed nondisclosure to interaction during the visit , specifically the topic not coming up. Frequently mentioned visit characteristics associated with nondisclosure include when supple - ments are unrelated to the visit's purpose, when there are competing demands or time constraints, or when they thought the visit type did not warrant disclosure (i.e. follow-up and acute care visits). Nondisclosure was also attributed to organizational or procedural factors: when the patient is unprepared to discuss supplement use or believes the provider already knows about their supplement use. Nondisclosure was often associated with the circum- stances of supplement use: sporadic use, long duration of use, or use of a supplement considered to be safe. One patient taking Coenzyme Q10 noted \"I thought that's very safe to take, and so I didn't discuss it with my doctor\" (565). For others, good health or fitness (medical condition ) made discussion unnecessary (e.g., \"I wouldn't really feel the need to tell him because I'm in relatively good shape\" (151)). According to some interviewees, provider charac- teristics militated against disclosure: lack of relevant expertise, unreceptiveness to supplement discussions, and prejudice against supplements. Others attributed Themes promoting disclosure and nondisclosure We identified twelve major themes related to dis - closure/nondisclosure (Table 3), which spanned three domains: features of the office visit, patient health and medical care circumstances, and provider and patient characteristics. Interviewees mentioned six themes in relation to both disclosure and nondisclosure three in relation to disclosure only, and three in relation to non - disclosure only. Themes promoting disclosure: The themes related to disclosure that emerged most frequently were re - lated to features of the office visit. Many interviewees attributed their disclosure of supplement use to interac- tion during the visit, specifically provider inquiries. For example, \"Doctor [surname] asked what supplements I take, and I just mentioned that I take that for heart and skin health\" (688). Unprompted disclosures were most often attributed to discussion topics pertinent to supplement use, e.g. patient self-care and laboratory results. As one interviewee explained, \"When he was asking me about sleep, I immediately mentioned that I had been using the melatonin\" (234). Occasionally, interviewees associated visit characteristics with dis - closure, i.e. pre-surgery visits, physical examinations, or new patient visits. Many interviewees associated aspects of patient health and medical care circumstances with disclosure. Having concerns about a supplement, including per- ceived or feared side effects and questions about safe-ty, commonly emerged. Few reported actual concerns, but many said they would disclose if they had them, or to get advice. Some interviewees said patients should disclose when taking unusual or multiple supplements, mega-dosing, or changing a supplement regimen (cir-cumstances of supplement use). Many interviewees believed that disclosure was important under medica- tion-related circumstances; for example, \"It needs to be brought up any time that there's going to be a prescrip-ISSN: 2469-5793DOI: 10.23937/2469-5793/1510109 Guzman et al.

Provider inquiry about what a patient is taking (705): She asked me what I take daily, and I told her. (671): They always want to know what you are taking besides your medication. Provider didn't ask about supplement use (187): He didn't specifically ask.(688): Any time they don't ask [disclosure is unnecessary]. Topic didn't come up(198): It just never comes up. I mean, you're talking about a subject that just never, never, never comes up. (448): It [supplements] just didn't come up. Discussion topicSelf-care (691): I had not been feeling well, and I said that I had used my herbal remedies, which was Vitamin C and Echinacea. (708): I mentioned that I was taking these [supplements] in addition to staying away from various foods. Lab results (802): We were itemizing the chem panel... and I started telling her, \"Well, I take - I already take a multi.\" (560): I was taking a supplement called Coenzyme-A...and it really, really skewed one of my lab results...and I mentioned, \"These are what I'm taking\". Visit characteristicsBefore surgery/procedure (172): Before going into surgery, always discuss your supplements. (705): If someone's going to do a brain cat scan on me tomorrow, I think they should know what I have ingested that morning. Type of office visit (418): I was going in for a physical and...I let him know I'm taking some Mass XXX. (455): If it's an establishment visit, you definitely want to let your doctor know everything you're taking.Supplements unrelated to purpose of visit (672): I really wasn't there to talk to him about supplements. (682): I went to see the doctor about something else. Competing demands during visit(151): I was more interested in addressing things that were probably way more important. (557): There are other things to discuss, and that doesn't really seem pertinent to any of the problems. Type of office visit (424): This was more kind of a follow up visit. There was no reason for it to come up. (363): [Because] it wasn't a general physical. Organizational and procedural factorsNot on list to discuss (329): [Supplement use] wasn't on my list of things to talk about. Provider already knows about supplement (565): [The doctor] already knows that I'm taking all the vitamins and everything because ... I usually tell these things to the nurse. (511): It's in my summary, and I do not think I need to talk about.ISSN: 2469-5793DOI: 10.23937/2469-5793/1510109 Guzman et al.

(867): I wanted to know if it was safe or not. Request advice from provider(329): To ask...whether or not a couple of these supplements I was taking them right. (857): It's important for me to talk to her about my supplement use because...I want her input. Circumstances of supplement useTaking unusual/multiple/mega-dose supplements (363): If I were to go on high potency regimen...then I think I should talk to the doctor.

Change in supplement use (591): I give her information every time I change my supplement list. (618): Every time I have a visit with a doctor, I talk about supplements. Or I talk about any additional supplements.Sporadic use (362) If you're very sporadic about taking supplements, it's probably not necessary to bother the doctor with that. (110): Light use...is why I didn't really bring it up - you know, a handful of Vitamin D, fish oils, Vitamin C, that kind of thing sporadically. Long duration of use(329): I...didn't bring it up because I've been taking them regularly for so long. Supplement considered safe(465): I don't see it as something that would harm me.

Medication relatedTaking prescription medication (329): If you're on a regular medication, you want to make sure your doctor knows that you're also on these other things. Prescribed new medication (110): I would have discussed it if I were being prescribed a new medicine. (158): What made me talk about it [was] ... I was kind of concerned about what she was giving me for my acid reflux...would it counteract the enzymes. Medical conditionHaving a medical condition (228): Anybody that has any health challenges should [disclose]. (820): I think with psychiatric conditions it is important.Good health/fitness (363): If my health is stable and good...I don't think it has to be brought up. (557): Because we're healthy.

(591): I want them all to know [what I'm taking] because they're very knowledgeable. Doctor receptiveness (122): It's a very open-door type of situation where I could call her and tell her ... I started taking something. (749): If my practitioner is open to that I would talk about it.Doctor lack of knowledge (455): I'm sure it wouldn't hurt [to disclose], but...I would doubt that she would know what they are. Doctor unreceptiveness/disinterest(157): I would never discuss it because they just don't want to hear about it. (151): I never would even think that a Western doctor would really be that interested. Prejudice against supplements (857) I'm probably not going to say I've tried to treat this with D-Mannose, or probiotics... because I just feel like there's...a bias against it. Patient convictionsImportant to disclose supplements (688): I think a doctor should know everything that you consume regularly. (705): I feel pretty strongly that she needs to have an up-to-date list of what I'm taking.Not worth mentioning (234): It's just something that I don't think is worth mentioning. Supplements are beneficial/commonplace(816): I didn't feel like I needed to bring them up because...vitamins and herbs are beneficial. (867): The Emergen-C, I think that's just a good drink... so I didn't think anything of it. Supplements are equivalent to food(648): Because I figured...everything we eat has vitamins in it anyway. (110): Because ... Vitamin C is in most fruit, if not all, I think. Vitamin D we get from the sun. Fish oils you get when you eat fish. Patient confidenceConfidence in own knowledge (820): I...am pretty savvy with what I ingest, so I didn't think [mentioning] it was worthwhile.

Five of the nine themes related to disclosure were sig-nificantly associated with reported disclosure (Table 4): Interaction during the visit (p < 0.001), discussion top - ic (p < 0.001), patient concerns about supplement (p < 0.01), medication related (p < 0.001), and provider char-acteristics (p < 0.001). Visit characteristics, circumstanc-es of supplement use, and medical conditions were not significantly related to reported disclosure. Six themes related to nondisclosure of supplement use were sig-nificantly associated with reported nondisclosure: in - teraction during the visit (p 0.01), visit characteristics nondisclosure to convictions about supplements: they aren't worth mentioning, are beneficial/commonplace, or are equivalent to food nutrition. One patient ex-plained, \"Usually I talk to him about everything. But just being a vitamin, I didn't feel it [was] necessary\" (156). Some interviewees expressed confidence in their own knowledge about supplements. Finally, some reported that supplements did not cross their mind during the of- fice visit (\"It's not a decision not to bring them up. It's more just not really thinking about it\" (560)). Statistical differences in disclosure and nondisclo - sure of supplements Statistical analyses revealed that interviewees re -ISSN: 2469-5793DOI: 10.23937/2469-5793/1510109 Guzman et al. J Fam Med Dis Prev 2019, 5:109 Page 8 of 11 mental versus discouraging/critical) is a moderating factor of disclosure. However, this study suggests that disclosure is often an impromptu decision driven by un - folding interactional opportunities. Nondisclosure may be the default practice for most patients, who typical - ly fail to think about their supplement use during visits and who disclose only when they have a specific con - cern or a certain threshold of relevance to the topic-at-hand is reached. Patients associate disclosure with out-of-the-ordinary circumstances, such as having con - cerns about a supplement they are taking or when me - ga-dosing. However, patients also associate disclosure with certain more routine topics of discussion, includ - ing talk about health problems the patient is treating with supplements and lab results they believe may be influenced by supplement use. Patients also view disclo - sure as warranted when a new medication is being pre-scribed. Some types of office visits are viewed as more appropriate occasions for disclosing dietary supplement use than others, specifically annual physicals and new patient appointments versus acute care and follow-up visits. Physician awareness of the circumstances patients associate with disclosure may enable them to better fos - ter disclosure and discussion of supplement use. If a pa-tient discloses use of a dietary supplement during a dis - cussion of laboratory results, for example, the physician may be able to use the opportunity as an interactional (p < 0.001), organizational and procedural factors (p < 0.001), circumstances of supplement use (p < 0.01), provider characteristics (p = 0.04), patient convictions (p 0.001), and did not cross mind (p 0.001). Medical condition and patient confidence were not significantly related to reported nondisclosure. There were no differences in the frequency with which patients of primary care and integrative/naturo-pathic providers mentioned themes promoting dietary supplement disclosure. However, primary care patients were more likely than integrative/naturopathic patients to raise several themes associated with nondisclosure of specific supplements (data not shown): circumstanc-es of supplement use (SE 1.36, p = 0.02), medical con - dition (SE 5.81, p = 0.03), patient convictions (SE 1.84, p 0.001), and patient confidence (SE 8.13, p = 0.03). There were no differences in how often patients raised themes about disclosure and nondisclosure based on supplement type. Discussion This study expands existing knowledge about pa- tients' motivations for disclosing dietary supplement use to primary care, integrative medicine, and naturopathic providers.

J Fam Med Dis Prev 2019, 5:109 Page 9 of 11 on patient recall. Study of office visit recordings and transcripts is warranted to identify patterns in actual disclosure and nondisclosure. In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest that promoting effective discussions about supplement use between patients and providers during office visits re - quires more than eliminating obstacles to disclosure and likely requires a proactive stance on the part of pro-viders to inquire about supplement use and to pursue discussions when patients raise the topic. Given the typ- icality of nondisclosure, asking direct questions about a patient's supplement use may be the most reliable way for providers to learn what a patient is taking. Posing questions in the contexts that patients associate with disclosure may help to maximize their effectiveness, and providers may need to address a range of patient convictions that militate against disclosure. Initiating discussion about supplement use may align with patient expectations about dietary supplement discussions [63], improve patient satisfaction [64, 65] and provid - er-patient relations [66], and set a positive precedent for disclosure in the future.

Statement of Authors' Contribution Drs. Guzm\u00e1n, Paterniti and Tarn designed the study and performed the qualitative analyses, Dr. Liu per- formed the statistical analyses, and all of the authors wedge to ask about other supplement use, producing a sort of domino effect for disclosure. To take advan-tage of factors that promote disclosure, provider educa-tion to increase inquiries about supplement use, which other studies have recommended [26,27, 29,33,34,38], could train doctors to target optimal occasions, as well as encouraging the sort of receptive communication style that facilitates patient trust and willingness to dis - close. Taking advantage of interactional opportunities to pursue non-judgmental supplement discussions may serve as a way for doctors to dispel patient perceptions that providers are not interested in talking about di - etary supplements [26, 27,29,38,41] and to convey why disclosure is vital for ensuring patient health by mitigat-ing potential adverse interactions and health outcomes, particularly in patients with pre-existing medical condi - tions [ 7,19]. Several factors associated with nondisclosure were more prevalent in primary care than integrative/natu- ropathic settings, suggesting that conventional primary care doctors face greater challenges to learning what supplements their patients are taking. These challenges include several patient convictions: that supplements are beneficial, commonplace, or equivalent to nutrition from food and that these characteristics make disclo - sure unnecessary. Other factors associated with nondis - closure that may disproportionately affect primary care practitioners include patients' confidence in their own good health and their knowledge about the supple - ments they are taking. Across practice types, patients do not appear to distinguish between products that may require consultation with a healthcare profession - al (e.g., herbal NVNM supplements, which may interact with prescription medications) and those that do not. Possible interventions to promote disclosure of dietary supplement use may include patient education about the risks of supplement-medication interactions and the importance of disclosing supplement use. Such in - terventions could be targeted to patients who take pre- scription medications or have chronic conditions that make supplement use particularly risky [7, 19,56-58]. Interventions targeted to providers could also empha-size the importance of inquiring about supplement use with these kinds of patients during chronic care visits and visits when changes are made to patient medica-tion regimens. The findings of this study are limited by the study population. The study sample was small and non-ran - dom, recruited exclusively in urban Southern California and overrepresented individuals with high educational achievement and non-Hispanic whites, who may not be representative of all dietary supplement users. Because use of dietary supplements varies across racial/ethnic groups, and disclosure rates for minorities are very low [4,32,34,42,59-62], further study of factors related to disclosure in these populations is warranted. Findings regarding disclosure are also limited because they rely ISSN: 2469-5793DOI: 10.23937/2469-5793/1510109 Guzman et al. J Fam Med Dis Prev 2019, 5:109 Page 10 of 11 - United States, 2013.
