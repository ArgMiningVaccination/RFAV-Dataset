He was 71. Anyone who knew Dan will miss his ready laugh, sharp wit and boundless energy. His ability to navigate the ebbs and flows of the news business \u2014 always keeping HealthDay'shigh journalistic standards firmly in sight \u2014 will be missed by all who worked with him. Dan's career first began as an analyst with the A.C. Nielsen Co. He later became senior vice president of sales at Lifetime Medical TV Network and also served in the same capacity at Physicians Online, an internet access portal for doctors. He also held a senior sales position at MedScape, a health and medical content company. Dan joined the news agency Reuters in 1998. While at Reuters, he headed the health division's sales team before being appointed division CEO just two years later. His long tenure as HealthDay's CEO began in 2003. HealthDay syndicates its news to hundreds of media outlets, hospitals, HMOs and government internet sites, health content distributors and major web portals. Dan joined HealthDay just as the internet and social media began to take off as a source for news. Adjusting to this historic shift, Dan spotted opportunities and industry trends while capitalizing on the reputation for quality content that the company had already amassed over the years. Dan's tenure saw the company through some heady times, but HealthDay flourished under his skilled direction. Retiring as CEO in 2018, he remained chairman of the board until early 2023. \"Dan's wit, wisdom and larger-than-life presence was an inspiration not only to me, but to everyone who shook hands with him, stranger or not,\" said HealthDay co-founder and Special Projects Editor George Giokas. \"He was an expert in his field who guided HealthDay to success through some rough waters, but more importantly a genuine friend who will be sorely missed.\" All of HealthDay's staff send out sincerest condolences to Dan's family \u2014 wife Deborah, sons Daniel, Ryan and Timothy (Aisling), grandson Ronan, and siblings Brian McKillen and Janice Ammann (Fred).
