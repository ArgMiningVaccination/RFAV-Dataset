My symptoms are getting worse... I am wondering if I can contact the doctor who prescribed the meds for you. [@sumitc2608](https://vestibular.org/participant/sumitc2608/) hi Sherry, no improvement so far and more symptoms surfacing...i have ear ringing, and ears inside very painful like pressure pressing, and eye floaters flying all over and blur vision on and off and light flashing at corner of left eye once only. I am just so tired of living .... Everyone - Are we dying or should we shout for help??? [@lmkk](https://vestibular.org/participant/lmkk/) you mentioned that you have had flare ups along the way but are getting better in general. How long do your flare ups usually last and how long between one flare up to the next? I'm 8 weeks out from 1st shot and 4 weeks out from 2nd. I was getting so much better, almost 90% gone I would say and then this past week it all came back (not worse then when it first started but i would very similar) . Very discouraged 10 days after my first shot I started feeling pressure and pain on my heart. Went to the doc, they ran tests that came back clean, Dr prescribed an allergy medicine and I was fine. This tingling and sharp pain pokes started a month after my shot. So it's been going on since September. The symptoms crept it slowly. I was feeling incredibly tingly, or felt random pains in my limbs, mostly thighs. It also makes my lips tingle randomly, which sometimes expands to my whole head. I started taking vitamin b complex, and it's helped tremendously,. Although with my current dose it wares off in about 6 hours, but then I just take more. But these sensations are only manageable because the vitamin b. I'm reluctant to make a dr appointment because I don't think they'd find anything, which probably sounds stupid. [@tinglyin2021](https://vestibular.org/participant/tinglyin2021/) I'd highly recommend making an appointment. I had to pressure my doctor for the echo because she insisted my symptoms were a product of anxiety. Turns out the heart problems are part of the pericarditis so I feel like everyone should get checked out. [@adenk]yes! My hands are always cold! And I wake up every morning with both my hands numbs, like they are asleep. This whole experience has been a nightmare. [@fdanielle](https://vestibular.org/participant/fdanielle/), did you find the cause of your symptoms? I've been waking up with both hands numb for the whole week. I'm scared to death [@lmkk]you mentioned that you have had flare ups along the way but are getting better in general. How long do your flare ups usually last and how long between one flare up to the next? I'm 8 weeks out from 1st shot and 4 weeks out from 2nd. I was getting so much better, almost 90% gone I would say and then this past week it all came back (not worse then when it first started but i would very similar) . Very discouraged Hi. Each flare up coincided with a cold. The first one was about 5 weeks after my vaccine. It lasted a week. Second flare up around 7.5 weeks after my first vaccine and lasted a fortnight but symptoms were more severe with this flare-up than initial symptoms that began straight after my first Pfizer vaccine. Third flare-up week 10 lasted a week. Fourth and current flare up started around week 12 and is still ongoing four weeks later. Pins and needles intensified but not nearly as bad as in the beginning of second bad flare-up. Have a constant low grade headache which is manageable without any pain relief, other symptoms are visual disturbances, dizziness, mild nausea, ear pressure/pain, facial nerve pain and twitching. All kicked off again when I got another head cold. I'm guessing it caused inflammation in my head and facial nerves. I'm feeling discouraged as well but as my head cold symptoms are still lightly lingering I guess that's why my symptoms are too. With each flare up they began a couple of days before my cold symptoms showed up and lingered a few days once the cold symptoms disappeared. Our bodies are working on overtime right now because of the vaccine induced inflammation so any further illness that we get really is putting us under extra strain. I have felt exhausted from this flare up. I checked several times but I'm coming back negative with covid tests even though my symptoms match mild covid. (Sore throat, mild temperature, headache, runny nose, sneezing, cold and shivery.) First time I've ever had a cold last a Month especially a mildish one so I know my body is under a lot of strain and struggling to fight the virus off. You may be having a flare-up because your body is trying hard to fight a cold infection off. Try to rest as much as you can. [@lmkk](https://vestibular.org/participant/lmkk/) thanks for that, helps to know that it did coincide with an illness and wasnt just random. I did have a bit of a cold around the time the flare up happened so I guess that's the trigger. I just really hope our bodies learn to get over this and it not going to be an ongoing thing for a long time. It's very unpleasant. I hope you start to feel better soon from this flare up! Abstract 10712: Mrna COVID Vaccines Dramatically Increase Endothelial Inflammatory Markers and ACS Risk as Measured by the PULS Cardiac Test: a WarningDoctors are not fully aware of our situation and how many we are.My first dose Pfizer was in August 30th. After symtoms including paraesthesias, itchiness, insomnia, arrythmias and tachycardia, I visited an allergiologist, a neurologist, asked consultation from an infectious disease expert. They all said I should proceed with 2nd dose.Only 2 days ago, I visited the vaccination center and the doctor there told me to see a neurologist again, and one specializing in COVID vaccines side effects (!) because new evidence has come up. She also told me that these side effects are almost certain coming back after dose 2, but I should be well hydrated and relaxed and they should go away.I am too scared to proceed with vaccination as I am now 32 weeks pregnant...Hope everything goes well for all of us! I held off getting my Pfizer vaccine until after I had my baby mid summer. Had Pfizer vaccine in August. So glad I waited. I haven't been back for my second jab due to ongoing side effects from the first. Obviously the decision is yours to Vax or not but think wisely before taking any action. Not long to go now you are 32 weeks! Congratulations on your pregnancy. Best of luck. - I'm so glad I found this forum. I got my second shot Sept 23rd - almost 8 weeks out now. I had no problems with the first shot. Within 6 days of the second, I had extreme weakness, fatigue, chest tightness, tingling and electric sensations that were shot through my chest and shoulders and down my arms and felt like I was burning inside across my chest and down my arms. Also, I had the electric feelings and burning in legs from the knees down to my feet, crazy heart palpitations, crazy high blood pressure (never any previous bp issues) and insomnia - cannot stay asleep. This initial attack to me to the ER, cardiologist visits and lots of blood work. the end result now is is my heart is fine, chest is clear. The intense burning and electric symptoms started improving about a week ago but I still feel the burning on the soles of my feet and palms of my hands. Instead of intense electric feelings, I feel like I have gloves on - up to my shoulders and also like I have socks on - up to my knees. I have mood swings and intense bouts of fatigue and weakness. I did yoga everyday before this and still don't have the energy to exercise at all. My provider ran additional blood tests and found everything to be normal except she found I have extremely high levels of the b vitamins. She tested B3, B6 and B-12. I stopped taking all supplements on Oct 18th. I did start improving about 2 weeks later. She told me vitamin B toxicity/overdose can be the cause of these symptoms. It all seems so coincidental and all doctors have told me it is not the vaccine but seemed awfully coincidental. An er doc had mentioned that I should check all the ingredients on the supplements that I take. Although I still have symptoms, I have had some relief from Vegas nerve exercises, qigong, tapping and CBD isolate to help me sleep. It can take up to 5 months to detox from vit. b although they are water soluble. I have looked at everything I take and the vitamin Bs are in many supplements including gummies and health promoting beverages. But this is weird cause the symptoms continue to be changing - as I now have pricking feelings on my face. The anxiety continues but at least is not as intense. Has the electric thing gone away? How are you feeling now? Please use the QUOTE option when you respond. I too almost have the same symptoms as you. Thank you very much for your comment! I have already decided to postpone 2nd dose, while diminishing any social contacts... But again I am concerned that 4-5 of members of this forum, including you, are postpartum/breastfeeding... Wish you all the best and relieved of these symptoms very soon!! [@hailey](https://vestibular.org/participant/hailey/) me! The pain intensity send random. It seems like I get the pricks from the neck down, but I think I mainly get them in my thighs. I still get tingling mainly in my lips, but it sometimes goes to my face and head. "}
