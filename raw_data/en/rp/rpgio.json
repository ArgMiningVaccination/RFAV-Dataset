Safety and security Crime Petty theft is common, particularly near tourist sites, on buses and in hotel rooms. Take particular care when walking around Kupandol, Sanepa and Thamel, popular tourist spots in Kathmandu, where pickpocketing is common. - Do not leave personal belongings unattended. Armed robberies, particularly of solo trekkers, occur occasionally - Exercise caution in and around Kathmandu and other cities - Do not travel after dark Festival season There is a significant increase in crime, including thefts, purse and bag snatchings, pickpocketing and break-ins, during the festival season, which extends from September to November. Maintain a high level of personal security awareness and ensure that your personal belongings and your passports are secure. Women's safety Women are vulnerable to harassment and verbal abuse. Dress conservatively, particularly in remote areas. Female tourists travelling alone are more at risk of violent attacks. Political tensions While Nepal continues its transition to a stable democracy, the political situation remains fragile and tensions can increase with little notice. Acts of violence Small-scale, politically-motivated attacks occasionally occur, especially in Kathmandu. Past attacks have led to injuries and sometimes caused deaths. Foreigners have not been targeted. Further attacks are likely. Demonstrations Political protests are common in Nepal and sometimes result in violence. Transport and public services may be disrupted at short notice. Politically motivated protests have been particularly volatile in Kathmandu as well as in Nepal's southern region bordering India, which has at times resulted in supply shortages and affected border crossings. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation. - Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place - Follow the instructions of local authorities - Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations [Mass gatherings (large-scale events)](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings) Strikes General strikes (locally referred to as bandhs) are a popular form of political expression and can occur on short notice throughout the country. Such strike action can affect access to services. While bandhs are usually peaceful, riots and violence are possible. During a bandh, businesses and roads may close and transportation services may be unavailable or severely disrupted. Avoid travelling on public transportation during or immediately preceding bandhs, as tourists have been injured. Transportation to and from airports throughout Nepal could be affected. Army and police checkpoints are frequent, especially at night. Follow the advice of local authorities and respect curfews and roadblocks. Trekking and mountain climbing Many popular trekking trails ascend higher than 5,500 metres. A number of hikers and guides have been stranded, injured or killed while trekking. You may experience acute mountain sickness at high altitudes and should be well informed on possible hazards in the high mountains. Drops in temperature and changes in weather conditions, including blizzards and avalanches can occur suddenly in mountainous regions at any time of year. If you intend to trek: - never do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company - buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation - ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity - ensure that you're properly equipped and well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard - inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back to camp - know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, which can be fatal - obtain detailed information on trekking routes or ski slopes before setting out and do not venture off marked trails or slopes Emergency services such as evacuations and rescues from remote areas are available but can be hindered by: - the lack of immediate payment to helicopter rescue services - a positive response from clients of their insurance companies - limited access to regular phone service in many trekking areas There have been helicopter rescue scams in the past. Ensure that you are dealing with reputable helicopter companies. Check with your trekking agency for updates on the security situation in the area. Trekkers' Information Management System All trekkers must purchase a trekkers' information management system (TIMS) card from one of the following entities: - the [Trekking Agencies' Association of Nepal](http://www.taan.org.np/) - the [Nepal Tourism Board](https://www.welcomenepal.com/) - an authorized trekking company National park permit You must obtain a national park entry permit before entering official trekking regions or routes such as those in the Annapurna, Everest and Langtang regions. Permits may be obtained from the national tourism board after arrival in Kathmandu or Pokhara. [More about trekking permits](http://www.taan.org.np/page/trekking-permit-fees) Rafting Organize white-water rafting excursions through reputable agencies only. Power cuts Due to an energy shortage, electric power cuts, termed \"load shedding,\" are a year-round occurrence. They occur frequently for short periods and without advance notice. Public transportation Most public buses are often poorly maintained and accidents involving buses, often causing injuries and fatalities, are common. Avoid travelling on overnight buses. Tourist buses are generally safe. Boat accidents are common due to the overloading and poor maintenance of vessels. Do not board vessels that appear overloaded or unfit, especially where there are strong currents. Road safety Exercise caution when travelling by road as road conditions and driving standards are poor and traffic laws are not enforced. Drivers often drive at excessive speed and often do not yield right-of-way to pedestrians. Many mountain and hill roads, which can be hazardous even in the best weather, are intermittently impassable during the monsoon season due to landslides. Traffic is congested in the Kathmandu Valley. Landmines Landmines and unexploded ordnance constitute a risk in parts of the country, including in some trekking areas. Follow the advice of local authorities, and only travel on well-used roads and paths. Air travel We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards. Entry and exit requirements Every country or territory decides who can enter or exit through its borders. The Government of Canada cannot intervene on your behalf if you do not meet your destination's entry or exit requirements. We have obtained the information on this page from the Nepalese authorities. It can, however, change at any time. Verify this information with the [Foreign Representatives in Canada](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?lang=eng). Passport Entry requirements vary depending on the type of passport you use for travel. Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements.

Follow this advice to lower your risk of becoming ill while travelling. Not all risks are listed below. Consult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic preferably 6 weeks before you travel to get personalized health advice and recommendations. Routine vaccines Be sure that your [routine vaccinations](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-3-vaccination-specific-populations.html), as per your [province or territory](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/provincial-territorial-immunization-information.html), are up-to-date before travelling, regardless of your destination. Some of these vaccinations include measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, varicella (chickenpox), influenza and others. Pre-travel vaccines and medications You may be at risk for preventable diseases while travelling in this destination. Talk to a travel health professional about which medications or vaccines may be right for you, based on your destination and itinerary. Yellow Fever - Country Entry Requirements [Yellow fever](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/yellow-fever.html) is a disease caused by a flavivirus from the bite of an infected mosquito. Travellers get vaccinated either because it is required to enter a country or because it is recommended for their protection. Risk - There is no risk of yellow fever in this country. Country Entry Requirement* - Proof of vaccination is required if you are coming from or have transited through an airport of a country [where yellow fever occurs.](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission-and-countries-requiring-yellow-fever-vaccination-(november-2022)) Recommendation - Vaccination is not recommended. - Discuss travel plans, activities, and destinations with a health care professional. - Contact a designated [Yellow Fever Vaccination Centre](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/travel-health/yellow-fever.html#select-centre%20)well in advance of your trip to arrange for vaccination. [Yellow Fever Vaccination Centres in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/travel-health/yellow-fever.html#select-centre%20) * It is important to note that [country entry requirements](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/vaccination-requirements-and-recommendations-for-international-travellers-and-malaria-situation-per-country-2022-edition) may not reflect your risk of yellow fever at your destination. It is recommended that you contact the nearest [diplomatic or consular office](http://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?view=d) of the destination(s) you will be visiting to verify any additional entry requirements. Hepatitis A [Hepatitis A](http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/hepatitis-a) is a disease of the liver spread through contaminated food and water or contact with an infected person. All those travelling to regions with a risk of hepatitis A infection should get vaccinated. Japanese encephalitis [Japanese encephalitis](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/japanese-encephalitis.html) is a viral infection that can cause swelling of the brain. It is spread to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. Risk is very low for most travellers. Travellers at relatively higher risk may want to consider vaccination for JE prior to travelling. Travellers are at higher risk if they will be: - travelling long term (e.g. more than 30 days) - making multiple trips to endemic areas - staying for extended periods in rural areas - visiting an area suffering a JE outbreak - engaging in activities involving high contact with mosquitos (e.g., entomologists) Hepatitis B [Hepatitis B](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/hepatitis-b.html) is a disease of the liver spread through blood or other bodily fluids. Travellers who may be exposed (e.g., through sexual contact, medical treatment, sharing needles, tattooing, acupuncture or occupational exposure) should get vaccinated. COVID-19 [Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) ](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html)is an infectious viral disease. It can spread from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air. It is recommended that all eligible travellers complete a COVID-19 vaccine series along with any additional recommended doses in Canada before travelling. Evidence shows that vaccines are very effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. While vaccination provides better protection against serious illness, you may still be at risk of infection from the virus that causes COVID-19. Anyone who has not completed a vaccine series is at increased risk of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and is at greater risk for severe disease when travelling internationally. Before travelling, verify your destination's COVID-19 vaccination entry/exit requirements. Regardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are adequately protected against COVID-19. Influenza Seasonal [influenza](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/flu-influenza.html) occurs worldwide. The flu season usually runs from November to April in the northern hemisphere, between April and October in the southern hemisphere and year round in the tropics. Influenza (flu) is caused by a virus spread from person to person when they cough or sneeze or by touching objects and surfaces that have been contaminated with the virus. Get the flu shot. Measles [Measles](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/measles.html) is a highly contagious viral disease. It can spread quickly from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air. Anyone who is not protected against measles is at risk of being infected with it when travelling internationally. Regardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are fully protected against measles. Typhoid [Typhoid](http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/typhoid) is a bacterial infection spread by contaminated food or water. Travellers going to countries in South Asia should speak to a health care professional about getting vaccinated. Malaria [Malaria](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/malaria.html) is a serious and sometimes fatal disease that is caused by parasites spread through the bites of mosquitoes. There is a risk of malaria in certain areas and/or during a certain time of year in this destination. [Antimalarial medication may be recommended](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/catmat/appendix-1-malaria-risk-recommended-chemoprophylaxis-geographic-area.html) depending on your itinerary and the time of year you are travelling. Consult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic before travelling to discuss your options. It is recommended to do this 6 weeks before travel, however, it is still a good idea any time before leaving. [Protect yourself from mosquito bites](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/insect-bite-prevention.html) at all times: Cover your skin and use an [approved](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/about-pesticides/insect-repellents.html) insect repellent on uncovered skin. Exclude mosquitoes from your living area with screening and/or closed, well-sealed doors and windows. Use insecticide-treated bed nets if mosquitoes cannot be excluded from your living area. Wear permethrin-treated clothing. If you develop [symptoms](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/malaria/symptoms-malaria.html) similar to malaria when you are travelling or up to a year after you return home, see a health care professional immediately.

While travelling, take [precautions](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/rabies/prevention.html), including keeping your distance from animals (including free-roaming dogs), and closely supervising children. If you are bitten or scratched by a dog or other animal while travelling, immediately wash the wound with soap and clean water and see a health care professional. In this destination, rabies treatment may be limited or may not be available, therefore you may need to return to Canada for treatment. Before travel, discuss rabies vaccination with a health care professional. It may be recommended for travellers who are at high risk of exposure (e.g., occupational risk such as veterinarians and wildlife workers, children, adventure travellers and spelunkers, and others in close contact with animals). Safe food and water precautions Many illnesses can be caused by eating food or drinking beverages contaminated by bacteria, parasites, toxins, or viruses, or by swimming or bathing in contaminated water. - Learn more about food and water precautions to take to avoid getting sick by visiting our [eat and drink safely abroad](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/food-water)page.

Reduce your risk of colds, the [flu](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/flu-influenza.html) and other illnesses by: - [washing your hands often](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/healthy-living/your-health/diseases/benefits-hand-washing.html) - avoiding or limiting the amount of time spent in closed spaces, crowded places, or at [large-scale events](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings?_ga=2.29124287.266168822.1670858124-1284851353.1649443099)(concerts, sporting events, rallies) - avoiding close physical contact with people who may be showing symptoms of illness [Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/sexually-transmitted-infections.html), [HIV](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/hiv-aids.html), and mpox are spread through blood and bodily fluids; use condoms, practise safe sex, and limit your number of sexual partners. Check with your [local public health authority](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/mpox/symptoms-management.html) pre-travel to determine your eligibility for mpox vaccine. Tuberculosis [Tuberculosis](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/tuberculosis.html) is an infection caused by bacteria and usually affects the lungs. For most travellers the risk of tuberculosis is low. Travellers who may be at high risk while travelling in regions with risk of tuberculosis should discuss pre- and post-travel options with a health care professional. High-risk travellers include those visiting or working in prisons, refugee camps, homeless shelters, or hospitals, or travellers visiting friends and relatives. Medical services and facilities Outside the Kathmandu Valley and Pokhara, medical services and facilities do not meet standards you might expect in Canada. Most hospitals require up-front payment or confirmation of insurance coverage prior to commencing treatment. Following an incident or accident, you should contact your travel insurance company without delay. Trekkers may experience frostbite and acute mountain sickness (AMS) at high altitudes. AMS can be deadly. Medical evacuation to Bangkok, Thailand, New Delhi, India, or Singapore is often necessary for serious conditions. Carry medical and first aid kits.
