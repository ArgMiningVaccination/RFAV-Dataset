NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT Pyramax 180 mg/60 mg Film -coated tablet 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION Each Pyramax tablet contains 180 mg Pyronaridine tetraphosphate and 60 mg Artesunate. Excipients with known effect: each tablet contains 0.11 yellow FCF (E110) and 0.58 mg Tartrazine (E102). For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Film -coated tablet Round, bi convex, orange coloured tablet 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Pyramax tablets are indicated in the treatment of acute, uncomplicated malaria infection caused by Plasmodium falciparum or by Plasmodium vivax in adults and children weighing 20 kg or more. Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antimalarial agents (see section 4.4) 4.2 Posology and method of administration Mode of administration The dose should be taken orally once a day for three days with or without food. Posology Dosage in adults and children Pyramax tablets should be taken orally as a single daily dose for three consecutive days. Body weight Number of tablet s Regimen 20 - < 24 kg 1 tablet Daily for 3 days 24 - <45 kg 2 tablets Daily for 3 days 45 - < 65 kg 3 tablets Daily for 3 days 65 kg 4 tablets Daily for 3 days A granule formulation is available for children weighing between 5 kg to under 20 kg. In the event of vomiting within 30 minutes of administration after the first dose, a repeat dose should be given. If the repeat dose is vomited, the patient should be given an alternative antimalarial drug. In the event of non-severe diarrhoea normal dosin g should be continued. If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as realised and then the recommended regimen continued until the full course of treatment has been completed. 3 Dosage in paediatrics population Pyramax is dosed according to body weight. The safety and efficacy of Pyramax tablets has not been established in children below 20 kg body weight. The clinical studies conducted in Plasmodium vivax malaria, included only 13 patients below 12 years old (see section 5.1.) Elderly Clinical studies included 54 patients over 65 years of age . No dosing adjustments are necessary based on present knowledge and the short 3-day course of treatment. However, considering the possibility of age-associated decrease in hepatic and renal function, caution should be exercised when administering the product to the elderly. Dosage in hepatic and renal impairment There is no information on dosing in patients with hepatic impairment . Due to its potential hepatotoxicity, Pyramax is contraindicated in patients with signs of hepatic impairment or known significant liver function test abnormalities. There is no information on dosing patients with severe renal impairment. Although excretion via faeces was the main route of elimination of pyronaridine -related material in a human mass balance study, significant urinary excretion was also observed. Pyramax is, therefore, contraindicated in the case of severe renal impairment and caution should be exercised when treating patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. 4.3 Contraindications - Known hypersensitivity to pyronaridine or artesunate or an y component of the formulation. - Patients with clinical signs or symptoms of hepatic injury (such as nausea and/or abdominal pain associated with jaundice) or known severe liver disease (i.e. decompensated cirrhosis, Child -Pugh stage B or C). - Severe renal impairment 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Pyramax tablets should not be used for malaria prophylaxis . Pyramax has been associated , in some patients, with transient increases in liver enzymes without clinical signs (see section 4.8). Pyramax is contra-indicated in the case of underlying hepatic injury , clinical signs or symptoms of hepatic injury or known severe liver disease (see section 4.3). Patients should be advised of the clinical signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity in order to monitor closely if such signs or symptoms occur, especially in the first two weeks after Pyramax intake. It is recommended that, in patients who exhibit symptoms of hepatotoxicity following treatment with Pyramax, the liver function tests be monitored , if possible, until normalisation. Insufficient data are available in patients with co -infections ( HAV, HBV, HCV, HIV) and those receiving co -administration of drugs known to be associated with mitochondrial toxicity (i.e. valproate ) or herbal medicines. No data are available in other hepatic underlying conditions (i.e. ethanol intoxication, hepatic steatosis). C aution is advised when treating these patients with Pyramax since the risk of liver toxicity with these risk factors, also including co -administration of drugs known to be hepatotoxic is not known and might produce a cumulative effect on the liver (see section 4.5 ). Enhanced surveillance is warranted in young children in case of malnutrition. 4 No specific QT/QTc study has been performed to specifically assess the cardiac safety of Pyramax . Based on the available comparative clinical studies, this risk does not appear to be higher with si ngle or repeat administration of Pyramax as compared to the other available antimalarial drugs used in these trials (artesunate + mefloquine, chloroquine, artemether -lumefantrine). However, patients with known history or evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular disorders (including arrhythmia, QTc interval 450 milliseconds) were excluded from these clinical studies. Therefore, caution should be exercised in at risk patients i.e. those: - with congenital prolongation of QTc interval, hypokalaemia, dehydration, cardiac arrhythmia, heart failure, etc. - treated concomitantly with other drugs that can block potassium channels, such as antiarrhythmics, neuroleptics, certain - recently treated with medicinal products with long elimination half -life and known to prolong the QTc interval that may still be circulating at the time Pyramax treatment course is commenced (see section 4.8. and 5.1.). A fall in haemoglobin may occur during treatment. There is very little information on the effect of this in patients with initial haemoglobin levels of less than 8 g/d l. Caution should be exercised in treating patients with a low haemoglobin. Pyramax should not be used for the treatment of severe malaria, cerebral malaria or other severe manifestations of complicated malaria, including hyperparasitaemia, pulmonary oedema, severe anaemi a, renal or hepatic failure. Patients with severe malaria are not candidates for oral therapy. In patients with acute malaria who present with severe diarrhoea and vomiting, alternative therapy should be considered. If Pyramax is used in these patients, the parasite load should be closely monitored. Pyramax is a blood schizonticide and for the treatment of P. vivax malaria, a radical cure (to destroy the parasite in the liver and thus prevent relapse) is required with a hypnozoitocidal drug such as primaquine. In the event of proven or suspected recurrent malaria infections within 28 days after treatment with Pyramax, patients should be treated with a different blood schizonticide. Artemisinin compounds should not be used for treatment of malaria in the first trimester of pregnancy if other suitable and effective antimalarials are available (See Section 4.6). There is no experience in the treatment of mixed P. vivax and P. falciparum infections. Limited data are available with Pyramax in the treatment of malaria due to Plasmodium malariae or Plasmodium ovale . The safety and effectiveness of Pyramax for the treatment of malaria in patients with HIV/AIDS has not been established as very few patients with known HIV have been treated. If Pyramax is used in these patients, the parasite load should be closely monitored. This medicine contains tartrazine (E102) and sunset yellow (E110) as colouring agents which may cause allergic reactions which may manifest as flushing, the appearance of wheals/urticarial, breathlessness, faintness and/or fall in blood pressure. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Particular caution is advised in case of co -administration of drugs known to be associated with mitochondrial toxicity (e.g., valproate, antiretroviral drugs), use of herbal medicines, and also co -5 administration of other drugs known to be hepatotoxic (e.g. rifampin, carbamazepine, isoniazid, paracetamol) (see section 4.4 4.8 ). Pyronaridine shows in vitro CYP2D6 inhibitory potential that is confirmed in vivo using metoprolol as CYP2D6 probe. The study shows an increase of metoprolol Cmax around 50% but the overall exposure increases to a lesser extent. Caution is therefore advised when co -administering Pyramax with metoprolol given in cardiac failure, notably during the titration phase , and a possible dose adjustment may be required. This also applies to flecainide and propafenone, two antiarrhythmics exclusively metabolised by vitro inhibitory substrates for P -gp such as digoxin and dabigatran may also require additional monitoring of blood levels and possible dose adjustment. The combination of Pyramax and primaquine has shown neither clinically relevant pharmacokinetic variations nor any impaired tolerance. If needed, the two antimalarial drugs may be co -administered. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) administration may result in a slight decrease in CYP1A2 activity. Caution is therefore, advised when Pyramax is administered concomitantly with medicinal products meta bolised by this enzyme that have a narrow therapeutic index, such as theophylline. Any effects are unlikely to persist beyond 24 hours after the last intake of DHA. Enzyme inducing medicinal products such as rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may lead to reduced DHA plasma concentrations. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy There are only limited data on the use of Pyramax in pregnancy. A component of Pyramax is artesunate, a recognized in vivo embryotoxic and teratogenic compound in animal models, including primate (see section 5.3). There is a limited amount of data from the use of artesunate during the first trimester of pregnancy. Pyronaridine did not show any teratogenic effects in animal studies. Artemisinin compounds cannot be recommended for treatment of malaria in the first trimester of pregnancy. However, they should not be withheld if treatment is considered lifesaving for the mother and other antimalarials are considered unsuitable. A rtemisinin compounds should only be used in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy when other treatments are considered unsuitable (see sections 4.4 and 5.3). Pregnancy registry A pregna ncy registry to monitor all pregnancies and their outcomes has been set up by the supplier . In the event that a patient is found to be pregnant whilst receiving Pyramax or becomes pregnant within two months of treatment this must be reported to the supplie r immediately. Lactation Studies in rats have shown that pyronaridine is excreted into breast milk. The benefits of breastfeeding to mother and infant should be weighed against potential risk from infant exposure to pyronaridine through breast milk. Fertility In animal studies, no effects on fertility and reproductive performance were observed. In these studies, the exposure to artesunate was below the human exposure; the maximum exposure to pyronaridine was 3 -fold higher than the proposed human expos ure. 6 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Dizziness, fatigue, asthenia and somnolence have been reported uncommonly or rarely following treatment with Pyramax. Patients should be warned not to drive or use machines if they feel tired or dizzy. 4.8 Undesirable effects The safety of pyronaridine tetraphosphate and artesunate for treatment of malaria has been evaluated in clinical trials of approximately 12,2 00 patients. Summary of the safety profile The most commonly reported ( >1/100 to <1/10) adverse event s were headache, eosinophilia, anaemia, increased platelet count, vomiting, abdominal pain, bradycardia, transaminase increases and hypoglycaemia. Tabulated list of adverse reactions The following table provides a summary of adverse reactions reported with Pyramax in clinical trial reports. Adverse reactions are ranked under headings of frequency using the MedDRA frequency convention: very <1/100); rare (<1/1000). System Organ Class Common Uncommon Rare Blood and lymphatic degree, sinus arrhythmia Ear and labyrinth disorders Vertigo Ear pain, hearing impaired, tinnitus Eye disorders Conjunctivitis Gastrointestinal disorders Abdominal pain, vomiting Constipation, , n ausea s tomatitis, s tomach discomfort, tongue ulceration General disorders and administration site conditions Asthenia, fatigue Chest pain, chills, hypothermia, pyrexia Hepatobiliary disorders Hepato megaly Hepatosplenomegaly, liver tenderness 7 System Organ Class Common Uncommon Rare Immune system disorders Hypersensitivity Infections and infestations Gastroenteritis, malaria, oral herpes, respiratory tract infection, tinea capitis respiratory section decreased, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, blood creatinine decreased, blood sodium increased, electrocardiogram abnormal, electrocardiogram QT prolonged (see section 4.4), liver function test abnormal Blood albumin increased, blood bilirubin decreased, blood bilirubin increased, blood creatinine increased, blood potassium decreased, haematocrit increased, red blood cell count increased, white blood cells u rine Metabolism and nutrition disorders Hypoglycaemia Anorexia, hyperkalaemia Decreased appetite, hyperglycaemia Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Myalgia Arthralgia, back pain system disorders Headache Dizziness, dysgeusia, paraesthesia Somnolence Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions Abortion complete Psychiatric disorders Insomnia Sleep talking Renal and urinary disorders Haematuria, proteinuria Ketonuria Reproductive system and breast disorders and mediastinal disorders Cough Asthma, epistaxis, haemoptysis, rhinorrhoea 8 System Organ Class Common Uncommon Rare Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Hyperhidrosis, pruritus, rash Blister, dermatitis, urticaria papular Vascular disorders Hypertension, hypotension * A rise in platelets generally from a low to normal level was commonly reported ( >1/100 to <1/10) Description of selected adverse reactions Changes in haematology parameters were generally of similar magnitude in all treatment groups and are expected consequences of malaria infection and treatment. Overall, white cell counts remained constant throughout treatment with falls in neutrophils and compensatory rises in lymphocytes and eosinophils. Treatment with Pyramax, in keeping with other antimalarials, has caused reductions in haemoglobin of up to 2 g/dL and sometimes more. These generally reached a nadir by Day 3 , recovering by Day 28. In Phase II/III clinical trials that evaluated one single 3 -days treatment course, Pyramax treatment was associated with mostly transient ALT elevations, with elevations of >3x upper limit of normal (ULN) and uncommonly, >10xULN , with early onset peaking between Day 3 and 7 and normalising by Day 28. In the Phase IIIb longitudinal study Pyramax was administered to patients experiencing single and repeated episodes of malaria and was shown to be similarly well tolerated on repeat administration as for first administration with repeat administration intervals as short as 28 days. The comparator arms of the study, artemether-lumefantrine or artesunate-amodiaquine, or a second study arm of DHA - piperaquine, also showed similar tolerability between initial and repeat administration. Where transient ALT elevations occurred, the adverse event profile was slightly higher with repeat administration for both adults and children. In Episode 1, the percentage of patients with ALT > 1.5xULN and 3xULN for the 4 Episode 2+, the percentage of patients with ALT >1.5xULN and 3xULN for the 4 treatment of syncope and isolated prolonged QTc were uncommonly reported in the available clinical trials for Pyramax . Mean decreases in heart rate were observed in all treatment groups and corresponded to reduction in the fever associated with the malaria infection (see section 4.4. and 5.1.). In the Phase IIIb longitudinal study, Pyramax compared favourably to the other treatment arms in terms of QTc (Bazett and Fridericia) both on initial or any repeat dose (measured centrally). In Episode 1, the percentage of patients with QTc (Bazett) >450 msec for QTc >480 msec. In Episode percentage of patients with QTc (Bazett) >450 msec >500 msec. Paediatric population The frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children over 20 kg in body weight are generally similar to adults. Repeat dosing did not demonstrate a significant increase in adverse events versus one -time treatment with Pyramax tablets including in liver function changes. Other specific populations Except for findings regarding significant transient transaminase rises in Caucasian healthy volunteers, which may be linked to differences of pharmacokinetics due to non -infected state of healthy volunteers rather than to the potential difference of metabolic pathways between ethnic origins , no unexpected or clinically significant differences were observed in the analysis of adverse events and laboratory values by intrinsic factors (age group, gender, race, weight), extrinsic factors (region, study drug dose) or disease severity factors (previous malaria episode, number of previous malaria episodes in the la st 12 months, baseline parasitaemia). In particular, patients with higher parasite loads (80.000/L) were not at greater risk of adverse events, laboratory changes or electrocardiogram and cardiac events than the main population as a whole. In the real -life Phase IIIb/IV study, 370 patients with malnutrition were enrolled. In these patients, there were no hepatotoxic events recorded and there was generally no difference in adverse events between those considered malnourished and those who were not. The safety of concomitant use of paracetamol has been explored in relation to hepatic transaminases in 3135 patients in the Phase II/III programme. Of 2453 (78.2%) who received paracetamol, there was no difference to changes in transaminases compared to patients who did not receive paracetamol. Additionally, paracetamol or paracetamol -containing products were administered concomitantly with Pyramax in 2128 episodes of treatment (24.9%) in the Phase IIIb/IV real -life study, including in patients with raised transaminases prior to dosing (27.2%) without any clinical evidence of hepatic impairment. A real -life Phase IIIb/IV study with the primary safety endpoint being the occurrence of clinical hepatotoxic events was conduct where 8560 episodes of malaria were treated with Pyramax, 158 episodes included patients who had an asymptomatic ALT and/or AST >2xULN. In these and any other patients, no clinically apparent hepatotoxic events occurred in the study and there was no evidence that asymptomatic raised transaminase levels at baseline were associated with clinical hepatoxicity on Pyramax treatment. 4.9 Overdose No case of overdosage with Pyramax has been reported. In cases of suspected overdosage symptomatic and supportive therapy should be given as appropriate, transaminases (AST and ALT) should be monitored. If there are significant rises then serial total and direct bilirubin values should also be obtained to determine whether there is any change in liver function. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: pyronaridine in artesunate, an art emisinin derivative, ATC Code: P01BF06 10 Mechanism of action Pyronaridine inhibits the formation of -haematin thus, preventing the malarial parasite from neutralizing haem, which is toxic to the parasite. Additionally, b y forming a drug- haematin complex pyronaridine inhibits glutathione -dependent degradation of haematin and enhances haematin-induced lysis of red blood cells. Both these actions lead to parasite death. Several mechanisms of action have been proposed to account for the activity of artemisinins; the generation of free radicals inside the parasite food vacuole and inhibition of the parasite's sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum calcium -ATP ase are widely accepted. Pharmacodynamic effects Whilst the outcome of in vitro studies using combinations of pyronaridine and artemisinin have reported mixed results, efficacy studies in rodent models of malaria using sensitive and resistant parasite st rains have shown enhanced therapeutic effects using a combination of both compounds in a 3:1 ratio respectively. Pyronaridine has potent in vitro activity against P. falciparum and P. vivax strains and clinical isolates including those resistant to other antimalarials. Against erythrocytic P. falciparum activity is greatest for the ring -form stage (ED 50; 8.3 nM), followed by high against chloroquine resistant strains. In vivo efficacy of pyronaridine has been reported in mouse and non-human primate models of malaria. Artesunate and its active principal metabolite dihydroartemisinin (DH A) show potent in vitro activity against multiple strains of P. falciparum and P. vivax , as well as against clinical isolates, including those resistant to other antimalarials. Reported IC 50s for inhibition of parasite multiplication are usually <19 nM. In vivo efficacy of artesunate has been reported in mouse, rat and non -human primate models of malaria. Cross resistance In vitro data from 181 clinical isolates showed that pyronaridine and artesunate were active against P. falciparum strains and isolates that were resistant to chloroquine, quinine, monodesethylamodiaquine, mefloquine or pyrimethamine and IC50 of both pyronaridine and artesunate were not affected by an increase in IC50 of chloroquine, monodesethylamodiaquine, mefloquine or pyrimethamine. I n another in vitro study conducted against 104 multidrug resistant P. falciparum isolates from Southern Papua, pyronaridine demonstrated potent activity against isolates resistant to chloroquine, amodiaquine (another quinoline -type Mannich base) and piperaquine. Cross resistance to other antimalarials cannot be ruled out. Resistance to artemisinin has been reported in clinical isolates in vitro and genetically stable resistance has been observed in animal models. R esistance has been reported as labile and difficult to induce experimentally in animals; however , those data cannot be extrapolated to humans in vivo . The threshold for resistance of P. falciparum to artesunate remains indeterminate however, prolonged parasite clearance times in patients with apparent artemisinin resistance have recently been described in Western Cambodia. Clinical efficacy Plasmodium falciparum malaria: Pyramax was demonstrated in Phase III clinical studies in both the Per Protocol (PP) and Intent to Treat (ITT) populations to be non-inferior to artemether-lumefantrine and mefloquine + artesunate in the treatment of acute uncomplicated P. falciparum in 2280 children and adults for the primary endpoint of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -adjusted adequate clinical and parasitological response 11 (ACPR) at 28 days. In addition, Pyramax was also found to be non -inferior to the comparator agents for the secondary endpoints of parasite PCR -adjusted ACPR at 42 days. Pyramax was rapidly effective, with more than 90% of subjects clearing parasites and fever within 48 hours. Parasite count (P. falciparum asexual forms) decreased rapidly (during the first 16 hours) in both the Pyramax and comparator groups. Time to parasite clearance was statistically significantly shorter in the Pyramax group compared with artemether -lumefantrine group based on the log-rank test. In the integrated analysis of all Phase III studies with P. falciparum , no clinically important differences in PCR - adjusted ACPR were observed by region, age, gender, race, weight, previous malaria episode, baseline parasitaemia, or formulation. Crude cure rate results were also similar. The median time to fever clearance was 15.5 hours. In all studies conducted in P. falciparum malaria, there was a marginal but consistently longer gametocytes clearance time in the Pyramax groups as compared to mefloquin e + artesunate or artemether-l umefantrine groups. Further trials are awaited to address the mosquito infectivity. In an analysis of a repeat -dose longitudinal study of 1342 patients treated with Pyramax tablets and granules for oral suspension, examining safety and efficacy of repeat dosing; of the 770 patients weighing 20 kg, 434 (56.4 %) received at least one further treatment and 31.6% had a second or more re-treatment. Reasons for non-inclusion into the study or non re -treatment were complicated malaria or hyperparasitaemia or significantly raised liver enzymes as well as comorbidities such as HIV, hepatitis, or severe malnutrition. Efficacy findings were similar to those in pivotal trials and were maintained with repeated treatment episodes. Patients previously excluded or poorly represented in the clinical studies were included in the Phase IIIb/IV study conducted in endemic areas. The PCR-adjusted ACPR at Day 28 for the initial malaria episode for all four treatment arms (all patients) were, respectively in ITT and PP population, 95.7% / was 96.3% / 99.9% for DHA -piperaquine . At Day 42, respectively . Subsequent episodes in the ITT/PP population are shown to demonstrate similar outcomes. For patients weighing 20 kg , in the ITT population, the PCR-adjusted ACPR at Day 28 for the four treatment arms were 97.1%, 9 3.7%, 95.2%, 97.3% respectively and respectively . Phase IIIb/IV real -life safety study: Patients previously excluded or poorly represented in the clinical studies were included in the Phase IIIb/IV real -life study conducted in endemic areas. The primary objective was to assess the safety of Pyramax in real -life in particular in subjects wit h transaminase abnormality without clinical signs. This large open -label non- randomised safety study included 7202 patients with 8609 episodes in total. The PCR -adjusted cure rate at Day 28 was in microbiological ITT (8480 malaria episodes). For patients receiving tablets i.e., >= 20 kg body weight, Day 28 PCR -adjusted cure rates were 99.4% (CI: 91.3, 92.7) in the mITT population. All subgroups by age, nutritional status and formulation produced broadly similar efficacy results. Overall, in this \"real -life\" safety study examining the effectiveness of Pyramax, the Day 28 cure rate was comparable to the parasitological cure rates reported in the previous Phase III studies performed in patients with uncomplicated malaria due to P. falciparum . 12 Plasmodium vivax malaria: In the studies in subjects with P. vivax malaria, non -inferiority of Pyramax compared with chloroquine was demonstrated with respect to the crude cure rate on Day 14 in the efficacy evaluable population (in children and adults), which was the primary end point in that study. Results were maintained in the intent-to -treat population. A high crude cure rate (95. 5%) was still observed at Day 42. Times to fever and parasite clearance were significantly shorter for Pyramax than chloroquine in this study. Only 13 patients less than 12 years old (no patient less than 7 years) were treated with Pyramax for P. vivax malaria . At the time the study was conducted, the areas where the studies were performed had low chloroquine resistance to P. vivax. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties There is no pharmacokinetic interaction between pyronaridine tetraphosphate and artesunate at the recommended dose. In clinical trials trough levels of pyronaridine and artesunate in children were generally withi n the range observed in adults. Absorption Following administration of Pyramax tablets to healthy volunteers and patients with malaria, peak plasma concentrations are generally reached between 0.5 and 1.0 hours post-dose for artesunate, between 1 and 2 hours post -dose for DHA and between 2 and 8 hours post -dose for pyronaridine. Exposure to artesunate and pyronaridine was increased by 34% and 20% respectively when Pyramax was administered with a high fat meal, however these effects were not judged clinically significant and patients can take Pyramax tablets without regard to meals (see section 4.2 ). Distribution Pyronaridine and its metabolites are extensively distributed into tissues, with highest concentrations achieved in the liver, spleen, adrenal gland, kidney and thyroid gland in the rat. The re is evidence that pyronaridine binds to melanin in the eye. In the dog, approximately 6% of a single dose of pyronaridine remained in the liver 24 months after administration. The potential extrapolation to human is not elucidated but the very slow elim ination of pyronaridine -related material from the body means that accumulation, with possible hepatotoxicity, cannot be ruled out if pyronaridine is readministered too early. Pyronaridine preferentially associates with blood cells, exhibiting a whole bloo d/plasma concentration ratio of approximately 1.5:1. Pyronaridine is highly bound to human serum proteins in vitro (92 to 95%). Pyronaridine displays two-compartment pharmacokinetic characteristics with a blood level profile that has a distinct distribution phase. Artesunate and its metabolites are primarily associated in the rat with tissues involved in absorption and excretion and high levels were also found in the spleen. Plasma protein binding of artesunate and DHA is moderate (62 to 93%) and albumin is the principal binding protein for DHA in human plasma. Biotransformation Pyronaridine appears to have a large number of potential metabolites, with no clear major metabolic route. Human in vivo metabolic profiling was conducted in blood, urine, and faecal samples from six healthy male volunteers in a microdose radioactivity mass balance study. Pyronaridine (unchanged) and a total of thirteen metabolites were identified in one or more sample Artesunate is rapidly metabolized by esterases to the active metabolite dihydroartemisinin (DHA). D HA is subsequently conjugated with glucuronic acid via UGT1A9 and UGT2B7. Elimination Pyronaridine is eliminated slowly from blood, with an elimination half -life in adults of between 14 and 18 days for parent compound, and a mean of 33.5 days for total drug -related material. Urinary excretion of unchanged pyronaridine is <2% in healthy human subjects. Data from the mass balance study with pyronaridine in healthy volunteers indicates that faecal excretion is the main route of elimination of drug-related material. In this study, pyronaridine -related material was excreted both via faeces (47.8%) and urine (23.7%) after oral dosing of pyronaridine to healthy human subjects. Elimination occurred very slowly, the mean recovery of 71.5% (range 60.3% -82.2%) was achieved by 86 days after dosing. In patients with uncomplicated malaria, artesunate and DHA are cleared from plasma with an elimination half -life of about 0.5 and 0.8 hours, respectively. No urinary excretion data are available for humans. Hepatic and Re nal Impairment Pyramax has not been studied for efficacy and safety in patients with severe hepatic and/or severe renal impairment (see section 4.2) . Elderly Patients No specific pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in patients older than 65 years of age. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Repeat -dose toxicity studies with pyronaridine tetraphosphate:artesunate (3:1) in rats and dogs produced similar effects to those seen with each component individually. The predominant feature in animals receiving repeated higher doses of pyronaridine tetraphosphate:artesunate (3:1) was related to the accumulation of pyronaridine. Microscopically, after repeated dosing, this was seen as a widespread accumulation of basop hilic material in many tissues and organs, sometimes present without associated inflammatory change (as for bone marrow and eye) but more often associated with dose -related inflammatory changes (as for liver, lung, spleen, gall bladder and kidney). It should be noted that, following a single 3-day cycle of treatment in dog, inflammatory changes were confined to liver and brain. These inflammatory changes are considered secondary to the body's attempt to clear the accumulated material, and an increase in wh ite blood cell count, predominantly in neutrophils and monocytes, is also considered a sequ ela of these changes. In more reactive tissues, notably rat liver, inflammatory and degenerate changes worsened over time in response to the prolonged presence of m aterial, and this was correlated with increasing transaminase levels. This increase in severity was not evident followin g a single cycle of treatment. Minimal to mild perivasculitis of the brain was noted in all repeat dose dog studies, including the single cycle study. This finding occurred with dose-related incidence, was not associated with relevant neurobehavioural changes and was not fully reversible. Thymus atrophy was observed after administration of pyronaridine and artesunate to rats and dogs. 14 HERG studies were performed with pyronaridine, artesunate and dihydroartemisinin ( DHA). Those studies showed that artesunate seldom had an effect on hERG tail current up to 300 M (115.3 g/mL) and that DHA and pyronaridine both inhibited hERG tail current with IC50s of 282.7 M and 0.65 M, respectively. Pyronaridine was clastogenic in in vitro chromosome aberration tests and mouse lymphoma assays. The positive findings in vitro with mammalian cells are consistent likely related to the potential of pyronaridine for topoisomerase II inhibition. Pyronaridine was negative in the in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus test and rat liver in vivo/in vitro Unscheduled DNA Synthesis assay. In the rat liver comet assay negative results were obtained at liver concentrations 45-fold higher than the estimated liver concentrations reached in humans. Overall, the genotoxic risk associated with the proposed treatment cycle using pyronaridine should be no greater than that associated with other current therapies. Artesunate was not genotoxic in a standard package of genotoxicity assays. Carcinogenicity studies were not conducted since the treatment is limited to 3 days. Neither pyronaridine tetraphosphate nor artesunate have effects on rat fertility. Artesunate is embryolethal at varying maternal dose levels and dosing regimens, depending on the nonclinical species. In fact, together other artemisinins severe anaemia. In cynomolgus monkeys, embryo lethality was observed in monkeys treated with artesunate for 30 days during the period of organogenesis, whereas no embryo lethality w as observed i n monkeys treated for a 3- or 7-day period during organogenesis, at comparable dose (which is 3 times the human dose based on mg/kg). In rats and rabbits, artesunate also caused embryolethality and foetotoxicity (decreased foetal body weight a nd increased skeletal and visceral variations). Pyronaridine was shown to cross the placenta in rats. At maternally toxic doses, it caused early resorptions and abortions in rabbits, and decreased foetal body weight in rats and rabbits. There was no evide nce of teratogenicity in both species. 6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT Pyramax 60 mg/20 mg Granules for oral suspension 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION Each sachet of Pyramax Granules for oral suspension contains 60 mg Pyronaridine tetraphosphate and 20 mg Artesunate. For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Pyramax granules for oral suspension Orange coloured granules 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Pyramax Granules for oral suspension are indicated in the treatment of acute, uncomplicated malaria infection caused by Plasmodium falciparum or by Plasmodium vivax in children and infants weighing 5 kg to under 20 kg. Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antimalarial agents (see section 4.4). 4.2 Posology and method of administration Mode of administration The dose should be taken orally once a day for three days with or without food. Posology Dosage for Granules for oral suspension in children and infants Pyramax Granules for oral suspension should be taken orally as a single daily dose for three consecutive days. Body weight Number of granules sachets Regimen 5 - < 8 kg 1 sachet Daily for 3 days 8 - < 15 kg 2 sachets Daily for 3 days 15 - < 20 kg 3 sachets Daily for 3 days A tablet formulation is available for children weighing 20 kg and over. Administration of Pyramax Granules for oral suspension: Add a small amount of water (approximately 10 ml i.e. 2 teaspoons) into a small cup. Put the contents of the required number of sachets (based on the weight of the child) into the cup and stir gently until the granules are suspended evenly. The granules will not dissolve. The patient should swallow the suspension immediately . Add a small amount of water ( approximately 10 ml i.e. 2 teaspoons) to the cup to mix any remaining granules and the suspension should then be immediately swallowed by the patient . It is recommended to repeat this step until the patient has swallowed all the granules and no granules remain in the cup. 17 Only drinking water should be used for preparation of the oral suspension. Administration with feeding tubes has not been studied. Caution should be exercised to avoid the risk of aspiration in very young children. In the event of vomiting within 30 minutes of administration after the first dose, a repeat dose should be given. If the repeat dose is vomited, the patient should be given an alternative antimalarial drug. In the event of non-severe diarrhoea normal dosing should be continued. If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible and then the recommended regimen continued until the full course of treatment has been completed. Dosage in paediatrics population Pyramax is dosed according to body weight. Safety and efficacy of Pyramax granules for oral suspension has been established in infants and children weighing 5 kg to below 20 kg, but not in children less than 5 kg. The clinical studies conducted in Plasmodium vivax malaria, included only 13 patients below 12 years old (see section 5.1.) Elderly Not applicable. Pyramax Granules for Oral Suspension are intended for children and infants weighing 5 kg to under 20 kg. Dosage in hepatic and renal impairment There is no information on dosing in patients with hepa tic impairment. Due to its potential hepatotoxicity, Pyramax is contraindicated in patients with signs of hepatic impairment or known significant liver function test abnormalities. There is no information on dosing patients with severe renal impairment. Although excretion via faeces was the main route of elimination of pyronaridine -related material in a human mass balance study, significant urinary excretion was also observed. Pyramax is, therefore, contraindicated in the case of severe renal impairment and caution should be exercised when treating patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. 4.3 Contraindications - Known hypersensitivity to pyronaridine or artesunate or any component of the formulation. - Patients with clinical signs or symptoms of hepatic injury (such as nausea and/or abdominal pain associated with jaundice) or known severe liver disease (i.e. decompensated cirrhosis, Child -Pugh stage B or C). - Severe renal impairment. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Pyramax shou ld not be used for malaria prophylaxis . Pyramax has been associated , in some patients, with transient increases in liver enzymes without clinical signs (see section 4.8). Data are very limited for infants weighing less than 5 kg (see section 5.1). Pyramax is contra -indicated in the case of underlying hepatic injury, clinical signs or symptoms of hepatic injury or known severe liver disease (see section 4.3). Patients or their parent/guardian should be advised of the clinical signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity in order to monitor closely if such signs or symptoms occur, especially in the first two weeks after Pyramax intake. It is recommended that, in patients who exhibit symptoms of 18 hepatotoxicity following treatment with Pyramax, the liver f unction tests be monitored if possible, until normalisation. Insufficient data are available in patients with co -infections ( HAV, HBV, HCV, HIV) and those receiving co -administration of drugs known to be associated with mitochondrial toxicity (i.e. valproate) or herbal medicines. No data are available in other hepatic underlying conditions (i.e. ethanol intoxication, hepatic steatosis). C aution is advised when treating these patients with Pyramax since the risk of liver toxicity with these risk factors, also including co -administration of drugs known to be hepatotoxic is not known and might produce a cumulative effect on the liver (see section 4.5) . Enhanced surveillance is warranted in young children in case of malnutrition. No specific QT/QTc study has been performed to specifically assess the cardiac safety of Pyramax. Based on the available comparative clinical studies, this risk does not appear to be higher with single or repeat administration of Pyramax as compared to the other available antimalarial drugs used in these trials (artesunate + mefloquine, chloroquine, artemether -lumefantrine). However, patients with known history or evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular disorders (including arrhythmia, QTc interval 450 milliseconds) were excluded from these clinical studies. Therefore, caution should be exercised in at risk patients i.e. those: - with congenital prolongation of QTc interval, hypokalaemia, dehydration, cardiac arrhythmia, heart failure, etc. - treated concomitantly with other drugs that can block potassium channels, such as antiarrhythmics, neuroleptics, certain - recently treated with medicinal products with long elimination half -life and known to prolong the QTc interval that may still be circulating at the time Pyramax treatment course is commenced (see section 4.8. and 5.1.). A fall in haemoglobin may occur during treatment. There is very little information on the clinical effect of this in patients with initial haemoglobin levels of less than 8 g/dl. Caution should be exercised in treating patients with a low haemoglobin. Pyramax should not be used for the treatment of severe malaria, cerebral malaria or other severe manifestations of complicated malaria, including hyperparasitaemia, pulmonary oedema, severe anaemia, renal or hepatic failure. Patients with severe malaria are not candidates for oral therapy. In patients with acute malaria who present with severe diarrhoea and vomiting, alternative therapy should be considered. If Pyramax is used in these patients, the parasite load should be closely monitored. Pyramax is a blood schizonticide and for the treatment of P. vivax malaria, a radical cure (to destroy the parasite in the liver and thus prevent relapse) is required with a hypnozoitocidal drug such as primaquine. In the event of proven or suspected recurrent malaria infections within 28 days after treatment with Pyramax, patients should be treated with a different blood schizonticide. Artemisinin compounds should not be used for treatment of malaria in the first trimester of pregnancy if other suitable and effective antimalarials are available (See Section 4.6). There is no experience in the treatment of mixed P. vivax and P. falciparum infections. Limited data are available with Pyramax in the treatment of malaria due to Plasmodium malariae or Plasmodium ovale . 19 The safety and effectiveness of Pyramax for the treatment of malaria in patients with HIV/AIDS has not been established as very few patients with known HIV have been treated. If Pyramax is used in these patients, the parasite load should be closely monitored. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Particular caution is advised in case of co -administration of drugs known to be associated with mitochondrial toxicity (e.g. valproate, antiretroviral drugs use of herbal medicines, and also co - administration of other drugs known to be hepatotoxic (e.g. rifampin, carbamazepine, isoniazid, paracetamol ) (see section ). Pyronaridine shows in vitro CYP2D6 inhibitory potential that was confirmed in vivo using metoprolol as CYP2D6 probe. The study showed an increase of metoprolol Cmax of around 50% but the overall exposure increased to a lesser extent. Caution is therefore advised when co -administering Pyramax with metoprolol given in cardiac failure, notably during the titration phase and a possible dose adjustment may be required. This applies to flecainide and propafenone as well, two antiarrhythmics exclusively metabolised by CYP2D6. As pyronaridine shows in vi tro P-gp inhibitory potential, substrates for P -gp such as digoxin and dabigatran may require additional monitoring of blood levels and possible dose adjustment as well. The combination of Pyramax and primaquine has shown neither clinically relevant pharmacokinetic variations nor any impaired tolerance. If needed, the two antimalarial drugs may be co -administered. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) administration may result in a slight decrease in CYP1A2 activity. Caution is therefore, advised when Pyramax is administered concomitantly with medicinal products metabolised by this enzyme that have a narrow therapeutic index, such as theophylline. Any effects are unlikely to persist beyond 24 hours after the last intake of DHA. Enzyme inducing medicinal products such as John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum) may lead to reduced DHA plasma concentrations. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy Not applicable. Pyramax Granules for Oral Suspension are i ntended for children and infants weighing 5 kg to under 20 kg. Pregnancy registry Not applicable. Pyramax Granules for Oral Suspension are intended for children and infants weighing 5 kg to under 20 kg. Lactation Not applicable. Pyramax Granules for Oral Suspension are intended for children and infants weighing 5 kg to under 20 kg. Fertility In animal studies, no effects on fertility and reproductive performance were observed. In these studies, the exposure to artesunate was below the human exposure; the maximum exposure to pyronaridine was 3 -fold higher than the proposed human exposure. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Not applicable. Pyramax Granules for Oral Suspension are intended for children and infants weighing 5 kg to under 20 kg. 20 4.8 Undesirable effects The safety of pyronaridine tetraphosphate and artesunate for treatment of malaria has been evaluated in clinical trials of approximately 12,200 patients. Summary of the safety profile The most commonly reported (1/100 to < 1/10) adverse event were headache, eosinophilia, neutropenia, anaemia, increased platelet vomiting, abdominal pain, bradycardia, transaminase increases and hypoglycaemia. Tabulated list of adverse reactions The following table provides a summary of adverse reactions reported with Pyramax for both tablets and granules in clinical trial reports. Adverse reactions are ranked under headings of frequency using the MedDRA frequency convention: very common (1/10); common (1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (1/1000 to <1/100); rare (<1/1000). System Organ Class Common Uncommon Rare Blood and lymphatic degree, sinus arrhythmia Ear and labyrinth disorders Vertigo Ear pain, hearing impaired, tinnitus Eye disorders Conjunctivitis Gastrointestinal disorders Abdominal pain, vomiting Constipation, , astritis, n ausea Abdominal tenderness, aphthous s tomatitis, stomach discomfort, tongue ulceration General disorders and administration site conditions Asthenia, fatigue Chest pain, chills, hypothermia, pyrexia Hepatobiliary disorders Hepatomegaly Hepatosplenomegaly, liver tenderness Immune Hypersensitivity Infections and infestations Gastroenteritis, malaria, oral herpes, respiratory tract infection, tinea capitis, upper respiratory tract subcutaneous abscess, tracheobronchitis 21 System Organ Class Common Uncommon Rare Investigations Transaminases increased (See section 4.4) Blood albumin decreased, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, blood creatinine decreased, blood sodium increased, electrocardiogram abnormal, electrocardiogram QT prolonged (see section 4.4), liver function test abnormal Blood albumin increased, blood bilirubin decreased, blood bilirubin increased, blood creatinine increased, blood potassium decreased, haematocrit increased, red blood cell count increased, white blood cells urine Metabolism and nutrition disorders Hypoglycaemia Anorexia, hyperkalaemia Decreased appetite, hyperglycaemia Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Myalgia Arthralgia, back pain system disorders Headache Dizziness, dysgeusia, paraesthesia Somnolence Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions Abortion complete Psychiatric disorders Insomnia Sleep talking Renal and urinary disorders Haematuria, proteinuria Ketonuria Reproductive system and breast disorders and mediastinal disorders Cough urticaria papular Vascular disorders Hypertension, hypotension * A rise in platelets generally from a low to normal level was commonly reported ( 1/100 to < 1/10) Description of selected adverse reactions Changes in haematology parameters were generally of similar magnitude in all treatment groups and are expected consequences of malaria infection and treatment. Overall, white cell counts remained constant throughout treatment with falls in neutrophils and compens atory rises in lymphocytes and eosinophils. 22 Treatment with Pyramax, in keeping with other antimalarials, has caused reductions in haemoglobin of up to 2 g/dL and sometimes more. These generally reached a nadir by Day 3 recovering by Day 28. In Phase II/I II clinical trials evaluating one single 3-day treatment course, Pyramax treatment was associated with mostly transient ALT elevations, with elevations of > 3x upper limit of normal (ULN) and uncommonly, > 10xULN with early onset peaking between Day 3 and 7 and normalising by Day 28. In the Phase IIIb longitudinal study Pyramax was administered to patients experiencing single and repeated episodes of malaria and was shown to be similarly well tolerated on repeat administration , as for first administration with repeat administration intervals as short as 28 days. The comparator arms of the study, artemether-lumefantrine or artesunate-amodiaquine, or a second study arm of DHA - piperaquine, also showed similar tolerability between initial and repeat administrat ion. Where transient ALT elevations occurred, the adverse event profile was similar with repeat administration for both adults and children based on data associated with the treatment of Episode 1 and any repeat treatment (Episodes 2+) for all treatment arms in terms of liver enzyme classifications for the highest post Day 0 values . A sub analysis of liver function t ests in the granules population of the longitudinal study was performed and the i ncidence of ALT values relative to the normal range, by body weight <10 kg or 10 kg for the three treatment arms using the highest post -Day 0 value were similar across the treatment groups and weight categories. One p otential Hy's law case on Pyramax were seen in the <10 kg body weight group occurring in Episode 3. There was o ne case of potential Hy's law case on Pyramax were seen in the 10 kg body weight group occurring in Episode 1 and, in this case , the patient was subsequently retreated with no recurrence of the hepatotoxicity. There were two Hy's law cases reported in the artemether- lumefantrine group in the 10 kg body weight group; one case occurring in Episode 1 and the other on re -treatment . Cases of syncope and isolated prolonged QTc were uncommonly reported in the available clinical trials. Mean decreases in heart rate were observed in all treatment groups and corresponded to reduction in the fever associated with the malaria infection (see section 4.4. and 5.1.). In the Phase IIIb longitudinal study, Pyramax compared favourably to the other treatment arms in terms of QTc (Bazett and Fridericia) both on initial or any repeat dose (measured centrally). In Episode 1, the percentage of patients with QTc (Bazett) >450 msec for QTc >480 msec. In Episode percentage of patients with QTc (Bazett) >450 msec >500 msec. were no post dose QTc and no post dose >450 msec nor any increases of >60 msec from baseline in th e granules population including patients less than 10 kg. Paediatric population The frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children 5 kg and over in body weight are generally similar to adults, however, to date, very few patients weighing less than 8 kg have been treated with Pyramax . Repeat dosing in the 128 children re -dosed at least once with Pyramax granules 23 did not demonstrate a significant increase in adverse events versus one-time treatment with Pyramax including in liver function changes. Other specific populations Except for findings regarding significant transient transaminase rises in Caucasian healthy volunte ers - which may be linked to differences of pharmacokinetics due to non -infected state of healthy volunteers rather than to the potential difference of metabolic pathways between ethnic origins - no unexpected or clinically significant differences were observed in the analysis of adverse events and laboratory values by intrinsic factors (age group, gender, weight), extrinsic factors (region, study drug dose) or disease severity factors (previous malaria episode, number of previous malaria episodes in the last 12 months, baseline parasitaemia) and in particular, patients with higher parasite loads (80.000/L) were not at greater risk of adverse events, laboratory changes or electrocardiogram and cardiac events than the main population as a whole. In the real -life Phase IIIb/IV study, 370 patients with malnutrition were enrolled. In these patients, there were no hepatotoxic events recorded and there was generally no difference in adverse events between those considered malnourished and those who were not. The safety of concomitant use of paracetamol has been explored in relation to hepatic transaminases in 3135 patients in the Phase II/III programme. Of 2453 (78.2%) who received paracetamol, there was no difference to changes in transaminases compared to patients who did not receive paracetamol. Additionally, paracetamol or paracetamol -containing products were administered concomitantly with Pyramax in 2128 episodes of treatment (24.9%) in the Phase IIIb/IV real -life study, including in patients with raised transaminases prior to dosing (27.2%) without any clinical evidence of hepatic impairment. A real -life Phase IIIb/IV study with the primary safety endpoint being the occurrence of clinical hepatotoxic events was conduct where 8560 episodes of malaria were treated with Pyramax, 158 episodes included patients who had an asymptomatic ALT and/or AST >2xULN. In these and any other patients, no clinically apparent hepatotoxic events occurred in the study and there was no evidence that asymptomatic raised transaminase levels at baseline were associated with clinical hepa totoxicity on Pyramax treatment. 4.9 Overdose No case of overdosage with Pyramax has been reported. In cases of suspected overdosage symptomatic and supportive therapy should be given as appropr iate, transaminases (AST and ALT) should be monitored. If there are significant rises then serial total and direct bilirubin values should also be obtained to determine whether there is any change in liver function. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: pyronaridine artesunate, derivative, ATC Code: P01BF06 Mechanism of action Pyronaridine inhibits the formation of -haematin thus, preventing the malarial parasite from neutralizing haem, which is toxic to the parasite. Additionally, b y forming a drug- haematin complex pyronaridine inhibits glutathione -dependent degradation of haematin and enhances haematin-induced lysis of red blood cells. Both these actions lead to parasite death. 24 Several mechanisms of action have been proposed to account for the activity of artemisinins; the generation of free radicals inside the parasite food vacuole and inhibition of the parasite's sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum calcium -ATP ase are widely accepted. Pharmacodynamic effects Whilst the outcome of in vitro studies using combinations of pyronaridine and artemisinin have reported mixed results, efficacy studies in rodent models of malaria using sensitive and resistant parasite st rains have shown enhanced therapeutic effects using a combination of both compounds in a 3:1 ratio respectively. Pyronaridine has potent in vitro activity against P. falciparum and P. vivax strains and clinical isolates including those resistant to other antimalarials. Against erythrocytic P. falciparum activity is greatest for the ring -form stage (ED 50; 8.3 nM), followed by chloroquine resistant strains. In vivo efficacy of pyronaridine has been reported in mouse and non-human primate models of malaria. Artesunate and its active principal metabolite dihydroartemisinin (DHA) show potent in vitro activity against multiple strains of P. falciparum and P. vivax , as well as against clinical isolates, including those resistant to other antimalarials. Reported IC 50s for inhibition of parasite multiplication are usually <19 nM. In vivo efficacy of artesunate has been reported in mouse, rat and non -human primate models of malaria. Cross resistance In vitro data from 181 clinical isolates showed that pyronaridine and artesunate were active against P. falciparum strains and isolates that were resistant to chloroquine, quinine, monodesethylamodiaquine, mefloquine or pyrimethamine and IC50 of both pyronaridine and artesunate were not affected by an increase in IC50 of chloroquine, monodesethylamodiaquine, mefloquine or pyrimethamine. In another in vitro study conducted against 104 multidrug resistant P. falciparum isolates from Southern Papua, pyronaridine demonstrated potent activity against isolates resistant to chloroquine, amodiaquine (another quinoline -type Mannich base) and piperaquine. Cross resistance to other antimalarials cannot be ruled out. Resistance to artemisinin has been reported in clinical isolates in vitro and genetically stable resistance has been observed in animal models. Resistance has been reported as labile and difficult to induce experimentally in animals; h owever those data cannot be extrapolated to humans in vivo . The threshold for resistance of P. falciparum to artesunate remains indeterminate however, prolonged parasite clearance times in patients with apparent artemisinin resistance have recently been described in Western Cambodia. Clinical efficacy Plasmodium falciparum malaria: Pyramax was demonstrated in Phase III clinical studies in both the Per Protocol (PP) and Intent to Treat (ITT) populations to be non-inferio r to artemether-lumefantrine and mefloquine + artesunate in the treatment of acute uncomplicated P. falciparum in 2280 children and adults for the primary endpoint of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -adjusted adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) at 28 days. In addition, Pyramax was also found to be non -inferior to the comparator agents for the secondary endpoints of parasite PCR -adjusted ACPR at 42 days. Pyramax was rapidly effective, with more than 90% of subjects clearing parasites and fev er within 48 hours. Parasite count (P. falciparum asexual forms) decreased rapidly (during the first 16 hours) in both the Pyramax and comparator groups. Time to parasite clearance was statistically significantly shorter in the Pyramax group compared wit h artemether -lumefantrine group based on the log-rank test. In the integrated analysis of all Phase III studies with P. falciparum , no clinically important differences in PCR - adjusted ACPR were observed by region, age, gender, race, weight, previous malaria episode, baseline 25 parasitaemia, or formulation. Crude cure rate results were also similar. The median time to fever clearance was 15.5 hours. In all studies conducted in P. falciparum malaria, there was a marginal but consistently longer gametocytes clearance time in the Pyramax groups as compared to mefloquine + artesunate or artemether-lumefantrine groups. Further trials are awaited to address the mosquito infectivity. In an analysis of a longitudinal study of 1342 patients treated with Pyramax tablets and granules for oral suspension, examining safety and efficacy of repeat dosing; 572 patients were between 5 and under 20 kg. Three hundred and ninety -three (393) patients received treatment with Pyramax for more than one malaria episode (68.7%) a nd 277 (48.4%) were treated for 3 or more malaria episodes. To date 43 patients under 10 kg received Pyramax granules for oral suspension in the longitudinal study . Reasons for non-inclusion into the study or non re -treatment were complicated malaria or hyperparasitaemia or significantly raised liver enzymes as well as comorbidities such as HIV, hepatitis, or severe malnutrition. Efficacy findings were similar to those in pivotal trials and were maintained with repeated treatment episodes. Patients previous ly excluded or poorly represented in the clinical studies were included in Phase IIIb /V study conducted in endemic areas. For patients weighing < 20 kg the PCR-adjusted ACPR in the I TT p opulation at Day 28 for the four treatment 89.4% respectively. Phase IIIb/IV real -life safety study: Patients previously excluded or poorly represented in the clinical studies were included in the Phase IIIb/IV real -life study conducted in endemic areas. The primary objective was to assess the safety of Pyramax in real -life in particular in subjects with transaminase abnormality without clinical signs. This la rge open -label non- randomised safety study included 7202 patients with 8609 episodes in total. The PCR -adjusted cure rate at Day 28 was 98.6% (CI: 91.5) in microbiological ITT (8480 malaria episodes). All subgroups by age, nutritional status and formulation produced broadly similar efficacy results. Overall, in this \"real -life safety study examining the effectiveness of Pyramax, the Day 28 cure rate was comparable to the parasitological cure rates reported in the previous Phase III studies performed in patients with uncomplicated malaria due to P. falciparum. Plasmodium vivax malaria: In the studies in subjects with P. vivax malaria, non -inferiority of Pyramax compared with chloro quine was demonstrated with respect to the crude cure rate on Day 14 in the efficacy evaluable population (in children and adults), which was the primary end point in that study. Results were maintained in the intent-to -treat population. A high crude cur e rate (95.5%) was still observed at Day 42. Times to fever and parasite clearance were significantly shorter for Pyramax than chloroquine in this study. Only 13 patients less than 12 years old (no patient less than 7 years) were treated with Pyramax for P vivax malaria. At the time the study was conducted, the areas where the studies were performed had low chloroquine resistance to P vivax. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Information on the pharmacokinetic of pyronaridine tetraphosphate and artesunate is mainly derived from the use of the tablet formulation. There is no pharmacokinetic interaction between pyronaridine tetraphosphate and artesunate at the recommended dose. 26 In clinical trials trough levels of pyronaridine and artesunate in children were g enerally within the range observed in adults. Pyramax produces a uniform exposure across the weight ranges for the proposed labelled dosing of granules with no increased exposure seen in the younger patient range. Absorption Following administration of P yramax tablets to healthy volunteers and patients with malaria, peak plasma concentrations are generally reached between 0.5 and 1.0 hours post-dose for artesunate, between 1 and 2 hours post -dose for DHA and between 2 and 8 hours post -dose for pyronaridine. Exposure to artesunate and pyronaridine was increased by 34% and 20% respectively when Pyramax was administered with a high fat meal, however these effects were not judged clinically significant and patients can take Pyramax tablets without regard to meals (see section 4.2 ). Distribution Pyronaridine and its metabolites are extensively distributed into tissues, with highest concentrations achieved in the liver, spleen, adrenal gland, kidney and thyroid gland in the rat. There is evidence that pyronarid ine binds to melanin in the eye. In the dog, approximately 6% of a single dose of pyronaridine remained in the liver 24 months after administration. The potential extrapolation to human is not elucidated but the very slow elimination of pyronaridine -relat ed material from the body means that accumulation, with possible hepatotoxicity, cannot be ruled out if pyronaridine is readministered too early. Pyronaridine preferentially associates with blood cells, exhibiting a whole blood/plasma concentration ratio of approximately 1.5:1. Pyronaridine is highly bound to human serum proteins in vitro (92 to 95%). Pyronaridine displays two-compartment pharmacokinetic characteristics with a blood level profile that has a distinct distribution phase . Artesunate and its metabolites are primarily associated in the rat with tissues involved in absorption and excretion and high levels were also found in the spleen. Plasma protein binding of artesunate and DHA is moderate (62 to 93%) and albumin is the principal binding protein for DHA in human plasma. Biotransformation Pyronaridine appears to have a large number of potential metabolites, with no clear major metabolic route. Human in vivo metabolic profiling was conducted in blood, urine, and faecal samples from six healthy male volunteers in a microdose radioactivity mass balance study. Pyronaridine (unchanged) and a total of thirteen metabolites were identified in one or more sample experiments indicate that CYP1A2, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 could be involved in the metabolism of pyro naridine. In vitro, pyronaridine inhibits the activity of CYP2D6 at therapeutic plasma concentrations. Artesunate is very rapidly metabolised by esterases to the active metabolite dihydroartemisinin (DHA). DHA is subsequently conjugated with glucuronic acid via UGT1A9 and UGT2B7. Elimination Pyronaridine is eliminated slowly from blood, with an elimination half -life in adults of between 14 and 18 days for parent compound, and a mean of 33.5 days for total drug-related material. The mean elimination half -life for paediatric malaria patients is 12.3 days. Urinary excretion of unchanged pyronaridine is <2% in healthy human subjects. Data from the mass balance study with pyronaridine 27 in healthy volunteers indicates that faecal excretion is the main route of e limination of drug -related material. In this study, pyronaridine -related material was excreted both via faeces (47.8%) and urine (23.7%) after oral dosing of pyronaridine to healthy human subjects. Elimination occurred very slowly, the mean recovery of 71 .5% (range 60.3% -82.2%) was achieved by 86 days after dosing. In patients with uncomplicated malaria, artesunate and DHA are cleared from plasma with an elimination half -life of about 0.5 and 0.8 hours, respectively. No urinary excretion data are availab le for humans. Hepatic and Renal Impairment Pyramax has not been studied for efficacy and safety in patients with severe hepatic and/or severe renal impairment (see section 4.2) . Elderly Patients Pyramax granules are intended for patients weighing less than 20 kg only. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Repeat-dose toxicity studies with pyronaridine tetraphosphate:artesunate (3:1) in rats and dogs produced similar effects to those seen with each component individually. The predominant feature in animals receiving repeated higher doses of pyronaridine tetraphosphate:artesunate (3:1) was related to the accumulation of pyronaridine. Microscopically, after repeated dosing, this was seen as a widespread accumulation of basophilic material in many tissues and organs, sometimes present without associated inflammatory change (as for bone marrow and eye) but more often associated with dose -related inflammatory changes (as for liver, lung, spleen, gall bladder and kidney). It should be noted that, following a singl e 3-day cycle of treatment in dog, inflammatory changes were confined to liver and brain. These inflammatory changes are considered secondary to the body's attempt to clear the accumulated material, and an increase in white blood cell count, predominantly in neutrophils and monocytes, is also considered a sequela of these changes. In more reactive tissues, notably rat liver, inflammatory and degenerate changes worsened over time in response to the prolonged presence of material, and this was correlated with increasing transaminase levels. This increase in severity was not evident following a single cycle of treatment. Minimal to mild perivasculitis of the brain was noted in all repeat dose dog studies, including the single cycle study. This finding occurred with dose -related incidence, was not associated with relevant neurobehavioural changes and was not fully reversible. Thymus atrophy was observed after administration of pyronaridine and artesunate to rats and dogs. HERG studies were performed with pyronaridine, artesunate and dihydroartemisinin (DHA). Those studies showed that artesunate seldom had an effect on hERG tail current up to 300 M (115.3 g/mL) and that DHA and pyronaridine both inhibited hERG tail current with IC50s of 282.7 M and 0.65 M, respectively. Pyronaridine was clastogenic in in vitro chromosome aberration tests and mouse lymphoma assays. The positive findings in vitro with mammalian cells are consistent likely related to the potential of pyronaridine for topoisomerase II inhibition. Pyronaridine was negative in the in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus test and rat liver in vivo/in vitro Unscheduled DNA Synthesis assay. In the rat liver comet assay negative results were obtained at liver concentrations 45-fold higher than the estimated liver concentrations reached in humans. Overall, the genotoxic risk associated with the proposed treatment cycle using pyronaridine should be no greater than that associated with other 28 current therapies. Artesunate was not genotoxic in a standard package of genotoxicity assays. Carcinogenicity studies were not conducted since the treatment is limited to 3 days. Neither pyronaridine tetraphosphate nor artesunate have effects on rat fertility. Artesunate is embryolethal at varying maternal dose lev els and dosing regimens, depending on the nonclinical species. In fact, other anaemia. In cynomolgus monkeys, embryo lethality was observed in monkeys treated with artesunate for 30 days during the period of organogenesis, whereas no embryo lethality was observed in monkeys treated for a 3- or 7-day period during organogenesis, at comparable dose (which is 3 times the human dose based on mg/kg). In rats and rabbits, artesunate also caused embryolethality and foetotoxicity (decreased foetal body weight and increased skeletal and visceral variations). Pyronaridine was shown to cross the placenta in rats. At maternally toxic doses, it caused early resorptions and abortions in rabbits, and decreased foetal body weight in rats and rabbits. There was no evidence of teratogenicity in both species. 6.
