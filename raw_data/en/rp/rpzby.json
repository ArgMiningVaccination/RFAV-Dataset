The committee is composed of AAEP member volunteers from both small and large private practices as well as academia and industry. Membersinclude both general practitioners and specialists. The 2021 program includes invited papers for the \"In-depth \"and \"How-to \"sessions as well as sessions comprised of papers that independent authors submitted for consideration. Topic choices for the invited \"In-depth \"and \"How-to \"sessions are based on member feedback from AAEP CE Needs Analysis surveys. Topic session leaders are selected by the Program Chair, and then these session leaders invite a slate of speakers to prepare the papers that become an \"In-depth \"overview or a series of related \"How-to \"talks. Although invited, these papers undergo a rigorous peer review process by the SREC. Papers submitted by independent authors are each assigned 3 reviewers from the SREC. The reviewers do not know the names of the authors. Content is scored using the criteria of Study Design, Study Quality, Innovation and Impact, Practicality, and Manuscript Quality. This year 85 papers were submit-ted for the 50 available slots on the program. Non-scienti c sessions addressing business, ethical, and industry concerns are also planned as the sci- entic program materializes. Speakers who are invited to participate in these sessions prepare papers that are also reviewed by members of the SREC for inclusion in the Proceedings. The peer review process for the AAEP Proceedings is rigorous. It requires an enormous effort by over 50 members of the SREC to create the best possible program for the AAEP membership. Many volun- teer hours were spent putting together the 2021 program, so please thank them for all their hard workcreating this program for you. ii 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSFrom Your President Dear AAEP Members & Guests: Welcome to Nashville, The Music City, for the 67thAnnual AAEP Convention and Trade Show. It is with great pleasure that I greet all of you to the return of our live con- vention. Although, there will be things that we have taken away from last year 's virtual convention, there' s no replacement for seeing all of you in person and getting to catch up on all the challenges of the last 2 years. Dr. Emma Read, AAEP 's president elect and program chair for this year 's convention, has worked diligently to put together an outstanding program. Her program will be lled with a wide array of interesting and timely topics. Educational Programs Committee chair Dr. Charlie Scoggin and Vice Chair, Dr. Erin Contino have man- aged a large group of your colleagues to provide for the selection and review of papers presented in this program.I want to give a personal thanks to all the member volunteers that have contributed to this process. It is not an easy task. This year 's meeting will once again feature a top-of-the-line trade show that the AAEP is known for. I am glad that we can welcome back all our exhibitors so that we can meet face to face and see what new and exciting things they have to offer. Please remember to thank them for their participation, especially our EducationalPartners who are so important in helping us provide the state-of-the-art educational programs that we are ac- customed to. Nashville! What better place to get back together again! There will be no shortage of opportunities to enjoy the social events that are always a part of this convention and Nashville will be a great place to do them. From TheFoundation for The Horse events such as the \"Storytelling Nashville Style \"and the ever-popular Alumni Recep- tions, all the way to the After Party and more, there will be something for everyone to enjoy. Please make themost of it! The last year was full of challenges, some of which will pass. Yet other challenges remain and the leadership of the AAEP will continue to try to work through those challenges. It has been my pleasure and truly an honor to serve as the AAEP 's president during this year. With the help of the wonderful of cers, the highly dedicated board of directors and you, the always willing volunteers of the AAEP, it has made things enjoyable despite the tasks at hand. I also want to thank the staff of the AAEP led by Executive Director David Foley. Without this staff, it would be impossible for this organization to function, no less function as a well-oiled machine. They do their tasks in the background, often barely noticed. The staff of the AAEP is a truly dedicated group of people and I thank themwholeheartedly for making this organization run perfectly. Sincerely, Scott A. Hay, DVM 2021 AAEP President AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 iiiFrom Your President-Elect and Program Chair Welcome to Music City! Nashville provides an ideal backdrop for the 67thAAEP Convention.

However, requests for copies or reprints will be honored by AAEP only with thecooperative permission of the presenting author, who by his or her presentation represents all authors. AAEP reserves the right not to accept any submission without further recourse. Presentations for the AAEP Convention will be selected directly from the review-ready submissions to the AAEP. Submissions may include case series with follow-up data, or the results of experimental or observational studies as scienti c papers, as well as \"How to \"and review papers. Selection will be made by the Scienti c Review & Editorial Committee (SREC). The quality of the submission will determine the selection. Missing data or proposed, but not completed, procedures will exclude the submission from consideration. AAEP invites information dealing with any subject germane to equine practice, but special consid-eration will be given to submissions by practitioners and material with practical content or new information. At least one author of a report describing diagnosis, treatment, or the interpretation of medical information should be a veterinarian. All submissions should strictly adhere to the Instructions for Authors. Submissions will be ranked using the AAEPScoring Criteria (contact cross@aaep.org for this criteria) and the highest-ranking papers will be selected for the available time. Authors are expected to acknowledge all sources of fund- ing or support for the work described and to disclose to theSREC any nancial interest (including ownership, employ- ment, consultancy arrangements, or service as an of cer or board member) they have with companies that manufactureor sell products that gure prominently in the paper or with companies that manufacture or sell competing products.Such an interest will not necessarily in fluence the decision to accept or reject a submission for the program, but must be included in the Acknowledgments section for the con- vention Proceedings. Guidelines: Failure to adhere to the following format will result in non- acceptance. It is the author 's responsibility to convince the SREC of the value of the submission, as well as to portray tothe reader the contents of the presentation. Speci ci n s t r u c - tions for Scienti cp a p e r s , \"How to \"papers, Review papers, Abstracts, and Business papers can be found in their re- spective sections. Format: \u008112 point, Times New Roman font \u0081Double-spaced \u00811\"margins Proceedings should be written in the third person. Avoid the use of the rst person and pronouns such as I, we, my, mine, us, our, ours.Headings should include (but are not limited to) the following: 1. Take Home Message2. Introduction 3. Materials and Methods4. Results 5. Discussion 6. Acknowledgments i. Declaration of Ethics ii. Con flicts of Interest 7. References Title: The title should be 15 words or fewer, at the top and on the rst page. Take Home Message: This should be a concise summary of the main conclusion andshould be no longer than two or three sentences (approxi- mately 50 words). \"How to \"papers do not require a take-home message. Introduction: The rationale for the submission should be given briefl ya n d signicant published work acknowledged here. The clinical signicance should also be included, as well as a clear state- ment of the objective or purpose of the submission. The state-ment of objectives is usually found in the last sentence of the Introduction. Materials and Methods: This section should describe experimental methodology in thecase of a didactic study or, in the case of a clinical study,should include a description of the population from which the animals were selected and how they were selected for inclu- sion in the report.Example of First vs. Third Person:Rather than stating in the first person: \"We concluded from our results that A plus B did not equal C \", use the third person: \"The results of the study indicated that A plus B did not equal C \". Example:Local anesthetic injected into the coffin joint is not selec- tive for only this joint. Such injections will desensitize much of the navicular bone and its suspensory ligaments.Example:Upper Respiratory Dysfunction in Horses During High Speed Exercise vi 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSData obtained and how they were obtained must be described. A description of the statistical methods used to summarize data, test hypotheses, and characterize the signi - cance of results should also be included. Normality of the data should be described, and statistical analysis should be appro- priate for the distribution of the data (parametric or non-para- metric). For weights and measures, metric units should beused. Dosages should be expressed entirely in metric units and with speci c time intervals. Results: Actual results with numbers and data must be presented. When possible, quantify ndings (mean, median, proportion) and present them with appropriate estimates of measurement error or uncertainty (such as standard deviation (SD), standard e r r o r( S E )o rc o n dence interval) in addition to the results of hypothesis testing. If the data can be well represented with agraph or gure, these are encouraged if subsequent publica- tion is not anticipated. If numbers and data are not presented due to concerns regarding publication in a refereed journal, indications of relative differences between groups such as odds ratios, % change, and signi cant differences must be included in the submission to be considered acceptable. In these instances, the authors should submit the data in the form of means, standard deviations, or other descriptions of comparisons among groups in an appendix, which will not bepublished and only used for review purposes. Discussion: Important ndings documented in the results of the study should be stated. Results should be related to other workwhich has been done and how the results differ or agree with previously published work and why any differences may have occurred should be discussed.

Submitted papers that use compounded drugs or medical devices will be reviewed by an individual with expertise in this area. The individual will then make a recommendation to the SREC about the suitability of the submission for potential inclu-sion in the program. Standard of Care: The AAEP is sensitized to having people use the term \"Standard of Care \"from the podium. If you plan to do this, please include this in your abstract or written submitted material so the SRECcan con rm its agreement with your statement. 1. A diagnostic and treatment process that a clinician should follow for a certain type of patient, illness, or clinical cir-cumstance. Adjuvant chemotherapy for lung cancer is \"a new standard of care, but not necessarily the only stand-ard of care. \"(New England Journal of Medicine, 2004). 2. In legal terms, the level at which the average, prudent pro- vider in a given community would practice. It is how simi-larly quali ed practitioners would have managed the patient 's care under the same or similar circumstances. The medical malpractice plaintiff must establish theappropriate standard of care and demonstrate that the standard of care has been breached. Deadline: ALL papers must be submitted online by March 15, 2022, 3:00 p.m. E.T. ; under no circumstances will submis- sions received after the deadline be considered or reviewed.ALL deadlines must be adhered to in order to have the pub-lished Proceedings available at the meeting. Review Process: To respect the integrity of the Annual Convention program andensure the fairness of the review process, AAEP has adopted blind reviewing in which the identity of the authors and reviewers are not known to each other. Papers will be reviewed,scored, and selected by the Scienti c Review & Editorial C o m m i t t e e .P l e a s ef o l l o wt h eb l i n d i n gg u i d e l i n e sb e l o w . Blinding Guidelines: \u0081The title page and/or front matter of the blinded version of the paper should contain no references to any author or to his/her af liation \u0081All unpublished works by an author of the submitted manuscript should be blinded \u0081When referring to an author 's publication, the form of third person should be used \u0081Any acknowledgments section should be removed from the blinded version. Also, please delete any notes that indi- cate af liation, conference presentations, grants, author or departmental websites, etc \u0081Do not use author name or af liation in the names of the submitted les Scoring Criteria: One goal of the SREC in choosing submissions for the AAEPAnnual Convention is to combine the best available clinical research with clinical experience and expertise to meet theneeds of our patients. The AAEP Scoring Criteria can be requested from cross@aaep.org.Pre-Press Approval: Authors will have nal approval at the page proof stage. Changes/updates in numbers, dosages or inappropriate gram- mar may be made within one week of receiving page proofs. Final grammatical changes will be the decision of the editors. Substantial changes or removal of any data will result in for-feiture of complimentary registration and honorarium, and exclusion from the program. Honorarium: Presenting authors will receive one complimentary registra- tion and a check for $550 to help support travel. Mentors for Authors: Paper submissions by private practitioners and rst-time authors are highly encouraged. The AAEP has a list of mem-bers in various areas of expertise who have agreed to volunteer their time to mentor an author who needs guidance. To see this list, email Carey Ross at cross@aaep.org.

Refer to General Instructions for Authors as you prepare your submission. How to papers should be no fewer than 600 words, with no upper word limit. The title should begin with \"How to ...\"and clearly identify the technique or procedure that will be presented. A \"Take Home Message\" is not required for \"How to \"papers. The Introduction should include why you use the technique. If there is a problem with the traditional methods or if the currently used method can be improved, this should be explained. The Materials and Methods section should explain exactly how the technique is performed so that another veterinarianfamiliar with the subject area could follow your example. You may use a step-by-step method for the paper and the presenta- tion. All medications, supplies, and equipment used should be described using generic names. Trade names and addresses ofcommercial products critical to the technique can be included in footnotes. The Results section should include a summary of what hap- pens when you use this technique. The number of horsestreated in this manner and an assessment of the outcome should be included. You may use personal assertions or data to assert its value, but you must explain how you determined that the technique works. In the Discussion section, you can give your personal views as to why you think the technique works. Discuss the prosand cons of your approach. Explain how the technique has helped you in your practice and why this should be important to your colleagues. The end of the discussion should contain as u m m a r yo ft h et e c h n i q u ea n di t sa d v a n t a g e si nt h et a k eh o m e message.

The aim of the paper is to help the membership put the information in perspective, and to makejudgments on con flicting information. A review paper will not principally present original data; the goal is to clarify existing knowledge on a subject and help the membership better use the information in their day-to-day practice. Review papers should generally be formatted as described in the \"General Instructions for Authors \"except where otherwise noted here. The paper should be titled \"Review of Some Subject. \"The content of review articles should be organized with headings and subheadings that provide a logical flow to the material presented. A \"Take Home Message\" is required for a Review Paper. The Introduction should de ne the subject matter and put it in context, explaining why the review is nec- essary. The purpose of the review paper should be clearly stated in the Introduction. Agreement and disagreement within the subject matter should be identi ed along with the strengths and limitationsof the information sources. Reference should be made to the authors who generally support the opinions stated. Theauthor 's perspective, including his/her own interpretation of the information if it is different from previously published opinions, should be included. The end of the discussion should contain a summary and the conclusion that the author has drawn for the audience, based upon the reviewed data. Aswith a Scienti c Paper, a \"Take Home Message\" should be pro- vided by the author that summarizes the practical applicationof the information for the practitioner. An appropriately complete reference list should be included. The format for references is the same as that described in\"General Instructions for Authors. \"Review papers should be no fewer than 600 words, with no upper word limit. Illustrations should be provided in the format described in \"General Instructions for Authors \". If previously published material is submitted, including text, photographs or draw-ings, the author must acknowledge the original source and submit written permission from the copyright holders (author and publisher) to reproduce the material. This permissionmust accompany the original manuscript at the time of submission.

Since the presentation ability of business speakers is crucial, the review for these papers requires a two-step process: 1. Ini- tial acceptance of the paper while the author is blinded. 2. The process becomes un-blinded before nal selections are made. This two-step review process was implemented to protect the association from selecting speakers whose presentations m a yh a v eas t r o n gc o m m e r c i a lb e n d . Blinding Guidelines: \u0081The title page and/or front matter of the blinded version of a paper should contain no references to any author or to his/her af liation. \u0081Any acknowledgments section should be removed fromthe blinded version. Also, please delete any notes thatindicate af liation, conference presentations, author or departmental websites, etc. \u0081Do not use author name or af liation in the names of the submitted les. Scoring Criteria: The subject matter is relevant to the business operations of aveterinary business. How-to cases should be based upon per- sonal experience in a veterinary business. Papers describing a business process should be applicable to an equine veterinary business and should be supported by references from busi- ness publications. Pre-Press Approval: Authors will have nal approval at the page proof stage. Changes/updates may be made within one week of receiving page proofs. Final grammatical changes will be the decision of the editors. Substantial changes or removal of any data will result in forfeiture of complimentary registration, honorarium,and exclusion from the program. Reimbursement: Presenting authors will receive one complimentary registra-tion and a reimbursement of $550 to help support travel.Mentors for Authors: P a p e rs u b m i s s i o n sb yp r i v a t ep r a c t i t i o n e r sa n d rst-time authors are highly encouraged. Please email Carey Ross(cross@aaep.org) to request a list of members in various areas of expertise who have agreed to volunteer their time to mentor an author who needs guidance. \"How to \"Paper Submissions for Business of Practice Sessions: \"How to \"papers are presented to describe and explain a tech- nique or procedure that relates to the business of practice.The goal of these papers is to give equine veterinarians the in- f o r m a t i o nt h e yn e e dt oc r i t i c a l l ye v a l u a t et h ep r o sa n dc o n so f the technique and implement it in their practice if theychoose. \"How to \"papers should follow the same guidelines in this document, except where otherwise noted below.

Introduction As technology improves, portable ultrasonography machines continue to become more affordable andmore readily available. Ultrasonography is a safe and noninvasive diagnostic imaging modality. While ultrasonographic examination of the reproductivetract has become routine, this imaging modality is of- ten underutilized in evaluation of the horse 'st w ol a r g - est body cavities. Unfamiliarity with internal anatomy and interpretation of collected images can seem daunting. However, with repetition, discern- ment between normal and abnormal ndings becomes readily achievable using equipment that a practi-tioner often already owns. Because ultrasonography is limited by the depth that sound waves penetrate, the relatively smaller size of foals facilitates a morecomplete evaluation of the abdominal and thoracic viscera compared to their older and larger counterparts. Moreover, diseases affecting the respi-ratory, gastrointestinal, and urogenital tracts rank among the most common causes of morbidity and mortality for neonatal and juvenile foals. Skillfulemployment of the ultrasound probe will speed up the diagnostic process, lending to sooner and more tar- geted therapeutic intervention. 2. Materials and Methods Prior to beginning an ultrasonographic examination,there are four recommendations that should beheeded to ensure a successful study. These recom- mendations include examination setting, physical and chemical restraint, selection of an appropriate ultraso-nographic probe, and use of a conductivemedium. First, the examination should ideally takeplace in a quiet and dimly lit environment to allowthe practitioner to effectively view the ultrasonogra- phy machine 's display screen. Second, adequate restraint of the foal should be pursued whenever possible. In the author 's opinion, ultrasonography is best accomplished in the standing foal. Thoroughlyimaging a down foal requires repositioning, decreas- ing the ef ciency of the scan compared to performing the study in a tractable standing foal. Restraint can be accomplished by one or two assistants. It is lessstressful for the foal and advantageous for therestrainer to place a hand cranial to the opposite shoulders and scapula rather than across the ventral aspect of the neck (Fig. 1). If the foal 'sd i s p o s i t i o n requires chemical restraint, diazepam (0.1 mg/kg, IV)with or without butorphanol tartrate (0.02 -0.04 mg/ kg, IV) is recommended for sick foals less than 30 days of age and for all foals less than 14 days of age. Incorporation of butorphanol might inducerecumbency. For older foals, xylazine (0.3 -0.5 mg/ kg, IV) will likely be more effective to sedate thepatient for proper examination. Third, selection ofan appropriate ultrasonographic probe is critical to completing an effective examination. In the author 's opinion, a small curvilinear, or microconvex, probe is NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 1HOW TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF ULTRASOUND IN THE FIELDmost appropriate to evaluate the neonatal or juvenile thorax and abdomen (Fig. 2). The microconvexprobe' s higher frequency range allows increased imag- ing detail in relatively super cial planes. The micro- convex probe can reliably penetrate up to 8 to 10 cmdeep. The probe' s smaller footprint ts best in the intercostal spaces of young foals. While rectalprobes and linear probes generally provide aneven higher frequency range, their limited pene-trative abilities can compromise assessment ofdeeper structures. Conversely, these probesprovide excellent detail with a more suitable foot- print for ultrasonographic evaluation of rib frac- tures in neonatal foals. A linear probe ormicroconvex probe is most suitable for evaluation of the umbilical remnants. The large curvilinear, or macroconvex, probe is limited by its lower fre-quency range and larger footprint. The depths towhich this probe can image (up to 30 cm) are often not required during the rst few months of a foal 's life. While the microconvex probe is ideal, any of these probes is appropriate, but the practitionershould be cognizant of the limitations of each. Most ultrasonographic probes have a ridge or LED light on one side of the transducer (Fig.3). This indicator corresponds to the indicator onthe display screen (Fig. 4). Depending on the plane that is being scanned, the indicator should be pointed either laterally, cranially, or dorsally. Lastly,because ultrasonographic waves do not travel readilythrough air, some sort of conductive medium is required during the examination to create a seal between the skin and the ultrasound transducer. Inthe author 's opinion, application of isopropyl alcohol to a foal' s coat, either directly or via a soaked cotton gauze pad, provides suitable images without requiringclipping. Some practitioners prefer to clip the coat,use ultrasonographic coupling gel, or both. Fig. 1. Proper restraint of a 1-day-old foal prior to ultrasono- graphic examination. Fig. 2.

Speci cally, with a normal aerated lung, only the visceral pleural surface is readily imaged. Itshould appear as a linear hyperechoic structure that glides easily along the parietal pleural surface during the respiratory cycle (Fig. 5). Disruptions of the vis-ceral pleural surface are indicative of pulmonarydisease. The author prefers to ultrasonographically evaluate the thorax in a caudal-to-cranial direction, starting dorsally in the most caudal intercostal spacein which pulmonary tissue can be identi ed. The probe should be moved ventrally along each intercos-tal space until abdominal viscera are imaged. The probe should then be moved dorsally to the next inter- costal space cranially; this should be repeated untilthe most cranial extent of the thoracic cavity isreached. It is generally recommended to decreasethe depth of the ultrasonographic eld during the tho- racic examination as tissue deep to the pleural surface cannot be imaged in aerated tissue due to reverbera-tion artifact. It is important to ensure that the pleu-ral surfaces cranial to the heart (approximately thirdand fourth intercostal spaces) are imaged by placingthe transducer in a frontal plane over the triceps muscles (Fig. 6). It becomes necessary to consider- ably increase the depth of the ultrasonographic eld to assess the thoracic cavity in this region. The mostcommon pulmonary pathologies identi ed by ultraso- nography include artifacts, pulmonary con-solidation, pulmonary abscessation, and pleural effusion. Comet tail artifacts indicate roughened regions of the visceral pleural surface and are indica-tive of current or previous pulmonary pathology (Fig.7). While small numbers of comet tail artifacts canbe identi ed in normal foals, coalescing comet tail artifacts are usually indicative of more severepathology. Coalescing comet tail artifacts might be seen in foals with meconium aspiration pneumonia or interstitial pneumonia. Although ultrasonographycannot de nitively diagnose either of these disease processes, these ultrasonographic ndings should prompt further diagnostic efforts, such as clinical lab-oratory work, thoracic radiography, lower airway en-doscopy, and tracheal wash, to identify the nature of pulmonary disease. Pulmonary consolidation allows the imaging of deeper pulmonary tissue due to the ab-sence of air in the foal' s lower airways. It should be remembered that any air prevents ultrasonographicwaves from penetrating more deeply, so partially aer-ated tissue may incompletely obscure deeper pulmo- nary consolidation. Consolidated tissue may therefore only be visible during certain phases of therespiratory cycle. Completely atelectatic pulmonary Fig. 5. Visceral pleural surface in a normal foal. Fig. 6. Placement of an ultrasonographic probe over the left triceps muscle to evaluate the cranial lung elds.HOW TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF ULTRASOUND IN THE FIELD AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 3parenchyma is more readily imaged due to the ab- sence of air and is often described as \"hepatized \"due to its resemblance to the ultrasonographic appearance of the liver and increased conspicuity of the pulmo-nary vasculature (Fig. 8). Pulmonary consolidation is never considered normal. In most cases, pulmo- nary consolidation is indicative of pneumonia. Ifmild with a predominantly subpleural distribution, pulmonary consolidation might be related to decreased surfactant production in neonatalfoals. Additionally, pneumothorax may cause lung collapse, leading to atelectasis. While some causes of pulmonary consolidation can be excluded based onhistory and signalment alone, the presence of this nding is most often indicative of pneumonia or, at the very least, compromised pulmonary tissue that is susceptible to infection. Pulmonary abscesses can be difcult to distinguish from pulmonary consolidation in many instances. Often the distinction is not criti- cal as both ndings are suggestive of a lower airway infection. Only super cial abscesses can be imaged unless overlying pulmonary parenchyma is notaerated. Pulmonary abscesses caused by Rhodococcus equi are often rounded, contain anechoic or hypoechoic debris, and are surrounded by a hypere-choic rim (Fig. 9). Identi cation of pulmonary abscesses in foals susceptible to clinical or subclinical Rhodococcus equi pneumonia (1 -6m o n t h s o f a g e ) should prompt tracheal wash for con rmatory diagnosis. On breeding farms with endemic rhodo- coccosis, it has been demonstrated that the majorityof foals with subclinical R. equi infection will experi- ence therapeuticintervention. 1A scoring system incorporating ultra- sonographic ndings has been to better dif- ferentiate affected foals that may requiretherapy. The reader is directed to the references forfurther information on this topic. 2Pleural effusion refers to the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space. Pleuropneumonia is considerably less com-mon in juveniles compared to adults but is observed Fig. 7. Coalescing comet tail artifacts in a 60-day-old foal. Fig. 8. Consolidated, or hepatized, lung parenchyma (\u00d8) the left cranial lung elds a 42-day-old foal. Fig. 9.

Echogenic pleural effusion should heighten concern of an exudate (Fig. 10). A swirlingappearance of the effusion may be seen in cases of hemothorax that, in neonatal foals, would be observed most frequently in instances of rib fractures. Pleuraleffusion will induce atelectasis of ventral pulmonary parenchyma. Unless strongly sus- pected, thoracocentesis with fluid analysis, cytology, and culture would be the most logical next diagnosticstep to assess the nature of observed pleural effusion. Ultrasonographic Evaluation of the Foal Abdomen The principles guiding ultrasonographic evaluation ofthe foal' s abdominal cavity do not deviate signi - cantly from the examination of the adultabdomen. Examination of the abdomen is best described by breaking the cavity down into three regions: the left flank, the right flank, and the ventrum. Ultrasonographic examination of the leftflank is best initiated caudodorsally in the left paralumbar fossa. The transducer should be ori- entated in a frontal plane and glided ventrally along the flank. This should be repeated in pro- gressively more cranial planes while remaining ventral to the rib cage. In the normal foal, thespleen and left kidney should be readily imaged in the left paralumbar fossa. Along the ventral half of the left flank, the left dorsal and left ventral co- lon can be imaged. Normally, colonic contents include gas in addition to solid and liquid feed, so a reverberation artifact is expected deep to the co-lon wall. Purely liquid colonic digesta supports a diagnosis of enterocolitis. The colonic wall thick- ness can and should be measured in this location;n o r m a lw a l lt h i c k n e s si sl e s st h a nt h a to fa na d u l t(2-3 mm). 3Following examination of the left paralumbar fossa and ventral flank, the intercos- tal spaces should be scanned in a caudal-to-cra-nial direction until no abdominal viscera can be identi ed, which usually occurs near the point of the elbow. Of primary importance in this region is identi cation of the stomach. The stomach can be recognized by its hypoechoic wall; normal wallt h i c k n e s si s2t o4m m . 3The stomach is situated dorsal and slightly medial to the hilus of the spleen and typically does not extend further cau- dally than the 10th to 11th intercostalspaces. While the stomach might extend evenfurther caudally immediately following nursing, a stomach distended with liquid contents in a col- icky foal is an indication for immediate naso-gastric intubation and decompression (Fig. 11). Lastly, a small segment of the liver can be imaged in the left craniolateral abdomen near thesixth to seventh intercostal spaces. In this location, the liver borders the spleen. This serves as a conven- ient site for comparing echogenicity of bothviscera. In the normal foal, hepatic parenchymashould be hypoechoic compared to the spleen. To evaluate the right flank ultrasonographically, thesame technique that is used on the left flank should be employed. In the caudodorsal right paralumbar fossa, the cecum can be imaged; as with the large co-lon, the cecum generally contains some gas, obscuringassessment of its contents. The right dorsal andright ventral colon can be identi ed in the ventral half of the right flank; assessment is similar to that of the left colon. The right kidney is imaged in the cranio-dorsal paralumbar fossa or at the 16th to 17th inter-costal spaces. The right kidney serves as a helpfullandmark for locating a cross-section of the duode-num, which is located just cranioventrally from theright kidney. The duodenum should be assessed formotility and wall thickness (2- 3m m ) . 3The duode- nal lumen may dilate considerably motil-ity but should collapse frequently as peristaltic wavespass (Fig. 12). Turgid distension of the duodenum(greater than 2- 3 cm internal diameter) is indicative of a functional or mechanical intestinal obstruction(Fig. 13). Marked thickening (>5 mm) of the duode-n a lw a l lm i g h tb ei d e n t i ed in juvenile foals affected with impaired gastric emptying caused by Fig. 11.

Normal duodenum (*) adjacent to liver.HOW TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF ULTRASOUND IN THE FIELD AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 5gastroduodenal ulceration (Fig. 14). The presence of hyperechoic echoes in the bowel wall indicates intramural gas and is de ned as pneumat- osis intestinalis. This nding should heighten the practitioner' s suspicion of necrotizing enterocolitis. The liver is best studied along theventral intercostal spaces of the right flank. The liver should be assessed for appropriate echogenicity and echotecture; the walls of the portal vasculatureshould be hyperechoic relative to the hepatic paren- chyma, and the liver margins should be sharp, not extending beyond the costochondral junctions.Ultrasonographic examination of the ventrum, includ-ing the inguinal areas, is critical as identi cation of free peritoneal fluid and fluid-lled distended bowel is most frequently identi ed in thislocation. Evaluation of the foal 'sv e n t r u mi sb e s t accomplished by placing the ultrasound trans- ducer in a transverse plane in the left cranioven-tral abdomen. The transducer should be movedin a cranial-to-caudal direction toward the pelvicinlet. This should be repeated in rightwardplanes until the entirety of the ventral abdomenhas been examined. In the ventral abdomen, thepractitioner should be able to identify the left andright ventral colons. Small intestinal loops arefrequently identi ed in ventral abdomen and inguinal regions; assessment of small intestinalloops in this area is identical to assessment of theduodenum (Fig. 15). Certain small intestinalabnormalities may heighten concern of a mechani-cal obstruction. These include the classic \"tar- get \"lesion characteristic of intussusceptions or t h ep r e s e n c eo f \"two populations \"of bowel in which some small intestinal loops are amotile anddistended while other loops remain collapsed anddevoid of ingesta. It has been demonstrated thatintussusceptions may be identi ed incidentally in Fig. 15.

The bladder can beimaged in the inguinal regions at the pelvicinlet. The diameter of the bladder can vary consider-ably (up to 10 cm in a neonatal foal). Urine is typi-cally anechoic but will have an echogenic appearanceduring the rst 12 to 24 hours of life. Large volumes of free peritoneal fluid may be imaged in the ventral abdomen and inguinal regions; potential causes ofincreased peritoneal effusion are numerous and arebest differentiated by fluid analysis, cytology, and cul- ture via abdominocentesis. Lastly, and unique to thefoal, evaluation of the internal umbilical remnantsshould be included in the abdominal ultrasonographicexamination. Examination should begin with thetransducer held in a transverse plane just caudal tothe external umbilical remnants. Identi cation of the internal stump, including the urachus, umbilicalarteries, and umbilical vein, is facilitated by angling the transducer slightly cranially (Fig. 16). The transducer can then be moved caudally to follow theurachus and umbilical arteries to their insertion atthe bladder. To assess the umbilical vein, the trans-ducer should be held in a transverse plane just cranialto the external umbilical remnants. The transducershould be moved cranially in a transverse plane alongthe ventral midline, following the single umbilical veinremnant. It may be necessary to move the trans-ducer slightly to the left or right of the midline whilecoursing cranially to keep the umbilical vein remnantin the center of the screen. The remnant should befollowed all the way to its insertion at the liver. Theumbilical remnants should be assessed for size andstructure. The internal umbilical remnants can de-velop into abscesses secondary to ascending infectionor spread of hematogenous infection. Indications ofan umbilical infection include enlargement of the internal structures or the presence of sedimented ma- terial or gas in the internal structures (Fig.17). Importantly, a normal external umbilical rem-nant does not preclude the possibility for severe inter-nal umbilical remnant infection. During the rst week of life, the internal umbilical remnant diametershould be less than 24 mm, and the umbilical vein di-ameter should be less than 10 mm. 4The internal remnants should gradually regress and should be dif - cult to detect by 5 to 6 weeks of age.5 3. Discussion Ultrasonographic ndings from the thorax and abdo- men can provide the practitioner with a considerableamount of information when confronted with a sickfoal in a stall-side setting. While ultrasonographicassessment is complex and requires skill and practice, approaching each examination in a methodical and consistent order should allow the practitioner to gaincomfort in interpretation of images and differentiationbetween normal and abnormal.

Sonographic eval-uation of the equine thoracic and abdominal cavities provides diagnostic information, the value of which is heavily in fluenced by the preparation of the patient and the technique and experience of the ex- aminer. These proceedings will outline key strat- egies for making the most of thoracic and abdominalultrasonography in the horse with considerations of case selection, patient preparation, equipment requirements, and examination technique. 2. Materials and Methods Case selection involves understanding both manifes- tations of disease and the limitations of sonography as a modality. By far, the most common application ofabdominal sonography in equine practice is the horse with acute signs of abdominal pain. For these patients, speci ci n f o r m a t i o ni sd e s i r e dt om a k ear a p i d determination as to how to achieve the best outcome for the patient (referral vs on-farm treatment, surgical vs medical management vs euthanasia). The mostappropriate approach to these patients is a limited, rapid examination that ef ciently and speci cally addresses these concerns. The fast localized abdomi- nal sonography for horses (FLASH) technique achieves these goals in a systematic examination in seven dis- crete windows. Evaluation of the anatomy in thesewindows gives the examiner important data about the likelihood of a colonic displacement, distention of the stomach and/or small intestine, and the presence or ab-sence of peritoneal and pleural effusions and requiresonly around 10 minutes to perform. 1As effective a tool as FLASH is at providing information about acutecolic, however, it is inappropriate to apply this tech- nique to other applications for abdominal sonography, including fever, chronic colic, diarrhea, liver or kidneydysfunction, anemia, abdominal distention, weightloss, and hypoproteinemia. To obtain meaningful in-formation for aiding in the investigation of these clini- cal presentations, a full abdominal ultrasound is indicated. A comprehensive abdominal ultrasound istime consuming; to fully scrutinize each intercostalspace and the ventral abdomen, up to one hour maybe required. To maximize the use of this technique, the sonographer must also possess a commanding knowledge of the anatomy and suf cient experience to accurately interpret subtle alterations of theanatomy. Indications for thoracic ultrasound includefever, tachypnea, cough, sternal edema, pleurodynia, and a of suspicion of rib frac- tures, hemothorax, or pneumothorax. Pulmonarylesions are detected sonographically only if theyextend to the pleural surface, and lesions that are con-ned to the airways, deep to air- lled parenchyma, such as equine asthma, are not sonographically accessible. Ultrasound evaluation of the thorax is most useful for detecting pleural effusion, rib NOTES 8 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF ULTRASOUND IN THE FIELDfractures, and infections and neoplastic processes that occur at the pleural surface. Familiarity with the anatomy of the pleural space and diaphragm isrequired to accurately interpret the imagesobtained. Regardless of the type of examination, proper, thorough patient preparation is essential for the acquisition of high-quality images. Forideal image quality, as much of the haircoat aspossible should be removed by clipping with a #40 blade and the skin washed with soap and warm water. Application of gel to the skin provides acoupling substrate. Warming the gel prior toapplication promotes vasodilation in the skin and therefore improves transmission of sound waves. If clipping is not possible, the haircoatshould at least be brushed thoroughly to removedirt and debris, as dirt will block the transmission of sound waves. If not clipping, one should use isopropyl alcohol or warm water instead of gel towet the hair and provide a coupling substrate(Fig. 1). When using alcohol, especially in cool environments, evaporation will cause piloerection and impede further imaging, even when alcohol isreapplied. Thus, applying alcohol to one smallarea at a time as that area is being evaluated is strongly recommended over dousing the entire side of the horse at the beginning of theexamination. Visceral gas is a major impedimentto visualization of the abdominal contents of the horse. Additionally, the small intestine is a com- mon site for digestive dysfunction, resulting inweight loss, protein loss, and chronic intermittentcolic, but is frequently poorly visualized due to co- lonic gas, its anatomic location, and the presence of ingesta within the small intestinallumen. Fasting has been shown to have theeffect of both reducing gas in the large colon and slowing the peristalsis of the small intestine, which favors it sinking to the ventral abdomenwhere it can be more readily examined. 2,3This effect has been demonstrated to improve meas-ures of small intestinal visibility and de nition,3 and although improvement of the visibility ofother organs has not been critically assessed,fasting may also improve imaging access to other organs, such as the liver. Circumstances obvi- ously prevent a pre-examination fast in acutecolic, but all horses undergoing scheduled full ab-dominal sonography should be fasted (with free access to water) for at least 12 hours before the exam. If ultrasound and gastroscopy are beingperformed at the same visit, ultrasound wouldideally be performed r s tt oa v o i dt h ei m p e d i m e n t of insuf fla t e dg a si nt h es t o m a c ha n ds m a l l intestine. The astounding advances in imagingtechnology have opened up a variety of options tothe equine practitioner. To perform a thorough abdominal examination, a low-frequency trans- d u c e ro fe i t h e rc u r v i l i n e a ro rs e c t o rc o n guration is ideal. The advantage of these con gurations is the pie-shaped image, which provides a wide image window through a relatively small transcu- taneous footprint. Linear probes (e.g., \"tendon \" or\"rectal \"transducers) can be used for thoracic evaluation and can be used to obtain limited infor- mation about the abdominal cavity, but they have insuf cient depth/power to penetrate the deeper tissues of the abdomen. Because the pleural sur-face is relatively close to the body surface, higher frequency transducers can be very useful for tho- racic evaluation, but a curvilinear con guration remains the preferred choice due to the increasedwidth of anatomy that can be evaluated at one time (Fig. 2). A linear transducer is often the ideal choice for evaluating the ribs when fractures are suspected,however. Many ultrasound systems have presetexam settings, which are a great starting place, but they cannot account for all of the physical (overall size, breed, and adiposity) and physiological (hydra-tion and ambient temperature) differences betweenpatients. This means that the examiner is required to\"nesse \"the settings to account for these differen- ces and to account for the depths and densities of vari- ous organs. Settings that are frequently adjustedinclude depth, frequency, focus, gain, and time/gaincompensation. Depth should generally be adjusted so that the organ of interest just lls the screen; this maximizes the information contained in the viewing Fig. 1. Effect of patient preparation for equine abdominal sonography. These images were obtained minutes apart from the same horse with no change in machine settings. A, Obtained with isopropyl alcohol applied to clean, unclipped hair. B, Obtained withultrasound coupling gel applied to skin after clipping with a #40 blade.HOW TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF ULTRASOUND IN THE FIELD AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 9area (Fig. 3). Because of the various sizes and loca- tions of abdominal organs within the body, depth is constantly adjusted in the course of abdominalsonography. The \"frequency\" refers to the number of sound waves that pass a xed point per second. As frequency increases, the level of detail in the imageincreases, but the ability of the sound waves to pene-trate tissue decreases. Therefore, frequency shouldbe adjusted to the highest frequency that yields adiagnostic image at the required depth. Like depth,frequency is adjusted up and down to accommodatevariable depths and tissue densities throughout theabdominal scan. Focus refers to the region of thescreen that has the best resolution, which is analo- gous to the focus of a camera. For most systems, the zone in focus is indicated with a cursor on the right ofthe screen and may be single or multiple. Use ofmore than two focal zones slows processing speed,defeats the purpose of bringing the object of interestinto focus, and is therefore not recommended. Oncertain systems, the zone in focus is always the areain the center between the most super cial structures and the limit of depth. When using these systems,adjusting the depth also has the function of changingthe focus. Gain is the brightness of the image. Itshould not be altered until after the frequency has been optimized. Time/gain compensation changes the gain throughout the depth of the image, which isespecially important to use when evaluating deeperstructures to produce an image with even brightnessthroughout and not overly bright in the super cial structures and not bright enough in the deeperones. This principle can also be used in reverse incases of effusion when acoustic enhancement resultsin the deeper structures to be overgained. Thoracicsonography generally requires less manipulation ofthe images during the examination due to the factt h a tt h ep l e u r a ls u r f a c ei sg e n e r a l l yt h es o l eo b j e c to finterest and occurs at a roughly consistent depth. In the case of pathology, however, adjustments will need to be made as in abdominal sonography. Regardlessof what is being evaluated, labels are required to iden-tify (at least) the anatomic location in the image andthe orientation of the transducer with respect to thepatient 's body. The anatomic location seems logical and obvious when the anatomy is normal but is oftenneither in pathologic states. The label should indi-cate the side of the horse and the general region andprovide more information if relevant. For thoracicimaging, it is useful to divide the trunk into thirds Fig. 2. Comparison of a thoracic ultrasound image obtained with a curvilinear transducer and straight linear transducer. Note that both are diagnostic quality images.

For the examina-tion, as for any examination, the practitioner should follow the same pattern each time to maximize muscle memory and to avoid errors. This pattern shouldbe logical and easy to the operator; no one systemis perfect for everyone. The author begins everyevaluation on the left side in the most dorsal imag-ing window; for the abdomen, this is the left paral-umbar fossa, and for the thorax, this is the left 15 th intercostal space just ventral to the epaxialmusculature. The examination proceeds by slid-ing down each intercostal space from dorsal to ven-tral and then, for the abdominal evaluation, slidingfrom cranial to caudal (e.g., with the hair) along theventral abdomen. When evaluating the thorax, theauthor interrogates each intercostal startingdorsally at the epaxial muscles and terminating atthe diaphragm. Care is needed in both thoracicand abdominal sonography to orient the transducerparallel in the intercostal space and perpendicularto the organ of interest. A fanning techniquewithin intercostal spaces is useful to obtain imagescranial and caudal to the intercostal spaces. Whenperforming these examinations, images should besaved even when the anatomy appears to benormal. Representative images of the normal ab-domen include at a minimum the nephrosplenicspace, (including the entire left kidney), the tail ofthe spleen, the stomach, the liver/spleen interface,the right kidney and duodenum, the right dorsalcolon adjacent to the liver, and the ventralabdomen. Representative images of the normalthorax include at a minimum a sampling of intercos-tal spaces at the level of the diaphragm; the authorgenerally collects images at the 12 th,8th, and 6thin- tercostal spaces on each side of the thorax. Whenpathology is noted, more images are generally required to demonstrate the nature and extent ofthe abnormalities. Extremely abnormal ndings may require additional annotation for clarity. 3. Results/Discussion Abdominal and thoracic ultrasound provide useful diagnostic and prognostic information in both acute and chronic disease. Careful case selection, thoroughpatient preparation, knowledge of machine settings, accurate annotation, and well-practiced technique are all key elements of making the most of this imagingmodality.

Introduction Lameness in foals can be extremely frustrating when t h es o u r c eo fl a m e n e s si sn o tr e a d i l ya p p a r e n t . T h e clinical presentation of a traumatic insult can be simi- lar to that of a septic process, so accurate and prompt diagnosis of the underlying problem is important to administer appropriate treatment to minimize mor- bidity and mortality. Proximal limbs are more chal-lenging to assess, as soft tissue swelling and/or effusion can be dif cult or impossible to palpate dur- ing a physical examination. Ultrasound examina-t i o no ft h el a m ef o a lc a np r o v i d ev a l u a b l ei n f o r m a t i o n that assists with a de nitive diagnosis of the cause of lameness using equipment that many practitionershave readily available to them. 2. Materials and Methods If at all possible, the region of interest should beclipped to maximize image quality and diagnostic yield. The clipped area should be cleaned with iso- propyl alcohol or soap and water and acoustic cou- pling gel applied. Sedation may be helpful if the foal is fractious. A linear tendon probe is generally appropriate for the distal limbs, stifl e, elbow, and shoulder region. In younger or smaller foals, it mayalso be possible to image the pelvis with a linear probe. If a linear probe cannot provide the penetra- tion required to image deeper structures, a lower fre- quency curvilinear probe may be necessary. Thespecic frequency, depth, gain, and other machine set- tings should be optimized for each patient and bodyregion. A systematic approach is helpful for evaluat- i n ge a c hb o d yr e g i o n . S p e c i c anatomic structures to evaluate include the following: bony margins, physes,articular cartilage, synovial fluid, synovial membrane, tendons and ligaments, the subcutaneous tissues, andmuscle layers. Particularly challenging areas in foalsare any places where ossi cation has not been com- pleted (e.g., limb of interest to the contralateral limb isextremely helpful for determining if a suspicious areais abnormal. 3. Results Some general principles apply to ultrasonographic ex-amination of the lame foal. A wide variety of abnor-malities of a region can produce a similar clinicalpresentation, namely, lameness, soft tissue swelling,and sensitivity to palpation or flexion. The goal of the ultrasonographic examination is to identify spe-cic abnormalities and therefore narrow down the list of differential diagnoses, while recognizing that addi-tional tests (e.g., radiography, synoviocentesis andfluid analysis, and hematology) may be necessary as well. A region can be divided into the following fourmajor categories: subcutaneous tissues/muscle, ten-dons and ligaments, synovial structures, andbones. One or more of these structures may beabnormal and provide clues as to the source oflameness. Generalized subcutaneous thickeningis often a nonspeci cnding. 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF ULTRASOUND IN THE FIELDsubcutaneous edema may indicate a cellulitis (Fig. 1), and a focal encapsulated pocket may represent an ab-scess or seroma (Fig. 2). Foreign bodies may be iden-tied in any layer of tissue even if a puncture wound is not immediately apparent (Fig. 3), and ultrasonog-raphy is more helpful than radiography in cases of nonmetallic foreign bodies. 1Although tendon or lig- ament injury is relatively uncommon in foals, it does occur (Fig. 4). The injury may be traumatic in na-ture or secondary to sepsis. Synovial effusion and sy-novial membrane proliferation are hallmarks ofsynovitis due to a variety of causes (Fig. 5). 2,3In foals,a septic synovitis is often the culprit. Echogenicity ofsynovial fluid is a poor predictor of synovial sepsis in horses,2and any suspicious effusion should be further Fig. 1.

Although joints are often the rst synovial structures that come to mind, bursas and tendon sheaths should alsobe assessed and sampled accordingly (Fig.6). Ultrasound is an excellent tool with which toassess bony margins. Areas of irregularity consist-ent with osteomyelitis may be identi ed readily with ultrasound, sometimes prior to abnormalities becom-ing apparent radiographically (Fig. 7). 4Widening and irregularity of physes due to septic physitis mayalso be observed (Fig. 8). Bony margin discontinu-ities consistent with fracture can be appreciated,which are particularly useful in areas that are morechallenging to radiograph, such as the pelvis ed using ultrasonography, even when radiographic images are normal or equivocal. 5,6The presentation of early osteochondrosis can be identicalto that of a septic joint, with lameness and largeamounts of synovial effusion. The nding of fluid analysis with an ultrasonographicallyidenti ed osteochondrosis lesion can change the course of treatment in these cases. 4. Discussion In the author 's practice, ultrasonography is routinely incorporated into the diagnostic approach for lame foals. It is readily available, noninvasive, and gener- ally well tolerated by the patient (sometimes with theaid of sedation). The information gained often guidesthe subsequent diagnostic workup, which can ef - ciently focus tests that involve more invasive proce- dures on targeted sites of concern. For example, in a foal with diffuse fetlock region swelling, ultrasono-graphic ndings can determine if a synovial structure is sampled, which synovial structure is sampled (e.g. fetlock joint, digital flexor proximal or or if an abscess or cellulitis is present in the absence of sy-novial effusion and synovial sampling is not indicatedat the time but drain placement is indicated.

This is particularly challenging infoals, who are constantly growing and changing.Comparisons between the limb of interest and thecontralateral limb are extremely helpful when tryingto determine if a nding is a true abnormality or is normal for a particular foal at its current stage ofgrowth. For example, the thickness and appearanceof cartilage is variable, even between foals of similarages, 7and comparison to the contralateral (normal) limb can prevent a misdiagnosis or allow recognitionof a clinically relevant abnormality.Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of Veterinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Introduction The suspensory ligament of the hind limb is an impor- tant source of lameness in the horse. Suspensoryinjury (or desmitis ) most often occurs due to repetitive stress associated with work but may also occur sec-ondarily to direct trauma. Often this trauma is asso-ciated with splint bone fractures. 1A detailed clinical examination including diagnostic analgesia and diag-nostic imaging is necessary to provide an accuratediagnosis. Determining the full extent of injuryfrequently requires multiple diagnostic imagingmodalities. At a minimum, radiology should be usedto assess bony involvement, whereas ultrasonographyshould be used to evaluate the soft tissuestructures. It should be noted that these imagingtools provide complementary information about a sus-pensory ligament injury, as desmitis often occurs atthe sites of insertion onto the metatarsal bones and/orthe proximal sesamoid bones. A more complete diag-nosis of suspensory ligament injury may require theuse of more advanced imaging techniques such as nu-clear scintigraphy and magnetic resonance imaging(MRI). 2,3Once a diagnosis is made, the information is used to make a comprehensive treatment plan as wellas a realistic prognosis for the owner.1 Anatomy The hind limb suspensory ligament is similar to theforelimb in that it is referred to anatomically as threeregions: the proximal region or origin, the body, andthe branches. The origin of the suspensory ligamenton the hind limb is at the proximoplantar aspect of the third metatarsal bone. There is a small exten-sion of the ligament that originates more proximallyon the plantar aspect of the fourth tarsal bone that isreferred to as the accessory ligament of the suspen- sory ligament or tarsal extension of the suspensory ligament. 1The suspensory ligament is composed of ligament bers with fat and muscle distributed throughout. The fat and muscle are in similar loca-tions in all horses but not always identical evenbetween legs of the same horse. 2,4At the origin of the ligament on the third metatarsal bone the ligament begins in a triangular shape that quickly becomes heart shaped just distal to the origin. In this proxi-mal region, the suspensory ligament is closely associ-ated with the fourth metatarsal bone with themajority of the ligament lying lateral of midline. Asthe ligament continues distally into the body of theligament, it becomes oval shaped until it bifurcates into a medial and lateral branch approximately two thirds of the way distal in the metatarsal region. 2 The branches begin proximally as circular structuresa n db e c o m em o r et r i a n g u l a rs h a p ei nt h em i da s p e c tof the branch until they insert on the respective proxi-mal sesamoid bone. Ultrasound Machine As with all ultrasound examinations, it is important to begin with the appropriate probe and preset selec- tion on the ultrasound machine to optimize the imagequality. A high frequency (7 -13 MHz) linear trans- ducer is used for the examination to assist in higher NOTES 16 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF ULTRASOUND IN THE FIELDimage resolution.5Patient preparation with clipping and a detergent scrub of the skin are critical to opti- mize image quality. In addition, a standoff may beused to assist with contact (increasing the footprint)throughout the weight-bearing portion of the examination. The frequency, focal zones, depth, and gain should be adjusted to optimize the imagethroughout the examination. 5 2. Ultrasound Examination A complete examination of the hind limb suspensory ligament includes an evaluation of the proximal sus- pensory ligament including its origin on the plantar aspect of the third metatarsal bone, the body of the suspensory ligament, the suspensory branches, andtheir insertion on the proximal sesamoid bones. Afull examination not only includes all of these ana-tomic locations, but also a weight-bearing and a non- weight-bearing component. 2,6The examination should be performed in the transverse and longitudinal plane, especially when con rming the presence of a discrete lesion. The ligament should be comparedbetween the right and left hind limb to assist in estab- lishing normal patient variations, changes in size, or to con rm the presence of a lesion. Throughout its entirety, the suspensory ligament is evaluated forchanges in size, shape, ber pattern, and margins. Angled contrast ultrasonography has beenproven an effective technique to more clearly delin- eate the ligament margins, as well as the surrounding tissues that may be associated with adhesionformation. Angle contrast ultrasonography is alsouseful in the proximal aspect as well as the body ofthe suspensory ligament to distinguish the ligament bers from the fat and muscle dispersed throughout the ligament, as these tissues are less angle depend- ent than the ligament bers. 6 Proximal The proximal suspensory ligament is historically a more dif cult region to ultrasound as well as con - dently diagnose abnormalities. Getting a clear visu- alization of the proximal suspensory ligament canprove dif cult due to its position deep to the flexor ten- dons, check ligament, and large tortuous vessels. All of the previously described structures between the suspensory ligament and the ultrasound transducercreate signi cant edge artifacts within the ligament due to the differences in echogenicity, ber orienta- tion, and acoustic impedance. 2Because of these pre- viously described dif culties, MRI examination remains the gold standard for imaging the proximalsuspensory region when a horse 'sl a m e n e s si sl o c a l - ized to this region.3,7It is important to also note that the tarsal extension is dif cult to see ultrasonographi- cally, and injuries in this location are normally diag- n o s e dw i t ha nM R I . T ob e g i nt h ee x a m ,t h e transducer is placed just distal to the chestnut or atthe level of the tarsometatarsal joint. The fourthmetatarsal bone is large and wraps around theplantar aspect of the proximal suspensory ligament; therefore the ultrasound transducer is placed on the plantar medial aspect of the leg to better visualize the suspensory ligament (Fig. 1). 2The origin of the liga- ment on the plantar aspect of the third metatarsalbone is an important part of the examination andshould be assessed thoroughly both in the transverse and longitudinal plane. Fiber irregularities are most commonly seen at the osseous margin of the origin ofthe ligament. 3These changes can be seen as either hypoechoic areas consistent with ber disruption or hyperechoic areas indicative of more chronic changes such as scarring and mineralization (Fig. 2). The os- seous margin should also be carefully scrutinized forirregularities. A radiographic study of the proximalmetatarsal region can further support these changesseen as sclerosis or resorption of the bone at the origin or potentially more severe changes such as an avul- sion fragment or stress fracture. It is also importantto evaluate for signs of soft tissue proliferation aroundthe suspensory ligament as this may be suggestive ofbrosis and potential adhesion formation. One study comparing ultrasound to gross pathology found ultra- sound to underestimate the presence of substantial adhesion formation between the suspensory ligamentand surrounding structures which may in fluence the horse 'sp r o g n o s i s . 8As discussed previously, angle contrast ultrasonography or placing the ultrasound beam angle off-incidence may assist in separating out the margins of the suspensory ligament from sur-rounding soft tissues therefore potentially detectingadhesion formation. Visualizing the margins moreclearly with angle contrast ultrasonography may also help con rm enlargement of the ligament. 6To visu- alize the suspensory ligament more thoroughly it should be evaluated with the limb off-weighted ornon-weight-bearing. In the hind limb, this can be Fig. 1. Transverse image of the suspensory ligament proximal body. While weight-bearing, proximal suspensory is best visualized from the plantar medial approach.

This allows theflexor tendons to relax and move slightly to pro- vide a more complete window to visualize the suspen-sory ligament (Fig. 3). In addition, the suspensoryligament becomes closer to the transducer providingimprovement in the image resolution. 2Body The body of the hind suspensory ligament is an ovoidtendinous structure with a central bundle of ligament bers and a zigzag pattern of fat and muscle distrib- uted across it.4The body of the ligament can be visualized more easily than the origin of theligament. Lesions in this area are seen most fre-quently as both ber changes and enlargement in the cross-sectional area of the ligament. Because of thelocation in the limb and its association with the sec-ond and fourth metatarsal bones, the body of the sus-pensory ligament is commonly affected in association with splint bone fractures or axial osseous prolifera- ofthe second or fourth metatarsal bones may have moreaxial bone proliferation than can be seen radiographically. 2,9The medial and lateral margins of the suspensory ligament should be scrutinized adja- cent to the osseous changes for ber changes as well as for surrounding soft tissue proliferation that can be adhesion formation. Ultrasound can be used to determine the degree of axial bone proliferation and ifthere is impingement of the bone into the suspensoryligament that may be a chronic source of lameness. 1,9 Suspensory Branches To optimize visualization of each suspensory branch t h e ya r ee v a l u a t e df r o mt h er e s p e c t i v em e d i a la n dl a t - eral aspect of the limb one branch at a time.Because of the super cial location of the branch and the contour of the leg in this region, a standoff is needed to get adequate contact and allow complete visualization of the margins. The branches shouldbe evaluated in a systematic approach from the proxi-mal aspect at the bifurcation to the distal aspect at the insertion on the corresponding sesamoid bone. The branches are evaluated throughout theirlength for changes, as discussed before, as well asmore diffuse ber abnormalities. The margins of the Fig. 2.

Periligamentous brosis is seen more com- monly in the hind limbs and is important to considerwhen determining prognosis as it is associated with adecreased prognosis. 10At the insertion of the branches onto their respective sesamoid bones, specialattention should be given to changes in ber pattern as well as the osseous margin. The longitudinalplane is helpful in this location when assessing thelength of the insertion on the abaxial margin of thesesamoid bone. More chronic changes associatedwith enthesopathy include disruption of the bone sug- gestive of resorption and mineralization within the ligament due to abnormal healing (Fig. 5). Whenchanges are seen at the insertion of the suspensory branch, especially when affecting the osseous margin, a radiographic study of the fetlock should be per-formed to see the extent of the osseouschanges. With the addition of radiographic lesions such as extensive resorption, osseous cyst-like lesions, or avulsion fragments will be more easilyidenti ed. Other techniques have been described to evaluate the suspensory branches besides the tradi- tional gray-scale weight-bearing weight-bearing approach has been described whenevaluating suspensory branches to identify certain longitudinal splits as well as providing more accurate information when determining lesion severity in thisregion. 11It is important to note while evaluating the suspensory branches, ultrasonographic abnormalities do not always cause clinical lameness.10,12,13In the author 's experience, besides using clinical judgment, Power Doppler can be bene cial when trying to deter- mine if a lesion is active. Increased vascularity within the ligament can be correlated with clinical disease or lameness. There is little research cur-rently on using Power Doppler in horses this way. However, there is one descriptive study that examined the suspensory branches of 13 horses withPower Doppler. In all branches that were abnormalon gray-scale ultrasound, Power Doppler signal was identi ed, whereas no Power Doppler signal was iden- tied in branches that were normal on gray-scale imaging. The imaging ndings were not correlated to soundness in this study, however, this study didprovide justi cation to further investigate using Doppler in tendon/ligament injuries. 14 3. Conclusion Ultrasound is a useful tool to examine the suspensory ligament in the equine hind limb. There are inher- ent dif culties while performing an ultrasound exam of the suspensory ligament and therefore more techni-ques than the standard plantar weight-bearing approach should be utilized.

Introduction Soft tissue injuries in the pastern region are a signi - cant contributor to lameness and loss of use or perform- ance.1-3Ultrasound has been well established as a useful method for diagnosing soft tissue injuries in thehorse. Ultrasound of the pastern requires slightly more technical probe handling skills and skills in rec- ognizing variabilities than that of the metacarpalregion, but with the current equipment capabilities and level of ultrasound familiarity amongst most prac- titioners, ultrasound of the pastern can and should be undertaken in the eld with reasonable diagnostic expectation. Although magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) is considered the gold standard for musculoskel- etal imaging of the distal limb, ultrasound as a primary method of soft imaging remains nancially and often logistically more practical for many clients. The nd- ings provided by a good-quality diagnostic ultrasound in the eld may be able to provide a stand-alone diagnosis. If MRI is also an option, the ultrasoundndings can be used as a platform to discuss the merits of additional MR imaging and help to better direct thearea of interest of a potential MRI study. Post MRI, pastern ultrasound can be used to guide intralesional therapy and is generally the standard method for mon-itoring lesion healing and guiding rehabilitation proto- cols at the frequency required for proper rehabilitation. 2. Area of Interest (P1/P2) For practical reasons, examination of the pastern isdivided into imaging of the structures of palmar P1and very proximal P2 and imaging of the structures at mid-P2 and distally to the podotrochlearregion. The soft tissue structures palmar to P1 arebest a high-frequency linear or 9-11 MHz), with variable use of astandoff pad. A small footprint rectal linear trans-ducer can be used in some instances, but overall, theshape of the transducer is less amenable to imagingall structures in the longitudinal and transverseplanes. To visualize structures distal to the veryproximal portion of P2 (middle scutum), the probe hasto be placed at the level of the heel bulbs, and a smallfootprint curvilinear or microconvex probe is requiredin order to have adequate contact. This presentationwill focus on the basics of ultrasound of the palmarpastern region using a linear probe available to mostpractitioners with a brief example of what can bevisualized at the level of P2. The fore- and hindlimbsare anatomically similar and treated as such for scan- ning technique. 3.

Soft tissue lesions in the pas- tern may respond to palmar digital, abaxial (basi-ses- amoid), or even low palmar/plantar diagnosticanalgesia depending on location, severity of theinjury, or migration of the blocking agent; one mustbe careful to evaluate all structures that may poten-tially be affected by those blocks. Horses with a poten-tial radiographic diagnosis but who aredisproportionately lame or chronically lame in theface of appropriate therapy should also be evaluatedfor a soft tissue lesion. Lastly, soft tissue causationshould be suspected in horses who have recurrentlameness in a shorter than expected therapeutic win-dow following intra-articular or intrathecal medica-tion/therapy.

Preparation The pastern should be carefully clipped with a num- ber 40 surgical blade, cleaned, and ample gel applied. The clipped area should extend from thedistal metacarpus/tarsus to the heel bulbs along the palmar, palmaromedial, and palmarolateral aspects (Fig. 3). The pastern is a very dif cult region toadequately image in an unclipped horse. Careful attention should be paid to the basi-sesamoid region and any whorls or unusual hair direction. Chronic dermatitis, thick skin, and scar tissue impede pene-tration of the ultrasound beam and can result in dif - culty obtaining adequate images. 6. Technique Each structure should be evaluated separately to allow for appropriate incidence angle, frequency, and focal zone location.

As with any tendon or ligament, size, shape, echogenicity, andber, alignment should be evaluated critically. Cross- sectional area measurements and/or dorsal to palmar/ plantar thickness can be performed on structures that are suspected of being abnormal. Contralateral Fig. 9.

A standoff pad can be helpful to evaluate the SDFT and other super cial structures and in petite horses or ponies (Fig. 6).

Deep Digital Flexor Tendon The DDFT is one of the two most commonly injured structures in the pastern3,4and is more commonly injured in the forelimb than the hindlimb. It is located directly palmar/plantar and normally demon- strates a homogenous echogenicity with symmetric lobular appearance and long linear bers. Some twisting of the bers is normally apparent on longitu- dinal views. Begin with the transducer in atransverse plane, focal zones at appropriate depth, and a standoff pad if needed. Angling upward just under the ergot, the probe should then be moved dis- tally with adjustments for incidence angle until the level of heel bulbs (usually at the level of proximal P2). Proximally, the DDFT may appear hypoechoic due to off-incidence image, and care should be taken to manipulate incidence angle as best as possible and to understand the normal variation. While evaluat-ing the DDFT at P1 and proximal P2, any lobe asym- metry or subtle differences in echogenicity or shape is Fig. 15. 1, Probe position for transverse image of the lateral branch of the SDFT. 2, Transverse image of SDFT at level of P1 prior to branching. 3, Transverse image with probe slid laterally to center over lateral aspect of the SDFT to follow the lateral branchdistally.

If the classic echogenic appear- ance cannot be obtained at the level of P2, valuable in- formation can be gained by rocking the probe distally and using the off-incidence view to evaluate shape a n ds y m m e t r yt oo b t a i na ni n d e xo fs u s p i c i o no fi n j u r y further distal. This type of off-incidence appearance is also helpful in determining the margins of the DFTS and the presence of any mineralization or brosis. The probe should then be turned 90\u00b0 to the longitudinal view. Care should be taken to centerthe probe and evaluate each lobe separately in the longitudinal plane, particularly if a lesion is suspectedin a particular lobe. Due to the narrow beam widthrelative to the width of the tendon when the probe isoriented in a sagittal plane, it can be dif cult to con- rm the lesion in both planes if one does not pay adequate attention to the lateral or medial positioning of the probe. If any abnormality or irregularity issuspected at the level of furtherevaluation is recommended with curvilinear probe orMRI. If abnormalities are seen at the level of proxi-mal P1, evaluation of the DDFT in the distal metacar-pal/metatarsal region and non-weighted views arerecommended to improve visualization in the palmar/plantar fetlock region. There is a vessel located cen-trally between the two lobes of the DDFT that can castas i g n i cant side lobe artifact, usually at the level of P1B. This can be identi ed by the central reproduci- ble location and the tortuous tubular shape (Table 1). Straight Sesamoidean Ligament This structure appears to be less commonly injured than the SDFT, DDFT, and OSLs,3-5but injuries can result in severe lameness. It is located just dorsal to Fig. 19. 1, Probe position over the origin of the lateral OSL. 2, Transverse image of the origin of the lateral OSL. 3, Longitudinal or- igin of the lateral OSL.

Cross-sectionally, the shape of the ligament changes from trapezoidal to square to- ward the P2 insertion.

A central hypoechoic region is almost always present at the longitudinal insertion onto the scutummedium of P2. Contralateral imaging is recom- mended in all cases prior to considering an insertional lesion (Figs. 7 -12). Fig. 13 shows an example of a lesion of the medial lobe of the DDFT.

Superficial Digital Flexor Tendon T h eS D F Ti sc o n s i d e r e dt h et h i r dm o s tc o m m o n l y injured structure in the pastern,3,4after the OSL and DDFT. Injuries occur most commonly in the forelimb. In the proximal pastern, it is a thin cres- cent shape that divides into medial and lateral branches, which insert separately onto distal P1 and the scutum medium of P2. Starting in transverse orientation with the focal zone positioned super - cially, the SDFT is identi ed super cial to the DDFT at the level of P1. The lateral margin is then identi- ed and the probe moved laterally to center the lat- eral branch in the image (Fig. 15). The probe can then be moved directly distally from that location to follow the lateral branch insertion. The branch changes from slightly teardrop in shape to a broad, somewhat inhomogeneous triangle, particularly axi- ally (Fig. 16). With experience, the blending of bers from the axial and abaxial palmar ligaments can beappreciated at the insertion. The probe is rotated to obtain a longitudinal image (Fig. 17). Care must be taken to ensure the probe is located over the SDFT branch itself in the longitudinal view and not a por-tion of another structure. The same technique is repeated for the medial lobe. Depending on confor- mation, it can be dif cult to obtain the longitudinal image of the insertion onto P2. Fig. 18 shows anexample of a large lesion of the lateral branch of the SDFT. Oblique Sesamoidean Ligaments The OSLs are increasingly recognized as a cause of lameness in sport horses, particularly dressage horses and jumpers.3-5They are considered the most com- mon abnormality identi ed in the pastern region, occurring more often in the forelimb of racehorses and in the hindlimbs of jumping and dressage horses.3,4 They can be technically more dif cult to image well as they have a more heterogenous composition of liga- ment, adipose, and vascular tissue, as well as overly- ing vasculature that results in a more naturally inhomogeneous appearance. It is generally easier for the inexperienced operator to scan the lateral OSLa n dt h e nm o v eo nt ot h em e d i a lO S L .T w o approaches can be used to nd the origin of the OSLs. In the rst, the probe is placed in the trans- verse plane on a slightly proximal oblique angle at the base of the sesamoid bone. The ligament should appear as a slightly gumdrop-shaped structure origi- nating from the base of the sesamoid (Fig. 19). The probe is then manipulated to an angle more parallel to the ground and the ligament followed distally on aslight diagonal toward midline, with P1 visible just deep to it. At about mid-P1, the bers of the lateral and medal oblique blend to insert together directlypalmarly; at that point, the probe is directly palmar or a x i a lo nt h ep a s t e r n( F i g s .2 0a n d2 1 ) . T h es a m e technique is used for the longitudinal plane and repeated for the medial oblique. The second method fornding the origin of the oblique is to obtain an image of the corresponding SL branch in the trans-verse plane and follow it to its insertion on the proxi- mal sesamoid bone. The probe then continues distally over the sesamoid and is angled proximally just after crossing the joint. The OSL origin should appear on the opposite side of the joint from the sus- pensory insertion. The ultrasonographer should be aware that the distal 1/3 of the OSL is quite dif cult to identify in the transverse plane and it is also chal-lenging to keep the probe fully in place over the OSL,making this region dif cult to evaluate well on ultrasound. Additionally, the origin of the ligamentcan be somewhat inhomogeneous, and corresponding longitudinal views of this region take practice to obtain accurately. Adequate effort should be made to obtain good corresponding longitudinal images in order to help determine whether hypoechoic regions are due to incidence angle, anatomic variation, or pathology. When suspecting a lesion, care should be t a k e nt oo b t a i ni m a g e si nt w op l a n e s ,t a k em e a s u r e - ments and evaluate the contralateral limb. When comparing measurements, it is important to note that the cross-sectional area of the lateral OSL can be up to 20% larger than the medial OSL normally. Figure 22 shows an example of an acute on chronic lesion OSL. Podotrochlear Apparatus It is possible to evaluate the DDFT, distal recess of t h eD D F T ,N B ,C S L ,a n dp a l m a r / p l a n t a rp o u c ho ft h e DIP joint with a curvilinear or microconvex probe.6If this type of probe is available to the practitioner, developing the skills to evaluate thepodotrochlear region, in particular the DDFT, is recommended. Occasionally, a subtly abnormal DDFT has detectable lesions at the level of distal P2. A normal appearance of the DDFT over P1 does not rule out a lesion distally, especially if the clinical picture is suggestive of an injury to the DDFT. The region is scanned with the foreleg positioned behind the vertical as in a navicular skyline position for radiographs (Fig. 23). In the hindlimb, this region is generally more easily ac- cessible than the forelimb. Longitudinal and transverse images can be obtained. Lesions most commonly present as lobular asymmetry or irreg- ularities of the dorsal margin. Navicular bursa effusion may be present and symmetric or present and asymmetric (Figs. 24 -26).

Introduction With the increased availability and quality of ultra- sound machines for the eld practitioner, evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of pathologic conditions of the mare reproductive and urinary tract has dramati- cally improved. Regarding the use of ultrasound inthe reproductive management of the mare, the most signicant positive impact was in the 1980s, when transrectal ultrasonography facilitated early and ef - cient management of mares with twins.1-3This application has dramatically reduced the number of twins and twin-related reproductive loss in the equinebreeding industry. This document will review someof the basic ultrasonographic characteristics of the mare reproductive and urinary tract as well as the cau- dal abdomen that are accessible by the transrectal andtransabdominal approach. Although a detailed de- scription of ultrasonography of the mare 's reproductive and caudal urinary tract is provided elsewhere, 4-9this document will help by highlighting techniques, land-marks, and measurements that will increase the reper- toire of the practitioner in a eld setting. 2. Methods for Evaluation of the Mare Reproductive Tract and Urogenital Tract This discussion will be limited to structures that can be identi ed and evaluated using a standard mid-to- high frequency rectal linear array transducer (5-7.5M H z )w i t ham a x i m u md e p t ho f1 5c m . F o ram o r edetailed instruction on how to manipulate and optimize settings for ultrasound evaluation, the reader is referred to a more comprehensive review.6,10For some machines, the ultrasound settings are preset,with a minimal ability to alter the settings. In mostcases, the settings for reproductive transrectal ultra-sound that are preset are usually appropriate for most cases to complete the examination described below. This document will review the highlights ofmare reproductive ultrasound in the nonpregnant andpregnant mare, with a brief review on how to evaluatethe urinary tract by using transrectal ultrasonography. Equine veterinarians are usually comfortable with per- forming a transcutaneous ultrasound evaluation on ahorse for the purposes of a colic evaluation as wellas transrectal palpation and ultrasound of the repro-ductive tract evaluation. In the case of a more in- depth transrectal evaluation or evaluation in a compro- mised or fractious animal, it is essential to preparethe patient for what may be a 20-minuteprocedure. Before the evaluation, the mare should berestrained safely in stocks or in a stall door by a han- dler competent and responsive to your requests and the horse 's behavior. Sedation may be required in the case of fractious or frightened horses or those unfami-liar with a transrectal evaluation. In the case oftransrectal evaluation, chemical restraint is tious or anxious animals. Once the horse is compliant NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 31HOW TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF ULTRASOUND IN THE FIELDand restrained, by using adequate lubrication, evacu- ate the rectum fully to the cranial extent one can reach with their ngertips. In horses that may have friable rectal mucosa (diarrhea, colic, and dehydration), 60 mlof sterile lubricant can be infused in the rectum before palpation to facilitate evaluation. In cases in which an infectious disease is suspected (e.g., Salmonella ), the transducer can be placed in a palpation sleeve withlubricant to protect the transducer from becoming a fomite. 3. Ultrasound of the Nonpregnant Mare Transrectal palpation and ultrasound of the reproduc- tive tract include evaluation of the reproductive tract and also allow for evaluation of the caudal urogenital tract and peritoneal cavity. In cases of colic, sus- pected uterine or gastrointestinal (GI) viscera tear or hemorrhage, the transrectal exam can aid in this di- agnosis and even identify the site of compromise. It is helpful during the transrectal evaluation to remem- ber that any structure of interest can and should be viewed with the ultrasound in multiple orientations to better de ne it. For example, if there is a question- able structure identi ed in the cervix, the probe can be rotated from the cranial-caudal orientation to a trans- verse position and the exact location of the structure relative to the lumen can be identi ed. Evaluation of the following should be performed during each rectalexam for reproduction but also in cases of colic, chronic pain, and behavior issues that are often referred for evaluation. With ultrasound machines, there can be a delay in processing the image as one moves over an area of interest with the transducer. If moving too quickly with the machine set to a slower frame rate (less than 80 Hz), the operator will need to be cogni- zant to adjust or slow the movement of the transducer over areas of interest because if movement is too quick, small but signi cant abnormalities may not be identi ed. This is particularly important when eval- uating for twins, and questionable vesicles should alsobe evaluated in multiple plans. 1. Pelvic inlet: Initial palpation should include evaluation for abnormal masses, palpation ofthe caudal aorta for dilations, con rmation of the normal location of GI tract, and sweepingof the pelvis and dorsal aspect of the pelvic inlet to try to identify any abnormal structures. It is also essential to ensure there is normal range of movement of the reproduc- tive tract, bladder, and viscera. In cases of adhesions, they will often be identi ed by the inability to manipulate the structure in a nor-mal fashion. Manipulation of viscera and sweeping the pelvis, under the ovaries and uter- ine horns and bladder, may be the only way to identify an issue. The ultrasound probe can be placed on any abnormal masses and doppler used to evaluate if blood flow is present (e.g., neoplasia). Abnormal masses (hematomas,neoplasia, and calci cation) often disrupt the normal architecture and can be soft to rm and contain variable contents. Only neoplasia or the rare hematoma that encircles a vessel willhave blood flow that can be diagnosed with doppler. Masses may be solid or fluid lled. The presence of free fluid is often deter- mined by the echogenicity (usually hypoechoic,but may contain swirling or flocculent material). Fluid that is dense (purulent ormucoid) may appear to have architecture, butoften when jostled or tapped, the fluid can be seen moving in a swirling fashion relative toorganized tissue. Very hyperechoic flecks may or of-ten appear hyperechoic or isoechoic to the sur-rounding tissue and may be thick (1-3 cm) orthin 1- to 5-mm strands outlined by hypoechoicfluid. 2. Peritoneal fluid: One should always evaluate the ultrasonographic character and amount ofthe peritoneal fluid. Normally the largest measurable amount is small ( <3 cm) anechoic pockets seen ventrolateral to the bladder andin some cases in small pockets around the ova-ries and between viscera. Excessive free ab-dominal fluid (more than 10 cm at either side of the bladder, adjacent to the cervix and cau- dal uterine body) or change in echogenicity(normal is anechoic in appearance) shouldwarrant further investigation (transabdomi-nal ultrasound, bloodwork, or other diagnos-tics). 10-15One can often appreciate gas echos as pinpoint hyperechoic dots that maycoalesce in larger amounts dorsally, obscuringdeep structures. This is useful in the case of ruptured GI viscera or uterus or recent sur- gery and should be searched for in the dorsalregions surrounding the ovaries and neph-rosplenic space. Increased echogenicitymay indicate peritonitis, hemoabdomen, oruroabdomen. 14,15Interestingly, in that havehad previous colic surgery, peritonitis, orcesarean section, one can see hyperechoictags (usually <0 . 5c ma tt h i c k e s tr e g i o n ) attached to serosal surfaces outlined byanechoic fluid. They can often be identi- ed in pockets of fluid as being attached to the serosal surface of the digestive tract. 3. Ovaries: Ultrasound and palpation of the overall struc-tures (follicles and corpora lutea); paraovarian cysts; and a palpable ovulation fossa should be noted. 4,6Moveability of the ovary and response of the mare duringpalpation may also be important in cases ofabnormal behavior. 16 4. Uterus: The uterus should be palpated for position relative to the pelvis (dependentand ventral positioning may inhibit normalHOW TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF ULTRASOUND IN THE FIELD 32 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSuterine clearance), size, and tone. Ultra- sound evaluation of the uterus proceeds fromthe tip of one horn, across the uterine body,and to the tip of the other horn, assessing thefollowing: \u0081Endometrial edema: It is absent in diestrus or anestrus and increases under the in fluence of estrogen or in flammation. Presence of edema should be correlated to ovarian structures to make sure it is appropriate given the stage of theestrous cycle. 4Usually edema is graded from 0 to 4, with 0 being uniform echogenicity of theendometrial folds and 4 being signi cant or with heterogenous \"pin-wheel \" appearance. 6 \u0081Luminal fluid: The location, amount (usually measured in the dorsoventral plane in centi-meters), and character (ranges from anechoic tohyperechoic) are evaluated. Normal uterine fluid is anechoic with only small amounts 1c m in estrus. 17,18Fluid in diestrus is generally considered abnormal and should warrant investigation. Any echogenic fluid, unless recently foaled or mated should also be evaluated as it may represent purulent material, urometra, or other pathologic conditions. Again, intrauter-inefluid should be compared to the ovarian struc- tures to determine if it is appropriate. 18-22Slow, thorough evaluation of the entire uterus is critical to identify foreign bodies, retained endometrial cups, cysts, or areas with signi cant changes in echogenicity of the endometrium. Hyperechoic structures in the uterus can be associated with gas echoes (Fig. 1), scar tissue, mineralized mate- rial (endometrial cups can appear as multifocal pinpoint to 2 cm slightly hyperechoic to mineral-ized structures at the base of the uterine folds), foreign bodies, and urine sediment. In cases in which the uterine lumen requires furtherevaluation (suspected adhesions, cysts, and for- eign bodies), the uterus can be infused with 1 to 3L of sterile lactated Ringer 's solution with a cuffed bivona catheter, and transrectal ultra-sound can be used to help outline the structuresof question. Translumenal adhesions and for-eign bodies will often appear as hyperechoicbands or structures outlined by the lavage fluid and in the uterine lumen. This technique mayhelp differentiate if a structure identi ed on ultrasound is in the uterine lumen or the deeperuterine wall. This technique may also allow forevaluation of patency of the uterine horns. 1. Cervix: Transrectal ultrasonography can help identify anatomic defects that may not be appreciated by palpation. 23,24The inner lin- ear longitudinal bers of the cervix are easily seen surrounding the cervical lumen in thenormal cervix during diestrus. To evaluate the cervix, the transducer is placed in the cra-nial-caudal orientation and directly above the cervix. The transverse image is obtained by rotation 90\u00b0 within the pelvic canal.Disruption of the linear bers, pockets of fluid, cysts, or regions of very different echo- texture with blood flow present, may suggest pathology (muscular defects [Fig. 2], divertic-ula, neoplasia, cysts, or foreign bodies). The gold standard evaluation of cervical compe- tency is digital evaluation during diestrus, 4 but ultrasound evaluation may aid in identify- ing, characterizing, and de ning anatomic relations of the structure of interest.24 2. Vagina: The vagina is important to evaluate during the transrectal ultrasound evaluationprior to any vulvar or vaginal manipulation that would introduce air. In the normalmare, the vagina is collapsed with no air present. It is seen just dorsal to the bladder in the 3- to 5-cm space that is thin and col-lapsed in the normal mare (Fig 2). The cau- dal aspect of the cervix should be evaluated, as pathology can be seen commonly in thisarea. This area should be evaluated for thepresence of fluid (urovagina, vaginitis, cervici- tis, or fluid from the uterus), air (abnormal in large amounts and suggests failure of the vul-var and vestibulovaginal fold barriers), or structures such as hematomas, foreign bodies, or abnormal masses. Accumulations of largeamounts of fluid in the vagina may also sug- gest a persistent hymen or abnormal fluid evacuation. Evaluation of the vaginal wallwith ultrasound is also helpful in the case of rectovaginal stulas (air is often seen traversing the dorsal vaginal wall to the rectum). One can better characterize the extent and location of abscesses, neoplasia, and hematomas. In cases of vaginal tears Fig. 1. Image of gas within the uterine lumen of a mare with pyometra. Note the dorsal location and artifact created by gas.HOW TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF ULTRASOUND IN THE FIELD AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 33due to breeding or foaling, the ultrasound again can be useful for identifying the extentand location of the tear, the presence of hema-toma, and peritoneal fluid quality. 3. Vestibule/Vulva: Ultrasound can be useful in this region to help evaluate tears, abscesses, and hematomas. Air (hyperechoic) is often useful to help outline the path of a traumaticinjury that can be better addressed once oneknows the extent of the lesion. In evaluation of the reproductive tract of the non- pregnant mare, the history, consistency of ndings with stage of the estrous cycle, and behavior must allbe considered to evaluate the animal. Additionaldiagnostics (e.g., uterine biopsy and hysteroscopy) ortreatments are based on the consideration of all these data points. 4. Ultrasonography in the Pregnant Mare The use of ultrasonography in the pregnant mare is important to determine the health of the pregnancy, identify twins for early management (13-16 days post- ovulation), and perform fetal sex determination. In early gestation, ultrasound imaging of the conceptushelps determine normal growth and normal develop-ment through familiarity of the \"normal \"ultrasound appearance of the conceptus and uterus. Using known developmental markers (28-day division of the conceptus with equal compartments of allantoic fluid and yolk sac), it is essential to rule out a nonviablepregnancy (lack of heartbeat or abnormal delayed growth) prior to endometrial cup formation at 35 days postovulation so that termination if necessary can bep e r f o r m e da n dt h em a r ec a nh a v eac h a n c et ob eb r e dback the same season. 4Fetal sexing can also be per- formed from 55 days postovulation onward in preg- nancy, with the most ef cient windows of sex determination at 55 to 75 days and 90 to 150 days.25-28 From 55 to 75 days (optimally 60 days), the location ofthe genital tubercle is used to determine sex, and laterin gestation, the intra-abdominal gonad echotextureand external genitalia or mammary sexing can be performed throughout ges- tation, but the recommended time windows are when the image is most reliably and rapidly obtained. Forthose trying to improve accuracy for sex determination,a stall-side phone app cprovides excellent images for im- mediate comparison. As the fetus and uterus enlargewith advanced gestation, imaging deeper structuresbecomes more ef cient with a transducer of greater penetration (3-5 MHz) that can reach approximately30-cm depth. Most linear transducers range from 5MHz to 15 MHz and cannot penetrate these depths anda different transducer is needed. Despite this, fetalsexing can be performed with the linear rectal trans-ducer by using a transrectal or transabdominalapproach in some cases throughout gestation if the fe- tus is in the correct position. Below are some normal values and key time points that may be helpful whenusing transrectal ultrasonography to monitor a mare' s pregnancy and assess if there is pathology or abnormaldevelopment. Embryonic Vesicle Size T h ee m b r y o n i cv e s i c l es i z e( m e a s u r e m e n to fl a r g e s tdiameter of the vesicle) has been used to help predict if a pregnancy will not be maintained. Undersized vesicles indicated eventual loss in approximately 62%(21/34) of mares, 29-31emphasizing that size is an important parameter in assessing early equine Fig. 2. Two ultrasound images of the mare 's cervix and caudal vagina were captured and superimposed to show the cervix and cra- nial vagina in the top eld. The hyperechoic flecks on the left represent air in the vagina. Below is an image of the cervix with a diverticulum and muscular disruption.HOW TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF ULTRASOUND IN THE FIELD 34 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSpregnancy. Figure 3 can be used as a reference for normal equine vesicle size by day of gestation and reflects the work done by Dr. Ginther.4,6,32,33The position of the embryonic vesicle after 16 days of gestation should be at the base of a uterine horn. Vesicles that spent the majority of time in the uterine body during the mobility phase were associ-ated with increased rates of loss.2In addition to ves- icle size, appropriate early developmental landmarksas the pregnancy develops and the fetal heartbeatbecome visible are reviewed in Figure 4. 33 In midgestation, the fetus and placenta can be eval- uated by transrectal and transabdominal ultrasoundusing the linear transducer. For fetal evaluation inlate gestation, the only limitation of this ultrasound technique is the depth of penetration. A lower fre- quency curvilinear transducer (3-5 MHz) can be usedfor imaging deeper structures, as is usually required for a detailed fetal evaluation. Again, the following discussion is limited to only the 15-cm depth lineartransducer and what can be imaged and achieved with it. In the transrectal evaluation during mid- and late gestation, it is still critical to evaluate the va-gina and cervical region to determine the presence of fluid, air, or any other type of contamination that may be abnormal. Evaluation of the cranial cervicalregion and any fluid accumulation between this and the chorioallantois should be noted. The allantoic and amniotic fluid, the amnion, and often the fetus and fetal orientation can all be evaluated partially during the transrectal exam. Fetal fluids should be assessed for echogenicity and depth. The orientationof the fetus can be determined by locating the orbit ortail by transrectal evaluation or the orientation of therib cage by transcutaneous ultrasound. Fetal heartrate, movement, and tone (are the limbs and neck flac- cid or is there flexion and extension?) can be assessed, as well as character and thickness of the amnioticmembrane. 7,8,10,22,33- 35 Measurements of the combined thickness of the uterus and placenta (CTUP) taken just craniolateralto the cervix have been reported in normal mares andmares with placentitis and can serve, in conjunctionwith other clinical signs, as a way of identifying preg-nancy compromise. 8,36The transrectal measure- ment is taken from the dorsal wall of the largevaginal artery to the allantoic surface just cranial andlateral to the cervix (Fig. 5). Below are the con-densed estimates often used in practice for the upperlimits of normal mare CTUP taken in late gesta-tion. 8,36- 39It is important to evaluate as much of the pregnancy as can be imaged, as the CTUP measure-ment alone does not describe regional pockets of sepa-ration, excessive edema in focal regions, or otherpathology. For transcutaneous ultrasound evalua-tion of the pregnancy, one needs to minimally preparethe mare by removing any dirt or mud from the hair,as this will interfere with the image. Ideally onewould shave the area but this is often not desired byclients. In the eld, it is ef c i e n tt os p r a yt h ea b d o - men with isopropyl alcohol (a one-gallon garden spraybottle works well), from the level of the udder to the xyphoid and approximately 1/3 of the lateral ventral body wall on the side of evaluation. The transduceris placed just lateral to the udder and moved craniallyor in the direction of the hair in a systematic mannerso that all regions where the uterus can be seen areimaged. Reapplying alcohol may help in regionswith poor image quality. One of the most practicalapplications of the transabdominal ultrasound isdetermining if the mare is pregnant. In some situa-tions, farms have moved to a rapid late transabdomi-nal ultrasound pregnancy check that completelyreplaces the transrectal evaluation. To perform this,spray the area just craniolateral to the udder, andusing the linear transducer, look for the presence ofthe fetus and placenta. This can allow for very rapiddetermination of pregnancy in the case of a eld of mares when it is not known which animal abortedor for the purposes of expediency if the farmdesires. Although some information is lost by for-going the rectal palpation (distention of pregnancy,tone, and cervix), other information is gained (echoge-nicity of fetal fluids, fetal movement, and placental thickening). It may be obvious to some but remem-ber that in the late pregnant mare the tissues thatwill be passed from outside to the fetus include skin > Fig. 3. Normal early gestation development and ultrasound ndings.HOW TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF ULTRASOUND IN THE FIELD AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 35body wall > abdominal fat > peritoneal fluid > uterine wall and chorioallantois (often appear as one struc- ture) > allantoic fluid > amniotic membrane (approxi- mately 2 mm thick) > amniotic fluid > and fetus (Fig. 6). With practice, the transabdominal assessment of the pregnancy using a linear transducer can be used and is helpful in the eld setting. It is recommended that the following 3 parameters are evaluated on each transabdominal ultrasound, as together they give a more thorough assessment of the patient health and pregnancy status. 1. Peritoneal fluid: First evaluate the amount of peritoneal fluid (normal is approximately less than approximately 5 cm [author 'se x p e r i e n c e ] ) with viscera lying on the abdominal floor) in depth and its echogenicity (normal is anechoic orhypoechoic relative to a large vessel).7,8,10- 15In a case of a colic in the mare, it is prudent toensure there is not excessive or abnormal peritoneal fluid (hyperechoic or flocculent fluid).14,15Periparturient hemorrhage is always a concern in the late gestation mare, so ruling out hemoabdomen (swirling,moderately echogenic fluid with minimal to no particulate matter) is useful before pro- gressing to a rectal evaluation. This does not guarantee there is not hemorrhage but likely alters the course of treatment. 2. Evaluation of the uterus and chorioallantois: This region in most healthy pregnanciesappears as a relatively uniform echogenicity with a smooth wall on the uterine side and occasional thickenings that represent uterine folds. In some mares, there is a clear de ni- tion between the endometrium and chorionicsurface. In others, it is not as clear and the signicance of this is not known, but the author has seen both in compromised and nor-mal pregnancies. The higher frequency andshallow depth of the linear transducer allow very effective evaluation of the endometrial- chorionic vesicles, large fetal demise, and placental ne- crosis) can be identi ed in this way. There is signi cant folding often associated with Fig. 4. Determining embryonic age by diameter (mm) is depicted. From O. J. Ginther, Ultrasonic Imaging and Animal Reproduction: Horses .32HOW TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF ULTRASOUND IN THE FIELD 36 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSthe nonpregnant horn in normal pregnancy and also at the region of the uterine bifurca-tion that can often be mistaken for \"placen- tal separation.\" To differentiate between freefluid or parenchyma in the uterine-cho- rionic interface, increasing the gain and re-solution helps visualize vessels and the echotexture of organized parenchyma con- sistent with uterine tissue compared to freefluid. Doppler can be used to assess ques- tionable anechoic structures, and movementof the transducer into a different plane willhelp differentiate a tubular vessel from anirregular fluid pocket. One should opti- mize the ultrasound settings and under- stand how to change the doppler settings to identify blood flow in smaller vessels, which appear as anechoic circular structures inthe placenta. 10,36If there is a question of the settings for doppler detection of bloodflow, one can test the same settings on a region of vessels in abdominal muscleparenchyma. If it does not demonstrate blood flow in the abdominal musculature, the settings are inappropriate to assess blood flow in the uterus. 3. Thickness of the CTUP: This has been described for both transrectal (Table 1) andtransabdominal evaluation. 7,8,10,36 -39The transabdominal CTUP measurement is takenfrom the peritoneal surface of the uterus tothe place where the allantoic membranemeets the allantoic fluid (Fig. 6). The maxi- mal uteroplacental thickness was found to be1.3860.23 cm in 33 mares evaluated with normal pregnancies in late gestation toterm. 8Perhaps more important than the measurement is evaluation of excessiveedema in any portion of the placenta (endome-trium, chorion, allantoic oramnion), echogenicity and thick-ness. Edema often appears as heterogeneous echogenicity and areas of hypoechoic tissue (similar to the endometrium in estrus) withoften the parenchyma stretched so that bers, in extreme cases, make linear streaks (Figs. 5and 7). 4. Evaluation of allantoic and amniotic fluid: In a group of 33 normal pregnancies evaluated inlate gestation, the maximal vertical depth ofamniotic fluid (7.9 63.5 cm) was less than allantoic (13.4 64.4 cm) and fewer echogenic particles were detected in amniotic fluid. 38 The allantoic cavity is where hippomanes areformed; these allantoic accumulations can Fig. 5. The image demonstrates measurement of the increased and abnormal CTUP (1.5-2.5 cm) with transrectal ultrasound in a mare at 290 days of gestation that subsequently aborted. The left of the image is caudal and the right is cranial. In this image, there is signi cant edema of the placenta that allows for clear demarcation between the endometrium (which also has edema more clearly seen to the left and above the tab for CTUP), chorion, and allantoic membrane. The CTUP again is measured from the dor- sal aspect of the large vessel imaged to the dorsal aspect of the allantoic membrane.HOW TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF ULTRASOUND IN THE FIELD AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 37appear to a well-organ- ized concentrically structure to 20 length. Signi cantly increased echogenicity and very flocculent fetus,or in flammation and infection. 39-45It is not uncommon on some evaluations for there to beflocculent debris in the allantoic cavity, sur- rounded by relatively anechoic fluid if the mare has just been moving (walked in from eld for evaluation). 5. Fetal evaluation: The ability to predict the outcome of the pregnancy based on biophysi-cal markers diagnosed on ultrasound (fetalmovement, character of fetal fluid, CTUP, fe- tal aortic diameter, and fetal heart rate) hasnot led to a universally accepted, highly reli- able method to predict pregnancy outcome. A study in 2019 demonstrated that the bio-physical pro le that evaluated transabdomi- nal CTUP, fetal heart rate, and fetal aorticdiameter was reasonably sensitive (85.19%),specic (87.25%), and accurate (86.82%) in diagnosing compromised fetuses in 27/129pregnancies. 45This topic has been explored in depth, with recent research sugge-sting fetal carotid ultrasonography may behelpful. 46While investigating the best way to identify pathology in utero, the followingare a few useful pieces of information that canbe obtained with just the linear array rectaltransducer. a. Orientation: Using the ribs and the narrow- ing of the ribs spaces or the location ofthe heart relative to the lungs and liver, the direction of the fetus can be ascertained. After 8 months of gestation, the fetusshould be in anterior presentation and will likely not change orientation as the preg- nancy progresses. 4Because of this, identi- cation of a caudal fetal presentation at 310 days of gestation is helpful to appropriatelyprepare for foaling. b. Fetal movement: By holding the probe still for several minutes, often gross fetalmovement can be con rmed. The fetus goes through normal periods of rest, but ifno fetal movement is appreciated, identi - cation of a fetal heartbeat should beattempted. c. Fetal heart rate: The ribcage is identi ed and followed cranially on the fetus (this usually corresponds to caudally on the mare). The maximum depth setting is useful in this scenario, as it allows one to see the widening and narrowing of the ribspaces (narrower cranially on the fetus). Once the heart is imaged, the practitioner can use either the M-Mode setting, doppler, or 2-D B-mode and count beats per Fig. 6. Image of late gestation pregnancy with transabdominal approach using a linear array rectal transducer. Structures encountered from outside the body wall to the fetus include hair/skin > muscle > intra-abdominal fat > peritoneal serosal lining >peritoneal fluid > perimetrium (serosal lining of uterus) > myometrium endometrium > chorioallantois (chorionic surface connects to endometrium, allantoic membrane is thin and faces the allantoic cavity) > allantoic cavity > amniotic membrane > amniotic cavity > fetus. In this image, the gain is too high, and so what is normally anechoic peritoneal fluid appears to have linear horizontal echo- genic artifacts that traverse all the tissue layers deep to the peritoneal fluid pocket. Table 1. Normal CTUP Measurements of Healthy Pregnancies8 Gestation Length USE OF ULTRASOUND IN THE FIELD 38 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSminute. Although there is signi cant vari- ation in the fetal heart rate, in general, it is more concerning when the heart beat isvery low ( <60 bpm) as compared to an ele- vation in heart rate. Average late gesta-tion fetuses with normal pregnanciesdemonstrated regular cardiac rhythm witha mean heart rate of 75 67 beats/ minute. 38Observing the fetus and re-eval- uating heart rate is ideal, but in some cases,just identifying a heartbeat is the goal. Incases in which the heart cannot be identi-ed, a large umbilical or fetal vessel can be identi ed and evaluated with doppler or magni cation to detect ultrasonographic evidence of blood flow, and a heart rate can be determined. d. Fetus: A thorough fetal exam in utero requires experience and time. For the pur- poses of most practitioners, a few key benchmarks are useful to take a prelimi-nary assessment of the fetus. i. Bladder: The bladder is normally col- lapsed or only slightly distended. Alarge round, anechoic fluidlled struc- ture in the caudal fetal abdomen, not adjacent to the liver is most likely the bladder. This is abnormal if it appears distended, larger than the stomach, or obscured by the abdominalviscera. An enlarged bladder is often a sequelae to an umbilical cord torsion as the pressure elicited by twisting closesthe urachal outlet into the allantoic fluid cavity. 41-45 ii. Umbilical cord: It is often recognized as a linear or coiled structure near the fe-tal abdomen or near the legs or the uterine bifurcation, containing 3 circu-lar anechoic structures in cross-section (2 umbilical arteries, 1 umbilical vein). 41-45For the amniotic portion of the cord (nearest the fetus), the urachus can often be identi ed as an irregularly shaped structure not much larger thanthe diameter of the vessels. Extensive sacculations or dilations with no flow on doppler may signal pathology, and again, excessive sacculations and dis- tention with an enlarged bladder maysuggest umbilical torsion. 41-45 iii. Fetal stomach: The fetal stomach is located right behind the liver as arounded, usually anechoic fluidlled structure. The presence of fluid in the stomach is a normal nding and sug- gests the foal is swallowing amniotic Tract in the Horse by Transrectal Ultrasonography Indications for transrectal ultrasound evaluation of the urinary tract include hematuria, stranguria, or any other indication of pelvic pain or pathology of theurinary system. The urinary tract can be evaluatedwell with the linear array rectal transducer, and in some cases, the parenchyma of the kidney is better visualized with a transrectal approach (Fig. 7). Theurethra, bladder, ureters, and both kidneys can usu-ally all be imaged with patience and practice. Thecranial aspect of both kidneys can be dif cult to image completely, and due to positioning, the right cranial ureter and kidney are more dif cult to image. A smooth muscle relaxant such as N-butylscopolammo- nium bromide dcan be used to facilitate rectal relaxa- tion if the there is too much tension on the rectaltissue during evaluation. Pelvic Urethra In the mare, this is usually identi ed approximately 3 to 12 inches cranial to the anus and extends from thebladder cranially to the ventral aspect of the vestibu- lovaginal fold caudally. The urethra in the mare is usually collapsed and has a slightly echogenic linedemarcating the lumen that runs from the caudalopening to the bladder (caudal to the cervix or just at Fig. 7. Transabdominal ultrasound image obtained with a lin- ear array rectal transducer at 306 days of gestation in a mare with signi cant edema in the chorionic region. The allantoic fluid was considered normal. Note the linear striations in the chorionic region, as edema accumulates in the parenchyma.HOW TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF ULTRASOUND IN THE FIELD AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 39the same level), to beneath the vestibulovaginal fold (often demarcated by air in the vestibule).9 Bladder T h en o r m a lp a l p a t i o no ft h ee q u i n eb l a d d e rs h o u l d not be distended so that it lls the pelvic inlet. Normally, the dorsal bladder wall does not extend above the brim of the pelvis, and if it is painful upon palpation or manipulation, this is abnormal. Often large bladder stones can be pal-pated in an emptied bladder. Ultrasound in the nor-mal animal reveals a smooth bladder wall withuniform echogenicity and slightly wrinkled whencollapsed. 9,11The ultrasonographic can be relatively anechoic to heterogenous swirl-ingfluid with variable sediment in the ventral aspect. Bladder stones appear as smooth toirregular surfaced, hyperechoic structures thatreflect the ultrasound such that tissue deep to the structure cannot be imaged. 11Movement of the bladder can help identify if the pathology isattached to the bladder wall or ureters and help to characterize and estimate size of the structure. Bladder rupture can have a variable appearancewith collapsed bladder and increased free fluid in the abdomen. 9,11,15The continuity of the bladder wall is evaluated, and if there is no freefluid and the bladder is distended, rupture is unlikely. Ureters Ureteral trauma is rare and likely underdiagnosed, as it is not an area that is commonly evaluated. The easiest way to identify and evaluate the ureters is toidentify the bladder and then place the transducer intransverse orientation, moved caudally to the regionof the bladder neck and beginning of the pelvic ure-thra (Fig. 8). On the dorsal aspect of the bladder, theureters will be small ( <5 mm in diameter, wall thick- ness of <2 mm in the normal adult). 9,47- 49The ure- teral opening will appear as an irregular surface onthe luminal surface of the bladder wall at approxi-mately the 10 and 2 o 'clock position. If one waits, as urine is emptied into the bladder, the ureters will distend and swirling fluid can be seen entering the bladder. The ureters can be followed crani- ally, sometimes all the way to the entrance to therenal pelvis. Once identi ed caudally, the trans- ducer is manipulated to keep the ureter in crosssection and is followed cranially. Intermittentlling with urine will help con rm their presence if one is unsure. Excessive dilation and hypere-choic contents that obscure the lumen warrantinvestigation of the kidney, and ureteral urineflow should be assessed (Fig. 8). Kidneys The kidney parenchyma can be evaluated well with the transrectal approach (Fig. 9). The limitation is that often the cranial aspect cannot be reachedand imaged, and occasionally the right kidney isso far cranially that it is not easy to even image the caudal aspect. Renoliths, calci cation within the kidney, and excessive dilation ortrauma to the kidney have all been imaged with this transrectal approach. 14,46 T h em o r eo n eu s e st h eu l t r a s o u n dt oe v a l u a t et h e i r patients, the more familiar one becomes with what is normal. This is essential in later being able to differ- entiate normal from abnormal and help with early di- agnosis of conditions that may have been missed without ultrasonic evaluation. The reader is encour- aged to practice new ways of using their ultrasound equipment, as it will enhance the quality of care of the patients. Fig. 8.

Introduction Suspensory ligament injury is an important source of lameness or poor performance in athletichorses.1-4Injury to the suspensory ligament can affect the ligament and third metatarsalbone.1Ultrasonography is commonly used to evaluate the suspensory ligament and may be a reasonably accurate predictor of suspensory liga- ment pathology.2An accurate diagnosis of proxi- mal suspensory desmopathy is of great im-portance as recommended options for manage-ment can be expensive and lengthy. 3Regions of fat and muscle create variations in the suspensoryligament 's echogenicity.1This echo pattern makes it dif cult to determine if these variations in echogenicity are the result of injury or normalsuspensory ligament anatomy.1In order to iden- tify regions of suspensory ligament bers versus areas of fat and muscle, off-angle or oblique-inci-dence imaging should be performed. When usingoff-angle imaging, the position of the probe ischanged such that the ultrasound beam is no lon-ger perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of thesuspensory ligament bers. This change in theposition of the probe, and the resulting change in the echogenicity of suspensory ligament bers and that of the regions of fat and muscle, can be usedto identify the regions of different tissue typeswithin the ligament. 1When the ultrasound beam is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of linear bers within a normal tendon or ligament, maximum echogenicity is created.1When the ultrasound beam is not perpendicular to a normaltendon or ligament, decreased echogenicity can be created in that structure.1The echogenicity of fat, and to a lesser degree, muscle, is not depend-ent on the ultrasound beam angle.1However, the difference between the echogenicity of fat and muscle cannot be readily identi ed in the suspen- sory ligament.5Therefore, comparing the ap- pearance of the suspensory ligament with thebeam both perpendicular (on angle) and not per-pendicular (off angle) to the ligament allows iden-tication of bers versus regions of fat and muscle. 5Regions of mottling or decreased echo- genicity identi ed in the suspensory ligament with ultrasound can then be further investigatedusing changes in beam angle to determine if thesource of these regions is ligament bers or fat NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 43HOW TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF ULTRASOUND IN THE FIELDand muscle.1This paper describes the ultrasono- graphic method of evaluating the equine proximal hind suspensory ligament using the plantar non- weight-bearing approach using on- and off-angle imaging as compared to the standard method. 2. Materials and Methods Patient Preparation and Positioning The hair should be clipped on the plantar aspect of the metatarsal region beginning just proximal to thechestnut. Beginning at the level of the chestnut, theskin should be clipped over the plantar and plantarome-dial aspects of the metatarsus extending distally to thelevel of the suspensory ligament bifurcation. Followingclipping, the skin should be cleansed and coupling gelliberally applied. 6When evaluating the hind suspen- sory ligament with ultrasound, the authors typicallyperform the plantaromedial approach rst with the limb in a weight-bearing position, followed by the plan-tar non-weight-bearing approach. The plantaromedialweight-bearing approach is not described in thispaper. For the plantar non-weight-bearing approach,the limb may be positioned in one of the following man-ners depending on the operator 's preference: (1) resting on the toe or (2) pulled forward with the foot resting onthe operator 's knees; (3) the foot may be propped on a farrier stand, or (4) the foot may be held in a non-weight-bearing position by an assistant (Fig. 1). Thiscreates laxity in the flexor tendons, resulting in awidening of the skin surface for increased probe contact,and decreases the distance between the ultrasoundprobe and the suspensory ligament, allowing adjust- ments in the ultrasound machine settings for a more detailed evaluation of the ligament. Ultrasound Probe and Settings High-frequency (7.5-16 MHz) linear array ultrasound probes are preferred for this examination.1,4,6The fre- quency, focal zones, depth, and gain should beadjusted to maximize image quality at the level of the suspensory ligament. For an average-size Warmblood or Thoroughbred horse, a 4-cm depth set- ting and a frequency of 10 MHz are reasonable initialmachine settings that can then be adjusted based on the individual patient. Although all structures at this level should be assessed during the ultrasound examination, the minimum depth should be selected that places the hyperechoic line representing theplantar third metatarsal bone margin clearly in the fareld of the image. 1 Ultrasound Examination First, the horse should be appropriately restrained and the limb positioned as described above, according to the operator 's preference. The ultrasound probe is placed in a transverse position on the plantar aspectof the limb, immediately distal to the tarsometatarsal joint at the level of the suspensory ligament attach-ment on the third metatarsal bone. The entirety of the proximal suspensory ligament is evaluated prior to evaluating the proximal branch of the suspensory ligament. This structure is also referred to as the accessory ligament or the proximal bundle in the literature. When the limb is in a non-weight-bearing position, manipulating the flexor tendons allows for t h eu l t r a s o u n db e a mt ob eo r i e n t e da sd o r s a l l ya sp o s - sible while still visualizing the entire ligament. This is achieved by placing the probe surface parallel to the plantar third metatarsal bone margin. The initial image created should allow visualization of the axialsurfaces of the second and fourth metatarsal bones with the plantar margin of the third metatarsal bone oriented in a horizontal position. Once the initial image is obtained, the ultrasound machine settings should be adjusted from baseline to ensure the correctdepth, frequency, gain, and focal zones. The time gain compensation settings should be used to create uniform echogenicity in the image, which typically requires increasing the gain in the image far eld. Normal suspensory ligament bers will be echogenic when the ultrasound beam is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the bers and will become hypoechogenic when the probe position is changedsuch that the beam is no longer perpendicular to the bers. Regions of fat and muscle will remain echo- genic regardless of beam angle. Both on- and off- angle images are obtained during this examination, and corresponding longitudinal images can be obtained. Off-angle images of the ligament in its en- tirety should be obtained rst, which allows Fig. 1. Image of the authors 'preferred position of the limb rest- ing on the toe to perform the plantar non-weight-bearing ultra- sound evaluation.HOW TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF ULTRASOUND IN THE FIELD 44 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSidenti cation of anatomic features of the ligament s u c ha ss i z e ,s h a p e ,a n dm a r g i n sa sw e l la st h ef a t and muscle distribution, which correlates to gross andMRI ndings (Fig. 2). Off-angle images are obtained by raising or lowering the probe cable at the site of skin contact. The probe position should be changed the minimum amount that decreases the echogenicityof the ligament bers. This has been reported as approximately 10\u00b0. 6These images should be saved and compared to the on-angle images in order to iden- tify and characterize pathologic change. In order to ensure that the on- and off-angle images are obtainedat the same level, minor movements in probe positionare necessary. Lowering the probe cable to create an off-angle image will require distal movement of the p r o b et om a t c ht h eo n - a n g l ei m a g ea tt h es a m elevel. Anatomic landmarks, such as the shape of theosseous margins, are used to ensure the off- and on-angle images are made at the same level. Setting the ultrasound machine to a split screen and obtain- ing off-angle images and on-angle images at the samelevel will assist with making these comparisons. Ameasurement system (zones or centimeters) should beconsistently used. The entire suspensory ligament from the proximal branch continuing to the distal extent of the body should be evaluated in transverseand longitudinal planes with images obtained at regu-lar measurement intervals. The size, shape, margins,and peri-ligamentous tissues are best evaluated on off- angle images. Both on- and off-angle images shouldbe evaluated for differences in echogenicity. When learning this technique, the proximal branch is most easily identi ed by placing the probe at the level of the suspensory ligament attachment on thethird metatarsal bone and then following the bers proximally to the fourth tarsal bone. Comparison images of the opposite limb are imperative in all cases. The size and shape of the fourth metatar- sal bone and its relationship to the third metatar- sal bone can be used to ensure comparisonsbetween the right and left hindlimbs are being made at the same level. 1 3. Results Since 2008, approximately 2000 horses have had ultrasound examination of the hind proximal suspen- sory ligament incorporating the plantar non-weight- bearing approach. The suspensory ligament anat-omy has been well identi ed using this technique. In addition, suspensory ligament enlargement, ber abnormalities, and alterations in the fat and mus- cle bundles have been diagnosed using this technique. Beginning the examination immediatelydistal to the tarsometatarsal joint, the suspensory lig- ament consists of a narrow, rectangular-to-square band of ligamentous bers attached to the plantar surface of the third metatarsal bone. The bers are more prominent lateral of midline (Fig. 3). 4The sus- pensory ligament has a relatively homogenous Fig. 2. This is a comparison of the proximal suspensory ligament at the same level.

Distal to the third metatarsal bone attach- ment, there may be a partial sagittal cleft dorsally,giving the ligament a heart-shaped appearance thattransitions more distally (Fig. 5). 4However, this sagittal cleft is not present in all horses, and inthe absence of a sagittal cleft, the ligament is oval dis-tal to the third metatarsal bone attachment (Fig.6). As the suspensory ligament continues distallyfrom the third metatarsal bone attachment, there istypically a prominent central area of bers (central ber bundle) as well as peripheral bers with regions of fat and muscle that become more prominent. 1In o f f - a n g l ei m a g e sd i s t a lt ot h et h i r dm e t a t a r s a lb o n eattachment, the suspensory ligament appears sepa-rated third metatarsal bone plantar mar-gin by hyperechogenic connective tissue and vessels. 7 This is how the distal extent of the third metatarsalbone attachment can be identi ed. Beginning at this level and continuing distally to the level of the suspen-sory ligament bifurcation, there are fat and musclebundles located within the lateral and medial ber bundles of the suspensory ligament. 1,4The lateral ber bundle is slightly larger than the medial ber bundle.1,4These medial and lateral ber bundles are triangular to oblong in shape, oriented in a dorsoplan-tar direction. 4However, random areas of fat and muscle can dissect through the peripheral ligamentmargin and can become zigzag in shape in the liga-ment body. Asymmetry of the fat and muscle pat-tern can exist between limbs, and these regionsshould not be mistaken for injury. The suspensoryligament has a larger amount of connective tissue sep-arating it from the second metatarsal bone when com- pared to the distance between the fourth metatarsal bone axial margin and the lateral aspect of theligament. 1A linear region of fascial tissue is some- times identi ed plantar to the suspensory ligament, running between the plantar margins of the second Fig. 4.

D, Distal to the third metatarsal bone attachment, notice the partial sagittal cleft dorsally, giving the suspensory ligament a heart-shaped appearance (arrow). There is connective tissue dorsal (light gray region) to the suspensory ligament that will be echogenic regardless of beamangle, and this can be used to identify the distal extent of the attachment on transverse off-angle images.

The off-angle ultrasound image (C) can be used to identify the peripheral ligament margin and the regions of fat and muscle (arrows).

Discussion This technique has been incorporated into all hind- limb proximal suspensory ligament ultrasound evalu- ations since 2008. It provides a method fordetermining the different tissue types within the sus-pensory ligament, which allows the identi cation of normal anatomic characteristics versus pathologicchange. The echogenicity the connective tissuesurrounding the suspensory ligament is not beam-angle dependent, remaining echogenic regardless ofbeam angle. This is the reason that off-angle imagesare most effective at de ning the ligament margins, differentiating them from the surrounding echogenicconnective tissue. 7Additionally, the limb positioning and resulting displacement of the plantar soft tissuesand vasculature reduces edge artifacts, which can obscure the suspensory ligament.7This technique, which can be performed in the eld, provides images that are similar in appearance to MRI images and gross pathology of the suspensory ligament, re flectingt h et r u ea n a t o m i cf e a t u r e so ft h el i g a m e n t( F i g . 2). Utilizing the described technique places the ultra-sound beam perpendicular to the bone-ligament inter-face, aiding in the identi cation of abnormalities at the suspensory ligament attachment on the third metatar-sal bone. The dorsal aspect of the ligament and thecentral ber bundle are commonly affected regions, and this technique improves visualization of these speci c regions. Limitations to this technique include patientcompliance with positioning. However, this is a con-sistent nding with any ultrasound evaluation and can be assisted with proper restraint and/or sedation. Anadditional limitation is that an in-depth knowledge ofthe suspensory ligament anatomic features isrequired in order to effectively utilize the tech-nique. This technique may be considered by some tobe challenging; however, with practice and knowl-edge of normal anatomic features, it can bemastered. Due to normal anatomic variations, thereis the potential for asymmetry of the ber and fat/ muscle distribution when comparing oppositelimbs. However, the opposite limb still provides ahelpful guide for determining the anatomic features ofthe ligament. In addition, ber disruption and/or moderate ber abnormalities are both decreased in echogenicity to anechoic regardless of beam angle, dis- tinguishing them from normal ligament bers or other tissue types. A thorough clinical evaluation should be performed prior to ultrasonographic Fig. 6.

This technique should be incorporated into the standard suspensory liga- ment ultrasound examination in conjunction with the plantaromedial approach. Subtle changes in shapeas a result of ligament injury are often visible beforeber abnormalities are detected. Therefore, a com- parison with the opposite limb is imperative to identifythese subtle ligament shape changes. In conclusion, athorough understanding of the normal anatomy in con-junction with a complete examination as described inthis manuscript and comparison to the opposite limbwill provide the most clinically relevant information inregard to the condition of the suspensory ligament.

Alterations in the fat and muscle distribution on ultrasound images are an important and sometimes the only indication of pathologic change. Author 's address: Equine Diagnostic is a common source of lameness in performance horses.1-5 Diagnosis of lameness localized to the proximal meta-carpal or metatarsal region is typically achieved byphysical examination, diagnostic analgesia, and imag-ing. 3,6-9Radiographs can be used to identify changes in bone density at the attachment of the suspensoryligament on the third metacarpal or metatarsalbone. Increased density resulting from sclerosis and/or decreased density resulting from lysis or resorptionare radiographically identi able abnormalities that can be associated with suspensory ligament injury.Ultrasound is typically used to evaluate the suspen-sory ligament prior to advanced imaging when lame-ness is localized to the proximal metacarpal andmetatarsal regions. Ultrasound of the proximal sus-pensory ligament requires a thorough knowledge ofanatomy and the normal anatomic variations of thesuspensory ligament when comparing different horses as well as different limbs of the same horse. A com- plete ultrasound examination of the suspensory liga- ment has evolved over the last several years. New ultrasound methods have been developed that allow a more precise and complete evaluation of the complexsuspensory ligament anatomy than can be accom-plished using the standard on-angle weight-bearing technique. On- and off-angle non-weight-bearing ultrasound imaging is now considered an invaluablecomponent of the complete proximal suspensory liga-ment ultrasound examination, and the advantages ofthis technique have been well established. This tech-nique allows a complete evaluation of the suspensoryligament with identi cation of the different tissue types within the suspensory ligament. Identi cation of the complete suspensory ligament and the normal NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 49HOW TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF ULTRASOUND IN THE FIELDanatomy is an important component and the rst step in the diagnosis of pathologic change.10 There are a wide range of abnormalities that can affect the proximal suspensory ligament and the third metacarpal or metatarsal bone attachment resultingin lameness. Advanced imaging, such as magneticresonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography(CT), has been used for the diagnosis of pathologicchange in the proximal suspensory ligament and ismore effective than ultrasound for diagnosing certaincomponents of injury in this region. MRI, CT, andultrasound identify different types of pathologicchange affecting the proximal suspensory ligamentand its osseous attachment. MRI excels at soft tis-sue detail and has been a tremendous educational toolby clearly demonstrating the normal anatomic fea-tures and variations of the suspensory ligament aswell as the different types of pathologic change. CTdemonstrates bone detail and vascular patternswithin injury, and the use of contrast increases theconspicuity of associated soft tissue injury. Advancedimaging is necessary to identify certain types of sus- pensory ligament injury, and this is typically depend- ent on the nature and severity of the injury. However,there are speci c patterns of pathologic change that in the past were not diagnosed with ultrasound ini-tially but were identi ed using MRI and then retro- spectively identi ed with ultrasound. Eventually, with practice and experience, certain types of patho-logic change can be more easily identi ed prospec- tively with ultrasound when the speci c patterns of injury are better understood. One speci c pattern of pathologic change in the suspensory ligament that isevident on MRI and can be identi ed well with ultra- sound involves alterations and/or abnormalities inthe fat and muscle distribution. In certain cases,these alterations and/or abnormalities in the fat andmuscle distribution of the suspensory ligament can bethe most evident abnormality on an ultrasoundexamination. Abnormalities affecting the fat andmuscle of the suspensory ligament are typicallyaccompanied by ber abnormalities and often focal or diffuse suspensory ligament enlargement. A widerange of ber abnormalities can be present in the sus- pensory ligament, with various degrees of clinicalrelevance. Some clinically relevant ber abnormal- ities do not produce a detectable change in the echopattern of the ligament bers when examined with ultrasound. In these cases, abnormalities of the fatand muscle and ligament enlargement can be themost evident change identi ed with ultrasound. This paper will review the techniques for identifying abnor-malities in the fat and muscle distribution of the prox-imal suspensory ligament as an indication ofpathologic change using the on- and off-angle non-weight-bearing ultrasound examination. 2. Methods The palmar or plantar non-weight-bearing approach using on- and off-angle ultrasound imaging withcomparison to the opposite limb is recommended forspecic evaluation of the fat and muscle distribution in the suspensory ligament. Although evaluation ofthe fat and muscle in the suspensory ligament can bedone using on- and off-angle imaging with the limb ina weight-bearing position, placing the limb in a non-weight-bearing position for this examination will yieldadditional information that will aid in the diagnosis ofinjury. Assessment of the fat and muscle is not nec-essary for the proximal suspensory ligament branchin the hind limb, as it does not contain fat andmuscle. However, on- and off-angle imaging will stillprovide additional information about the proximalbranch of the suspensory ligament, which is best iden-tied with the limb in a non-weight-bearing position. In both the front and hind limbs, the non-weight-bearing off-angle technique is rst used to identify the entire peripheral margin of the suspen-sory ligament, which is achieved when the second,third and fourth metacarpal or metatarsal bones are identi ed (Fig. 1). This initial assessment of the sus- pensory ligament should be made with the third metacarpal or metatarsal bone visible as a horizontalechogenic line at the distal extent or far eld of the image. The orientation of this line is extremely im-portant as the horizontal positioning of the thirdmetacarpal or metatarsal bone ensures that the ultra-sound beam is interacting with the bers at the same angle allowing comparison of the echogenicity withindifferent portions of the ligament. Although the hor-izontal position of the third metacarpal or metatarsalbone is considered imperative for the initial images,there are reasons to change this osseous margin orien-tation when speci cally evaluating features the metacarpal andmetatarsal regions, such as the interosseous spaces oraxial surfaces of the splint bones and their relation-ship with the suspensory ligament margins (Fig. 2). On the initial image, once the correct positioning of the suspensory ligament is achieved in the off-angleultrasound image, the normal anatomic features ofthe ligament should be identi ed and evaluated. This includes the ligament margins, boundaries of themedial and lateral lobes in the forelimb or ber bun- dles in the hind as well as the regions of ligamentbers versus fat and muscle. The purpose of this assessment is to determine if the pattern of ligamentbers and the fat and muscle distribution represent normal anatomic variation or pathologic change. Thisprocess consists of two steps. The rst is to compare the anatomic characteristics of the ligament to the op-p o s i t el i m b . T h es e c o n di st oe v a l u a t et h eu l t r a s o n o -graphic appearance of the ligament considering thepatterns of normal anatomic variation that existwithin the different limbs of the same horse(Fig. 3). If pathologic change is present in the liga-ment, comparison of the on- and off-angle images are used to determine the nature of the pathologic change. The opposite leg can be used as a guide ford e t e r m i n i n gt h es i z e ,s h a p e ,m a r g i n s ,a n do v e r a l lpattern of ligament bers versus fat and muscleHOW TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF ULTRASOUND IN THE FIELD 50 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSwithin the suspensory ligament on the off-angle images. Certainly, horses can be bilaterally affected. However, comparison to the oppositelimb remains the most useful method for attempt-ing to determine the normal characteristics of thesuspensory ligament for a speci cp a t i e n t . F o r the purposes of this paper, the comparison leg willbe referred to as if it does not have pathologicchange in the suspensory ligament, which the author acknowledges may not be the case in allpatients. When comparing to the opposite limb,the medial and lateral aspects of the suspensoryligament should be compared at the same leveland region, with great care taken to ensure thelevels match. Due to the marked changes thatoccur in the size, shape, margins, and tissue dis-tribution of the ligament, minor differences in thelevel of the ligament when comparing limbs couldproduce marked asymmetry as a result of posi-tioning, which should not be mistaken for patho-logic change. Osseous landmarks provide themost reliable method of ensuring comparisonimages are made at the same level. Pathologicchange within the suspensory ligament can alterall the normal anatomic features. Alterations int h ea p p e a r a n c eo ft h el o b es i z ea n ds h a p e ,a l t e r a -tions in the distribution of the fat and muscle, aswell as an abnormal echo pattern can be identi ed with suspensory ligament injury. For the pur-poses of this paper, the fat and muscle will be con-sidered to have a similar echogenicity and similarresponse to changes in beam angle, such that theycannot be distinguished from each other but canclearly be distinguished from ligament bers. They will be considered a single tissue type for thepurposes of this technique. Off-angle images ofthe affected limb should be evaluated with speci c assessment of the relationship between the Fig. 1. Transverse off-angle non-weight-bearing ultrasound images of front (A) and hind limb (B) suspensory ligaments. On the corresponding images (A ',B') the peripheral margin of the suspensory ligaments is delineated by the white line and the regions of fat and muscle are shaded with a dashed border. These images are representative of the initial images that should be produced andused to evaluate the fat and muscle within the suspensory ligament. The third metacarpal and metatarsal bones are horizontal echogenic lines in the distal extent or far eld of the image. Due to the shape of the third metacarpal and metatarsal bones there is some curvature to the echogenic line. Fig. 2. In this transverse, non-weight-bearing off-angle ultra-sound image, the third metacarpal bone is angled as opposed to being a horizontal echogenic line as it is in Figure 1. This probeposition and resulting beam angle are used to evaluate the medial interosseous space and axial margin of the second meta- carpal bone. However, the ultrasound beam will interact with the suspensory ligament bers at different angles which will impact the ligament echogenicity.HOW TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF ULTRASOUND IN THE FIELD AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 51suspensory ligament bers and the fat and muscle throughout the length of the ligament. This assessment should include the echogenicity of thebers versus the fat and muscle, the clarity of the interface between the bers and the regions of fat and muscle, as well as the position and the size ofthe fat and muscle. Several different abnormal-ities can occur in the relationship between the bers and the fat and muscle when pathologic change occurs in the suspensory ligament. Theclarity of the interface between the bers and the regions of fat and muscle can decrease, the fat and muscle can be decreased in size or obliterated, andthe regions of fat and muscle are often displacedas a result of enlargement of the bers (Figs. 4, 5). The clarity of the interface between the bers and the fat and muscle is the most dif cult feature to evaluate and must be assessed in light of the overall quality of the images. There is variation in the quality of the images when comparing Fig. 3. Non-weight-bearing off-angle transverse images from 2 different cases with medial suspensory ligament lobe abnormalities and comparison to the medial lobe of the opposite limb. Case A does not have compression of the fat and muscle, while fat and mus- cle compression is present in Case B. The images are centered over the medial lobe of the suspensory ligament, the lateral lobe isnot visible in its entirety. The position and shape of the third metacarpal bone is used to ensure the comparison of the right and left limbs was performed at the same level. Case A has diffuse, moderate medial lobe enlargement in the left fore without obvious palmar displacement of the fat and muscle. The dorsal to palmar dimension of the medial lobes is designated by the arrows on A. The dorsal margin of the left fore medial lobe is contacting the palmar margin of the third metacarpal bone, while in the right fore this space is occupied by connective tissue (space between the arrowheads). Case B has diffuse, moderate medial lobe enlargementin the right fore with palmar displacement and compression of the fat and muscle, which can be identi ed by comparison of the fat and muscle position and size in the left fore (space between the arrowheads). The dorsal aspect of the right fore medial lobe is mod-erately enlarged, affecting the ligament bers. This can be identi ed by comparing the dorsal to palmar dimension of the medial lobe ligament bers (space between arrows) in the right and left fore images. Case B has resorption of the third metacarpal bone at the suspensory ligament medial lobe attachment giving it a convex margin as compared to the left fore which has a flat, but angled margin (white outlines). The resorption causes the third metacarpal bone sagittal crest to appear more prominent and sharply mar- ginated (asterisk). However, this is a result of bone loss at the medial lobe attachment, not proliferation of the sagittal crest.HOW TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF ULTRASOUND IN THE FIELD 52 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSdifferent horses affecting the amount of difference in the echogenicity of the ligament bers versus the regions of fat and muscle, which directly impacts the clarity of the interface. Once abnor- malities are identi ed within the suspensory liga- m e n to nt h eo f f - a n g l ei m a g e s ,t h e s es p e c i c regions are then evaluated on the on-angle imagesto determine if there is abnormal echogenicity within the regions corresponding to ligament bers that would indicate ber abnormalities are present. 3. Results Using on- and off-angle non-weight-bearing ultra- sound examination, generalized suspensory ligament enlargement or speci c regions of enlargement can be detected. Furthermore, alterations in the echogenic-ity of the bers as well as alterations in the margins, size, shape, and position of the fat and muscle bundles c a na l s ob ei d e n t i ed. The severity of the abnormal- ities identi ed affecting the ligament bers as well as the fat and muscle bundles can be used to assess the degree of pathologic change in the suspensoryligament. Enlargement or an abnormal shape can be identi ed by rounding of speci c ligament margins or the entire ligament. Normal fore and hind limbsuspensory ligaments have a speci cc h a r a c t e r i s t i c size and shape. The fore limbs have a medial lobethat is longer in its medial to lateral dimension whencompared to its dorsal to palmar dimension. In con-trast, the lateral lobe in the fore limb is typicallymarkedly shorter in its medial to lateral dimension and mildly longer in its dorsal to palmar dimension when compared to the medial lobe. The hind limbsuspensory ligament goes through many characteris-tic shape changes beginning at the third metatarsalbone attachment and continuing into the suspensoryligament body. In the hind limbs, generalized sus-pensory ligament enlargement causes the ligament toappear rounded at a level where it should be triangu-lar or oval (Fig. 4). In the fore limbs, the normal pal-mar margin of the suspensory appears flat and will become rounded with enlargement that can typicallybe attributed to a speci c lobe, unless both lobes are affected. Suspensory ligament enlargement impactsthe relationship between the ligament margins andthe surrounding connective tissue and subsequently Fig. 4. Corresponding MRI and non-weight-bearing on- and o ff-angle images of right and left hind proximal suspensory liga- ments in a case with right hind lameness localized to this region. The off-angle image of the right hind is duplicated so that the borders of the fat and muscle can be delineated (dashed outlines) and then compared to the unmarked image. The right hind suspensory ligament is enlarged and abnormally shaped based on the off-angle comparison images of the right and left hind. The left hind maintains a triangular plantar margin while the right hind has a rounded, wide plantar margin (white outlines). However, the most notable abnormality on the ultrasound images is the shape of the lateral fat and muscle bundle(arrows) when comparing the limbs. It is comma shaped in the right hind because it is medially displaced and compressed. There are extensive ber abnormalities on the MRI image (arrowhead) in the lateral aspect of the suspensory lig- ament that do not produce a detectable change in the echo pattern of the suspensory ligament on the ultrasoundimages. These ber abnormalities were only present on the proton density MRI images and not on the T2 fast spin echo or pro- ton density fat suppressed images, which correlates with the lack of ultrasound visibility. The greatest indication of pathologic change on the ultrasound images is the alteration of the fat and muscle size and position, because the ber abnormalities were not detectable with ultrasound. The white outlines denote the shape of the suspensory ligament margins have been movedplantar to allow visualization of the ligament margins.HOW TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF ULTRASOUND IN THE FIELD AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 53the splint bones. Enlargement affecting the medial or lateral aspects of the suspensory ligament will com- press the surrounding connective tissue, decreasing the distance between the ligament margins and theaxial surfaces of the splint bones. Dorsal ligamentenlargement will compress or obliterate the connec-tive tissue along the dorsal ligament margin. This will change the thickness of the dorsal connective tis- sue or the level at which the connective tissuebecomes visible dorsal to the ligament when comparedto the opposite limb (Fig. 3). The most effective wayto identify enlargement of the suspensory ligament immediately distal to the third metatarsal bone attachment is to create images of both limbs at thesame level using the fourth metatarsal bone shapeand size as a level marker, and then compare the dor- sal connective tissue thickness. The affected limb will have reduced dorsal connective tissue or no dorsalconnective tissue at the level where the comparisonleg has dorsal connective tissue. Once a region ofenlargement is identi ed, close evaluation of the tis- sues in this region should then be performed becausealterations in the fat and muscle bundles oftenaccompany focal or diffuse suspensory ligamentenlargement. The size, shape, and position of the fatand muscle bundles should be evaluated compared to the opposite limb. With enlargement of the dorsal suspensory ligament bers, which seems the most fre- quently affected area, there will be palmar or plantardisplacement of the fat and muscle bundles. Centralber bundle enlargement occurs frequently in the hind suspensory ligament resulting in the peripheraldisplacement of the fat and muscle. Palmar or plan-tarber enlargement does occur and can result in dor- sal fat and muscle displacement but is the leastfrequently encountered displacement of the fat and muscle (Fig. 6). One characteristic of pathologic change in the suspensory ligament that is evident onMRI and can be well identi ed with ultrasound is dis- placement, decreased size or obliteration of the fat and muscle bundles. In certain cases, alterations in t h ef a ta n dm u s c l ec a nb et h em o s te v i d e n to ro n l yultrasound nding in horses with lameness resulting from suspensory ligament injury. Decreased margin clarity between the fat and muscle bundles and liga- ment bers can be detected but is more technic- ally challenging and requires high quality ultra- sound images. Abnormalities in the fat and muscle Fig. 5. Corresponding MRI and non-weight-bearing on- and off-angle images of right and left hind proximal suspensory ligaments. The dorsal margin of each suspensory ligament is denoted by an asterisk on the off-angle images. The left hind sus- pensory ligament is enlarged and abnormally shaped based on the off-angle comparison images of the right and left hind. It has marked dorsal enlargement with focal moderate ber abnormalities (arrows) in the dorsal extent of the enlargement that can be best identi ed in the on-angle ultrasound image. The ber abnormalities in the dorsal aspect of the suspensory ligament produce a detectable change in the echo pattern of the suspensory ligament because of their severity. These ber abnormalities can be identi ed on the proton density images with and without fat suppression. The severity of the ber abnormalities causes them to b ev i s i b l eo nu l t r a s o u n di nc o n t r a s tt ot h e ber abnormalities in Figure 4. In addition to the ber abnormalities, alteration in the fat and muscle can be identi ed in the left hind. The fat and muscle bundles are plantarly displaced and the lateral bundle has a poorly de ned interface with the ligament bers. The marked dorsal enlargement of the left hind suspensory ligament is displac- ing the normal dorsal vasculature. However, this is not the case in the right hind, and the vessel (arrowhead) should not be mis- taken for a lesion. It is outside the ligament margins on the off-angle image and its pathway can be followed or tracked in real time imaging.HOW TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF ULTRASOUND IN THE FIELD 54 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSFig. 6.

The region is less commonly affected than the dorsal aspect of theligament. However, abnormalities can occur in this region. The white outlines denoting the shape of the suspensory ligament margins have been moved plantar to allow visualization of the ligament margins.HOW TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF ULTRASOUND IN THE FIELD AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 55distribution and associated regions of ber enlarge- ment are noted, and these regions are then speci - cally evaluated on the on-angle images. Within the dened regions of ligament bers identi ed on the off- angle images, there should be a normal, uniform echo-g e n i cp a t t e r no nt h eo n - a n g l ei m a g e si fn od e t e c t a b l e ber abnormalities are present. Areas of ligament bers that have decreased echogenicity regardless of beam angle, on both on- and off-angle images,should be interpreted as abnormal. The severity of the ber abnormalities is proportional to the decrease in echogenicity as compared to a regionof normal bers. However, there can be clinically relevant ber abnormalities in the suspensory ligament that do not produce a detectable change in echogenicity on ultrasound images (Fig.4). These bers can have an abnormal signal pattern on MRI images that is not detectable withultrasound. In these cases, assessment of the fat and muscle becomes paramount as it can be the only indication of pathologic change in the suspen- sory ligament using ultrasound. In many cases it is accompanied by focal or diffuse ligamentenlargement. The lack of decreased echogenicity in the bers does not mitigate the clinical rele- vance of the abnormalities in the fat and muscledistribution. 4. Discussion Evaluation of the fat and muscle in the suspensory ligament provides important information regarding the diagnosis of pathologic change. Using this tech- nique over time will provide a knowledge base allow- ing a more accurate distinction between pathologic change and anatomic variation in the suspensoryligament. Whenever possible, comparison between ultrasound images and advanced imaging such as MRI should be performed, as this will provide a better understanding of the ultrasound images. MRI clearly demonstrates the normal characteristics and variation of all the salient anatomic features within the proximal metacarpal or metatarsal regions, which can then be correlated to ultrasound images. With experience, this information leads to a more accurateassessment of ultrasound images in the absence of an MRI. In dif cult cases where alterations in the fat and muscle are not detected initially with ultrasoundbut are evident on MRI images, it is often possible to identify these changes retrospectively on ultrasound images which can be used to monitor abnormalities over time. The subjective assessment of differencesin the appearance of the suspensory ligaments when comparing the fore or hind limbs, and whether to at- tribute these differences to anatomic variation or pathologic change, comes from experience in imaging different horses over time. There are rare cases with marked differences when comparing opposite limbs due to anatomic variation. However, the majority ofhorses fall within an expected range of variation, of which some subtleties cannot be detected withultrasound but only with MRI. Therefore, the oppo- site limb provides a reasonable guide during the learning process. In cases where there is not a de- tectable change in the echo pattern of the suspensoryligament bers, alterations of the fat and muscle bun- dles can be the only ultrasound visible indication ofclinically relevant pathologic change. Incorporatingassessment of the fat and muscle when using the on-and off-angle non-weight-bearing ultrasound tech-nique adds valuable information for the initial diagno-sis and monitoring over time. In addition, MRI ismost important in these cases to accurately character-ize the injury to the suspensory ligament. There arelimitations to this technique. The curve dorsally at their osseous attach- ments, and this will create variation in theechogenicity of the ligament when comparing the dor-sal and palmar or plantar aspects of theligament. The amount of curvature varies in differ-ent horses and therefore requires experience to determine anatomic variation versus pathologic change. However, in most horses this variationshould be relatively uniform and mild when compar-ing the medial and lateral aspects of theligament. When there is decreased echogenicity inthe dorsal aspect of the suspensory ligament, theother characteristics of the ligament should be closelyevaluated for other evidence that supports normalanatomic variation or pathologic change. Unfortun-ately, there are cases with decreased echogenicity inthe dorsal aspect of the ligament that is not represen-tative of pathologic change. However, no other evi-dence of injury is present, such as enlargement oralterations in the fat and muscle, and this appearanceis typically bilaterally present. Therefore, compari-son images are quite helpful in these cases. Anotherlimitation of this technique is that the tissue withinthe suspensory ligament margins that remains echo- genic regardless of beam angle can be fat and muscle or scarring. There is not a completely reliablemethod to distinguish fat and muscle from scarringon ultrasound images purely using the echogenicitybecause these tissue types will have a similar echopattern. However, scarring more typically occurswithin in the regions of suspensory ligamentbers. Therefore, the location of persistently echo- genic tissue within the suspensory ligament can behelpful in making this distinction. The complexanatomy of the hind suspensory ligament is alimitation. In addition, there is a vessel, the deepmetatarsal vein, that extends along the dorsal liga-ment margin in the proximal metatarsal region thatshould not be mistaken for decreased echogenicity inthe ligament. Color flow will not always create an appreciable signal in the vessel because it is quite dif-cult to place the ultrasound beam at the proper angle. The best way to detect the vessels is to follow from proximal to distal with the probe in an off-angle position. Tracking and demonstrating that theanechoic region extends outside the ligament marginsare helpful ways to differentiate a vessel fromHOW TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF ULTRASOUND IN THE FIELD 56 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSsuspensory ligament injury. In conclusion, complete ultrasound of the suspensory ligament requires aknowledge of the anatomy and normal anatomic vari- ation between limbs, as well as an understanding of how pathologic change alters the normal anatomiccharacteristics. Assessment of the fat and musclecan provide valuable insight into pathologic change,especially in cases that do not have obvious altera-tions in the echogenicity of the bers.

Introduction Recognition of the role that bio lms play in the per- sistence of chronic wounds and the lack of response to treatment in horses is increasing. Preventingbiolm development includes the following three main strategies: effective wound cleansing and de- bridement to reduce bacterial counts in wounds, appropriate use of advanced dressings, and use oftopical antimicrobial agents. Once bio lms are formed, eradicating them involves striking a bal- ance between improving the wound environment without harming the native cells that are inte-gral to the healing process, primarily throughrepeated lavage and debridement combined with topical antimicrobial therapy. The key points in this review are to understand why and howbiolms form, to recognize clinical indicators that bio lms have formed in equine wounds, and to be familiar with current diagnosticoptions and treatment strategies to eradicatebiolms. Clinical scenarios for cases in which biolms developed and were treated will be discussed. 2. Understanding Biofilms Bacterial bio lms are organized communities of bacteria that are typically attached to a surface (sessile) and enveloped in a 3-dimensional extracel- lular matrix (also as extracellular polymericsubstance [EPS]) that includes water, proteins,polysaccharides, glycolipids, bacterial DNA, and potentially other microbes that are bene ting from the protected environment.1-3Bacteria that produce bio lms are capable of surviving and growing at a slower rate in local environments depleted of nutrients and oxygen, termed phenotypicheterogeneity. 4Biolm formation is divided into the following three main stages: bacterial attach- ment, growth, and detachment.5Planktonic (free- floating) bacteria adhere to a surface within minutes (stage 1), and the individual bacterium alter their phenotype and secrete extracellular matrix after 6to 12 hours of attachment, growing and maturingbased on cell-to-cell signaling called \"quorum-sens- ing\" (stage 2). 6Biolms reach maturity within 2 to 4 days, and then begin to shed free- floating planktonic cells (stage 3), which disperse and attach to other areas of the wound bed. This dis-tribution of cells activates the immune response ofthe host animal, stimulating the production of exu-dates that provides further nutrients and promotessurvival of the bio lm. 7-9Once bio lms form, bac- teria differentiate into a complex community withincreased resistance to antibiotics, biocides, andenvironmental challenges such as desiccation andcells of the innate immune system. 10,11These obstacles in killing bacteria in bio lms may only be overcome if antimicrobials to which the bacteriaare sensitive can be delivered at adequate concen-trations for a suf cient time. 9 NOTES 58 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: WOUND MANAGEMENT3. Problems Caused by Biofilms Polymicrobial bio lms have been reported in multiple types of equine wounds (acute and chronic, traumatic, and surgical).12,13Factors that may predispose patients to bio lm formation in wounds include the immunocompetence of the patient (age, malnutrition,sepsis, corticosteroid administration, antibody de - ciency, chronic stress, or diseases affecting the pitui- tary-adrenal axis such as pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction [PPID] 's disease), inappropri- ate antibiotic sensitivity, reduced vascular perfusion to region, extensive wound contamination, or the pres- ence of foreign bodies, surgical implants, or sequestra. 7Preventing bio lm development in acute wounds includes successful wound cleansing and de- bridement to reduce bacterial counts and the appropri- ate use of advanced dressings and topical antimicrobialagents. Development of infection involving bio lms has important implications for the management of chronic wounds in horses, as they present unique chal- lenges in diagnosis and are more resistant to typicaltreatment methods. 8Wounds with bio lms may not exhibit signs typically associated with infection,although bio lms still prolong and impair healing as bacteria compete for metabolic resources and suppress the host in flammatory response in healing. 8The pres- ence of bio lms has been shown to delay epithelializa- tion and induce a chronic non-healing in flammatory phase in wounds.3,14Furthermore, bacteria within biolms are more tolerant to antimicrobial therapy administered topically (antiseptics) or systemically(antibiotics), as well as to the animal 'si n n a t ei m m u n e phagocytic response and environmental stresses as they are protected by their extracellular polymeric matrix.1For example, Staphylococcus aureus has been demonstrated to be up to 100-fold more resistant to antimicrobial therapy when growing in bio lms ver- sus in planktonic status.15Mature bio lms are imper- vious to commonly used antiseptics, such as hydrogenperoxide, alcohols, bleach, acids, and generators of oxy-gen radicals, unless these products are used at concen- trations toxic to the patient 'sc e l l s ,w h i c hi sn o t recommended. 16,17In addition, the ability of the ani- mal's immune response to effectively control microbes d e c r e a s e sa st h eb i o lm matures. Consequently, infec- tions involving bio lms frequently recur following dis- continuation of antibiotics.18Early recognition of the presence of bio lms in non-healing wounds and tar- geted treatment are key to the successful management of bio lms in equine practice. 4. Diagnosing Biofilms (Clinical Indications and Laboratory Testing) Recent studies have demonstrated that bio lms asso- ciated with wounds are most commonly polymicrobial bacterial communities that include more bacterial spe- cies than are identi ed by routine culture and sensitiv- ity methods.19-21Traditional culturing techniques are frequently inadequate to comprehensively identifybacterial species associated with bio lms.22Biolms in wounds can only be de nitively diagnosed using scanning electron or confocal micrography techni- ques19,23,24or molecular techniques to identify bacterial components within a bio lm,8which are not readily available to clinicians. Bio lms have been identi ed in 60% of chronic wounds and 6% of acute wounds inone study,20although more recent work suggests that biolms are involved in most, if not all, chronic wounds.24Multiple studies have documented evi- dence of bio lms in chronic wounds of horses specically.12,13 To review, typical methods to assess bacterial bur- den in wounds may be done qualitatively orquantitatively.25Qualitative assessment involves determining types of bacteria in wounds, coupled withsensitivity testing to guide antibiotic choices intreatment. Quantitative bacteriology is rarely per-formed in veterinary medicine but should be consid- ered when a wound is not progressing as anticipated or the skin graft fails. Bacterial counts greater than10 5per gram tissue or mL exudate has historically been considered to indicate active infection,26 although the number of bacteria needed to produceinfection may be dramatically reduced if bacterial vir-ulence is high, foreign material (suture, necrotic de-b r i s ,f o r e i g nb o d y ,a n di m p l a n t )a r ep r e s e n t ,o rh o s tresistance is decreased. 27For example, as few as 100 bacteria per gram of tissue or mL exudate may beneeded to incite infection with multidrug-resistant iso-lates, 28and polymicrobial infections with 2 or more different microorganisms act synergistically to resultin greater virulence than infection caused by eitherspecies alone. 29Although a single species may make up a bio lm, recent studies have provided evidence that bacterial isolates from chronic equine wounds are frequently polymicrobial, with an average number of species identi ed of 3.02 61.65 (range, 0 -8), and with the bacterial genera involved being similar to thoseidenti ed in human infections.12,13One study identi- edPseudomonas ,Enterococcus,a n d Staphylococcus members as the most common organisms in chronicwound bio lms in humans.22This nding further highlights the inadequacies of traditional culturemethods, as molecular analyses of chronic woundsamples has revealed far more diverse polymicrobialcommunities (up to 17 genera per wound), includinganaerobic species that are not identi ed by traditional culture. 20,30 Currently, the best diagnostic method available to equine practitioners when bio lms are suspected is to submit a deep tissue biopsy, a swab of the deepest tis-sues available, or both.8Following debridement of the wound, samples should be collected from multiplesites if possible, particularly from the deepest regionsof the wound (e.g., pockets and ssures). When prac- titioners swab wounds for sample collection, the swabshould be drawn across the surface of the wound withsufcient pressure to collect a sample of the bio lm itself. Drawing blood in the process of collecting thesample should be avoided, as blood itself containsBACK TO BASICS: WOUND MANAGEMENT AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 59antimicrobial elements that may affect culture results. Although tissue samples are more invasiveto collect, they are more likely to yield reliable culture results.12,13Ideally, all samples should be submitted prior to beginning or changing antimicrobial protocols. If deemed necessary to collect samples while horses are on antibiotics, it is recommended to notify the laboratory of the horse 's antibiotic regimen a n dw h e nt h el a s td o s ew a sr e c e i v e di nr e l a t i o nt osample collection.7If positive culture results are obtained, they should be interpreted with theassumption that the full microbial spectrum presentwithin the bio lm may be underrepresented. In lieu of a positive culture result, diagnosis of bio lms in wounds may be made based on clinical suspicion(Table 1). Clinical indicators of bio lms within wounds include excessive moisture, poor qualitygranulation tissue, indicators of in flammation (heat, swelling, pain, and redness), history of persistent orrecurrent infection despite antimicrobial therapy, negative culture results despite clinical suspicion of infection, or generally wounds remaining in a recal-citrant chronic in flammatory state despite address- ing comorbidities (e.g., immunosuppression) thatmay affect wound healing. As culture results indiagnosing bio lms are unreliable, observation of clinical indicators that bio lms are present should prompt practitioners to use wound care techniquesaimed at treating bio lms. 5. Biofilm Treatment Strategies Biolm-based wound-care (BBWC) strategies have been described in several recent consensus documentsin human wound care with the goal of providingpractical guidelines for clinical management for cases in which bio lms are suspected (Table 2).19,24,31,32These strategies emphasize repeated de- bridement to physically disrupt the bio lm matrix and remove devitalized tissues that serve as nutrients to the microbes.8Debridement disturbs the bio lm structure, allowing increased susceptibility to antimi- crobial therapies for a period of time that may preventbacterial reattachment, as immature bio lms are more vulnerable to antibiotics. 33Two principles of debridement in human wound care described byWolcott et al. include debriding with the goal of alter-ing the anatomy of the wound by undermining and removing all tissue surfaces that touch one another and removing devitalized and discolored tissue untilnormal bleeding tissue was encountered. 33Topical treatments are recommended to be applied within 4 hours of debridement or less, before bio lm reformation.34,35An example of the successful treat- ment of bio lms (and how quickly they reform in the absence of consistent therapy) includes removal of pla- que from dental enamel by using a combination of reg-ular tooth brushing (i.e., debridement) in combinationwith topical antiseptic mouthwashes. Furthermore, antiseptic mouthwashes are of minimal bene tw i t h - out preceding flossing and brushing. 7With this in mind, treatment of bio l m si nw o u n d si sr e c o m - mended in three stages, as follows: physically debrid-ing the bio lm, delaying or preventing reformation of biolms, and repeating until full resolution of the bio- lm is achieved.7Debridement of bio lms may be performed sharply (or bluntly with a scalpel blade), using pulsed water-jet irrigation or low-frequency ul-trasonic debridement, or mechanically with gauzeTable 1. Indirect Clinical Indications of Wound Bio lm19,31 Clinical Observation Biolm Explanations for Clinical Observation Excessive moisture associated with wound Bacteria in bio lms secrete extracellular matrix, and bio lm presence promotes in flammation, resulting in increased exudate. Autograft or allograft fails on wounds Applying tissue grafts over bio lms provides a second growth surface and food source, leading to devitalization of graft tissue and increased exudate and in flammation. Poor quality granulation tissue (e.g., hypergranular, friable)Biolm presence contributes to delayed epithelialization and is frequently associated with poor quality granulation tissue. Indications of local infection (swelling, sensitivity, redness, heat)Biolms promote in flammation and may be a precursor to other clinical indications of infection. History of persistent or recurrent infection despite antimicrobial therapyBiolm bacterial phenotypes adapt rapidly and may only demonstrate a 1 to 2 log reduction with antibiotic therapy at50/C2to 1000 /C2MIC. Bio lms contain persister cells that remain once antibiotic therapy is discontinued, seeding and contributing to subsequent bio lm reformation. Negative culture results despite clinical suspicion of infection or signs of bacterial colonizationBiolm bacteria metabolize more slowly and are phenotypically different than planktonic bacteria. Standard microbiologicalculture techniques are not capable of identifying all species present, making bacteria in bio lms dif cult or impossible to identify by culture. Wound remains in chronic in flammatory state and recalcitrant to therapy despite addressing comorbiditiesBiolms are resistant to host in flammatory responses and actually feed off exudate produced by in flammation, further promoting in flammation.BACK TO BASICS: WOUND MANAGEMENT 60 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSswabbed across the surface of the wound. To mini- mize discomfort for the patient during this step, it isrecommended that horses be sedated and the wounddesensitized with local or regional anesthesia. Insome instances, general anesthesia may be necessaryfor the rst debridement, if dictated by the patient' s temperament, or if the wound is extensive or not eas-ily accessed. Face protection or surgical masks maybe recommended for the veterinarian to protectagainst multidrug resistant infectious organisms or ifusing pulsed water-jet irrigation, which may aeroso-lize organisms to a greater extent. The overall objec-tive of debridement is to remove as much of thebiolm and associated extracellular matrix and devital- ized tissue as possible to expose remaining bacteria toantimicrobial agents. Reducing or preventing recon-stitution of bio lms following debridement may be achieved in several ways. Surfactants (polyhexa- methylene biguanide [PHMB] or polyhexanide) can be used adjunctive therapies at this time, as theyreduce bio lm surface tension, facilitating degradation and removal. Antiseptic agents do not penetrate ne-crotic debris and are unlikely to reduce bacterial popu-lations deep in the wound bed or withoutdebridement. In general, they should be reserved foruse on normal skin and not the wound bed. Examplesinclude acetic acid, alcohols, aluminum salts, boric provide ef cacy against bacteria within the wound bed and have minimal side effects on woundhealing (depending on the vehicle). Ideally, antimicro-bials are selected based on results of culture and sensi-tivity, and due to concerns with increasing incidence ofresistance, ones used topically should ideally be differ-ent to those administered systemically. Topical dress-ings including silver sulfadiazine (1%) or silver-impregnated wound dressings are currently used tocombat bio l m si nh u m a n sa n dm a yb eu s e di fa n t i b i - otic sensitivities are not available (leaper). However,their ef cacy is limited to the rst 24 hours, so these dressings must be changed frequently to maintain theireffect. 7If culture and sensitivity results are available, appropriate antibiotics may be applied topically withan enhanced effect. Additionally, topical application ofplasma (natural or hyperimmune for the speci cp a t h o - gen targeted) may be of bene t, as plasma inhibits theadhesion and growth of bacteria. 36-38The ef cacy of antibiotics delivered regionally (e.g., regional limb per-fusion) is also greater immediately after degradation ofthe bio lm, so timing of perfusion following surgical de- bridement may improve outcomes. In situations inwhich a positive antibiotic culture is not obtained or forinterim coverage in severely infected wounds, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is generally in-dicated. Combinations of penicillin G (procainepenicillin or crystalline) or cephalosporins (ceftiofur,cefazolin, or cephalothin) and gentamicin commonlyused. Collecting a separate swab to perform in-houseGram staining may also help to guide interim antibiotictherapy. In general, severely contaminated wounds orthose with bio lms are more effectively treated with bactericidal orthopedic implants frequently necessitate removal to eliminate the problem.39In these situations, ideally, infection is controlled by sys-temic and local antimicrobial therapy until suf cient healing of fractures or arthrodesis has occurred. Insituations in which both instability and infection arepresent, implants may be replaced or removed, soni-cated, cleaned, autoclaved, and reimplanted using newscrews and holes if nancially feasible. Alternatively, implants may be removed and unconsolidated fracturesmanaged with a trans xation pin cast or external xator. The fracture site, bone, and surrounding tis- sues may be debrided during the sterilizationprocess. The previous screw holes and surroundingregion may be packed with absorbable antibiotic elutingmaterials. Use of surgical drains or leaving the distalaspect of the incision open may facilitate drainage inthese cases. 39Debridement and efforts to impede reconstitution of wound bio lms should be repeated as frequently (daily or at least every other day) and for aslong as needed until the infection is resolved. Maturebiolms reform as quickly as 24 hours (up to 72 hours) following debridement, allowing a window of opportu-nity in which bactericidal drugs may have a greatereffect. It is recommended to monitor horses frequentlyand continue antibiotic therapy until signs of infectionhave resolved and wound healing is progressing asexpected. If improvement is not seen within 3 to 4days after the initiation of therapy, it is recommendedto review all aspects of the case, including repeatedphysical examination, bloodwork, evaluation ofTable 2. Key Statements on Bio lms in Wounds24 \u0081Biolms are present in most chronic wounds and are likely to be present on both the surface and deeper wound layers but may not be uniform across or within the wound. \u0081Biolms are dif cult to visualize macroscopically, and exudate, slough, or debris may be mistaken for bio lms. \u0081Wounds that contain bio lms may not be identi ed, leading to ineffective treatment and delayed healing. \u0081Important clinical indications that a wound likely contains a bio lm include a lack of response to treatment with antibiotics or antiseptics. \u0081Debridement is one of the most important treatment strategies against bio lms; however, bio lms reform rapidly, so debride- ment should be used in conjunction with topical antiseptics and surfactants.BACK TO BASICS: WOUND MANAGEMENT AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 61suitability of antibiotics administered, and further ex- ploration and debridement of the wound. Repeated bacterial culture and sensitivity may be indicated ifsigns of infection recur, response to therapy is less thananticipated, or during periods of prolonged antibiotictherapy, following discontinuation of antibiotics, if theinfection included multidrug-resistant or polymicrobialagents. In communicating with clients about the costof care, it is important to emphasize that the greatere x p e n s eo fa g g r e s s i v ed e b r i d e m e n ti nt h ee a r l ys t a g e sof wound management typically reduces the durationof therapy and overall costs of treatment long-term. 7Limitations of current laboratory testing and denitive clinical signs indicative of bio lms make it impossible to determine categorically whether a wound is bio lm free. Therefore, until a stall-side test is available to identify bio lm presence, the clinical pro- gression of wound healing with reduced slough and exu-date are the most effective methods of determiningresponse to therapy and resolution of bio lms in tissues. 40 6. Future Diagnostic Techniques and Treatment Strategies for Biofilms Future diagnostic tests may indicate more de nitively t h ep r e s e n c eo fb i o lms and where the bio lm is located within the wound. Stall-side or bedside tests to quantify wound bed protease activity may be onemethod to indirectly quantify the amount and viabil-ity of residual bio lm, as protease activity generally correlates to the amount of active bio lm. 19Novel techniques to reduce infection associated with bio lms are currently being investigated and developedfurther. They and cellular plasma, and mesenchymal stromalcells. 7,41- 48Further investigation of methods for improving outcomes in the management of bio lms in randomized controlled clinical trials is indicated. 7. Conclusions Recognition that most chronic wounds likely involve bacterial bio lms is key to successful treatment. Clinical indications that bio lms may be present include exudate, poor quality granulation tissue, other indications of localinfection, negative bacterial culture results de-spite clinical suspicion of infection, and woundsremaining in a chronic in flammatory state and re- calcitrant to therapy. The mainstays of therapy to reduce bio lm bacterial burden in wounds are repeated debridement and timely use of targeted topical antimicrobials and surfactantsthat have minimal cytotoxicity to nativetissues. Improved diagnostic tools in the future to detect the presence of bio lms and monitor response to treatment in a more sensitive manneras well as adjunctive therapies to degrade bio- lms may improve outcomes.

Introduction Devitalized tissue, because it has no blood supply, has no chance of becoming viable.1Accidental wounds of horses commonly contain devitalized tissue, bio lm colonized with multiple species of microorganisms, exu-date, and foreign debris. Devitalized tissue delayshealing by providing a focus for infection and by exac-erbating the in flammatory response. 2Removing non- viable tissue or foreign material through debridementreduces bacterial populations on the surface of thewound, which enhances healing. However, for heal-ing to proceed rapidly, as much viable tissue as possi-ble must be preserved. The wound should bedebrided when it is r s te x a m i n e d ,b u td e b r i d e m e n t may need to be repeated throughout healing to addressongoing necrosis and infection. Although dirt andloose debris may be rinsed away by using copious ster-ile irrigation, wound debridement is often used in com-bination with irrigation to adequately prepare thewound for optimal healing. Various techniques of de-bridement available in clinical practice include autoly-tic, mechanical, enzymatic, surgical, biological, andnegative pressure wound therapy. The method cho-sen depends on various factors, such as the type, size,location, and age of the wound; the extent of tissuedamage and contamination; patient tolerance; econom-ics; expertise of the caretaker; and availableequipment. More than one type of debridement is of-ten required to optimally prepare a wound forhealing. The following subsections discuss the morecommon techniques of debridement available to theequine practitioner with an aim to provide an overviewof the indications, cautions, and contraindications ofeach technique (Table 1). Autolytic Debridement Debridement occurs naturally within wounds by auto-lysis, a process whereby devitalized tissue is softenedor lique ed by enzymes, which are released by macro- phages, mast cells, endothelial cells, is lique ed), and vir- tually painless. This method uses the body 'so w n enzymes and moisture beneath a dressing, and nonvi-able tissue becomes lique ed. Dressing types com- monly used are hydrocolloids, hydrogels, and transparent lms Mechanical Debridement Mechanical debridement by debridement dressings. Adherent open mesh gauze may be applied to the wound, either dry to an exudative wound or wet- ted (generally with sterile saline solution) to a drywound. A clean bandage covers this dressing. Thedressing clings to the wound' s surface as it dries, so that when it is removed, tissue adhered to the gauze isalso removed. Open mesh gauze mechanical debride-ment is nonselective because both healthy and unheal-thy tissue are removed indiscriminately. Gauzedressings may disrupt angiogenesis, broplasia, and NOTES 64 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: WOUND MANAGEMENTepithelialization and, therefore, should be used exclu- sively for debridement and never beyond the in flamma- tory phase of healing. An in vitro study comparing the effectiveness of various dressings for debriding brin and blood clots in wounds of horses found that dressings hydrated with saline were better debriding devices than those hydrated with water because oftheir greater osmolarity.3Gauze and hydro ber dressings hydrated with saline were signi cantly (47%) more effective in breaking down protein (primar-ilybrin) than were dressings impregnated with colla- hydrogel dressing.3In study, saline dressings reached a plateau in their rateof protein breakdown within 24 hours. Although thisstudy did not consider the in vivo cellular effect on de-bridement, it did suggest that gauze, hydro ber, and alginate dressings wetted with saline would be mosteffective in debriding wounds with a proteinaceous coagulum or those that have formed scabs. An Antimicrobial gauze dressing ais an excellent dress- ing for treating heavily contaminated woundsbecause it is impregnated with polyhexamethylenebiguanide, a powerful yet safe antiseptic that hasa broad range effectiveness that has been shown tokill bacteria on the surface of the wound and decreasethe amount of exudate formation. Hypertonic saline gauze dressing cis ideal for treatment of necrotic, heavily infected exuding wounds. Calcium alginate dressingsd,eexert their bioactivity by stimulating macrophages within a chronic wound. In addition toproviding a moist environment that is conducive tocell growth and migration, these dressings generate aproin flammatory signal that promotes broplasia via a cascade of mediators released from activatedmacrophages. 4Occlusive dressingsfare used for sealing particular types of wounds and their sur-rounding tissue off from air, fluids, and harmful contaminants. Occlusive dressings promote moistwound healing and \"autolytic cellular debridement \" and are best used on clean wounds primarily free ofexudate. 5 Enzymatic Debridement Enzymatic debridement uses an ointment or gel with enzymes that soften unhealthy tissue. The enzymesmay come from an animal, plant, or bacteria. The papain-urea combination ointmentgmay be more effective at degrading brin within the wound bed. Collagenase ointmenthderived from Clostri- dium histolyticum m a yb em o r ee f f e c t i v ea td e g r a d i n g collagen and elastin. Proteolytic enzymes dissolve collagenous tissue and cause super cial debris and devitalized tissue to slough.6Collagenase or papain- urea-based agents may be used to speed the process of autolytic debridement in areas where surgical de-bridement is not possible or carries risk, such as inwounds that closely approximate nerves and/or bloodvessels. 7Factors that optimize enzymatic de- bridement include a good delivery system thatfacilitates contact between the enzyme and the arearequiring debridement, a sustained period of en-zymatic activity, and an optimal wound environ-ment. 8Frequently, proteolytic enzymes are applied along with other topical agents to address several objectives, including balancing moisture, managingexudate, controlling the measure of microbial contam- ination, and enhancing tissue regeneration. 9En- zymatic debridement be inhibited when com- bined with other wound dressings. For example, io-dine dressings and silver dressings have been shownto inhibit of collagenase, resulting in inef-fectual debride-ment. 9Because proteolytic enzymes cannot penetrate thick, hard, brinous eschar, they a r em o r ee f f e c t i v ew h e nt h en e c r o t i ct i s s u ei ss o f t . Astudy in horses evaluated the debriding ability ofenzymatic formulations. That study, using an in vitro m o d e lt os i m u l a t ead r y , brinous chronic wound eschar, showed that traditional gauzedressings, hydrated with isotonic saline solution orvarious forms nate dressing ( fluid-donating dressings), were more at and were streptokinase-streptodornase). 3En- zymatic wound debridement has limitations when treating accidental wounds of equids, which are oftenheavily contaminated and include a large amount ofnecrotic tissue; therefore, other forms of debridementmay be preferred.Table 1. open mesh dressing / Vol. 67 / 2021 65Surgical Debridement Surgical debridement includes the use low-frequency ultrasound-assisted debridement. Sharp surgical debridement using a scalpel is the optimal method for rapidly cleansing wounds containing a large amount of devitalized tis- sue and microbial contamination of the tissues. This method of debridement is very selective because the surgeon has complete control over which tissue to r e m o v ea n dt i s s u et or e m a i n . T h ei n t e n to fd e b r i d e - ment is to create a well-vascularized wound to sup- port second intention healing or skin grafting. The ability to correctly identify tissue types and anatomic structures is required to avoid in flicting further injury during surgical debridement. Aseptic technique pre-vents iatrogenic contamination. Repeat surgical de- bridement may be necessary or, alternatively, may be followed by another form of debridement, such as dressing-enhanced autolytic debridement. Various methods of surgical debridement include excisional, en bloc, piecemeal, and staged debridement. Excisional debridement may be layered, which involves sequential removal of devitalized tissue, progressing from the wound 'ss u r f a c et ot h ew o u n d 's depths, or en bloc, which entails excising the entire wound including itsmargin, so that all wounded and contaminated tissues are removed. En bloc debridement is often used for wounds with draining tracts. Piecemeal debridement is used for very large wounds, usually those of the trunk. Progressing from the beginning of the wound margin to the end, all devitalized tissue is removed a little at a time while preserving important anatomic structures. Staged debridement occurs over a number of days to avoid inadvertent removal of viable tissue. This approach is appropriate for most wounds on the distal aspect of the limb, where unwarranted re- moval of healthy tissue could have debilitating results. When surgical debridement is performed, the two governing criteria are color and attach-ment. White, tan, black, and green tissues, as well as those that are poorly attached, should be de-brided. Tissues that are pink to dark purple and that are well attached should be spared. Devitalized, nonarticular bone should be removed, whereas well-perfused bone with hardy soft- tissue attachments should be left. Fragments of bone with questionable viability or bone that has lost its per- iosteum should be aggressively debrided to reduce the risk of sequestration and to improve blood supply to the bone sur-face. Debridement of cortical bone is best accomplished with a bone rasp; however, a cu-rette, bone chisel, or osteotome can be used. Hydrosurgical debridement involves the use of pres- surized water or saline solution as a cutting/cleansing tool to rapidly and selectively debride a wound. A commercial hydrosurgical device igenerates a high- pressure ( 15 000 psi) jet of fluid (sterile saline solu- tion) that emerges through a 0.127-mm ori ce of the handpiece. Emergence of fluid from the outlet pro- duces suction (Venturi effect) that draws devitalized tissue into a cutting chamber where it is shredded andevacuated. Hydrosurgery can often be performed with the horse standing, but sedation and/or regional anesthesia may be required for restraint. Hy-drosurgical debridement is reported to be well tolerated because it is less painful than sharp debridement.10If hydrosurgery is used to debride a fresh wound that is to be sutured, some form of local anesthesia is neces- sary; conversely, local anesthesia is not usually required if hydrosurgical debridement is used to debr-ide a wound covered by granulation tissue that hasbeen left unsutured to heal by second intention. A recent ex vivo study comparing the ef cacy of different methods of debridement in reducing the load of Staphylococcus aureus from contaminated equine mus- cle showed that hydrosurgical debridement usingthe hydrosurgical more effective than irrigation with an isotonic saline solution, scraping with a scalpel blade, or a combination of irrigation and scraping.10Low-frequency, ultrasound-assisted debridementjuses low-frequency ultrasonic waves (20-60 mode,produced by streaming saline solution through tubinginto a sonotrobe resulting from oscillation of saline gas bubbles, cleaves necrotic tissue from healthy tissue, thereby debriding the wound and disrupting the bio lm; the necrotic tis- sue is suctioned or washed away.11Healthy, more elastic tissue is preserved and stimulated toepithelialize.12,13Because the recommended time of treatment is 20 to 30 sec/cm2of surface area, ultrasound-assisted debridement is likelyless applicable to debride large wounds commonlyfound in horses. 13 Biological Debridement Biological debridement involves the use of maggots,Lucilia sericata (green bottle fly), that are grown in a sterile environment and digest dead tissue andpathogens. Biological debridement is recommendedfor use in horses to enhance healing of subacute and chronic, nonhealing wounds when complete surgical debridement is dif cult and to enhance healing of obviously infected wounds. 14The sterile maggots a r ea p p l i e dt ot h ew o u n db e dw i t had r e s s i n gu s e dt o\"conne\"the maggots to the wound. The bene cial action of maggots on wound healing is attributed to producing potent proteolytic enzymes, upregulating expression of genes involved in wound healing, creat-ing an antiseptic effect, and inhibiting formation ofbiolm. 15-18During the process of dissolving brin and necrotic tissue, maggots also destroy and digestbacteria, and the excretions/secretions L. sericata possess signi cant antifungal properties.19In to the of the blow flyL. sericata , protease-resist- against methicillin-re- sistant Staphylococcus aureus in vitro.20Sterile maggots can be applied to a wound by using a direct(free-range) or indirect (contained) contact method. With the direct contact method, maggots are appliedBACK TO BASICS: WOUND MANAGEMENT 66 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSonto the wound with a dressing xed to the surround- ing healthy tissue. After the maggots are placed on the wound, a nylon mesh is xed to the dressing to conne the maggots within the wound. In the indi- rect contact method, maggots are supplied within aclosed polyester net lled with absorbent hydro- philic polyurethane foam and applied with the wound.21,22Biological debridement using the direct contact method is superior in the horse.23The direct m e t h o do fa p p l y i n gm a g g o t si sa l s ol e s se x p e n s i v et h a n the indirect method. In horses, biological debride- ment therapy is described as an alternative approach to the management of septic navicular bursitis, lami-nar necrosis associated with of the distal phalanx.22,24Biological debridement therapy has also contributed toward the successful healing of chronic nonhealing limb lacerations, orthopedic infections free of bony abscesses,supraspinous dehiscence of the linea alba following exploratory celiotomy.23In a retrospective study of 41 horses treated with biological debridement, a favorable response was noted less than 1 week afterinitiation of therapy.25Lesions of the horses enrolled in this study were subacute or chronic and had beenmanaged in diverse ways prior to receiving biologicaldebridement. A preliminary surgical debridement usually precedes biological debridement, although this may not be necessary in the absence of foreign bodiesand/or nonorganic matter in the wound. In some cases, after 3 to 4 days of biological debridement, a sec- ond treatment is required to reach the desired degreeof debridement, disinfection, and broplasia (i.e., to for each type of wound and anatomic location. 20,26For biological debridement to work effec- tively, free drainage of exudate is necessary and the maggots must have an adequate supply of oxygen. Negative-Pressure Wound Therapy Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is amethod for controlling wound infection and enhancingwound healing. Indications for the use of NPWT inveterinary medicine include traumatic wounds (avul- sions, degloving, injuries), full-thickness burns, incisions, myofascialcompartment syndrome, and chronic nonhealingwounds. 27-29NPWT is also excellent for enhancing ac- ceptance of free grafts, and it can be used effectivelyover sutured incisions to splint closures under ten-sion, prevent formation of a seroma, particularly in closed incisional wounds with underlying dead space, and minimize edema. 29-32NPWT stimulates the rapid formation of granulation tissue, reduces the size of the wound, and effectively removes fluid from the wound.33,34The early appearance of granulation tis- sue is remarkably consistent with the use of NPWT and correlates with observed increases in broblast activity and angiogenesis.33,35Although NPWTshould not replace the basic tenets of wound manage- ment, such as cleansing, debridement, irrigation, and treatment for infection, its use for debridement of an infected wound is likely to stimulate broplasia and increase resistance to infection early in the post-wounding period. 36Other identi ed and validated mechanisms of NPWT include the removal of intersti-tialfluid; thereby reducing edema; altered blood flow to the wound; and upregulated gene expression ofcytokines associated with wound healing. 37-40NPWT involves sealing the wound from the environment anddelivering a controlled subatmospheric pressure, typi- cally not exceeding -125 mmHg, to the entire wound. Fluid produced by the wound is collectedinto a disposable reservoir canister attached to the pump. The open-cell nature of the foam and the cell size of 400 to 600 mm ensure an even distribution of negative pressure to the entire surface of thewound. NPWT may be particularly useful in the treatment of wounds of horses allowed to heal by sec- ond intention. NPWT prevents retraction of thewound margins, decreases the size of the wound, reduces wound edema, and stimulates early onset of broplasia. Granulation tissue forms earlier in wounded tissue treated by NPWT and is smoother,nonexuberant, and has well-organized collagen bers, as demonstrated histologically. 41This makes wounds treated with NPWT less likely to develop \"proud flesh\"and more amenable to early reconstruc- tive procedures, such as skin grafting. Furthermore,NPWT increases the likelihood of acceptance of a free skin graft by immobilizing grafts at the wound. 30,42 2. Conclusion To promote healing, reduce risks of infection, and improve patient outcomes, an array of debridement methods can be included in the patient's wound man- agement plan of care. The use of more than one de- bridement method will provide consistency in wound bed preparation toward healing.

Introduction Second intention wound healing is best performed with dressings that will keep the woundmoist. Modern wound healing dressings are designedto provide the appropriate amount of moisture reten-tion for the stage of wound healing. Moist woundhealing occurs when the wound exudate is allowed tostay in contact with the wound bed. Studies on peoplehave shown that full thickness skin wounds kept in amoist environment re-epithelialize in approximately12-15 days, whereas the same wound exposed to the air will take 25- 30 days to heal. 1,2The wounds are less inflamed, cause less itching, have less eschar for- mation, and are more likely to heal without scarring. Wound exudate in the absence of infection provides a substrate rich in enzymes, growth factors,and chemotactic factors. The enzymes are a byprod-uct of the breakdown of polymorphonuclear cells andmacrophages. The enzymes allow the debridement ofthe devitalized tissue, improving the \"foundation \"for wound healing to proceed. This has been termed au- tolytic debridement. Autolytic debridement occursbetween 72 and 96 hours depending upon the thicknessof eschar and the size/location of the wound and isachieved under occlusive dressings, provided thewound bed remains in contact with the woundfluid. Growth factors provide a stimulus for the bro- blasts and epithelial cells. The chemotactic factorsstimulate the migration of more neutrophils and mac-rophages to phagocytize bacteria and debris whilereleasing enzymes to further promote autolyticdebridement. A moist environment allows better migration of neutrophils and macrophages than a dry wound environment. Occlusion provides aconstant thermal regulated environment leading to healthier cells, and if the appropriate dressing is chosen then bacterial penetration is reduced or prevented. Disadvantages of moist healing include bacterial colonization, folliculitis, the pos- sibility of trauma to peri-ulcer borders, and, at least in people, allergies to the dressing material. There can be a ne balance between drying out of the wound and maceration of peri-wound tissue. Fortunately, there are new dress- ings available to help the practitioner in determin- ing what to use in each case to provide an optimum wound healing environment. 1,2 Many dressings have been used in the treatment of lacerations and abrasions in horses. Nonadherentdressings and gauze dressings are probably the mostcommon dressings used. Both of these dressings are porous, allowing fluid transfer from the wound to the overdressing and from the outside of the bandage tothe wound surface. If woven gauze is used, the wound exudate is quickly absorbed through the gauze and into the overdressing. This is termed vertical wicking . If nonwoven gauze is used, the wound exu- date tends to flow to the edge of the gauze quickly and then is absorbed into the overdressing. This istermed horizontal wicking. The amount of moisture retention is dependent upon many factors includingthe amount of exudate and the type of gauze, the sec- ondary dressing, and the frequency of dressing NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 69BACK TO BASICS: WOUND MANAGEMENTchange. It is dif cult when using a gauze dressing to maintain a moist wound-healing environment even if a wet to dry bandage is used.3Occlusive dressings isolate the wound from the external environment providing many bene ts over a simple gauze dressing. The occlusiveness of a dressing is meas- ured by the evaporation of fluids from the wound sur- face through the dressing and ranges from minimallyocclusive to completely occlusive. The bene ts of occlusion include rapid autolytic debridement with less necrotic tissue, a bacterial barrier, a waterproof barrier, a decrease in pain associated with wound/dressing, ease of use, fewer dressing changes, anddecreased wound healing time. The fears about occlusion are mainly centered around infection. All wounds are colonized with bacteria while they maynot be actually infected. Infection in general refers to invasion of bacteria to the 10 5power in live healthy tissue. Signs of infection include edema, erythema, induration, and fever. Although there are concerns, studies have shown that occlusive dressings are not associated with increased rates of infection.3The ideal dressing should keep the ulcer bed continuallymoist and the surrounding skin dry, or more simply stated, a dressing should manage the amount of exu- date present. This determination will be dependenton clinical judgment. 3 2. Wound Dressings There are probably as many different wound dress- ings as there are wound cleaning agents.3This lec- ture will focus on the agents the presenter has the most experience with. Wound dressings should be chosen based upon the stage of wound healing the wound is in. The author is not aware of any singledressing that provides bene ts throughout all stages of the wound healing process. Consequently, theappropriate dressing will vary through the woundtreatment. In general, the stages of wound healingcan be divided into the following: debridement, wound moistening, granulation tissue development and wound contraction, and epithelialization. Thewound should be kept moist in all of these stages as moist wounds will generally heal in half the time as wounds left exposed to air, as long as the appropriatedressing is chosen. 1,2 Debridement Dressings Debridement dressings are designed to remove bacteria and necrotic tissue from the wound. Debridement dressings should often be combined with some type of sharp debridement where the bulk of the necrotic tissue is removed from the wound prior to dressing application. Hypertonic Saline Hypertonic saline saline. They provide an aggressive, nonselective debridement. They work by drawing the fluid out of bacteria and diseased cells, reducing their attachment to the wound bed, and thenlifting them out of the wound when the dressings are changed. In the author 's opinion, they are the most effective debridement dressings available.aHypertonic saline can be made by dissolving 200 g of salt in 1 L of boiling water. Lower concentrations of hypertonic sa- line do not appear to be as effective. This debridement dressing should be discontinued when the wound no lon-ger appears infected. Antimicrobial Dressing One antimicrobial dressingbis a loosely woven gauze impregnated with polyhexamethylene biquanide(PHMB). PHMB is an antimicrobial that disrupts the cell walls of microorganisms. There is no devel- oping resistance known to PHMB.3The dressing was originally developed to apply over a wound to stop bacterial penetration (it is also used in baby wipes and contact lens cleaning solutions). It is now accepted that the dressing will kill bacteria when placed into a wound as well. It comes as a dry dress- ing and should be moistened with saline prior to use in a wound. Similar to hypertonic saline, this dress-ing should not be used as a primary dressing after the wound has been effectively debrided and the bacterial numbers have been appropriately reduced. It can, however, be used as a secondary dressing to limit bac- terial penetration to the wound bed.4 Honey Honey has been used to improve wound healing for centuries. Some types of honey, such as honey derived from speci c plants like the Manuka bush, seem to have even more antimicrobial effect than would be seen withthe natural hyperosmolality present in all honey. Not all honey is created equal in this effect, so only honey that is known to have antimicrobial bene ts (Manuka honey) should be used in wound care.5,6 Moistening Dressings Although most of the wounds presented to the veteri- nary practitioner are necrotic and infected, some wounds are dry, often from inappropriate wound care. In these wounds, a gel dressing should be applied to \"donate\" moisture to the wound and improve the wound healing process. Gel dressings commonlycontain water, glycerin, and a polymer. Some geldressings incorporate a gauze that helps them main- t a i nt h e i rn o r m a ls h a p e . E i t h e rt h ea m o r p h o u so rt h e formed dressings can be used to add moisture to a dry wound. As soon as the wound is moist, another dress- ing should be used. Granulation Tissue Development and Wound Contraction Dressings Calcium Alginate In the past, exuberant granulation tissue has been the bane of the equine practitioner, and to think that one might choose a dressing speci cally to encourage gran- ulation tissue would have been frowned upon. However, one of the complications of equine woundBACK TO BASICS: WOUND MANAGEMENT 70 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGShealing is the lack of in flammatory response that is formed by the horse after wounding.7Calcium algi- nate dressings will lead to an effective in flammatory process that will help wound healing proceed in an effective order. Another valuable bene to ft h ea l g i - nate dressings is that they contain a lot of calcium thatis\"donated\" to the wound to encourage wound contrac- tion. These dressings can also be placed directly onexposed bone that has been curetted to minimize bonesequestrum formation. As soon as granulation tissuells the wound, these dressings should be discontinued. Epithelialization Dressings Semi-occlusive foam dressingschelp to nish off the wound healing process. The foam dressings willincrease the surface temperature of the wound by 1 -2 degrees, which will preferentially select forepithelialization. 3They are a relatively closed cell design so that the granulation tissue does not growinto the foam. The added bene to ff o a mi st h a ti t contains the same PHMB as described above in thedebridement dressings to limit bacterial growth onthe surface of the wound. It is not recommended toadd any other agent to the wound during the epitheli-alization process. In summary, there are manyoptions for wound dressings that have either negativeeffects or unknown effects on the wounds. It is theveterinarian 's job to make sure to select a wound cleaning agent or a dressing that will encourage themost functional and cosmetic end result. The authorfeels that the best healing results will occur with wounds that are covered and kept moist through the healing process regardless of the location of the woundon the horse. If uncertain what the dressing does,nd out before using it. Many of these materials have quite detrimental effects on the wound. 3Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of Veterinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Introduction Skin grafting is generally reserved for wounds that have a very large skin defect that would not heal func-tionally or cosmetically with standard wound therapyintervention. Skin grafts not only cover granulationtissue and result in a more cosmetic end result, butthey also have been shown to encourage wound con-traction and epithelialization while decreasing exu-berant granulation tissue. 1Skin grafting in itself is not a dif cult procedure. Most of the effort involves appropriate preparation of the wound bed and skingraft prior to placement and effective immobilizationof the grafted area after skin graft placement. Thewounds should be treated with moist wound healing concepts to prepare the wound bed to receive the skin graft (see the presentation on wound caredressings). 2The most common circumstances that will lead to failure in skin grafting are infection, poorgranulation tissue, and excess movement at the grafts i t e . C o n s e q u e n t l y ,t h ew o u n db e dm u s tb ef r e eo finfection and have a healthy granulation tissue bedprior to grafting. If a previous graft has failed, quan-titative bacterial analysis should be performed priorto placing a second graft. If the wound is over a siteof excess movement, some type of wound immobiliza-tion, such as splinting or casting, should beperformed. Regardless of the location of the wound,it is recommended to leave the original dressing inplace for 7 days prior to changing. This will reducethe chance of dislodging the grafts. There are threemain types of skin grafts used in the horse:autografts, allografts, and xenografts. Autograftsc o m ef r o mt h es a m ea n i m a l s ,a l l o g r a f t sa r ef r o mt h esame species, and xenografts are from otherspecies. Xenografts, such as porcine skin and sh skin, are not really integrated into the host animal;they are really just used as biological bandages. 2. Healing Stages of Skin Grafts The healing stages of skin grafts are generallybroken into four major categories: adherence,plasmic imbibition, revascularization, and nal organization. Adherence occurs on day 1 beforeany other healing stages can occur. This is gen-erally created by brin between the graft and the wound bed. This distance between the graft andthe bed should be small to minimize dif culties later in the healing process. Movement at thisstage will often lead to graft failure. Plasmaticimbibition occurs from days 1 to 4 where nutritionfor the graft comes from the brin clot around the graft. Cyanosis of the grafted tissue is expected dur-ing this phase. Revascularization occurs betweendays 3 and 7. There are at least three different meth-ods for revascularization. Inosculation occurs whenvessels in the graft anastomose with vessels in the re-cipient bed and is the most rapid method ofrevascularization. Capillary buds can penetrate fromthe recipient bed into the graft vessels, using them as aconduit to revascularize the graft. Capillary budsmay penetrate the graft in areas other than old vesselsto revascularize the graft. This is the slowest method NOTES 72 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: WOUND MANAGEMENTof revascularization since the growth rate of capillary buds is approximately 1 mm/day. The greater the dis-tance between the graft and the recipient bed, the more likely that capillary buds will have to form an entirely new vascular network and the greater likeli-hood of graft failure. The nal stage of healing is or- ganization where brous tissue replaces the brin of the original clot to hold the graft permanently inplace. Fibroblasts are responsible for laying down the collagen during organization. The collagen bers and neovascularization provide a rm attachment of the graft to the recipient bed within 9 days of grafting. 3. Graft Thickness Full-thickness grafts are composed of both the dermis and epidermis. Partial-thickness grafts are com- posed of the epidermis and part of the dermis. Both full-thickness and partial-thickness grafts can be used in horses. Full-thickness grafts tend to give morecosmetic end results because they have all of the adnexal structures such as hair follicles and skin glands. However, they are more dif cult to apply successfully because they are thicker and take longer to vascularize. Partial-thickness grafts tend to have a better success rate but have a lesscosmetic end result. When choosing the donor s i t e ,i ti sb e s tt os e l e c tas i t et h a tw i l ln o tl e a v ea signi cant cosmetic blemish. Either the side of the neck under the mane or the ventral abdomen or pectoral region where there is redundant skin are the common sites. A secondary considerationis the hair color. 4. Graft Types/Techniques Grafts can either be harvested manually or by using motorized equipment. Most practitioners will har- vest using manual techniques. The bene to fe v e n graft thickness when using motorized equipmentis often outweighed by the cost of motorizedequipment. No matter the method, the grafted tissue must have adequate capillary exposure by keeping the graft in close approximation to thegranulation bed to allow in-growth of blood vessels. The recipient bed must have adequate capillary supply, and the practitioner mustprovide protection from mechanical disruption, hematoma formation, and infection. Skin graft- ing can be performed using many differenttechniques. The techniques will be listed in order of easiest to most complex. Pinch Grafting Pinch grafting requires the least amount of equip- ment of the listed techniques. The grafting can be performed with a number 12 scalpel blade, a thumb forceps, and a mayo scissors. The skin is tented with the thumb forceps and cut off with the scalpel blade. The grafts should be no larger than 8 to10 mm in diameter. The subcutaneous tissue isremoved with scissors. Pockets, approximately 1 cm apart, are made in the granulation tissue with thescalpel blade, and the grafts are placed into the shal-low pockets. The graft site is dressed with a nonad-herent dressing aor petroleum impregnated dressings and a pressure bandage applied. This technique canbe performed in the standing horse. Punch Grafting Punch grafting requires similar instrumentation as does the pinch grafting as well as 6-mm and 8-mm skin punches. The 8-mm punch is used at the do-nor site to cut through the epidermis anddermis. The subcutaneous tissue is trimmedfrom the graft and the graft placed on saline-soaked gauze. It is best to maintain normal ori-entation of the hair on the grafts for the most nor-mal cosmetic result at the wound site. The 6-mmpunch is used at the wound site to remove a gran-ulation tissue plug. The granulation tissue plugsare removed, cleaned of blood, and lled with the skin plugs. The graft site is dressed with a non- adherent dressing aor petrolatum impregnated dressings and a pressure bandage applied. This technique can be performed in the standing horse. Tunnel Grafting Tunnel grafting requires removing long narrow strips of skin from the donor site. A long forceps is tun- neled under the granulation tissue and used to grasp the skin graft. The skin is pulled (taking care to maintain normal orientation) through thegranulation tissue, and the ends are sutured tothe surrounding skin. The wound is dressed asdescribed above. Approximately 6 to 10 dayslater, the granulation tissue is surgically removedover the skin grafts. More skin is placed into thewound than with pinch or punch grafts, but lessspecialized equipment is necessary when com-pared to sheet grafting. This technique generallyrequires general anesthesia. Sheet Grafting Full-thickness sheet grafting will generally give the best cosmetic result. However, it requires the most specialized equipment and has the greatest chance forfailure. The biggest reason for failure is movementof the graft over the wound bed inhibiting the in-growth of capillaries. One way to reduce theproblems with graft movement is to \"mesh \"the graft. Graft meshing is bene cial for two main reasons. It allows evacuation of exudate frombetween the graft and the wound bed, and it allows coverage of a larger area without having to remove as large of a graft from the donorsite. Sheet grafting is best performed with a der-matome that will remove a similar-thicknesssheet from the donor site. The dermatome can beset to remove a partial-thickness or a full-thick-ness graft. The harvested graft can then beplaced through a mesher to \"mesh \"the graft forBACK TO BASICS: WOUND MANAGEMENT AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 73the reasons previously described. The graft is sutured into place around the periphery of thewound and then dressed as previously described. This technique requires general anes- thesia. \"MEEK \"micrografting, which especially promising. Pedicle grafting requires that there is enough skinclose to the wound defect to be able to rotate skin intothe area while still leaving at least some vascular sup-ply intact. In most cases, this technique is used inthe head region of horses, especially to cover stulas over the maxillary sinus. The donor site may have tobe left open to heal by second intention. The distallimbs do not have enough extra skin in most cases torotate tissue. This technique requires generalanesthesia. 5. Conclusion Skin grafting can be a relatively simple techniquefor the equine practitioner to perform. The cos-metic end result is often superior to second inten-tion healing. Care must be taken to minimizemovement and bacterial numbers to provide themost successful results.Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of Veterinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Introduction In recent years, fewer graduating veterinarians are seeking a career in equine private practice, and about half of young graduates leave the equine sector within 5y e a r s .1A recent study has indicated that practices with more than four doctors have the highest numberof departures, with close to 25% of respondents leaving. Remarkably, solo practices demonstrated the lowest rate of departure from the industry (10.45%).2Reasons fewer solo practitioners are leav- ing the profession may include the numerous positiveaspects of solo practice: the authority to take command of one 's professional and personal life, the ability to shape a speci c brand identity that plays to one 's strengths, and the nancial bene ts of owning a pro t- able business. Solo practice presents its own uniqueset of challenges that include increased responsibilities, isolation, and the high likelihood of being the sole pro- vider of emergency services. However, with creativ- ity,flexibility, and collaboration, unique solutions can be developed. In the author' se x p e r i e n c e ,t h eb e n e ts of solo practice have far outweighed any negatives andhave led to an incredibly ful lling career path, one uniquely its own. 2. Discussion In solo equine practice, it can be easy to fall into the trap of trying to \"be everything to everyone. \"The- nancial and human capital of larger practices may allow them to successfully execute this paradigm andoffer a wide array of specialized skills and services. Asolo practitioner often does not have the personal orbusiness resources of larger practices. Therefore, asolo practitioner must accept the limitations of beinga one-doctor organization and realize that taking on auniversal provider role (ful lling all of a client 'sn e e d s for their horse) is unrealistic and could negativelyimpact their well-being. However, an advantage ofsolo practice is the ability to create a practice model re-flective of one' s professional goals, unique skill set, and personal lifestyle. Clients increasingly seek veterinarians with speci- alized training for certain aspects of their horse 's health. Today 's general equine practitioner may NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 75KEEPING EQUINE PRACTITIONERS IN EQUINE PRACTICEprovide a combination of basic skills and advanced education in one or two areas of interest such as lame- ness, dentistry, chiropractic, or acupuncture. It is ad- vantageous when these advanced skill sets do notoverlap amongst practitioners within the region. Thisprovides an opportunity for referring cases to neighbor-ing practitioners with different skill sets andequipment. For example, practitioner A may refertheir dental extractions to practitioner B who has alarge amount of advanced dentistry experience, whilepractitioner B refers their gastroscopy cases topractitioner A because of a lack of appropriateequipment. Solo practitioners with a speci cs p e c i a l interest have the option to limit their practice \u2014for example, providing only dentistry services or integra-tive therapy. By setting limits on the services theyoffer, these practitioners can decrease their frequencyof emergency calls from clients, minimize their invest-ment in equipment, and focus the development of their expertise in an area of practice that is highly protable or of personal interest. Practices that are limited in scope are increasing in frequency, often offering unique solutions to dif cul- ties within the equine veterinary space. For exam-ple, emergency-only and relief practices are reducingthe burden of emergency coverage for small practicesand for those veterinarians with injuries, maternityleaves, or other needs to take time away from theirpractices. While practices such as these are few innumber, they offer solutions to the problems that neg-atively in fluence the decision to leave equine practice. 2Other specialized practices, including those limited to dentistry and/or integrative medicine(chiropractic and acupuncture), often provide exper-tise without negatively impacting the general practi-tioner through competition for services. There are also unique solo practices that are transient and involve traveling to different venues and providingveterinary services to a niche horse population suchas racehorses or show horses. Once committed to a solo practice, there is complete freedom to determine how to present the practicewithin the industry. The solo practitioner can createa brand that is re flective of their uniqueness as an individual. Personal attributes such as kindness,compassion, empathy, humor, con dence, reliability, and effective communication possessed by the individ-ual practitioner can establish the practice identity.Clients are in fact choosing the brand of the individualveterinarian when choosing the practice brand. Whenclients choose a veterinarian with whom they sharevalues and priorities, their satisfaction with their ex-perience may be improved. Likewise, the doctor 's work satisfaction may be increased by serving clientswho appreciate their brand identity and have chosenit deliberately. As they develop their practice, the owner must have a clear vision of what they want to create, for without adestination to aim for, progress is dif cult to measure and action steps are hard to formulate. Brandinghelps to de n et h ep a t ht oo n e 'sp i n n a c l e \u2014oftencreating the image before it fully comes tofruition. Owners of solo practices have complete authority over the brand 's development and expression. Their dreams, values, and opinions deter- mine the expression of the company logo, merchandise,website design, and social media presence. The pro-cess of branding can be incredibly exciting for a creativeindividual. The strongest brands provide a consistent experi- ence with every customer touchpoint. Daily interac-tions with clients, whether these are in person, overthe phone, or by text or email, have the greatestimpact as the solo practitioner is consistently reinforc-ing their brand with each interaction. A client' s trust builds with every positive interaction when theirexperience meets their expectation. This trust cre-ates a strong, valuable brand that is in highdemand. When your brand is \"who you are, \"it will be strong and consistent simply by just being yourself. A solo practitioner is capable of earning compensa- tion equal to or exceeding that of a high-producing as-sociate while grossing only a fraction of the associate 's production. This is possible because the solo practi-tioner is paid not only for their effort as a veterinar-ian, as an associate is, but also receives the net pro t from the business. Practice pro ts of 17% to over 20% are considered excellent and are not uncommonin ambulatory practice. 3Operating an ambulatory practice requires signi cantly lower upfront and over- head costs compared to its brick-and-mortar counter-parts, with facility and equipment costs typically 5%to 6% less in ambulatory practices. 3Business man- agement, which is crucial to success, may be a learn-as-you-go process for the solo practitioner, but it doesn o th a v et ob e . F o r t u n a t e l y ,t h e r ea r en o wv e t e r i -nary peer groups aimed at educating the young practitioner. 4Thenancial bene ts of business own- ership are immense. It is one of the surest ways to - nancial freedom and success, including student loan repayment and retirement savings. The life of an equine veterinarian can be hard, and it can be even harder for a solo practitioner that is re-sponsible for all patient care, client communication,business management, and emergency duties. Relieffrom some of the challenges of equine practice can begained from the formation of strong boundaries.Authority over oneself implies authority over one 's boundaries and does not require others 'approval. It is essential for the solo practitioner to clearly identifyboundaries speci c to their goals and lifestyle. While the skill of implementing boundaries is learned overtime, it is much easier to have these boundaries inplace when rst starting. One of the positive aspects of solo practice is having the ability to set norms andboundaries that are unique to your needs. Examples of questions the solo practitioner should ask themselves when creating boundaries include thefollowing: 1. What or who has priority over my time or business?KEEPING EQUINE PRACTITIONERS IN EQUINE PRACTICE 76 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGS2. What are my normal business hours? 3. What type of client communication, if any, am I comfortable with after hours? 4. Will I see emergencies for nonclients?5. What can I do to assure that I am paid at the time of service? 6. What are my nonnegotiables for my practice of veterinary medicine? 7. What do I consider inappropriate or abusive behavior from clients? What will I do when Iexperience this? By creating thoughtful boundaries at the outset of forming a practice, a veterinarian can communicateexpectations to clients clearly from their rst interac- tions, preventing misunderstandings and creating thefoundation of a consistent client experience. By cre-ating space for time away from the practice throughstrong boundaries, a solo practitioner can protect theirsustainability in the equine space. In addition to nancial success, solo practice also provides the extraordinary opportunity to have soleauthority over the work-life continuum as it changesthroughout the life of the practitioner. The needs ofan individual change as they age, if they choose tostart a family, or if they get seriously sick orinjured. In solo practice, there is no one from whichto get permission should you need a day off for a doc-tor'sa p p o i n t m e n t ,w a n tt ob ea ty o u rk i d 's basketball game in the afternoon, or want to skip town for a con-cert or vacation. Having this level of personal free-dom requires a strong reciprocal relationship with aneighboring colleague or emergency cooperative sothat the needs of your clients are taken care of duringyour time away. The modern solo practitioner need not be the \"lone wolf\"but instead can develop collaborative relation- ships with their peers. Younger practitioners enter-ing into this profession may nd themselves at an advantage when developing relationships with theircolleagues both near and far. \"Millennial 'se a r l y( a n d constantly supervised) exposure to team sports hasmade them the best team players and collaborators ingenerations, \"according to Jessica Brack fosters prac- titioners 'ability to learn from one another, ask for help when needed, and ful ll clients' needs when their requirements are beyond a particular practitioner 's scope of practice. Examples of collaboration amongneighboring colleagues include sharing emergency cov-erage (especially during times of injury or extendedmedical or maternity leave), sharing or renting equip-ment between practices, providing medication or sup-plies if a fellow practitioner runs out unexpectedly, orreferring cases to another practitioner who has greaterexperience, skill, or necessary equipment. Technology has completely changed how we connect with our peers. It has eliminated the physical bar-rier of distance, allowing the ability to source feedbackfrom colleagues from nearly anywhere in the world. In the author' s experience, the degree of ur- gency required by the situation dictates the form oftechnology chosen. When immediate feedback isrequired, digital images sent through text and videochat allow for instantaneous communication betweentwo colleagues. Both the American Association ofEquine Practitioners listservs and various memberFacebook groups (e.g., Equine Vet-2-Vet, Women inEquine Practice) allow veterinarians to connect andcollaborate with colleagues without a previouslyestablished relationship. Both formats can create anenvironment that mimics hospital clinician roundsthat were once inaccessible to solo practitioners. Thepersonal opinions expressed within these formats are colored with years of experience. They provide prac- tical advice, quick tips one never learns in school or atextbook, and most importantly, the sense that one isnot alone in their struggles. Through these groups,one learns that we are all good at some things and notat others, we are all learning, and perfection is afacade. When a veterinarian practices by themselveson a daily basis, knowing they are not alone in thesestruggles is a lifeline. In fact, these days, all of usare more connected than ever. 3. Conclusion Solo practice is not for everyone. But those who undertake its challenges can experience a life and ca- reer that is professionally, nancially, and personally rewarding beyond measure. For those looking todene success and a life well lived for themselves, solo practice can be the right vehicle for them to executetheir vision.

This may understand- ably lead to burnout, especially in small one- or two-doctor practices, and is a top reason why practi- tioners are choosing to leave equine practice.1The establishment of an emergency cooperative among local practitioners is one model that can be utilized in some areas to allow a better work-life balancewhile still providing an important service for clients.

Introduction The equine profession in the United States is not retaining or replacing the veterinarians needed toservice the population of horse owners. Fewer grad- uate veterinarians are choosing to enter equine prac- tice, and retention of those who do is poor, with overhalf dropping their membership in the AmericanAssociation of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) and pre-sumably leaving equine practice within the rst 5 years after their graduation (AAEP 2019 SurveyData). Many of those choosing to leave cite the life-style and number of hours of work required as the topreasons why. 1The current working conditions required of equine practitioners may simply be unten-able for many professionals who are disproportionallyfemale and burdened by more hours of householdwork and childcare. 2,3One speci c cause of equine practitioners' b u r n o u ta p p e a r st ob eaf u n c t i o no ft h e demand of providing 24/7/365 emergency care, whichrequires a veterinarian to be available and ready towork at all hours. This is an essential part ofveterinary care, and in many states like Florida, this is written into the state practice act. 4To address this burden, small animal medicine has turned to amodel of after-hours clinics specializing in emergencycare. However, this model has rarely been adoptedby equine practitioners in the United States. Asidefrom leaving the eld, equine veterinarians have dealt with this issue by joining larger practices, hiring reliefveterinarians (i.e., veterinarians that provide serviceson an as-needed basis when full-time vets are awayfrom their practice), or choosing to specialize in a serv-ice that does not require the provision of emergency care (e.g., dentistry, sports medicine, acupuncture, chiropractic, etc.). Another option to reduce thedemands of emergency work is to share the burden byforming a local emergency cooperative. These coop-eratives are groups of independent local practitionersthat agree to share emergency coverage for eachother 's clients, returning care to the client' sr e g u l a r veterinarian during business hours. There are sev-eral advantages to this type of approach: (1) it has thepotential to be easily and quickly put into action, (2) it NOTES 78 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSKEEPING EQUINE PRACTITIONERS IN EQUINE PRACTICEallows practitioners to maintain their small one- or two-doctor independent practice while reaping some benets of being in a larger practice, and (3) it pro- vides increased collegiality in what can be an isolatingprofession. While there are clear advantages to the cooperative approach to emergency care, it has not been widely adopted. To help provide other practi-tioners with an example of a successful emergency co- operative, the author will provide the details of practice experiences \u2014specically, (1) discuss the agreements, makeup, and context of the author 'sc o - operative; (2) consider the pitfalls and limitations of such groups; (3) provide examples of how the author 's group has handled potential contentious issues; and (4)nish with a broad look at the personal and profes- sional trade-offs that come with joining a cooperative. 2. The Author 's Emergency Cooperative Emergency cooperatives have been part of the author 's local practice culture for decades, so forma- tion of a cooperative was not a dif cult subject to broach with other area practitioners. Other groups had formed and dissolved for a variety of reasons, including refusal of practitioners to attend none- quine cases, practitioners not reliably being avail- able during their on-call rotations, and failure tofollow up with a client 's primary veterinarian. If t h ea u t h o rw e r et or e l o c a t et oan e wp r a c t i c ea r e a ,she would start with asking local colleagues if they would be interested in getting together once a month for case discussion. This would create alow-pressure environment to determine if the involved practitioners work well together and would make broaching the subject of forming a co- operative less of an obstacle. The author 'se m e r - gency cooperative, created in 2017, is made up ofve ambulatory solo practitioners. All of the practices are predominantly equine focused, but several practitioners also work with cattle, small ruminant, camelid, and porcine clientele. The co- operative covers an area that is up to 80 miles in diameter, but most clients are concentrated within 40 miles of all practices. The veterinary members meet monthly as a group. This pro- vides an opportunity for case discussion, address-ing any scheduling issues, and discussing any concerns about the function of the co- operative. Although the author 'sc o o p e r a t i v e was not formed around legal agreements, the setof rules and guidelines below were agreed upon to clarify expectations and improve communication: \u0081The clients 'primary practitioner is to be updated on cases seen at the end of each on-call period \u0081Clients of a cooperative member will not be charged a nonclient fee when seen on emergency \u0081Cooperative members will provide services toequine, caprine, ovine, bovine, porcine, andcamelid clients if they are current patients(generally de ned as clients seen for a regular appointment in the last year) \u0081People who have recently moved to the coverage area and do not have a veterinarian should beprovided service for emergencies, if possible \u0081All established clients, regardless of location,need to be provided service Each practitioner covers emergencies for all the members of the cooperative one day of the week, on a rotating schedule. Similarly, the weekends and holi-days are divided among the group members. The schedule is planned for 20 weeks in advance (each prac- titioner gets four weekends of emergency call in each planning period). When a cooperative member receives a request for emergency services from some-one who is not one of their clients, the caller is asked to identify their regular veterinary provider to determine if they are associated with the cooperative. Although there is the potential that clients may lie, this has not proven to be an issue. When clients that are not asso-ciated with the cooperative request emergency services, it is at the discretion of the on-call veterinarian if they are willing and able to provide services. After theservices are completed, all billing or payment is the responsibility of the veterinarian attending the call, w h ot h e np r o v i d e sa nu p d a t eo nt h ec a s et ot h er e g u l a r veterinarian via a phone call, text message, or e-mail of medical records. Access to the other practices 'records is not available. If a cooperative member wishes to provide emergency service to one of their own clients when they are not on call, this is allowed. 3. Limitations/Pitfalls In the 2020 AAEP Emergency Coverage Survey, only 8% of the over 800 practitioners polled utilized the coop- erative model for emergency coverage. Aside from larger practices not requiring such coverage, the top reasons cited for not joining a cooperative include thefollowing: \u0081Concern over the level of care provided by other veterinarians \u0081Covering too wide of a geographic area \u0081Concern over loss of clients to other practices \u0081Possible loss of revenue \u0081Concern over other practices 'fee structures \u0081Fear of unreceptive clients \u0081No offer to join a group has been extended \u0081Mixed animal practice would be required These are all legitimate concerns and challenges that were faced or considered in the author 's cooperative. However, all these issues can be addressed or at least mitigated. Below are the author 's experiences and approaches to each of these issues. One of the top concerns voiced in the 2020 AAEP survey was that the skill level of other veterinarians was not adequate to trustKEEPING EQUINE PRACTITIONERS IN EQUINE PRACTICE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 79with the care of one 's clients. Although the practice styles and strengths of each practitioner in different groups can vary, there has never been the concern that a colleague was not suited to provide adequateemergency care. Initially, this con dence was based only on the mutual respect one has for colleagues,but it has grown over time based on communicationafter emergencies and discussing cases and any con-cerns at monthly meetings. Bringing together mul-tiple practices has expanded the geographical areathat each member of the cooperative must coverwhen responsible for emergencies. While less thanideal, this is a trade-off that the author 's group has accepted. In return for occasional travel to furtherlocations (> 1 hour), nights and weekends are moreoften available. For some cooperatives, the areasthat require the furthest travel are generally under-served, and clients are happy a veterinarian is pro-viding service, regardless of wait time. However,some clients in far- flung areas with more opportuni- ties for equine veterinary care have been less accept-ing of longer wait times. While the clients 'desire for more immediate care is appreciated, it is notlikely to modify the practice 's cooperative arrange- ment to service these desires, content that quality24/7 care for all clients is provided. One concernthat members of the cooperative and many veterinar-ians have is the potential to lose clients to other prac-tices in the cooperative. It is a fact that clients maydesire to switch practices, and when this happens inthe cooperative setting, it can create feelings of dis-trust, underminine relationships and cause potentialfailure of the cooperative. To address this concern,clear communication with the clients and otherveterinarians must be identi ed to increase trust and reduce the probability of clients switchingpractices. A general philosophy has been adoptedthat clients are not owned by a practice and may switch practices if they choose, but maintaining the trust of the other veterinarians in the group (andthus the ongoing success of the group) is valuedabove procuring a new client. If a client choosesto switch, a conversation between the two veterinar-ians generally takes place to prevent anymisunderstanding. Face-to-face (currently outdoorswhile social distancing) monthly meetings are key tobuilding good-faith re-lationships. If a practitioneris actively trying to steal another veterinarian 'sc l i - ents by marketing to them, it would become increas-ingly uncomfortable to sit down and look thatcolleague in the eye every month. At the onset ofthe author 's cooperative, several veterinarians were worried about the potential loss of revenue frompassing emergency work to their colleagues. Thesemembers were willing to join the group if they hadthe option to continue to see their clients 'emergen- cies at any time. This alleviated concerns about the potential for lost revenue yet allowed them to utilize the opportunity for time off when needed. To date,no member has had any issue with loss of revenuefrom joining the cooperative. In fact, many nd theincreased call volume seen when on call increases ef-ciency and makes up for any revenue lost when passing calls to the co-operative. This ef ciency also makes it viable to pay an assistant to be avail-able during emergency coverage periods. Withoutthe cooperative, the 24/7 nature of being on callmakes it too costly to maintain a technician 's avail- ability in the event of an emergency, but with so fewshifts, it is very doable. Like many veterinarianssurveyed, some members have had concern over dif-fering fee structures. Speci cally, they were con- cerned that all members of the cooperative havesimilar emergency fees. This concern prompted thecreation of a \"no nonclient \"emergency fee rule when seeing clients that were established with a veterinarymember of the cooperative. It was also important tonot discuss the pricing of any speci c service as it is unethical and often illegal. Furthermore, in theauthor 's experience, unlike vaccines, castrations, and other similar services, clients are generally not price shopping emergency services. The members of the author 's cooperative have not experienced any feed- back from clients on differing fee structures. Withconcerns about client receptivity, the cooperativeaddressed the issue head on. A group seminar washeld for clients to promote the existence of the cooper-ative and give everyone a chance to meet the otherveterinarians and see their working relationship inaction. One member made a magnet with all of thepractice logos and phone numbers that could behanded out to clients. This gives an excellentopening for discussing the existence of the cooper-ative with new clients. Because there is often amisunderstanding among clients about whethert h ev e t sa l lw o r ki nt h es a m ep r a c t i c e ,t h em a g n e tmakes it clear that each practice is still an inde-pendent entity. Additionally, when providingemergency services, it should be made very clear with clients that their veterinarian will be updated in the morning and their care passedback into the hands of their regular provider.Working on nonequine species was a concern forseveral of the equine exclusive practitioners whenthey joined the group, but the bene ts of joining the group outweighed any discomfort of treatingthese species. To help familiarize these veterinar-ians with situations they may face, the cooperativeheld rounds on the most common emergencies seenin cattle and small ruminants. The veterinariansthat work regularly on these species have alsomade themselves available for phone consultswhen needed. In addition to the initiative to de-velop an emergency cooperative, and the trust,respect, and clear communication required to keepit functioning, flexibility has been key to longevity. The rotation schedule has changed toallow several members to take maternity leave, deal with family emergencies, and travel. In the last year, the weekday emergency coverage hasadapted to include daytime emergencies to help mem-ber parents deal with the unexpected increase in KEEPING EQUINE PRACTITIONERS IN EQUINE PRACTICE 80 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSchildcare requirements that have come with the COVID-19 pandemic. The practitioner assigned tothat evening 's call is ready to take on the other practi- tioners 'daytime emergencies with little notice. This has greatly reduced the stress that comes with unex- pected family emergencies (i.e., a sick child, school clo- sures, etc.). Emergency cooperatives have allowed t h ea u t h o rt od os o m e t h i n gt h a ti si n c r e a s i n g l yr a r e for solo practitioners \u2014to own a practice without it owning the practitioner. After having a child, theauthor is quite sure equine practice would nothave been possible without the support of the cooperative. If willing to make the trade-offs of occasional increased drive time, regularly entrust- ing patients 'care to a colleague, and perhaps working on occasional nonequine species, emer-gency cooperatives can be an excellent way to maintain the small general equine practice as a sustainable practice model. One will gain not only greater freedom with personal time but alsostronger relationships with colleagues.Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of Veterinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Introduction T h ee q u i n ev e t e r i n a r yi n d u s t r ys h o w sas t e a d y decline in veterinarians entering the profession, withless than 2% of graduates entering private equine practice since 2014 (Fig. 1). Retaining these new graduates is dif cult, with approximately 50% discon- tinuing their AAEP membership presumablyleaving equine practice within the rstve years post-graduation. 2AAEP membership has been declining over the last several years (Fig 2 adaptedfrom AAEP Annual Reports3). The reduction in numbers is likely multifactorial: practice owners areretiring, and fewer new graduates are entering equinepositions or they are leaving equine positions in pur-suit of small animal jobs. To attract new professio-nals, business owners should take a new approach toan aged business model. An overview of the currentbusiness model 's perceived shortfalls and an introduc- tion to alternative work schedules and practice roleswill offer solutions providing practice owners a moresustainable future.2. Discussion Employee Pain Points A May 2019 survey administered by Dr. Amy Grice and published in AAEP 2020 Convention Proceedingssummarized the key reasons why veterinarianschoose to leave (or consider leaving) equine practice(Fig. 3). On-Call/Emergency Duty In the 2016 AVMA AAEP Economic Impact Study, most equine veterinarians surveyed were responsiblefor more than 25% of emergency coverage at theirplace of employment (Fig. 4). A staggering 25% werethe sole providers of emergency coverage. This fact isnot surprising considering that approximately 38% ofAAEP members designate themselves as soleproprietors. 3Comparable data in the small animal sector is not available since the AVMA excludedemergency coverage questions from non-equinerespondents. However, companion animal emergency NOTES 82 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSKEEPING EQUINE PRACTITIONERS IN EQUINE PRACTICEcenters are common in populated areas around the country. Physical Demands/Dangers In a study published in 2018, 80% of equine veterinar- ians working in the United Kingdom reported work- related injuries (in their career to date), with over 40% leading to loss of work.4 Debt to Income Disparity The mean educational debt of students graduating from U.S. veterinary schools in 2019 was $183,302.5Although this number is an average for all students, including those with no student loan debt, an income disparity quickly develops. It takes equine veterinarians approximately ten additional years of practice, compared to their small animal colleagues, to earn a mean salary of $120,000 (Fig.5). Substantial debt coupled with lower lifetime earnings may exclude associate veterinarians fromthe ability to purchase a home, buy a practice, or feel they can meet the demands of their desired lifestyle. Long Hours/Culture Work Ethic The economic realities often lead equine veterinarians to work longer hours to earn additional income. 6This reality leads to a culture of new veterinarians associ- ating their worth with how many hours they work orwhat sacri ces they are willing to make in their perso- nal life. A practice culture that values hours of careover establishing healthy boundaries can become toxic and lead to burnout, medical mistakes, and physical injuries. Owner Pain Points The concerns of associates described above are also relevant to practice owners who must consider their succession plan, ability to hire associate veterinar-ians, and nancing for retirement. Fig. 1. Percentage of new graduates entering private equine practice.1 Fig. 2. Trends in AAEP membership among veterinarians and students.KEEPING EQUINE PRACTITIONERS IN EQUINE PRACTICE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 83Succession/ Retirement Plan Figure 5 also demonstrates the income disparity between retirement-aged equine veterinarians andtheir small animal colleagues. While the sale of a practice may be desired, newer graduates may not be positioned to purchase due to high educational debtburden (Fig. 6). As a result, older practice ownersmay face the need to continue working to meet their nancial obligations.Physical Pain or Fatigue/ Inability to Ease Up with Increasing Age Financial obligations and patient care do not decrease despite the onset of usual limitations of an agingbody. Finances of Hiring Additional Employees Many practitioners are unsure they have enough busi- ness to support an additional employee and may notknow how to assess their nances to make this Fig. 3. Survey responses summarizing why practitioners leave (or consider leaving) equine practice.2 Fig. 4. Percentage of on-call performed by veterinarians at their place of employment.1KEEPING EQUINE PRACTITIONERS IN EQUINE PRACTICE 84 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSdecision. Inevitably, the owner should expect to transfer a portion of their revenue to a new associate,as they are introduced to clients and integrated into the practice. Owners should also expect associates to produce less revenue than themselves initially (Fig. 7). Limited Hiring Pool In early 2021, there were 396 postings on AAEP 'sc a - reer center. An increase in job listings equates to added time for an actively searching practice owner to hire an associate. To summarize, the challenges faced by equine practitioners include a desire for thework to be less physically and temporally demanding while being more nancially viable. 3. Solution Consider the following options to address the general concerns that equine veterinary medicine faces. Charge Fees That Will Support Higher Salaries Without proper veterinary charges, practice ownerswill not have the funds to implement the suggested solutions. Associate veterinarians will have minimal incentive to work harder when they are not adequately compensated for their time. Practiceowners should commit to reviewing their nances compared to industry benchmarks 7and their pricing strategies.8A focus on increased pro tability9will make the following suggestions more obtainable. Alternative Work Schedules Part-Time Associates Ten percent of respondents in the 2019 survey by Grice credited the inability to work part-time as areason for leaving or considering leaving equine medicine. Hiring one or more part-time employees has several bene ts: \u0081The practice can spread emergency coverage among multiple employees (Fig. 8). \u0081Part-time employees require fewer bene ts. \u0081Higher utilization of resources when shared on alternating days (e.g., one work truck with all the supplies needed to be shared between mul-tiple associates who are each scheduled 2 -3 days a week instead of the typical 5 -6). \u0081Greater flexibility and work-life balance. Shared Emergency Coverage or Emergency Associate Prior convention proceedings provide examples for establishing a shared emergency call schedule among neighboring practices. 10This allows emergency res- ponders to be spread between many individuals withno additional nancial burden and minimal time organizing and acclimating clients to new coverage protocols. If shared coverage is not possible in a particular area due to poor relationships amongcolleagues or lack of other equine practices, another solution is hiring a strictly emergency duty associate. Although this may seem logisti-cally impossible, emergency-only after-hours practices have been prevalent in the small animal world for years. The author saw this modelused in a local referral practice and noted that it was well-received by competing clinics because practice owners saw the emergency doctor as an emergency-only resource and not a day-time competitor. Practices looking for strictly Fig. 5. Mean annual income re flecting the number of years since DVM graduation.1KEEPING EQUINE PRACTITIONERS IN EQUINE PRACTICE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 85emergency coverage could also fund a veterinar- ian to provide emergency coverage across multipleclinics. Seasonal Hires/Relief Veterinarians There are currently 61 veterinarians across the United States listed as relief veterinarians on AAEP 's Touch Relief Veterinarian Network. 11Whether a practice owner needs to go on vacation, an employee is out for illness or maternity leave, or it is during abusier season, relief veterinarians are a temporary so-lution for transient demands in doctor time. Using Licensed Technicians and Support Staff Hiring another veterinarian may not be feasible for a veterinary practice, but the addition of a support staffemployee may be an option. Team members helpaddress several of the primary concerns highlightedabove: time ef ciency, revenue opportunities, safety, desire to work part-time, etc. The 2016 AVMA AAEP Economic Survey found that hiring additional employees (vet or support staff) led to a negligible orpositive nancial impact in mean veterinary income (Fig. 9). Moving from one staff member to two tofour staff members led to a $125 reduction in an-nual salary. When moving beyond two to fourtotal employees, the mean veterinary salaries were positively impacted ($5,500 -38,000 increase). For a solo practitioner, hiring an employee results in a minimal loss of income which is a reasonabletrade for increased assistance, safety, and efciency. Scaling in a large practice size creates higher salaries for veterinary staff. Although the Fig. 6. Mean debt-to-income ratio of AVMA equine veterinarians and all AVMA veterinarians by graduation year.1KEEPING EQUINE PRACTITIONERS IN EQUINE PRACTICE 86 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSFig. 7.

Veterinary income related to practice size.1KEEPING EQUINE PRACTITIONERS IN EQUINE PRACTICE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 87cited report did not assess the impact of practice size on revenue or pro tability of the veterinary practice at large, one might presume that revenueswill be higher as a re flection of increased salaries. There will also be intangible bene ts (work-life balance, team culture, emotional sup-port, perceived safety) that exist from increasedassistance. There are currently 800 registeredAAEVT members available to ll these roles and support the above efforts. For practices that al-ready have support staff on their payroll, room forincreased utilization of these employees exists.Figure 10 demonstrates everyday tasks performedby licensed and unlicensed technicians and the per-centage of practices assigning these responsibil-ities to their support team.Develop a Succession Plan Approximately 40% of equine practitioners are over 50 years of age.1These practitioners may not be prepared to retire despite the desire. Forming a relationship with a younger practitioner and developing a succession plan offers an opportu- nity to mentor while providing nancial stability through a transition period. The succession planmay look different for every practice. Critical points should include the mentee/mentor rela- tionship, employment period for a successfultransition of clients, and proceeds from associateownership percentage applying to the total pur- chase price. Dr. Ann Dwyer brie flyr e v i e w e dt h e basics of practice ownership and acquisition in the AAEP Convention Proceedings from 2009. Fig. 10. Common practice responsibilities and percentage performed by support staff.1KEEPING EQUINE PRACTITIONERS IN EQUINE PRACTICE 88 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSOwners and new graduates/associates would ben- et from reviewing these guidelines.12 4. Example of Paradigm Change My desire to build an equine practice that supportedmy lifestyle without becoming my life led to severalshifts from the standard business model. Whilepracticing as a solo veterinarian, I established ashared on-call schedule with a fellow practiceowner. A registered veterinary technician (RVT)was hired to provide support during patient visits andadminister solo appointments (bandage changes, lasertherapy, injections, etc.). The bene to fh a v i n gt h e RVT perform patient care included an afternoon off oran opportunity to see extra practice-buildingcases. Clients also accepted the idea of having othercare providers besides the practice owner. The RVTsincreased duties made a smooth transition for the rst associate that was hired. The rst associate, similar to 10% in the survey shared above, desired a part-time position. Her employment increased practice hours of availability, helped reduce owner on-call duties, and did not require the purchase of a new vehi-cle or additional equipment. Throughout the addi-tion of new associates, a relationship was maintainedwith the solo practitioner who shared on-call. Itbecame a natural progression to integrate both prac-tices in a manner that offered excellent client carethrough the transition, increased caseload and addi-tional mentorship for newer associates, and a path toretirement on the solo owner' s terms. There is still more to do, but the alternative scheduling, valuedpartnerships with solo practitioners, and shifting em-ployee duties have been bene cial for both associate and practice health. 5. Conclusion As a solo practitioner \u2014ask yourself: Do I have a suc- cession plan or am I making a nancial retirement plan that will not rely on selling my practice? If not, isthere a newer graduate you can take on as a mentee?In practices with associates, consider the expectationsand scheduling parameters you place on yourveterinarians. Examine your support staff roles andwhether employees are \"working to the top of their skill set. \"Small changes can have a notable impact onemployee satisfaction, retainment, and the business bottom line.

Results and Discussion All 20 horses remained healthy during the entire study period. At study commencement, the seropre- valence to S. neurona ,d ened as the percentage of horses in each group with a titer 40, was 70% and 80% in the control and treatment group,respectively. The initial seroprevalence de- creased initially in the treatment group to 50% at 30 days post-treatment commencement, while theseroprevalence in the control group increased to90%. This was followed by a slow increase in seroprevalence in the treatment group beforereaching 100% in both groups by 90 days post-treatment commencement. The seroprevalence remained 100% in both groups from 90 to 360 study days. While titer distribution between thetwo groups was similar at study commencement,treated horses displayed signi cantly lower titers throughout the treatment period (P <0.05). All treated study horses had detectable plasmatrough diclazuril levels at the six time points, andthe levels were above the concentration known to inhibit S. neurona in vitro (1 ng/mL).

Introduction Colic has been previously associated with shedding of Salmonella . The purpose of this study was to deter- mine the prevalence of Salmonella shedding in a colic population and identify factors associated withSalmonella shedding. 2. Materials and Methods This was a retrospective case-control study. Foreach colic horse that was positive for Salmonella (n = 56), two colic cases (n = 112) that tested negativewere enrolled as controls. Associations betweenvariables and Salmonella shedding were identi ed using logistic regression. Univariate and multivari-ate models were developed pertaining to 1) presentingclinicopathological data and 2) clinical variables thatdeveloped during hospitalization. 3. Results Of 1,917 horses presenting with colic, 1,585 had atleast 1 sample submitted for Salmonella testing. Of these, 56 were positive for Salmonella yielding a prev- alence of 3.5%. Horses shedding Salmonella were more likely to present with a history of fever(p= 0.01), increased lactate ( p= 0.007) and/or Research Abstract \u2014for more information, contact the corresponding author NOTES 92 2021 / Vol. 67 / SIDE EFFECTSneutropenia ( p= 0.02). Hospitalized horses shedding Salmonella were more likely to be febrile ( p=0 . 0 1 ) and 10 times more likely to develop re flux (p=0 . 0 1 ) compared to controls. 4. Discussion T h ep r e v a l e n c eo f Salmonella shedding in this colic population was low, presumably due to increased bio- security measures. More Salmonella positive horses developed refl ux versus diarrhea while in the hospital. These ndings may warrant revision of relying on diarrhea as one of the primary signs ofinfection and revising the criteria for infectious dis-ease control protocols.

Materials and Methods Medical records from horses with positive bacterialcultures from corneal ulcers treated at the Universityof Tennessee between March 2011 and December2020 were compared to previously published datafrom January 1993 through May 2004. Dataincluding bacteria isolated, history, cytology results,susceptibilities to selected antimicrobials, and caseoutcomes were collected. 3. Results Thirty-one bacterial isolates were cultured from 27samples (26 horses). The most common bacterialgenera were Streptococcus (35%), (29%), and Pseudomonas (13%). costeroids prior to culture was signi cantly associated with Staphylococcus infections (p = 0.04). Compared to the earlier study period, there was a signi cant number of Streptococcus isolates reported with reduced sensitivity to gentamicin (p = 0.01) in the cur-rent data.

Gentamicin is a widely used antimicrobial in equine medicine for the treatment of Gram-negative in-fections. Gentamicin toxicity has included renal andototoxic effects. Ototoxicity has been suspected in thehorse, but such association has not been investigated atcurrently routine dosages. Therefore, the objective ofthis study was to investigate auditory and vestibularfunction in healthy adult horses administeredgentamicin. 2. Materials and Methods Ten healthy young adult horses were included in thestudy. Gentamicin sulfate was administered at6.6 mg/kg in the jugular alternating sides for 7consecutive days. Vestibular and auditory functionwere evaluated through neurological examination andbrainstem auditory evoked responses (BAER), re-spectively. Horses were sedated with IV detomidine hydrochloride to perform BAER studies. A BAER was done at the beginning of the study (day 1: base-line), at the end of the study (day 7), and 30 days after(day 37). Bone conduction was performed to rule outa conduction disorder. 3. Results Seven horses developed auditory loss: complete bilateral(N= 1), complete unilateral (N = 2), and partial unilateral (N= 4). Absent bone conduction ruled out a conduction disorder and further supported sensorineural auditoryloss in horses. Dysfunction was reversible in 4 of 7horses. Vestibular dysfunction was not observed. 4. Discussion Gentamicin might pose a risk for the development ofauditory loss in horses, which might be irreversible.

Materials and Methods Forty-six Thoroughbred yearlings underwent endo-scopic examination of the larynx before (group 1) andafter butorphanol were measured from images capturedfrom a video recording at the point of maximal abductionof the arytenoid cartilages. Recordings were reviewedby three clinicians to assess agreements of the grade of la-ryngeal function, using the 7-grade Havemeyer endo-scopic The and CSARG of didnot differ that group-2 yearlings. The mean intraobserver agreement ofgrade of laryngeal function of yearlings in group 1was 93.1%, with a mean kappa statistic of 0.86. Themean intraobserver agreement of grade of laryngealfunction of group-2 yearlings was 92.9%, with a meankappa statistic of 0.88. The mean interobserveragreement of grade of laryngeal function of group-1yearlings was 92.8%, with a mean kappa statistic of0.84. The mean interobserver agreement of grade oflaryngeal function of group-2 yearlings was 92.7%,with a mean kappa statistic of 0.87. The correlationbetween CSARG and grade of laryngeal function wassignicant for both groups (P <.0 0 1 ) . A l l t h r e e observers assigned the same grade of laryngeal func-tion to 35 of 45 (77.8%) of the yearlings in group 1 and Research Abstract \u2014for more information, contact the corresponding author NOTES 98 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSMEDICINE I: THERAPEUTICS - SAFETY AND SIDE EFFECTS33 of 45 (73.3%) of the yearlings in group 2. One video recording of a yearling was determined, bytwo of the observers, to be too brief to assign a grade of laryngeal function, which was excluded for statistical analysis. The median grade of la-ryngeal function in group 1 was II.1 and I ingroup-2 yearlings. 4. Conclusion and Clinical Significance Administering butorphanol and detomidine toThoroughbred yearlings, before examining the upperrespiratory tract endoscopically, with the horses atrest, does not signi cantly affect the grade oflaryngeal function. To provide a clinical scenario, anose twitch was applied to all yearlings in group 1,which may have affected laryngeal movements.

(CBD) is widely marketed to reduce anxi- ety and pain, but limited safety, ef cacy, or pharmaco- kinetic data is available in horses. The objectives ofthis study were to determine (1) plasma pharmacoki- netics, (2) short-term safety, and (3) synovial fluid lev- els of CBD following oral administration. 2. Materials and Methods Two groups of 6 horses were administered sunfl ower lecithin oil-based CBD at 1 mg/kg (group mg/kg (group 2) for a 24-hour pharmacokinetic study. Allhorses then received 0.5 mg/kg or 1.5 mg/kg q12hPO for 6 weeks with steady state and eliminationsampling performed up to 96 hours post nal dose. Synovial fluid concentrations were eval- uated at 12 and 24 hours and 5 weeks. Horseswere monitored daily, and clinicopathologic pa-rameters were 19.9 615.6 ng/mL and 5.063.7 hours for groups 1 and 2, respectively. Following the nal dose at 6 weeks, one group-2 horse still had detectable plasma levels at 96 hours. CBDwas detectable in synovial fluid in 8 horses during steady state. Mild hypocalcemia was seen in all horses, andelevated liver enzymes were observed in 8 horses, butthese changes decreased or normalized 10 days after thenal CBD dose. 4. Discussion CBD has dose-dependent, but variable, oral bioavaila-bility at 1 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg daily dosing. CBD isdetectable at steady state in synovial fluid at the higher dose. Further investigation is needed to es-tablish clinically effective doses.

A lot of information can be obtained from vis- ual analysis of lame horses under standardized situations combining different gaits, ground surfaces and exercises. These data are not only useful for diagnostic purposes but are key to evaluating the signicance of imaging ndings and to establish an adequate rehabilitation program avoiding uncom- fortable situations for the horse. In practice, analysis of video-recordings (at normal speed or slow motion) is recommended to con rm, complete, or extend analysis of clinical manifestations. More sophisticated methods have been used or are in development to give further objective data especiallyat the trot, but as the vast majority of functionally normal horses present gait asymmetries, thereis a need for establishing the criteria to discriminate between physiological lateralization diagnosis of lameness has been considered for a long time in many textbooks and papers, and symp-toms as well as causes of musculoskeletal injurieshave been extensively discussed and debated. 1-11 Evaluation of the horse at the trot combined withdiagnostic analgesia has been widely used, investi-gated, and recommended and is generally consideredas the gold standard approach for establishing the ori-gin of pain. 12-14 Nowadays, the extraordinary development of imag- ing techniques and technologies has permitted the di-agnosis and documentation of an unlimited number ofcauses of lameness. Constant improvement andincreased availability of these techniques for eld practice have enabled the practitioner to reach a moreprecise identi cation and documentation of lesions and abnormalities with the conviction or the hope fora better management of the affected horse. The drawback of having access to a variety of moresensitive techniques is the risk of overinterpretingimaging ndings and overestimating their signi - cance; it is also to bypass the essential step that con-sists of establishing the correlation between the clinical presentation and the lesion(s). The purpose of the pre-sentation is to demonstrate how a horse alters its gait to decrease the pain induced by each type of condition. The basic concept presented inthis paper is that gait alterations (lameness) are a live expression and the re flection of functional anatomy and biomechanics, as the horse changes its gaits to reduce the biomechanical stresses on painful anatomi-cal structure(s). Typical alterations of the gait pat-tern at the walk, trot, and canter evaluated indifferent situations and exercises are presented inthis paper to show how lame horses illustrate the dis-tribution of biomechanical stresses on musculoskel- etal lesions and to demonstrate that, from a diagnostic point of view, the type of lameness is morei m p o r t a n tt h a nt h eg r a d e . T h ef o r m a to ft h i sp a p e rconsists of following each step of the dynamic NOTES 106 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSFRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREexamination and to analyze gait and movement alter- ations of different types of lameness in the light offunctional anatomy and biomechanics. A number ofstudies have been done to compensate the limitationsof the subjective evaluation of lameness. 15-40 Nevertheless, an interesting debate arose a few yearsago about the use of quantitative gait analysis andthe signi cance of the objective technological data obtained. 41-46Another objective of this paper is to demonstrate that there is still room for a visualassessment of gait abnormalities in horses, from aglobal point of view to more detailed considerations onspecic aspects of the equine locomotion and joint movements. This is especially crucial for intermit-tent manifestations, such as those induced by someneurological problems (see below). Whatever theobjective or subjective data given by an external anal-ysis of the horse locomotion, the most important is theclinical reasoning for analyzing the internal causes ofthe manifestations observed. Lameness or Laterality? In most cases, lameness is a clinical expression of pain, with the horse redistributing the load between limbs (kinetic aspect) and this results in asymmetricalgaits or movements (kinematic aspect). However, is asymmetry a lameness?47-49Having examined sound and lame horses for more than 30 years, live and sub- sequently on video recordings, I still don 'tk n o ww h a t a sound horse is. I have read numerous textbooksand an endless number of papers on different types and grades of lameness based on the severity of asym- metrical load distribution or manifestations, but I canhardly identify a physically and functionally symmet-rical horse. Most of (if not all) the horses show some degree of asymmetry when examined at different gaits or at work. Asymmetry at the walk or at thetrot is common and can be objectivated using gaitanalysis systems. Is it possible to discriminate a lowgrade of lameness from asymmetry in horses? Contrary to the majority of lameness, asymmetry is not pain related. Asymmetry is not improved withrest, it does not worsen with the level of exercise orwhen the athletic demand increases; it can be compat-ible with adequate performance and it sometimes improves with exercise. 44-45Therefore, recognition o fa s y m m e t r yv e r s u sl a m e n e s si se a s i e rw h e nd o i n g longitudinal rechecks of horses over prolonged periods(up to several years). Clinically, there is no change af- ter performing adequate diagnostic analgesia (although this procedure is not entirely sensitive as completeblocking of proximal regions is not possible). But func-tional (and physical) asymmetry needs to be identi ed as it can predispose to secondary problems such as tendon disease on the limb carrying more weight. Differentiation between lameness andasymmetry or laterality is especially crucial whenperforming a single examination such as in a pre- purchase examination. It is sometimes dif cult to conclude in this context and reexamination ofthe horse at its intended level of use is indicated to reinforce the decision. Origins of physical and func- tional asymmetry include the consequences of develop-mental conditions, sequelae of old trauma, and morphofunctional asymmetry of the nervous system command and control. Laterality in horses has beenrelated to morphological, behavioral, occupational, neu- rological, or gender factors. 49-51Depending on the ori- gin of the lameness, a differential diagnosis has sometimes been suggested to distinguish pain manifes-tations from mechanical lameness and neurological problems. However, in many horses two of these com- ponents are combined and are integrated in the diag-nostic approach. Musculoskeletal lameness and neurological conditions are sometimes considered as separate conditions and inter-observer agreement ofneurological manifestations is poor. 52-54But, induce pathological andfunctional alterations of the corresponding spinal nerves (or segments) and clinical manifestations are a mixture of osteoarticular and neurological symptoms. 55 Basic Aspects and Terminology Used in This Paper9,56,57 During a complete stride, each limb achieves a stance(weight bearing) phase and a swing (non-weight bear-ing, pendular) phase. The stance phase can be bro- ken down into three parts: (a) the cranial part or load absorption phase, starting after landing; (b) an inter-mediate or mid-stance phase with full weight bearing on the limb; and (c) a caudal or propulsion phase end- ing with the break over (from heel off to toe off). Theswing phase can be divided in a pulling phase (the limb being pulled forward) especially demanding at high speed, a mid-swing phase where maximal flexion angles take place, and a protraction phase ending atlanding. From a clinical point of view, it is essential to analyze the chain of events happening during the cranial and caudal parts of the stride. The cranialphase (or part) of the stride is the part of angular dis- placement of the limb cranially to a vertical line dropped from the center of motion of the limb (Fig.1). This line is easily drawn on the hindlimb from the coxofemoral joint. On the forelimb, the scapula is linked to the thorax with muscles (synsarcosis) andslides over the thoracic wall. As a result, this line moves cranio-caudally and, as a practical approach, t h es p i n eo ft h es c a p u l aa tt h em i d d l eo ft h i sb o n ec a nbe chosen to intersect with it. The cranial part of thestride begins with the protraction phase that ends at landing and continues with a load absorption phase up to mid-stance phase. During the caudal phase (orpart) of the stride, the limb moves caudally to the ver- tical line, rst during the caudal part of the stance phase when the limb is displaced caudally up to break over and then during the caudal part of the swing phase (pulling phase) when the limb is displaced cra- nially up to the mid-swing position. According to thetiming of clinical manifestations, different types oflameness have been identi ed with some variations between authors. 2,4,9,10,57 -61FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTURE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 107Stance phase lameness conditions (or supporting limb or weight bearing lameness) are the most com- mon ones and have been widely presented anddiscussed. The horse uses the inertia of its bodymass to increase deceleration, bear more weight, andachieve greater propulsion from the sounderlimb. 62On the lame limb, the horse reduces shockabsorption (shock absorption lameness: decreased cra-nial phase of the stride), decreases load (mid-stance orweight bearing lameness), and/or reduces propulsion(propulsion lameness or push off lameness). Swing phase lameness conditions (swinging limb lameness) are often underestimated. They show upduring the pulling forward part (e.g., shoulder syn-drome including scapulohumeral arthropathies andbicipital apparatus injuries), carpi radialis), and pro- traction (e.g., reduced protraction: shoulder syndrome, nerve and muscle paresis; increased swing of protrac-tion: de cit of the digital flexor muscles). Mixed lameness conditions are common. Even if the clearest manifestations happen during either thestance or the swing phases, many single causes oflameness may alter both (from prodotrochlear syn-drome to shoulder problems; Fig. 2). The primary or baseline lameness 9-10is not always the most obvious and the primary cause of a lot offlexor tendon or suspensory apparatus injuries must be searched for an adequate management of thehorse. Secondary lameness is also called complementary or compensatory lameness. 63-64Pain in one limb indu- ces redistribution of the load on the other limbs.62-65 As a typical example, a super cial digital flexor (SDF) tendon injury on a forelimb can be the consequence ofpain on the opposite forelimb or the opposite hind-limb. 9,66,67But, considering load redistribution between Fig. 1.

MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTURE 108 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSforelimbs and hindlimbs, compensatory lameness should not be confused with secondary lameness dueto asymmetry. This paper focuses on qualitative data. When mentioned, the severity of the lameness is expressed using the AAEP grading scale, althoughthis scale is mainly based on stance phase alterationsand other grading systems have been used. 59,68,69For more clarity, the gait characteristics of the lame orlamest limb (referred to as the 'lame limb ')a r e considered. In multiple limb lameness, the combina-tion of single limb characteristics may vary extensively depending on the number of sites of pain or mechani- cal defects. Flexion tests and diagnostic analgesiaare not considered in this paper. Horse managementduring examination in hand, on the lunge, or whenthe horse is ridden or driven is important for bothhorse and human safety but is beyond the scope of thepaper. 2. Hard (or Firm) Surface Examination at the Walk A common limitation of the clinical assessment of lameness is to restrict the examination at the trot and to rapidly move on to diagnostic analgesia.Examination at the walk can provide valuable informa-tion and is easily accessible as the movements are slow(pedagogical/didactic value). Besides, in very painfulhorses, this should be the only situation used to evalu- ate the lameness. As the walk is a slow gait with no suspension phase, there is less load impact and lessmaximum load at mid-stance phase, but there is anincreased stance phase duration. 70Therefore, the clin- ical manifestations of a horse at the walk are morerelated to movement (kinematics) than to forces(kinetics). Straight Line Examination of the horse at the walk on a straight line on a hard and horizontal surface is probably the best situation to analyze the limb conformation, fet-lock support, and foot landing. Looking at the horsefrom the front, with the horse coming toward the observer, is more reliable than the standing exami- nation for assessment of limb conformation such asvarus/valgus deformities of the carpus and fetlock. The cranial view is also useful for assess- ment of the foot landing and balance. Even moder-ate, angular deformities have direct consequences on the load distribution within the joints and their identi cation is an essential contribution to the management and even the prevention of associated or secondary injuries. Besides, as alternate muscle contraction highlights left to right asymmetry, iden-tication of myopenia (muscle atrophy) is easier and more reliable at the walk than during the staticexamination, especially on the hindlimbs. Forelimbs. Stance phase (weight bearing) lameness conditions. To reduce the load absorption and maxi- mum load on the affected limb, horses with very pain- ful forelimb lameness demonstrate wide head oscillations (with higher velocity of the head dropping on the sounder limb) and decreased protraction dur-ing the swing phase (Fig. 3). Therefore, the affected limb shows a decreased fetlock extension during the stance phase and an increased fetlock extension onthe sounder limb is observed. A hindlimb interfer- ence can be seen with increased protraction of the op- posite hindlimb in an attempt to reduce the load onthe affected forelimb. Horses with severe pain of the suspensory apparatus (e.g., proximal sesamoid bone fracture; Fig. 3) present a reduction of the cranialphase and an extended caudal phase of the stride. This is correlated to biomechanical data showing a higher tension of the suspensory apparatusand SDF tendon during the r s tp a r to ft h es t a n c e phase at the walk (Fig. 4). 71-73Several studies show that at the walk the peak of load on the deep digitalflexor (DDF) apparatus (DDF tendon and takes place at theend of the stance phase. 71,72This explains why horses with severe pain in the DDF apparatus or in the podotrochlear apparatus (navicular syndrome) show a reduction of the caudal phase of the stride and Fig. 3. Five-year-old Standardbred trotter male presenting a fracture at the base of the medial proximal sesamoid bone on the left forelimb. The cranial phase of this limb is dramatically shortened, and the caudal phase is extended. Extension of the left frontfetlock is severely reduced, and protraction of the right hind limb is anticipated and exaggerated to reduce the load on the left fore- limb (look at the distance between diagonals).FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTURE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 109a wider cranial phase (Fig. 5). The same manifesta- tions can be seen with injuries of the DDF tendon in contact with a radial osteochondroma or a fracture ofthe olecranon providing attachment to the ulnar head of the muscle. 58A foot abscess at the dorsal as- pect of the sole may also induce shortening of the cau- dal phase of the stride as pressure increases over the toe area at the end of the stance phase.74A decrease in fetlock suspension on the lame limb may be present in cases of failure of the suspensory apparatus or SDFtendon rupture or elongation. But because of the limited load during the stance phase at the walk,most of the horses with suspensory apparatus desmo- pathies suspensory ligament desmopa-thies/enthesopathies are at this gait.In some horses, the reduction of fetlock extension maybe the only dynamic manifestation of suspensory dis- ease at the walk (Fig. 6). Extension of the distal in- terphalangeal joint at the end of the stance phasewith sudden elevation of the toe is pathognomonic ofDDF tendon elongation or rupture. Shoulder insta-bility is often clearer at slow gaits compared to fastergaits. Suprascapular nerve paralysis (sweeney syn-drome) typically induces a varus of the shoulderjoint worse at the end of the stance phase. Indeed,the lateral stability is no longer achieved by the infra-spinatus muscle body eccentric and isometriccontractions. This manifestation is accompanied bya reduction of the forelimb protraction (cranial part ofthe swing phase) as a result of a combined paresis orparalysis of the supraspinatus muscle making itunable to extend the shoulder joint during the swingphase. Swing phase lamenesses. Two typical examples of swing phase lameness can be observed in clinicalcases. Some young horses with lesions of theshoulder joint (osteochondrosis, osteochondrodyspla- sia, fracture of the tuberculum supraglenoidalis) show a marked decrease of protraction, wide head oscilla-tions with a higher velocity during elevation of thehead, synchronous of protraction of the affectedlimb. Pain during the swing phase is caused by theconcentric contraction of the supraspinatus muscleextending the shoulder joint as a Type 1 lever arm;the pressure over the articular surfaces of the hum-eral head and glenoid cavity of the scapula are there-fore increased (Fig. 7). This lameness also has astance phase component characterized by lowering ofthe head on the sounder limb, reduced fetlock Fig. 5. Five-year-old Standardbred trotter female presenting a fracture of the lateral palmar process of the distal phalanx on the right forelimb. There is a reduction of weight on theaffected limb with a marked reduction of fetlock extension (image B). There is also a shortening of the caudal phase of the stride as distal interphalangeal joint extension puts stress onthe deep digital flexor tendon partly inserted on the fracture. Fig. 6.

C, Caudal part of the stance phase: The distal interphalangeal joint (DIPJ) extension induces the highest tension of the deep digital flexor (DDF) ap- paratus (DDF tendon and its accessory ligament); the elevation of the fetlock reduces the tension on the suspensory apparatus, but active super cial digital flexor (SDF) muscle contraction still puts stress on corresponding tendon.

Inmost of these secondary neurological cases (with pri-mary cervical arthropathies), there is less alterationof both head movements and fetlock suspension andreduction of the cranial phase of the stride is lessvisible at faster gaits. Developmental or acquiredarthropathies of and are partof what can be called the equine cervicothoracobra-chial (CTB) syndrome (Figs. 8 -10). 55This syndrome overlaps what is described in human medicine for a long time as the cervicobrachial syndrome and thethoracic outlet syndrome, although horses lack a clavi-cle. 75-77Other lesions causing the same typical dys- kinesia of protraction of the forelimb in horses includecaudal cervical intervertebral disc lesions, arthropa-thy of the rst costovertebral joint and congenital abnormalities of the rst rib such as agenesia, hypo- dystrophia, and synostosis with often incom-plete brous union of the rst two ribs. 78,79All these abnormalities or injuries are in close anatomical relation with the brachial plexuscomponents, either with its nerve roots (ventral ramiof C6 to T1 cervical spinal nerves at of theintervertebral foramen) or the brachial plexus and the scale- nus ventralis muscles and then crossing over and lying on the rst rib. Resulting alteration of the nerve conduction is responsible for paresis ofthe muscles achieving the protraction. They includethe supraspinatus muscle innervated by the supra-scapular nerve (coming from nerves C6and C7), the cleidobrachialis muscle innervated C7, of the radial nerve roots (C7, C8, and T1) or pathway may induce forelimb Fig. 7.

MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTURE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 111paresis (muscle weakness) further predisposing the horse to faulty steps, stumbling or even falling. These manifestations are often intermittent but because of the danger for the rider a specialattention should be given to the quality of forelimb protraction, which may be affected unilaterally or bilaterally. Swing phase lamenesses are rarely seen alone. With shoulder joint or bicipital apparatusinjuries, there is often a stance phase component ofthe pain when load is put on the affected limb. Forhorses presenting a CTB syndrome, there is often anelongated caudal part of the stride compensating theshortened cranial phase (Fig. 8). Hindlimbs. Weight bearing (stance phase) lame- nesses. Looking at the hind fetlock suspension dur- ing the stance phase at the walk is essential as a decrease in suspension can be compensated with acti-vation of the flexor muscles and tendons at faster gaits. The most common causes of this defect includedegenerative suspensory apparatus lesions and se-quela of juvenile tendon laxity. A unilateral or bilat-eral defect of fetlock suspension with a low pasternaxis is seen in degenerative suspensory disease (in any location between its proximal insertion and its branches). It must be noted that a horse that is lamebecause of pain at the origin of the suspensory liga-ment can present with a defect of fetlock suspensiondespite a load reduction on the affected limb. Theseclinical manifestations are the result of the functionalalteration created by the anatomopathological degen-eration of the suspensory apparatus. A decrease infetlock suspension can also be seen in horses present-ing with SDF tendonitis or laceration, or femur. Contrary tohorses dis-ease, horses with painful proximal suspensory enthe-sopathies show a decreased fetlock extension. Many other conditions can be responsible for the reduction of fetlock extension during the stance phase atthe walk. The differential diagnosis includes footabscesses, fetlock problems (Fig. 11), severe suspen-sory apparatus pain, severe distal tarsus pain, Fig. 9.

MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTURE 112 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSfemorotibial joint pain, stress fractures, and others. Most of hindlimb lameness conditions induce a reduc- tion of the cranial phase of the stride (clearer at the trot), but reduction of the caudal phase with lateral rotation of the limb can be seen in some conditionssuch as coxofemoral joint injuries (fracture of the ace- tabulum or of the femoral neck). This manifestation is correlated to the tension on the capitis and acces- sory ligaments of the hip joint that increases with medial rotation of the femur and decreases with lat- eral rotation. It is often associated with deviation of the pelvis and hind quarters, with the horse walkingsideways. Fractures of the tuber coxae (and some fractures of the tuber ischiadicum) may induce a reduction of the caudal phase of the stride. 82The ventral displacement of the affected tuber coxae indu-ces of the tensor fascia latae and a limi-tation to hip extension. Looking at the horse laterally at the walk is the best situation to assess the hindlimb sagittal conformation and identify the \"straight hock-low fetlock \"syndrome. Although this condition can be the result of congenital or juveniletendon laxity, it is often seen in horses presenting with progressive degenerative suspensory ligamentdisease. It is sometimes considered erroneously that horses with straight hocks are predisposed to suspen- sory disease. Biomechanically, the pathophysiology of this syndrome follows this sequence: a degenerative suspensory disease induces a fetlock suspensiondefect; hyperextension of the fetlock increases tension on the SDF tendon, which pulls the tuber calcanei cra- nially and induces secondarily hyperextension of the hock. Therefore, a straight hock conformation is not a predisposing factor to suspensory disease but is justthe result of an existing elongation of the suspensory ligament (Fig. 12). On the other hand, a defect of hock extension can be seen in horses presenting with a luxation of the SDF tendon from its normal position over the tuber calcanei. Twisted hock syndrome isbetter identi ed at the walk when the horse is exam- ined from the rear. This condition shows up during the caudal phase of the stride and has been seen in horses with femorotibial problems. A potential cause is an asymmetric radius of curvature of the medial and lateral femoral condyles, inducing a combination of lateral displacement and medial rotation of the tibia. This results in a varus of the hock at the end of the stance phase. The manifestation is oftenreduced at the trot or at faster gaits. A defect of hock extension combined with hyperextension of the sti fle and dorsal subluxation of the fetlock has been seen nerve paresis. Paresis of the gas- trocnemius muscle is responsible for hock extensiondefect and hyperextension of the sti fle, both inducing tension of the SDF tendon responsible for fetlockflexion. A defect of sti fle extension during the stance phase is typical of femoral nerve paralysis which indu-ces a paresis or paralysis of the quadriceps femoris muscle. This muscle becomes unable to achieve its eccentric contraction during the rst part of the stance phase and its concentric contraction to open the stifl e during the propulsion. 83Increased exten- sion of the sti fle may be secondary to osteochondrosis of the lateral trochlear ridge, with the horse displac- ing the patella proximally to avoid pressure on the lesion or to reduce patellar instability over a dysplas- tic femoral trochlea. Swing phase lamenesses. The typical example of a hindlimb swing phase lameness is the rupture of the peroneus tertius. The affected horse shows a patho- gnomonic lack of hock flexion despite a hyper flexion of the stifl e; there is no or little incidence on the stance phase. This mechanical lameness is induced by rup- ture or elongation of the peroneus tertius, making it no longer able to achieve the passive solidarizationbetween sti fleflexion and hock flexion during the swing phase. It must be added that as the hock nolonger flexes, the calcaneus lever arm does not act a n y m o r eo nt h eS D Ft e n d o nt oi n d u c e flexion of the fetlock joint which remains extended. Different con- ditions cause hyper flexion of the hindlimb joints in different parts of the swing phase. Hindlimb joint hyper flexion after breakover is seen in horses present- ing foot abscesses over the toe area. When pressureis concentrated on the dorsal part of the foot at the end of the stance phase, 74pain is responsible for sud- den active flexion and elevation of the foot arch at the beginning of the swing phase. In case of upward x- ation of the patella, a sudden spastic high velocity hyper flexion of the hindlimb can be seen during the rst part of the swing phase when the patella is removed from the tuberculum of the femoral trochlea after a sudden lateral rotation induced by contraction of the gluteofemoralis muscle.83Sudden reduction of protraction at the end of the swing phase with caudal retraction of the distal limb just before foot landing is typical of brotic myopathy of the semitendinosus muscle (Fig. 13). Other muscles such as the semi-membranosus and the gracilis muscles can be Fig. 12.

Before this event (May 3, 2019, left image) hock and fetlock joint angulation was within normal limits. For several weeks after the rupture,there was a dropping of the fetlock and hyperextension of the tarsus. After enough healing with extensive scar tissue (July 10, 2019), there was a reduction of fetlock and tarsus extension.FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTURE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 113affected with this condition and present similar manifestations. Although often considered as a me- chanical lameness, this typical gait can be seen inhorses without muscle brosis. Stringhalt is another swing phase lameness showing up at thewalk. 84Hyper flexion of all hindlimb joints during the swing phase and worse during the cranial part ofit, has been attributed to a lack of proprioceptiveadjustment and muscle coordination. This diseasehighlights the passive coordination between all thehindlimb joint angles which flex in unison (Fig. 14). 85 Mixed Lameness at the Walk. Horses affected with proximal or distal peroneus tertius enthesopathiesmay present a swing phase lameness and a weightbearing lameness. A lameness induced by a footabscess may present a stance phase and a swing phase component (see above). Neurological problems such as sciatic nerve paralysis or paresis can cause a lack of fetlock extension during the stance and swing phases. Alternating Circles on a Firm Surface Forelimbs. Horses reproduce on the circles the man- ifestations described on a straight line. Nevertheless, examination on alternating circles is essential as some- times this is the only or the most demonstrative situa- tion for detection of obvious to subtle changes of common conditions. As the limbs at the walk on a short circle combine a long stance phase duration with collateromotion and associated rotation, 86-90most of the horses affected with a podotrochlear syndrome (na-vicular disease) present with a reduction of the caudalphase of the stride (propulsion) when the lame limb is on the inside of the circle (Fig. 15). This typical gait alteration is induced by asymmetrical stresses on the podotrochlear apparatus (distal sesamoid bone, DDF tendon, and associated structures) as a of collat- eromotion and rotation. These extra-sagittal move- ments are higher on the distal limb on the inside of the circle which is more oblique than the outside limb over the examination surface. Moreover, they are exacerbated at the end of the stance phase (Fig. 16). 86Horses with bilateral podotrochlear syndrome demonstrate this reduction of the caudal phase of thestride on both turns in an alternate manner; this results in a shortened gait. The swing phase protrac- tion follows a longer pathway on the outside limb andreduction of protraction is sometimes clearer when the affected limb is outside of a short circle compared to the straight line (with the same causes: shoulder syndrome, CTB syndrome). On both the inside and outside limbs, special attention should be given to intermittent manifestations of carpus instability or of toe dragging as subtle manifestation of paresis. Hindlimbs. Examining the horse on alternating circles at the walk provides another opportunity to check for joint motion, fetlock suspension, and changes in the cranial or caudal phases of the stride. As described for the forelimbs, collateromotion and Fig. 13. Three-year-old Thoroughbred female presenting a brotic myopathy of the left semitendinosus muscle. There is a mechanical shortening of the protraction (engagement, cranialphase of the stride) ending in a typical vertical (or backward)landing of the foot (curved arrow). Fig. 14.

However, generally speak-ing, as there is less load on the hindlimbs, themanifestations of distal hindlimb in horses presenting with podotrochlear syn-drome in a hindlimb, reduction of the caudal phase ofthe stride on the turns is less clear than on fore-limbs. Nevertheless, pain can be exacerbated incase of injuries involving the distal and proximalinterphalangeal joints as well as the fetlock jointespecially when the proximal sesamoid bones are affected. The walk on alternating circles is one of the most informative situations to detect neuro-logical problems on the hindlimbs and especiallyataxia, paresis and dysmetria. A shortening ofthe hindlimb stride length accentuated on theturns may be seen in horses with lumbosacroiliacpain or dysfunction. 91-92 Axial regions. A normal horse at the walk on alter- nating circles demonstrates relaxation and alternat-ing latero flexion axial regions. In the latero flexion on one side is sponta- neously associated to rotation on the oppositeside. 93These combined movements induce shearing of the interspinal ligaments and spinous processmargins. Besides, the sacroiliac joint undergoes greater range of flexion-extension, latero flexion, and rotation at the walk than at the trot. 94Neck, thora- columbar, or pelvic pain may induce a short and stiff gait, a lack of lateral bending, and sometimes counter-incurvation (counter-bending).Examination at the Trot on a Firm Surface Trot on a Straight Line At the trot, the increased speed and the presence of a suspension phase increase the vertical and horizontal loading rate during the shock absorption phase and the vertical load at mid-stance compared to the walk (Fig. 17).60,95Therefore, stance phase lameness is exa- cerbated and increased activation of the musclegroups at faster gaits makes some swing phase mani- festations shade off. As the trot is an alternating symmetrical gait, most of the kinematic or kineticdevices developed to assess lameness use this gait as a reference. 17-36,96Gait analysis data have been compared with the visual clinical observation.20,34,38,40 Representation of the trajectories (vertical displace-ment over time) of the head, withers, and tuber sacrale versus time provides visual objective data ongait asymmetries (Fig. 18). These techniques have the potential to improve objective assessment of diag- nostic analgesic techniques or rider technique and tohelp check horses after treatment or during a rehabili- tation program. As the speed has an in fluence on the subjective and objective evaluation of asymmetry, Fig. 17. Ground reaction forces on a vertical (Fz-A) and hori- zontal craniocaudal (Fx-B) axes of a at the walk (1.4m/s), trot (4.3m/s) and canter (leading limb, at 6, 8, and 10m/s for Canter 1, 2 and 3).

Functional anatomy of the distal interphalangeal joint of the left forelimb when the foot position is asymmetricalon a left turn. Elevation of the lateral quarter induces medial rotation of the distal phalanx (P3), tension of the medial collat- eral ligament (MCL) and relaxation of the lateral collateral lig- ament (LCL). As the lateral part of the condyle of the middle phalanx moves in a palmar direction, pressure is concentratedon the lateral part of the distal sesamoid bone (DSB) and the distal sesamoidean ligament (DSL) is stretched laterally. The lateral lobe of the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) receives pressure from the DSB and of this tendon isstretched.FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTURE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 115trotting speed should be adapted and consistent on repeated occasions for diagnostic purposes and to check the horse after diagnostic analgesia or treatments.97,98 Forelimbs at the trot on a straight line. In most situations (except in perfectly bilateral lameness), todecrease the loading rate and load intensity on the lamer limb the horse uses the inertia of the swing of the cervicocephalic pendulum (head and neck) anddecreases the cranial phase of the stride. The resultof this strategy is a reduction in fetlockextension. How is this strategy expressed clinically? When examining a horse from the front (or the rear), alteration of the sinusoidal pattern of the headtrajectory showing asymmetrical oscillations is the most obvious clinical manifestation of a forelimb lameness. These asymmetrical head and neck oscil-lations can also be seen from the side, but as head movements can disturb their regularity, this criterion can be dif cult to assess, especially for low grade lameness. Altered sinusoidal pattern of the verticaldisplacement over time of the withers is often a morereliable manifestation of the horse 'ss t r a t e g yt op u t more weight on the sounder limb (Fig. 18). 27To decrease cumulation of vertical (z axis) and horizontal(x axis) loading rate after landing at the trot on a hard surface, the lame limb shortens the cranial phase of the stride. This is seen in many conditions including interphalangeal, fetlock, carpus, elbow, and shoulder conditions. In horses with pain in the suspensory ap-paratus, the increased loading rate combined with a peak of load in this apparatus during the cranial part of the stance phase 67,71induces a clear reduction of the cranial part of the stance phase at the trot com-pared to the walk. As mentioned above for shoulderand CTB syndromes, reduction of the cranial phase of the stride is often clearer at the walk. Even when a horse has demonstrated a reduction of the caudal phase of the stride at the walk (e.g., for podotrochlear syndrome), the cranial phase of the stride is moreaffected at the trot. It seems like the horse is more sensitive to the increased forces at the trot (kinetic effect) and less sensitive to the movement (kinematic effect). As mentioned above, at the walk, a slower movement and a longer stance phase duration with-out suspension phase increase the impact of distal interphalangeal joint extension on clinical mani- festations. The decreased vertical load intensity and the reduction of the cranial phase of the stride induce a decreased fetlock extension on the lamer limb com-pared to the opposite limb (Fig. 19). 58,59This reduc- tion of fetlock extension is more pronounced in horseswith pain in either the fetlock or the suspensory apparatus. In horses affected by a functional de cit of the suspensory apparatus or flexor tendons (rup- ture or elongation), the difference in fetlock extensionduring the stance phase is not proportional to the uneven loading of the limbs as expressed by the asym- metrical sinusoidal trajectory of the more proximal jointor periarticular injuries of the forelimb induce changes in movements of flexion-extension. This is especially seen for shoulder injuries (e.g., osteochon- drosis, bicipital apparatus injuries) carpi radialis injuries. Hindlimbs at the trot on a firm straight line. When examining the horse from the rear, redistribution of the load from the lamer limb to thesounder limb is associated with an asymmetrical Fig. 18. Vertical displacement over time (x axis: % of the stride) determined from inertial measurement units at the trot on a straight line on a hard surface of the head, withers, and tuber sacrale of a 6-year-old jumper female presenting a chronic podo-trochlear bursitis with adhesion between the deep digital flexor tendon and the suprasesamoidean ligament on the leftforelimb. The head and withers drop during the right forelimb (RF) stance phase demonstrating a reduction of load (weight bear- ing lameness) of the left forelimb (LF).

The different curves represent the tra- jectories of successive strides.FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTURE 116 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSsinusoidal pattern of the tuber sacrale trajec- tory. Comparison of the left and right tuber coxae trajectories has also been used for diagnosing hind- limb lameness.99Nevertheless, as demonstrated by most of the technical devices used for gait analysis,the tuber sacrale trajectory is a more reliable re flec- tion of the horse' s strategy to put more weight on the sounder limb. This is expressed in an increase in downwards displacement of the tuber sacrale during the cranial part of the stance phase of the sounder limb which subsequently moves up the hindquarters (and tuber sacrale) using the inertia of the bodyweightto reduce the load during the stance phase of the lamer limb (Fig. 20). Discrimination between load absorption lameness and propulsion lameness can be done by considering the trajectory of the tuber sacrale. 32,33Alteration of the sinusoidal pattern of the head (cervicocephalic pendulum) movement can be seen with moderate to severe hindlimb lameness. Lowering of the neck is synchronous to the stance phase of the lamer hindlimb in an attempt to shift the load to the forelimb diagonally. Forexample, to reduce the load on a painful left hindlimb, the horse increases the weight on the right forelimb, the head exhibiting a lower position during the right diagonal stance phase. This has been con rmed using kinematic analysis of lame horses and ofinduced lameness on a treadmill. 100,101 Examining the horse at the trot from the side facili- tates identi cation of a reduction of the cranial phase of the stride. Just as on the forelimbs, the shorten- ing of the engagement reduces the horizontal compo- nent of the ground reaction force and the duration (and therefore the impulse) of the load absorption part of the stance phase. As a consequence of theweight redistribution and shortening of the cranial phase of the stride, asymmetrical extension of thefetlocks can be seen from the side and the rear, with the horse exhibiting more extension of the fetlock inthe sounder limb and less extension in the lamer limb(Fig 20). However, in horses with alteration of fet-lock suspension induced by elongation of the suspen-sory apparatus or the flexor tendons, fetlock extension can be exaggerated despite a reduction of load. Inaddition, asymmetrical flexion of the hocks during the stance phase can be observed with less flexion on the lamer limb due to the reduction of weight inducingless passive elongation of the SDF muscle and tendonas well as the super cial and deep aponeuroses of the gastrocnemius and lateral digital flexor muscles (Fig. 20 and 21). Dragging of the toe of the lame limbclose to its mid-swing phase is a swing phase abnor-mality but not necessarily a swing phase lameness: itis the consequence of a lack of elevation of the croupby the lame limb during its propulsion phase, followedby a downwards displacement of the hindquartersduring the stance phase of the sounder limb.

At trot on a straight line on hard ground the croup is higher during mid-stance phase of the right hind- limb and lower during mid-stance phase of the left hindlimb. On the right hindlimb, there is less flexion of the hock and less extension of the fetlock than of the left one at mid- stance phase. As a consequence, during the mid-swing phase, the right toe is closer to the ground surface than the left one. Fig. 21.

The trot is the most adequate gait for evaluation of the passive dorsoventral flexibility of the thoracolumbar spine.102- 105At the trot electro- myographic studies combined with kinematic analysis have demonstrated that the thoracolumbar spine issubject to passive flexibility induced by the alternat- ing up and downwards movement of the abdominalvisceral mass during the succession of support andsuspension phases. 100,105- 109Elevation of the visceral mass during the propulsion phase of one diagonalinduces passive flexion of the thoracolumbar spine which is stabilized by the extensor epaxial(erector spinae and multi dus) muscles (Fig. 22). Dropping of the abdominal visceral mass atlanding pulls down the thoracolumbar spine andits extension is limited by the flexor hypoaxial (iliopsoas and abdominal wall) muscles. Thispassive flexibility of the thoracic, thoracolumbar, and lumbosacral areas is not synchronous and decreases with the speed (Fig. 22). 105,106,108It is also reduced in horses with back pain (F. Audigi\u00e9,unpublished data) and during the stance phase of alame diagonal. 110,111Its visual assessment helps to diagnose horses with pain or injuries of the thoraco- lumbar spine (kissing spines, articular process arthro- pathies, spondylosis) or of the lumbosacroiliacarea.92,112,113 A horse with back pain or caudal neck pain tries to reduce thoracolumbar flexion and extension movements by increasing the axial muscle tone. Clinically thehorse demonstrates back (or neck) stiffness. It mustbe mentioned that horses with bilateral limb problems (especially forelimbs) reduce the elevation of the gait and therefore reduce visceral mass displacement andacceleration which consequently induces similarly areduction of thoracolumbar flexibility. The differential d i a g n o s i si st h e nm a d eb yc o m p a r i n gt h eh o r s e 'sg a i to n soft ground which usually reduces distal limb manifes- tations and increases axial contribution to the gait (see below). Assessment of cervicothoracic flexibility is more dif cult and less speci c. It is more dependent on the forelimb locomotion. Trot on the Lunge in a Circle on Firm Ground Horses with symmetrical movement on the straight line have been shown to present vertical head and pel- vic asymmetry during lunging and this should not be interpreted as lameness. 114In this study, less than half of the horses showing symmetrical gait on astraight line had inversed and equivalent asymmetri-cal movements of the head and pelvis when examinedon the lunge in opposite directions. This demon-strates that examination on the straight line has limi- tations to detect pain or biological or acquired laterality of the horse. Forelimbs at the trot on circles on firm surfa- ces. The majority of forelimb lamenesses are worse when the affected limb is on the inside of thecircle. As the horse leans inside to balance the cen-trifugal force, 115and as the feet are closer than the proximal parts of the limbs, the inside forelimb and hindlimb are more oblique to the ground surface than the outside limbs (Fig. 23). Therefore, collateromo-tion and associated rotation are higher on the insidelimbs. These extrasagittal movements explain whypain on distal joints and in the podotrochlear appara-tus including the distal part of the DDF tendon, is exacerbated when the affected limb is inside the circle (Fig. 16). 87Clinical manifestations of some condi- tions involving the proximal limb are less affected bycollateromotion and rotation but may also, to a lessere x t e n t ,b ew o r s ew h e nt h el a m el i m bi si n s i d et h ecircle.

As thesuspensory apparatus is more affected by the loading rate and peak of load than by collateromotion and rotation, lameness induced by suspensory disease is usually clearer on a straight line and on the oppositecircle. Horses presenting dyskinetic protractioninduced by CTB syndrome or shoulder syndrome(scapulohumeral arthropathies or bicipital apparatusinjuries) show a slower swing phase ending with areduced cranial phase of the stride when the affectedlimb is placed outside the circle. Lameness severitycan be similar on both circles in case of desmopathiesof the lateral collateral ligaments of the interphalan-geal and metacarpophalangeal joints, subchondralbone trauma of the medial part of the metacarpal con-dyle, as well as some elbow and shoulder jointconditions. For (subchondral) bone conditions, painis generated by collateromotion and rotation when thelimb is inside the circle and by concentration of thepressure at the medial aspect of the affected limbwhen it is outside the circle. In lateral collateral des-mopathies and enthesopathies, pain is generated byincreased tension on the ligament when the affectedlimb is outside the circle and by extrasagittal move-ments of the painful joint when this limb is inside thecircle. Hindlimbs at the trot on circles on a firm sur- face. A sound horse trotting on a circle puts more load on the outside hindlimb to counteractthe centrifugal force. 117It is essential to Fig. 24. Trajectories determined from inertial measurement units at the trot on a hard surface of the head, withers, and tuber sacrale of a 12-year-old jumper female presenting a subchondral bone trauma of the medial part of the metacarpal condyle on the left forelimb. On a straight line, the mare showed a very mild reduction of the load on the left forelimb (LF) and puts more load on the right hindlimb as a potential expression of diagonal compensation. On the left circle the trajectory of the withers is symmetricalbut the head drops on the right forelimb (RF); after elevation of the croup by the inside LH, the tuber sacrale drops more on the right hindlimb. On the right circle, although there should be more load on the outside LF, the head and withers markedly drop during the RF stance phase (red line). The subchondral bone pain at the medial side of the fetlock is responsible for this stance phase lameness, exaggerated on the opposite circle. As the head drops during the RF diagonal stance phase, there is less load on the out- side LH. The different curves represent the trajectories of successive strides. Fig. 23. Orientation of the forelimbs on a circle on a hard surface. The horse 's body leans toward the center of the circle; the inside limb (A) is adducted and is more obliquely placed over the ground surface inducing more collateromotion (here latero- motion) on its distal joints than the outside limb (B) whose distal joints are subjected to mediomotion.FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTURE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 119compare the asymmetrical movements of the pel- vis and fetlock extension of both hindlimbs on theleft vs right circle to avoid overdiagnosis oflameness. This can be demonstrated establish-ing the asymmetrical patternof the tuber sacrale using downwardsdisplacement of the tuber sacrale during thestance phase of the outside hindlimb. 114,118- 120 Compared to the normal range of hindlimb asym- metry on circles, horses presenting lamer, with areduction of the cranial phase of the stride when theaffected hindlimb is inside the circle as limb obliquityincreases collateromotion and associated rotationcausing pain. 87As the load is higher on the outside limb,117horses presenting with pain in the suspen- sory apparatus may be lamer when the affected limbis outside in a circle on a hard surface. In horses with severe pain, the downwards displacement of the tuber sacrale can be seen on the sounder insidehindlimb. Nevertheless, horses with desmopathy orenthesopathy of the medial branch of the suspensoryligament may stay lamer when the affected limb isinside the circle as lateromotion increases the stressof this branch. Other conditions involving themedial aspect of the hindlimb such theaffected is outside the circle, as pressure forcesare increased medially.Axial regions on circles. On the circle, the verte- bral axis of the horse combines movements of flexion- extension movements with laterofl exion and rotation and the range of motion is greater compared to the straight line. 93,100,118Therefore, visual assessment of the amount of motion is facilitated especially whenthe horse decelerates from trot to walk. At the troton the lunge in a circle, the sinusoidal pattern of thethoracolumbar oscillation is different for the two diag-onal stance phases. As there is more load absorptionon the outside hindlimb, there is more extension dur- ing the stance phase of this limb than during the stance phase of the inside hindlimb. These asym-metrical flexion-extension movements combined with latero flexion and rotation can exacerbate thoracolum- bar pain and create discomfort resulting in backstiffness and reduction of the stride length andsuspension. 3. Soft Surface on the Lunge When examining a horse in a circle on soft ground care should be taken by the operator holding the lunge as horses can buck from happiness on soft surfaces andmay be dangerous, especially if they had a reduction ofphysical activity before the examination. Examination at the Trot on the Lunge on Soft Ground Comparing the gait abnormalities on soft and hard surface contributes signi cantly to the differential di- agnosis of the cause of lameness and to the critical Fig. 25. Trajectories determined from inertial measurement units at the trot on a hard surface of the head, withers, and tuber sacrale of a 7-year-old dressage female presenting a suprasesamoidean lesion of the lateral lobe of the deep digital flexor tendon on the left forelimb. This female presents a reduction of load (loading lameness) of the left forelimb (LF) on straight line and on theleft circle, the head and withers dropping on the RF stance phase. On the right circle, the trajectory of the head is more symmetri- cal, but there is a lack of elevation of the withers during the propulsion phase of the left forelimb. This propulsion lameness can be explained by the increased tension on the lateral lobe of the left deep digital flexor tendon on the right circle. The different curves represent the trajectories of successive strides.FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTURE 120 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSassessment of the signi cance of imaging ndings at the end of the examination. A soft surface is chosen to change the biomechanical stresses on the limbs;deep surfaces should be avoided for the routine diag-nostic approach as the muscular demand for propul-sion is increased and active efforts mask diagnosticinformation. Trotting speed and the radius of thecircle may in fluence the grade of asymmetrical movements. 119Generally speaking, on soft ground surfaces the loading rate and loading intensity on the limbs decrease (Fig. 26)121,122but propulsion forces and therefore the load on the tendons increase (Fig. 27).73,123Moreover, on soft deformable surface, collat- eromotion and associated rotation are reduced as thefoot penetrates more and the position of the center ofpressure moves toward the center of the foot (Fig.28). 124,125Therefore, the clinical manifestations of foot problems and distal or intermediate limb arthropa-thies improve more than those of proximal limbarthropathies or tendinopathies. Lameness inducedby recent tendinopathies tend to be worse on a softground. 58,66Discussion on the properties of different types of surface is beyond the scope of this paper. Forelimbs When the affected limb is on the inside of the circle, horses presenting with chronic foot problems or distal arthropathies are improved on soft ground com- pared to the clinical manifestations on a hard surface. Improvement is less clear for intermediatearthropathies and mild or absent for proximal lameness. The lameness is rarely worse on soft ground, but this can be seen for recent and severe dis-tal DDF tendon injuries. When the affected limb is on the outside of the circle, horses presenting recent injuries of the suspensory apparatus or flexor tendons (SDF and DDF tendons) are not improved or can be worse on soft ground. Several biomechanical factors are responsible for that including the higher load onthe outside limb, 117the increased need for propulsion forces on soft ground, and the interphalangeal flexion reducing the DDF tendon contribution to the fetlocksupport.73,126 As seen in a circle on a hard ground, horses present- ing dyskinetic protraction induced by CTB syndrome or shoulder syndrome show a slower protraction dur- ing the swing phase ending with a reduced cranialphase of the stride when the affected limb is placed outside the circle. Hindlimbs Many lame horses with distal or middle hindlimb injuries improve on soft ground compared to similar situations on hard ground as a result of the reduction in concussion, load absorption and extrasagittal move- ments, especially when the lamer limb is on the insideof the circle. Horses presenting pain in the suspen- sory apparatus typically present an exacerbation of the lameness when the affected limb is on the outsideof the circle. As for forelimbs, this is explained by the higher load on the outside hindlimb, the increased propulsion forces on soft ground and the lower DDFtendon contribution to the fetlock support (Fig.29). 73,126T h es a m eo b s e r v a t i o nc a nb em a d ew i t h horses presenting lesions of the gastrocnemius or digi-talflexor (SDF, DDF) tendons. When the affected limb is on the outside of the circle, horses presenting with recent episodes of pain in the distal tarsus (bone spavin) or in the medial femorotibial joint are not ormildly improved as the reduction of loading rate on soft ground is canceled by the concentration of load at the medial aspect of the joint. Axial Regions In horses with pain or sensitivity in the distal joints, the suspension phase is reduced and passive vertebral axis flexibility decreases on the circle on a hard ground (see above). As these horses are more com- fortable on a soft surface and display more active gaits, examination of the horse trotting on the lunge on soft ground facilitates assessment of the passive Fig. 26.

Examination at Canter on the Lunge on Soft Ground In a study performed on 12 galloping horses on a straight line, no signi cant difference was observed in head and pelvis acceleration and rotation, limb tim- ing, and stride duration measurement, before andafter induction of lameness in the forelimb and hindlimb.37Comparing left and right circles, asym- metry can be detected in forelimb and hindlimbm o v e m e n t sa sw e l la si na x i a lp o s i t i o n i n ga n dmobilization.

In vivo evaluation of the force in the super cial digital flexor tendon at the walk and trot on asphalt (dark curves) and on a mixed ber sand track (light grey curves). The peak of tension takes place during the rst part of the stance phase at the walk; it is higher and around the mid-stance phase at the trot. Maximal tendon force was higher on sand than on asphalt at both gaits. The duration of tendon loading was longer on sand and the area under the curve (impulse) was larger at both walk and trot.

On both circles, the trajectory of the center of pressure of the foot is closer to the sagittal plane on the soft surface.

Horses with neck or back pain tend to pull on the lunge or be counter-incurvated (Fig. 31). In horses with back pain, a lack of thoracolumbar latero-flexion (lateral bending, incurvation) predisposes the horse to display a disunited or rotary canter as the inside hindlimb is not placed adequately to achieve protraction. 104 Forelimbs and Hindlimbs Biomechanical studies at the canter demonstrated that the vertical load was higher on the diagonal (trailing forelimb-leading hindlimb). There was more deceleration on the leading limbs and more pro-pulsion on the trailing limbs. 132- 134The canter high- lights some defects in limb movement and especially protraction. Dyskinesia of the forelimbs induced by neurological de cits related to cervicothoracic arthro- pathies (part of the CTB syndrome) is usually morepronounced on the outside forelimb (Fig. 32). When the most affected limb is placed inside the circle, the horse may canter on the wrong sounder leadinglimb (leading limb outside) in a reiterated manner Fig. 29. Average forces on the right hindlimb (RH) placed on the inside or outside of a circle at trot and canter performed on a mixed sand and ber surface. At the trot the vertical peak of load is higher on the left circle when the RH is on the outside of the circle. At the canter, the vertical peak of load is higher on the left circle too when the RH is the trailing limb. (FromCrevier-Denoix et al. 2017, with permission). Fig. 30. Cranial view of the thoracolumbar vertebral column. Latero flexion of the spine (to the left) is always associated with rotation on the opposite direction (to the right). These combined movements induce shearing of the interspinous syndesmosis, stresses on the capsules and surfaces of the articular process joints and rotation of the intervertebral discs.

MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTURE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 123(Fig. 33). As mentioned above, a wrong placement of the hindlimbs (disunited canter) can be seen in horses with inadequate thoracolumbar latero flexion. A protraction de cit induced by any injuries of the inside hindlimb can also result in a disunitedcanter. Looking at the horse performing down-ward transitions from canter to trot and from trotto walk is particularly informative on forelimb and hindlimb coordination and on how the horse is distributing the deceleration forces within thedifferent limbs. Small Jumps on the Lunge on Soft Ground Examining jumpers doing small jumps on the lunge may provide additional information on forelimb and hindlimb lameness manifestations. Other objectivesof this simple exercise include checking the owner ortrainer 'sc o n c e r n sa sw e l la sa n a m n e s i sa n dg e t t i n g information on the horse 's athletic capacities and style. 135Axial problems involving either the cervical or the thoracolumbar spine or the lumbosacroiliacjunction need to be considered when the horse 'st e c h - nique, power, and style are altered.57,136 Abnormalities observed during jump approach and take-off include poor forelimb placement, propulsion and impulsion, lack of forequarter elevation, and poor neck mobilization or impulsion. These man- ifestations can be seen in horses with forelimb problems and horses with cervical or thoracolum- bar injuries. A defect in hindlimb propulsion can be seen in jumpers with hindlimb, lumbosacroiliac or thoracolumbar injuries. A decrease in cervical and thoracolumbar mobility is the most obvious manifestation of back pain during the jump suspension or airborne phase. Unilateral or Fig. 34.

MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTURE 124 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSbilateral de cit of forelimb or hindlimb flexion can be related to intrinsic limb injuries or to injuries of the corresponding vertebral segment andnerves. Eccentric contraction of the muscles ofthe proximal forelimb controlling the flexion of the shoulder and elbow joints, and eccentric contrac-tion of the serratii and pectoral muscles as well as dorsal cervical muscles have an essential contri- bution to load absorption at landing after thejump (Fig. 34). 57 Neck stiffness at landing can be a manifestation of neck or thoracic pain (e.g., thoracic spondy-losis). Extension and subsequent flexion of the lumbosacral area can be altered by lumbosacroil-iac pain (Fig. 35). A leading preference at landingcan be the manifestation of several conditions asexplained by biomechanical data (Fig. 36). 137,138As the impulse (combining load and duration representedby the area under the curve) is larger on the leading limb, a horse with suspensory apparatus or fetlock pain prefers placing the painful limb as a trailing limb (contact limb) at reception (Fig. 37). Horses with reduction of protraction as a manifestation of CTB syndrome tend to prefer landing on the lead op- posite to the lesion, the trailing limb being then on the more clinically affected side. 4. Examination of the Horse at Work Ridden Sport or Pleasure Horses Manifestations described above can be reduced or exa- cerbated, not only because of the saddle and rider in- terference, but also because of a different behavior of the horse at work.139- 142Only key data are shortly presented in this paper. Walk Putting the saddle on and tightening the girth may reduce unilateral or bilateral protraction of the forelimbs. Several causes of this manifestation have been documented or suspected such as the CTB syn- drome, withers, and thoracic injuries as well as costo-vertebral arthropathies as pressure over the sternum can reproduce the symptoms. Trot on Alternating Diagonals Between Opposite Turns Compared to the trot in hand and on the lunge, lame- n e s sa tt h et r o to nt h er i d d e nh o r s em a yb ew o r s e n e d because of the rider 'sw e i g h ta n dt e c h n i q u eo r improved by appropriate rider 's management. 143,144 Intensi cation has been seen with suspensory appara- tus conditions in the forelimbs and hindlimbs. As the horse puts more load on the outside hindlimb on a circle (Fig. 29),117trotting on diagonals alternating left and right turns is recommended to evaluate the Fig. 36. Vertical (Fz) and craniocaudal (Fx) ground reaction forces perpendicular and parallel to the solar surface at reception after a jump. The peak of vertical load (Fz) is higher on the contact (trailing) limb (here the right forelimb), but the area under the curve (impulse) is larger on the leading limb (here the left fore). The contact limb achieves mainly propulsion (negative Fx), and the lead-ing limb mainly load absorption (positive Fx). (From Denoix 2014, courtesy to N. Crevier-Denoix, with permission). Fig. 37.

The in fluence of the rider at the rising trot should be considered. 139,145,146,147 During the sitting phase of the rider, the range ofmotion decreases between T12 and L2 and increasesbetween T6-T12 and L2-L5. 148Besides, the roll of the pelvis is reduced and the load increases on the sit-ting diagonal (Fig. 38). 144,148When a forelimb limb presents a decreased fetlock suspension during thestance phase, sitting on the opposite diagonal may decreased fetlock extension asymmetry. Therefore, when a lame forelimb presents a decreased fetlock extension during the stance phase, sitting trot on the corresponding diagonal can attenuate kinematics manifestations of lameness; sitting on the sounder forelimb diagonal tend to increase forelimb extension asymmetry. On a right turn, compared to symmetri- cal sitting trot, at rising trot a left hindlimb lameness t e n d st ob ec l e a r e ra st h er i d e ra d d sw e i g h to nt h e right hindlimb. On the left turn, the rider sits on the right diagonal (right forelimb + left hindlimb) and a left hindlimb lameness tends to be reduced. 146 Canter Additional clinical and athletic information can be obtained at the canter including the horse 'si n t r i n - sic capacities and limitations and the rider 's influence.143Equestrian aspects of assessment of the canter are beyond the scope of this paper.149As for the canter in lunge, the quality of the gait, the mo- bilization and coordination of the limbs and joints, the positioning and mobilization of the axial regions are evaluated. Special attention should be paid when thehorse is changing leads. When no obvious lamenessis observed at the trot, dif culties or defenses during this exercise (to be assessed according to the level of education of the horse and rider) are usually related to proximal limb or axial problems such as the CTBsyndrome for the forelimbs, thoracolumbar injuries orthe lumbosacroiliac syndrome for the hindlimbs. Jumping and Dressage Exercises Examination of the horse at work is routinely done to investigate athletic problems or to check anamnesis when lameness is described as happening in speci c situations or exercises. 140,143This is sometimes required to evaluate diagnostic analgesic techniquesin horses showing insuf cient manifestations during the routine clinical examination in an attempt toget as objective an assessment of the block as possible. This can also be useful to evaluate the horse 's tolerance to different athletic exercises in order to adjust a rehabilitation program. Several studies have investigated the mechanics and kinemat- ics of the horse while jumping. 57,100,136,143,150 Influence of the height of the fence has been investi- gated using kinematic and kinetic analysis of the limbs of jumping horses.138,150- 152 In dressage horses, pain induced by collateromotion and rotation of the distal joints can alter the regular- ity of adduction and abduction movements during lat- eral work (e.g., half pass, shoulder in). Horses presenting a CTB syndrome tend to present a head nod on the sounder side (limb) to facilitate adduction during the swing phase of the more affected side. During a pirouette, as the horse concentrates the weight on the engaged inside hindlimb working asa pivot, the increased ground contact of the foot exac- erbates the stresses induced by the medial rotation of this limb. Just as examples, medial rotation of the hind fetlock joint increases pressure on the lateral proximal sesamoid bone and tension on the deep layer of the medial collateral ligament. Medial rotation of the tarsus increases transverse shearing of the distaltarsal joints, tension of the calcanean fasciculus of the medial collateral ligament and stresses on the grooves of the tibial cochlea. Medial rotation of the femoroti- bial joint increase pressure on the cranial horn of the medial meniscus and tension of the cranial cruciate ligament. The tension of the capitis ligament and pressure on the articular surfaces of the coxofemoral joint are also increased with medial rotation of the corresponding hindlimb. Thoroughbreds Ridden (at Canter) on the Track Examination of horses being ridden at the trot on the track is useful when only mild to moderate asymme- try or lameness can be seen at the walk and the trot in hand. Movement analysis using slow motion video at different gaits is particularly useful to detector con rm visual observations (Fig. 39). Looking at the horse cantering on both left and right leads isessential to identify the horse 's preferred lead, which may be in relation to existing clinical or subclinicalconditions or may predispose to secondary injuries induced by asymmetrical load on diagonals (Fig. 40). 66,132,133,143 Fig. 38. Instruction horse showing a grade 2 left hindlimb lameness. Asymmetry of the extension of the fetlocks is increased by the rider 's movements at the rising trot. The rider sits and puts weight on the left diagonal (therefore on the right hindlimb), increasing extension of the right hind fetlock and flex- ion of the right tarsus. Conversely, the rider 's trunk is elevated during the right diagonal stance phase, reducing interference with the left hindlimb showing a more open angulation of thejoints.FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTURE 126 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSAs the canter is an asymmetrical gait, evaluation of the head, withers, and tuber sacrale trajectories does not provide clear clinical data on the redistribution of load between limbs in a lame horse.66On the fore- limbs, there is a higher fetlock extension on the trail-ing forelimb than on the leading one during the stance phase. Therefore, to assess clinically poten- t i a lr e d u c t i o no fl o a do no n el i m bi ti se s s e n t i a lt oe v a l - uate fetlock extension of the forelimbs or the hindlimbsat the left and right leading canter at the same speed (using slow motion video-recordings). When ridden at a canter, evaluation of the thoracolumbar mobility is limited but manifestations of back pain or discomfort may be exacerbated (Fig. 41). Visual assessment of the lumbosacral flexion and extension movements is easier and the amount of motion increases with thespeed. 37,130 Harness Racing Trotters on the Track Examination of racing Standardbred trotters in hand is often frustrating and observations are not always cor- related to the complaint and anamnesis. Examination of the horse being driven on the track is an essentialpart of the evaluation of lameness and discipline related problems. Only the most common remarks are men- tioned in this paper. 1. It is quite common to observe a lameness on o n es i d ew h e nt h eh o r s ei se x a m i n e di nh a n d and a lameness is on the opposite side on the track. The primary lameness seen at high speed induces an overload of the oppo-site limb at work. At slow speed when thestresses responsible for the manifestationsof the primary lameness are lower, the sec-ondary lameness shows up. Therefore, it iscrucial to identify the primary cause of the athletic manifestations at training or high speed to direct the diagnostic approach andadequately manage the horse. 2. A frequent gait alteration at speed called tra- quenard 153orhiking lameness154can be seen with pain involving the forelimb or the hind- limb on the same side (Fig. 42). The fore- limbs are at the trot and the hindlimbs seem Fig. 39. Four-year-old Thoroughbred crossed gelding steeple-chaser at the walk on the track. At clinical evaluation, there is a reduction of extension of the left fore fetlock (A) compared to the right (B) at mid-stance phase which is even clearer on the video- recordings. Goniometric measures of the dorsal angle of the left (C) and right (D) fore fetlocks during the stance phase con rming the clinical observation; there is more extension on the right fetlock. In vivo measure of the force (in newtons) in the left (E) and right (F) super cial digital flexor (SDF) tendons during the stance phase. The right SDF tendon shows a normal force-over-time pattern; on the left SDF tendon this pattern is altered, mainly during the cranial part of the stance phase. The three evaluations were performed blindly by different operators. The horse had a left front SDF tendonitis and developed this fetlock asymmetry as the tendon got stiffer during a 10-month rehabilitation program without showing any other asymmetry at the trot and canter.

The use of slow-motion video is essential to analyze the fast sequence of limbplacement. In a horse presenting with a leftforelimb lameness as in Fig. 42, the righthindlimb increases protraction and antici-pates ground contact to reduce load on thepainful left forelimb. As the right hindlimb lands before the left forelimb, the distancebetween the limbs of the left diagonal increases. As propulsion made by the right hind is more effective, landing of the left hind-limb is delayed inducing shortening of the right diagonal distance. 58The same features are observed in a horse presenting with a left hind lameness. Complementary analysis ofthis gait alteration can be performed using a video-camera placed over the helmet of the driver (Fig. 43). 3. A common manifestation on turns is to put more load on the inside hindlimb at medium and high speeds. Therefore, a hindlimb lameness is often worse when the affected Fig. 40. Angle-time diagram of the palmar aspect of the carpus and dorsal aspect of the fetlock of horses at canter on the turf showing more fetlock extension and less carpal extension during the mid-stance phase on the trailing limb compared to the lead-ing limb. The same research group has shown that there was a higher load on the trailing limb during the stance phase. (From Crevier Denoix N et al, 2013 with permission). Fig. 41. Six-year-old Thoroughbred steeple-chaser female atthe canter on the track. Contrary to the nice attitude of thebay horse, this chestnut lly demonstrates manifestations of dis- comfort at canter: neck extension, flattened ears, tail switch. She had severe kissing spine lesions between the tho- racic vertebrae T12 and T18 and arthropathies of the articular process joints between T17 and L1. Same lly as Fig. 31. Fig. 42. Three-year-old harness Standardbred trotter gelding examined on the track at training speed. The horse exhibits the traquenard, trotting with the frontlimbs and cantering with the hindlimbs. This abnormal gait can be induced by different conditions of the forelimbs, hindlimbs, and vertebral axis. Thehorse presented in this gure, showing a reduced protraction of the left forelimb (right image), had a subchondral and spongiousbone cyst in the metacarpal condyle and a fracture of the exten- sor process of the distal phalanx on this limb. Fig. 43. Four-year-old harness Standardbred trotter maleexamined on the track at training speed. The camera is placed on the helmet of the driver. The horse shows more protractionof the left hindlimb crossing laterally to the left foot and less pro- traction of the right hindlimb. The right latero flexion is reduced compared to the left and the right hindlimb shows alack of abduction with a risk of interference with the right fore foot. This horse had a bilateral sacroiliac arthropathy.FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTURE 128 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSlimb is outside the turn. For example, when a trotter presents with a left hindlimb lame-ness on a straight line, quite systematicallythe lameness is worse on the right turn and the horse is improved on the left turn. 4. A de cit in forelimb protraction is responsible for an asymmetrical forelimb gait called aubin . 153The hindlimbs are at the trot and the forelimbs seem to canter (Fig. 44). The protraction de cit (swing phase lameness) is worse when the affected limb is on the outside of the turn. Different conditions can inducethis gait abnormality ranging from distal limb injuries up to CTB syndrome. 5. Hindlimb asymmetry induces a corresponding forelimb asymmetry. Therefore, a complete clinical and imaging evaluation of the corre-sponding lateral (forelimb and hindlimb of the same side) is required. 6. The lumbosacral joint is highly specialized in flexion and extension. Rotation and, above all, latero flexion are limited. Unlike in Thoroughbreds showing wide lumbosacral flexion-extension movements at fast speeds, in trotters protraction of one hindlimb is syn-chronous to propulsion of the opposite limband rotation becomes the main movement ofthe lumbosacral junction. This explains why intertransverse lumbosacral arthropathy is a common condition in racing trotters. 92,113 5. Conclusions Lame horses are live illustrations of functional anat- omy and biomechanics. The trot is often considered as the reference gait for lameness evaluation and to assess diagnostic analgesia. Much information canbe gained when the horse is examined at the walk, some of which (such as forelimb protraction or fetlocksuspension) becoming less clear or even disappearingat faster gaits. Looking at the horse in different sit-uations in hand and on the lunge, combining differentsurfaces and different exercises of training and evencompeting allows for a complete clinical and athleticassessment of the horse and understanding of its gaitalterations. Identi cation of the best as well as the worst situations for the horse is not only essentialfrom a diagnostic point of view but also providesadequate pieces of information to establish thebest rehabilitation program for each individualpatient. At present kinematic and kinetic technolo-g i e sa r eb e i n gd e v e l o p e dt op r o v i d eo b j e c t i v ed a t at oevaluate lameness in horses; these devices are welladapted for assessment of a symmetrical gait such asthe trot. In practice, evaluation of the different gaitsand exercise conditions can be done using video- recordings in the eld. Their analysis enables a global and detailed evaluation of the horse 's locomotion as every joint can be assessed independently. Moreover, based on these recordings, a more objectivefollow up of the horse 's locomotion can be done at sev- eral months or even yearly intervals allowing a moreaccurate assessment of the evolution of the disease pro-cess, of the ef cacy of a treatment and/or of a rehabilita- tion program. No doubt that instrumental analysis oflocomotion in horses will bring new data on the mani-festations of pain, mechanical, and neurological disor-ders in the future. We must keep in mind that fewhorses display symmetrical gaits, so the new challengeis to determine what is an acceptable degree ofasymmetry. As locomotion is the expression of an end-less number of biological factors, the answer varieswith individual horses and the diagnosis and prognosisof locomotor variations and troubles is not dependentonly on gures, graphs, or statistical analysis but must consider the interindividual capacity of tolerance to pain as well as to the physical and functional asymmetry. The mixture of objective data combinedwith individual expression make this eld of equine locomotion and its alterations such an exciting and fas-cinating discipline.

At rst these groups were focused on acquiring companion animal practices, but as more and more of the primecompanion animal practices have been purchased theyare turning their attention to other species. The ac-quisition of veterinary practices in North America isrelatively new, but it has been going on for many yearsin Europe. Presently, 50% of companion animal vet-erinary practices in the UK and 60% of practices inSweden are corporate owned. 1More recently consoli- dators are quickly buying practices of all species in theUK, Netherlands, and Germany. In North America, 25% of companion animal practices are expected to be corporate owned by 2023.1Regardless of which region of the world is being targeted for corporate acquisitions,purchase amounts seem to be exceptionally high, andmany veterinary practice owners wonder if they shouldjump in and be part of the bonanza of seemingly highvaluations placed on practices. At the same time, sell-ing a practice to an outside group can be the basis ofmany questions. Will things remain the same? Willthe vets and staff be taken care of? Will our legacy bepreserved? Most practice owners would prefer to sell toan associate, but the high load of student debt in theUnited States can often make a younger vet cautiousabout increasing their debt load to buy a practice. Inaddition, the purchase prices offered by consolidatorsare often far higher than what an associate could affordto pay. Many veterinary practice owners whopreviously thought they would never sell to a corporateaggregator are forcing practice owners to re-evaluatetheir opposition due to the absence of internal purchas-ers and the high price offered by these groups. Likeany high stake transaction, it is helpful for practiceowners to understand who they are selling to and if thepromise of a high payout is actually what it seems tobe. The purpose of this presentation will be to discussthe business model of these aggregators, why veteri-nary businesses are attractive to these corporategroups, determine if their offers to purchase are as lu-crative as they appear to be and nally the pros and cons of selling to a corporate aggregator. 2. Business Models There are three types of entities that are buying vet-erinary practices. The rst are family owned private entities like Mars Inc, the owners of VCA, Blue Pearl,Baneld in North America and Anicura in Europe, and JAB Holdings, the investment vehicle for aGerman family that owns NVA, a large group of com-panion animal hospitals in North America, Australia,and New Zealand. 2The latter group has recently purchased many equine practices in North Americaover the past 2 years. Typically, they prefer to buy51-100% of a practice so that they can have a control- ling interest in the acquisition. These types of enti-ties typically have a long vision for their portfoliocompanies and since they are privately owned do notneed to respond to short term market forces facingpublic companies or private equity rms. Often, the NOTES 134 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSIDENTIFYING INDUSTRY TRENDS AND THEIR EFFECT ON EQUINE PRACTICEacquisition of veterinary hospitals is complementary to other assets. For example, Mars also owns Royal Canin prescription pet food as well as Sound/ Antech. The second type of aggregators are publiccompanies that are listed on stock exchanges. Thelargest of these groups is CVS Group PLC based inthe United Kingdom. They own over 480 practicesand over the past 2 years have moved into the equineveterinary market. Like Mars Inc. they have adiverse animal health care portfolio that includesdiagnostic laboratories, crematoriums, and e-commerce. Like other public companies, it has to an-swer to shareholders and their expectations for nan- cial returns that ideally outperform the market. Thenal group of aggregators are private equity rms. Their basic business model is to collect a fund of money from investors in order to buy a business, orgroup of businesses, and then sell them within 4-6 years for a much higher value than the original pur-chase value. 3,4Investors in a private equity fund can range from high net worth individuals to institu-tional investors like pension funds, hedge funds andinsurance companies. The private equity companywill identify a business or industry that is poorly man-aged or has undervalued assets. They develop abusiness case that tells these investors that they canacquire these assets and with proper management orconsolidation of a portion of industry can sell themwithin 4-6 years for a far larger sum. In other words,they do an excellent job of buying at a low price andselling at a much higher value. Private equityacquisitions are often nanced through debt. They do this by using a portion of the invested fund tomake some purchases and then rely on debt to acquirethe rest of the targeted businesses. The debt is heldby the acquired companies and not the private equitycompany. In the case of nancial dif culty or bank- ruptcies, the acquired businesses are liable for debt repayments. This was more pronounced years ago and was responsible for the bad reputation associatedwith private equity companies. Many business ana-lysts think the downfall of Toys R 'Us was related to the enormous debt burden placed on it by a private eq-uity rm. It left the company cash starved and unable to compete against the likes of Amazon sinceany excess pro ts were used to pay back their debt. 5The other relevant aspect about private eq- uityrms is how they are compensated. Typically, they charge the fund 2% of revenue annually andreceive 20% of the pro t from the sale. In the case of vet practices that collectively gross $40,000,000 annu-ally and are sold for $80,000,000, they would receive$800,000 annually as a management fee and 20% or$8,000,000 of the excess pro t of $40,000,000 when they sell. In practice this means the private equitym a n a g e r sa r ei n c e n t i v i z e dt om a x i m i z er e v e n u e ,through acquiring more businesses or raising prices and maximizing pro tability through a combination of increased prices charged to the end user and mini- mizing expenses. A critical aspect to consider of theprivate equity business model is that to accomplishtheir end goal of selling their businesses for a higher value, they are actively working to sell their portfolio of veterinary practices to another company. The rst 1-3 years of their plan will often be to acquire as manypractices as possible. They will then spend years 4 and 5 nurturing these companies to increase revenue and pro tability and then by year 6 sell the practices at a maximum value. The timeline may be a bit s h o r t e ro rl o n g e r ,b u ti d e a l l yt h ef u n d st h e ya r ew o r k - ing with have a n i t el i f es p a ni no r d e rt og e tt h e expected returns. Private corporate groups will havea much longer horizon for their holdings and may keep them for decades, or until a more promising investment opportunity occurs. At such a time they will restructure their portfolios by selling some assets tonance the acquisitions for their new focus. Unlike private companies like Mars Inc and Jap Holdings Inc, acquirers of veterinary practices that are listed on stock exchanges or are private equity rms are in the business of maximizing shareholder value.Compensation of these companies are often dependent on meeting or exceeding market expectations, or what was promised investors. 3. The Allure of Equine Veterinary Practices to Consolidators Now that we know about the business model of the main types of companies buying veterinary practices, the obvious question is why are they so attracted to the veterinary industry? The simple answer is that veterinary practices are relatively recession proof and offer nancial returns that are far higher than con- ventional investments like bonds, or equities in thestock market. In other words, veterinary practices are low risk vehicles that carry high nan- cial returns. This is the goal for any in- vestor. Fundamentally, these groups are buying future cash flows of a business. This is primarily determined by the EBITDA of a company, or earn-ings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The latter two items are account- ing terms that refer to how a business will spread the cost over time of large purchases, like digi- tal radiology systems or leasehold improve-ments. According to a nancial overview of 24 equine veterinary practices, 6the average EBITDA was 12.7%. This means if a practice has revenue of $1,000,000, they would have an EBITDA of $127,000. One way that veterinary practices are valued for sale is to determine the average normalized EBITDA over the previousthree years. A normalized EBITDA accounts for situations where certain business expenses or revenues that are not directly related to the oper- ation of the business for sale are added or deducted from EBITDA. To ensure that their investment in the future cash flows of company is secured, the buyer will assess how risky the investment could be. For example, a practice with three plus veterinarians with a broad rangeIDENTIFYING INDUSTRY TRENDS AND THEIR EFFECT ON EQUINE PRACTICE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 135of clients spread over a number of veterinarians is a safer investment than a one-veterinarian practice. Once the single veterinarian leaves the practice, there is a very good chance the clientswould leave too. There is a greater chance thatif one of the veterinarians left the multi-practi-tioner practice that the loss of clients would beminimal, thus the latter situation is a saferinvestment. Valuations of a practice will ofteninclude a multiplier that is directly related to therisk involved in purchasing future cash flows. It reflects the ability to recoup the investment on a yearly basis. The one veterinarian practicewould have a multiplier of 1 or less indicatingthat the risk is high. The multi-veterinarianpractice could have a multiple of 4 or 5 becauset h e r ei sl e s sr i s k ,a n dt h eb u y e rf e e l sc o n dent that their investment could be recouped in 4-5 years. Currently, corporate consolidators areusing a multiple of between 6-10 EBITDA when purchasing lower risk large group practices. If they are planning on selling in 4-6 years, why arethey paying a rate when they won' ts e et h e i r return in 6-10 years? The answer is simple, ifthey can aggregate a large number of practices,they reduce the risk even more and can sell to alarger aggregator for greater than double themultiple they initially paid for the originalpractices. If they bought numerous practiceswith a combined EBITDA of $20,000,000 andused a multiple of 8 they would buy the group ofpractices for $160,000,000 with the hope of sellingthe aggregate for at least 16 times multiple, or$320,000,000. Ideally, they would also improvethe overall EBITDA during their ownership by 1-3%. Going back to the original EBITDA of$20,000,000 a 3% improvement by the time theysell again will give them an EBITDA of $20,600,000, which when multiplied by 16 gives a selling price of $329,000,000, a $9,000,000improvement. In addition, a consolidator will bepaid 20% of the nal selling price above the initial purchase price. If there was no improvementin pro tability, they would pocket 20% of $160,000,000 or $32,000,000 and if they improvedprotability by 3% they would gain an extra $1,800,000 from the additional $9,000,000 sellingprice. There are conditions that are oftenapplied by the buyer. They will want the sellingveterinarians to stay on for 2-3 years to help withthe transition to newer veterinarians. They willhold back 25-30% of the sale price and pay thatonce this period is over. Associated with thismay be performance metrics that once reached in2-3 years allows the seller to get a bonus on top ofthe initial selling price. Some buyers will insistthat this 25-30% of the selling price be invested into the group of practices. The payback to the selling owners will be when the aggregate of prac-tices is sold to the next buyer. This could be asubstantial reward to the practice sellers if thenew purchasers are willing to pay a much higher multiple of EBITDA. All of these are incorpo- r a t e dt om i t i g a t er i s kf o rt h eb u y e r . T h e yd o n 't want a practice owner to sell the practice andthen start up a new business in the area and they want them invested in the success of their own practice, but also that of a combined group ofpractices. Finally, many corporate consolidators will welcome an associate that owns a small per- centage of the practice to maintain their owner- ship at the time of the sale, but there is often wording in the sale agreement that when the group of practices are sold that the minority shareholders have to sell as well. We can see how the veterinary profession could be so attractive to corporate consolidators because of the low riskand high returns. The questions then arises if they are offering a fair price to selling veterinary practice owners. 4. Are the Prices Paid to Purchase Equine Veterinary Practices Sufficient? The reality is that the high numbers that are being offered to practice sellers seem lucrative but don 'tn e c - essarily lead to a pot of gold. There is a very good - nancial argument that practice owners with more than a 5 year horizon before they want to sell would receive less overall compensation compared to whatthey would recoup if they sold in 5 years or more. Consider the scenario where a practice is sold today. Let' s say, for example, the practice is valued at $2.5 million. They will ask the sellers to stay onfor 2-3 years to help with the transition to the new owners. For the three years, the past owners will get a veterinary salary, but afterwards they are living onthe proceeds from the sale. They may get a 5-7% return on their investment if they are lucky, but they w i l la l s ob e g i nt od r a wd o w no nt h e i rn e s te g gf o rl i v - ing expenses. Not a bad life for someone entering their golden years. A just reward for all of the years being a vet is to have 20-30 years with their spouse and family doing whatever they want to do. Now imagine they are 55 or younger, and they have many years of practice ahead of them. Is selling now thebest option? The reality is that there are very few - nancial scenarios that make sense to sell now. Aseller will make more money by holding on for several years and reap the real value of their practice. The math is simple. Collect a vet salary. Collect the an- nual pro t from the business, work on the business a bit more to nd 1 or 2 percentage points of pro tabil- ity, and then sell to an associate or a corporate groupwhen they really want to retire. Even if someone sells in 10 years at a lower multiple than they would now, they will reap the bene ts by waiting. Here is what math tells us: if we compare selling now for $2million and selling in 10 years for $1.5 million, the seller would accumulate $3 million more in 10 yearsby holding on to their business than selling now. The larger return comes from the accumulation of annualIDENTIFYING INDUSTRY TRENDS AND THEIR EFFECT ON EQUINE PRACTICE 136 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSprot and salary over the 10 years plus the ultimate sale. Even practices that have been offered 15 times EBITDA, can earn more money by selling in 10 years at a much lower multiple of EBITDA. Here is the uncomfortable question wehave to ask ourselves when a corporate aggregatorcomes knocking on our doors. If they are in thebusiness of making money, what about our prac-tices do they like? The simple answer is thatthey are buying low and selling high. It 'so b v i o u s that if someone is about to retire and can sell toone of these groups, they would be wise to takewhat is typically offered. But if their career hasa longer horizon, it is much more pro table to hold on and reap the rewards down the road. Oneshould ask, would you like $2,000,000 now or$5,000,000 in 10 years? Warren Buffet states\"Investing is laying out money now to get more money back in the future. \"If you own your own business, you just need to invest time to get moremoney in the future. Your business is workingfor you to maximize your investment. Just likerolling a snowball, it just keeps getting bigger andbigger. 5. Pros and Cons of Selling to a Consolidator Money is not the only reason why someone would sella practice. Many would value some of the manage-ment services a corporate group can offer or want thesecurity of knowing their retirement is assured. Let 's review some of the pros and cons of selling to a corpo-rate aggregator. Pros \u0081Ability to sell in the absence of internal prospects \u0081Administrative support with accounts receiv- ables and accounts payables \u0081Recruiting of new veterinarians and support staff \u0081Human resource support \u0081Marketing support \u0081Equipment purchasing support \u0081Peace of mind that the sellers can retire \u0081Potential bonus when shares held in overallgroup are sold Cons \u0081Reduced overall compensation if owners want to practice for more than 5 years \u0081Resistance of veterinarians to work for corpo- rate owners \u0081Lack of control over management Prices Equipment purchases Employee compensation \u0081Risk that performance targets are not met resulting in a reduced purchase price\u0081Potential new practice owners in 4-6 years \u0081Potential con flict of interest between patient care and nancial return to investors \u0081Potential loss if nal sale price is lower than expected 6. Conclusion Selling a veterinary practice is a major life event. Owning a practice refl ects many years of risk and sacri ce from building a practice, the long-term care given to clients and their horses, a sense of com- munity, and responsibility to all employees. Thepractice stands as a legacy of an owners 'dreams and ambitions. Selling to an outside corporate group is fraught with risks for both the seller and buyers. It is imperative that the seller recognize the businessmodel of the purchaser to ensure that they are com-patible with the legacy that is important with thesellers. The money received for the sale may ormay not be suf cient depending on the seller 's situation. It could be a lifeline for those at the end oft h ec a r e e ro ri n s u f cient for those who have a longer horizon. The main thing for all sellers to be aware ofis that the goals of the corporate groups are not neces-sarily the same as a veterinary practice. While it is important for an aggregator to treat the practices they purchase well, at the end of the day, they areultimately responsible to their investors. As veteri-narians, our goal is to care for our patients. Yes, weneed to be pro t a b l e ,b u ti ti s n 't the only thing. An i n v e s t o rw a n t st ob ek n o w nf o rc a r i n gf o rt h e i rp u r - chased practices, but their reputation and livelihood depends on ful lling the needs of their in- vestors. The trade off with selling to an aggrega-tor is that the selling practice owners can receivefairnancial compensation, but in return there is a loss of control. Ultimately, it is up to the sellerto be aware of the business model of the purchaserso that they can recognize the potential bene ts and disadvantages of working with the new own-ers and determine if the price offered is worth it, especially if the sellers want to continue practice for more than ve years.

Endocrine and metabolic disorders are frequent in donkeys, and when diagnosed, the dis- ease process and complications (hyperlipemia, insulin dysregulation, obesity, endocrinopathic lami- nitis) are often advanced. In donkeys suspected of insulin dysregulation with equivocal insulin concentrations, dynamic testing may be indicated, taking into consideration donkey-speci c values. Basal adrenocorticotropic hormone and the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation test are the preferred methods to diagnose pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) in donkeys. Pergolide is an effective treatment for PPID in donkeys. Donkeys have faster metabolic rates and higher cellular water content than horses, which may contribute to their ability to metabolize many drugs differently than horses. Extrapolation of doses and dosing intervals from horses to donkeysand mules could be ineffective or lead to side effects. For most drugs used in equine practice, donkeys and mules need higher doses and/or more frequent dosing intervals than horses. Other drugs (e.g., fluoroquinolones, pergolide) have longer half-lives, requiring lower doses or longer dosing intervals.

The don-key and mule were central to the development ofcountries such as the United States as well as manyothers in Europe and Asia. With industrialization,the use of these animals for economic development decreased to the point that they became secondaryand, over time, even irrelevant. Uses such asrecreational activities, ecotourism, hippotherapy/ono- therapy, as well as companion animals have beenincreasing in recent decades, mainly in developed countries. 1T h ed o n k e yc o n t i n u e st ob eav a l u a b l e asset in developing countries, where the livelihood of many families and local economies depend on theseanimals.

Therefore, there is a need to increase donkey- and mule-speci c knowledge in vet- erinarians and professionals involved with their use and care. Veterinarians practicing in this speciesshould be familiar with anatomical, physiological, en-docrine, and pharmacological differences consideringthat data extrapolation from horses can lead to mis-diagnosis, inadequate treatments, complications, unnecessary expenses, and, in some instances, even death. 1,4-6 2. Endocrinology Hyperlipemia Hyperlipemia refers to the ated with increased triglyceride concentrations (hy- perlipidemia).1,7Hyperlipemia is more frequent in donkeys than other equids, and it seems its higherincidence is a consequence of their ef ciency to store lipids and rapid ability to mobilize fat stores. 1It is more frequent in older donkeys, jennies, and smallerdonkey breeds. 1,7,8Hyperlipemia is not restricted to donkeys with obesity and insulin dysregulation (ID)because it occurs in donkeys of any age and in good or poor body condition, as well as in donkey foals. Aswith other equids, predisposing factors include condi-tions associated with a negative energy balance (e.g.,anorexia, fasting), increased energy demands (e.g.,late pregnancy, lactation), and stress, endotoxemia, parasitism, liver disease,gastrointestinal disease, laminitis). 1,7,8Obesity, stress, and pregnancy are major risk factors for hyper- lipemia in donkeys. Mortality rates in affected don- keys can be up to 80%, which are similar to poniesand miniature horses.1,7,8 Physiologic or pathologic processes that increase energy demands activate hormone-sensitive lipase inadipocytes to induce lipolysis and the release of freefatty acids (FFA) into circulation. 1In the liver, FFA are re-esteri ed into triglycerides, which are released as very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) into systemiccirculation. If will ensue, resulting in hepatic fatty in ltration, liver dysfunction, and increased risk of liver rupture. In severe hyperlipe- mia, other organs (kidneys, pancreas, heart, intes-tines, skeletal muscle) can be in ltrated by triglycerides, compromising their function (Fig. 1). 1,7,9 Catecholamines, glucocorticoids, adrenocorticotro- pic a) increase lipolysis, while insulin inhibits lipolysis and Fig. 1. Diagram of the pathophysiology of hyperlipemia. Physiological needs and pathological processes promote of lipolytic glucocorticoids, adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH], growth and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF a]) or reduced levels of lipogenic factors (insulin) leading to the release of free fatty acids (FFA) into circulation. Adipocyte lipolysis is mediated by lipase [HSL]. FFA are used as a source ofenergy, and the excess is re-esteri ed in the liver into triglycerides (TGL) that are released into circulation as part of very-low-den- sity lipoproteins (VLDL) to be taken by different tissues and used for energy, storage, or other functions. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in the capillaries removes TGL from VLDL to be transferred to cells. Glucocorticoids, GH, TNF a, and azotemia interfere with LPL, reducing TGL removal with subsequent VLDL accumulation in blood (hyperlipidemia). VLDL in high concentrations can in ltrate organs and impair their function.

Increased concentrations of li- polytic factors (cytokines, hormones), decreased lipo- genic hormones (insulin), and insulin insensitivity combined with reduced VLDL removal will ultimatelylead to hypertriglyceridemia and clinical hyperlipemia(Fig. 1). Insulin is the main lipogenic hormone, andimpaired signaling indirectly facilitates hyperlipemia,particularly in animals with metabolic syndrome andobesity. Hyperlipemia is usually secondary to otherconditions, and initial clinical signs are the result ofthe primary condition. 1,7-9In fact, hyperlipemia often goes unnoticed. Lethargy and anorexia are commonndings of hyperlipemia. Fatty in ltration of vari- ous organs leading to dysfunction can exacerbate dis-ease progression, additional clinical signs (e.g.,diarrhea, dysrhythmias), and laboratory abnormal-ities (e.g., increased liver enzymes, azotemia, (> 500 mg/dL [5.65 mmol/L]; there could be fatty in l- tration in various organs). Severe hyperlipemia is evi-dent when triglyceride concentrations are > 1000 mg/dL [11.3 mmol/L]. Gross lipemia can be noted with tri-glyceride concentrations > 500 mg/dL in sitting ethyle-nediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and serumtubes. However, these cutoff values are somehow arbi-trary, are mainly used in ponies, and may not apply todonkeys. In donkeys, lipemia may become grossly evi-dent at higher triglyceride concentrations than poniesand horses, likely due to a different lipid pro le. a Lipemic serum may interfere with the measurement ofvarious chemistry analytes, falsely changing their val-ues (e.g., pseudohyponatremia). The therapeutic prin-ciples for hyperlipemia are aimed at halting fatmobilization, controlling the primary disease, reducing hepatic triglyceride synthesis, avoiding stressful condi- tions, and restoring a positive energy balance. 1In pregnant animals, it is essential to provide a balancedcaloric intake, although excessive calories can predis-pose to otherdisorders (e.g., insulin dysregulation). Inextremesituations, pregnancy termination animals, early weaning ishighly recommended. Hyperlipemic donkeys shouldbe encouraged to eat by offering a variety of palatablefoodstuff that may stimulate hunger (e.g., honey,apples, carrots). Placing a feeding tube should beconsidered if gastrointestinal function is normal.Intravenous dextrose may be necessary to reducelipolysis. Partial parenteral nutrition without lipidsmay be required in some animals. 1,10If hyperglycemia persists or triglyceride concentrations continue toincrease over 24 h, regular insulin (0.05- 0.1 IU/kg/h, IV) or slow-release insulin (0.10 -0.15 IU/kg, q 12- 24 h, SQ) should be considered.1,10In donkeys where insulin proves effective, a continuous rate infusion (0.05 IU/kg/h starting rate) together with intravenous dextrose canbe implemented. Close glucose monitoring is essentialto avoid The bene ts of heparin or lowmolecular weight heparin to increase lipoprotein lipase remain to be evaluated. These products should be used with caution in animals with liver dysfunction dueto their increased risk of bleeding. Donkey Metabolic Syndrome Donkey metabolic syndrome (DMS) was recently rec-o g n i z e da n da p p e a r st ob eh i g h l yp r e v a l e n ti nd o n -keys, particularly in developed countries or where foodis readily available. 1DMS shares key features with equine metabolic syndrome (EMS), including obesity,ID, and endocrinopathic laminitis.11Clinical signs reported in horses such as reproductive disturbances,diabetes mellitus, and pancreatic insuf ciency are poorly characterized in donkeys. Similar to horsesand ponies, not every obese donkey has ID, and leananimals can be affected. The incidence is higher in jennies and middle-aged to old donkeys (> 8 years of age); 1however, this condition can be seen in much younger donkeys. Multiple factors likely contribute to the pathogenesis of ID and endocrinopathic laminitis in donkeys. Their energy ef ciency associated with reduced physical activity results in obesity, which is a major complicating factor for these disorders. In addi- tion to excessive body weight, adipose tissue produceshormones and cytokines that interfere with insulin sig-naling and promote a systemic pro-in flammatory state. 12Inflammatory prolonged hy- perinsulinemia disrupt lamellar cell function, whichtogether with excessive body weight contribute to the development of endocrinopathic laminitis. In- sulin concentrations are often elevated in obesedonkeys. 13Insulin insensitivity interferes glu- andalters endothelial integrity. Cytokines also reduce in-sulin worsening hepatic fattyinltration. Adipocyte factors (adipokines) such as leptin and adiponectin to the pathoge-nesis of ID and endocrinopathic laminitis. Thediagnostic principles of EMS also apply to DMS. Donkey-speci c body condition score systems have been developed, 14,15ranging from 1 (very thin) to 5 (obese)14or from 1 (emaciated) to 9 (obese).15A neck score system was also developed (0 = thin neck without pal-pable crest; 4 = thick neck, rounded andgross cresty).16Fasting glucose and insulin concen- trations as well as dynamic tests are the main meth-ods used to diagnose ID in donkeys. Factors thatcould interfere with the diagnosis of ID include stress,fasting time, carbohydrate-rich diets, physical activity, pain, transport, endocrinopathies (pituitary dysfunction [PPID]), concomitant diseases, and a2-adrenoreceptor agonists.11,17 -19Fasting insulin concentration is the main test used to diagnose ID inhorses, with a cutoff value of > 50 mIU/mL suggestive of ID.17Insulin concentrations differ between assays, and extrapolation can be misleading. Dynamic testsshould be considered when baseline insulin results areinconclusive (20 -50mIU/mL). Dynamic protocols have been evaluated in donkeys, demonstrating differ- ences with horses for the intravenous glucoseIN-DEPTH: ADVANCES IN DONKEY AND MULE MEDICINE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 141tolerance test (IVGTT) and the combined glucose-insu- lin test.20For the IVGTT, glucose (300 mg/kg, 50% dextrose solution) is administered IV as a bolus, andglucose and insulin concentrations are measured at 0(baseline), 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 150, 180,210, 240, and 300 minutes. In insulin-sensitive don-keys, glucose should be back to the normal range by180 minutes. This test is time-consuming. For thecombined glucose-insulin test, glucose (150 mg/kg, IV)is administered as a bolus and immediately followedby regular human insulin (0.1 IU/kg, IV). Glucoseand insulin concentrations are determined at thesame time points as the IVGTT. While horses areconsidered ID if glucose concentrations are above base-line at 45 minutes, donkeys would be considered ID ifglucose concentrations are at or above baseline at60 minutes. The test can be simpli ed by collecting blood samples at baseline and at 60 minutes. A se-rum insulin concentration of > 100 mIU/mL at 60 minutes also supports ID. The intravenous insu- lin tolerance test and frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGTT) have also been inves-t i g a t e di nh e a l t h ya n do b e s ed o n k e y s .1,21FSIGTT results are comparable between donkeys andhorses.21The FSIGTT is not a practical test, and its main use is in research. Oral carbohydrate tolerancetests, whether using dextrose or corn syrup, remain tobe evaluated in donkeys, but dynamics likely differbetween species. Leptin and adiponectin cutoff val-ues for donkeys with evidence of ID and endocrino-pathic laminitis have not been reported. Therapeuticapproaches for DMS have not been established, andclinicians rely on protocols for EMS. They arefocused on promoting weight loss, improving insulinregulation, and controlling signs of endocrinopathiclaminitis. To promote weight loss, caloric restrictionsand increased physical activity are central tosuccess. Due to their energy ef ciency and ability to subsist on poor quality feedstuffs, dietary manage-ment should rely on low-quality hay and eliminationof access to grain, concentrates, and carbohydrate-richpastures. Commercial diets to manage ID and obe-sity in horses may not be appropriate fordonkeys. Access to paddocks to promote physical ac-tivity is encouraged. Grazing should be avoided inearly morning or after rainfall. Grazing muzzlesmay be used with caution, and some clinicians avoidtheir use in donkeys because of concerns of inducingstress, which could trigger additional problems. Thepresence of other animals (donkeys, horses, goats) isrecommended to reduce stress and promote physicalactivity. Weight loss in donkeys must be a very slowprocess due to risk of other conditions such ashyperlipemia. Information on the pharmacology ofd r u g st om a n a g eI Do ro b e s i t yi nd o n k e y si sl a c k i n g ,and equine doses are generally used. Levothyroxinesodium is used in donkeys at equine doses (0.1 mg/kg, q24h, PO). Metformin has not been evaluated in donkeys, but it is occasionally administered (15 - 30 mg/kg, q12h, PO). Thiazolidinediones (pioglita-zone) and sulfonylureas (glyburide) in donkeys. Considering the clinical bene- ts of these and other drugs to manage energy dysre- gulation in other species, including horses, 18 evaluating their pharmacologic properties in donkeyswould be valuable. Pituitary Pars Intermedia Dysfunction PPID is common in geriatric donkeys, partly due to their longevity. The condition is often underdiagnosed,and epidemiological studies are lacking.1Breed and gender do not appear to be risk factors.1The pathoge- nesis of PPID in donkeys and mules is likely similar tohorses and ponies,1,13,22but mechanistic data are lacking. Clinical signs are similar between donkeys, horses, and ponies, with hypertrichosis being common. It is important to note that some donkeybreeds have long haircoats. Lethargy could be over- looked due to their calm behavior. Laminitis is a con- sistent nding in donkeys with PPID.22,23Hyper- hidrosis, ID, abnormal fat distribution (supraorbital, neck, shoulder, tail base), muscle wasting, reproductive problems, predisposition to infections, endoparas-itism, and orthopedic problems also occur in donkeys.1Polyuria is infrequent. Information on PPID in mules is minimal. Baseline ACTH concen- trations and the TRH stimulation test are the maindiagnostic tests for PPID diagnosis in donkeys.1,13 ACTH concentrations in healthy donkeys are higherthan in healthy horses and mules.13Similar to horses, donkeys exhibit seasonal variations in ACTH concentrations that should be taken into consideration when measuring baseline ACTH concentrations orperforming the TRH stimulation test.24Donkeys and mules have variations ACTH (donkeys: -October = = 5.0- 5 5 . 4 p g / m l ;m u l e s :A u g u s t - October = 9.8- 68.7 pg/ml; November -July = 5- 37.1 pg/ higher plasma ACTH values in t h ef a l lc o m p a r e dt oh o r s e s .25Basal cortisol concen- trations are similar in healthy donkeys and horses. Similar to horses, hypercortisolemia is a rarending in donkeys with PPID. Blood samples to measure ACTH should be collected in EDTA tubes, processed rapidly, and shipped on ice. The ACTH chemiluminescent immunoassaybworks well with donkey samples.13I ti si m p o r t a n tt ot a k ei n t oc o n - sideration stressful conditions and drugs (e.g., a2-ad- renoreceptor agonists, glucocorticoids) that could alterACTH concentrations. The dexamethasone-suppres-sion test and the combined dexamethasone-TRH test are not reliable methods in donkeys. 13,26,27For the TRH stimulation test, a donkey is considered PPID positive if plasma ACTH concentrations are higher than 110 pg/mL 10 minutes after injecting 1 mg of TRH intravenously.13It is important to note that this study had a small number of animals, and a large population of donkeys would necessary to further vali- date these values. Pergolide, a dopamine (D2) recep-tor agonist, is the drug of choice to treat PPID indonkeys. The pharmacokinetics of pergolide differs between donkeys and horses. 28After repeated dosing,IN-DEPTH: ADVANCES IN DONKEY AND MULE MEDICINE 142 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSpergolide achieves higher plasma concentrations in donkeys, indicating that lower doses may be suf cient to ameliorate the signs of PPID in donkeys.28However, pharmacodynamic information is lacking, and donkeysare typically treated with 0.25 to 0.5 mg/250 kg, q24h,PO often with clinical improve-ment. It is recom- mended to monitor animals early in treatment for potential side effects. In animals with anorexia, the dose should be reduced or discontinued. Bromocriptine, another dopamine D2 receptoragonist, and cyproheptadine, a 5-HT receptor an- tagonist, have not been evaluated in this species. Repeated measurements of basal ACTHconcentrations may be necessary to assess response to treatment and adjust dosing. Thyroid Gland Information on thyroid diseases in donkeys is lacking. Donkeys have higher plasma-free and total triiodothyronine (fT3, tT3), concentrations thanvalues reported for horses.29-31No gender differen- ces for thyroid hormones have been documented indonkeys. Similar to horses, young donkeys have higher fT4, tT4, and rT3 concentrations. 31Drugs such as phenylbutazone and dexamethasone reduce thyroid hormone (TH) concentrations in horses;32,33 however, their effects on asinine thyroid functionhave not been investigated. Their use could poten-tially lead to a misdiagnosis of hypothyroidism. Parathyroid Gland Serum total calcium, total magnesium, and phospho- rus concentrations in donkeys are within the refer- ence range of values reported for horses. One study found higher ionized calcium, complexed magnesium, and calcitriol concentrations but lower parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations and protein-bound magnesium in donkeys compared to horses.34 Nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism may be seen in donkeys consuming diets with low calcium or high phosphorus content35but also occurs with the ingestion of oxalate-rich plants.36Clinical signs (fa- cial swelling, lameness, upper airway stridor, andneurological signs), diagnosis, and treatment are simi-lar to horses. 3. Pharmacology Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) Most NSAIDs used in horses are metabolized faster in donkeys.37-49Therefore, for many of these drugs to reach therapeutic levels, either the dose or dosing fre- quency will have to be increased.37Phenylbutazone m e a nr e s i d e n c et i m e( M R T )i ss h o r t e ra n dc l e a r a n c e is faster in donkeys compared to horses.42,44 Miniature donkeys clear phenylbutazone even faster than average sized donkeys.44Miniature donkeys will need more frequent dosing as higher doses couldpotentially lead to renal and gastrointestinalinjury. Flunixin meglumine area under the curve (AUC) and MRT were lower, but clearance was higher in donkeys compared to horses. 39,45Flunixin meglu- mine appears to have faster tissue penetration in don- keys than horses.37,50,51Flunixin meglumine has less side effects than phenylbutazone.45Meloxicam, ro- coxib, and cimicoxib are selective COX-2 inhibitorswith lower AUC and MRT, shorter half-life, and faster clearance in donkeys compared to horses.37,41,52,53 This indicates that more frequent dosing will berequired to achieve adequate analgesia with these drugs. Meloxicam reduces the systemic infl amma- tory response from endotoxemia in donkeys54and could be a safer alternative to flunixin meg- lumine. In contrast to most NSAIDs, intravenous slower clearance and larger AUC indonkeys,43while intravenous ketoprofen has faster meglumine, NSAID pharmacokinetic studies inmules are lacking. Sedatives, Analgesics, and Anesthetics Donkeys and mules are considered stoic animals, and their response to pain may be subtle or go unnoticed, which could have negative consequences (e.g.,hyperlipemia, laminitis). For this reason, anal-gesia is very important to ameliorate the pain- stress cycle. Sedatives and tranquilizers used in horses are routinely administered to donkeys andm u l e s . T h ed o s eo f a2-adrenoreceptor agonists (e.g., xylazine) often needs to be increased by 50%t h ee q u i n ed o s ei nm u l e s ,m i n i a t u r ed o n k e y s ,a n dferal or excited animals. 37The analgesic effect of xylazine is similar between donkeys and horses.55 However, analgesia from xylazine is less intenseand of shorter duration than for detomidine andromidine. 56For these reasons, detomidine and romidine have been proposed as better options for pain management in donkeys.56Ace- promazine provides satisfactory tranquilization in donkeys,57although some donkeys may require twice the acepromazine dose used in horses to achieve good tranquilization. Acepromazine is not an effective analgesic.57Butorphanol also enhances t h es e d a t i v ea n dh y p o a l g e s i ce f f e c t so f a2-adrenorecep- tor agonists in donkeys.58Tramadol is an effective analgesic in donkeys.59Transdermal fentanyl patches provide good pain relief in donkeys.60 Metamizole (dipyrone) has a shorter half-life in don- keys than horses.38In donkeys, ketamine has a shorter half-life and faster clearance than in mules andhorses.61Guaifenesin (glyceryl guaiacolate) has a lon- ger half-life in donkeys than horses, and recovery time could be prolonged, requiring close supervision in donkeys.62Intravenous propofol is a safe option for anesthesia induction and maintenance.62Propofol can be combined with ketamine to lower the dose, andthis combination produces longer anesthesia time, bet-ter muscle relaxation, and smoother recoveries thanketamine alone. 63By reducing the dose, the propofol and ketamine or guaifenesin, ketamine, and xylazineIN-DEPTH: ADVANCES IN DONKEY AND MULE MEDICINE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 143combinations can be used to maintain anesthesia in donkeys.63,64 Thiopental is a good induction agent in donkeys and mules but is rarely used.63Induction time is faster with thiopental, but recovery is quicker and bet-ter with propofol.65Alfaxalone with midazolam time to induction is faster compared to ketamine and mida-zolam, but recovery time is shorter with the ketamineand midazolam combination. 66Induction and recov- ery with either combination is acceptable after seda-tion with xylazine.66The combination xylazine, diazepam, and ketamine is effective and safe in don-keys and mules.63Inhaled anesthetics such as halo- thane, iso flurane, or sevofl have similar properties donkeys and horses.37Epidural lido- caine provides good regional analgesia to donkeys, butmorphine is less effective.37Local anesthetics are used in a similar manner and appear to be equallyeffective in donkeys, mules, and horses. Antimicrobials Similar to NSAIDs, compared to horses, donkeys and mules have a faster metabolism for a number of anti- microbial drugs, with faster clearances, lower MRTs, and shorter half-lives.37,49For most antimicrobials, donkeys and mules require higher doses or shorterdosing intervals.37,49Aminoglycosides (amikacin and gentamicin) have similar (enro floxa- cin and marbo floxacin) are cleared slower in donkeys, and once-a-day dosing interval is preferred.47For many other antimicrobials used in equine practice,information in donkeys and mules is lacking but nec-essary for better treatments. In addition to appropri- ate criteria for antimicrobial selection in donkeys is the implementation of antimicrobial stewardship practices to reduce bacterial resistance. Similar to other equids, donkeys are susceptible to the toxiceffects of ionophores. Antiparasitic Drugs Caution must be macrocyclic lac- tones (ivermectin, moxidectin, abamectin, eprinomec- tin) in donkeys, particularly those in poor body condition due to the higher risk of neurotoxicity com- pared to horses.37Imidocarb dipropionate is an effective treatment for piroplasmosis. Of interest,donkeys and mules are overly sensitive to this drug,and hepatic side effects can be observed. 67Doses for donkeys and mules should be lower than forhorses. Imidocarb dipropionate toxicity results from acetylcholinesterase mide minutes prior to imido- carb administration is recommended. 37Fenbendazole is a benzimidazole commonly used against strongyles in horses, donkeys, and mules. Oral fenbendazole is notvery effective at eliminating lungworms in donkeys and horses.40Moxidectin (400 mg/kg, PO) is the treatment of choice for lungworms in donkeys.37Pyrantel pamoatein paste and granule formulations have poor intestinal absorption in donkeys but good ef cacy (> 95%) against intestinal strongylidae. Psoroptic and similar horses (pyrethroids, sulfur, ivermectin, moxidectin, eprinomectin). Other Drugs Prokinetic drugs such as lidocaine, metoclopramide, and cisapride are occasionally used in donkeys under protocols similar to horses, but pharmacological infor- mation, including ef cacy studies, is lacking. 4. Summary The evolution of the donkey occurred under environ- mentally harsh conditions, leading to adaptations for energy conservation, including the ability to digest poor-quality feedstuff, a unique capacity to accumulate adipose tissue, and ef cient fat mobilization under increased energy demands or food scarcity. These fea-tures also predispose donkeys to obesity, dyslipidemias, insulin metabolic diseases are fre- quent in donkeys. Differences in hormone dynamics and testing protocols for endocrinopathies between donkeys and horses support species-speci c approaches for appropriate diagnosis and treatment. In addition,donkeys and mules have distinct pharmacological fea- tures leading to differences in the way they metabolize and respond to drugs used in equine practice. Most of these drugs work well and are safe for donkeys and mules; however, some when used under equine proto- cols can lead to subdosing, overdosing, toxicities, and even death. Therefore, a basic knowledge of drugs used in horses, donkeys, and mules is important.

Introduction To appreciate the clinical importance of objective pa- rameters for assessing donkey and mule health, suchas established reference intervals (RIs) for hemato- logic and serum biochemistry values, one must rst understand the behavior of equids. Donkeys andtheir hybrid counterparts, namely, mules and hinnies, pose unique challenges to the veterinarian due totheir subtle expressions of pain and illness as com- pared to horses. 1It is imperative that veterinarians rely heavily on history provided by observant care- takers or owners to determine when a donkey or mule is in need of veterinary care. Very slight changes in behavior, such as a donkey or mule not coming up to feed as readily, not spending as much time with the group or a pasture-mate, or lying down more fre-quently or at unusual times, may be the only signals that the equid is unwell.1,2In fact, typical colic signs seen in a donkey may contrast very sharply to those seen in a horse, and even severe forms of colic may only result in dullness, isolation, reduced appetite (and sometimes sham eating), or recumbency.3Other subtle pain behaviors in don- keys can be detected by astute observation of ear posi- tion, eye and nostril shape, and tension, as well as head, neck, and tail movement.4,5D u et ot h e i r innate ability to conceal signs of discomfort, or todisplay them in a more subtle manner than horses, it is imperative that objective means to assess thehealth status of equids is used whenever possible.Physiologic parameters should be assessed as part ofevery physical examination, including heart rate, re-spiratory rate, gastrointestinal sounds, and bodytemperature. These ndings should be interpreted with donkey- and mule-speci c intervals in mind, as they differ from those of horses. 4Subjective ndings should then be combined with objective means ofassessing the health status of the equid, such as clini-cal pathology parameters, which are exceedingly im- portant in light of their stoic nature. 2. Sample Collection and Storage Although not speci c to donkeys, the results of diag- nostic tests are directly affected by the quality and the integrity of the samples collected, stored, and submit-ted to the diagnostic lab. All of the steps taken fromthe point of diagnostic sample collection to the analy-sis are classi ed broadly as the preanalytical phase of clinical pathology. 6Several biological and nonbiolog- ical preanalytical factors can have effects on hemato-logic values. In human hematology testing,preanalytical factors account for 50% to 75% of theerrors seen. 7Biological components, which are often NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 147IN-DEPTH: ADVANCES IN DONKEY AND MULE MEDICINEout of our control, may include the in fluence of spe- cies, breed, age, environmental factors and geographi- cal location, animal handling, physical activity, nutrition, body condition, physiologic state, concur-rent disease processes, and exposures to exogenouscompounds (e.g., medications and toxins). 8It is im- perative to document any of these factors that areknown and include that information in the historyprovided to the diagnostic lab where the testing willtake place, as they can have profound effects on thenal diagnostic report and interpretation of the test results. Also, several technical factors can affect clin-ical pathology test results, including a host of nonbio-logical preanalytical factors associated with samplecollection, handling, and storage. For instance, ll- ing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) bloodtubes to maintain an ideal ratio between anticoagu-lant and blood is an important consideration. If anEDTA tube is not lled to the appropriate level, excess EDTA can result in red blood cell (RBC) shrinkage, falsely decreasing the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and increasing the mean corpuscular hemoglo-bin concentration (MCHC). 6Also, clots or microclots may form within the blood tube if it is not properlyadmixed by gentle inversion of the tube immediatelyafter blood collection. These clots can cause errors inthe hematology results and can also clog automatedanalyzer equipment. 6Storage temperature and time to analysis can also have signi cant effects on hema- tology values. Although the effects of sample storagetime and temperature on all hematology analytesacross all species are not available, at least one studyfound that donkey blood should be analyzed within12 hours of collection, with storage at 4\u00b0C, becausestorage for greater than 24 hours and at 24\u00b0C or morecan cause pseudotoxic changes. 9If shipment to a laboratory is required, the EDTA-whole blood sampleshould be sent in an insulated box with a frozen ice pack. Including 2 -3 air-dried, unstained, blood smears prepared using the EDTA blood sample is always bene cial because cellular changes may other- wise alter the results.8The slides should be pack- aged carefully in a sturdy slide mailer and protectedfrom direct exposure to ice packs, which can otherwiseresult in condensation and cell lysis. Because manyof the world' s donkeys are located in hot, remote areas that are not favorable for sample integrity, payingparticular attention to sample handling for clinical pa-thology assays of these equids is exceedinglyimportant. Serum or heparin plasma may be usedfor biochemical analysis, although they can each beexpected to result in some predictable differenceswhen speci c analytes such as potassium, phosphate, lactate dehydrogenase, protein, and globulin aremeasured. 7Heparin tubes may be advised for use when expedited analysis is required, as they can becentrifuged and analyzed immediately, rather than waiting for clot formation, as is the case when analyz- ing serum from a red-top blood tube. Similar lling and inverting measures should be taken when usingheparin tubes as described above for EDTA tubes.The serum or plasma should be separated from the cells as soon as possible (ideally within 2 hours of col- lection) to avoid preanalytical errors. Likewise, when serum separator atubes are used, the serum should still promptly be removed and placed in a separateplain tube. Importantly, because the appearance of each (once separated) is otherwise indistinguishable,they must be labeled appropriately for an accurate interpretation of the results (heparinized plasma ver- sus serum). The separated serum or plasma can be maintained at refrigeration temperatures for about 48 hours or frozen at /C020\u00b0C for longer storage. If shipment to a laboratory is required, samples shouldbe packed carefully in an insulated box with frozen ice packs for overnight delivery. 3. Analysis and Interpretation To use objective clinical pathology assays for deter- mining the health status of an equid, knowledge of the parameters that are considered normal for the species of interest must be relied upon. This requiresthe use of population-based RIs that best represent the animal in question. It is important to remember that equipment and procedures vary among laborato- ries, so results obtained from the patient in question must be compared to those from other studies with extreme caution. It is best practice for a laboratory to develop RIs for speci c populations being tested, following American Society of Veterinary Clinical Pathology (ASVCP) guidelines.10When this is not possible due to the population of interest being toosmall or resources being limited, ASVCP also provides guidelines for transference validation of established RIs to the population of interest. The wide array of donkey breeds, the low numbers of donkeys withinmost of those breed categories, and the typically harsh environments where many donkeys and mules reside have made the generation of accurate clinical pathol- ogy RIs for equids extremely challenging. Literature focused speci cally on clinical pathology values of mules and hinnies is rare. The authors are aware ofone study that compared hematologic and biochemical values of healthy mules, hinnies, horses, and donkeys, but more studies involving larger populations ofhybrids are critically important. 4Donkey studies are slightly more numerous but often include lownumbers, speci c breeds, or donkeys from very spe- cic geographic regions or in certain physiologic states, which may not provide the most accurate RIs for the clinician wishing to assess the health status of a domestic donkey encountered in private practice inthe United States. 8Also, many studies lack descrip- tions of procedural details, such as timeframe fromspecimen collection to serum separation or validation information necessary to con dently extrapolate the results to the patient. In addition, the lack of widelyavailable RIs for donkeys and mules often means that many veterinarians turn to RIs established for horsesas a substitute, which can lead to erroneous diagnoses due to many physiological disparities between the 148 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: ADVANCES IN DONKEY AND MULE MEDICINETable 1.

Parameters of Particular Interest to Equid Health Some key analytes stand out as particularly impor- tant in the context of sick, inappetent equids due to their propensity for developing metabolic disease and hyperlipidemia. Serum triglyceride concentrationsare most often used as an aid in diagnosing hyperlip- idemia in equids. This can be dif cult, though, due to discrepancies in the RI for this parameter acrossvarious studies, likely due to variation across donkey breeds as well as effects of environment, nutrition, body mass index, neck score, and management factors on this measurement. 8, 16Cholesterol concentration may also aid in the diagnosis of hyperlipidemia but,similar to triglyceride concentrations, shows wide var-iability across studies (Table 1). 8Similar to equine metabolic syndrome, donkey or asinine metabolic syn-drome is linked to insulin dysregulation (ID), recur- rent bouts of laminitis, and obesity. 17As with those analytes used to diagnose hyperlipidemia, diagnosingID relies on metabolic parameters that vary widely across sex, age, and study. Basal insulin concentra-tions and dynamic tests may be useful, but the inter-pretation of results is dif cult. There is evidence to suggest that donkeys with ID often have higherplasma insulin concentrations than horses withID. 17M e a s u r e m e n t so fg l u c o s et oa i di nt h ed i a g n o - sis of ID must be cautiously interpreted because pub- lished donkey glucose RIs are highly variable, likely due to the sensitivity of that parameter to manage-ment practices, stress in the donkey, and preanalyti-cal effects. 8In addition, when a dynamic test is applied to a donkey for the purposes of identifying ID, donkey-speci c protocols should be followed to arrive at the most accurate diagnosis.17,18Importantly, donkeys should not be fasted for testing. Rather, a flake of hay should be provided to the donkey the night before the dynamic metabolic test (and the testshould be performed in the morning) to minimize therisk of hyperlipidemia. 18In addition, interpretation of both the intravenous glucose tolerance test and thecombined glucose-insulin test requires knowledge of the fact that the glucose curves are right-shifted for donkeys when compared with horses.18Mendoza et al18summarizes the protocols and the timing required for each but also clearly states that insulin cut-off val- ues have not yet been established for donkeys with these diagnostic protocols. Future work is needed toevaluate the use of the oral glucose tolerance test byusing corn syrup in donkeys. Additional work to fur- ther de ne donkey and mule clinical pathology values indicative of disease states for other samples, such as body cavity fluids, respiratory system samples, and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), is needed. One study evaluating serum and CSF from the lumbosacral space in 20 clinically normal miniature donkeys obtained results similar to those of horses for the ana-lytes measured. 19A couple of recent studies have highlighted relevant differences in coagulation testing between donkeys and horses.20,21One of those stud- ies found that both activated partial thromboplastinTable 2. Comparison of Coagulation Parameters from Healthy Donkey and Horse Populations ParameterAndalusian Donkeys (Mendoza et al20) 11.2 60.8 (10.8 -11.6) Activated partial thromboplastin (seconds) (23.2 PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 159IN-DEPTH: ADVANCES IN DONKEY AND MULE MEDICINEand prothrombin time were signi cantly shorter in the donkey than the horse, suggesting that the use of horse RIs may lead to the underdiagnosis of coagulo- pathies in donkeys.20Some of the pertinent coagula- tion values from those two studies are summarized in Table 2.20,21 5. Conclusions Donkeys, mules, and hinnies prove time and again that they differ signi cantly from horses in their anat- omy, behavior, nutritional requirements, pharmacoki- netics, and much more.1,15,22With the most current literature highlighting these important distinctions, itis not surprising to learn that the limited donkey- andhybrid-speci c clinical pathology studies likewise dem- onstrate differences across the species. 8,11Reliance on clinical pathology testing of equids in veterinarymedicine is exceedingly important due to their stoic nature and propensity to conceal ailments. For this reason, further work is necessary in this capacity toaid the veterinarian in elevating the health and wel- fare status of equids.

Introduction Donkeys are bred worldwide for a variety of uses. From the production standpoint, donkey milkhas become a delicacy particularly useful for infantsand those allergic to cow or goat milk and the cosmeticindustry. 1In Asia, the renewed interest in donkeys forejiao, a product of traditional Chinese medicine, has generated a higher demand for the production ofdonkeys.1However, in many countries, donkeys are bred primarily to produce hybrids with horses (i.e.,mules and hinnies).2Hybrid animals are used for agricultural work, pleasure, Western sports, andherding cattle worldwide.2In North and South America, mule showing and pleasure rides attractthousands of enthusiasts to speci c events such as the Mule Day at the Shawnee National Forest in Herod,Illinois, and Mule Days in Bishop, California.Production of mules for showing, pleasure riding, andracing are reasons practitioners are contacted to breedhorse mares with jack semen. In addition, practi-tioners are typically asked to breed seedstock jenniesin the American continent to obtain quality jacks, andless commonly for pets or conservation efforts.Donkeys are classi ed as miniature, small standard, standard, and large breeds. Therefore, it is para-mount that equine practitioners be prepared toprovide reproductive services for donkey and mule breeders. Thus, this manuscript discusses recent advances in donkey breeding management and theauthors 'clinical experiences with the species. 2. Female (Jenny) Features Estrous Cycle and Sexual Behavior The interovulatory interval is longer in donkeys (23 - 2 6d a y s )t h a ni nm a r e s( ;21 days; Table 1).2 Duration of the estrous cycle varies with breeds, body condition scores (BCS), geographical location, andtime of the year.2Estrus usually lasts about 6 days, but it varies from 4 to 10 days, and diestrus lasts from15 to 19.3-6Ovulation takes place 1 day before ceasing signs of estrus.7,8In the spring and summer, the estrus is shorter than in the fall and winter.6,9,10 Well-fed donkeys do not display seasonal anestrus;under tundra weather, some jennies experience oneprolonged interovulatory interval of 40 to 50 days dur-ing the deep winter and then resume regular intero-vulatory intervals. 2Also, a recent study described that older jennies display longer interovulatory inter-vals, a slower growth rate of the dominantfollicle. 6In addition, the BCS affects the duration of the interovulatory intervals.6Speci cally, higher BCS (>6/9) lengthened the interovulatory intervals NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 161IN-DEPTH: ADVANCES IN DONKEY AND MULE MEDICINEdue to longer diestrus; however, the follicle growth rate and the dominant follicle diameter were inde- pendent of the BCS in the same study.6Multiple ovulation was positively associated with BCS and hadno effect on the interovulatory interval.6Signs of estrus in jennies include standing to be mounted, alowered head with ears back against the neck, clitoralwinking, urination, mouth clapping, and tail raising(Fig. 1). 11It is worth noting that the mouth clapping is the most typical and also the rst and last estrus sign in jennies.12J e n n i e sk e p to np a s t u r e sw i l lc o n - gregate into a sexually active group similar tocows.11In the sexually active group, the female in estrus is mounted by other females coming in or out ofestrus. Inhaling urogenital secretions from oneanother followed by the Flehmen 's response is a typi- cal feature of sexually active groups. 11This jack-like behavior is a normal species-speci cb e h a v i o ri nj e n - nies, and it should not be confused with intersex andthose with granulosa-theca cell tumors;2jennies in diestrus typically do not stand to be mounted andmay kick at the jack.13 Folliculogenesis and Reproductive Hormones in Jennies Follicular deviation (i.e., diameter when the dominant follicle starts growing faster than subordinate follicles) occurs 8 to 9 days before ovulation at an approximately 18-mm follicle for small-frame breeds5 and;20 mm for large donkey or two follicular waves per estrous cycle.3,5,14In small-frame donkeys, the dominant fol- licle grows 2 to 3 mm/day from deviation to ovula-tion,5,6while in large donkey breeds, the dominantfollicle grows up to 4 mm/day.14Thus, the diameter of the periovulatory follicle seems to be associated with the jenny's body frame, and follicle size variesfrom 30 to 48 mm. 2Concentrations of estradiol-17 b increase from 10 pg/mL during early estrus to peakaround 40 to 60 pg/mL at 24 hours beforeovulation. After ovulation, progesterone concentra-tions slowly increase for 4 to 6 days, reaching a peak by 10 days and a plateau by 14 to 16 days postovulation. 2Luteolysis starts by 14 to 15 days postovulation, lasting up to 2 to 3 days for progester-one concentration to nadir ( <1n g / m L ;F i g .2 ) . Multiple ovulations seem to be higher in donkeysthan in mares; it varies from 5% to 70% studies. breeds have a inci- of multiple ovulations, such as the Portuguesebreed Miranda (48%), the Chinese black donkey Dezhou (13%), the Spanish breed Catalan (42%), and the American Mammoth (61%). 6,14The high inci- dence of multiple ovulations in donkeys makes a twinpregnancy more likely in jennies than in mares. 1At the same time, donkeys have an extremely ef cient placenta rendering a high probability for the deliveryof live twins. 2However, twin pregnancies have an increased risk for pregnancy loss, and live donkey twins are of a smaller frame and weaker than sin- gletons; also, there is a high risk of dystocia(authors' unpublished observations). Therefore, it is still advisable to perform manual reduction (as done in horses) by transrectally crushing one of the embryonic vesicles around 14 to 17 dayspostovulation. Fig. 1.

To safely perform this ex- amination, jennies can be restrained in horse stocks, placed in a doorway of a stall, or have a lip twitch placed and palpated with no minimal restraining (Fig. 3). Sedation is rarely necessary to palpate jen- nies. While the reproductive tract is proportionallylarger in jennies than mares, rectally palpating small- frame jennies can be challenging due to the reduced anus and rectum sizes.2In addition, some jennies may strain excessively during transrectal palpation and ultrasonography.1Lidocaine mixed with lubri- cant (20 mL of 2% lidocaine in 80 mL of carboxyme- thylcellulose) alone or in combination with N- butylscopolammonium bromide (10 -20 mg/animal, IV) may be necessary to safely and successfully per- form a transrectal examination in jennies.2Miniature donkeys cannot typically be palpated transrectally without signi cant risk for rectal tears.2The ultra- sonographic appearance of jennies' reproductive tract resembles mares '; however, jennies are well-known to present a less pronounced endometrial edema, partic- ularly in fat donkeys (Fig. 4).2Therefore, if the clini- cian waits to induce ovulation or breed jennies using the mare endometrial edema scores, ovulations will be missed.10,18Close to ovulation, the periovulatory follicle changes from spherical to an oval or ellipsoid shape, and the follicular wall becomes irregular and thicker.10,19,20Of interest, the vascularization beneath the follicular wall increases up to 24 hoursbefore ovulation (Fig. 5). After ovulation, jennies can present homogeneous appearance and two other dis- tinct corpus luteum (CL) appearances. Oneappearance has central hyperechoic line lead- ing up to luteolysis; the second morphologic type has a nonechogenic central lacuna that gradually reduces insize until luteolysis (Fig. 6). 10On the rst day of diestrus, the of CL 77% of preovula-tory follicle diameter.21The vascularization of the CL rises gradually until 4 to 6 days after ovulation,peaks around 11 days, and starts to decline 2 to 3 days after luteolysis (14-15 days postovulation; Fig. 7).12 Hormone Therapy for Jenny Estrus Cycle Manipulation Prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2 a)a n a l o g sc a nb eu s e d to bring jennies back to estrus.2Jennies typically return to estrus between 2 and 5 days after luteolyticagent administration (Table 2). Side effects such assweating, abdominal pain, and loose manure can be seen with all luteolytic drugs. For small-frame don- keys, dinoprost tromethamine should be reduced to2.5 mg to minimize the side effects caused by standard doses used in the horse (i.e., 5-7.5 mg). In general, luteolytic drugs are used > 5 days after ovulation;however, some authors suggest giving a luteolyticagent 3 days after ovulation, with the ef cacy varying from 17% to 100% (Table 2). 22,23,25The is to use dinoprost (2.5-5 mg) or cloproste-nol (0.075 mg) at least 5 days postovulation. Baudet du Poitou jennies may take up to 10 to 12 days to return into estrus after standard PGF2 aadministra- tion 5 days postovulation.aInduction of ovulation in jennies is typically carried out with The dose, route, size of the dominant follicle, and ovulation rates for each Fig. 3.

The ideal time for induction of ovulation in jennies varies with BCS,age, and body size. As previously described, jenniesdo not consistently present a marked endometrial pat-tern before ovulation as mares do (Fig. 4); 10,18there- fore, the endometrial pattern should not be considered Fig. 5.

Over time, there is an increase in an anechoic line (asterisks) beneath the follicular wall, a loss of the spherical shape, and development of the stigma (apical area with brackets), and a thickening of the granulosa layer (arrows) can be noticed upon impending ovulation.

Small stand-ard and standard jennies (300-400 lb body weight)can be induced to 40 mm,and larger breeds (500-800 du Poitou follicles are inducedwhen attaining 40 to 45 mm in diameter. aWell-fed animals tend to grow follicles more rapidly and ovu-late follicles with a smaller diameter for the expectedbody frame. Estrus Synchronization Protocols Hormones commonly administered to jennies to synchronize estrus include PGF2 a,15progester- one or progestin,15,28hCG, GnRH analogs 8).15,28,29Single or double doses of PGF2 a with 16-day intervals can be used. Administration ofGnRH 7 days before the rst PGF2 aensures ovula- tion, creating a CL that will be responsive to the second PGF2 aadministration.29Progesterone (in- travaginal device or intramuscular) coupled withPGF2 acan be used in jennies. Combining pro- gesterone with estrogen for 10 days provides bettersynchrony and synchronous ovulation in 73% (8/11) ofjennies; however, it is still not as ef cient as double PGF injections 16 days apart 15 Artificial Insemination Articial insemination (AI) in jennies is performed similarly to mares (Fig. 9).2However, jennies have a narrowed and tortuous cervix, with the vaginal por-tion of the cervix assuming variable appearance fromstraight to C, D, and V appearance. 2Thus, particu- larly for some jennies, trans-passing the cervix forroutine procedures can be a dauntingtask. 2In addition, some jennies present excessive straining during intravaginal procedures, and thereduced lumen of the vagina and vulva can furthercomplicate routine procedures. Thus, in this case,the authors may perform caudal epidural anesthesiawith 2 to 4 mL of lidocaine 2%. Alternatively, trans-cervical AI can be performed using Wilsher andAllen 's forceps described for the embryo transfer tech- nique (Fig. 10). 30A vaginal speculum is introduced, and the cervix is then grasped with the forceps andretracted caudally to facilitate the passage of the AIpipette through the cervix. This reduces the effects of manipulation and the risk of introducing contami- nation during AI. Semen can be deposited into theuterine body or guided to the uterine horn ipsilateralto the preovulatory follicle/ovulation. Deep-horn AIsare appropriated for small semen volumes (2-4 mL) toavoid re flux of semen, while larger volumes can be de- posited into the uterine body. Of interest, a highersperm dose should be used to breed jennies. Jenniesinseminated with at least 1 billion motile spermachieve similar pregnancy rates compared with maresinseminated with 500 million motile sperm. 31Overall, jennies and mares have satisfactory fertility whenbred with raw or freshly extended donkeysemen. 2Although frozen donkey semen typically presents excellent post-thaw quality and achieves sat-isfactory fertility rates in mares ( ;50%),32it does not necessarily translate into satisfactory fertility in Fig. 7.

The authors typically use 10 mg/jenny before or after breeding with frozen semen. Authorshave proposed uterine lavage and infusion with don-key seminal plasma (v:v, 1:2, frozen-thawed semen: seminal plasma). 36The addition of donkey seminal plasma seems to reduce the endometrial in flamma- tory response;38,39the authors suggested that post- thawed semen resuspended in seminal plasma tendedto increase the conception rates.36Seminal plasma reduces the postbreeding endometrial in flammatory response and the polymorphonuclear cells bound sperm.40A recent study concluded that donkey sem- inal plasma, not sperm-intrinsic factors, are able totrigger NETosis (the process that culminates in the release of neutrophil extracellular traps) in both a time- and sperm-concentration-dependent mannerand suggests that NETosis could represent a mecha- nism by which the female reproductive tract selects sperm. 41Uterine lavage after insemination (at least 4 hours after insemination) can also be used to mitigatethe postbreeding uterine reaction in jennies. The authors of the present report recommend that increas- ing the breeding dose coupled with deep horn insemi-nation and uterine lavage 4 to 6 hours after breedingcan be used to enhance pregnancy rates in jennies. A recent study out of China, utilizing a timed-AI proto- col to synchronize ovulation in jennies, obtained >70%of conception rate on deep horn insemination with fro- zen-thawed jack semen (500 /C210 6) at 28 and 40 hours after hormone (luteinizing hormone [LH] or hCG) injection.42This study warrants testing in practice to see if these results can be consistently achieved. Also, the LH used in that study is not available in the United States.

However, up to date, there are nostudies assessing the ef cacy of oxytocin in jennies. Guidelines for treating uterine fluid in jen- nies are currently lacking; however, the authors have used equine guidelines to determine when to flush jennies. For instance, jennies with a large amount of anechoic or moderate to large amount of intrauterinefluid accumulation (Fig. 11) are typically flushed with a crystalloid solution such as lactated Ringer 's solution. Pregnancy Diagnosis Although transrectal palpation can be used as a diag- nostic tool in jennies, this method requires experienceand skill for a reliable diagnosis, and feasibility is determined by the type and size of the jenny alongwith the stage of gestation. Therefore, pregnancy di- agnosis by transrectal ultrasonography minimizes the risk of false-negative diagnosis and aids in the identi- cation and management of twins. Pregnancy diag- nosis can be performed by transrectal ultrasono-g r a p h y9t o1 0d a y sp o s t o v u l a t i o n ,w h e nt h ee m b r y o vesicle is 2.3 61.1 mm in diameter (Fig. 12A); how- ever, the accuracy of detecting an embryonic vesicle pregnancy this early in gestation is only 25%. 43The rst pregnancy diagnosis is ideally performed between 12 and 15 days after ovulation when the em- bryonic vesicle measures between 6 62.3 mm 12B and C).43-45The early em- bryonic jennies in Table4.

By day 24 to 25 of pregnancy, an embryo heartbeat can be detected.45 3. Male (Jack) Features Jack Sexual Behavior and Semen Collection Jacks are generally regarded as challenging to collect semen using estrus jennies, mares, or a dummy mount.1,2,11Strategies to optimize semen collection are described elsewhere in details.11,46Except for a few high-libido donkeys, most jacks can take up to 60 minutes to collect semen or may not collect unless conditions are optimized.47Jacks are attracted to jennies, and some can be conditioned to mares;unfortunately, most mares are not receptive to jacks(60%), and several react violently to jacks during teas- ing or mounting. 11Thus, in mares not conditioned to jacks, the authors elect to sedate the mare heavilywith alpha-2-agonists, place breeding hobbles, and lip twitch (Fig. 13). Additionally, breeding stocks with or without a pit in the center can aid in restraining the mounting mare being used for live cover or semencollection (Fig. 13). 11,13Mares exposed to donkeys tend to become used to jacks, and after repeated uses,they become more receptive to them when in estrus.11Some jacks present extremely low libido in the presence of an estrus mare; patience and incorpo-rating mimicked elements of donkey courtship with jennies while working with mares can be extremelyhelpful. 11,13,46In equids, washing the penis immedi- ately before collection, particularly in sexually restedanimals, is paramount to decrease bacterial contami- nation and debris in semen. Teasing by proximity to t h et e a s e ro ra l l o w i n gt h ej a c kt oi n t e r a c tw i t ht h e mare or jenny should result in penile exposure and erection (Fig. 14). While washing, untrained Fig. 9. Arti cial insemination in a Baudet du Poitou jenny. Fig. 10. Transcervical AI of jenny using the Wilsher and Allen 's forceps to retract the cervix of a small -frame jenny.IN-DEPTH: ADVANCES IN DONKEY AND MULE MEDICINE 168 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSdonkeys can bene t from cleaning the penis with wet cotton rather than throwing water with a cup as water splashing might be enough negative stimuli fora donkey to lose an erection. 2Anecdotally, PGF2 sodium cloprostenol 125 -250 mg, IM) have been used to enhance semen collection of donkeys failing to attainan erection in clinical practice. 2A recent study dem- onstrated that administration of cloprostenol reducesthe interval for semen collection without affectings e m e nq u a l i t yi nd o n k e y s . 48In the authors 'practice, some donkeys receive PGF2 aanalog throughout the breeding season three times/week without any appa-rent detrimental effect, and jacks do not seem tobecome refractory. Jacks can have semen collectedin an arti cial vagina while mounting an estrus mare, jenny, or a dummy mount (Fig. 15). All arti cial va- gina (AV) models (e.g., Missouri, Botucatu, and Hanover) used for horses can be successfully used to collect semen in donkeys. 2Despite donkeys having apenis signi cantly longer than stallions, a medium- size AV (e.g., regular length 22 inches) can be used tocollect jack semen (Fig. 15). 2The water temperature of the AV is similar to horses and ranges from 49 to55\u00b0C while lling the AV. 2Tolter the semen, prac- titioners may use horse lters or well-folded gauze. Filters can be coupled with the collection bot-tle, or semen ltration can be carried out right after collection. 2The gel fraction is absent in most ejacu- lates, and when it is present, it will be in a muchsmaller proportion than typically seen in stallions. 2 Since some jacks may take a while to attain a sus- tained erection, the AV can be kept in a Styrofoam box or a warm incubator once ready. Currently, pro-tocols used for chemical induction of ejaculation donot work in donkeys. 2One study imipramine (3 mg/kg) followed by xylazine (0.66 mg/k g ,I V )o ras i n g l ed o s eo fb u t o r p h a n o l( 0 . 0 2 m g / k g , IV) and xylazine (0.33 mg/kg, IV), 49which resulted in no ejaculation.

Gel-free semen volume can be assessed by directmeasurement or more accurately by determining the weight of the semen (1 g = 1 mL). Sperm concentra- tion can be evaluated with a hemocytometer, spectro-photometer bor nucleocountercwith horse settings.2 Donkeys are well-known to have larger testes, a short- ened length of and the highest sper- matogenic per parenchyma.51,52Therefore, con- centration and the total number of sperm are greater in donkeys than horses, and younger donkeys produce ejaculates with lower volume and greater concentra-tion than older jacks. 47Young donkeys tend to pro- duce gel-free ejaculates of 30 to 50 mL, and older donkeys tend to produce gel-free ejaculates of 60 to 90 mL.2,47Typically, sperm concentrations for don- keys vary from 250 to 500 million sperm/mL in don-keys collected two to three times/week. 2,4748The typical total number of sperm ejaculates vary from 20to 40 billion in donkeys collected once or twice a week.2,47,48Donkey motility parameters, including velocity and progressive motility, are also higher thanstallions. 53Jacks often have ejaculates with 80% to 90% of total and progressive sperm motility. Morphology is rarely associated with infertility in don- keys, with most donkeys presenting <15% of morpho- logic defects.54Therefore, sperm morphology evaluation is not typically carried out for the breeding unless there is a history of subfertility or poor semenquality in serial semen collections. Semen Cooling and Shipping Cooled-shipped semen in donkeys can be carried out using horse recommendations, with some exceptions.2 Passive cooling semen containers, such as those used for horsesd-fcan keep donkey semen refrigerated at 5 to 8\u00b0C.2,55Noncentrifuged semen should target 25 to 50 million sperm/mL, and it needs to be extendedat least one part of semen to three parts of extender. 2Milk-based extender alone results in poor motility and conception rates.55If a milk-based ex- tender is used to ship donkey semen, the seminalplasma should be removed via centrifugation or semen ltergor the milk-based extender should be enriched with a source of cholesterol such as egg yolkto maintain motility and fertility. 2Alternatively, milk-based extenders containing cholesterol loaded in cyclodextrinh,iresult in better semen cooling and fer- tility than milk-based available semen-freezing egg-yolk-based extendersjcan be used to cool donkey semen up to 24 hours at 5\u00b0C with excel-lent semen parameters and fertility in horse mares.32,34,36However, up to now, the fertility of cooled donkey semen extended in egg-yolk basedextenders jhas not been tested in jennies. Satisfactory pregnancy rates (73%) can be obtained when jennies are bred with at least 1 billion progressively motile fresh sperm.31In the authors' practice, mares and jennies are bred with at least 2 billion progressivelymotile sperm, the uterus is flushed 6 hoursTable 4.

Cooling and stabilizing semencan be carried out in a freezing control machine ora domestic refrigerator for 20 to 60 minutes, depending on the type of extender. 2Thereafter, the semen can be kept in the freezing machine or transferred 3 to 6 cm over liquid nitrogen vaporfor 15 to 20 minutes and then plunged into liquidnitrogen. 2S e m e nf r o z e ni n0 . 5 - m Ls t r a w sa r e typically thawed at 37 to 38\u00b0C for 30 to 60seconds.2,32The straws can be used for AI via deep-horn insemination with a flexible pipette coupled with a stylet32or a couple with an inner catheter.2If the practitioner is not familiar with deep-horn AI, semen can be thawed and depositedin the uterine body using a standard AIpipette. 2Pregnancy rates with frozen semen vary drastically with the protocol used andbetween species (mares vs. jennies). Mares bredwith donkey frozen-thawed semen present preg-nancy rates around 50% to 70% in commercialbreeding programs, while jennies have muchlower pregnancy rates, averaging 20% to 30% per cycle. 2,32,33,36Results are jack dependent, with some males demonstrating satisfactory pregnancy rates, while others obtain extremely poor preg-nancy rates despite apparently satisfactory spermmotility. 31,33,34 Donkey Epididymal Transport and Epididymal Sperm Recovery and Processing Upon unexpected death, castration, or euthanasia, donkey epididymal sperm can be harvested and cryo- preserved using similar techniques described forstallions. 58The testes and should be removed should beligated to prevent semen wastage. 59For Fig. 14. Washing (A) and drying off (B) the penis of a Mammoth jack. Fig. 15.

Then, the epididymides are dissected from the testes. 58,59Dissection should be performed well enough to be able to stretch the epididymis and allow for a good sperm recovery.58,59Following dissection, semen is harvested by retrograde flushing or flotation/ float-up technique.58,59For retrograde flushing, the tail the epididymis with a straight-bladed Mayo scissor, and the deferens is catheterized with an intravenous catheter, a Tomcat, or less ideally with a needle.58,59The epidi- d y m i si st h e n flushed with semen extender until the complete distension of the tail of the epididymis, andthen it is cut at its most distal portion with a straight-bladed Mayo scissor, and the fluid containing the semen is allowed to out flow into a 50-mL conical tube. 58,59The epididymis can be flushed with milk- based cooling extendersh,m,n,owith volumes from 5 to 30 mL58,59or can be flushed with a semen-freezing extenderj,kwith volumes from 2 to 10 mL.58,59In the authors 'clinical practice, the preferred technique is directly flushing the epididymides with freezing extender.58,59Then, concentration is adjusted to 200 million sperm/mL, and semen is cryopreserved asdescribed above. If poor recovery is obtained with theretrograde flushing, or if the ductus deferens or epidi- dymis are inadvertently perforated, the float-up tech- nique can be used. Sperm yield is approximately 40% to 60% less with the float-up technique than ret- rograde flushing. Up to now, the fertility of donkey epi- didymal frozen-thawed sperm has not been tested in mares or jennies. 4. Conclusion In conclusion, reproductive features and protocols available to manage donkeys in breeding programs have been described. It is worth noting that de- spite the similarities between donkeys and horses, some reproductive features differ remarkably.Therefore, not all horse guidelines are useful forthe donkey species. Knowledge of the reproduc-tive features of the donkey is useful to implement strategies to improve the reproductive ef ciency of this species.

Introduction The estimated global equine population totals 117 million animals, including 58 million horses, 50 mil-lion donkeys, and 9 million mules.1Donkeys are mainly reared for milk production in several countriessuch as Italy2because, thanks to its special proper- ties, donkey milk is suitable for infants who cannot bebreastfed and for people suffering from cow 's milk pro- tein allergies.3-5Currently, donkeys are also used as pets for recreational purposes and pet therapy ratherthan draught or burden animals, according to differ-ent countries. On the contrary, mule populationhas decreased in Europe and the MediterraneanEuropean countries in recent years, while in develop-ing countries, these animals are still widely usedas beasts of burden or working equids for draftpurposes. 1,6 The diagnostic approach and treatment of some dis- eases including tick-borne disease, gastric ulcer syn-drome, intestinal parasite infections, and oculardisease in donkeys and mules are herein discussed onthe basis of current knowledge, updated publications,and personal experience. This paper focuses onthose diseases capable of disrupting the normal physi-ology of donkeys and mules even in the absence of, orwith minimal, clinical signs. Because of their stoi-cism, donkeys and mules tend to show only mild clini-cal symptoms, exhibiting signs of discomfort and paindifferently from horses. Behavioral, anatomical, andphysiological differences among horses, donkeys, andmules have a strong impact on clinical managementand must therefore be known and understood whenapproaching these equids. 2. Tick-Borne Diseases in Donkeys Among the infections transmitted ticks that mayaffect donkeys, Theileria ea l s or e p o r t e dt ob ep o s s i b l es o u r c e so f infection. 7,8In horses, tick-borne diseases are com- monly described, while only one paper is available on NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 175IN-DEPTH: ADVANCES IN DONKEY AND MULE MEDICINEclinical signs in donkeys, this reporting important differences.7In 2014, an epidemiological survey assessed the seroprevalence of tick-borne pathogensaffecting donkeys in Italy.8At o t a lo f1 2 2a d u l td o n - keys were tested for antibodies against T. equi ,B. cab- alli,A. phagocytophilum ,a n d by indirect immuno fluorescent antibody test (IFAT), while the presence of pathogens was veri ed by using specic PCR protocols. According to IFAT results, 48/122 (39.3%) animals were positive for T. equi, 58/ 122 animals (47.5%) were positive for B. caballi, and 9/122 (7.4%) animals were positive for A. phagocytophilum ,w h e r e a sn os p e c i c antibodies for B. burgdorferi s.l. were found in studied donkeys. Considering orB. burgdor- ferion PCR assays. On the basis of the survey by Veronesi and colleagues,8a high exposure of Italian donkeys to piroplasm protozoans was found, thus con- rming the results obtained in previous studies per- formed in donkey populations from other countries, including Turkey, Spain, and China, that showed aseroprevalence ranging from 17% to 93% for B. caballi and from 10% to 47% for T. equi.9-11According to the study by Sgorbini and colleagues,12the risk factors associated with piroplasmosis included advanced ageand outdoor housing. These results agree with previ-ous studies conducted on horses and are consistentw i t hah i g he x p o s u r et ot i c kb i t e s . 12Another study by Piantedosi and colleagues7obtained similar results in donkeys tested for piroplasmosis infection by IFAT andfound no evidence of symptomatic donkeys, as alsoobserved by Veronesi and colleagues. 8Equine piro- plasmosis is endemic in tropical and temperate areasand can occur as acute, subacute, chronic, and subclini-cal presentations, with subclinical being the most fre-quently observed. Animals surviving the acute phase may remain seropositive carriers with low levels of par- asitemia, especially following T. equi infections, 13 which is often responsible for overt clinical forms ofpiroplasmosis. On the contrary, B. caballi infections usually remain latent, although some animals can ex-hibit anemia, inappetence, pyrexia, edema, hemoglo-binuria, reduced work ef ciency, weight loss, and a b o r t i o ni nm a r e s . 13-15Piroplasmosis in donkeys is an underestimated disease because of a natural resist-ance of these equids to infection and a prevalence ofchronic asymptomatic forms typical of animals livingin endemic areas. However, whenever observed, theclinical signs include anorexia, lethargy, disordersof intestinal motility (especially 16A spp. and Theileria spp.D N A i n a d o n k e y population in Central Italy. Clinical examination ndings, hematological analyses, and serum bilirubin evaluations were compared to positive or negative immunologic status. A seroprevalence of 40.6%and 47.8% was found for T. equi and B. caballi ,respectively. PCR results showed that 17.4% of the animals were found to be positive for T. equi and 3.6% for B. caballi by PCR analysis. Clinical examinations revealed 8.7% of the donkey popula- tion had only slight clinical signs consistent with chronic forms of the disease. Animals showed vari- ous degrees of anorexia, depression, pale mucusmembranes, and poor body condition scores. The only symptom related to piroplasmosis was slight icterus, detected in 6 donkeys (Table 1). In con- trast to a previous study performed on horses in Italy, 14no acute form of the disease was found. Despite the lack of speci c clinical presen- tation, 58/138 donkeys had hematological and se- rum bilirubin alterations, and 96.6% of them were IFAT and/or PCR positive. Changes in erythro-cyte number, packed cell volume, hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, telet number, and total infec- tions in donkeys that potentially interfere withanimal welfare and health other than productive and working abilities. 17The unique acute form of piroplasmosis in donkeys has been reported inan adult jack in Italy.7This important difference between horses and donkeys should be taken intoaccount when evaluating donkeys living in endemic areas. Current therapies, mainly basedon the administration of imidocarb dihydrochlor- ide, are derived from equine medicine and are not optimized for donkeys. Drug biodistribution appears to be different between donkeys and horses depending on the differences in plasma vol- umes that could result in increased kidney and liver toxicity in donkeys. 16Moreover, the severe side effects associated with the anticholinergiceffect of the carbanilide derivates, like intense abdom-inal pain, diarrhea, and dyspnea, are much more marked in donkeys than in horses. Prophylaxis is based on the use of topical antiparasitic agents that are not speci cally registered for donkey species. Medications registered for horses, bovines,and sometimes companion animals (i.e., dogs) like synthetic pyrethroids are sometimes used as theyhave wide safety/handling margins, high repelling power, and high residuals lasting about 2 weeks for the pour-on formulations. Among pyrethroids, per- methrin is the most popular; however, sprays based on deltamethrin, cy flu- thrin, alphacypermethrin, and flumethrin are com- mercially available as well. 3. Intestinal Cyathostomin Infections in Donkeys and Mules Worldwide, gastrointestinal parasite infestations rep- resent a major challenge for equids including mules and donkeys. Clinical signs typically include diar- rhea, ventral abdominal edema, pyrexia, colic,IN-DEPTH: ADVANCES IN DONKEY AND MULE MEDICINE 176 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSweight loss, and poor body condition.18Equids are usually coinfected with different nematode species. Cyathostomins (small strongyles) areconsidered as the most important intestinal parasitegroup in wild and domestic equids for their pathogenicpotential at both larval and adult stages to negativelyimpact wellness. 19,20Therefore, these nematodes, characterized by a widespread distribution, are ofmajor concern, and ef cient control based on the appropriate management, diagnosis, and use of ant-helmintic products is mandatory. 21,22 In past years, control of gastrointestinal para- sites was based on regular and frequent adminis-tration of anthelmintic drugs as preventivetreatment strategy. However, in light of theincreasing evidence of anthelmintic resistanceand changes in parasite distribution, a re-exami-nation of recommendations for parasite controlhas been necessary. In response to this need,the American Association of Equine Practitioners(AAEP) has formed a task force charged with pro-ducing a comprehensive set of recommendationsfor helping veterinarians to improve strategiesand programs for parasite control in horses. Themost signi cant change has been the development of a new way of thinking with the goal of limiting para-site infections rather than eradicating all parasitesfrom the equine gastrointestinal tract (GIT). 23 Therefore, equine clinicians should adopt suitablestrategies in order to maintain limited parasiteTable 1. IFAT/PCR and Serum Bilirubin in Symptomatic Donkeys hemoglobin concentration; total bilirubin.IN-DEPTH: ADVANCES IN DONKEY AND MULE MEDICINE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 177infection and egg shedding and guarantee animal welfare by minimizing the risk of parasitic disease. By doing this, there is a higher chance of maintaining ef cacious drugs avoiding further devel- opment of anthelmintic resistance. To achievethese goals, it is fundamental to know the magnitudeof egg shedding of individual horses by performing periodic fecal egg count surveillance. 23The modi- ed McMaster fecal egg count procedure is the most extensively used technique; however, the techniquea is a new technique that has been developed by the University of Naples (Italy) and validated in several scienti c papers as easy to use in clinical practice. The current guidelines established by the World Association for Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology24and the AAEP suggest the assessment of the fecal egg count reduction (FERC) to know thepercentage of ef cacy of an anthelmintic substance. FERC can be calculated according to the formula FERC (%) = 100[(C /C0T)/C], where C is the geometric mean of eggs per gram (EPG) beforethe treatment and T is the geometric mean of EPG after the treatment. The geometric mean was cal- culated by averaging the log counts (x + 1) of the sin-gle EPG values, taking the antilogarithm, and then subtracting 1. At the present time, none of the three anthelmintic drug classes registered forhorses (benzimidazoles, pyrimidines, and macrocyclic lactones) are currently available for treatment of par- asites in mules, and only a few drugs are speci cally licensed for use in donkeys. 25-28Therefore, mules and donkeys are usually treated with anthelminticdrugs at the same dosage, route, and intervals li- censed for horses, despite the lack of scienti cr e p o r t s evaluating pharmacokinetics and ef cacy related to their use in these animals. 2,25,29 Among anthelmintic compounds registered for equine species, ivermectin is a macrocyclic lactone commonly used due to its broad spectrum of activity against both endo- and ectoparasites.25,30Ar e c e n t study by Bazzano and colleagues31investigated both pharmacokinetics and ef cacy of ivermectin orally administered in mules at 200 lg/kg body weight (BW). Mules were found to have intermediatepharmacokinetic parameters between horses and don-keys, and these compounds seemed to be ef cacious against cyatho-stomins (Table 2). Among anthelmin- tic drugs, macrocyclic lactones are characterized by a very long egg reappearance period, but recent reports have documented them shortened to just 4 to 5 weeks for both ivermectin and moxidectin on farms with high treatment frequencies.23This is interpreted as emerging resistance in cyathostomins to this drugclass. Thus, for macrocyclic lactones, it can be of value to run one set of posttreatment egg counts at around 4- 6 weeks posttreatment to gauge the egg reappearance period status on the selected farm. 23 The recurring onset of anthelmintic resistance to- gether with the restrictions in the use of drugs in food-producing animals have enforced the search forsustainable alternative approaches for parasite control. 32Among the nutritional supplements used for the control of internal parasites in equine hus-bandry, promising results have been gained with the employment of plant-derived compounds.33,34 Although many plants have been listed as havinganthelmintic activity in animalsc,35and the use of plant-derived anthelmintics would be preferable tosynthetic drugs in dairy farming, scienti cd a t ad e m - onstrating the real ef cacy of these compounds against gastrointestinal parasites are scarce. In a recent study by Arfuso and colleagues, 36dairy don- keys were treated with the commercially availablephytotherapeutic product.bAccording to the manufac- turer 's instructions, the product was administered two times at 2-week intervals (i.e., day 1, day 14)using the dose of one syringe (50 g) per donkey. Two administrations of phytotherapeutic supplement at fortnight interval were successful in reducing 56.9% intestinal strongyle egg shedding in naturally infected donkeys, causing no adverse reaction in treated ani- mals throughout the experimental period. The FERC value obtained following phytotherapeutic sup- plementation was lower compared with other anthel- mintic tested in donkeys, such as ivermectin (96%)37and eprinomectin (99%).38The value was also lower when compared to the suggested cutoff valuesfor interpreting results of strongyle FERC in horsesTable 2.

Equine Gastric Ulcer Syndrome in Donkeys The de nition of equine gastric ulcer syndrome (EGUS) embraces different conditions characterizedby ulcers four localizations: terminal portionof the esophagus, proximal (squamous) and the stomach, and proximal part ofthe duodenum. This syndrome has been rarelydescribed in donkeys, and reports are limited to post-mortem studies on animals submitted for ne-cropsy. In a previous study by Sgorbini and col-leagues, the prevalence, anatomical distribution, andeffect of age and sex of EGUS were investigated inlive adult donkeys. 12In that report, 39 donkeys underwent gastroscopic examination, and gastric lesions were present in 20/39 (51.3%) donkeys. In particular, 19/39 (48.7%) were affected disease both ESGD and glandular gastricdisease. Thus, 95% of donkeys affected by EGUSshowed lesions located in the nonglandular mu-cosa. In donkeysaffected by EGUS, ESGD was primarily lesions located around the cardia and along thelesser curvature. The equine glandular gastric dis- ease lesion the ventral glan- dular fundus. Despite endoscopic ndings, no animal showed clinical signs of EGUS, and no signi - cant correlation with sex, age, or breed was found. 5. Ophthalmology in Donkeys and Mules Donkeys and mules can suffer from similar ocular dis- eases to horses but with a different prevalence. The incidence of ocular disease in a 3-year period in don- keys was 9% at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of Camerino University (Italy; personal author data),much lower than that reported infective com-mon conditions reported. Ocular traumatic injuriesare less frequent than in horses, likely because oftheir quieter attitude. Because of their stoicism,donkeys and mules do not show early clinical signs ofocular disease. 42Clinical examination of the eye can be more dif cult in these equids than in horses. In f a c t ,t h el a t e r a la s p e c to ft h ef r o n t a lb o n e( t h es u p r a - orbital ridge, forming the dorsal part of the orbit) is more laterally pronounced in donkeys and mules thanin horses (Fig. 1), and consequently, the direct evalua-tion of the eye is uncomfortable since the procedure tolift the upper eyelid is more dif cult and sometimes impossible to perform, especially in the donkey. This is also due to the stronger palpebral muscles. 42As a result, during the ultrasound examination of the eye,it is sometimes not possible to visualize the retro-bulbar region due to the obstacle caused by this por-tion of the frontal bone when approaching thesupraorbital acoustic window. It follows that carefulclinical inspection of the eye in donkeys and mules of- ten requires sedation, nerve blocks, and local anesthe- sia, which are not necessarily required in horses insimilar conditions. Prolonged ocular topical treat-ment is also challenging in donkeys and mules. Thedifculty opening the eye, their small size, and less ex- perience with being handled makes prolonged oculartopical treatment challenging in donkey andmules. For this reason, the application of a subpal-pebral lavage system (SPL) in donkeys and mules is more often indicated than in horses. Furthermore, since sedation, nerve blocks (to overcome the strongpalpebral muscles), and topical anesthesia are usuallynecessary for examination, SPL can be directlyapplied after diagnosis, if indicated. The technique forapplication of SPL in donkeys and mules is the sameas in horses: the zygomatic process is slightly largerin donkeys and mules, and this should be taken intoaccount when this part of the bone is palpated while looking for the supraorbital foramen for anesthetic injection. 6. Conclusions In the present paper, the main features of piroplasmo- sis, equine gastric ulcer syndrome and ocular diseases in donkeys, have been highlighted. Epidemiologyand clinical presentation of piroplasmosis and other tick-borne diseases show some differences between horses and donkeys, the latter havingless severe symptoms despite high exposure to theparasites. Nonspeci c clinical presentation or Fig. 1. Difference in the supraorbital ridge between horse and donkey.IN-DEPTH: ADVANCES IN DONKEY AND MULE MEDICINE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 179asymptomatic forms of B. caballi and T. equi infections seem to be common in donkeys, and sev- eral clinical pathology alterations persist afternatural infection. Therefore, even if clinicallyhealthy, donkeys can be subjected to severe clini-cal pathological alterations. Acute presentations are very seldom observed in donkeys. Clinical monitoring of those donkeys that are chronicallyinfected should be recommended because theyrepresent a risk for transmission to other animals(as inapparent carriers) and their health status and productive performances could be altered. Decades of frequent anthelmintic use have selected for highlevels of anthelmintic drug resistance in several par-asite families like cyathostomins and Parascaris spp. populations, 19which emphasizes that the tra- ditional approaches for parasite control are notsustainable anymore and that new strategies areneeded. 19Preventive treatment should never be used, and a speci c etiological diagnosis should be conducted before every treatment. Togetherwith the recurring onset of anthelmintic resist-ance in equids, the increased public awareness ofdrug residues in animal products compels the sci-entic community to investigate novel strategies to control parasitic diseases in domestic animals. Theresults of investigations highlight a high prevalence ofEGUS in a population of nonworking donkeys with noclinical signs of this disease. Furthermore, the squa-mous portion of the stomach was found to be much more frequently affected than the glandular region, as already reported for horses. This suggests thatEGUS may be common in donkeys, but it is routinelyoverlooked. This suggests that subclinical forms ofthis syndrome could be present in apparently healthy donkeys. Thus, the effect of subclinical EGUS in donkeys needs to be thoroughly investigated int h ef u t u r et oe x h a u s t i v e l yv e r i f yt h ei m p a c to nwork or production performances. Several pecu-liarities of donkeys are present when compared to horses. Disease presentation can be very differ- ent, and the epidemiology of infectious and nonin-fectious diseases also needs to be speci cally studied for donkeys to identify control plans todecrease the incidence and consequences of sub- clinical diseases.

Introduction Donkeys, mules, and hinnies are likely the most mis- understood equines in terms of their behavior. Theyhave served humans for thousands of years, and yetthere is still very little known about them from a sci- entico rc l i n i c a lp o i n to fv i e w . 1,2The increasing popularity of donkeys as companion animals and mules as performance and recreational animals has led to an increase in cases being presented at clinics. Oftentimes when donkeys and mules arenally brought to the clinic, they are in advanced stages of a disease due to their stoic nature masking any signs of discomfort or pain.1,2The natural behavior of donkeys and mules is more a freeze or ght behavior than flight, which has been reported to partially (around 20%) depend on a genetic donkey-specicb a s i s .3When compared to horses, studies have shown that mules especially have a keen sense of reasoning and donkeys have a high IQ.4,5Keeping this in mind, the donkey, in particular, will continue toght through the pain and discomfort by continuing to eat, drink, and appear, from a behavioral stand- point, that nothing is abnormal. Mules and hinnies (the reciprocal cross, where the sire is a stallion andthe dam is a jenny, female donkey) may show clinical signs earlier than donkeys, but the disease may wellbe more advanced than they show. The other chal-lenge to working with both mules and donkeys, from abehavioral standpoint, is getting to know the animalbefore performing routine procedures, such as takingtemperature or performing a physical exam. Mulesand donkeys tend to have a greater range of motionfor kicking; hence, a practitioner needs to proceed with more caution than when working on a horse. A practitioner 's approach to getting to know a mule or donkey is essential to proceed. Time spent on thisstage will enhance the scenario for both the patientand the practitioner. This paper will focus on severaltips a clinician can implement when approaching amule or donkey for the rst time, how to safely and effectively restrain a donkey or mule for further exam-ination or procedures, and how to notice subtle differ-ences in behavior related to disease or pain. Approach and Handling When approaching mules and hinnies, research hasfound with over 900 mules, hinnies, and donkeys inmany countries, including Egypt, Mexico, Peru, NOTES 182 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: ADVANCES IN DONKEY AND MULE MEDICINESpain, and the United States, one should rst approach the head of the animal.2,6Research has revealed that oftentimes it is easier for a familiar per- son (e.g., owner or handler) to interact with mules and donkeys compared to an unfamiliar person (Fig. 1).1,2,6 Practitioners should bear this in mind when they approach mules and hinnies, in particular, or whenadministering medication or drawing blood, amongother actions, as the success in the application of acertain, even routine, action or procedure maystrongly depend on the trust of the animal toward the operator or on the strength of the bond between a Fig. 1. Approach tests have shown that mules and hinnies are more willing to allow a familiar person to approach their forehead (green) and left side of their neck (blue) and touch their ears (yellow) than an unfamiliar person.

Note the following body language indicators of wariness: the flared nos- tril, position of the head, neck carriage, body posture, and gen- eral readiness to flee. Fig. 5. Dr. Farid Shwky has been able to gain the trust of this mule by rst extending his hand; now the mule has allowed him to touch its forehead. Notice the relaxed ear position, head andneck posture. Fig. 6. An example of a handler using voice and touch whilethe practitioner takes the hinny 's temperature in Antiqua, Colombia. Dr. Miguel Nova is familiar with these mules, butnotice the mule is also tied during this procedure. Fig. 7. This hinny has its head and neck leaning away as the practitioner approaches and has worked her hand backward. She is continuing to be calm and providing tactile support to quiet the animal (Equitarian Initiative Peru Project, 2016).8IN-DEPTH: ADVANCES IN DONKEY AND MULE MEDICINE 184 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSReading Body Language Approach the equine slowly, extending a hand for a gentle pet or rub on the forehead and move slowly andwith patience.1,2,8,9The long-eared equid will allow you to proceed if it drops its head and neck or extendsits nose forward (Fig. 3). Even if donkeys tend to be less timid or resistant when meeting unfamiliarpeople than mules and hinnies, caution must be paid when approaching donkeys or horse-donkey hybrids. If the donkey, mule, or hinny remains alarmed, a difference will be noticed in body posture and stance, along with ears facing forward, enlarged nostrils, and a swishing tail, especially with mules and hinnies (Fig. 4). As aforementioned, this may make attempting routine veterinary or husbandryprocedures more challenging when treatment is being provided by an unfamiliar person. 1,2,8,9Furthermore, the speci c knowledge of operators on the particular stoic nature and of the pertinent cautions that approaching donkeys and their hybrid congenersrequire have been reported to condition the misinter- pretation of body signs.1A nervous or scared donkey may turn their ears to the side and clamp theirtails. Previous studies have found that donkeys, mules, and hinnies tend to respond well to voice and touch. 1,10A soothing tone of voice appears to provide some comfort to the animal, likely allowing the practi- tioner to proceed (Fig. 5). Once the practitioner has made it past the equid' s forehead, the next step is to slowly work up its neck; if planning to use a Fig. 8. A, When frightened, mules may pin their ears and/or show tightening around the eye/nostrils. B, Other signs include turn- ing their bodies away. Do not proceed in this case; have the handler try to calm the mule and then extend your hand. Fig. 9. Mules in both gures A and B are accepting of an unfamiliar person and are allowing chin contact.

When taking their temperature, make sure andstand to the animal 's side or simply place them in stocks if they are available. In some cases, thep r a c t i t i o n e rm a yh a v et oa p p l yar e s t r a i n tt om o d i f y the equid 's behavior for both the practitioner 'sa n d the animal' s safety. Many mules, hinnies, and don- keys are quite resistant to rectal thermometers; injec- tions can also present challenges (Fig. 6). Based onhow adept they are at using their neck for leverage,particularly when trying to evade an uncomfortableprocedure, mules, hinnies, and donkeys seem to havea knack for pulling away from handlers. Mules and donkeys are less likely than horses to panic when tied. Consequently, practitioners may need torestrain the patient in this way if a stock is not avail-able to apply more restraints. In these regards,restraints (e.g., a twitch) used in a proactive mannercan be quite useful. The strength of mules and don-keys in their head and neck is unlike any horse manyhave dealt with, and they will slowly and easily move where they turn their heads or necks to evade any uncomfortable procedures. 1When lifting a leg, the action of mules and donkeys to lean into the operatorinstead of away from him/her is not an uncommonreaction. As a result, it may be necessary to ask thehandler to lift the patient 's leg when performing a lameness exam and/or hold up a leg when examining another leg. Among all the body parts that can be in- formative about the behavioral status of a certain ani-mal, donkeys and mules will tell a lot about theirbehavior by their ear posture, nostril flare, head and neck position, and tail movement (Figs. 7, 8A and B,9A and B). 1,2,8,11 Other methods to proactively work with mules and d o n k e y si sb yo f f e r i n gaf o o dr e w a r di fa l l o w e db yt h eowner or handler.3In some cases, a mule or donkey may prove to be calmer and less resistant when in thepresence of a familiar equid. If mules or donkeys arekept in the hospital, it is not uncommon for mules tobe restless in stalls and express vocalization.

This will gener-ally decrease their restless behavior, which can sometimes be counterproductive depending on the procedure or surgery that has been Fig. 10. Twitches, when used judiciously, have shown to calm mules and hinnies that do not tolerate routine procedures (twitches at Idaho Equine, Nampa, ID). The twitch may actually decrease the stress on the mule or hinny when it isresisting a procedure. 1,2,12 Fig. 11.

Donkeys that stay in the hospital tend to do best if they can have a donkey mate or, again, a fa-miliar animal with them. Digestive Behavior Both donkeys and mules may not drink well in the clinic and additional sweeteners may need to be added to the water to prevent dehydration and other compli- cations like colic. The speci c habits of the owner in regard to feeding and water provision must be also considered as particularly donkeys may display unex-pected avoidance to patterns or practices to whichthey may not be accustomed. 10 Reproductive Behavior When working with breeding jacks in the clinic, recog- nize that they may be very shy breeders, will need a quiet area to be collected, and again, will need toget to know the handlers and gain trust beforebeing collected. Many jacks are very slow to becollected compared to horses, and the slightestchange in their environment can decrease repro-ductive behavior. Also, be aware that jacks can bevery strong when being handled so consider a studchain across the nose. In some cases, they mayshow excessive signs of aggression toward mares orjennies and a muzzle may be needed. 7 Restraint To perform a clinical exam, the mule or donkey must remain calm and still. This can be a chal- lenge considering the abovementioned methods ofintroducing oneself to a mule. To reduce theamount of stress on the animal, handler, and practi-tioner, it is best to begin with the animal beingcalm. If a routine health task cannot be safely per-formed, nose twitches can be an effective form ofrestraint, especially a twitch with a long handle to hold and string twitch (Fig. 10). Blindfolds used to cover the mule 's and hinny 's eyes have also proven to be effective methods of calming an animal toreceive treatment ranging from deworming to vacci-nating to farrier work (Fig. 11). Another form ofrestraint that may work, but must be done by some-one trained in the safe application of the procedure,is the lifting of an opposite leg and tying the leg upwith a safety knot to a loop made around the neck ofthe mule that does not slip. Last but not least,chemical restraint has been reported to workwell when aiming to administer an injection. 8,12 Pharmacological restraint can decrease the levelof fear and resistance for routine procedures.Sedation with a2-adrenoreceptor agonists (xylazine and detomidine) alone or in combination withopioids (e.g., butorphanol) can be used as ancillarychemical restraint methods. 2When using xylazine in mules, studies have shown a shorter half-life,and a typical horse dose of 0.6 mg/kg intravenously(IV) should be increased 50% for mules, but this isnot required for donkeys. 12,13Detomidine oral gel may also be useful for mules and donkeys ifobtaining intramuscular or intravenous access is difcult.12,14One should allow for at least 40 minutes of sedation for donkeys when using the typ-ical horse dose. 12Currently, no reports have been given for doses and level of sedation when using detomidine oral gel in mules.13Often, analgesic agents may be metabolized at a higher rate and need to be readministered to produce the same effect in mules (refer to Table 1 for doses).11,12,13,15 Pay close attention to the level of reaction and alert- ness when the mule is sedated to determine if more sedatives should be administered (Figs. 12, A and B). Subtle Signs of Pain Both donkeys and mules generally show subtle signs of pain.1,2,12Lameness may be evidenced when don- keys, mules, or hinnies shift weight on all four limbs and occasionally rest or take weight off one hind limb. Still, the signs can generally go unnoticed. Contextually, owners and handlers who are very fa-miliar with their donkeys and mules may be theirbest advocates and will often pick up on signs more quickly than anyone else Example signs might be a slight decrease in appetite, shifting weight, slighttwitch of the tail, standing in different places than usual, increased tension in the orbital area/nostrils, and ear positioning down or back, along with changesin their eyes from bright and alert to glossy or glazed. Any or all may suggest that the donkey or mule is showing signs of discomfort. Attempts todene facial and body assessments related to pain in donkeys were recently published by the authors(Figs. 13-16). 11Current ongoing research by the authors is investigating the use of sensor technology (SmartHalter) to assist in detecting pain or discomfort in mules and donkeys to better assist with detectingslight changes in physiological signs such as heart rate and respiration paired with behavioral signs such as recumbency or rolling. Fig. 12. When mules are sedated, pay attention to their head and neck posture (A), ears will likely go to the side and face downward. From the lateral view (B), some orbital tightening and a relaxed nostril can be seen.IN-DEPTH: ADVANCES IN DONKEY AND MULE MEDICINE 188 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGS2. Summary A key to donkey and mule behavior is being patient and working to gain their trust. To safely work with mules and donkeys, reading their body language and preventing them from evading the procedure are nec- essary to perform a clinical exam. It may be neces-sary to have the owner or handler stand by to assistwith holding or comforting the animal prior to begin-ning the procedure. Physical restraints, such asnose twitches are very effective in mules and some-what in donkeys. Chemical restraint is likely thesafest form of restraint, but make sure to use the proper dosage for a donkey or mule (Table 1). 12,14,15 Both will metabolize medications more quickly than horses of the same size. When attempting todene pain or signs of discomfort in mules anddonkeys, start by examining the face and take in the overall body stance and posture. Keep inmind both donkeys and mules will likely mask pain and signs of pain due to their ght or freeze nature, but one can still notice signs by observing facial action units, body posture, and tail movement. 1,7If a mule or donkey appears healthy but the owner is describing a difference in their behavior, the ani- mal is likely sick or in pain, so consider their infor-mation and remember both donkeys and mules aregenerally in a more advanced stage of distress but will likely show fewer signs. Suggest to owners who are raising mules to handle their foals fromday one so that routine procedures such as takinga temperature, using a stethoscope, picking up hooves, or administering an injection are not com- plicated and stressful. 1,7,8In the long run, mules Fig. 13.

Introduction Given that the cardiovascular system is central to the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the peripheral tis-sues, any cardiac abnormality that affects cardiac out-put could result in decreased athletic capacity, whichis seen clinically as poor performance. 1,2The equine cardiovascular system, however, is one of tremendousreserve capacity; therefore, it can take quite consider-able dysfunction to result in a measurable effect onperformance. In addition, it should be consideredthat there are cardiac conditions that do not affectoverall performance per se but could result in a sud- den and dramatic adverse event during exercise (e.g., weakness, collapse, or sudden cardiac death). 3One of the dif culties practitioners face is trying to deter- mine the cause of a horse' s reduced perfor- mance. There can be a variety of abnormalitiesdetected on physical examination, but deciding ifa single problem alone or, much more commonly,if a combination of problems are acting together toreduce the exercise capacity of an individual ani-mal can be challenging. The breed of horse andthe type of exercise (e.g., high-speed racehorse,endurance, or short duration high-intensity stockhandling) will also in fluence how the clinical signs of poor performance are manifested. In addition,it is important to note if the performance of thehorse has suddenly changed in recent times, ifthis problem is longer standing, or if, in fact, thehorse has always performed below the owner/trainer 's expectations. Cardiac murmurs are common ndings on physical examination of horses. 4-6Trying to decide if the murmur is clini- cally relevant requires experience, interpretation of other clinical ndings, the addition of further diagnostic investigations, including echocardiog- raphy, resting and exercising electrocardiogr-aphy (ECG) analysis, and in some casesstress testing under exercising conditions. Anyreported change in murmur intensity or develop-ment of a new murmur should be evaluated partic-ularly closely. 2. Recognizing and Describing Murmurs on Clinical Examination Therst step when evaluating a horse with poor per- formance is to perform a thorough clinical examina- tion, including careful auscultation of the heart fromboth sides of the thorax and assessment of the entirecardiovascular system. 7The normal heart sounds should be identi e d ,a ss e e ni nF i g .1 . S1 (closing of the atrio-ventricular valves) and S2 (closing of the semi-lunar valves) should be appreci-ated in all healthy horses. S4 is appreciated in manybut not all horses and can become more prominent inolder horses (as a result of a more active atrial contri-bution to ventricular lling in late diastole). S3 is usually quite subtle and dull and more commonly NOTES 192 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: MEDICAL REASONS FOR POOR PERFORMANCEheard in younger horses (due to a more active early ventricular lling phase); it can become very promi- nent in the rare cases of heart failure. Murmurs aresounds that occur between the normal heart sounds, either caused by the physiological flow of blood or from turbulence created by pathological ab-normalities. Murmurs should be described using the criteria in Table 1. Some cardiac murmurs remain similar over a long period, whereas others can change in intensity and character over time (some mur- murs increase in grade, whereas others become Table 1. Criteria for Describing and Reporting on Cardiac Murmurs Criterion Comments Timing Within the cardiac cycle \u0081Systolic, diastolic, or continuous \u0081early, mid, or late \u0081Holosystolic/holodiastolic (whole duration of systole/diastole but S1/S2 still audible \u0081Pansystolic/pandiastolic (whole duration of systole/diastole, S1/S2 or both no longer audible \u0081Diastolic murmurs tend to vary in duration depending on heart rate (longer at lower heart rates, shorter at higher heart rates), and systolic murmurs are similarduration regardless of heart rate Point of maximal intensity (PMI)Where is the murmur loudest \u0081Left or right \u0081Base (near shoulder (mitral, aortic, Grade Intensity or loudness of the murmur (note that this can but not necessarily relate to the severity of the problem) 1.

The normal heart sounds are visualized and the timingof systole and diastole explained.HOW-TO SESSION: MEDICAL REASONS FOR POOR PERFORMANCE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 193quieter). These changes can re flect alterations in intra-cardiac gradients (pressure equalization as com- pensatory mechanisms fail) or different vibration mechanics (e.g., as seen with aortic regurgitationwhen nodular degeneration on the aortic cuspbecomes stiffer and more brotic vibrating less or a sudden honking vibratory murmur in a horse withlong-standing mitral regurgitation [MR], indicatingchordal rupture). A sudden change in murmurquality is an indication for re-evaluation withechocardiography. It is important to clearly describe thendings of the auscultation in the medical record and when discussing the case with colleagues, to ensure accurate information is recorded. The use ofa high-quality analogue stethoscope is invaluable for clear auscultation, whereas the auscultation condi- tions (e.g., quiet barn, no external noise, and horsestanding still) are extremely important for a thoroughcardiovascular evaluation. The use of a digital am- plier on an analogue stethoscope or the use of a fully digital stethoscope can provide additional information about the timing and duration of the murmur andallow recording of the murmur to be included for teaching purposes and as part of the medical record. 3. Physiological Flow Murmurs In some horses, particularly younger horses with lower body condition or a thin chest wall, the flow of blood in the great vessels can be appreciated. These murmurs are often referred to as \"ejection murmurs, \" corresponding with the ejection of blood into the great vessels in early systole. It is important to recognizethat these physiological murmurs are short in dura- tion (early systolic), quiet (grade 2 or less), and audi- ble only cranially on the left, over the area of the greatvessels (Fig. 2). 7Occasionally, physiological diastoliclling murmurs are detected, particularly in young horses. Some of these murmurs are described as an early-mid Caused by the turbulent flow of blood, these pathologi- cal murmurs are most commonly the result of valvu- lar regurgitation, although occasionally they arecaused by abnormal cham- bers and/or vessels.1,4,7Valvular stenosis is exceed- ingly rare in horses, compared with other species, and is usually only seen in combination with a complexcongenital malformation. Rarely in horses, addi-tional sounds on auscultation superimposing the \"nor- mal \"heart sounds can be caused by pericardial disease; these pericardial friction rubs are caused bymotion of the heart against the pericardium and areoften highly variable in intensity, location, andduration. Valvular regurgitation, causing a backfl ow of blood across the valve, is a common nding, particu- larly in athletic horses. determining the of anyregurgitation and correlating that to the reportedabnormalities of reduced or poor performance. Somevalvular regurgitations are known to increase withathletic training, and it is important to recognizethese \"typical \"regurgitations from those with patho- logical consequences. It is also fundamental to recog-nize that the regurgitation per se is not the biggestissue but rather the cardiac remodeling that occurs inthe \"receiving chamber, \"the cardiac chamber that receives the regurgitant blood. The degree ofcardiac remodeling cannot be easily determined based on physical examination alone; therefore, echocardiography and ECG analysis are impor-tant parts of the diagnostic evaluation. The com-mon murmurs and their consequences aresummarized in Table 2. 5. Echocardiographic Assessment and ECG Analysis Although the clinical examination is critical to alert the practitioner to a problem, it is the additional diagnostic evaluation (echocardiography and ECG analysis) that will provide information about the sev-erity, hemodynamic relevance, and likely rate ofprogression. A standardized approach to echocardiog-raphy and ECG analysis 13,14is recommended, in order to fully assess all the cardiac structures. The speci c indications for echocardiography and ECG analysisare listed in Table 3.15Still images and cineloops should be stored and standardized measurements per-formed, which will allow a comparison of structuresover time, which is particularly important when evalu-ating the rate of disease progression. These data on cardiac chamber size, systolic and diastolic function, valvular and chamber morphology, and the presence ofany concurrent arrhythmias assist in the evaluationof identi ed cardiac abnormalities as a likely cause of Fig. 2.

In the rare cases of subpul- monic VSD location, the murmur can be loudestvery cranial on the left, over the pulmonary valve.Receiving chamber: Although the shunt flow through a VSD is typically L !R, the shunt flow is predominantly systolic; therefore, the blood quickly enters the pulmo-nary circulation, so that RV size and function are not as affected. From the lungs,the blood returns to the left heart, leading to enlarge- ment of the LA and LV over time.There are several things that in flu- ence the clinical relevance of aVSD 10,11 1. Size of the defect (relative to the size of the heart) 2. Location of the defect (paramembranous/muscular/ subpulmonic) 3. Pressure gradient between the LV and RV (and pulmonary circulation) 4. Abnormalities of aortic root align- ment (e.g., dextro-positioned/overriding aorta) 5. Involvement of the aortic cusps and tricuspid valve in the defect 6. Presence of concurrent congenital anomaliesThe clinical signs of a VSD will depend on the degree of cardiac remodeling present. Horses with small, restrictive VSDs can have normal performance and normal life expectancy. Horses with clinically relevant VSDs can have reduced athletic capacityand poor performance, respiratorysigns, and weakness and are predis- posed to arrhythmias that can cause reduced performance or have safety implications.

Summary In most cases, the common causes of cardiac mur-murs, namely, valvular regurgitations, are well toler-ated, and most horses with cardiac disease havecompletely normal exercise tolerance, performance,and life expectancy. In these horses, a thoroughinvestigation of the other organ systems is required todetermine the cause of their poor performance (e.g.,musculoskeletal, respiratory, neurological, andbehavioral). 1,2,16It should be noted that diastolic murmurs compatible with aortic regurgitation (espe-cially in horses with increased pulse pressure or a\"hyperkinetic \"pulse) are generally more worrisome d u et ot h ep o t e n t i a lc o n s e q u e n c e s( l e f tv e n t r i c l e[ L V ]dilation, malignant ventricular arrhythmias, development of a pathological arrhythmialike atrial brillation certainly might be very relevant when it comes to performance limitation and shoulddenitely be considered when monitoring for dis- ease progression. Far less commonly, a rapidlyprogressing, severe valvular regurgitation canbecome hemodynamically relevant, resulting inreduced exercise capacity, poor performance, anddecrease life expectancy. 5,17,18Most (but not all) congenital defects are identi ed earlier in a horse 's life, and depending on the severity of the defect, some horses can perform and have a normallife expectancy, whereas others will develop severeclinical signs and present with exercise intolerance orsigns of congestive heart failure. 10As practitioners, the key is to recognize cardiac abnormalities on athorough clinical examination, investigate those meet-ing the criteria for additional diagnostic evaluation,and then closely monitor the horse for any change inperformance. From a safety perspective, early recog- nition and close monitoring of horses with aortic re- gurgitation are considered particularly important.

For these reasons, the medical term \"equine asthma \"is now being used to foster better communication between all stakeholders.1-3Based on severity, the term \"severe equine asthma \"is now used to describe the condition previously known as heavesor recurrent airway obstruction (RAO; equine COPD, moderate equine asthma \"are used to describe what was known as \"inflammatory airway disease (IAD). \"\"moderate equine asthma \" describes the condition of horses with clinical signs (e.g., cough) or clinical ndings (abnormal lung sounds) of a lung disease but without the presence, or a history, of labored breathing at rest. The term \"mild equine asthma \"is used for horses pre- senting exercise intolerance and a lower airwayinflammation or obstruction but without obvious clinical signs suggestive of lung diseases. Equine asthma may further be de ned based on the triggering factors (barn/hay and pasture) andthe in pathways) are emerging in equine asthma and may eventually lead to personalizedtherapy. 4 2. Main Features Inhalation of the offending antigens, especially thosepresent in hay and bedding during stabling, causesinflammation and obstruction of the airways. This in turn is responsible for the development of the clini- cal signs observed in equine asthma, which include exercise intolerance and, for the more severe syn-drome, cough, increased respiratory rate, and laboredbreathing at rest. While the severity of the clinicalsigns may progress in genetically susceptible horses,the condition may be transient or intermittent insome horses or even persist without further progres-sion in mild and moderate equine asthma. The timebetween exposure and the development of clinicalsigns is variable, as is the severity of airway hyper-reactivity and in flammation. While strong epidemio- logical studies are lacking, it has been proposed thatup to 75-80% of horses will develop milder forms ofequine asthma in their lifetime. 3Recent ndings suggest that in flammation-induced airway structural changes (remodeling) may be responsible for the pro-gression of equine asthma in some horses.5 NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 199HOW-TO SESSION: MEDICAL REASONS FOR POOR PERFORMANCE3. How to Diagnose Moderate Equine Asthma The diagnosis of moderate equine asthma is usually straightforward and is based on the presence of a chronic cough in an otherwise healthy horse. It isconrmed by demonstrating in flammation using bron- choalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cytology. may also bepresent. Bloodwork, thoracic ultrasound, and radio-graphs are normal. Clinical signs include intermit-tent or frequent coughing episodes at rest, when eating,or during exercise. Physical examination may reveala bilateral, intermittent, or persistent serous or seromu-cous nasal discharge. A tachypnea at rest, but withoutnasal flaring or increased abdominal excursions as in severe asthma, may be present. Thoracic auscultationmay reveal localized or generalized crackles andwheezes when using a rebreathing bag. Physical ex-amination is otherwise unremarkable. These ndings indicate the presence of a lower airway condition andshould raise suspicion for equine asthma. BALF cytol-ogy revealing increased percentages of neutrophils,mast cells, or eosinophils is con rmatory for the diagno- sis of moderate equine asthma when combined with thepresence of respiratory signs. In absence of BALF cy-tology, increased amount of tracheal mucus on endos-copy combined with a positive response to therapy issupportive of the diagnosis. 4. How to Diagnose Mild Equine Asthma Mild equine asthma is a diagnostic challenge as decreased exercise tolerance or poor performance with a prolonged recovery period after exercise are the onlypresenting clinical signs in athletic horses. Becauseof the absence of clinical signs suggestive of a lungcondition, it is a largely overlooked cause of exerciseintolerance in high performance horses. The diagno-s i si sb a s e do nt h ep r e s e n c eo fe x e r c i s ei n t o l e r a n c eand lower airway in flammation documented by an abnormal BALF cytology, combined with the exclu-sion of other common causes of exercise intolerance(upper airway obstruction, lameness, myopathy, car-diac pathology, on willlead the clinician to investigate the lungs, but thesendings are inconsistent. The response to therapy (decreased inhaled antigens and noxious gas, cortico-steroids, bronchodilators) will often be required to con-rm the diagnosis. 5. Diagnostic Aids for Equine Asthma Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid Cytology The different techniques used to collect BALF (type, volume, and temperature of the fluids, how it is infused and aspirated from the lower airways \u2014sy- ringe, pump, or tube of videoendoscopy \u2014the method preparation \u2014cytospins, sedimentation,smears \u2014and staining of the cytopreparation, how the differential cell count is made, as well as the experi- ence of the cytologist) may in fluence the BALF differ- ential cell counts. are nouniversal \"normal values\" for BALF cytology in horses. Of note, lower airway in flammation may have numerous causes and represents a normalresponse to inhalation of irritants, noxious gas, andvarious microbes. For these reasons, lower airwayinflammation without the presence of abnormal clinical s i g n si sn o tc o n s i d e r e ds u f cient for a diagnosis of equine asthma. Nevertheless, the recent report thatincreased percentages of mast cells, and to a lesserextent, neutrophils, in BALF cytology of Thoroughbred racehorses was associated with decreased racing speed suggests that lower airway in flammation of any causes may lead to impaired performance. 6Inflammation documented from tracheal washes or aspirates is notconsidered appropriate for the diagnosis of equineasthma. 3 Tracheal Mucus on Endoscopy The presence of tracheal mucus has been associated with decreased performance in sport horses.7Excess tracheal mucus (score >1/5 for racehorses and >2/5 for sports/pleasure horses8)i sc o m m o ni nh o r s e sw i t h mild and moderate asthma,3but mucus accumulation may have many other causes. Therefore it has lowsensitivity and speci city for diagnosis of severe equine asthma, but its presence is suggestive of thecondition. 9 Airway Obstruction The poor performance caused by equine asthma results from a decreased gas exchange in the alveoli d u et oa i r flow impairment. The asthma diagnosis would therefore be based ideally on the documenta-tion of lower airway obstruction. Different methodshave been developed to measure the airway functionof horses. Bronchoprovocation with histamine 10or methacholine,11lung mechanics detected PaO 2and decreased VO 2peak dur- ing exercise14,15have been used for the diagnosis of mild and moderate equine asthma. However, theiruse is currently limited by the specialized equipmentand expertise they require, lack or portability, or com-mercial availability. Blood Biomarkers Blood biomarkers may facilitate the diagnosis of equine asthma in clinical practice as there is evi- dence of systemic in flammation in affected horses. While more work is needed, the combina-tion of acute phase proteins including serum amy-loid A (SAA), haptoglobin, and c-reactive protein(CRP), with lung speci cb i o m a r k e r ss u c ha ss u r - factant protein (SP)-D and secretoglobin, appearpromising. 16-18Of note, high concentrations of SAA and other acute phase proteins may be indic-ative of infection rather than equine asthma.HOW-TO SESSION: MEDICAL REASONS FOR POOR PERFORMANCE 200 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSPerformance Testing Performance testing is increasingly available at refer- ral centers or to individual practitioners and may help identify the cause of exercise intolerance. Diagnosticsmay include dynamic videoendoscopy with struc- tured exercise testing and exercising heart rate, VO 2peak, ECG, arterial blood gases, and stress echocardiography. Endobronchial Biopsies The presence of a remodeling of the epithelium, the lamina propria, and the bronchial smooth muscle layer in the central and peripheral airways of horses with severe asthma is well documented.5These structural changes correlate with decreased lungfunction in affected horses. Using endobronchial biopsies, which are easy to collect and are well toler- ated by horses during bronchoscopy, it was recentlyobserved that a remodeling of the airways is also pres-ent in the milder forms of asthma. 19Follow-up stud- ies would be required to determine whether these tissue changes allow prognosticating on the outcome o ra r eu s e f u lf o rt h ei m p l e m e n t a t i o no fs p e c i ct h e r - apy (precision medicine). 6. Conclusion Mild and moderate asthma are common and under- diagnosed causes of exercise intolerance in perform- ance horses. The diagnosis is based on the presenceof compatible clinical signs, lower airway in flamma- tion documented by BALF cytology, and the exclusion of other causes of exercise intolerance. Response to therapy may be required to con rm the diagnosis. Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of Veterinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

MEDICAL REASONS FOR POOR PERFORMANCE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 201How to Diagnose and Manage Gastric Ulcers as a Medical Reason for Poor Performance Frank M. Andrews, DVM, MS, DACVIM (LAIM) Poor athletic performance in horses is often multifactorial, and a comprehensive examination is needed to determine the cause. A comprehensive examination should include endoscopic examina- tion of the stomach to determine the presence of equine squamous gastric disease and/or equine glan-dular gastric disease, as they might be causing or contributing to the poor athletic performance. If gastric ulcers are present, then appropriate antiulcer treatment could improve stomach health and athletic performance.

Introduction Poor athletic performance in horses can be multifacto- rial, and it is dif cult to determine the effects of one component on athletic performance.1Thus, a com- prehensive clinical evaluation, at rest and during exercise, is needed to determine causes and prescribeeffective interventions. The gastrointestinal (GI)tract has largely been overlooked as a cause of poorathletic performance in horses. Nearly 60% of humanathletes complain of upper GI symptoms while exercis-ing, which likely affects performance. 2Several reports have implicated equine gastric ulcer syndrome(EGUS) as a cause of poor athletic performance inhorses, but only one of these studies collected objectivedata. 1,3,4 involves ulcerative Fig. 1). ESGD is similar togastroesophageal re flux disease (GERD) in humans, for which stomach acids are re fluxed onto the sensi- tive esophagus squamous mucosa. epithelium) is present inthe proximal one-third of the stomach and is not pro- tected by the lower esophageal sphincter and, there- fore, is constantly exposed to gastric acids(hydrochloric, volatile fatty, and bile acids). The con-dition of GERD is common in human athletes, and anumber of provocative physiological events, includingincreased gastric acid secretion, impaired gastric emp- tying, and increased internal gastric pressure, occur during exercise that exacerbate esophagealreflux. 6In fact, published epidemiological data on GERD indicate that upper GI symptoms occur in 58%of surveyed athletes, and these symptoms are propor-tional to exercise intensity. 2As exercise intensity increases and blood flow shifts away from the GI tract to working skeletal muscles, GI motor activity ismodied and gastric emptying is delayed. Factors NOTES 202 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: MEDICAL REASONS FOR POOR PERFORMANCEthat could explain exercise-induced gastroesophageal reflux in humans include the following: body position, which delays esophageal clearance as subjects shift away from the upright position (e.g., sprinter); increased abdominal pressure generated by theValsalva maneuver (i.e., weightlifters); or the bent-overracing position maintained by most cyclists. 6All of these activities can increase the abdominal component of the vectorial force, pushing gastric contents up against the lower esophageal sphincter. This scenariomight be similar in horses with ESGD duringexercise. Previously, Lorenzo-Figueras and Merritt 7 showed that intragastric pressure in horses sharply increased at a trot and gallop, which was due to increased intra-abdominal pressure related to theexercise. Increased abdominal pressure led toincreased gastric pressure, re fluxing acid stomach con- t e n t sa sm e a s u r e db yap Hp r o b ei n s e r t e di nt h es t o m - ach just distal to the lower esophageal sphincter. Re flux of acids on the squamous mucosa might explain the high prevalence of ESGD inracehorses. It is also consistent with the following observations: \u0081Squamous lesions regress or disappear when horses are taken out of training or are treatedwith acid-suppressing drugs. \u0081Lesions are most often found in the squamous mucosa near the margo plicatus on the lesser cur- vature, where acids are in constant contact withgastric mucosa. This \"how to \"article discusses the speci ca p p r o a c h for determining if EGUS is causing or contributing to poor athletic performance. The impact of EGGD onperformance remains to be determined. Comprehensive Approach A comprehensive examination to determine poor ath- letic performance should include a general physical ex- amination with a rebreathing examination, lamenessexamination, upper respiratory endoscopy examina- tion at rest without sedation and during work (dynamic endoscopy), blood work (hematology and bio- chemical panel), and an endoscopic examination of thedistal esophagus, stomach, and proximal duodenum. Clinical Signs Because the prevalence of EGUS is high in perform- ance horses and clinical signs are often vague, signs of EGUS are often subclinical and missed by trainersand owners. Clinical signs of EGUS typically include poor body and coat condition, weight loss, behavioral changes, mild colic, discomfort after eating, and reluc-tance to train. However, in a previous study in 4 horses with gastric ulcers as a cause of poor athletic performance, clinical signs were absent and there wasno evidence of abdominal pain, which makes it dif - cult to determine GI causes of poor performance. 1 Endoscopic Examination of the Distal Esophagus, Stomach, and Proximal Duodenum A thorough the distal esophagus, stomach, and proximal duodenum should be performed as part of a comprehensive athletic per- formance examination. The preparation, sedation,endoscopy procedure, and care postendoscopy areavailable online (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v= l_ZAxnxmE-0). Briefly, gastroscopy can be performed in the stand- ing and sedated horse or a horse under general anesthesia. 8To perform standing gastroscopy in the horse, feed, but not water, should be withheld for at least 8 -12 hours prior to the procedure. A muzzle should be placed on the horse during the feed-depriva- tion period to prevent ingestion of fecal material or re- sidual feed in the stall. All bedding and feed material should be removed from the stall during thefeed-deprivation period. Three people might beneeded to perform a thorough standing endoscopic ex- amination of the stomach; one person restrains the horse, one passes the endoscope, and one drives theendoscope. Xylazine (0.5 mg/kg bodyweight [bwt], Fig. 1. Summary of the terminology of describing erosive and ulcerative diseases of the horse stomach (with permission).5HOW-TO SESSION: MEDICAL REASONS FOR POOR PERFORMANCE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 203IV) or (0.02 mg/kg bwt, IV) can be administered prior to the procedure, and the horse is left undisturbed until sedation is observed. A twitch might be applied to the horse 's muzzle on the opposite side from which the endoscope is to be passed. Endoscopy of the stom-ach should be performed using a 3 m or longer endo- scope, as shorter endoscopes do not provide a complete view of the stomach and proximal duodenum. To improve visualization of the stomach and of can be insuf flated using the air-feed directly from the endoscope or an air compressorattached to the endoscope biopsy channel (until the rugae or stomach folds disappear). Mucosa should be rinsed of adherent feed material and mucus using tap water flushed through the endoscope biopsy channel using 60-ml syringes or fluid pump. Ulcers might be seen under adherent feed material and mucus and might be obscured by debris. When horses are dif - cult to handle, are under general anesthesia for abdom-inal surgery, or when a complete examination of the stomach is not possible standing, endoscopy can be per- formed under general anesthesia. To perform endos- copy under general anesthesia, it is best to place the horse in right lateral recumbency so that the stomachis up. The horse can be rolled up on its back and then t ot h el e f ts i d es ot h a ta l lo ft h es t o m a c hc a nb eviewed. Orienting oneself to the anatomy can be more challenging than in the standing horse. Care must be taken not to overinsuf flate the stomach, as this could result in air escaping into the small andlarge intestine, resulting in bloating and abdominalpain during recovery. Residual air should be removed from the stomach after the procedure to prevent colic or other complications. 9Ulcerations, hyperkeratosis, and hyperemia should be recorded, and a scoring sys-tem can be used to keep track of severity. Severalscoring systems are available for use and include the one recommended by the EGUS Council and European C o l l e g eo fE q u i n eI n t e r n a lM e d i c i n e( T a b l e1 ) 10,11that evaluates the size of ulcers. Another scoring systemevaluating lesion number and severity can also be usedfor both squamous and glandular regions of the stom-ach (Table 2). 5In addition, EGGD can be described using another system (Table 3).11The advantage of recording ulcer scores is to assess improvement or wor-sening on follow-up examinations. The presence ofgastric ulcers on endoscopic examination does not con-rm cause and effect, as ulcers could be secondary to o t h e rc a u s e so fp o o rp e r f o r m a n c e . Measuring Gastric Juice pH Upon endoscope entry into the stomach and before insufflation or flushing with tap water, one can aspi- rate gastric fluid from the biopsy channel and mea- sure pH within 2 hours by using a benchtop pH meter, pH paper, or a urine dipstick, with pH disk. Measuring gastric juice pH, especially in horses treated with antiulcer medications, is impor-tant to determine if treatment with acid-suppressingdrugs is effective. A pH of 4.0 is desirable, and it has been shown that a pH <4.0 can damage the squa- mous stomach mucosa. 12 Other Diagnostic Testing Hematology There are no clinicopathologic parameters that are pa- thognomonic for EGUS as a cause of poor athletic performance. However, hematology, at theTable 1.

In one report, 3 of 4horses presenting for poor performance due to EGUShad hemoglobin concentrations below the referencerange. 1In another study, horses with EGUS had sig- nicantly lower red blood cell counts and hemoglobin concentrations than horses without EGUS.13Unfortunately, these values were not outside reference ranges. In addition, previous epidemiological studies have failed to nd an association between hema- tological parameters and poor athletic performance in populations of racehorses.3 Fecal Occult Blood Testing It is probably worth mentioning the use of fecal occult blood to determine horses with EGUS. A guaiac- based fecal occult blood test was used in one studya n ds h o w e dh i g hs p e c i city, low sensitivity, and high false-negative results for determining the location ofulceration (stomach or colon). 14Also, in a recent study, there was a high number of false-negative tests, and no signi cant correlation was found between results of a new fecal blood test and gastric ulcer scores in horses undergoing stall con nement and bolus feeding.15 2. Treatment T h eg o l ds t a n d a r df o rt h et r e a t m e n to fh o r s e sw i t h EGUS is omeprazole.aHowever, other pharma- cologic agents have been used for the treatment and prevention of EGUS with variable success(Table 4).In the study by Franklin et al., 1allhorses presenting with poor performance due to EGUS had severe ESGD and mild-to-moderate EGGD. All horses were treated with omeprazole paste (4 mg/kg bwt, orally daily) and one horse received sucralfate (20 mg/kg bwt, orally twice daily), and all returned to racing after treatment. Two of the 4 horses in that study hadfollow-up gastroscopy and the squamous ulcers healed, whereas the glandular mucosa still had hyperemia in 1 horse and was healed in the other horse. Improvement in athletic performance was documented by an increase in mean Raceform rating and increased earnings after treatment.1It should be noted that omeprazole has no performance-enhancing properties byitself, as con rmed by a previous study.17A recent study in human runners addressed theeffect of GERD and treatment with antisecretory agents on poor performance.18In that study, runners with frequent GERD had a signi cantly decreased time to exhaustion compared to run- re flux. However, prophylactic rabeprazole (omeprazole-like proton-pump inhibi-tor) administration did not improve performance in the runners with GERD. Therefore, treat- ment in these human athletes did not result in a signi cant effect on performance. The authors speculated that decreased performance in humanathletes with GERD might be caused by esopha- geal pain and not stomach pain. In contrast, because the squamous mucosa is located in the stomach, stomach pain (due to acid re flux and re- s u l t a n tE S G D )m i g h tb et h ec a u s eo fp o o rTable 3.

Recent investigations have shown a reduced ef cacy in omeprazole- treated horses with EGGD, when compared withESGD.19Only 36% of EGGD cases healed when treated with omeprazole (4 mg/kg, orally every24 hours) compared with a 78% healing rate in horses with diagnosed ESGD.20The reason for thisnding is not known but is likely a re flection of the different pathogenesis causing EGGD, and therefore, EGGD is considered a related but dis- tinct disease from ESGD. Because of the poorresponse of EGGD to omeprazole administration, sucralfate has been recommended for treatment. It should be noted that sucralfate, as a monotherapy, was shown to be ineffective in improving foals with ESGD lesions21but has ef cacy in treatment of EGGD.11Sucralfate binds to stomach ulcers and promotes healing. Sucralfate is an aluminum mechanism of action involves adher- ence to ulcerated to ing in 63% of horses with EGGD grade 2a n d improvement of at least 1 grade in 83% of horses withEGGD grade 2. 19,22 The synthetic prostaglandin E2 analogue misopros- tol has been recommended for use in treatingEGUS.11Misoprostol is a methylester analogue of prostaglandin, and it showed a time-dependentincrease in the basal gastric pH in horses. Misoprostol enhances mucosal protection by stimulating mucus and bicarbonate production and might aid in the treatment and prevention of EGGD.23A recent report showed that misoprostol signi cantly inhibited in flammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor interleukin-1 b, and interleukin-6, and superoxide) produced ex vivo from equine leukocytes lipopoly-saccharide.24This study showed that misoprostol has anti-in flammatory effects that might be effective for treating EGGD because lesions in the glandular mu- cosa are frequently in flammatory. In more recent studies, misoprostol (5 mg/kg bwt, orally every 12 hours) was found to be superior to combined omeprazole (4 mg/ kg, orally every 24 hours) and sucralfate (12 mg/kg, orally every 12 hours) therapy in horses with EGGD.19,25,26Misoprostol might cause diarrhea and/or colic signs and should not be used in pregnant mares because it might induce parturition and termination of the pregnancy. 3. Antibiotic Treatment of Chronic ESGD and EGGD Helicobacter pylori and other Helicobacter spp. been shown to cause ESGD or EGGD, althoughHelicobacter DNA has been isolated from the stomach and feces of horses.27Instead, other resident, acid-tolerant bacteria ( Escherichia coli ,Lactobacillus spp., andStreptococcus spp.) are suspected to contribute to the worsening of squamous ulcers.28In that study, bacteria were isolated from the gastric contents of horses with spontaneous ESGD that were fed a high-concentrate diet. It was found that trimethoprimsulfadimidine (15 mg/kg bwt, orally, once daily)decreased EGSD ulcer numbers and severity com-pared to untreated control horses. These data sug-gest that resident stomach bacteria are importantfor the maintenance and progression ofEGSD. However, once-daily administration of trime-thoprim-sulfadimidine did not improve healing of EGGD in horses receiving omeprazole. 29The author has used trimethoprim sulfadiazine (15 -20 mg/kg orally, twice daily) nonrespon- sive ESGD. Recently, doxycycline (10 mg/kg bwt,orally twice lesions are in flammatory in nature, and recently, it was shown that EGGD lesions might be colonized byresident bacteria.31Antibiotics should be used responsibly and only when acid-suppressive therapy alone is not effective. 4. Prevention Prevention of ulcer recurrence is important, as in one study squamous ulcers recurred within 8 days after discontinuing omeprazole treatment in horsesengaged in light and heavy training regimes.32The use of low-dose omeprazole (1 mg/kg bwt, orally, q24h)has been shown to recurrence of ESGD.33In a recent meta-analysis study, omeprazole prophylaxisin active training horses signi cantly reduced gastric ulceration compared with no prophylaxis (sham), withthe absolute effect of 566 fewer ulcers per 1000 horsestreated. 34 5. Management Management changes may be more cost effective but difcult, especially in Thoroughbred racehorses housed in stalls. To reduce gastric acidity, horses can be provided access to pasture grazing, fed ad libi- tum forage, and provided smaller and more frequent concentrate feedings. Serum gastrin concentrationsare high in horses fed high-concentrate (grain)diets. Large bolus grain feeding can increase solublecarbohydrates in the stomach, which are fermentedby resident stomach bacteria ( Lactobacillus spp.), resulting in the production of volatile fatty acids,which in the presence of low stomach pH ( 4), have been shown to cause acid damage to the squamousmuscosa. 12Ap r e v i o u ss t u d y ,u s i n ga n in vitro model, showed that feeding grain at greater than0.5 kg/100 kg bwt every 5 hours resulted in volatilefatty acid concentrations above the threshold (20 mmol),which led to acid damage, as indicated by changes inHOW-TO SESSION: MEDICAL REASONS FOR POOR PERFORMANCE 206 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSsquamous tissue bioelectrical properties.35Thus, smaller grain feedings every 5 to 6 hours may help in the prevention of EGUS. Regarding EGGD, whenmanagement factors associated with EGGD were eval- uated, dietary factors were not included in the nal mul- tivariable models, suggesting that dietary factors may be less important for the control of EGGD than for the con- trol of ESGD.19However, decreased pasture turnout or increased grain concentrate frequency were retained in the univariate model and might be associated with EGGD.36,37Therefore, increasing pasture turnout and decreasing grain concentrates might be useful manage- ment strategies for preventing EGGD.19In the previ- o u ss t u d y ,h o r s e sw i t hE G U Sa sac a u s eo fp o o rperformance were managed with increased pasture graz-ing and showed improvement in EGGD. 1Another die- tary strategy, feeding alfalfa hay, has been shown to decrease gastric ulcers in horses. A previous study showed that horses fed an alfalfa hay/grain diet had sig-nicantly higher stomach pH (for 5 hours after feeding) and fewer, less severe gastric ulcers than horses fedbrome grass hay. 38In a more recent study, horses fed alfalfa hay and exercised showed decreased gastric ulcer scores compared to horses fed a coastal hay diet.39Thus, feeding alfalfa, because of its superior buf- fering capacity (high calcium and protein concentra- tions), may protect the squamous mucosa from acid d a m a g e . T h e r ea r en os t u d i e so nt h ee f f e c to fa l f a l f ahay on EGGD. Intense exercise, racing, and race train-ing have been shown to contribute to worsening of ESGD; thus, taking the horse out of training, reducing exercise intensity, and incorporating pasture turnoutmight improve ESGD. 40However, there are no studies showing that exercise intensity or exercise restrictionhas any effect on EGGD. In summary, gastric ulcer- ation, part of EGUS, is common in racehorses throughout the world and has been linked to poor athletic performance. It should be emphasized thatEGUS could be the sole cause of poor athletic perform-ance, but it also could contribute to or be secondary to other causes of poor performance. Omeprazole is the treatment of choice; however, complementary phar-maceutical agents such as sucralfate and misopr- ostol might improve healing in horses with EGGD. Because ulcers will likely return after cessa-tion of treatment, prophylaxis with a low dose of ome- prazole (1 -2 mg/kg bwt, orally daily) is bene cial for long-term prevention of recurrence. Management, such as increasing pasture turnout and decreasing di- etary concentrate feeding, is suggested, but more research is needed to determine which managements t r a t e g i e sa r ee f f e c t i v ea n dw h i c ho n e sa r eo ft h egreatest bene t for maintaining a high level of ath- letic performance.

Background Neuroaxonal degeneration in brainstem and spi- nal cord of horses, termed equine degenerative mye-loencephalopathy (EDM) or neuroaxonal dystrophy(NAD), has been reported sporadically inthe equine veterinary literature for over40 years. Eventually, consensus developed thatthese two conditions have such striking clinicaland pathologic similarities that NAD should beconsidered a localized form of EDM in which de-generative changes in the spinal cord are subtleand easily overlooked. 1,2Disease has been described in equids of many different breeds, withfamilial or genetic causes suspected. Theauthor 's impression is that NAD/EDM was a com- mon pathologic diagnosis when the disease wasrst described and then less commonly recog- nized, only to resurge in the last de-cade. Whether this resurgence is because of truechanges in disease incidence or because ofchanges in clinical suspicion or knowledge of thedisease is unclear. In the author 's practice (New Bolton Center [NBC]), there is an increasing diag-nosis of NAD/EDM, and affected horses have dif-ferent clinical presentations from those in earlierliterature. These proceedings will focus on clini-cal observations from recent years, with a briefreview of existing literature. For simplicity, thed i s e a s ew i l lb er e f e r r e dt oa sE D M .2. Prevalence and Signalment Therst report of EDM described young horses of sev- eral breeds as well as a zebra.3After its recognition, EDM was considered a common neurologic disease ofhorses, representing 23/96 (24%) of horses with spinalcord disease evaluated at Cornell from 1974 to1976. 4A later report indicated that EDM remained the most common cause of spinal cord disease inhorses at Cornell University; it was diagnosed clini-cally in 171/383 (45%) horses and histologically in140/287 (49%) horses from 1977 to 1987. 5Early reports of EDM described the onset of clinical signs from birth to 1.2 years of age, with a mean onset at 0.4 years.4Likewise, out of 43 horses with EDM reported at Cornell from 1978 to 1987, ownersreported that approximately 80% showed clinicalsigns by 14 months of age. However, a few outlierswere identi ed, with 3 horses reported by owners to develop signs at 5, 7, and 12 years of age. 6As time went on, familial predisposition to EDM was horses. 7Approximately 90 horses clini- cally evaluated at NBC from 2016 to 2020 had a nal post-mortem diagnosis of EDM, with the numberincreasing each year (2016, 4 horses; 2017, 6 horses;2018, 12 horses; 2019, 28 horses; 2020, 40horses). Contrary to previous reports, most of the NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 209HOW-TO SESSION: MEDICAL REASONS FOR POOR PREFORMANCEsport horses diagnosed by the author are between 5 and 15 years of age, with young to middle-aged Warmbloods making up the bulk of cases diagnosed at NBC. However, Quarter Horses, Standardbreds, Thoroughbreds, Arabians, and horses of many other breeds have also been diagnosed. It is possible that EDM has a delayed onset in Warmbloods, but it is also possible that the perceived later onset is due to management and training differences, causing subtle abnormalities to be missed early in life that only becomes evident when workload and level of perform- ance increase. Many of the Warmblood sport horses diagnosed with EDM have been imported from Europe, but they are not from a consistent region, of a consistent breed, or in the same family line. Importantly, American-bred horses, both Warmbloods and many other breeds, are also affected by this condition. 3. History Obtaining a thorough history from people familiar with the horse, including owner, trainer, rider, and manager, is very helpful for diagnosing EDM. Although not observed in every case, behavior changes are a very common clinical fea- ture that should alert the veterinarian to the pos- sibility of EDM. The behavior changes cannot always be detected by people less familiar with the horse 's\"normal \"behavior, and hence, veteri- narians should listen carefully to the observationsof those who know the horse well. \"Personality\" changes are common, including changes in the horse 's general level of awareness, reaction to stimuli, and interactions with people, ani- mals, and the environment. Many horses eventually diagnosed with EDM are purchased because they are initially perceived to be calm and quiet. Some horses become increasingly dull and lethargic, to the point of appearing sedated, and they seem to lose interest in social interactions with people and other horses. This overly dull/sedate behavior might be interspersed with periods of uncharacteristic anxiety,spookiness, and aggression toward horses, other ani- mals, or people. Other horses appear to be persis- tently anxious or on edge, often becoming cranky or aggressive. Owners frequently comment \"he'sn o t the same horse he used to be. \" Bad behavior under saddle is frequently the rst sign detected. Horses often start spooking unpre- dictably and severely. This spookiness might lead clients to suspect eye problems, but ophthalmic exam is usually normal. Many of these horses were consid- ered unusually calm before the onset of uncharacteris- tic spooking. Even professional riders can rarely predict (or recognize in hindsight) the stimulus for the spook. Although some horses become very reactive to sound and others reactive to visual stimuli, many spook for no apparent reason, often after they have gone past an area uneventfully several times. For example, a horse might canter over a line of fences three times and then on the fourth spook violently inbetween fences. In addition to excessive and unpre-dictable spookiness, other bad behaviors are common, including bucking, bolting, rearing, spinning, refusing fences, and becoming unwilling to stand at the mount- ing block. Importantly, these bad behaviors are a marked change from the horse' sn o r m a lb e h a v i o ra n d are usually unprovoked and unpredictable. Owners frequently use descriptions such as \"it was like a switch flipped\" or\"it was like he didn 't know where he was or what happened -he had a glazed/vacant expression \" when they describe the episodes. Sometimes clientsdetect signs that might indicate ataxia and sometimes they do not. It is more common for behavior changes to be the primary reason for evaluation, but suspected lameness or loss of coordination can be the primary complaint. Horses might start knocking rails, strug-gle with lateral movements, have dif culty holding leads at a canter or changing leads, or feelweak. Tripping with the thoracic limbs and \"falling out behind\" (tripping, stumbling, or buckling with the pelvic limbs) are common observations. Additional client observations include topline musculature that seems underdeveloped or atrophied and haircoatchanges such as a long or dull haircoat. These changes can be reminiscent of a horse with pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) and sometimes prompt endocrine testing despite the relatively younga ge of the horse. Other clients have observed changes in behavior that might result from sensory abnormal-ities, including abnormal reactions to grooming orbeing sprayed with water, a perceived inability to sense temperature changes, and abnormal reactions to pres- sure when asked to move away from the hand on the ground or the leg under saddle. 4. Clinical Signs Initial descriptions of EDM reported symmetric tetra- paresis and ataxia, generally noticed between birth and 1 year of age.3These signs re flected upper motor neuron and general proprioceptive tract lesions,with no evidence of cranial nerve, cerebral, or lar involvement. Hypalgesia, hypotonia, hypore- flexia, or muscle atrophy were not observed. These signs were considered indistinguishable from those caused by other focal, multifocal, or diffuse myelopa- thies affecting the cervical spinal cord. However, most focal myelopathies cause de cits that are slightly more severe in the pelvic limbs than in thethoracic limbs, whereas horses with EDM were often observed to have de cits in the thoracic limbs that were either similar in severity to those in the pelvic limbs or much less severe than those in the pelvic limbs, with a bigger disparity than would be expected for a focal compressive lesion. Curiously, a subse- quent report described ataxia but with signi cant hypore flexia over the neck and trunk, particularly in horses with a longer duration ofclinical signs. 8This hypore flexia was evident during assessment (slap), and cutaneous trunci SESSION: MEDICAL REASONS FOR PREFORMANCE 210 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSauthor 's experience, horses with EDM as the sole problem usually appear to be systemically healthy and often are well conditioned or overconditioned, and some have a phenotype consistent with equine meta-bolic syndrome. Additionally, some relatively younghorses diagnosed with EDM have phenotypic charac-teristics more commonly associated with PPID,including topline muscle wasting and a long, dullhaircoat. Even though most owners and trainersobserve convincing behavior changes, the horse mightappear normal in terms of mental status and behaviorduring veterinary examination. However, somehorses appear unusually dull or sedate duringexamination. Other horses appear overly anxiousand inappropriately spooky when considering theirage, breed, and previous experiences. Cranialnerve assessment is usually normal. Rarely,horses will have an inconsistent menace responseor hyperreactive menace response with rapidrepeated (clonic) blinking. Spinal re flexes are usually normal, although the cervicofacial re flex might be subjectively decreased. Cervical rangeof motion is typically normal unless concurrent cer-vical arthritis is present. Dynamic gait evalua-tion typically reveals proprioceptive de cits and signs of mild-to-moderate ataxia and paresis con-sistent with a cervical or diffuse myelo-pathy. Most horses are graded 1 to 2/5 on themodi ed Mayhew ataxia scale at the time of rst evaluation, although occasionally horses showmore severe de cits (2.5 to 3/5). Repeated evalua- tions over months might show a progression of neu-rologic disease. Evaluation at the walk mostfrequently reveals a normal-to-long gait,sometimes with a \"floaty flipping ap- Horses might show irregular footplacement, occasional limb interference, orforging. These signs might be exacerbated by walking with head elevation. Circling the horse in hand tightly in both directions is usually themost helpful test to detect proprioceptivedecits. Horses often show delayed protraction, such that their body leans to the side, but they areslow to initiate limb movement \u2014their feet never seem to catch up with their center ofgravity. Limb interference might be seen fromthe level of the hocks/carpi down to thehooves. The toe of the outside limb might scuff ordrag on the ground as it is widely and spasticallyswung into position. The inside foot might pivotfor an abnormally long time on the ground. Whenthe horse is stopped suddenly or asked to rapidlychange direction, excessive truncal sway and lossof balance might be observed. Horses often spon-taneously place their limbs in unusual positionsrelative to their center of gravity and then fail toreplace them in a more normal position. De cits are often more obvious in the pelvic limbs than tho-racic limbs. When walked down a hill, particu-larly with head elevation, the horse mightoverreach or search for the ground with its frontfeet while scuf ng, sinking, or buckling with its pelvic limbs. When observed at the trot, the horse might appear more bouncy or spastic thanexpected, with dif culty moving in a straight line and a tendency to drift in either direction. 5. Differential Diagnoses Horses with EDM might be presented for bad behav- ior under saddle, poor performance, or poor movement and suspicion of lameness. The list of problems thatcan cause these types of complaints is ex-tensive. The author strongly believes that most horses are quite willing and eager to please and that development of bad behavior in a horse that previ-ously performed well is almost always related to amedical problem. Marked behavior changes in ahorse that has undergone no major environmental ortraining changes are almost always due to pain or brain disease. Therefore, if the primary complaint is abnormal behavior, the owner should be carefullyquestioned and the horse should be carefully observedfor evidence of neck, back, limb, or abdominalpain. The author nds 24-hour video monitoring with behavioral analysis to be helpful with manycases; horses sometimes show very demonstrative andlocalizing pain behaviors when barns are quiet and noone is interacting with them. If the horse is pre-sented for a vaguer complaint of poor performance or poor movement, careful and potentially repeated or- thopedic and neurologic examinations are necessary todetermine whether the poor performance and abnor-mal gait are due to orthopedic disease alone, neurologicdisease alone, or a combination of both. Lameness diagnostics such as local anesthesia can help con rm an orthopedic source and narrow down differential diagnoses. If the gait abnormality is not severeenough to assess the effects of local anesthesia (not\"blockable \"), a phenylbutazone trial might yield helpful information. If the horse 's performance improves on phenylbutazone, orthopedic and potentially other pain-ful problems should be investigated. If signs of pro-prioceptive de cits and ataxia are clearly present, neurologic causes of poor performance and behaviorchanges should be considered. Horses with EDM typ- ically have a chronic course of disease and often have not been right for months. Ataxia typically is sym-metric and affects all four limbs, although the pelviclimbs might be more obviously affected. In theauthor 's practice, most horses with symmetric proprio- ceptive ataxia of a duration of multiple weeks have oneof three following categories of disease: (1) compressivemyelopathy, usually due to cervical vertebral stenoticmyelopathy (CVSM); (2) infectious myelitis, usuallyd u et oe q u i n ep r o t o z o a lm y e l o e n c e p h a l i t i s( E P M )caused by Sarcocystis neurona; or (3) degenerative myeloencephalopathy (EDM/NAD). Therefore, diag-nostic testing is aimed at differentiating between thesethree types of diseases.HOW-TO SESSION: MEDICAL REASONS FOR POOR PREFORMANCE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 2116. Laboratory Results Standard hematologic tests, including complete blood cell count, serum amyloid A, brinogen, and chemistry panel, generally yield unremarkable results unless comorbidities exist. Cerebrospinalfluid (CSF) collection is strongly recommended for horses with neurologic disease, and results canconrm or refute the presence of infectious neurologic disease, with EPM being the infectious disease of mostconcern. Horses with EDM usually have a normalCSF nucleated cell count (NCC; <5c e l l s / mL) and nor- cytology (very low number of mononuclear cells,without neutrophils, eosinophils, or be normal ( <90 mg/dL) or mildly increased; these mild increases are typically inthe 90- to 120-mg/dL range. If CSF cytology is abnor-mal, with increased NCC indicating meningitis, infec-tious viral and bacterial diseases should be stronglyconsidered. EPM is the most common infectiousequine neurologic disease in North America, and spe-cic testing should be considered in most areas of the United States. 9Horses with EDM might be negative or positive on EPM serologic tests, depending on expo-sure status. Generally, negative serologic results havea high negative predictive value and rule outEPM. Rare exceptions exist in horses with immunode- ciencies or recent infection, and con rmation with CSF testing should be considered if CSF is available. Positive serologic results have a low posi-tive predictive value but indicate the need for furthertesting, and more accurate assessment of EPM statusshould be pursued, ideally by using quantitative anti-body testing on paired serum and CSF samples todetect intrathecal antibody production. Although arare cause of neurologic disease in horses, Lyme diseaseis a frequent concern of clients and theoretically couldcause both behavior changes and ataxia. 10Horses with EDM might be negative or positive on Lyme serol-ogy, depending on exposure status. Diagnosis of neu-roborreliosis is very challenging in horses, and antibodylevels are not necessarily predictive. 11Because most true neuroborreliosis cases have abnormal CSF cytol-ogy, with neutrophilic or lymphocytic pleocytosis, theauthor generally discounts Lyme disease as the pri-mary cause of neurologic de cits if CSF cytology is nor- mal, regardless of serum and CSF antibody levelsagainst Borrelia burgdorferi .V i t a m i n E d e ciency has been associated with EDM, and vitamin E concen-tration should be assessed in suspect cases. 7Low vita- min E concentration (less than 2 ppm or 200 mg/dL) is supportive of EDM diagnosis, particularly when other causes of neurologic disease have been excluded. However, adequate vitamin E statusdoes not preclude the diagnosis of EDM. Manyhorses diagnosed by the author have vitamin Econcentrations well within the normal range atthe time of diagnosis. It is possible that thesehorses were de cient in utero or during early stages of their lives, contributing to diseasedevelopment. The utility of biomarkers such asphosphorylated neuro lament heavy (pNF-H) for diagnosis of equine neurologic disease, including EDM, is under investigation. 12Current evidence suggests that abnormally high concentrations of pNF-H in serum and CSF are suggestive of EDMif diseases such as EPM have been ex-cluded. However, pNF-H testing has a low sensi-tivity for EDM diagnosis, and many con rmed cases have normal pNF-H concentrations in blood,spinal fluid, or both. 7. Imaging Results Survey cervical radiography, cervical myelography, and sometimes cervical myelography-computed tomography are used to assess for CVSM. One ofthe major challenges in EDM diagnosis is thataffected horses might also have cervical arthritis,CVSM, or both. Normal survey cervical radio-graphs and/or negative cervical myelography makeCVSM highly unlikely and increase clinical suspicionfor EDM, assuming infectious causes of disease arealso excluded. Unfortunately, abnormal cervical radio- graphs and even positive cervical myelography do not exclude the possibility of EDM because false-positivemyelograms are possible and horses can be affectedby both diseases simultaneously. With increasingrecognition of EDM, the author has become more cau-tious in recommending surgical cervical fusion forhorses with equivocal ( \"gray zone \")m y e l o g r a m sa n d horses with positive myelograms but behaviorchanges suggestive of EDM. currently requires post-mortem exam- ination, but the characteristic degenerative changes can be missed if the pathologist is inexperienced orthe brainstem is not carefully evaluated.

In the author 'se x p e r i e n c ew i t h sport horses, the brainstem changes are most consist-ent, particularly in the lateral cuneate nuclei, whereasspinal cord lesions are minimal or dif cult to detect. 9. Summary EDM remains a common cause of neurologic diseasein the horse but is almost certainly underdiag-nosed due to the challenges in antemortemdiagnosis. Practitioners should maintain a highdegree of suspicion for this disease in horses withbehavior changes and mild-to-moderate ataxia orin any horse with relatively symmetric ataxia thatlacks evidence for infectious disease or spinal cordcompression. Diagnosis in the living horse isbased primarily on exclusion of other potentialdifferential diagnoses through CSF analysis and appropriate imaging. Post-mortem diagnosis requires an experienced pathologist and carefulattention to the brainstem, where degenerativechanges are most evident.

Introduction Exertional muscle disorders cause muscle pain and/or weakness that impair athletic performance. Onesubset of exertional myopathies, exertional rhabdo-myolysis, by intolerance without elevations inserum CK and AST activities. 1,2The lack of a readily available blood test to screen these horses for a myop-athy and the overlap in clinical signs with other disor-ders necessitate a detailed diagnostic work up to ruleout other more common causes of exercise intolerancebefore proceeding to a muscle biopsy. 2. What is MFM? Myobrils contain myo laments aligned within con- tractile units called sarcomeres that are bordered by Zdiscs. Z discs provide structural support as well asmechanosignaling whereby tension during musclecontractions sends Z disc proteins to the nucleusthat activate genes which initiate trainingadaptations. 3Desmin is a cytoskeletal proteinlocated at the Z disc that aligns adjacentsarcomeres. Horses with MFM have disruptedmyobrillar alignment within the sarcomere, Z disc disruption, and ectopic accumulation of des-min in type 2A (fast-twitch oxidative) mus-clebers. 2Muscle cytoplasmic aggregatesof glycogen, and proteomic studies from MFM Warmbloodsuggest that the basis for MFM could be aberrantgene and protein expression that impact molecular signaling, the alignment of contractile proteins, mito- chondrial function, and oxidative stress. 4This hy- however, requires further investigation. 3. Are PSSM2 and MFM the Same Disease in Warmbloods? Type 1 polysaccharide storage myopathy (PSSM1) refers to horses with excessive muscle glycogen con-centrations, abnormal amylase-resistant polysaccha-ride in muscle histology, 1 gene (GYS1 ). 5,6The term PSSM2 is applied to horses with abnormal appearing glycogenaggregates in muscle biopsies that do not possess theGYS1 mutation. 7PSSM2 in essence represents a NOTES 214 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: MEDICAL REASONS FOR POOR PERFORMANCEhistologic description of glycogen aggregates in horses with exercise intolerance rather than a speci c disease. To determine if PSSM2, like PSSM1, isassociated with excessive glycogen storage, glycogenconcentrations recently have been measured in a vari-ety of breeds diagnosed with PSSM2. Mean glycogenconcentrations in Quarter Horses diagnosed with PSSM2 (n = 67, 130 660 mmol/kg) were found to be lower than those of PSSM1 Quarter Horses (n = 20, 175639 mmol/kg) and signi cantly higher than con- trol Quarter Horses (n = 185, 80 627 mmol/kg). a Glycogen concentrations in Warmblood and Arabianhorses with PSSM2, however, were found to be simi-lar to those in control horses. 8-10Thus, the term PSSM2 is a histologic descriptor that may encompass different diseases in different breeds. Further research into PSSM2 found that some PSSM2Warmbloods have aggregates of desmin, myo brillar disarray, and Z disc streaming resembling a conditiondescribed in humans as MFM. 2Because clinical signs of exercise intolerance are very similar betweenWarmblood horses with PSSM2 and MFM, and horseswith MFM can have glycogen aggregates resemblingPSSM2, it is suspected that PSSM2 in Warmbloods potentially represents an earlier stage of MFM. 1,2 However, more research is required to state this denitively. The aggregates of amylase-sensitive glycogen used to diagnose PSSM2 in Warmbloodscould occur because of pooling of glycogen in breaks within the myo brils seen in electron microscopy of MFM horses.2 4. Clinical Signs of PSSM2 and MFM Warmblood horses diagnosed with PSSM2 and MFM have an insidious onset of exercise intolerance notable by 6 to 8 years of age characterized by a lack of stam-ina, unwillingness to go forward, inability to collect,abnormal canter transitions, and inability to sustainan o r m a lc a n t e r . 1,2Stiffness, muscle pain, and rarely an episode of exertional rhabdomyolysis are reported with PSSM2 and MFM as well as a hindlimb lame- ness that remains unresolved after a thorough ortho-pedic assessment. 1Serum CK and AST activities are usually within normal limits unless samples aretaken in conjunction with rare episodes of exertionalrhabdomyolysis. 5. Diagnosis A physical examination that includes a full lameness and neurologic examination is strongly recommended prior to pursuing a diagnosis of PSSM2 or MFM (Fig. 1).11This is because other causes of poor perform- a n c ea r em u c hm o r ec o m m o nt h a nP S S M 2a n dM F Mand because the sensitivity and speci city of muscle Fig. 1.

Tack and saddle t should be inspected, and the horse should be observed under-saddle to determine if there are potential rider, training, or behavioral issues that are primary con- tributors to poor performance.11Other potential diagnostics include endoscopy to rule out gastric ulcers, diagnostic joint/nerve blocks for associated lameness, radiography, ultrasonography, and scintigraphy. Inthe absence of other causes of reluctance to go forwardand engage the hind quarters, a treatment trial of management changes or a muscle biopsy are reasona- ble next steps (Fig. 1). One potential complication ofa treatment trial is that, unlike PSSM1, aggregates of polysaccharide and desmin appear to decrease with the prescribed management, leading to a potentialfalse-negative diagnosis if biopsies are pursued after initiating appropriate management. b Muscle Biopsy Either the gluteal muscle or the semimembranosus/ tendinosis muscles are sampled to diagnose PSSM2and MFM. A sample that provides a 2-cm square of tissue in cross-section is recommended in order to pro- vide enough muscle bers to identify the limited num- ber of type 2A bers that contain glycogen or desmin aggregates.2It is recommended that both fresh and formalin- xed samples be evaluated with a minimum of hematoxylin-eosin, periodic acid Schiff 's( P A S ) ,a m - ylase-PAS, and desmin stains.2Handling of muscle tissue is extremely important. It is recommendedt h a t1 )t h es a m p l eb eh a n d l e dw i t hf o r c e p sa to n l yo n eend, 2) the sample is not squeezed with forceps, 3) the samples be placed in slightly damp gauze in a hard container (urine cup) packed with enough gauze toprevent movement during shipping, 4) the samples bekept chilled on ice packs until shipping, and 5) the samples should be shipped overnight to arrive in the laboratory within 24 hours. Squeezing of muscle cre-ates abnormal glycogen (false positives) and delays in chilling or shipping result in glycogen and desmin depletion (false negatives) as well as artifactual crackswithin muscle cells that stain positively with PAS (false positives). aPrior to placing samples in formalin, b e s tp r a c t i c e ss u g g e s tt h es a m p l eb ea l l o w e dt os i ti n air for 3 to 5 minutes to fully contract. The diagnos- tic criteria for PSSM2 include the presence of aggre- gates of cytoplasmic glycogen in PAS stains and anegative GYS1 test.7The aggregates of glycogen are usually amylase sensitive (similar to normal glycogen), in contrast to amylase-resistant aggre- gates seen in PSSM1.5Because amylase-sensi- tive glycogen is a normal feature of muscle histology, the interpretation of the appearance of glycogen is a subjective diagnosis. The diagnos-tic criterion for MFM is the presence of aggregates of cytoplasmic desmin that are at least one-half the width of myonuclei in size and found inmature (not regenerating) muscle bers. 2It is the author 's clinical impression that these desmin aggregates are not concurrent with the initialclinical signs of exercise intolerance, and thus it is possible to have a false-negative diagnosis of MFM in early stages. Genetic Testing Mutations in 16 genes are known to cause MFM in humans.12A comparison of the sequences of these 16 genes (including MYOT and FLNC ) between horses diagnosed with MFM by muscle biopsy (n = 8) and healthy Warmblood horses (N = 8) did not identifyany mutations associated with MFM in the horses studied.13A commercial company offers genetic test- ing for variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in the causative of and MFM (http://equiseq.com/buy_pssm2). The prevalence of Warmblood horses with a muscle biopsy diagnosisof PSSM2 (n = 54) and MFM (n = 68) and no histopa- thology (n = 54) as well as in 205 horses in publicly available genetic databases has recently beendetermined. 14No statistical association was found between any of the P variants, or combinations of P variants, and the presence of either PSSM2 or MFM considered as one diagnosis, or when PSSM2 orMFM were considered separately. Only 38% ofWarmbloods with MFM possessed a P variant and 29% of Warmbloods appear to have at least one P var- iant regardless of whether they have a muscle diseaseor not. 14Thus, there does not appear to be evidence to support that the P variants are themselves causa- tive or diagnostic of a muscle disease in the horse. 6. Management Management of PSSM2 and MFM requires both alter- ing diet and exercise regimes and is based largely on retrospective studies or clinical impressions rather than controlled diet trials.10More information needs to be collected from owners of horses who use themanagement approaches described below to deter- mine their ef cacy. Diet A low nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC), high-fat diet was previously recommended for PSSM2 based on the assumption that PSSM2 was a glycogen storage disor-der similar to PSSM1.10In Warmbloods, however, it is now clear there is not excessive glycogen storage inskeletal muscle based on biochemical analysis of gly-cogen concentrations. 1In addition, a survey of own- ers found that 80% of PSSM2 Warmbloods improved on the low NSC, high-fat diet; however, 53% of Warmbloods did not advance as expected in training,with reluctance to go forward and lack of collection persisting in approximately one-third of horses.10A revised diet was developed based on transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of muscle from horses withMFM and based on controlled diet trials in healthy Thoroughbreds.4,15,16The revised diet has not been evaluated in controlled diet trials of MFM horses,HOW-TO SESSION: MEDICAL REASONS FOR POOR PERFORMANCE 216 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGShowever. The diet was formulated based on indictors that aberrations in cysteine-based antioxidants, pro- tein degradation, oxidative stress, and the mitochon- drial respiratory chain are key signatures of MFM.4,15 MFM Diet A nutritionally balanced diet with appropriate caloric intake and adequate protein, vitamins, and minerals is essential, and the formulation may require the assis-tance of a nutritionist. The diet provided below is summarized from Pagan and Valberg.17Designing a diet requires determination of 1) daily nutrient require-ments, 2) the type and amount of forage, 3) the type of concentrate to supply additional energy, and 4) the need for supplements to supply additionally required nutrients not provided by forage and concentrate. Forage. MFM horses will typically consume 1.5 to 2% of body weight per day of hay. Good quality grass or grass-legume mixed hays (55-65% neutral deter- gentber [NDF], [CP], and 17% preferable.17 Concentrates. Recommended concentrates for PSSM2 and MFM Warmbloods are those with moder-ate levels of NSC (20-30%) and fat (4-8%) and higher levels of protein (12-14% CP) containing high-quality amino acids. Amino acids such as lysine, methionine, and threonine are important for eration of cysteine-based antioxidants. Leucine stim-ulates protein synthesis postexercise, 18 which would be bene cial to MFM horses. Supplements Amino acids. Whey-based proteins or supplements containing N-acetyl cysteine are recommended for horses with MFM because they are rich in cysteine. Cysteine is a key component of many antioxidants. MFM horses may have an increasedcysteine requirement based on alterations in genes involved in conversion of methionine to cysteine found in Arabian horses with MFM following exercise.15A supplement designed for MFM horsescthat contains N-acetyl cysteine and branched chain amino acids has recently become commercially available. Antioxidants. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a key component of the rst step in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and Warmblood horses with MFM have a decreased expression of proteins involved in the rst two steps in electron transport.4When fed to healthy horses, N-acetyl cysteine and coenzyme Q10dwere found to increase mitochondrial proteins.16CoQ10 is now being trialed as a supplement for MFM horses. Exercise Exercise Schedule An equally important part of the management of PSSM2 and MFM is an exercise regime. PSSM2 horses were previously recommended to exercise everyday; however, a recent survey of owners suggests that PSSM2 and MFM Warmbloods require days off train- ing during the week to recover.10,18The number of days per week to ride varies with each horse. Manyowners of PSSM2 and MFM horses have found that 3 days of work followed by 2 days off works best.aFor some horses, exercise more frequently than 3 days in arow or rest for more than 2 days in a row results in a stiff horse in the subsequent ride. Warm-Up A warm-up on the lunge-line in both directions in a long, low frame for 10 to 15 minutes is reported by owners to improve ridden work. During the warm- up, engagement of the hindquarters is not the aim, but rather, muscle relaxation, releasing at the base of the neck, and rounding and lifting of the back are desirable. Aids that help create a long, low frame on the lunge-line include Vienna reins, Pessoa lunging system \u00aee, or neck-stretchers. Initially, exercise is performed at a walk and trot. Strides at a canter can gradually be added looking for the horse to release at the base of the neck. When transitioning down to trot, the horse should begin to move forward with more impulsion. Riding A long and low warm-up at the trot and canter with adequate stretching is recommended before any col- lected work. Rest periods that allow the horse to relax and stretch their muscles between 2- to 5-mi- nute periods of collection under saddle may be of benet. Total ride times in horses with MFM appear to be most productive if kept between 30 and45 minutes, with horses just starting out having rides between 15 and 20 minutes (including walking).a Strengthening Exercises Hill work, cavaletti, and small jumps can be used to build strength. Aidsfand core strengthening exer- cises such as those found in Activating Your Horse 's Core c o u l da l s ob eb e n e cial.19 Turnout As much daily turnout as possible in an area where the horse is encouraged to move about is recommended.18 Professional Help Some Warmblood horses have strong, reactive tem-peraments and can develop behavioral issues such as refusing to go forward under saddle and bucking even after painful conditions have been resolved. In these cases, groundwork that reestablishes leadership and the help of a professional trainer experienced with dif- cult horses may be required to safely ensure \"for- ward\" means forward without protestation.

Introduction Poor performance in racehorses is a common com- plaint that equine practitioners are often asked toevaluate. The poor performance might be a docu-mented decline in performance, in which case clinicalproblems are plausible, or the poor performance mightinstead be a result of the horse never achieving ownerand trainer expectations wherein searches for medicalcauses may be elusive. The evaluation of a poorlyperforming racehorse should begin with a complete history, including race records if available, and a thor- ough clinical examination. Endoscopic (airways andstomach) and ultrasound (thorax) examinations areoften required. If the cause of the poor performancecannot be determined at this point, laboratory testingmay be the next diagnostic step, and both completeblood counts (CBCs) and serum chemistry panels arerecommended. The white blood cell count may pro-vide information suggestive of an in flammatory dis- ease, and the red blood cell evaluation provides anassessment of red cell volume and hemoglobin con-tent, although resting equine red cell values have awide normal range and do not re flect the values found during racing. Serum or plasma chemistry measure-ments should be a routine part of the poor perform-ance evaluation in racehorses unless the history andclinical exam have already revealed an answer for thepoor performance. The chemistry analytes that mostoften provide important diagnostic information in theevaluation of the poor performance horse carbondioxide (CO 2), (SDH) provide im-portant diagnostic information. The diagnostic valueof each analyte is discussed 2. Aspartate Aminotransferase and Kinase Abnormally high serum or plasma AST activity inracehorses is most often a result of muscle disease,although liver disease can also cause increased ASTactivity. If CK activity is also increased in the sam-ple, this strongly suggests that the AST increase is aresult of muscle injury. However, the absence of ele-vated serum CK activity in a horse with a high serumAST activity does not rule out muscle disease as acause for the high AST because the approximate half-lives of the 2 enzymes are very different (AST half-lifeis approximately 7-8 days, whereas CK is approxi-mately 2 hours). 1For example, if a horse worked on Monday and a transient muscle injuryoccurred, the initial increase in CK activity might NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 219HOW-TO SESSION: MEDICAL REASONS FOR POOR PERFORMANCEbe in a normal reference range by Wednesday, whereas AST activity would likely remain ele- vated for several days. Postexercise increases in serum CK and/or AST activity are most common in horses with recurrent exertional rhabdomyolysis (RER), a disease that affects approximately 5% to 7% of Standardbred and Thoroughbred racehorses.2,3 Female horses are at a signi cantly greater risk for RER than males. Although RER horses can havepersistently high serum AST activity, likely due to continuing subclinical episodes of rhabdomyolysis, this nding may not be predictive of per- formance.4A combination of clinical signs (stiffness, lameness, and poor recovery following exercise) sug- gestive of a muscle disorder along with markedly increased serum or plasma CK activity 4 to 6 hoursfollowing a race or moderate elevations in AST actively even several days later support RER as a cause of poor performance. The timing of blood col- lection following exercise for the measurement of se- rum muscle enzyme activity is important, as serum CK activity generally peaks at 4 to 6 hours and AST activity peaks at 12 to 24 hours following transientmuscle injury. 1Submaximal exercise tests that cause a 3-fold or greater increase in CK activity 4hours after exercise can help con rm RER, but this may not be predictive of clinical expression of RER atracing speeds. 4Regardless, elevations in CK and AST activity following exercise warrant considerationof changes in both diet and training/racing protocols inhopes of reducing further muscle injury. 5,6Mild increases in muscle-derived enzymes in the serum mayalso be caused by a lack of tness 3. Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase Another common serum biochemical abnormality detected in racehorses (both Thoroughbreds and Standardbreds) is an increase in serum or plasma GGT activity above normal reference ranges, some- t i m e sr e f e r r e dt ob yt r a i n e r sa n dv e t e r i n a r i a n sa st h e \"GGT syndrome\" . Although the serum GGT activity in horses with this syndrome is most commonly 2 to 5times above the maximal reference range, other he- patic-speci c enzymes such as SDH and GLDH and the c hepatic enzymes AST or lactate dehy- drogenase (LDH) are either within the normal refer-ence range or only mildly increased. The 2- to 5-fold increase in GGT activity often persists as long as the horse continues in full work. Studies have shown that mild-to moderate increases in GGT activity are associated with racing frequency and cumulativetraining load and that values return to normal when horses are removed from work. 7-9This has led to suggestions that the high GGT is caused by overtr-aining or maladaptation to training;7the author pre- f e r st h el a t t e rt e r m . T h ep r e v a l e n c eo ft h es y n d r o m eis not well documented and varies with the trainer. A recent prospective study involving threeThoroughbred stables with samples collected monthly for 5 months found the prevalence of horses that atsome time point had a GGT value of >50 IU/L was nearly 15%. 10In that study, GGT values were as high as 127 IU/L. When high GGT activity was ini-tially detected, the value of GGT was generally of sim-ilar or higher activity in the next monthlysample. In the author 's experience, Standardbred stables seem to have a higher prevalence of highGGTs than Thoroughbred stables. Although theincreased GGT activity in affected horses is certainlyabnormal, its association with poor racing perform-ance is not well documented, and some horses withmild-to moderate-increases in GGT activity will winraces. It has been suggested that GGT levelsapproaching 100 IU/L or greater are likely to be asso-ciated with a decline in performance. 11The associa- tion between high serum GGT activity and poorperformance is likely increased if the horse hasrecently experienced any of the following: decreasedweight in spite of continued normal appetite, anincrease in resting heart rate, and increased time needed to cool out following training. 7,8The etiology of the GGT syndrome is unproven, but a recent case-con- trolled study found evidence that supported both oxi-dative stress and cholestasis as being involved in thesyndrome. 10There are no controlled treatment stud- ies to allow speci c treatment recommendations, but based on a recent case-controlled study, treatments todecrease oxidative stress and improve bile flow might be reasonable. Although there is no statistical asso-ciation with the equine hepatitis viruses (equine par-vovirus-hepatitis [EqPV-H] hepacivirus[EqHV]) and the GGT syndrome, infection with eitherof these viruses should be considered as a cause forpoor performance when multiple hepatic enzymes(GGT, SDH, GLDH, and AST), and especially bileacids, are increased in serum or plasma. With eithervirus infection, hepatitis may occur at the time of bothpeak viremia and increasing antibody production, suggesting that the liver disease is caused by immune attempts to clear the viruses from the liver. 12,13 Chronic infection with either virus can occur, butchronic infection is unlikely to cause disease or beassociated with poor performance. Paired serumqPCR viral testing 4 weeks apart will help sort outrecent infection and chronic persistent infection. Adecline in viremia over 4 weeks suggests that theinfection is more acute and likely causative of theincreased liver enzymes. Horses with hepatitis fol-lowing recent infection with either virus could have adecline in performance and should not be heavilyworked until the serum GLDH activity has returnedto normal and the GGT is normal or approaching thenormal range. If hepatic disease is being monitoredby sending overnight samples to laboratories, moni-toring of GLDH activity is preferred over SDH, as thelatter is a less stable enzyme. When serum samplesfrom healthy racehorses are analyzed within a few hours of racing, it is common to nd mild elevations in SDH activity, and the clinical signi cance of this is unknown. LDH activity increases may occur with liver, skeletal muscle, or cardiac muscleHOW-TO SESSION: MEDICAL REASONS FOR POOR PERFORMANCE 220 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSdamage. Measurement of LDH activity is included in several commercial chemistry pro les, but the low tissue speci city and its short half-life limit its diag- nostic value. 4. Bilirubin Abnormally high concentrations of serum or plasma bilirubin in horses may be caused by hemolysis, decreased appetite, or liver dysfunction. It shouldalso be noted that a small percentage of healthyhorses will have indirect and total bilirubin values well above the normal reference range without any of the above known causes. The hyperbilirubinemia inthose horses may be as high as 11 mg/dl and isthought to be due to of hepatic uridine diphosphate-glucuronyl transferase. 14Af e the GGT syndrome will have mildly ele-vated bilirubin, but this is an inconsistent nding. 5. Serum Proteins High serum total proteins and globulins with concur- rent mild decreases in albumin concentration inhorses are strongly suggestive of a subacute-to-chronic inflammatory disease (e.g., lung abscess); localizing the site of in flammation can usually be accomplished by clinical exam and ancillary testing such as ultra-sound exam. Decreases in albumin and total protein generally indicate an intestinal disorder. 15When se- rum protein abnormalities are found on the chemistry panel, clinical signs such as weight loss and decreasedappetite are often noted along with the decline in rac- ing performance. Although not part of a routine bio- chemistry panel, serum amyloid A (SAA) is acommonly used stall-side test used to detect acute-to-subacute infl ammation in horses. Signi cant in- creases in SAA were not observed in healthy Thoroughbreds or Standardbreds following racing; 16if SAA is increased in a horse with poor performance, then an acute or subacute in flammatory disease should be suspected. SAA values might be normal if the disease process is chronic, and in one study, mea- surement of SAA was not helpful in the diagnosis ofmild asthma in racehorses.17 6. Bicarbonate, Total CO 2and Lactate Bicarbonate values on a chemistry provide anassessment of metabolic acid-base status. Some labo- ratories report total CO 2(TCO 2) concentration rather than bicarbonate concentration. TCO 2concentrations are generally 1 to 2 mEq/L higher than bi- carbonate. In racehorses, pre-race TCO 2is measured to monitor bicarbonate ( \"milkshakes \") administration, and pre-race values greater than 37 mEq/L (or mmol/l)suggest recent bicarbonate administration.18Drug administration or medical disorders that decrease se- rum chloride or albumin concentrations and increase strong ion differences may also raise bicarbonatevalues. Furosemide administration can cause a 1- to1.5-mEq/L increase in bicarbonate. 19Excessivesweating in horses causing a loss of chloride in excess of sodium can also cause an increase in bicarbonate and TCO 2. Increases in bicarbonate could play a physio- logic role in the development of synchronous diaphrag- matic flutter ( \"thumps\" ). Bicarbonate decreases most commonly occur secondary to increases in lactateproduction. When compared to well-performing race-horses, t racehorses with asthma, pulmonary hemor- rhage, and poor performance had lower bicarbonateand higher blood lactate concentrations 5 and15 minutes following a standardized treadmillstudy. 20L-lactate values were approximately 2-fold greater in the poor performing horses, with mean val- ues at 5 minutes postexercise of 10.5 to 12.2 mmol/L for the poor performance horses. Higher thanexpected lactate values are likely caused by cardiopul-monary disorders and increased anaerobic gly-colysis. Lactate testing using whole blood is pre-ferred over serum or plasma sample submission to alaboratory, and point-of-care tests are readily availablefor on-site measurements. valuesbetween poor- and well-performing racehorses, whichdiminishes its practical diagnostic value in evaluatingthe poor performance horse. Lactate testing might be better suited for controlled treadmill performance evaluations. 21Any organ system failure would likely cause poor performance in a racehorse, but in thosecases, the horses would likely demonstrate weight lossand decreased appetite. On rare occasion, a poor per-formance horse will have chronic renal failure anda serum creatinine in the 2.5- to 3.5-mg/dlrange. Horses with creatinine values above 3.5 mg/dlusually have weight loss and decreased appetite. 7. Sampling Conditions The following several factors must always be consid- ered when interpreting serum chemistry results: the timing of the sample, any unusual delay that mayhave occurred in submission or testing of the sample,and adverse storage conditions prior to testing (the so-called \"dashboard\" effect). For example, if blood for serum chemistry analysis is collected immediately af-ter a race, one would normally expect serum sodiumand total proteins to be slightly increased and bicar-bonate decreased due to loss of plasma water and increase in blood lactate, respectively. Low plasma glucose and high potassium concentrations are twocommon abnormalities that occur with improper orprolonged sample storage prior to testing. Also, con-sider that, on rare occasions, laboratory results couldbe erroneous due to laboratory error, so if the resultsdo not t the patient, be sure to retest. 8. Summary Determining the cause of poor performance in race- horses can be a diagnostic challenge. History and a complete clinical examination should always be theinitial diagnostic steps. Serum chemistry analysisHOW-TO SESSION: MEDICAL REASONS FOR POOR PERFORMANCE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 221should be part of the diagnostic workup when history and clinical examination do not reveal a cause. Themost common abnormalities noted on chemistry anal- ysis of poor performance horses are increased activity of muscle enzymes (CK and AST) and increased GGTactivity. The time of sample collection followingexercise should be considered when evaluating CKand AST values, whereas samples for GGT measure-ments can be taken at any time.

The issue of rider weight was highlighted as a priority forresearch at the 2nd International Saddle Research Trust Workshop.5 The following represents a synopsis of recent work that has investigated the potential effects of rider size on equine welfare and performance inhorses ridden in English saddles. It is not ex- haustive but provides some evidence-based infor- mation on which professional advice can be givenconcerning saddle t for horses and riders and t h es i z eo far i d e rr e l a t i v et oah o r s e . I nt h i sc o n -text, the term rider size is more pertinent thanrider weight because the suitability of a rider for a horse is in fluenced not only by their weight but also by their height and the morphology of the rider' s body. Moreover, rider size is potentially a less sensitive and emotive term, particularlywhen body mass index of the rider is not in itselfa problem. Studies investigating rider weight have been performed, 6-14but few have satisfacto- rily addressed this issue in a typical ridingsituation.11,13,14They have, for example, utilized lead weights to alter the total load carried by horses8-11,14\u2014which does not address the poten- tial differences in physique and balance in riders of differing weights or their position in the saddle \u2014and treadmill exercise,6which does not necessarily equate with overground exercise anddoes not include turns and circles. In addition,several of the previous studies have utilized veryhigh total load:horse bodyweight ratios, 8-12or been restricted to walk and trot,8-10and therefore this does not permit determination of whetherchanges in equine performance may occur atlower rider:horse bodyweight ratios, during allgaits and activities, or permit extrapolation to real-life situations. Therefore, although it is widely recognized that excessive rider size haswelfare implications for horses, 5there has been a lack of reliable scienti c evidence on which to base guidelines. This is a multifactorial issue with many interrelated aspects, including the horse 'sa g e ;i t s tness and muscle development; the length of the thoracolumbar region; the pres- absence of lameness or other musculoskel- etal problems; the type, speed, and duration of work; the rider' s skill, tness, balance, and NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 223HOW-TO SESSION: MEDICAL REASONS FOR POOR PERFORMANCEcoordination; the ability of the rider to sit straight; the t of the saddle to both the horse and rider; and the terrain over which the horse isridden. 5 2. The Effect of Rider Size and Ridden Horse Gait and Behavior Two recent studies in more typical riding situations reached somewhat con flicting results on what propor- tion of a horse' s bodyweight a horse can carry without potential welfare implications.13,14Study A (Dyson et al.), in which four experienced riders, of variable size but of similar ability, rode six horses in random order in a cross-over design, demonstrated that there were adverse effects on both gait and behavior for thetwo larger riders, 17% of the horses' body- weight.13Study B (Christensen et al.) showed no such effects when 20 horses were ridden by their usual riders, without and with additional lead weights strapped to the riders 't o r s o s ,u pt o2 3 %o ft h eh o r s e s ' bodyweight.14This is likely to re flect the differences in methodology employed: Study B14added dead weight, which is not the same as mimicking the real-world scenario of Study A,13when the distribution of the weight of a large rider (tall and/or heavy) wasmore dif cult to control. Moreover, the duration of riding was substantially different, 5 minutes in Study B14versus 30 minutes in Study A.13In addition, in Study B, there was a wide spectrum of baseline rider: Horse bodyweight percentages (including tack,15.3%60.4; range 12 -19%) and the average maxi- m u mw i t ha d d e dl e a dw e i g h t sw a s1 8 . 5 % 60.5 (range 15-23%).14Study A compared the same six horses ridden by four riders (without tack) of 10 -12% (L, light), > 12 15% (M, moderate), > 15 18% (H, heavy), and > 20% (VH, very heavy) of each of the horse 's bodyweight.13In both studies A13and B,14 there was no signi cant effect of rider size on heart rate variables or salivary cortisol concentra- tions. However, spontaneous blink rate, de ned as full occlusions of the left eye by the eyelid, recordedfor 15 minutes, was signi 0 3 ; t=0 ,df=5 ,p a i r e d ttest; Fig. 1) in Study A.15Spontaneous blink rate is an indica- tor of dopamine function, and an increase re flects a stress response. A Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram(RHpE) has been developed, comprising 24 behaviors,the majority of which are at least 10 times more likelyto be seen in a lame horse than a nonlame horse. 16An RHpE score of 8 of the 24 behaviors is likely to re flect the presence of musculoskeletal pain,16-20although some lame horses score <8. Reduction in the RHpE scores after abolition of lame-ness using diagnostic anesthesia proves a causal rela- tionship between these behaviors and musculoskeletalpain. 17The RHpE scores can also be in fluenced by rider weight distribution and saddle t for the horse (speci cally tight tree points of the saddle).21In Study A,13there was a signi cant difference in RHpE scores according to riders (Fig. 2; analysis of variance[ANOVA], Bonferroni: M to H, p<0.01; L and M to VH,p<0.001; H to VH, p<0.05) and a linear positive correlation between rider weight and the RHpE score (R=0 . 4 F= 1 7 . 2 7 ;F i g .4 )a n df a c i a l expression (ANOVA, p<0.001, F= 18.72; Fig. 5) sig- nicantly increased with the H and VH riders, Fig. 1.

The zero line represents pre-exercise SBR. All H and VH tests were abandoned prematurely after a mean of 16.6 and 8.3 minutes, respectively, compared with the full test length of 30 minutes. There was a signi cant elevation in post-exercise SBR for rider H (p = 0.03; t=0 ,df= 5, paired ttest). Fig. 2.

Values sharing superscripts are not signi cantly different.

However, the total RHpE scores were less than 8 for the majority of tests. There were prede ned criteria for test aban- donment: 1. Development of lameness grade 3/823in one limb or grade 2/8 in 2 limbs; 2. Exacerbation of pre-existing grade-1 lameness by 2g r a d e s( / 8 ) ; and 3. An RHpE score 10/24.13One test for the heavy rider was halted prematurely because of the dis-play of a total of 10 behaviors of the RHpE by the con- clusion of the rst canter and all the other tests of the heavy rider, and all tests for the very heavy rider wereabandoned prematurely because of the development of transient forelimb or hindlimb lameness. In Study B, a narrower range of behaviors was assessed, which were less speci cally de ned.14No effect of rider weight on behavior was seen, but the large variationin the frequency of so-called \"conflict behaviors\" (e.g., mouth open, tail swishing, head tossing) among thehorses before addition of extra weight and the high fre-quency of tail swishing may have concealed any effectof rider weight. In a third study, there were effects ofadditional weight on gait, although overt lamenesswas not horses carried 35% of their own bodyweight (asingle professional rider plus lead) at the t\u00f6lt on a 321-m oval track. Kinematics were measured using ahigh-speed camera in an incremental exercise test (5/C2642 m). Although there were no measurable changes in regularity of rhythm or symmetry, increas- ing weight was associated with decreased stridelength, increased stride frequency, and increased dutyfactor (the proportion of the stride time during which alimb is in the stance phase) in all limbs, factors thatwere not assessed in the previous studies. Force isthe product of mass and acceleration, so any effect ofadded weight is likely to be greater at faster than atslower speeds. These observations emphasize theneed to consider the expected stride and gait charac-teristics for the type of horse that is being ridden. 3. Rider Size and Weight Distribution Rider size, both height (also in fluenced by limb length versus trunk length) and seat size, and the design, t, and balance of a saddle determine how a rider sits ina saddle. For optimal weight and force distribution,t h er i d e rs h o u l ds i ti nt h em i d d l eo fas a d d l et oe n a b l ethem to be in balance with the horse and as close as Fig. 3.

In a pilot study, the seat of the rider was too large for the saddle in 41% of 34 horse-rider combinations.24In a more recent study,25the seat of the rider was too large for the saddle in 40% of 193 horse-rider combinations, a n d5 1 %o fr i d e r ss a to nt h eb a c kr a t h e rt h a ni nt h e middle of the saddle. This may have been becausethe saddle was too small relative either to the rider 's leg length or to the size of their seat. Alternatively,it could have been the result of the saddle being thewrong shape for the rider, the stirrup bars being in aninappropriate position, or the rider being in an inher-ently poor position. In Study A, the heavy and veryheavy riders sat on the caudal third of the saddle (Figs. 6, 7). 13This was in part related to the tall height and long leg length of the heavy rider. It is notable that the usual rider of Horse 2 was of similarweight (91 kg) to the heavy rider (92 kg) but was con-siderably shorter. When ridden by the usual rider,w h os a ti nt h em i d d l eo ft h es a d d l e ,t h eh o r s ep e r -formed completely normally; when ridden by the tallrider (H), who sat on the back of the same saddle, thehorse showed transient lameness and the RHpE scoreincreased. It was objectively demonstrated in Study A that the larger riders (H and VH) who sat on theback of the saddle increased forces transmitted through the caudal half of the saddle. 26Pressures were signi cantly higher under the caudal aspect of the saddle compared with cranially for rider VH inwalk ( p<0.05, ANOVA, Bonferroni). At rising, trot pressures were cranially for riders L, M, and H(p<0.05, ANOVA, Bonferroni) but were similar crani- ally and caudally for rider VH. The highest maxi-mum peak pressure was recorded for rider VH incanter. For the longitudinal (craniocaudal) center ofpressure (COP), rider VH had a median COP signi - cantly more toward the caudal aspect of saddlecompared with other riders ( ANOVA). Alteration in the distributionof pressure has the potential to adversely affect thora-columbar movement and hindlimb gait. In a small study that compared a standard- t t i n gs a d d l et oo n e with panels that were 10 cm shorter, there was increased pressure under the middle and caudalthirds of the saddle panels and caudal displacement ofthe COP with the shorter saddle. 27This was associ- ated with reduced range of motion in the caudal tho-racic and lumbar regions and reduced hindlimbprotraction. These effects could be potentially com-pounded if other saddle- tting problems were also present. In a study of 191 horse and rider combina-tions, 49% of riders were observed to be out of balance;19% of saddle seats tipped backwards, and many ofthe saddles moved excessively during ridden exercise( d o r s o v e n t r a l4 7 % ,s i d et os i d e4 8 % ,s a d d l es l i p45%). 25In a related study comprising a subset of 148 of the horses, there was a signi cant positive association between RHpE scores for horses ridden byriders who sat on the caudal third of the saddle com-pared with those in the middle of the saddle. 21 4. Rider Size, Epaxial Muscle Tonicity and Pain, and Thoracic Dimensions In Study A, the thoracolumbar region was palpated systematically before and after each ridden test, and t h ep r e s e n c ea n dl o c a t i o no fe p a x i a lm u s c l eh y p e r t o -nicity or pain were recorded.28Increased muscle ten- sion was de n e da sm u s c l es t i f f n e s sw i t hl i t t l eo rn o Fig. 6.

Pain was characterized by the horse moving away from the pressure or dgeting, laying the ears back, swishing the tail, kicking, biting, reac- tive contraction of the muscle, or extending the thora- columbosacral region. Overall muscle hypertonicityscores (present/not present) for all horses increased signicantly for riders M and H after ridden exercise (p<0.05), and for rider VH, there was a trend for increased pain scores ( p= 0.08), despite early termina- tion of all tests for the heavy and very heavy riders. The thoracic dimensions were documentedbefore and immediately after each ridden exercise test at the 8th, 13th, and 18th thoracic vertebrae using a flexible curve ruler. 28For each level, the thoracic widths were measured at 5 cm and 15 cm ventral tothe dorsal midline, as previously described.29It has previously been demonstrated that there are measura-ble increases in thoracic dimensions after a 30minutes 'work period, assuming that the horse is working correctly, in a well- tting saddle. 30In Study A, there were signi cant reductions ( p=0 . 0 2 ) i n t h o - racic dimensions during a 30 minutes 'work period for the heavy and very heavy riders (H /C03.4% and VH /C02.8%, respectively; Fig. 8), whereas for the lighter riders, there were increases in thoracic dimensions (L 3.9% and M 1.9%, respectively).28The changes were largest at 5 cm ventral to the dorsal midline at the 8th and 13th thoracic vertebrae. The reductions were greater for the heavy rider than the very heavy rider, presumably related to the duration of riding. Testsfor the very heavy rider were terminated earlier (mean test duration of 8.3 minutes, range 9 - 25 minutes) than for the heavy rider (mean test dura- tion of 16.6 minutes, range 6 -19 minutes). The reductions in thoracic dimensions could have deleteri-ous consequences for long-term epaxial muscledevelopment and function and may result in atrophy of longissimus dorsi in the thoracolumbar region. 29,30 These factors could be compounded if the rider sat crookedly,31-33was not in synchrony with the horse 's movement,34or if the saddle did not t the horse ideally, which is a common nding.25,32,35Ill-tting saddles were identi ed in 78% of 193 sports and lei- sure horses in the United Kingdom, with tight treepoints (67%) being the most common problem.25In a previous United Kingdom study, ill- tting saddles were identi ed in 43% of 205 sports and leisure horses.32In Switzerland, 74% of 237 sports and lei- sure horses had ill- tting saddles.35 5. The Fit of the Saddle to Both the Rider and the Horse It is generally accepted that the tree of the saddle should not extend beyond the 18th thoracic vertebra (T18), or last rib, although the ability of saddle tters to identify these landmarks reliably was limited,36 and agreement among saddle tters about appropri- ateness of saddle length was poor.37The scienti c b a s i sf o rt h ep r i n c i p l eo ft h et r e en o te x t e n d i n gb e y o n dT18 is limited, and the Society of Master Saddlers hasadvised that the panels of the saddle can extend totherst lumbar vertebra. 38However, if the rider 's weight is centered caudal to the 13th thoracic verte-bra, the rider will be positioned behind the horse 's center of gravity, which potentially in fluences the rider 's ability to be in balance with the horse.39There is a signi cant body of evidence that demonstrates that if a rider is sitting on the back ofthe saddle, rather than in the middle, this is poten-tially detrimental to the horse. With some riders, it m a yb ep o s s i b l et oa l t e rt h er i d e r 'sp o s i t i o nb yu s i n ga saddle that is better suited to their size and that also ts the horse. The seat of the saddle and the panels can be lengthened without increasing the length ofthe tree. 39The position of the bars of the saddle, from which the stirrup leathers and stirrups are sus- pended, can be altered. The shape, position, and sizeof both the saddle flaps and the knee blocks can be adjusted. However, with some horse-rider combina- tions, it may be impossible to have a saddle that ts both the horse and the rider optimally (Figs. 9A, B). 6. Overall Considerations: How to Assess Rider Suitability for a Horse There is suf c i e n te v i d e n c et oi n d i c a t et h a tar i d e r who is too large for a horse has the potential to have an adverse effect on the horse 'sg a i t ,p e r f o r m a n c e , muscle development, and long-term musculoskeletalhealth. However, rider size cannot be considered inisolation. There are many other factors to consider \u2014 for example, the skill, core strength, balance, and t- ness of the rider; the physical well-being of the horse,itstness and musculoskeletal strength, and its coor- dination; the duration and intensity of work; and theterrain and footing. Although it has been suggested Fig. 8.

Increasing horsebody weight to reduce the ratio is not an appropriate solution. There are, however, some broad guidelines to consider with respect to rider size based on the scien-tic data presented. The horse 's thoracolumbar length must be able to accommodate a saddle that allows therider to sit in the center of the saddle, with their shoulder, \"hip,\"and heel in vertical alignment, and to ride in balance with the horse. 39An equine veterinar- i a ns h o u l db ea b l et oe v a l u a t et h o r a c o l u m b o s a c r a le p a x - ial muscle development, tonicity, and pain, both beforeand after ridden exercise; to assess static and dynamicsaddle t for the horse and rider; to understand the ba- sic concepts of correct rider position, straightness, andbalance; to observe and understand the behavior ofhorses during tacking-up, mounting, and ridden exer-cise; to pay particular attention to head and neck posi-tion and facial expressions; and to recognize alterations in gait in trot and canter, including shortening of the stride. Comparison of the horse' sb e h a v i o ra n dt h e quality of the movement (step length, limb flight, sus- pension, rhythm, speed 6lameness) in trot and canter on the lunge without the rider and when ridden (Fig. 9, A and B) may be valuable. During ridden exercise, the horse should be viewed from the side, behind, andin front to assess not only the horse 's movement but also any side-to-side oscillation of the saddle, dorsoven-tral movement of the back of the saddle ( \"bouncing \"), or saddle slip to one side and whether the rider iscrooked. 33,39It may be helpful to acquire video record- ings so that the observations can be discussed with therider, together with the implications of those ndings with respect to the long-term musculoskeletal health of the horse. When discussing the biomechanical impli- cations of an oversized rider, it should be borne in mind that at walk, the maximum forces transmitted through the panels of the saddle are continuous, whereas at trot they are biphasic. In the three-beat canter, not only are peak forces higher because force is the product of mass and acceleration, but they are also asymmetrical, reflecting the movement of the thoracolumbar region. If the horse is used for jumping, it should bepointed out that the forces under the front of the saddle at landing are considerably greater than those experi- enced at walk, trot, and canter. Use of a force mat toquantify the distribution, magnitude, and symmetry of forces under the saddle provides some limited objective information. 26,33There is a positive association between rider weight and magnitude of force, although it is nota linear relationship.26,41However, it must be borne in mind that what looks wrong probably is wrong (Fig. 9,A and B), and the potential consequences need careful discussion with the rider. Knowledge of the scienti c evidence supporting the potentially adverse effectsof a rider who is too big for a horse provides a founda- tion on which to base discussions with an ow- ner. Involvement of an experienced human physio- therapist, as an independent expert who is able to a s s e s sr i d e rs t a t i ca n dd y n a m i cs y m m e t r y ,b a l a n c e , and coordination, is sometimes also helpful. 7. Conclusions Veterinarians, riders, and trainers should be more aware of the potentially deleterious effects of a rider who is too large for a horse, with respect to gait, thora- columbar muscle function, and development, and the Fig. 9. A, A 4-year-old potential event horse. The large rider is sitting on the caudal third of the saddle. The rider 's shoulder, \"hip,\"and heel are not in alignment. The horse has a head tilt, the right eyelids are partially closed, and the bit is pulled through to the right. The length of the horse 's back would prohibit the use of a larger saddle. B, A large rider on a pony. The pony 's neck is bent to the left although the pony is trotting in a straight line. The right eye has an intense stare. The right ear is back. The pony 's front feet are kicking up the arena surface, despite excellent footing, re flecting compromised movement. Moreover, the rider is not sitting straight; her left foot is lower than her right, and her shoulders are asymmetrical.HOW-TO SESSION: MEDICAL REASONS FOR POOR PERFORMANCE 228 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSpotential risk of musculoskeletal injury. They should also recognize that behavioral abnormalities that are often considered as \"normal horse behavior \" may re flect musculoskeletal pain. Observation of a horse 's behavior during tacking-up and mounting42 and during ridden exercise may be key indicators thatthe horse is uncomfortable during ridden exercise.25,42 Comparison of spontaneous blink rate before and af-ter exercise may also be helpful because an increasedrate after exercise is an indicator of stress. There is no doubt that for some horse and rider combinations, it may be impossible to nd a saddle that is suitable for both the horse and the rider, and in these cases,this means that the rider is likely to compromise the horse 's long-term welfare if they continue to ride. There is a moral responsibility for the equine veterinary profession to advise such riders that theyare too large for the horse, however dif cult that dis- c u s s i o nm a yb e ;t of a i lt od os ow o u l dj e o p a r d i z et h e horse 's short-term and long-term welfare.

Introduction In the absence of environmental stimuli, the majority of healthy, stabled horses, managed under good wel-fare conditions, normally exhibit relaxed, quiet, and passive postures and behaviors.1These normal behaviors should be maintained during tacking-up and mounting, with no agitation, anxiety, or nonphy- siological postures or movements. However, some horses display a wide range of abnormal behaviorsand postures when tacked-up or mounted that deviate from their normal patterns of behavior. These include, for example, threatening behaviors, dg- eting, and odd postures; indeed, the term \"cold- backed \"behavior is often used to describe extreme abnormal behavior when a horse is tacked-up ormounted. 2Understanding the reasons for abnor- mal behavior during tacking-up and/or mountingand managing the horses accordingly may help tooptimize horse welfare and ultimately improve athletic performance. Suggested reasons for abnormal behavior during tacking-up include ill-tting tack, girth region hypersensitivity, or anticipation of musculoskeletal pain when rid- den. 3-6Previous studies have identi ed that a large percentage of horses have ill- tting tack7-9and that a large proportion of sports horses consideredn o n l a m eb yt h e i ro w n e r sa r el a m eo rh a v eo t h e rp a i n -related gait abnormalities. 9-14Although many horses with gastric ulceration do not show girth aver- sion behavior,15an association between ( \"girthy \"behavior, was observed in a small number of horses.6Some riders of horses with extreme cold- backed behavior or those that buck immediately aftermounting 2may seek veterinary advice. However, it has been observed that more subtle abnormal behav-iors during tacking-up or mounting are largelyignored by riders or are not recognized as abnormal. Additionally, there is a failure of riders to see these abnormal behaviors, or the rider becomeshabituated to them. Riders sometimes reportgrumpy behavior when their horse is tacked-up but NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 231HOW-TO SESSION: MEDICAL REASONS FOR POOR PERFORMANCEsay that this behavior is usual for their horse, assum- ing that it is a normal equine character- istic. However, it has previously been observed in a limited number of horses that had shown markedly abnormal behavior when tacked-up that when under- lying musculoskeletal pain was successfully managed long term by addressing all problems, behavior during tacking-up improved dramatically.16Improvement in a horse 's demeanor after successful treatment of musculoskeletal pain has anecdotally been noticed byriders, despite their previous failure to notice the pres- ence of abnormal behavior. aThe objectives of this paper are to review recent studies that provide evi-dence-based information concerning tacking-up and mounting behavior, to highlight the reasons why it is important to assess this behavior, and to provide guid- ance about how to assess such behavior. 2. How Is Abnormal Behavior During Tacking-Up and Mounting Defined? In order to de ne what may represent abnormal behavior during tacking-up and mounting, a large- scale observational study was performed on horses at rest and during tacking-up and mounting.16Ap u r - pose-designed protocol for documenting facial expres-sions and behavior during each phase of tacking-up (approaching the horse, putting on the bridle, placingthe saddle, doing up the girth) and mounting and moving forward after mounting was developed. This was adapted from previous publications relating to tack, 5,6,17- 19the facial expressions of the ridden horse ethogram,20the Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram (RHpE),21and observations of horses 'behavior, including posture and movement. In the nal proto- col, a total of 64 behaviors for tacking-up and a totalof 30 behaviors for mounting and moving off were documented. Additional observations were docu-mented freehand. The study horses ( n=1 9 3 ) r e p r e - sented a convenience sample of sports and leisurehorses, ranging from equine college horses to elite competition horses, ridden by amateurs or professionals. 16The horses were in full work andassumed by their riders to be working comfortably. To establish the normal behavior base-line patterns for individual horses at rest, the horses were observed undisturbed for approximately 8 minutes during acquisition of prede ned information from the riders. The riders were then asked to tack- up and mount as they would normally do. Abnormal behavior, de ned as changes that deviated from an individual horse 's normal baseline behaviors, were then recorded during bridling, placement of the sad- dle, girthing, and mounting. The majority of horses (67%) were bridled rst. The median sum of abnor- mal behaviors during tacking-up was 10/64 (inter- quartile range 7 -13, range 0-33). There was an equal frequency of abnormal behaviors during bri- dling and saddling in 52% of horses, 34% of more abnormal behaviors during saddling than bridling, and 15% of horses showed more abnor- mal behaviors during bridling than saddling. Theduration of abnormal behaviors related to total tack- ing-up time was 25% to 75% in 51% of horses. There was a positive relationship between the sum of abnor-mal behaviors and the duration of abnormal behav-iors ( p= 0.0001). Repeatedly chomping on the bit occurred frequently during bridling (67%).Ears and C; 54-62%) were similar in all phases. Fidgeting was more common during saddle placement (32%) andgirthing (21%) ment (20%) than bridling (10%). Turning the head to the girth (Figs. 2B; 5D) was only seen during saddleplacement and girthing (11% and 40%, respectively), in addition to attempting to bite (5% and 15%, respec- tively) and rubbing the nose (Fig 2A; 8% and 21%,respectively). The median sum of abnormal behav-iors during mounting was 1/30 (interquartile range 1- 3, range 0-12; Figs. 6-8). The majority of riders (90%) mounted from a mounting block; 17% of horseswere reluctant to approach the block or moved away from it before mounting. The most frequent abnor- mal behaviors observed during or immediately after Fig. 1. A, The reins and a neck strap have been passed over the horse 's neck. The horse is yawning. B, The rider is about to put the rest of the bridle on. The right ear is back. The right eye has an intense stare. The lips are separated, exposing the teeth. C, The horse has raised and twisted its head and neck as the headpiece is being placed behind the horse 's ears. The sclera is visible in the right eye, which has an intense stare. The mouth is open widely with the tongue hanging out.HOW-TO SESSION: MEDICAL REASONS FOR POOR PERFORMANCE 232 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSmounting included dgeting (26%; Figs. 6 and 7), tail swishing (17%), chomping on the bit (17%), extension of the thoracolumbar region (14%; Fig. 8), yankingdown on the reins (12%), and tossing the head(11%). The most common behavior observed whenmoving forward after mounting was the horseshowing reduced range of motion of the thoraco-lumbar region (12%). Many of the behaviors observed during tacking-up were typical of those previously attributed to stereotypical behavior(for example, head tossing, tongue out, nose rub-bing, licking), which is frequently stress associ-ated. 22-26Biting and kicking have been considered as aggressive behaviors.27Some be-haviors may be ar eflection of pain (for example, ears back, intense stare, tail swishing).21,28 -31 3. Do Horse Riders Recognize Signs of Abnormal Behavior During Tacking-Up and Mounting? In order to determine whether riders recognize signs of abnormal behavior during tacking-up and mount- i n g ,p r i o rt ot a c k i n g - u p ,t h er i d e r sw e r ea s k e di ft h e y recalled whether their horse showed abnormal behav-ior when tacked-up or mounted (yes/no).32They were subsequently asked if their horse showed speci c behaviors (yes/no) during approach to the horse bridling ( n=1 3 ) n g ( n=2 2 ) , girthing (n = 21), mounting ( n=1 9 ) ,a n dm o v i n go f fa f - ter mounting ( n= 13). Each horse was observed dur- ing tacking-up and mounting by one veterinarian who recorded the occurrence of each behavior. Agreement between the riders and the veterinarian was evaluated using intraclass correlation (ICC) coef cients with 95% con dence intervals (CI). ICC values less than 0.40 are indicative of poor agreement, values between0.40 and 0.59 indicate fair agreement, values between0.60 and 0.74 indicate good agreement, and values0.75 indicate excellent agreement. 33The 95% CIs should be included in the interpretation of cutoffs forqualitative rating of agreement. 34Overall, 34.2% (66/193) of riders reported that their horse showed be- havioral abnormalities during tacking-up or mount- ing,32whereas abnormal behavior was observed by the veterinarian for 25% of the total tacking-up time in 66% of horses.16For attempts to bite, there was fair to excellent agreement during saddling (ICC 0.67, CI0.56-0.75) and good to excellent agreement during girthing (ICC 0.73, CI 0.64-0.79). There was poor to good agreement between the riders and veterinarianfor horses putting their head up to avoid bridling (ICC0.53, CI 0.37-0.64) and being reluctant to open their mouth for the bit (ICC 0.52, CI 0.36-0.64). There was Fig. 2. A, The horse is rubbing its nose on the stable door after placement of the saddle. B, The horse is turning its head and neck toward the girth. C, The horse 's ears are back, there is an intense stare in the right eye, and the sclera is visible. The horse was tossing its head. The left hindlimb has been picked up. Fig. 3.

Results for some behaviors suggestedpotential systematic disagreement between the veteri-narian and riders. The majority of riders wereunaware that their horses showed behavioral abnor-malities during tacking-up or mounting. The notableexceptions were attempting to bite during saddle placement or girthing and kicking at the abdomen during saddle placement. This recognition may bebecause such behaviors can be classed asdangerous. There were common abnormal behav-iors, which were either interpreted as normal or notrecognized by riders, including chomping on the bit,ears back, and an intense stare during bridling, sad-dling, and tail mounting; head tossing girthing; yankingdown on the reins immediately after mounting; andspontaneously walking forward before a cue from therider Figs. 6B; 7). These data highlight the impor-tance of not relying on owner recall when acquiringthe history of a horse; personal assessment by the vet- erinarian is essential.4. What Do These Behaviors Mean? The behavioral abnormalities during tacking-up or mounting were related to the presence of epaxial mus- cle hypertonicity or pain, girth region hypersensitiv-ity, ill- tting tack, rider position and balance, or equine musculoskeletal pain manifest as lameness inhand or when ridden or gait abnormalities incanter. 35Lameness was graded on a 0-8 scale.36 The RHpE21was applied retrospectively to video recordings of the horses acquired during riddenexercise. Multivariable negative binomial regressionmodeling was used to assess the relationship betweenthe sum of tacking-up and mounting behaviors and horse, rider, and tack- t variables. Equine college horses comprised only 12% of the sample population but had higher rates of abnormal behaviors duringboth tacking-up ( p<0.0001) and mounting (p =0 . 0 0 7 ) compared with general purpose horses. The rate ofabnormal behaviors during tacking-up for horses withmoderate lameness (de ned as lameness grade 3<grade 5/8, or RHpE score 8 behaviors and lame- nessgrade 2/8, to include symmetrical gait abnor- mality, e.g., lack of hindlimb impulsion) or severelameness (de ned as grade 5/8) was 1.4 times higher ( p= 0.02) than for nonlame horses.

Tight tree points of the saddle(p= 0.03) and epaxial muscle pain ( p<0.001) were associated with higher abnormal behavior scores dur-ing tacking-up. Higher static saddle- ts c o r e sw e r e associated with higher abnormal behavior scores dur-ing mounting. The signi cant relationship between epaxial muscle pain, lameness, and tight tree pointsand the behavior scores of horses observed duringtacking-up suggest that such behaviors are in antici-pation of pain, either caused directly by the tack orreflecting musculoskeletal pain during ridden exercise.5. Why, When, and How Should Behavior During Tacking-Up and Mounting Be Observed? These observations indicate that the display of abnor- mal behaviors during tacking-up and mounting is likely to be of potential clinical signi cance. Therefore, when assessing a horse as part of a prepurchase exam- ination, as a routine maintenance assessment, or when performing an investigation of poor perform-ance, it is important to include an evaluation of thehorse 's behavior initially at rest and then during tack- ing-up and mounting. This should be combined withsystematic palpation of the thoracolumbosacral andg i r t hr e g i o n s ,a no r a le x a m i n a t i o n ,e v a l u a t i o no ft h et of the bridle, and assessment of static and dynamic saddle t for both the horse and the rider, 37-41to include the saddle pad(s), numnah(s), and girth.Many horses show a transient increase in the fre- quency of partial eyelid closure, blinking, eye closure, and putting the ears back as the headpiece of the bri-d l ei sp l a c e db e h i n dt h ee a r s . 16Many horses transi- ently mouth the bit several times immediately after the bridle is put on. These behaviors are not consid- ered to be abnormal. The horse should be observedfor several minutes prior to tacking-up in order to appreciate its normal posture and behavior. Events occur rapidly during tacking-up and mounting and asthe horse moves forward after mounting, so focusedattention is required. The use of a checklist (Table 1), which the examiner has become familiar with in advance, is re-commended. This includes assessmentof the horse 's reaction to the approach of the rider with the tack, evaluation of facial expressions (Figs. 1A-C;2C; 8A and B), limb (Fig 2C) and tail movements, and whether the horse stands still or moves repeatedly. To put the ndings into context, it is also necessary to consider the skill ofthe rider 's handling of the horse, the suitability of their size for the horse (Fig 7), and the methodthat is used to mount the horse (from the ground,via a leg-up, or using a mounting block; Figs. 6- 8). As with any clinical skill, the ability of an ex- aminer to recognize all the behaviors exhibited is Fig. 6. A, The horse has its ears back behind a vertical position and has an intense stare of the right eye as the rider prepares tomount. The rider has grasped the front and back of the saddle with her left and right hands, respectively. B, The horse is moving forward before the rider has succeeded in mounting, the ears are back behind a vertical position, and there is an intense stare of the right eye. The lips and teeth are separated, expos-ing the tongue. Note that the saddle is being pulled by the rider to the left. Fig. 7. The horse had to be held to be mounted but, despitethis, is walking away from the mounting block before the rider has completed mounting. The head is raised and tilted, and themouth is wide open. The ears are behind a vertical position. The rider looks big for the horse, but in contrast to Fig 6, his left arm is on the horse 's neck and his right hand is on the right of the saddle, and the assistant is pulling down on theright stirrup so that the saddle is not moving unduly. Fig. 8. A, Mounting is complete, but the horse has raised its head, and the thoracolumbosacral region is extended. The ears are back behind a vertical position, and there is an intense starein the left eye. B, The horse is rather reluctant to move forward and swishes its tail, and the thoracolumbosacral region remains extended, with the head and neck elevated.HOW-TO SESSION: MEDICAL REASONS FOR POOR PERFORMANCE AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 235Table 1.

It is also clear that riders need education about the recognition of abnormal behaviors during tacking-up andmounting because such behaviors are likely to re flect an underlying problem with tack t, musculoskeletal pain, or other pain (for example, gastric ul-ceration). However, it is acknowledged that a smallproportion of the observations, such as reluctance toopen the mouth to accept the bit or walking forward af-ter mounting before a cue from the rider, may re flect inadequate or inappropriate training. 6. If Abnormal Behavior Is Observed During Tacking- Up or Mounting, What Should Be Done Next? It is beyond the scope of this paper to provide a comprehensive review of how to investigate further. However, key areas for assessmentinclude the t of the bridle, saddle, girth, pads, and additional equipment such as breastplatesand martingales. 37-41T h es a d d l em u s t tb o t h the horse and the rider, enabling the rider to be inoptimal balance with the horse. A comprehen-sive evaluation of the oral cavity and the musculo-skeletal system should be carried out, withparticular attention paid to the presence of girthregion sensitivity, epaxial muscle hypertonicity,or pain. The horse should be observed during ridden exercise to evaluate any signs of lameness or modi cations of canter. Gastroscopy should be considered, 6,15bearing in mind that gastric ulceration may develop secondary to chronic mus-culoskeletal pain. The skill of the rider 'sh a n - dling techniques and the method of mountingshould be assessed; some modi cations may be required. Detailed reviews of approaches tohorses performing poorly when ridden 42,43or exhibiting cold-backed behavior or bucking2are available elsewhere. Following the identi cation of the primary cause(s) of underlying problems,an appropriate management strategy can bedeveloped, which may require a team approachinvolving, for example, a quali ed saddle tter and a physiotherapist or chiropractor. Reexaminationshould involve further assessment of behavior to mon-itor progress and the ef cacy of rehabilitation. As some behaviors can be learned \u2014for example, failure to stand still while being mounted \u2014retraining may also be required. 7. Conclusions Assessment of behavior during tacking-up and mounting is considered to be an essential part of the diagnostic armamentarium for an equine veterinar- ian in order to optimize both equine welfare and per- formance. There is an association between the num-ber of behaviors exhibited during tacking-up andmounting and the presence of lameness and/or abnor-mal saddle t. Education of clients is also ofTable 1.

Introduction A majority of equine uterine problems can be diag- nosed using assessment of reproductive history anddiagnostic techniques such as transrectal ultrasonog-raphy, vaginal the uterus, or hyster- oscopy, can also be a valuable procedure to detect orconrm suspected uterine abnormalities, to obtain uterine samples for subsequent analysis, to be used asa therapeutic delivery modality, or to deposit semenat the uterotubular junction. Hysteroscopy is mostvaluable in the detection pathologic abnormalitieswithin the uterine lumen or endometrial surface thatcannot be diagnosed by traditional diagnostic tech-niques. Abnormalities may include intrauterineadhesions, retained endometrial cups, localized lesions,and focal sites of infection. Pioneer studies on the useof hysteroscopy in the mare began in the late 1960sand continued through the early 1990s. 4-8Several recent reviews have described the endoscopy equip-ment, mare preparation, and general procedures forhysteroscopy.9-11In general, a videoendoscope or gas- troscope with a working length of 1 to 1.5 meters, anexternal diameter of 9.8 to 12.8 mm, and a biopsy chan-nel size of 2.8 to 3.8 mm is recommended. The endo-s c o p es h o u l db ec o l ds t e r i l i z e dw i t h2 . 4 %g l u -taraldehyde and subsequently rinsed with 0.9% sterilesaline prior to use. The mare should be restrained inexamination stocks and sedated (i.e., with a combina-tion of detomidine hydrochloride and butorphanol tar-trate), and a thorough cleansing of the perineum shouldbe performed prior to the procedure. Insuf flation of the uterine lumen is required for optimal visualizationduring the examination. The goal of this review is todescribe how hysteroscopy can be utilized in equinepractice as an adjunct diagnostic or therapeuticmodality. 2. Detection of Intrauterine Adhesions Adhesions across the lumen of the uterus areuncommon and occur secondary to dystocia orobstetrical procedures used to resolve a dysto-cia. 12-15Intrauterine adhesions are dif cult to NOTES 240 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSCLINICAL PERSPECTIVES ON MANAGING EQUINE UTERINE HEALTHdiagnose on transrectal ultrasound but may become visible if fluid (i.e., sterile saline or lactated Ringer 's solution) is infused into the lumen to distend the uterus.

Detection of Uterine Trauma Trauma to the uterus can occur during an apparently normal foaling, during a dystocia with or without obstetrical manipulations, or as a consequence of a surgical procedure such as a cesarean or ovariec- tomy.16-18Diagnosis of uterine trauma may be based on reproductive history, clinical signs, trans-rectal and/or transabdominal ultrasonography,laparoscopy, abdominocentesis, manual evaluation of the uterine lumen, and videoendoscopic evaluation ofthe uterine lumen (Figs. 2 and 3). Obtaining anaccurate diagnosis is key to formulation of a therapeu-tic plan and prognosis for recovery and futurefertility. 4. Detection, Evaluation, and Removal of a Uterine Mass Primary uterine tumors are rare in the horse and would include leiomyomas, leiomyosarcomas, lymphosarcomas, adenocarcinoma, and other Fig. 1.

Videoendoscopy can be used to visual- ize intralumenal and intramural masses, obtainsmall biopsies, facilitate accurate location for collection of a larger biopsy sample, or facilitate removal of pedunculated masses (Fig. 4). 8,19- 26 5. Detection of Focal Areas of Infection or Inflammation A general presumption is that a uterine infection is evenly distributed throughout the uterus. However, endometritis may be associated with localized, dis- crete adherent plaques or regional areas of bacterial or fungal infection.1,27Videoendoscopy can help identify areas of infection and allow for samplecollection (culture, cytology, biopsy) from affected areas (Figs. 5 and 6). 6. Evaluation of a Mare with Pyometra The term pyometra, as used in horses and cattle,r e f e r st ot h ea c c u m u l a t i o no fal a r g ev o l u m eo fi n flam- matory fluid associated with a chronic infection.28,29An open pyometra is associated with a patent cervix and a chronic or intermittent vaginaldischarge. In contrast, a closed pyometra impliesthat the cervix is not patent (i.e., closed or adheredshut), in which case there is no vaginal discharge de-spite accumulation of a large quantity of fluid in the uterus. A videoendoscopic examination can be usedto evaluate patency of the cervix (Fig. 7), the presenceof vaginal or cervical adhesions (Fig. 8), or Fig. 4.

Detection of Persistent Endometrial Cups Persistence of endometrial cups has been described in mares with an early termination of pregnancy, suchas fetal loss or abortion, and mares that carried a nor-mal pregnancy to term. 8,30,31Persistent endometrial cups have been associated with failure to show behav-ioral estrus, complete ovarian inactivity, sporadic fol-licular growth, and luteinization of partly developedfollicles. Diagnosis is based on observation of endo- metrial cups on ultrasonography per rectum, video- endoscopic and/or of equine chorionic go-nadotropin in peripheral blood. The functionallife span of persistent cups has been reported to be6t o3 0m o n t h s .8. Detection and Removal of Foreign Bodies Occasionally, a foreign body will be located within theuterine lumen of a mare.32-34Foreign bodies or sub- stances found within the uterine lumen of maresinclude a mummi ed fetus or fetal parts, the tip of a uterine culture instrument (Fig. 11) that fractured offduring sample collection, a marble intentionally placedin the uterus in an attempt to block behavioral estrus(Fig. 12), and residues or precipitates from intrauterinemedications. Initial detection may be made byrecognition of an echogenic object casting a shadowduring transrectal ultrasonography. Videoendoscopycan subsequently be used to con rm the diagnosis and facilitate removal using a grasping instrument orbasket passed down the biopsy channel (Figs. 13and 14). Fig. 8.

Detection and Removal of Fetal Remnants Death of an embryo or fetus early in gestation usually results in complete resorption or expulsion of thefluids and tissues. However, in some instances, fetal tissues may remain in the uterinelumen. 8Fetal death later in gestation usually results in abortion of the fetus, but on rare occa-sions, retention and subsequent mummi cation of the fetus may occur.34Initial indication of the retention of fetal tissue may be obtained by trans-rectal ultrasound visualization of an echogenicmass casting a shadow, and videoendoscopy canbe used to con rm the diagnosis. 35Smaller fetal remnants can be removed using either a graspinginstrument or basket passed down the biopsychannel of a videoendoscope (Fig. 15).10.

Confirmation of the Presence of Urine in the Uterus Vesico-vaginal re flux, or urine pooling, in the cranial vagina may lead to contamination of the uterus with urine during estrus when the cervix is open andrelaxed onto the floor of the vagina.43,44Urine con- tamination of the uterus leads to a chemical-inducedendometritis and results in decreased pregnancy rateor decreased ability to maintain a pregnancy. Urinein the uterus may be recognized on transrectal ultra-sound as a turbid, highly echogenic fluid usually at t h eb a s eo fau t e r i n eh o r no ri nt h eu t e r i n ebody.

The equine oviduct may become ob- structed by masses of collagen, broblast cells, and other debris, which may lead to a reduction infertility. 45-47Diagnosis of uterine tube pathology is usually made by exclusion once other potentialcauses of subfertility have been ruled out. A proce-dure termed \"hydrotubation \"has recently been devel- oped in which the uterine papillae is cannulatedand the uterine tube flushed in a retrograde fashion. 48The hydrotubation procedure has been used clinically as a technique to remove presumptiveoviductal masses and restore fertility potential inmares with unexplained infertility (Fig. 20). 49-51 Fig. 16.

Detection of Congenital Uterine Abnormalities Congenital abnormalities of the equine cervix and uterus are very rare. Abnormalities may includesegmental aplasia of the uterus, uterus didelphys,uterus unicornis, double cervix separateuterine horns (uterus bicorpor bicollis), and neoplasiaor metaplasia. 52-56Disorders of sexual development may be associated with an underdeveloped reproduc-tive tract, a complete absence of reproductive tissue ofM\u00fcllerian duct origin, or incomplete development ofthe reproductive tract. 57,58Congenital neoplastic or metaplastic conditions are also highly uncom-mon but should be considered in maiden mareswith detectable abnormalities in their reproduc-tive tract. Videoendoscopic examination is animportant diagnostic procedure to evaluate the in- tegrity of the reproductive tract of affected mares.14. Deep Horn, Low-Dose Insemination Traditional arti cial insemination with fresh semen involves deposition of 500 million progressively motile s p e r m a t o z o ai n t ot h eu t e r i n eb o d yt oa c h i e v em a x i - mum reproductive ef ciency.59Insemination of a small volume of semen containing a low number of spermatozoa has been reported to yield a higher preg- nancy rate if deposited onto or adjacent to the utero-tubular junction (UTJ) ipsilateral to the preovulatory follicle. 60A low dose of semen can be deposited using a manual transrectally guided deep horn approach or using a videoendoscope to visualize and deposit semen directly onto the UTJ via a catheter passed through the biopsy channel (Fig. 21).61-65 15. Evaluation of Endometrial Health V i d e o e n d o s c o p yc a nb eu s e dt ov i s u a l i z et h ee n t i r e surface of the mucosal or luminal surface of the equine uterus, allowing for gross evaluation of col-oration, vascular patterns, focal sites of infection, localized lesions, scarring, and other surface abnormalities. 8,66,67Videoendoscopic evaluation of small arteries visible under the endometrium was noted to be correlated with age-related gested that of the uteruscould be used as a noninvasive technique to esti-mate the degree of endometrosis and provide a prediction for reproductive ability of mares. In addition, narrow-band imaging through a video-endoscope was reported to allow for recognition of an endometrium affected by endometrosis and vessel degeneration subsequently con rmed by histopathology. 67 16. Summary Hysteroscopy is a procedure that can be used in the diagnosis and treatment of uterine ab- normalities. Videoendoscopy of the uterus canbe used diagnostically for detection of uterine issues such as intralumenal adhesions and persistent endometrial cups, as well as directed biopsyof focal uterine lesions or masses. Therapeutically, hysteroscopy can be used in the identi cation and re- moval of foreign bodies, the utero-tu- bular junction. It should be noted that the procedurecan be associated with iatrogenic infection or inflammation.

Authors 'addresses: Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences (Divine), 3101 Rampart Road (McCue), Colorado State Introduction Bacterial endometritis is one of the most common causes of reduced fertility in broodmares. Identi cation of infectious endometritis is based on a combination of reproductive history, trans- rectal ultrasonography, vaginal speculum exami-nation, as well as microbial culture and cytologicevaluation of a uterine sample and possibly histo-logic evaluation of a uterine biopsy. 1-6Uterine samples for culture may be collected by guardedswab, low-volume lavage, or in clinical practice include performingthe analysis in-house or sending samples to adiagnostic laboratory. Advantages of an in-houseculture system include a more rapid result, whichleads to improved patient care and reproductivemanagement and nancial savings by not paying an outside laboratory. Disadvantages includethe need for equipment and supplies, a dedicatedlaboratory space, as well as training and avail-ability of personnel. 2. Material and Methods Equipment and supplies needed to set up a basic mi-crobiology laboratory include an incubator, a refriger-ator, a biohazard waste container, microbial agarplates, disposable inoculating loops, disposable nitrileexam gloves, and a form for recording results. Oncea uterine sample has been collected, an agar plate isremoved from the refrigerator and allowed to equili-brate to room temperature and labeled prior touse. The \"quad plates \"used in the authors' clinical microbiology laboratory contain four different micro-bial agars a(tryptic agar; PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 249CLINICAL PERSPECTIVES ON MANAGING EQUINE UTERINE HEALTHLaboratory personnel should wear a laboratory coat and disposable nitrile gloves. The work area shouldbe clean and well maintained at all times and steri-lized with 70% ethanol and allowed to dry prior to each session. The sample swab is streaked onto the inner corner of each quadrant of the agar plate toform the primary streak. A disposable inoculatingloop is passed through the primary streak and appliedin a zigzag format across the rest of the quadrant toform a secondary streak. The goal of the secondarystreak is to spread out microbial growth so that indi-vidual colonies can be identi ed and selected for sub- sequent analysis if needed. The labeled plate is i n c u b a t e da g a rs i d eu pa t3 7 \u00b0 Ca n de v a l u a t e df o rm i - crobial growth at 24, 48, and 72 hours. At each ob- servation period, the presence or absence of microbialgrowth, amount of growth (very light growth, lightgrowth, moderate growth, and heavy growth), mor-phological characteristics of microbial colonies (circu-lar, irregular, pinpoint or punctiform, raised, flat), and presence of more than one colony type arerecorded for each agar type. In addition, the pres-ence or absence of hemolysis is noted for colonies pres-ent on tryptic soy agar blood agar. Finally, the presence of potential bacterial contaminants is noted. Pure growth of a single pathogenic organismon the primary streak and/or secondary streak is clini-cally signi cant. In contrast, growth of a single col- ony, growth outside of the primary or secondarystreaks, and/or growth of an aberrant colony typelikely represents a contaminating organism that is not clinically signi cant. In addition, if the organ- isms are contaminants of sample collection and/orprocessing, one would expect an absence of in flamma- tory cells on uterine cytology and an absence of fluid in the uterine lumen on ultrasonography. However,it has been noted that bacterial endometritis can be present in the absence of uterine in flammation. 7 3. Results Microbial growth characteristics for each of the four primary equine uterine pathogens on each agar type of the quad plate are described in Table 2 and pre- sented in Figs. 1 to 4. 4. Discussion Therst description of the use of chromogenic agar for equine uterine culture was by Beehan andM c K i n n o ni n2 0 0 9 . 2A recent study by Ferris and colleagues noted allowed to identi cation acquired by DNA sequencing.6In contrast, another group evaluated a different type of chromogenic agarboriginally mar- keted for detection and identi associated with urinary tract infections inpeople. 8Results of the latter study indicated thatTable 1. Agar Types in the Quad Plate Used in the Culture of Equine Microbial Pathogens Agar Type Characteristics Tryptic soy agar Tryptic soy is an all-purpose medium that supports the growth of bacteria that do not have a speci c nutritional need. Addition of 5% sheep red blood cells to the agar allows for a visual differentia- tion of some bacterial organisms due to various types of hemolysis: \u0081Alpha-hemolysis: partial hemolysis, often appears as a zone of green, gray, or brown discoloration around the colony \u0081Beta-hemolysis: clear, colorless zone caused by complete hemolysis of the red blood cells MacConkey II agar MacConkey agar utilizes bile salts and crystal violet to inhibit the growth of most Gram-positive bacteria and most Gram-negative cocci, thus selecting for Gram-negative bacilli (i.e., rods). This agar can also be used as a visual differentiation medium based on the bacteria 's ability or inabil- ity to ferment lactose. Organisms that ferment lactose produce acid, which turns the acid indica- tor (phenol red) in the agar a reddish or pink color. Strong lactose fermenters will produce red colonies surrounded by a pink ring of precipitated bile salts. Nonlactose fermenters will produce colorless or transparent colonies. It is important for these plates to be checked within 24 hoursas continued incubation will yield altered results as the bacteria use up the available lactose, leading to misrepresented color characteristics. Chromogenic agar Chromogenic agar is an all-purpose medium. the presumptive identi cation of bacte- rial organisms based on production of a color compound in the bacterial colonies. Chromogenicagar contains substrates (chromogens) that release a particular colored compound when degraded by speci c microbial enzymes. It is important to have an accurate description of colors produced by microbial organisms incubated on chromogenic media produced by a speci c manufacturer. In addition, bacterial colony growth and color characteristics should be interpreted within 24 hoursas the colors may change with continued incubation. Chromogenic Gram-positive agar will only sustain growth of Gram-positive organisms, while chromogenic Gram-negative agar will only sustain growth of Gram-negative organisms.CLINICAL PERSPECTIVES ON MANAGING EQUINE UTERINE HEALTH 250 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSonly 50% of equine uterine bacterial isolates were cor- rectly identi ed based on color characteristics using the urinary tract infection agar. The difference inresults in the two studies emphasizes the fact that notall chromogenic microbial agars are the same and for identi cation of equine uterine pathogens. In addition to use of the quad plate mi-crobial agar system, there are several other techni-ques that can be used to help identify microbialorganisms, including a catalase test, urease test, andGram stain. A Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion systemcan be used to obtain antimicrobial susceptibilityresults and direct appropriate treatment of uterineTable 2: Culture Characteristics for Common Bacterial Pathogens Associated with Infectious Equine Endometritis Organism Gram (\u00df-hemolysis)No growth Pinpoint blue colonies Escherichia coli Negative Rods Circular cream colonies (6 alpha hemolysis)Small circular or irregular pink coloniesCircular or irregular pink colonies Klebsiella pneumoniae Negative Rods Gray mucoid colonies Pink mucoid colonies Circular dark blue colonies (6 slight pink halo)Positive urease test (hot pink) Pseudomonas aeruginosa Negative Rods Irregular, flat, metallic blue or gray colonies (\u00df- hemolysis)Irregular cream or gray coloniesIrregular pale green or yel- low colonies\"Grape-like \"odor, fluorescence with Wood 's UV light Fig. 1.

These techniques, although valuable, are not covered within the scope of this paper. In theevent that microbial growth characteristics are not consistent with a known bacterial organism, it is rec- ommended that the initial culture swab or cultureplate be submitted to a diagnostic laboratory for fur-ther evaluation using advanced biochemical analysis,matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time offlight spectrometry, or polymerase chain reaction analysis. 6In summary, a basic microbiology labora- tory can be set up in any veterinary clinic or breedingfarm. The techniques described can be used inequine veterinary practice to ef ciently obtain micro- bial culture results, which would allow for an accurateearly diagnosis and subsequent implementation of atherapeutic protocol.

Automatized commerciala,b and manual protocols have been described for intrau-terine infusion in mares. Practitioners wanting tos t a r tu s i n gP R Po ra l r e a d yu s i n gi ti nr e p r o d u c t i v epractice with mares may be confused with the numer-ous options available and not be able to understandall protocols available consistently. Commercial pro-tocols offer the advantage of being standardized andless human dependent; however, the high cost ofacquiring the machines and supplies may discouragepractitioners to routinely use PRP. Conversely,manual methods do not require specialized equipment and can be an affordable alternative to produce PRP. In addition, the majority of protocols are ablet op r o d u c eas m a l lv o l u m eo fP R P( ;2t o5m L )f o r intra-articular or intratendinous injection.

Methods Regardless of the method used to prepare PRP, wholeblood (WB) has to be aseptically collected by venipunc-ture of the jugular vein. The authors typically scrubthe overlying skin with three rounds of povidone io-dine or chlorhexidine scrub followed by three roundswith 70% isopropyl alcohol. The placement of an in-travenous catheter is not mandatory but may beplaced in needle-shy horses or in case the practitioner NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 253CLINICAL PERSPECTIVES ON MANAGING EQUINE UTERINE HEALTHis not comfortable drawing a large amount of blood off a needle. Also, the authors typically use 1.5-inch 18- gauge needles to avoid platelet damage and activationduring the blood drawing. Following collection, theblood can be left at room temperature ( ;22\u00b0C) for 2-3 hours until processing with no apparent detrimentaleffects to PRP quality. Protocols to prepare PRP canbe classi ed as manual or automated. The rst type has the advantage of requiring minimal equipment and being low cost but is more time consuming, whereas the latter has the advantage of being stand-ardized and requiring less labor but demands acquisi-tion of expensive processing systems. The non- commercial methods are described herein, and the step-by-step of commercial systems a-fcan be found on the manufacturers 'webpages. Noncommercial Methods Single Centrifugation in Vacutainer Tubes Blood is collected in 4.5-mL vacutainer tubes contain- ing 3.2% sodium citrate and immediately gently homogenized. Blood tubes are then centrifuged at 120/C2gfor 10 minutes. In each tube after centrifuga- tion, the top third layer of the plasma is discarded, while the remaining plasma adjacent to the buffy coat is recovered as PRP (Fig. 1). Double Centrifugation in Vacutainer Tubes Blood is harvested in 4.5-mL vacutainer tubes contain- ing 3.2% sodium citrate. Citrated be slowly homogenized and centrifuged at 120 /C2gfor 10 minutes. After the rst centrifugation, the upper 30% of the plasma can be discarded. The remainingplasma (70%) adjacent to the buffy coat should be gently recovered and transferred to 10-mL tubes with- out anticoagulant. This fraction is submitted toanother centrifugation at 240 /C2gfor 10 minutes. After the second centrifugation, ;30% of plasma at the bottom of each tube is considered as PRP (Fig. 2). Double Centrifugation in Blood Transfusion Bag Whole blood is collected in a 450-mL blood transfusion bag containing 63 mL of citrate-phosphate-dextrose so- lution with adenine as an anticoagulant (CPD-A). Four hundred milliliters of WB should be split into eight 50-mL tubes and centrifuged at 400 /C2gfor15 minutes. After the rst centrifugation, the plasma fraction is recovered and transferred into 15-mL coni-cal tubes. This fraction is submitted to centrifugation at 1000 /C2gfor 10 minutes. After the second centrifu- gation, 2.5 mL of plasma at the bottom of each tube ispreserved as PRP (Fig. 3). Sedimentation Blood is collected using an 18-gauge needle into a 60- mL syringe pre lled with 7 mL of anticoagulant (CPD-A). Right after collection, each syringe should be wrapped in aluminum foil and placed in an upright position at room temperature. Four hours later, thetop 10 mL of plasma can be discarded as platelet-poorplasma (PPP), whereas the remaining sedimented plasma can be recovered as PRP (Fig. 4). For this, the syringe is kept in an upright position, a 21-gauge but-terfly catheter can be connected to the syringe, and PRP and PPP are recovered by applying steady pres-sure to the syringe 'sp l u n g e r . 14 3. Discussion The cell composition, as well as soluble factors reported in the PRP produced by different methods, are highlighted in Table 1. All methods, but oned, were reported to be able to improve platelet concen- tration in PRP compared with the WB. Although the cell composition cannot be compared among resultsfrom different studies, it is important to note thatthere is a discrepancy in the volume of blood har- vested to produce PRP, the nal volume of PRP, and the number of platelets and leukocytes in PRP from different studies, which can impact for intrauterineinfusion in mares.

Also, there were differences in thetime and protocols of treatment and volume of PRPamong studies. A summary of protocols used to obtain PRP, the respective platelet concentration, vol- ume of plasma, time of uterine infusion, endometrialinflammatory markers, and fertility of mares is high- lighted in Table 2. One of the rst reports using PRP in mares described the postbreeding expression ofinflammatory cytokines in the endometrium of barren mares treated with intrauterine PRP. 2The protocolused in that study to produce PRP applied a specializedblood fractionated machine. aAlthough the cell com- position of the PRP was not described and the PRP was mixed with PPP for intrauterine infusion, the treatment reduced endometrial expression of proin-flammatory cytokines (IL1 b,I L 6 ,a n dC X L 8 )2in this group of mares. Later, another study,3using the same technique to produce PRP and treating barrenmares showed that intrauterine PRP therapy a response lowered intrauterine fluid accumulation and improved fertility when compared to the untreatedcycle. 3Although in these studies the cell composition of PRP was not reported, another study using the same Fig. 2.

The mares were treated 4 hours after insemination with the intrauterine infusion of 20 mL of PRP and had lower uterine fluid and PMN counts in endome- trial cytology postbreeding. In that study, 100 mL ofWB was harvested in vacutainer tubes and then cen-trifuged at 120 /C2gfor 10 minutes, then after the rst centrifugation, the lower 70% of the plasma was fur-ther centrifuged at 240 /C2gfor 10 minutes. This protocol yielded 20 mL of PRP containing250/C210 3of platelets/ mLa n d ;5/C2109platelets per treatment.4Later, the same group compared the previously published treatment times byinfusing PRP, either 24 hours before or 4 hours af-ter insemination, and demonstrated that bothtime points reduced endometrial PMN counts andCOX2 expression in mares susceptible to PBIE, aswell as improved pregnancy rates of mares. 5In that study, PRP was produced by single centrifugation invacutainer tubes. For this, 45 mL of WB was col-lected in 4.5-mL sodium citrate tubes and centrifugedonce at 120 /C2gfor 10 minutes; the protocol yielded 20 mL of PRP with platelet concentration of354617/C210 3of platelets/ mLa n d7 60.3/C2109plate- lets per treatment.5Most recently, PRP produced by another commercially available systembwas reported in a clinical trial to treat mares that did not become pregnant after insemination with frozen semen. Similar to the early studies, the authors did not pro-vide the cell composition of PRP used for treatment;however, 61% of the mares treated with PRP becamepregnant after insemination with frozen semen. 1In a most recent study, the effect of PRP and PPP wastested on postbreeding endometrial in flammation and fertility. 6PRP and PPP were obtained after the collec- tion of WB (450 mL) in a blood transfusion bag anddouble centrifuged. The mean number of plateletsinfused in the uterus of mares was 24.9 61.2/C210 9 platelets in PRP and 1.4 60.2/C2109platelets in PPP. Embryo donor mares susceptible to PBIEwere treated four times (two before and two afterinsemination) during the estrous cycle with 40 mLof one of the treatments. Interestingly, bothplasma therapies reduced the postbreeding Fig. 4. Representative images of sedimentation method using a 60-mL syringe to produce platelet-rich plasma (PRP).

E, Four hours later, the top 10 mL of plasma is considered as platelet-poor plasma (PPP) and the remaining plasma until the sedimented blood cells should be recovered as PRP.CLINICAL PERSPECTIVES ON MANAGING EQUINE UTERINE HEALTH 256 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSinflammation (PMN counts, uterine fluid, and inflammatory cytokines); however, PRP appa- rently had additional immunomodulatory proper- ties. In addition, the results of the studysuggested that PRP may have antimicrobial prop-erties as PRP therapy reduced the number of uter-ine infections after breeding in embryo donormares susceptible to PBIE. 6It is important to note that many of the commercially availabletechniques produce a much-reduced volume ofPRP than the manual methods. In the earlystudies applying a specialized blood fractionatedmachine, a,2,3the PRP was diluted in PPP to reach the volume for intrauterine infusion. It is an im-portant factor that should be considered in brood-mare 'sp r a c t i c ea si ti sa s s u m e dt h a th i g h e r volume (e.g., 10 -60 mL) is required to reach the entire uterus. 16It is not yet clear the optimal cell composition of PRP for uterine infusion orwhether there is a synergism between the bene - cial effects of PRP and platelet concentration.Also, the effects of white and red blood cells inPRP are not well known. The PRP' se fcacy in mitigating PBIE has been attributed to therelease of GFs, cytokines, and active plateletmetabolites. 8,17It has been suggested that the greater number of platelets would release higherlevels of desirable molecules and presumably pro-duce better clinical response; 18,19however, this sug- gestion did not seem to be supported by a studytesting different protocols to produce PRP in horses asthere was no correlation between platelet counts andrelease of GFs in that study. 12Although the immu- nomodulatory properties have been described inplasma and PRP with lower platelet concentrations,20 in a recent study, the PRP' s antimicrobial properties were associated with the platelet concentration as nomares treated with PRP therapy developed positive aerobic endometrial culture 3 and 9 days postbreed- ing,6and 30% of these mares had positive bacte- rial cultures at the same time points when treatedwith PPP. The antimicrobial activity of PRP hasbeen described in humans and horses againstStaphylococcus aureus ,Escherichia coli ,a n d Klebsiella pneumoniae , 10,11,21,22which are known causes of endometritis in mares.23However, further studies are needed to determine whether the PRP' s properties could be ampli ed by increasing platelet concentrations and its clinical ef cacy. Worth not- ing, intrauterine infusion of PRP is often carried outwithout platelet activation. Presumably, activationhappens once the platelets interact with the uterinelumen 5; however, this has yet to be con rmed. Of in- terest, in vitro PRP is associated with sustainedrelease of GFs over a minimum of 4 days when relyingon endogenous activation only. 19Intra-articular infusion of PRP is also carried out without platelet activation under the same assumption that platelets get activated when exposed to the lumen of ajoint.24In topical use, PRP is activated, and it acquires a gel consistency, which is desirableTable 1.

Some studies suggest that leukocytesare undesirable cells in the PRP for treating jointsand tendons. 20,26High amounts of leukocytes can intensify the undesirable effects of in flammatory response, induce cellular catabolism, decreaseextracellular matrix synthesis in tissues, andincrease the release of proin flammatory cyto- kines, which may cause tissue damage. 27,28 Neutrophils are the body's rst line of defense and the most critical cell in uterine defense.These cells are already in the uterus about30 minutes after semen contact with the endome-trium 29and have a peak in flammatory reaction between 6 and 12 hours, being eliminated up to48 hours in mares with a competent immunesystem. 30Postbreeding therapies such as uter- ine lavage aimed to prevent an excess of neutro-phils and in flammatory molecules in the uterus of mares susceptible to PBIE as this is thought to bedetrimental for a controlled immune response. 16 However, one study suggested that intrauterine infu-sion of white blood cells (WBCs) could faster eliminatebacterial contamination from the uterus of mares sus-ceptible to PBIE. 31In addition, removal of red blood cells seems bene cial as an excess of blood can be detri- mental to sperm, limiting its use prebreeding.32 Controversy exists on whether fresh WBCs and redblood cells from blood could affect the uterine in flamma- tory response and if including WBCs from WB in PRPcan be bene cial for the treatment of PBIE in mares. Other methods to prepare PRP c,e,f(sedimentation) that have not been tested in mare' s practice are pre- sented in this manuscript. The authors chose to include these methods since all of them have been tested for cell composition and have produced satisfac-tory platelet concentration after processing, and theyare available for use clinical practice. 12-14In addi- tion, one producteand sedimentation protocol11can be performed in eld situations when there is no equipment available for processing PRP.12,14One commercially available systemdmay ts o m ep r a c t i - tioner prospects; however, this last one should betested for cell composition before being incorporated inequine practice. In the sedimentation method, thered blood fraction is separated by gravity. Thismethod takes a bit longer to be processed ( ;4h o u r s ) and produces PRP with higher WBC concentrationthan other methods. 14V-PETTMconsists of two blood bags attached to a lter. Blood is added to the blood bag and passes through the lter under gravity. The platelets are retained into the lter by a complex inter- action of size exclusion and adsorption. When the l- tration is completed, the lter is isolated, and a harvest solution is back flushed through the lter to recover the PRP. This protocol also has beendescribed to yield PRP with great platelet concentra-tion and higher WBCs than baseline. 12Therefore, in vivo studies are warranted to assess the clinicalefcacy of PRP obtained by these three methods in mitigating PBIE in mares. Of interest, the anti-coag- ulants reported for processing PRP differ among proto-cols.4-6,12,14The acid citrate dextrose solution (ACD- A) is the most cited in the experiments, followed by so-dium citrate and citrate-phosphate-dextrose with ade-nine (CPD-A). 1-5Some protocolsa,b,c,e,fdescribed in the present study have the kit provided by the manu-facturer and use ACD-A as an anticoagulant. Thereare two studies that suggested that ACD-A has an in- ferior capacity to maintain platelet viability compared to CPD-A and sodium citrate. 33,34However, it should be clari ed in the methods presented in the current study if changing the anticoagulant in these protocolscan affect platelet viability and PRP composition. Inconclusion, the methods described here are availableto practitioners to produce PRP for intrauterine infu-sion in mares. It is important to note that PRP is nota standardized medical product. Therefore, varia-tions can be observed between practitioners, methods,and animals. Some of the techniques presented in this manuscript require additional clinical trials to prove their ef cacy. PRP is a safe and easy product for use in broodmare 's practice.

Von Dollen, DVM, Medical 40511 (Von Dollen, Wolfsdorf, Levkulic, Elam, Lu); Department of Veterinary Science, University of Kentucky, 1400 Nicholasville Road, Lexington, KY is a leading cause of reproductive inef - ciency in broodmares. Accurate diagnosis is critical in formulating an effective treatment plan. Multiplemethods for obtaining endometrial samples for cul-ture and cytology exist, with a range of associated sen- sitivity and speci city patterns. 1-3Endometrial sampling by low-volume lavage has been heralded for good-quality results4and offers an advantage over swab/brush techniques through sampling of a greatersurface area of the endometrium. This may be ofparticular advantage in mares with a history ofsubfertility. The presence of mucus within the equineuterus has been considered and explored as a factorinfluencing a mare 's reproductive soundness. 5N-ace- tylcysteine (NAC), a mucolytic that acts through dis-ruption of disul de bonds linking mucin, has been harnessed in equine reproductive practice as an anti-biolm agent 6and has been demonstrated to improve reproductive performance.7Operating the hy- pothesis that endometrial mucus may harbor bacteriaand prevent their diagnosis through traditional sam-pling methods such as swab/brush or low-volumelavage, the impact of NAC infusion on uterine cultureand cytology results was investigated. 2. Materials and Methods Fifty-nine mares (58 Thoroughbreds and 1 Warmblood),barren from the 2020 breeding season, were evaluatedbetween August and December 2020. Mares includedwere examined during the course of routine clinical prac-tice in Lexington, KY. Day 0 On day 0, 1-L of sterile lactated Ringer 's solution was instilled into the uterus and immediately col-lected back into the original bottle. Following this1-L lavage, each mare was infused with 3.3% NAC(20 mL 20% N-acetylcysteine with 100 mL sterile0.9% saline). A neat sample of lavage fluid (approximately 3 mL) was retained for turbidityanalysis. The sample of neat lavage fluid was ana- lyzed using a densimeter ato obtain an objective measure of turbidity. A cuvette of water was usedto zero the machine reading. Then, 1.8 mL of la-vage fluid was added to a new cuvette and the NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 261CLINICAL PERSPECTIVES ON MANAGING EQUINE UTERINE HEALTHsample turbidity measured. The remaining uter- ine lavage fluid was submitted the same day for standard processing for culture and cytology. The 1-L bottle was allowed to rest undisturbed for onehour to encourage sediment formation at the bottom of the bottle. The sediment was aspirated using a pipette and divided into two with 5% Sheep Blood, and MacConkey Agar, with the other prepared on amicroscope slide and stained with Diff-Quik and Gram stain for cytologic evaluation. Bacterial growth was reported as no growth, scant ( <10 col- ony forming units), light (growth on one quadrant ofplate only), moderate (growth on two quadrants of plate), or heavy (growth on three quadrants of plate). While the cytology results were reported inmore detail than white blood cell evaluation alone,cytology results were compared between patient samples based on the number of white blood cells present (none, rare: 0-1 > 10 per high-power eld). A negative cytology was de ned as no or rare white blood cells present, with all others de ned as a positive cytology result. To minimize operatorvariation, all cytology slides for this project were read by one of two trained laboratory technicians. Day 1 The following day, each mare had the above lavage culture procedure repeated in an identical fashion (instillation of 1-L sterile lactated Ringer 'ss o l u - tion, collected immediately back into the originalbottle). Laboratory sampling and processingprocedures were performed as above. Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed using SAS\u00ae 9.4 using varying models depending on the data. Quantitative/continuous data means were analyzed utilizing an independent-group Ttest to make comparisons on means. Qualitative/cate-gorical data were analyzed utilizing a chi-squared test for comparisons of proportions. Signi cance was set to P<0.05. 3. Results On day 0, 81% (48/59) of samples were cytologically negative, with 27% (16/59) cytologically negative the following day. This was not unexpected as any intra- luminal manipulation of the uterus is likely to incitean in flammatory response. On day 0, 63% (37/59) of samples had no bacterial growth, 20% growth, 10% (6/59) (4/59) had moderate bacterial growth, andnone had heavy bacterial growth. The following day, these bacterial growth pro les changed to 31% (18/59) no Forty-eight mares had a negative cy- tology and no or scant bacterial growth on day0. These 48 mares would reasonably have been desig-nated \"clean \"by a practitioner based on these results. However, following NAC infusion, 17 of thesemares (35%) displayed an in flammatory cytology and an increase in bacterial growth to light (5 mares), mod- erate (10 mares), or heavy (2 mares). Turbidity val- ues were reported in million cells/mL and ranged from0 to 135 for day-0 samples and 0 to 946 for day-1samples. A threshold value of 50 million cells/mL wasestablished as a cutoff for negative (below 50 millioncells/mL) or positive (above 50 million cells/mL) den- simeter results. Ninety-two percent (54/59) 75% of sam-ples were negative. Densimeter result was - cantly associated with culture result, with 100% ofthose mares displaying an increase in densimeter read-i n gf r o mn e g a t i v et op o s i t i v ea l s oh a v i n ga ni n c r e a s ei nbacterial culture grade ( p<0.01). However, if den- simeter reading remained negative on day 0 and day 1,only 36% of those samples had an increase in bacterialculture grade ( p<0.05). 4. Discussion The inclusion of NAC infusion prior to uterine lavage for culture and cytology has facilitated the diagnosis of a notable number of mares with bacterial endome- tritis that may otherwise have gone undetected bystandard diagnostic methods. It is presumed thatsome mares produce a layer of mucus that acts to pro-tect bacteria and prevent their detection, and only bydisrupting this mucus layer are they able to be accu- rately diagnosed. Objective assessment of lavage fluid turbidity via densimeter was included in an attempt to relate the gross appearance of lavage ef flux with labo- ratory ndings. A very strong association between gross turbidity of a lavage and its likelihood of growingbacteria was found, making this an exciting potentialadjunct diagnostic tool, especially in clinical settings that may have limited opportunities for performing cy- tology and must be selective in which samples are sub-mitted for culture due to budgetary concerns. By nom e a n si st h i sd i a g n o s t i cm e t h o dp r o p o s e da sar e p l a c e -ment for cytology and culture. As this project was undertaken during clinical practice, there are inherent limitations to designand interpretation. First and foremost, no control groups were available to rigorously test the hypothesis. Control groups would have allowed forassessment of the in fluence of the low-volume la- vage process itself on the following day' s results, as well as shed light on the potential role of any vagi-nal contamination during the lavage and infusion processes. Despite this drawback, the authors opine that this procedure has greatly enhanced theability to diagnose (and subsequently treat) endo-metritis in mares.CLINICAL PERSPECTIVES ON MANAGING EQUINE UTERINE HEALTH 262 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSAcknowledgments The Authors are deeply grateful for the efforts of the Hagyard Laboratory Staff, whose skills are matched only by their kindness and willingness to collaborate on clinical research.

Introduction In Quarter Horses (QHs), fetal age can be predicted within 2 weeks prior to 200 days of gestation via ultra-sound, but as pregnancy advances, accuracydecreases. In this study, P1 is evaluated for itslength and for the time of appearance and closure ofits secondary ossi cation centers after 240 days of gestation. 2. Materials and Methods Eight healthy pregnant mares (7 Quarter Horses and1 Thoroughbred carrying a QH fetus) with knownarticial insemination and ovulation dates were used. Fetuses were ultrasounded transrectallyevery 2 weeks, from 9 months of gestation untilparturition. At each examination, the length ofthe ossi ed portion of P1 'sm a i no s s i cation cen- ter was measured, and the presence or absence ofthe secondary ossi cation centers (proximal and distal) was documented. 3. Results P1 was observed in most examinations. However, in29.5% (18/61) of examinations, P1 was not seen due tofetal presentation (1 posterior presentation) or pos-ture (carpal or fetlock flexion). In some mares, addi- tional examinations were performed to obtaindata. On few occasions (4/61) in late gestation, P1from hind limbs were measured while front limbscould not be seen because they were located too deepin the uterus. P1 length correlated strongly with Research Abstract \u2014for more information, contact the corresponding author NOTES 264 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSCLINICAL PERSPECTIVES ON MANAGING EQUINE UTERINE HEALTHdays of gestation (P <0.0001). A was established: y = 0.3668x -64.43 (y=p r e d i c t e d value of P1 length; x= gestational age). The proxi- mal and distal ossi cation centers both appeared between 277 and 303 days of gestation ( 6 2 weeks). The proximal ossi cation center did not close as opposed to the distal one that closed between 313 and 333 days of gestation ( 6 2w e e k s ) . 4. Discussion P1 length can be used as a novel biometric parameterduring late gestation, and the presence or absence ofits ossi cation centers can serve as markers of bone maturation in QHs. Fetal ultrasonographic assess-ment of proper bone development may be used in thefuture in the decision-making process of inducing par-turition in the mare.Acknowledgments This project was supported by the Center for Equine Health with funds provided by the State ofCalifornia satellite wagering fund and contributionsby private donors and by Fuji lm Sonosite who generously provided the ultrasound machine.

Authors 'address: Equine Reproduction Laboratory, Colorado State University, Rampart Collecting equine oocytes from deceased mares for in- vitro embryo production through the use of intracyto-plasmic sperm injection (ICSI) has been commerciallyavailable since 2005 and is considered an equineemergency. This retrospective analysis providesunique insight into clinical data from inception. 2. Materials and Methods Data was collected from January 2005 throughDecember 2020 and evaluated: the total number ofoocytes collected, the number of oocytes reachingmetaphase II compared to the total rate), number injected oocytes (cleavage rate rate). Utilizing the development of anembryo to the blastocyst stage as an endpoint, statisti-cal comparisons were made evaluating timing fromdeath, ovarian temperature upon arrival, and sementype. Statistical analysis was performed utilizingone-way ANOVA tests and signi cance established at P0.05.3. Results In total, 168 sets of ovaries were evaluated yielding1,524 oocytes. An overall maturation rate of 41%(620) was identi ed, cleavage rate of 40% (246), and blastocyst rate of 19% (117). There was a linearassociation between temperature on arrival of ovariesfrom deceased mares and the likelihood of obtainingan embryo that successfully develops to a blastocyststage (P \u00bc0.003). However, there was no association between transportation time and semen choice (P \u00bc 0.17 and P \u00bc0.65, respectively). 4. Discussion This is the rst clinical retrospective analysis deter- mining successful blastocyst development derivedfrom equine postmortem ovary collections from a dataset this large. Although often uncontrollable, refer-ring veterinarians can improve successful outcomesby understanding the importance of variables such astemperature during transportation and make everyeffort to ship ovaries while maintaining temperaturesbetween 15 -25\u00b0C.

DVM Impostor syndrome is seen commonly in medical professionals and can adversely affect career suc- cess and satisfaction. The characteristics of impostor syndrome include: self-doubt; inability to accu- rately judge your own abilities; giving the credit of your success to other external factors; overachieving; constant fear of not standing up to the expectations of people; self-sabotage; fear of isolation, exposure, and rejection; rumination; and anxiety and depression.1Overcoming this condi- tion requires self-awareness and diligence in reshaping mindset.

Introduction Impostor syndrome is de ned by the Oxford Dictionary as \"the persistent inability to believe that one's success is deserved or has been legitimately achieved as a result of one's own efforts or skills. \" First described in a research paper in 1978,2the syn- drome has subsequently been found in people of alldemographics and is common in the medicalelds. A recent review of the literature published in 2020, utilizing 62 studies and over 14,000 subjects,found that 9% -82% of people experience impostor syndrome. The numbers vary depending on whoparticipates in a study but revealed that impostorsyndrome was common among both men and womenand across a range of age groups (adolescents to late-stage professionals). 22. Discussion Psychologists rst described and named impostor syn- drome in 1978.2The authors wrote, \"In our clinical e x p e r i e n c e ,w eh a v ef o u n dt h a tt h ep h e n o m e n o noccurs with much less frequency in men and thatwhen it does occur, it is with much less intensity ... Attribution research ndings imply that the impostor phenomenon would be found less frequently in menthan in women ...Unlike men, who tend to own suc- cess as attributable to a quality inherent in them-selves, women are more likely either to project thec a u s eo fs u c c e s so u t w a r dt oa ne x t e r n a lc a u s e( l u c k )or to a temporary internal quality (effort) that they donot equate with inherent ability. \" 2 Subsequent studies have found that this disorder affects people of all ages, races, genders, and career NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 275IMPROVING YOUR PRACTICE, FINANCIAL, AND EMOTIONAL WELLBEINGpaths, though it is over-represented in highly edu- cated professionals. According to Gill Corkindale, writing for the Harvard Business Review, \"Imposter syndrome can be de ned as a collection of feelings of inadequacy that persist despite evident success. 'Imposters' suffer from chronic self-doubt and a sense of intellectual fraudulence that override anyfeelings of success or external proof of theircompetence. They seem unable to internalizetheir accomplishments, however successful theyare in their eld. High achieving, highly success- ful people often suffer, so impostor syndromedoesn 't equate with low self-esteem or a lack of self-con dence. In fact, some researchers have linked it with perfectionism, especially in womenand among academics.\" 3 P a u l i n eR o s eC l a n c e ,o n eo ft h ea u t h o r so ft h e ground-breaking 1978 study, developed a validatedtest for the presence of impostor syndrome. This test can be accessed at: https://paulineroseclance.com/pdf/ IPTestandscoring.pdf. Subsequently, other re-searchers created additional screening tests. A sys-tematic review of the literature published in 2020 byBravata et al. stated that clinicians lacked evidenceon the prevalence, comorbidities, and best practicesfor diagnosing and treating impostor syndrome andthat its actual effects on professional performanceand burnout both among healthcare professionals andothers were not known. Consequently, the purposeof their study was to \"critically evaluate the published literature on impostor syndrome\u2014 specically to eval- uate the prevalence of impostor syndrome inemployed populations, characterize its relationship toworkplace performance and burnout, characterizecommon comorbidities, and determine the most effec-tive treatments for populations suffering from impos- tor symptoms. \" 7 Few of the studies reviewed by Bravata et al. were designed to assess the prevalence of impostor syn- drome, which was found to vary widely from 9 to82%, largely depending on the screening tool and cut-off used to assess symptoms. When considering gen-der, thirty-three of the sixty two articles reviewedcompared the rates of impostor syndrome bygender. Sixteen of these found that women reportedstatistically signi cantly higher rates of impostor feel- ings than men, and 17 studies found no difference inrates of impostor syndrome. However, a reviewedstudy by Hutchins et al. found that men and womencope differently with their impostor feelings. 4The Bravata review article included six studies that com-pared the rates of impostor syndrome by age, half ofwhich reported that impostor symptoms declined with age, but the other studies did not have this nding. Many articles included in the review explored psychological issues that were found to fre-quently co-exist with impostor syndrome, includingdepression, anxiety, low self-esteem, physical symp-toms, and social dysfunctions. Importantly, amonghigh school students, a history of prior suicidal idea-tion, suicide attempts, and depression were correlatedsignicantly with impostor syndrome. 4According to Dr. Colleen Best, \"Imposter syndrome can be self-rein- forcing; doubt in one 's ability in one area can spread to others. Sometimes that becomes a self-ful lling prophecy as we begin to look for evidence that thisnegative self-impression is correct. \"5Because human survival has always depended on the ability to recog-nize danger, a negativity bias exists that causes nega-tive experiences, emotions, and thoughts to dominateover the positive. By being aware of this bias, a per-son can look more objectively at his or herperformance. 5Five types of behaviors common to those with impostor syndrome were categorized byDr. Valerie Young. They include perfectionism, ex-pertise, soloist, over-achieving, and natural genius. 6 Perfectionists set excessively high goals for them- selves, and then, when they fail to meet their stand-ard, they experience self-doubt and anxiety aboutmeasuring up. Because these people have a high need for control, they may feel like if they want some- t h i n gd o n er i g h t ,t h e yh a v et od oi tt h e m s e l v e s . T h i soften leads to micromanaging, failure to delegate,and excessive rumination about deviations fromperfection. Because of these impossible standards,perfectionists always believe they could have per-formed better. By nding minor flaws, they exert negative pressure on themselves rather than lookingat the positive aspects of their experience. This leadsto dissatisfaction and unhappiness. 6 Those that exhibit expertise behavioral traits mea- sure their competence based on their knowledge baseand skillset. Because there is an ever growing bodyof knowledge, they believe they will never knowenough and have a fear of being exposed as inad-equately prepared or unknowledgeable. They fre-quently seek out training or certi cations to improve their skills in order to prevent their lack of knowledgefrom being discovered. If or when they are termedan expert, they feel anxious rather than proud. Thiscan be particularly daunting for doctors who grad-uated many years ago. 6 Soloists prefer working alone and feel asking for help is a sign of weakness. They have the need to ac-complish things on their own without assistance. Ifforced to ask for assistance with something, they willframe the request in terms of the needs of the patient,typically, rather than their needs as a person. 6 The behavior of over-achievers is to always feel that they have not done enough. They will under-rate their own worth and feel inadequate comparedto their colleagues. Because of this, they often pushthemselves to work harder and harder to assuagetheir insecurities. These people may becomestressed when they are not working because they interpret downtime as unproductive. As a result, they abandon hobbies and passions as they strive tofeel worthy by sacri cing themselves at work. This need for external validation is common among thosewith impostor syndrome. Unfortunately, the excessworkload may harm not only their own mental health,but also their relationships with others. 6IMPROVING YOUR PRACTICE, FINANCIAL, AND EMOTIONAL WELLBEING 276 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSThose with natural genius behaviors have been nurtured to believe they have unusual talent, and as a result, their internal standards are set very high. They believe they must complete the work per-fectly on the rst attempt or they feel a sense of failure. Because they judge their competence basedon ease and speed as opposed to the quality of theirresults, they may experience shame if they struggle tomaster something. Those that have excelled withoutmuch effort in the past and were told by their familyof origin that they were \"at the top \"can struggle with shame when they encounter dif culty. Because these people feel they should be able to excel on theirown, they may dislike the idea of mentors and avoidchallenges because it is uncomfortable to try some-thing new that may be hard to accomplishimmediately. 6 In human medicine, LaDonna et al. reported on physicians 'struggles with impostor syndrome, stating \"Mistakes are ubiquitous in medicine; when con- fronted by error, physicians may experience anxiety,guilt, and self-doubt. Feedback may be useful fornavigating these feelings, but only if it matches aphysician 's self-assessment; self-doubt and the impostor syndrome are examples of inaccurate self-assessments that may affect receptivity to feed-back. The impact of real or imagined underperform-ance on seemingly competent physicians is poorlyunderstood. \"They concluded, \"Despite identifying coping strategies, feelings of inadequacy persisted forseveral participants; medicine was perceived to be aculture with few opportunities to share thesestruggles. Participants described that self-doubt,and the impostor syndrome were taboo subjects; con-ding or seeking help for these feelings equated to 'an admission of perceived weakness '.E v e n c o n s u l t a n t participants who had found it 'very helpful, and prob- ably validating 'for a senior colleague to speak openly about these feelings often did not share their experi-ences with their colleagues or with their learners. \" In addition, the authors shared that \"Many partici- pants \u2014even those at advanced career stages \u2014 questioned the validity of their achievements; progres-sive independence and career advancement were vari-ably experienced as 'rising to the level of your incompetence. '\"They concluded that even positive feedback could not buffer participants 'insecurities, which participants rarely shared with their col-leagues, self-doubt affects clinicians variably at all ca-reer stages, and medical culture must create space forphysicians to share their struggles if this issue is to beeffectively combatted. 1 Impostor syndrome can affect a veterinary career in important ways. It may prevent a veterinarian fromapplying to a job they are well-quali ed for or prevent them from marketing their abilities to clients, causinglowered earnings. Doctors may turn down job offers,refuse to see certain kinds of cases, or even decide toleave the position they have due to the stress theyfeel. Some practitioners with impostor syndromerefer cases quickly and before they have done thework up/treatment that they are capable of. When apromotion or partnership buy-in proposal arises, they may feel inadequate and turn down these offers. All of these situations lead to missed opportunities,including those of gaining experience and becomingrecognized as an \"expert \"by clients, colleagues, and perhaps most importantly, by themselves. Lower - nancial gain and lower professional status (alwaysthe associate, never the boss\u2014 and not by desire) even- tually may affect workplace morale, motivation, andhappiness. The end result may be a change ofcareers or simply burnout. When a person thinksabout being insecure or being a fraud, this stimulatesthe amygdala in the limbic system, which controlsmood and instincts. The amygdala then sends signalsto the regions of the frontal cortex that analyze andinterpret data, where the brain evaluates whether thisdata is accurate. If the data is perceived as concern-ing, the adrenal gland produces a release of epinephrine, bringing physiological stress. 7When partnered with the normal stresses of a veterinary career, impostorsyndrome-related stress can be a factor in negativephysical and mental health outcomes. Risk factorsfor developing impostor syndrome include new chal-lenges, such as an educational opportunity, new job, orcareer success. The person may feel undeserving ofthe new position or worried that they will be unable toperform adequately. Family environment can set aperson up for later dif culty \u2014ap e r s o ng r o w i n gu p alongside a \"gifted \"sibling may internalize feelings of inadequacy that are not justi ed. Conversely, a per- son who always found it easy to excel during child-hood may experience doubts when faced with atask that is hard to achieve later in life. Research also suggests that people from marginalized popu- lation groups may be more at risk, as well as thosethat have depression. The syndrome is commonin the high-stakes and evaluative culture ofmedicine. Overcoming the challenges of impostorsyndrome begins with self-awareness and under-standing its prevalence among high achievers. Inorder to achieve the goal of becoming a veterinar-ian, external validation in the form of excellentgrades and recommendations from establishedpractitioners was required. After entering prac-tice, one 's self-worth may be refl ected by the full- ness of the work schedule or the competitivesuccess of the horses one treats. \"If external sour- ces comprise the entirety of one 'ss e l f - w o r t h ,t h a ti s a precarious position to be in. However, the moreone's locus of self-worth is internal, the less one has to look to others for validation and the less sus-ceptible one is to impostor syndrome. \" 5 Working with a therapist can be helpful in alleviat- ing the condition of impostor syndrome. Cognitivebehavioral therapy (CBT), an evidence-based inter-vention commonly employed by mental health profes-sionals, has resulted in positive outcomes bydeconstructing pathologic belief systems and disman-tling negative behaviors. One particular exerciseIMPROVING YOUR PRACTICE, FINANCIAL, AND EMOTIONAL WELLBEING AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 277calls for generating mock responses from superiors such as: \"I did not give you an extra week of vacation because I think you are tired ...I rewarded you for your outstanding work, \"or\"Id o n 't like you negating my opinions about your work when I give you positivefeedback. '\"In this manner, CBT challenges the indi- vidual 's perceptions surrounding feedback and per- formance to bring about recognition of his or her trueabilities. Group therapy can be especially effective,as other participants 'negative self-perceptions can of- ten be clearly seen as unrealistic, prompting recogni-tion that their own feelings of inadequacy are notsubstantiated by reality either. 2Some veterinarians appear to be addicted to the validation that comesfrom working, not to the work itself. When a personbecomes more attuned to internal validation and ableto nurture their inner con dence that states that they are competent and skilled, it is much easier to feel howmuch work is reasonable. It is also important to internalize the idea that there is no shame in asking for help when needed, either to learn a new skill orwhen the workload is overwhelming. Mentoringinterns or younger colleagues, or volunteering, can be agreat way to discover strengths and become more com-fortable being in a position of expertise. When a per-son shares their knowledge, it not only bene ts others but also helps that person mitigate their fraudulentfeelings. To move past feelings of being an impostor,people must see themselves as a work in pro-gress. Lifelong learning and skill-building continuefor everyone, even the most con dent and learned people. If impossibly high standards are an obstacle,doctors must identify speci c, changeable behaviors that they can improve over time. It is much more pro-ductive to focus on honing speci c skills than to avoid performing certain types of services that causeanxiety. Individuals experiencing impostor syndromeoften perceive themselves as being the only one havingthese feelings, resulting in even greater isolation. Inhuman medicine, it is considered that \"referral to group therapy in which peers/coworkers discuss theirfeelings of doubt and failure might be particularlytherapeutic. Clinicians and other high-achieving pro-fessionals may be reluctant to participate in suchgroups unless they are carefully designed to normalizeand destigmatize impostor feelings and provide a safeenvironment in which to share experiences openly.\" 4 Networking groups of peers that provide a psychologi-cally safe environment can be instrumental in allowingprofessionals to see that they are not alone in thesestruggles. Young equine veterinarians are increas-ingly participating in groups of this nature. a For students and new graduates, it is important that they own their own success and expect to stretchas they gain con dence with their skills while remain- ing cognizant of when they need to ask forhelp. Veterinarians of all ages should know thatthey are not alone with impostor syndrome. Groupdiscussions can normalize feelings of impostor syn-drome and blunt their impact. Understanding thateveryone has feelings of inadequacy at times mayallow doctors to be kinder to themselves. By rede n- ing \"failures \"as\"learning opportunities\" , forgiving themselves for mistakes, and noticing all the impor- tant things they got right, practitioners can start toovercome their feelings of inadequacy. It can help toremember that \"Emotions aren 'tf a c t s , \"\"You can 't know everything, nobody does, \"and \"Asking for help or guidance does not mean you 've failed. \"Mentors can intentionally steer conversations in these directionsand repeat these phrases to reset mentees self-perceptions. Self-talk can be remarkably valua-ble. Questions that should be asked include the fol-lowing: What are my core strengths? Am I trying toimpress others with perfection? How much doesthe approval of others matter to me? Who am Ireally disappointing? And why? Additional recom-mendations include avoiding comparison to others,sharing feelings with colleagues, and seeking pro-fessional help if needed. Keeping a list of \"rsts \" or\"accomplishments \"for the year, such as new procedures, clinical skills, or diagnoses, can be con-dence building. Learning to accept compliments and stop crediting success to other factors can beaccomplished with the repeated deliberate practiceof simply saying \"Thank you \"in response. In mentor/mentee relationships, participants shouldcreate discussion with others about things theydo not know to help establish the \"I'mn o t alone \"feeling. Lastly, adopting a growth mindset can change outcomes. Carol Dweck, a psychologyresearcher, identi ed two different theories describing how malleable one 's personal character- istics (e.g., intelligence, musical ability, sociability)are. The rst is \"xed, \"a belief that one has a set amount of capacity in a given area, and it is notchangeable; that talent is the main contributor toone's success. The second is \"growth, \"ab e l i e f that hard work and dedication can lead to increased ability and capacity, with one' st a l e n t simply providing a foundation. Dweck 's research has shown that adopting a growth mindset improves resilience and willingness to persevere inthe face of failure. If people believe that they cangrow and change, then failure stops being a threatto their sense of self. This decreases the powerthat impostor syndrome has to create fear andparalysis. 8 In summary, knowledge is power. Understanding the broad prevalence of impostor syndrome among allages and genders, especially in high achieving profes-sionals, can assist veterinarians in diminishing itseffects. Adopting strategies for limiting the associatednegative thoughts and behaviors can help individualsbe more successful and satis ed in their careers.

In recent years, only about 1% of new grads enter equinemedicine and about half fail to renew their AAEP mem-bership within 5 years, which is an approximation ofthose leaving equine practice. 1T h er e a s o n sa r em u l t i - factorial, but nancial stress ranks highly, especially for those with high student loan debt. Many prospec-tive equine students are discouraged from entering theeld because the salary is much lower compared to s m a l la n i m a lm e d i c i n e . 2Little time is devoted to per- sonal nance in the formal curriculum. Most informa- tion is centered on the available loan repaymentplans. Unfortunately, choosing one of these repay-ment options does not create a comprehensive nancial plan, and without the right strategy, one may still faceuncertainty about which approach is the right one. Itis incumbent upon the individual to self-educate aboutpersonal nance, but it can be overwhelming to know where to start. The objective of this article is to pro-vide actionable advice on how to approach nances for a veterinary student or recent graduate, but any veteri-narian may nd this information useful. The articlewill cover strategies to maximize your savings rate,approach student loan repayment, and invest. Thecore tenet of wealth building is simple: spend less thanyou earn and invest the difference. 2. Solution Part I: Spend Less Than You Earn It may sound patronizing to start with such a simple instruction as spend less than you earn. The reasonthis article starts here is because there are only twoways to increase your wealth: spend less money orearn more money. Spending less is an attractivestarting place for several reasons: It can be imple-mented immediately without additional time or capi-tal investment, there are tax advantages due tomarginal taxation, it decreases the risk of beingunable to pay for the unexpected, and it decreases - nancial stress when expenses are kept undercontrol. Without intentional and optimized spending,money will flow out of your bank account and it is easy to fall victim to lifestyle creep. In lifestyle creep, dis-cretionary spending increases with higher income and NOTES 280 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSIMPROVING YOUR PRACTICE, FINANCIAL, AND EMOTIONAL WELLBEINGluxury items are falsely identi ed as necessities. The real danger of lifestyle creep is that as monthly expenses increase, you perpetuate the paycheck-to-pay- check cycle and the subsequent nancial stress leads to poor well-being and burnout. The Budget To avoid these pitfalls, a budget is needed. The author suggests a zero-based budgeting method like ynab.com (You Need a Budget), but the pro-cess is similar for most budgeting software orexcel spreadsheets. Step 1: Calculate annual or monthly income after taxes. This is your take-home pay. Step 2: List expenses by category. These include essentials (housing, transportation, loan payments,groceries, cell phone, insurance, clothing, child care, pet care, etc.) and non-essentials (dining out, spending money, gifts, vacation, entertainment, gym member-s h i p ,c h a r i t y ,e t c . ) .D o n 't forget non-recurring expenses like car registration, home/auto mainte- nance or medical bills. A great way to remember all of your expenses is to categorize each line item in yourbank or credit card statements and average them overseveral years. Step 3: For each category, divide the annual expense by 12 months. Fund these categoriesmonthly, even for line items that don 't recur each month like holiday spending. This helps prevent your budget from getting derailed by unexpected expenses. Step 4: Calculate the savings rate. This is your income minus expenses. Savings should be assigneda job to be sure your money is working toward your goals. Step 5: Analyze spending. Look for areas of over- spending or consistent underfunding. Eliminate spending that does not provide value (e.g., redun-dant subscription services or an unused gym membership). Step 6: Set realistic goals. Choose areas to improve spending habits or increase saving, but don 't give up after the rst slip up. Recognize and reward any progress made and forgive yourself or pastmistakes. When analyzing spending, it is likely to nd that the biggest recurring expenses are housing, transpor- tation, and groceries. For veterinarians, student loan debt may also rank high on that list. Another common realization is that there is nothing left tosave after the monthly obligations are met. You maybe living paycheck-to-paycheck with a zero percent or, in the case of consumer debt, negative savings rate. The Savings Rate The savings rate is your path to wealth and ultimately, retirement. Conventional wisdom recommends 10%of income be invested in retirement accounts to retire by age 65. This is a reasonable starting place, butretirement is not the only goal for which one needs to save. A larger savings rate is required to allow you to develop a reasonable emergency fund, save money for adown payment on a home, prepare for the potential tax bomb for individuals pursuing loan forgiveness, and contribute to a child' s college fund or leave money to charity. Growing the gap between spending and earn-ing is the single most powerful tool to eliminate nan- cial stress and build wealth. Consider the followingscenario in which Dr. A has a $60,000 income with a10% savings rate, Dr. B has a 20% savings rate, and D r .Ch a sa5 0 %s a v i n g sr a t e( F i g .1 ) . T h i sd e m o n - strates that after a 40-year working career (with noincrease in salary for simplicity), Dr. A has saved $240,000 dollars, Dr. B has saved $480,000, and Dr. C has saved $1.2 million. If this money is invested(more on this later), instead of kept in a savingsaccount, the earning potential is far greater, and its buying power will not be eroded by inflation. However, not every dollar has to be invested in the market to be bene cial. For many, having 3 -6 months of living expenses set aside can have tremendous psychologicalbenet. It will only take Dr. C 3 months to save 3 months of living expenses, compared to the 9 months it will take for Dr. A. These savings c a na l s ob ee a r m a r k e df o rah o u s ed o w np a y m e n t ,practice acquisition/start up or investment in real estate. Spend Less A key strategy to decrease spending is to pay yourself rst. This means, that with every paycheck, deposit a predetermined sum into a separate account before paying any other bills or making discretionary purchases. Common bills and expenses can be reduced through creativity and flexibility (Fig. 2). If one of the ideas below is intriguing, then dive in with more research. The more options you take advant- a g eo f ,t h ef a s t e ry o u r n ancial situation will improve. Student loans require some additionalthought, but the ner details of the available loan repayment options are beyond the scope of this article. If feeling out of your depth, consider using a Fig. 1. Comparison of savings rate for three doctors.IMPROVING YOUR PRACTICE, FINANCIAL, AND EMOTIONAL WELLBEING AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 281service like www.studentloanplanner.com for debt consultation. Generally speaking, if your salary is more than half of your loan burden, the total cost of the loan will be lowest if it is re nanced and paid back as aggressively as possible. If re nancing, any eligi- bility for loan forgiveness options provided to bor- rowers with federal student loans will be lost. Even if your debt-to-income ratio falls in the above category,you may still prefer an income-driven repayment program. The reasons for this may include your monthly payment remains much lower, you or yourpartner' s current job is not stable, legislation may change to allow partial or full loan forgiveness with or without tax forgiveness, the opportunity cost for pay- ing your loan aggressively interferes with plans tos a v ef o rah o m e ,s t a r taf a m i l yo ri n v e s te a r l i e r ,o rt h enancial stress of a large monthly student loan pay- ment is psychologically damaging. It may be equallyp s y c h o l o g i c a l l yd a m a g i n gf o rs o m et oh a v ea no u t -standing loan balance for decades, so aggressivepay down may be the best option for those individuals. At the end of the repayment period, any forgiven loan balance will be taxable income.Prepare for this tax bomb by investing a portion of income; the student loan calculator at www.vin.com is an excellent resource to estimate potential taxburden. In the potential case where the tax bomb iseliminated through future legislation, this money can be used elsewhere. If you choose not to pay loans aggressively, it may be comforting to know that highstudent loan debt will not disqualify you from buying ahome or nancing a practice purchase, assuming you have a good credit score and little consumer debt (i.e.,credit cards, car loan). Credit cards are notevil. When used responsibly, credit cards have many benets including sign up bonuses, cash back rewards, fraud protection, free credit score access, 30-day inter- est-free loan on all purchases, and a huge positiveimpact on one 's credit score. An effective budget will prevent overextending yourself on purchases madewith credit cards. Any current credit card debt should be paid off as the highest nancial priority. Earn More Cutting expenses is a key part of any nancial plan to prevent lifestyle creep and optimize spending. There is, however, an upper limit to how much can be saved:100% of your income. Conversely, there is no upper limit to how much can be earned. Even as an equine veterinarian, there are plenty of ways to increase takehome pay within and without the veterinary eld (Fig. 3). The potential for increasing your earning is linkedto your creativity and drive. It can be a powerful toolto grow the gap and increase investing potential. Part II: Invest the Difference Investing in the stock market is intimidating. It also carries risk. Fortunately, with a relatively brief edu- cation, even the least nancially-inclined veterinarian can utilize it successfully to build wealth. One of the best strategies to maximize long-term earning poten-tial is also simple and minimizes risk. Investment Strategy This strategy is to buy low-cost, broad-based index funds and hold them for decades. A broad-based index fund is comprised of hundreds or even thousandsof publicly traded companies. The S&P 500 containsthe top 500 largest companies in the United States,while a total stock market index fund contains nearlyall;3,000 publicly traded companies. Buying and holding index funds allows you to match the annualmarket returns because it essentially buys all of themarket. A conservative estimate of the stock marketreturn is 6 -8% based on historical averages, although this does not guarantee future market per-formance. A buy-and-hold strategy does not attempt to time when to enter and exit the market, it doesn 't rely on individual stock picking or day trading, and it doesn 't panic at market volatility. Hold on to these Fig. 2. Actionable tips to lower expenses. Fig. 3. Ideas to increase income.IMPROVING YOUR PRACTICE, FINANCIAL, AND EMOTIONAL WELLBEING 282 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSinvestments through high and low points in the market (they will come) because, since its inception, the mar- ket has continued to climb doggedly upward. To illus-trate the wealth building potential of the stock marketand the bene ts of compound interest, recall Drs. A, B, and C (Fig. 4). If these doctors invest every dollarsaved, the compound return on their investmentmakes each a millionaire. Dr. A invested only $500p e rm o n t h ,D r .B$ 1 , 0 0 0p e rm o n t h ,a n dD r .C$ 2 , 5 0 0per month. Investment Accounts Regardless of the investment strategy used, all stock purchases are made within investment accounts. Thegovernment allows tax-advantaged accounts for spe-cic uses such as retirement, health savings, or fund- ing college. A taxable brokerage account is aninvestment account without any of these taxadvantages. You may need to use a taxable accountafter reaching contribution limits for the tax-advan-taged accounts. Each type of account has access tosimilar funds, though may be limited by what is offeredin an employer retirement plan. Retirement plansfall into two broad categories: pre-tax and after-tax(Fig. 5). Pre-tax retirement accounts save on income tax in the year of the contribution, because they lower taxable income. For example, if your salary is$90,000 and you contribute $10,000 to a pre-tax retire-ment account, you will only pay taxes on the remaining$80,000 and avoid the 24% tax bracket that wouldhave applied to income >$86,375. Withdrawals madein retirement are subject to income tax. Examples ofthese accounts include the 401(k) and the traditional IRA, as well as self-employed accounts like the i401(k), solo 401(k), and SEP IRA. The 401(k) is typically setu pt h r o u g ha ne m p l o y e r ,o f t e nw i t hac o n t r i b u t i o n match up to a salary percentage. Always take full advantage of an employer match as this is tax-free income and does not count against your contribution limit. After-tax retirement accounts are taxed the year of contribution but can be withdrawn tax-free in retirement. These accounts are especially advanta- g e o u sw h e ni n c o m et a x e sa r el o wd u et oal o w e r salary. Examples of these accounts include the Roth IRA and Roth 401(k). Another advantage of a Roth IRA is the ability to withdraw contributions tax- and penalty-free at any time (because this money has al- r e a d yb e e nt a x e d ) . T h i sm a ym a k ei ta na t t r a c t i v e account to keep a savings or emergency fund. It will be making more money than in a bank account (stand- ard savings account typically pay something like 0.01% return and even high-yield savings accounts are only paying 0.5% return at the time of writing), but inves- ting this money in the market is riskier than using anFDIC insured bank account. Be aware that contribu- tion limits for after-tax accounts are lower than pre-tax accounts. One additional tax-advantaged account is worth noting here, the Health Savings Account (HSA). To qualify for this account, at least one family member must be enrolled in a qualifying high deducti- ble insurance plan (most of these plans will have HSA in the name). An HSA allows tax-free contributions, tax-free growth, and tax-free withdrawals. With- drawals can be made at any time to reimburse medical expenses even for family members not in a qualifying plan. You can choose to reimburse yourself decades later if you pay out of pocket initially. This makes the HSA an incredibly powerful wealth building tool. To get started with investing, choose a company and create an account. Many companies exist, but Fig. 4. The wealth building potential of the stock market and compound interest. *Assumptions: $0 initial investment, xed monthly contribution, annual return of 8%. Fig. 5. Comparison of several tax-advantaged accounts for 2021.IMPROVING YOUR PRACTICE, FINANCIAL, AND EMOTIONAL WELLBEING AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 283Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab are all great options. After verifying your information, set up abank transfer to fund the settlement account. This is a holding place for your money before making a purchase. Index Funds Each brokerage company will have access to similar stocks, but recall that low-cost, broad-based index fund investing is one of the best options. (If you de- velop a keen interest in investing, you may prefer to diversify your portfolio beyond index funds.) Let 's explore the advantages of index funds further. First, they conveniently let you buy hundreds of highly suc- cessful companies in a single transaction. Second,they are self-cleansing. This means that companies that perform poorly and go out of business, with returns falling to 0%, will be removed from thefund. Conversely, a successful company can have returns of 100%, 200%, 1000% or more. Third, when purchasing U.S. index funds, you will get interna- tional exposure, since many are international businesses. Finally, and this point cannot be over-stated, they are inexpensive to buy or \"low cost. \"Speci cally, they have low expense ratios. An expense ratio is the fee to buy any stock, based onoperating costs. Low fees are so important because they cut into returns. Dr. B from the previous exam- ple is considering two different funds to invest in, the rst has a 0.4% expense ratio which seems low, but the second has 0.04% expense ratio. The difference after 40 years of investing is over $275,000 (Fig. 6). Put another way, with $1,000,000 at a 0.04% expense ratio, $400 are lost to fees annually. At0.4%, that number increases to $4,000. If using a - nancial planner or other actively managed fund witha 2% fee for assets under management on top of this expense ratio, $20,400 is lost to fees annually. If you still aren 't convinced about index funds, consider Warren Buffet 's recommendations to the trustee of his estate: \"My advice to the trustee couldn't be more simple: Put 10% of the cash in short-term governmentbonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&P 500 index fund. (I suggest Vanguard's.) I believe the trust's long- term results from this policy will be superior to thoseattained by most investors \u2014whether pension funds,institutions or individuals \u2014who employ high-fee managers. \" 3 A l ls t o c k sa n df u n d sh a v eat i c k e rs y m b o l ,w h i c hi s used to search when buying. You can do a Google search for each company 's funds: \"Vanguard S&P 500\" is VOO, \"Vanguard total stock market fund \"is VTSMX or VTSAX. Although similar funds, VTSAX has a lower expense ratio (0.04% compared to 0.14% for VTSMX) but requires a $3,000 minimum investment. If that seems unattainable right now and you want to start getting money into the market sooner, choose \"Vanguard total stock market ETF \", VTI (expense ratio of 0.03%), which can be purchased as individual shares (trading at $207.40 at the time of writing). Similar mutual funds and ETFs are avail- able from Fidelity and Charles Schwab (Fig. 7). Buy i n d e xf u n d so f f e r e db yt h eb r o k e r a g ew i t hw h o my o u invest to avoid transaction fees. Bonds With stocks, you are buying part ownership of a com- pany; the risk is higher, so the returns are higher (;8-10%). With bonds, you are loaning money to a company (or the government, in the case of Mr.Buffet 's short-term government bonds). Here, the risk is lower, so the return is lower ( ;4-6%). Wealth building potential is much higher with stocks, butbonds are less volatile. The main bene to fb o n d si n a portfolio is to smooth the ride and help you sleep at night if your risk tolerance is lower. Risk tolerance is highly individual, so no single proportion of stocks/ bonds is right for everyone. To provide a framework, 100% stocks are appropriate during the early decadesof your working career, and as you near retirement, you can increase your bond exposure, landing some- where near 75% stocks to 25% bonds. For bonds, you can also buy a total bond market index fund (e.g., VTBMX). To avoid the need to rebalance your portfolio as you age, you can buy a Target Retirement Fund (e.g.,\"Vanguard Target Retirement 2055 Fund \"which assumes you want to retire in Year 2055). This will automatically increase your bond exposure as you get closer to your retirement year, but the expense ratio is higher (0.15%). Fig. 6. The cost of expense ratios. Fig. 7.

Results and Discussion Nonancial plan is immune to life circumstances or setbacks. These events are predictable in their unpredictability. The stock market has had longstretches of plummeting returns, which can rattle themost resolute investor. The worst response is to sellat the bottom, only to watch it inevitably climb beyondthe prerecession peak. The equine veterinary profes-sion is also experiencing very real challenges. Thecurrent decline of new equine graduates and attritionrate threatens our ability to adequately care forpatients if the trend continues. The strategies dis-cussed in this article provide groundwork to addresssome of the nancial stress associated with this career and help equine practitioners thrive and contribute tothe rebound of our profession.

Grice, VMD, MBA With fewer new graduates choosing a career in equine medicine (less than 2% for the last decade) and signi cant numbers of equine veterinarians transitioning to other sectors or retiring each year, many practices are struggling to ll openings for associates. New paradigms of equine practice are needed to change these trends. Finding our way forward as an industry will require innovative ideas,flexibility, family-friendly cultures, shorter work weeks, better boundaries, capturing all revenue, improved ef ciency, and higher fees. In addition, improved internships, collaborative emergency serv- ices, better support and mentoring for new graduates, client education, and competitive salaries will beneeded. Fostering connection, minimizing injury, and modifying restrictive covenants are also impor- tant. Together, we can build a better, more satisfying life for equine practitioners.

According to AVMA statistics, equine veteri-narians are a small fraction (5.6%) of the total number of private practice veterinarians, representing 4,151 of 74,554.1Females have become the majority, compris- ing 55.5% of equine veterinarians. Veterinary stu-dents are now 85% female as an average. In the membership of the AAEP, 44% are over the age of 50 years, of which 17.4% are 51 -60 years, and 26.6% are greater than 60 years of age.aThe AVMA esti- mates that there will be about 60 equine DVM retire-ments per year, growing 3% per year. According 2016 AVMA AAEP Economic Impact Study, 52.8% of equine practices have two or fewer full-time equiva- lent veterinarians, whereas just 20.6% have sixor more. 2With these demographic changes come challenges. One of the most stressful and alienating aspects of equine practice is the need to provide emer- gency care 24/7/365. The 2012 AAEP Owner TrainerSurvey showed that one of clients 'top priorities in choosing a veterinarian is the availability of on-the- farm emergency care.3This need contributes to high attrition in the eld, perhaps because new female entrants often have more family responsibilities leadingto more dif culty in providing after hours care. In the last 20 years, about 50% of new graduates that wereAAEP members have let their membership lapsewithin ve years of graduation. The number of new graduates entering equine practice has also beendecreasing. From a high of 5.7% in 2003, this numberfell to 1.0% in 2019 before rising to 1.4% in2020. 4There is currently a shortage of veterinarians toll available jobs in all sectors. Sixty-six percent of job postings have 0 applicants, according to AVMA gures.5The companion animal job to applicant ratio is 0.0 -0.5 for more than 50% of states. Salaries, work hours, and emergency service requirements are more attractive to many young graduates in the companionanimal sector than the equine sector. Both NOTES 286 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSIMPROVING YOUR PRACTICE, FINANCIAL, AND EMOTIONAL WELLBEINGunemployment (0.8%) are cur- rently very low for veterinarians.5Veterinary employ- ment is projected to grow 19% percent from 2016 to2026, much faster than the average for otheroccupations. 6Geographic maldistribution is likely to remain a problem in the profession, which could leavesome areas underserved. As the U.S. populationincreases, pet ownership % forecast to remain stable, sodemand for veterinarians will continue to increase.However, pet horse population numbers have fallen61% in the last 5 years, according to the 2017 -2018 AVMA Pet Owner Demographic Survey. 7These sta- tistics illustrate some of the factors in the recent dif - culties in attracting and retaining equine veterinariansin equine practice. A recent study indicated thatequine veterinarians leave equine practice primarily due to lifestyle and number of work hours required, emergency on-call duty, and mental health andstress. 8New paradigms are necessary to mitigate these factors. 2. Discussion Innovative thinking is necessary to relieve the pain points that equine veterinarians experience. Embracing necessary change requires flexibility and the willingness to try things that may be out-side of one' sc o m f o r tz o n e . Family-Friendly Culture When young women attend college followed by veteri- nary school in the usual temporal fashion, they gradu- ate with their DVM/VMD at the age of 28. Biologicalimperatives imply that starting a family (if this iswhat they desire) will be most successful if under-taken within the next several years. Within human medicine, a geriatric pregnancy is one that occurs any- time a woman is over the age of 35. Unfortunately,this timing coincides with the important rst years of an e wg r a d u a t e 's career. Owners of equine practices often must invest pro t for a year or so to augment an e wh i r e 's salary until they grow their gross rev- enue production suf ciently to support their compensation. If a new hire fails to build a clientbase quickly enough, pro tability of the practice suffers. Practicing while pregnant can be dan-gerous, and women may wish to avoid some oftheir usual duties. 9Disability of pregnancy and delivery must be treated like any other disabilityand, when uncomplicated, lasts 6- 8 weeks. Some w o m e nd e s i r et ot a k ea d d i t i o n a lm a t e r n i t yl e a v eor prefer to return to work on a reduced scheduleinitially. All of these factors can create short-termchallenges at a practice, but good communication,flexibility, and genuine caring can increase loyalty and job satisfaction. Thinking through and having a col-laborative plan in place in advance for maternity leavesis smart business. The alternative is often losing tal-ented associates permanently. Veterinarians withyoung families generally cannot work long hours eachday, 6 -7 days per week, as has traditionally been the norm in equine practice. Having a \"hard stop \"to the day is often necessary to allow children to be picked up at daycare or from after school activities. Household necessities such as grocery shopping and doctors ' appointments must be attended to. Many female veterinarians are married, with spouses that are employed full time and often not available for these responsibilities. Many of these young families do nothave relatives living nearby to provide help for theseneeds. Practices that offer shortened work-days and work weeks will attract and retain associates more successfully. A 4-day work week with no routineappointments scheduled to begin past 3 or 4 p.m. canhelp provide the time that current associates need. To cover the needs of the practice, more veteri- narians may be required, ef ciency must be improved, or other steps must be taken. Boundaries The Gallup 's State of the American Workplace poll in 2017 revealed that 53% of employees say that a greaterwork-life balance is \"very important \"to them.10 Workplace boundaries can help veterinarians achieveand safeguard work-life balance and physical as well asmental health. These limits may have to do with howmuch or what kind of work a veterinarian is willing or not willing to take on (e.g., Will that doctor collect stal- lions or obtain spinal fluid in the eld?) or what kinds of relationships they are willing or not willing to estab-lish with colleagues and clients from work. Creating boundaries in practice can be tricky because there is the real worry of being red by clients or receiving neg- ative feedback from colleagues or an employer. Yet with clear communication, practice, and preparation, it can be done successfully. It is generally easier to setboundaries when rst starting a job or a practice. \"Start as you intend to continue \"is good advice. It is much harder to change in midstream. When a personbelieves in the validity of their own personal bounda-ries, others typically will, too. The adage \"you teach what you tolerate\" is a true statement. There are three major types of work boundaries: \u0081Physical boundaries refer to the rules that dene personal space and touch (e.g., hugs vs. handshakes) in the workplace. \u0081Emotional boundaries may cause a doctor to decline certain tasks at work (e.g., euthanizing a young healthy horse), and this type of barrierwill not allow others 'attitudes to have in flu- ence, because it is seated in personal values. \u0081Mental boundaries refer to thoughts on matters in the workplace. For example, an opinion on theethics of certain behaviors at work will not beswayed by someone else's ideas of how things should go. When considering and de ning boundaries for an equine practice, it is important to consider theIMPROVING YOUR PRACTICE, FINANCIAL, AND EMOTIONAL WELLBEING AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 287number of hours each veterinarian should plan to work; under what circumstances and conditions they will need to work after-hours; how they will be referred to by clients and staff, and to which clients, ifany, they will give their cell phone number. Settingboundaries for the practice will protect team membersfrom burning out and/or nding themselves in uncom- fortable situations that could have been otherwiseavoidable. Setting boundaries is important becausewithout them practice members will likely start tofeel undervalued, underappreciated, disrespected, orworse. Examples of workplace boundaries couldinclude the following: \u0081Expecting to be called Doctor Last Name by col- leagues, clients, and staff; \u0081Saying no to scheduling routine appointments on the weekends; \u0081Decreasing availability by teaching clients notto expect team members to continue to checkemails, texts, and answer nonemergency com- munication after work hours; \u0081Not answering nonemergency emails, calls, and texts after hours; \u0081Saying no to opportunities that, although entic-ing monetarily, or because they would enhancestatus, do not suit lifestyle needs; \u0081Utilizing paid time off when sick, needing amental health day, having a funeral to attend,or wanting to take a vacation or go to a horseshow; \u0081Turning down tasks that are not within thepractice 's current professional capabilities; and \u0081Staying professional with colleagues, even if some of them are unlikable. Dr. Erin Denney-Jones, AAEP Board member and solo practitioner in Florida, stated, \"Better boundaries are needed to decrease burnout. When clients en- courage veterinarians to become a 'member of the family ', this makes boundaries much more dif cult. 'Family 'tend to expect discounts, which can lead to disappointment and feelings of betrayal when theseclients move on to a new veterinarian. \"In addition, moving away from being addressed as \"Doctor\" leads to disrespect, and always being available and givingfull access to clients downplays the respected role of aveterinarian. Dr. Denney-Jones added, \"Does your physician give you their personal cell phone number?Do you call them with routine questions on Sundayevening? \"To improve boundaries, Dr. Denney-Jones carries two cell phones, one personal, and oneprofessional. Capturing Revenue Not capturing all the revenue for the work done can have a marked effect on practice nancial health. Failing to account for all services and dis- pensed supplies on invoices is common. Discountingis widespread. When all the revenue earned is not invoiced and received to offset expenses, the funds n e e d e dt op a yc o m p e t i t i v es a l a r i e sm a ys i m p l yn o tb ethere. All discounting is not bad, but much of it is. Planned discounting that incentivizes behaviors thatflatten out the seasonality of equine practice is much different from reactionary discounting. When bills are reduced for clients who complain or harangue or threaten, morale falls. The \"good \"clients that are grateful for the service pay full price withoutdiscussion. The unfairness of rewarding bad behav- ior affects everyone working in the practice. Special d e a l sa r ea l s os o m e t i m e sm a d ew i t hc l i e n t sw h oa r efriends, or who insinuate that their veterinarian is\"like family. \"Disharmony can result among part- ners when pro t leaks away from this type of behavior. Clients begin to perceive that fees arenegotiable. When an associate charges the \"list\"price, and the practice owner gives a discount, the negative possibilities multiply. Discounts bleed away pro t, leaving less money for compensation. Forming clearpractice nancial policies and then abiding by them h a st h ep o w e rt oi n c r e a s ec l i e n t s 'and associates ' respect for the profession and the practice. Efficiency Equine ambulatory practice generally involves manyhours driving from client to client, or farm tofarm. This is not billable time, and as service pro-viders, veterinarians have only their time to sell. Utilization of an assistant can make these hours more efcient. If the employee is the driver, the veterinar- ian can be preparing laboratory submission forms, nalizing invoices, looking up history for the next call, scheduling appointments, or making callbacks. If the doctor prefers to drive, a well-trained assistantcan accomplish most of these tasks. For those doc- tors that are solo in the truck, driving time can pivot to personal time by visiting on the phone with friendsor family, or listening to a favorite podcast. When driving time is productive, the workday shortens because there is less to do at the end of theday. Scheduling calls in geographically segmented areas on an unvarying routine basis (e.g., north on Tuesday, south on Thursday) allows less driving time,and sets expectations for clients as to when you will be in their region. For this to work best, Dr. Jim Zeliff, AAEP Board member and managing partner ofAllegheny Equine, suggests having a \"float doctor \"to do daytime emergencies each weekday in a multi-doc- tor practice. By helping to keep the other doctors on schedule, they can n i s ha tt h et i m et h e y anticipated. When doctors stop operating as silos, share the work, and limit the length of days by not scheduling any routine calls after 3 or 4 p.m., sched-uled workdays can have a \"hard stop \"when the doctor is not on emergency duty. This allows veterinarianswith young children to pick them up at daycare orfrom school at a predetermined time and createsspace for life outside of practice. In some areas of the country, trailer ownership is common, and haul-inIMPROVING YOUR PRACTICE, FINANCIAL, AND EMOTIONAL WELLBEING 288 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSfacilities are the rule rather than the exception. This can markedly increase ef ciency and productivity, but the facility must be utilized regularly to offset the additional costs involved in maintaining a physical building. In areas where ambulatory service at the farm is the cultural expectation, re-training of clientsto a haul-in model should focus on the bene ts that out-patient appointments at a central location willbring to them. This may involve less cost for haul-inappointments than for farm visits (by raising farm tripfees), access to more specialized equipment, more com- fortable temperature-controlled surroundings, and other advantages. Providing emergency servicelimited to haul-in can be less onerous for equine vet- erinarians, as they can work in a well-lit, heated space with their supplies and equipment close athand, and no driving time. Dr. Erica Lacher, a prac- tice owner from Gainesville, Florida, has recently taken a different approach to emergency service byoffering coverage to other veterinarians in the area. In order to increase ef ciency, the practice is moving to a model where horses come to the veteri- narian rather than the veterinarian to the horses.This model requires training clients to purchase a trailer or develop a transportation plan before an emergency occurs. Fee Increases Salaries in the equine veterinary eld are substan- tially less than in the companion animal sector. Part of the reason for this difference is the inherent ef - ciency of having small animal patients booked in a central facility every 15 -20 min and use of veterinary technicians for many tasks. To have compensationincrease for equine practitioners, gross revenue pro-duction must increase. This could occur throughworking more hours, performing services with higher yields, or charging more robust fees. As equine vet- erinarians that are leaving equine practice cite longwork hours as a primary factor, working more hours is not a solution. Concentrating services in an area of high value can result in higher wages, but theseopportunities are not available to all equine doctors. General practice is still the most prevalent practice type, and most horses primarily need well-ness and low-level acute care, rather than high-level diagnostics or surgery. As a consequence, higher sal- aries will need to come at least in part from feeincreases. As equine veterinarians become morescarce (decreased supply) and the number of horses remains stable (stable demand), this will put increased upward pressure on prices. To have serv-ice, horse owners will have to pay higher fees. When one considers the cost of having an appliance repair person come to the house to repair a stove, suddenlythe prices of the professionally educated doctor do not seem so high. Dr. Zeliff of Allegheny Equine remarked, \"Most equines are no longer herd ani- mals \u2014they are pets, not livestock, so every horse should get a physical exam with vaccines. Fees need to increase. Equine veterinarians should bea b l et oe a r ng r o s sr e v e n u es u f cient to support a $100,000 salary in a 4-day work week. This willrequire educating clients, collecting fees at the time of service, and minimizing accounts receivable. \" Internships As the numbers of veterinary students with an equine interest have diminished, opportunities for learning basic skills have also been depleted. With an increase in private referral hospitals across the United States, many universities now see mostly complicated cases that are not representative of general practice. Students must work hard tond circumstances where they can develop the ba- sic skills that are essential for an entry-level equineveterinarian. Many employers do not have the time or temperament to mentor a new graduate this intensely. In addition, clients 'expectations have become increasingly sophisticated. Well-constructed internships may offer the best way for new graduates to acquire the skills they need for a successful career in equine practice. Unfortunately, some practices that offer internships have a business model that uti-lizes interns as low-paid technicians and provides lit- tle formal skill acquisition and mentoring in return. For internships to be the bridge to a great career in equine practice, there must be a mutually benecial exchange where the practice takes pride in the mentoring relationship and the intern emerges with the skillset and con dence of a much more expe- rienced practitioner. Systems must emerge thatrank internships by their success in keeping equine interns in equine practice. Students must begin toseek internships in practices that will best position them for the career they want, not choose simply on the basis of name recognition or size. Seeking externships at smaller practices with internship pro- grams may reveal better learning opportunities forgeneral practice skills. Practices should consider offering weekly case rounds, journal club, and radiol- ogy rounds for all doctors to attend. Mentoring interns is a two-way interaction, as the newest techni- ques and medication uses at universities can belearned from new graduates. The objective must be am u t u a l l yb e n e cial arrangement, where interns receive as much in mentoring, skill acquisition, andexperience as they give in time, money (in the form of reduced salary) and effort. Emergency Service Another primary reason for the exodus of equine vet- erinarians from the eld is the burden of emergency duty. Being on call to attend emergencies can bestressful and exhausting, especially for small or solo practices. With more than half of equinepractices having two doctors or less, it is not uncommon for equine veterinarians to be on call 50-100% of the time. After the arrival of chil- dren, this increasingly can become untenable forfemale veterinarians. Among larger ambulatoryIMPROVING YOUR PRACTICE, FINANCIAL, AND EMOTIONAL WELLBEING AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 289practices that do not share emergency duty with other practices, the increased radii of service and high numbers of clients often lead to very busyon-call shifts, even when those shifts are reduced in number. Another not uncommon situation in larger practices is the inequitable sharing ofemergency duty, with owners opting out entirely, or doing minimal shifts. Other negatives associ- ated with emergency duty include not receiving addi-tional compensation for emergencies, not havingcontrol over last-minute coverage changes, and being scheduled for excessive shifts compared to veterinar- ians with more seniority. Emergency cooperativesare increasingly lling the need for minimal sched- uled days of emergency coverage, with small practicesin a region banding together to share the responsibil-ity of urgent care. Veterinarians of more recent gen- erations seem to nd the collaboration, cooperation, and comradery a positive addition to their lives, with minimal competitive drives. Doctors in these cooper- atives have covered periods of maternity leave for each other, as well as stepped up when a colleague isill or injured. Those that meet regularly also providea tribe that can add a sense of belonging. Changes that can help mitigate the negatives of emergency duty include paying 100% of any collected emergencyfee to the attending doctor, creating an equitable schedule on a quarterly, half-year, or annual basis that rotates in a regular pattern, rotating holidaysequitably, and joining an emergency cooperative if one exists in your region. Charging robust emer- gency fees, refusing emergency service to nonclients,and giving a compensatory day off in the week follow-ing a weekend on emergency call are additional ways to sweeten the taste of emergency service. Dr. Michelle Egli of Delmarva Equine in Dover,Delaware, heads a corporately owned practice of four equine veterinarians, working a rotating four-day week out of three trucks. The rotating on-call sched-ule is shared with two local solo practitioners, with at o t a lo f ve doctors in the rotation. Each veteri- narian has a rotating weekday (Monday -Friday) on call each week, and works on call one weekend(Saturday and Sunday) in ve. \"When you 're off, you're off \", said Dr. Egli. The practice cell phone is left at the practice on days off. The clients are bonded to the practice, not to a particular veterinarian, although each veterinarian sees certain clients routinely. The practice does a lot of reproductivework, and this too is shared among whichever veteri- narians are working that day. These changes to tradi- tional equine work life can allow associates to be muchhappier in their work. Mentoring and Support to Reduce Burnout In many long-established equine practices, theu n w r i t t e nr u l ei st ow o r ka sm u c ha sp o s s i b l e ,a l w a y sseeking to grow the practice by saying \"yes\"to all cli- ent requests as the default expectation. If an associ-ate pushes back against this culture, they are sometimes told without words that \"you don 't deserveto be here. \"Young veterinarians can burn out from never saying \"no.\"The culture at some practices to never say \"no\"is most often intended to increase reve- nue and business growth. Young equine veterinar- ians are generally full of grit and determination, and they usually look up to the senior doctors as icons andseek their approval. Because of their work ethic, they will usually soldier on until one day they may simply nd they are exhausted, depressed, and have nothing left to give. Although sometimes the advice given for overcoming burnout is to become more involved in outside activities, or giving back by volun-teering, this really means doing even more! \"Just do more \"may not be the answer. With the gender shift in the profession, the majority of equine veterinariansare women. The responsibilities of family, children, and household often are theirs, layered on top of their career responsibilities. Keeping these talented doc-tors in equine practice often requires them saying \"no\" more often and doing less rather than more. Moving to a 4-day work week with shared emergency duty is a rst step in reducing the stress that leads to burnout. Having the practice leaders (those senior doctors that the younger doctors respect and seek to please) model the way is important in building realchange in the practice culture. Showing support for associates 'needs can help keep them in the profession. Humans are hard-wired to \"belong,\" and when veterinarians 'needs confl ict with belonging to the traditional equine veterinary culture, they suffer. Culture change is imperative. Re-Educate Clients Increasing horse owner regard for the value of equine veterinarians is needed. The use of rst names, the liberal sharing of personal cell numbers, and the 24/7/ 365 availability without boundaries has eroded someclients 'respect for equine veterinarians. Lay practi- tioners are frequently consulted by many owners,despite a lack of credentials. Veterinarians ofteninhabit a culture of scarcity, anxious that if they charge appropriate prices or erect professional boun- daries their clients will abandon them. As one veter-inarian stated, We need to create a culture where equine veterinarians are respected. Bills need to be collected, on time and infull. Clients need to set up appointments to have medical questions answered. Veterinarians need to stop allowing clients to dictate their medicine. And they need to dealwith their fear of losing clients. A bad client that doesn 't pay you is worse than not servicing that client atall. There are clinics out there that have a statement writ-ten in contracts that allows them to not pay the associate if money has not been collected from the clients. But then they allow clients to avoid payment and don 'ta l l o wa s s o c i - ates to refuse service or re those clients. So who gets pun- ished here? Changing the expectations of clients will require ongoing education. The value of an equine veterinar- ian has been eroded by many factors. Striving for aIMPROVING YOUR PRACTICE, FINANCIAL, AND EMOTIONAL WELLBEING 290 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGShigh degree of professionalism, having appropriate boundaries, providing a high value for a fair and ro- bust fee, providing compassionate care and honestcommunication, and adhering to strong ethical and moral values can elevate our profession to its former position over time. Compensation With educational debt at higher levels than ever, theaverage debt to income ratio (DIR) of equine veteri- narians in the last decade is more than twice what is considered reasonable. Equine-oriented studentshave less debt than other students at the time of grad-uation, but the substantially lower entry level salaries create this untenable ratio. 11Although about 70% of new equine veterinarians have educational debt, they persist in following their dream of being equine practi- tioners despite the challenges. New models of com- pensation are necessary to keep them in the equinesector. With the passage of the CARES Act in 2020, employers were given the opportunity to pay educa- tional debt of employees as a nontaxable bene t directly to the lender up to the amount of $5,250 through 2024.12This is a deductible expense for the practice and is a good additional compensation to con- sider for every associate with student loans. Withequine jobs far exceeding applicants, starting salaries have increased. The total acceptable cost of employ- ing an associate equine veterinarian, including salary,benets, payroll taxes, licenses, memberships, and continuing education, has risen from 25% to 30%of their gross revenue production. 13This means that practices are lowering their practice pro ts by investing in increased salaries to compete for as-sociates. This will likely be followed by fee increasesover time. However, new models are essential innavigating this challenge. One innovative model takes the approach that it is a veterinary team that produces results, so the team doctors should sharethe commission on shared revenue. If a less expe- rienced associate can stay busy with health mainte- nance, general practice and cover daytimeemergencies, allowing a more experienced doctor to concentrate on more lucrative specialty work, per- haps the combined gross revenue is apportioned tothe team, rather than the individual. By creating learning opportunities for the newer doctor to ac- quire more skills with each year that enhance reve-nue production, the rising tide then raises bothboats. This approach can be extended to the entire practice team, with a certain percentage of the practice pro tb e i n gs e ta s i d et os h a r ew i t h them. Each employee could have three measura- ble, attainable annual goals. If, at their annual review, they achieved all three, they would receive100% of their piece of the pro t. If they achieved just two, they would receive 70%. If only one, theirreward would be 30% of their possible totalshare. When the practice owner shares ideas ofwhere pro t leaks from the practice (missed charges, discounts, improperly priced invoices,etc.), employees typically apply diligence to corrections. The nancial results of these efforts may more than compensate for the pro t sharing. Another action to take in increasing com-pensation for younger equine veterinarians is in facili- tating practice ownership. Increasing numbers of young equine practitioners are leaving associate posi-tions to open their own practices. This often increases their income substantially. With increased choice and control, the ability to set boundaries accord- ing to their own values and needs, and experiencing collaborative emergency coverage, many young veteri-narians nd this path to be much more rewarding than being an employee. If established practiceswish to keep young doctors, they may need to offer them the opportunity to buy a meaningful share of the practice fairly early in their tenure. A token 5% isunlikely to have the desired effect, as the associate typically understands that the gesture is simply to lock them in place at the practice. Veterinarians interested in practice ownership want decision-making capability, increased income, and the ability to shapethe practice in new ways. When ownership is held out as a possibility and then repeatedly postponed, offered as a tiny percentage, or the practice is then sold to a corporate entity, bitterness and departure is often the result. Connection With many newer graduates experiencing different pressures than their employers did when they were new to practice, young equine veterinarians often yearn for connection with their peers. Mental health concerns due to feeling overwhelmed by the competingdemands of practice and family may exacerbate these stressors. As achievers, veterinarians are often per- fectionists, and may nd they cannot perform per- fectly in all or any of the areas of their life, leading todistress. Mentoring by older, more experienced prac-titioners can be helpful for career advice, dif cult cases, and interpersonal dif culties with coworkers or clients, but networking with others of their cohort has value in helping them feel they are not isolated or alone in their struggles. Mentors are availablethrough the AAEP Outrider Mentoring program, 14 and networking through groups such as DecadeOne.15Extending these types of connection to veteri- nary students interested in equine practice may helpto support their retention. Physical Demands Equine practice is physically demanding and dangerous. The British Equine Veterinary Associa- tion reported, following their study in 2014, that being a horse vet in the United Kingdom appeared to carry the highest risk of injury of any civilian occu-pation in the United Kingdom.16Some young vet- erinarians may feel pressure from their employersnot to ever refuse to work on a horse, may feel guilty if they feel fear, and may get into dangerous situations as a result. Associates need toIMPROVING YOUR PRACTICE, FINANCIAL, AND EMOTIONAL WELLBEING AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 291advocate for themselves and make their safety a priority. Because about 40% of equine practitionersare in solo practice, unless they return to work swiftly after injury they risk losing clients and essential income. Returning to work against medical advice iscurrently the norm among equine practitioners andmay be a cultural imperative at some practices. Todecrease both acute and chronic injuries, practicesshould foster safe work practices, utilizing veterinaryassistants or technicians whenever possible, using andadvocating for adequate sedation and restraint, and notsetting a bad example by allowing doctors to continueworking with fractured limbs or with a headinjury. Personal protective equipment should be avail-able (e.g., helmets and vests in recovery or collectingstallions) and its use encouraged or mandated. Restrictive Covenants New graduates entering equine practice are over-whelmingly female. Many are married, and theirspouses relocate and take positions where their veteri-narian wives are working, or vice versa. With twocareers to manage, excessive noncompete clauses inan employment contract can contribute to veterinar-ians leaving the equine sector in order to avoid theneed for relocation. Corporate practices often havethe resources to litigate even minimal breaches of re-strictive covenants. Litigation is very expensive \u2014 even getting a declaratory judgment from a judge torule if the noncompete as written is valid or not validcan be beyond most young doctors 'means. This can trap an equine veterinarian at a practice where theyare unhappy if they want to continue treatinghorses. Frank Muggia, an attorney specializing inveterinary practices, feels that keeping equine associ-ates productive and happy is more successful inretaining staff than an onerous noncompete clause.Although many states have abolished noncompetes,as a protection that is not typically available in themarketplace, if a practice is in a state allowed to haveone, it will be more defensible if it names speci cb a r n s or current clients than a mileage radius. Timeframes longer than 6 months may be dismissed, as thejudge is likely to determine that reestablishing good-will should take no longer than that. bJob seekers should be careful to negotiate restrictive covenantswith their future in mind, and not sign those that theycould not keep without leaving their chosen career. 3. Conclusion If our profession is to prosper in the future, wemust attract and retain dedicated equine veteri-narians. New paradigms must evolve that allow ourchanging workforce to have the flexibility and support that they need while still keeping practices nancially healthy. We must all contribute to bringing aboutthe changes that will keep the equine veterinaryindustry viable for the future.Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of Veterinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Author 's address: AVMA, PLIT, AAEP. 1. Introduction The most common and costly equine malpractice com- plaints observed by the largest veterinary malpracticeprogram involve buyer complaints related to pre-purchase examinations (PPEs). PPE claims aremuch more likely to go into a suit faster than the other types of equine malpractice claims. In addi- tion, the indemnity provided in PPE settled claimsand plaintiff verdicts have higher costs than most ofthe other types of equine claims and lawsuits. 1The majority of the claims involve performance horses,particularly of the Hunter/Jumper, Dressage, andWestern disciplines and the complaints are relatedmostly to undisclosed radiographic abnormalities. 2 Other complaints have been associated with missedheart murmurs, missed ophthalmic disease, missedsurgical scars, and failure to recommend genetictesting. Certain drivers have been identi ed. Ana- lysis of past claims shows that a majority of the PPEclosed claims deal with lameness issues after thesale. A small percentage of the PPE allegations arerelated to cardiac, ophthalmic, and other uncommonabnormalities. 1After years of collecting data fromPPE claims, the author has created tips on avoidingcomplaints and allegations of malpractice related toPPE claims to help educate equine practitioners. Thispresentation will focus on how to prevent PPE mal-practice claims and will be reinforced by actual closedclaims to support the re-commendations. The goal ofthis presentation is to help practitioners reduce theincident of PPE complaints by adhering to therecommendations. The PPE has developed into ahighly detailed experience not only for the practi-tioner, but also for the horse, seller, and buyer in many cases. Because of the highly litigious atmos- phere today, veterinarians must be extra diligentwhen providing PPEs for clients. 2. Solution First and foremost, a veterinarian should acknowl-edge and understand their role when asked to per-form a PPE. The role can be established byacknowledging who the veterinarian is working for,the seller or the buyer. Veterinarians can greatlyreduce their risks of complaints by avoiding con flicts of interest. A de nition of a conflict of interest is a NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 293IMPROVING YOUR PRACTICE, FINANCIAL, AND EMOTIONAL WELLBEINGsituation in which a person or organization is involved in multiple interests, nancial or otherwise, and serv- ing one interest could involve working againstanother.3Veterinarians should have a clear sense of who they represent and who they are working for when providing this service. If the veterinarian has a relationship with the seller, this is considered a con- flict of interest and the safest course of action would be to decline the PPE and recommend anotherveterinarian. If there is no option to decline theexam, documenting that all parties waive con flicts of interest may be helpful but not \"sue \"proof. When ac o n flict of interest arises, such as if the veteri- narian has a veterinarian -client- patient relation- ship (VCPR) with the seller and is performing aPPE for a buyer, veterinarians should obtain per- mission to disclose complete medical histories and preexisting conditions if they have knowledge of the horse 'sb a c k g r o u n do ra c c e s st ot h eh o r s e 's medical records. Even when the examining vet-erinarian does not have a VCPR with the seller and horse, if the horse is a patient of the practiceand under the care of an associate, this situation could still be perceived as a con flict of interest by attorneys. This recommendation is an importantone for all PPEs even if a con flict does not exist. If the seller is not compliant with this request, documentation of this omission should be entered into the PPE report. Taking on a PPE lawsuit where there is a confl ict of interest is a plain- tiff attorney 's dream. Even when the buyer has been informed of the con flict and even in the face of signed consent forms related to acknowledging a con flict of interest, these types of claims and lawsuits can be dif-cult to defend. In summary, PPE malpractice claims where a con flict of interest exists can be chal- lenging to defend and therefore it is recommended toavoid these situations. Secondly, documentation cannot be emphasized enough and could be a veterinarian 's only defense in the face of allegations of negligence. It is rec- ommended that everything is documented, includ- ing buyer declinations of procedures, such asradiographs and drug testing. Document all communications between all parties involved including the seller, buyer, agent, and trainer such as phone call conversations, electronic com- munications, and verbal conversations. If thebuyer 's primary veterinarian (PDVM) is involved, documenting communication between the PPEveterinarian and the PDVM is important, espe- cially when the ultimate opinion lies with the PDVM. Having buyers initial all declinations of recommended tests or speci ce x a m sc a nb eh e l p - ful in resolving disputes later if a client alleges that a certain test or exam was not offered. Ultimately, when a complaint involves an issue where the buyer declines a test or radiographs and then later denies that they were offered, if the declination is initialized by the buyer, this willprovide proof that the conversation and declina- tion occurred. Another important step in the exam is to attempt to positively identify the horse, especially if the buyer isnot present. This may seem awkward at times, soasking for a copy of the Coggins Test may be a goodway to accomplish this task. All attempts to ensureaccuracy of the age should be done through interpret-ing tattoos, checking registration papers, dental ar-cade exam, or microchips. Document the steps takento accurately determine the age of the horse. PPEmalpractice claims related to misidenti cation and improper aging have been reported. Providing good quality imaging with complete radi- ographic studies is necessary. If the buyer declines afull set of radiographs, this declination should beclearly recorded in the report. Even if the practi-tioner opines that a full set of radiographs may not benecessary, the veterinarian should at least offer a fullset and let the client decide. In many PPE claims, it never fails that the one joint that was not radio- graphed was the one with a signi cant lesion. If pos- sible, obtaining additional documented interpretations is optimal, preferable by aboarded equine radiologist. The PPE imaging allega-tions are most often related to poor quality of imagesthat can be dif cult to interpret by experts, missed ra- d iographic abnormalities and not disclosed to the buyer, missed diagnosis, lack of radiography, incom-plete radiological studies, and lesions on PPE lms that developed into signi cant pathology that were originally opined as not signi cant. Examples from previous PPE malpractice closed claims were lucen-cies that develop into fractures and bone spurs thatdeveloped into bone chips. Providing a comprehensive form or report to the buyer in a time frame agreed upon between the veteri- narian and the buyer is necessary for a complete and comprehensive PPE. Too often, buyers are seekingresults and opinions before the veterinarian can pro-vide a complete report. Therefore, informing thebuyer before the exam when to expect a full and com-plete report is important to avoid any miscommunica-tion later. The PPE report should indicate that allsystems have been examined, including ophthalmic,respiratory, neurologic, integument, especially forscars and the reproductive tract, if applicable. Thereport should also include all imagery including radio-graphs and ultrasound images, videos, and opinionstatements. This is especially important with absen-tee buyers. Consider sending a hard copy via certi-ed mail to of cially document receipt by the buyer. If the report is sent via email, be sure to ask for acknowledgment of receipt. Many PPE negligent allegations are related to delayed receipt ofor failure to send a nal PPE report to the buyer. Again, it cannot be stressed enough that thor-ough documentation is important and could be theonly proof that an exam of an anatomical area wasperformed. Recommend drug testing for analgesics,anabolic steroids, behavior altering medications andIMPROVING YOUR PRACTICE, FINANCIAL, AND EMOTIONAL WELLBEING 294 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSbreed speci c genetic or inheritable paralysis, hereditary equine regional dermal asthenia).4Assure blood samples are drawn prior to any treatments such as sedation forradiographs. If the buyer declines a blood test, besure they initialize the declination on the PPEreport. Consider providing presale photographyor videotaping for conformation, size, body condi-tion, and serviceability. This documentation isespecially important for PPEs involving absenteebuyers. 5 Not all malpractice policies are the same. Understanding the policy limits on one 's malpractice policy is important and should be in line with thevalue of the veterinarians' patients 'fair market value. When veterinarians secure or are renewingtheir malpractice insurance policy, it is important toinsure they have adequate coverage for the monetaryvalue of the horses they are examining forPPEs. And lastly, consider the use of PPE liabilityrelease agreements. 1As the clich\u00e9 goes, contracts and release forms can be worthless for a defense andcan provide a false sense of security. However, theauthor opines that it won 't hurt, could be helpful for defense, and may remind the buyer that the veteri-narian should not be held liable for future issues orunforeseen problems. Here is a link for an exampleof a PPE liability release agreement, equine PPEliability release: https://avma.avmaplit.com/acton/attachment/43421/f-45296470-1be5-40b0-8953-93b551ffb41c/1/-/-/-/-/PrePurchase%20Exam%20Release%20Form.pdf. 3. Discussion Allegations of negligence associated with PPEs arethe most common cause of equine claims and accountfor almost twenty percent of the total equine claimsreported. 1Over the years of handling PPE com- plaints, the author has provided the above tips forequine practitioners to educate them on how to mini-mize PPE claims and lawsuits. Keep in mind thatmany of the allegations are determined to be frivolousonce the complaint goes through a review processwith a veterinarian 's insurance carrier and the claim may be denied. Often, the buyer will accept thisreview opinion and drop the claim, especially if theya r eu n a b l et os u p p o r tt h ea l l e g a t i o n st h r o u g he x p e r topinions. On the other hand, the buyer may pursuethe claim and l eas u i ta tw h i c ht i m et h ev e t e r i n a r - ian's insurance carrier should respond by assigning defense council to the veterinarian. One downfallthat is often discovered too late is insuf cient coverage for an alleged loss. As a reminder, veterinariansshould check their malpractice policy limits and con- rm they have enough coverage for the monetaryvalue of the horses they are examining for PPEs. It is worth mentioning that veterinarians should know the value of the horse beforehand. This can be anawkward situation, because PPE guidelines recom- mend that the veterinarian not inquire about the price and should not use any ndings in the exam to aid the buyer in negotiations. However, if a year down the road, an allegation is made that a practi- tioner was below the standard of care when perform-ing a PPE on a $150,000 Olympic hopeful, it isi m p o r t a n tt h a tt h ep o l i c yt h a tw a si np l a c ea tt h e time of the incident is suf cient to cover the market value of the horse in case the claim will need to be paid. The author supports the AAEP PPE Guidelines and encourages veterinarians to refer to the guidelines when performing PPEs. The guide-lines outline important areas veterinarians should adhere to such as medical records, identi cation, doc- umenting abnormalities, informing buyers of the signi cance of the ndings, documenting buyer declination of further testing, retaining records and contact information for all parties involved, including witnesses and maintaining PPE records for appropri-a t et i m ep e r i o d s . In conclusion, by avoiding con flicts of interest, requesting disclosure of past medical records, main- taining complete PPE records, exercising good com-munication and documentation with all parties involved, documenting all declines, offering and docu- menting additional testing, videotaping the exam,properly identifying the horse and its age, providinggood quality imaging, seeking additional opinions of imaging and abiding by the AAEP PPE guidelines, veterinarians can greatly reduce their risk of PPEliability claims.

Introduction Since 2011, four viruses have been described in the context of equine hepatitis. Two of these, Equinepegivirus (Pegivirus E) and Theiler 's disease associ- ated virus (Pegivirus D), have since and unrelated to liverdisease. 1Equine parvovirus-hepatitis (EqPV-H) has been revealed as the cause of Theiler 's disease and mild acute hepatitis, and Equine hepacivirus(EqHV) has been implicated in cases of mild acuteand severe chronic hepatitis. 2. Equine Parvovirus-Hepatitis and Theiler' s Disease History of Theiler 's Disease A highly fatal form of acute liver failure occurringweeks after administration of equine antiserum forAfrican Horse Sickness was rst described by Sir Arnold Theiler in the early 1900s. 2Horses demon- strated acute or peracute onset of liver failure, withhepatic encephalopathy and sudden death as predom-inant clinical presentations. The syndrome hasbeen observed periodically since then in manycountries. Theiler 's disease most often occurs 4 to 10 weeks after administration of an equine-ori-gin biologic product, such as an antitoxin orplasma. Tetanus antitoxin is the most fre-quently implicated product, likely because it isthe most frequently used equine-origin biologicproduct. 3-10There are also many cases that occur without any history of equine-origin biologicproduct administration. Sometimes these are horses on the same farm as a biologic-associatedTheiler 's disease case, and sometimes there is no history of biologic product use on the farm.2,11 These nonbiologic cases tend to occur from May through November and are often in small out- breaks that span a few weeks.11 Virus Discovery The natural history of Theiler 's disease demonstrated that the hepatitis was both transmissible and conta-gious, and a viral cause was suspected. A novel par-vovirus, EqPV-H, was discovered by next-generation sequencing of liver from a horse that died of Theiler 's disease and was rst reported in 2018. 12Ap r o s p e c - tive case series showed that this new virus was detect- able by serum or liver PCR in 27 of 28 Theiler 's disease cases.3,11Eighteen of those cases were associ- ated with administration of an equine-origin biolo-gic cells (n=3 ) .3Aliquots of the administered products were available for 9 tetanus antitoxin cases and 1 stemcell case, and all were positive for EqPV-H, con rm- ing the route of infection.3Ten of the cases had no history of equine biologic product administration,and 9 of these were EqPV-H positive.11Herd-mates of horses with Theiler 's disease also often showed infection and subclinical hepatitis.11EqPV-H was subsequently demonstrated to be hepatotropic and tocause acute subclinical to mild clinical hepatitis afterexperimental inoculation. 13 NOTES 296 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSEMERGING AND RE-EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASESClinical Manifestations Based on the ndings in clinical Theiler 'sc a s e s ,t h e i r herd-mates, and experimentally infected horses, it appears that EqPV-H infection causes hepatitis with a spectrum of severity ranging from subclinical tofatal. What causes an individual horse to be more severely affected is a topic of ongoing investigation. Hypotheses include variations in individual immuneresponses, inoculation dose, and a two-hit model wherea second insult, such has hepatotoxic plant ingestion, could enhance viral replication or exacerbate pathology. Theiler's Disease Also known as acute hepatic necrosis or equine serum hepatitis, Theiler 's disease is infrequent but often fatal. Affected horses develop acute liver failure that clinically manifests as icterus, edema, hepatic ence- phalopathy, and often rapid progression to death (Table 1). Some horses are simply found dead with-out preceding signs. Clinical pathology indicatesboth hepatocellular gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT); Table 2. Theiler 's cases typically also show functional de cits, as evidenced by high bile acids. Histopathologic examination of affected horsesshows flammatory change in surviving hepatocytes. 2,9,10,14 or Subclinical Hepatitis Monitoring of herd-mates in Theiler 'sd i s e a s eo u t - breaks has shown that there are often subclinical or mild hepatitis cases alongside the overt Theiler 'sd i s - ease cases.3,11,15S o m ec a s e sh a v ea l s ob e e ni d e n t i ed as incidental ndings on screening bloodwork or as mild clinical cases without more severely affected horses on the farm. Mild cases typically exhibit icte- rus, inappetence, and quiet or dull demeanor, although any signs on the spectrum between subclini- cal and fatal disease can be observed. Fever has not been observed in subclinical and mild clinical cases.13Clinical pathology in these cases is a less severe version of what is seen in Theiler 'sd i s e a s e , with mixed increases in hepatocellular enzymes and induction enzymes (Table 2). Histopathology shows individual hepatocyte necrosis with variable lympho- cytic in ltrate. In moderate cases, bile ductular reac- t i o nc a na l s ob eo b s e r v e d . Diagnosis In classic Theiler 's cases of fulminant hepatic necrosis, a simple serum or liver PCR in combination with history, clinical signs, clinical pathology, and histopa- thology is generally suf cient to establish the diagnosis. In milder or subclinical cases, the diagno-sis is not as straightforward. Experimental infections demonstrate that EqPV-H has a prolonged incubation phase of 5 to 8 (median 6.5) weeks, where the horse is viremic before the onset of hepatitis.13Hepatitis coin- cides with peak viremia and a decline in viral titer;13 however, after the acute infection and hepatitis resolve, many horses remain persistently low-level serum PCR positive for months to years.12,13,15 Additionally, the prevalence of viremia in apparentlyh e a l t h yh o r s e si sa r o u n d1 3 % . 12Therefore, there are many EqPV-H serum PCR positive horses where thevirus is not actively causing hepatitis. Additionally, horses have seroconverted and often reached peakantibody titers by the time hepatitis develops, making paired serology unlikely to aid in diagnosis. 13This means that accurate diagnosis of EqPV-H as the causeof hepatitis presents similar diagnostic challenges as for equine protozoal myelopathy and Lyme disease, where a single positive serum test does not neces-Table 1.

Approaches to improve diagnostic accuracy could include paired serum PCR to observe decliningtiters and advanced histopathologic imaging such as in situ hybridization to demonstrate viral infection in affected hepatocytes (Fig. 1), thereby linking the virusto the pathology. Transmission EqPV-H is known to be transmitted iatrogenically through equine-origin biologic products. Therefore, care should be taken when using and preparing prod-ucts such as allogenic stem cells and whole blood transfusions to ensure that the donor animal is EqPV-H serum PCR negative. The United StatesDepartment of Agriculture has issued a notice requiring that all commercial equine serum and plasma companies ensure their products are free ofEqPV-H. There is no evidence to date of vertical transmission. 13However, EqPV-H has moderately high population prevalence of 13% in Coggins sam- ples,12which can be much higher on individual farms.11This high prevalence suggests a natural mode of horizontal transmission. Limited data sug- gests oral transmission is possible; however, a sea- sonal distribution in Theiler 's cases limited to the summer and fall suggests insect transmission is more likely.11,13This is an open area of investigation. Treatment and Prevention As of now, there is no known treatment for EqPV-H, aside from supportive therapies for liver disease. Antiviral drugs targeting parvoviruses have not been developed, and therefore direct antiviral treatment is unlikely to be developed. Also, giventhe rapid progression of Theiler 'sd i s e a s e ,a n ds e v e r i t y of necrosis already present at the time of diagnosis, itis unlikely that an antiviral therapy would behelpful. Therefore, efforts should focus on prevention. Equine-origin biologic products shouldbe con rmed EqPV-H PCR negative before administration. Otherwise, there is no known strat-egy to prevent horizontal transmission at thistime. Effective vaccines have been developed for other parvoviruses, e.g., canine parvovirus, and this could be a possibility in the future. Summary E q P V - Hi sk n o w nt ob eac a u s eo fa c u t et os u b a c u t e hepatitis that can range in severity from subclinical to fatal. Although serum can remain PCR positive for many months to years, chronic parvoviral hepatitis has not been observed. Serum and liver PCR and insitu hybridization can be used to diagnose infection, but results must be interpreted in light of other ndings. 3. Equine Hepacivirus and Acute and Chronic Hepatitis Virus Discovery In 2011, a group discovered EqHV in samples from dogs by using unbiased high-throughput sequen- cing to characterize the viral flora of animals.16The virus was initially named Nonprimate hepacivirus.16Subsequent serologic screening of multiple species identi ed horses, rather than dogs, as the primary host species,17and it has since been renamed Equine hepacivirus and classi ed as hepacivirus A.18EqHV is genetically the closest homolog of human hepatitis C virus (HCV) discoveredto date. Multiple experimental and natural infec- tions have demonstrated that EqHV is hepatotropicand pathogenic in horses. 19-24EqHV is ubiquitous in horses, with 2% to 35% viremia and 22% to 84%seroprevalence in 7 countries across 6 conti- nents. 17,19,21,22,24- 36 Clinical Manifestations As seen with HCV in people, two outcomes are observed with EqHV infection: horses either clear the virus associated with mild hepatitis, or they become persistently infected and remain viremicfor > 6 months. 24,37One horse has been documented to remain viremic for at least 12 years withouthepatitis. 24There is some evidence that horses that are infected at <8 months of age might be more likely to develop persistent infection.22,23 Acute Resolving Infections Experimental infections result in biochemical and his- topathologic evidence of hepatitis (Table 3), but dis- ease is mild, and there have been no clinical signs observed in infected horses.20,23,37Elevations in func- tional markers, such as direct bilirubin and bile acids, are rarely observed. Histopathologic ndings include normal liver or lymphocytic in ltrate and Fig. 1. In situ hybridization was used to detect equine parvovi- rus-hepatitis DNA (pink) in a dying hepatocyte (arrow), as evi-denced by the pyknotic nucleus.EMERGING AND RE-EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES 298 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSscattered individual hepatocyte necrosis. Ductular reaction is typically absent. Chronic Hepatitis Persistent infection with HCV in people is a major cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellu- lar carcinoma.38A form of chronic EqHV-associated hepatitis is less well documented; however, there is increasing evidence that this can occur. Recent case reports have demonstrated persistent EqHV infection associated with chronic hepatitis in two horses.39,40 One case presented with weight loss and the otherwith fever, anorexia, and weight loss. The rst horse showed primarily an elevation in hepatocellulare n z y m e s( A S T )a n ds u r v i v e da tl e a s t1 5m o n t h si n stable condition. 39The other showed more pre- dominant elevation in GGT as well as increasedbile acids and was euthanized at 15 months due to declining condition.40Histopathology was per- formed, and the horse had severe micronodularcirrhosis with bile duct hyperplasia and portal inflammatory in the incidence and clinical ndings of EqHV-associ- ated chronic hepatitis cases is a eld of ongoing investigation. Diagnosis As with EqPV-H, determining whether EqHV is thecause of a particular case of hepatitis presents diag-nostic challenges and is an open area of investigation. Because of the high prevalence of EqHV viremia, and because horses can remain vire- mic for many months to years without hepatitis, a sin- gle positive serum PCR cannot determine whether EqHV is the cause of disease. In cases of mild acute hepatitis, clearance of viremia and resolution of the hepatitis within 1 to 4 months 37would be consistent with EqHV as the cause of disease. In cases ofchronic hepatitis, ruling out other causes, such as bac- terial infection or exposure to toxins, and demonstrat- ing persistent EqHV viremia for at least 6 months would increase the likelihood that EqHV is the cause of disease. PCR ndings should also be assessed in the context of liver histopathology. Transmission As with EqPV-H, EqHV can be iatrogenically trans- mitted through contaminated equine-origin biologic products, such as plasma.21,23EqHV can also bevertically transmitted in utero.21,41However, the high prevalence across many countries indicates an ef - cient method of horizontal transmission. For the related virus, HCV, mosquito transmission has beensuggested, 42although it is not widely accepted as a major route of transmission. EqHV has not beendetected in mosquitoes to date. 33This is an area of ongoing investigation. Treatment and Prevention There is no available treatment or prevention for EqHV at this time. Unlike for parvoviruses, there are many effective direct acting antivirals that have been developed for HCV, which might have ef cacy for EqHV. At least one, sofosbuvir, is predicted to bind EqHV by computer modeling.43However, there will be signi cant development and cost burdens before these medications become available for horses as they are mostly all high cost and of limited avail- ability, even for people. The best approach to pre- vent transmission currently is to ensure that equine- origin biologic products are PCR negative before administration; however, there is no regulation by the United States Department of Agriculture for this vi- r u sa tt h i st i m e . T h e r ei sa l s on ok n o w nm e a n so f stopping horizontal transmission since the route is unknown. Vaccines developed for HCV have had disappointing ef cacy; therefore, a successful vaccine for EqHV might not be feasible, and efforts will morelikely focus on treatments. Summary EqHV is a highly prevalent virus that apparently can cause both mild acute hepatitis and severe chronic hepatitis. The incidence and clinical characteristics of EqHV-associated chronic hepatitis need further study. Serum and liver PCR can be used to diagnose infection, but results must be interpreted in light of other ndings. 4. Summary There is a lot of work ongoing to further delineate the epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of both viruses. Based on current knowledge, EqPV-Hand EqHV are causes of hepatitis in horses. Both viruses should be considered as differentials for cases of mild acute to subacute hepatitis with evidence of primarily hepatocellular or mixed hepatocellular and induction enzyme elevations and in individual necrosis, with or without biliary ductular reaction. EqPV-H can also cause severe acute hepatic necrosis, also known as Theiler 'sd i s e a s e . E q H V might be a cause of chronic hepatitis characterized bypersistent infection and persistent elevation in hepato- cellular or mixed hepatocellular and induction of brosis could be consistent with chronic EqHV hepatitis.Table 3.

The only data available are from the closely related Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS)-CoV. The various studies have shown con flicting results, with one study documenting high seroprevalence in equidsfrom endemic areas and another study reporting that experimentally infected horses developed no clinicalsigns, showed minimal viral shedding, and did not seroconvert. 4,5 2. Clinical Presentation Almost 12 years ago, a research group investigated anunusual outbreak of fever and enteric signs in 2- to 4-year-old racing draft horses in Tokachi, Hokkaido, Japan.6It is of interest to note that enteric signs were only reported in 10% of the horses, and a total of132/600 horses (22%) became diseased. The same racing venue experienced one additional outbreak with similar signs three years following the rst outbreak. 7Additional outbreaks have since been observed and reported in the United States andEurope. 8-11Collectively, these outbreaks have been a b l et or e ne the clinical presentation of ECoV, one that is still perplexing considering the inconsistent de- velopment of enteric signs. Clinical information col-lected from various outbreaks involving 406 horsesshowed that 122 horses (30%) showed clinicalsigns. 8The main clinical signs reported were (98%), (89%), and fever (84%). febrile horses ranged from 101.5 to105.8\u00b0F (median 103.8\u00b0F). Changes in fecal charac-ter, ranging from soft-formed to watery consistency,and colic were observed in 25% and 18% of horses,respectively. Signs of cits, have occasion-ally been reported in ECoV-infected horses. 8,12 Although clinical disease is apparent in most ECoV- infected horses, one needs to consider that some horses remain subclinical after infection. Subclinical infec- tion is de ned as a lack of clinical disease in a horse from which ECoV is detected in feces by quantitativePCR (qPCR). 11,13 NOTES 302 2021 / Vol. 67 / PROCEEDINGSEMERGING AND RE-EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES3. Laboratory Diagnosis The antemortem diagnosis of ECoV relies on the pres- ence of clinical signs compatible with ECoV infection, abnormal cell blood count, the exclusion of other infec-tious causes, and molecular detection of ECoV infeces. The consistently observed hematological abnor-malities observed are leukopeniadue to lymphopenia. 8,13- 16 Additional, less consistent abnormalitiesincluded the presence of band neutrophils and shiftsin monocyte counts. Occasional rebound leukocytosis due to neutrophilia and monocytosis during thedisease course and recovery can be observed aswell. Complete blood cell count (CBC) abnormalitiesare expected to resolve within 5 -7 d a y sa sl o n ga sn o complications associated with the disruption of the gas-trointestinal barrier occur. However, both the CBCand white cell differential can be unremarkable in clin-ically infected horses. Biochemical parameters maybe unremarkable, but elevation of total and indirect bil-irubin due to partial or complete anorexia, electrolytechanges consistent with enterocolitis, transient eleva-tion of liver enzymes, and renal parameters suggestedof pre-renal azotemia have been observed in some ofthe cases. 14,16 It is judicious to measure blood ammonia in horses with suspected ECoV infection and concurrent signs ofencephalopathy. Fielding and collaborators12reported on a case of mmol/L; ref- interval, died. Hyperammonemiaassociated with ECoV infection is likely due toincreased ammonia production within and absorp-tion from the gastrointestinal tract due to gastroin-testinal barrier breakdown. An increase in entericammonia production could also be the result of bac-terial microbiome changes associated with ECoVinfection. Historically, coronavirus detection infeces has been based on negative-stain electron mi-croscopy (EM) and antigen-capture enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay (ELISA). However, the sen-sitivity and speci city of these diagnostic modalities have not been evaluated, and detection may beunsuccessful if viral particles are not present in suf - cient numbers. Sensitive laboratory diagnosis ofECoV is through fecal qPCR. A recent study eval-uated the overall accuracy of qPCR and determined90% accuracy between clinical status and PCR detec-tion of ECoV in various outbreak populations. 8The author has documented a few cases of ECoV infec-tion that tested qPCR negative during earlydisease. These few horses ended up testing qPCRpositive on a 24- to 48-hour recheck fecal sample. Itis hypothesized that during peracute stages of infec-tion or when diseased horses experience gastrointes-tinal stasis due to colic, there are not enough viral particles in the feces to be detected. Peak viral shedding is observed on day 3 to 4 after the develop-ment of clinical signs, and qPCR detection of ECoVin naturally infected horses generally lasts 3 -9d a y sbut can occasionally extend up to 25 days from onsetof clinical disease. 8,12,13As with many viral infec- tions, viral kinetics are likely in fluenced by viral strain, age of patient, and comorbidities. The role of subclinical shedders during an outbreak cannot be ignored, as 4% to 83% of healthy horses have been shown to test qPCR positive for ECoV in theirfeces.8Such horses act as a source of infection and actively contribute to viral spread. 4. Treatment and Prevention Most adult horses with clinical ECoV infection recover spontaneously in a few days without speci c treatment. Horses with persistent elevated rectal temperature, anorexia, and lethargy are routinely treated with nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory drugs for 24 to 48 hours, as long as their hydration status isbelieved normal. Horses with colic, persistent leth- argy and anorexia, and/or diarrhea have been treated more intensively with fluid and electrolyte per naso- gastric intubation or intravenous administration of polyionic fluids until clinical signs have resolved.14,16 Additionally, antimicrobials and gastrointestinal pro-tectants should be considered in horses developing signs of endotoxemia and/or septicemia secondary to disruption of the gastrointestinal barrier. Although hyperammonemia-associated encephalopathy only occurs in a small percentage of horses with ECoV infec-tion, early recognition and treatment are associated with a positive outcome. Speci cp r e v e n t i v em e a s - ures are scarce, and there are yet no licensed vaccinesagainst ECoV. Due to the close genetic homology BCoV, serological responses to BCoV vac- cines have recently been investigated. One study used a killed-adjuvanted BCoV vaccine in six healthyyearling horses and reported a measurable serological response in all horses following the administration of two vaccines given 28 days apart. 17A second study investigated the safety, humoral response, and viralshedding in horses inoculated orally, intranasally, or intrarectally with a commercially available modi ed- live BCoV vaccine.18The results of that study showed that the modi ed-live BCoV was safe to administer to horses via various routes, caused minimal virus shed- ding, and resulted in detectable antibodies to BCoV in 27% of the vaccinates. Collectively, these two BCoV vaccines, although showing measurable antibody responses to BCoV, cannot be recommended at this t i m ed u et ot h el a c ko fe f cacy data. The cornerstone of ECoV prevention resides in strict biosecurity meas-ures aimed at reducing the risk of introducing and dis-seminating ECoV on equine premises. It is important to be vigilant when working up horses presenting with fever, anorexia, and lethargy, with or without concur- rent enteric signs. Such horses should be isolated until ECoV, as well as other potential infectious patho- gens, has been ruled in or out.

This bacterial species is widely distributed in nature and can be found in a variety oftrematode species, including Fasciola hepatica,t h e liver fluke of sheep, cattle, and humans, and hosts of unknown trematodes worldwide.1The life cycles of the digeneans are complex and in their developmental cycle stages they can parasitize different host species. The Neorickettsia bacteria infect the fluke along the developmental stages of their life cycle andare therefore vertically transmitted. Neorickettsiaare unique among the Family Anaplasmataceaebecause both vertical transmission and horizontaltransmission (at least from flu k et ov e r t e b r a t e )h a v e been documented. 2The typical trematode life cycle involves aquatic snails (e.g. Elimia spp.) as the rst intermediate host, an arthropod as the second inter-mediate host, and a vertebrate as the de nitive host (i.e., bats). Neorickettsia risticii was detected by PCR in metacercariae larvae infecting immature andadult aquatic insects (caddis flies, may flies, damsel- flies, dragon flies, and stone flies) collected from a pas- ture stream in northern California, Pennsylvania,Kentucky, and Ohio. 3It was demonstrated byKoch's postulate then that horses develop Potomac Horse Fever (PHF) by ingesting infected cercariae in water or insects infected by metacercariae harboring N. risticii .4,5Because PHF has now been con rmed in many countries, and due to the wider global distri- bution of the disease, equine neorickettsiosis (EN) is considered a more appropriate designation.6Equine neorickettsiosis has been documented in the United States, Canada, Brazil, Uruguay, France, and TheNetherlands. 7Adult flukes may pass their neorick- ettsial endosymbionts to the de nitive vertebrate hosts by an unknown mechanism, and once inside the verte-brate, are capable of invading and multiplying withina variety of cells. At present, there are four distinctdiseases attributed to Neorickettsia spp., in which N. risticii ,N. sennetsu,a n d N. helminthoeca are horizon- tally transmitted to de nitive or accidental mamma- lian hosts of trematodes and subsequently causedisease. 8In a 16S rRNA sequence analysis of isolates ofN. risticii from horses with clinical signs of PHF, a uniquely different organism was identi ed and it was proposed that this isolate may be a new and distinctspecies of Neorickettsia . 9This hypothesis could not be con rmed until recently when this novel species, designated N.ndlayensis, was isolated from two horses with clinical signs of EN in Ontario, Canada.8,10 NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 305EMERGING AND RE-EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES2. Causing Equine Neorickettsiosis Equine neorickettsiosis is an acute, seasonal disease of horses characterized by fever, lethargy, anorexia, dehydration, diarrhea, laminitis, and/or abortion, thatis commonly known as PHF.11Neorickettsia risticii (formerly risticii been recognized PHF since being recognized inthe mid-1980s.11,12In Canada, PHF has been con- rmed in at least ve provinces. In the province of Ontario, there is compelling published data of anendemic disease resembling EN that has been present since the late 19 thcentury.7,13Every summer, horses are presumptively diagnosed and treated for PHF in Ontario, but the etiological agent is not routinely con- rmed by the recommended molecular testing in blood and feces. Blood samples ( n=4 1 ) f r o m h o r s e s w i t h typical clinical signs such fever, lethargy, inappetence, and diarrhea, that resided at various locations in Ontario, Canada, were tested by PCR and cultured from 2015 to 2020 at the Molecular, Cellular, andEnvironmental Rickettsiology Laboratory, Department of Veterinary Biosciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, The Ohio State University. Sixteen of 41(39%) samples yielded a positive culture for Neorickettsia spp. organisms, of which 12 culture isolates were ana-lyzed by PCR for four genes, P51, followed by sequencing. 14Phylogenetic analysis conrmed that 10 of the isolates were strains of N. risti- cii, whereas the remaining two isolates (Fin17 and Tom16) were a previously uncharacterized Neorickettsia spp.8These two Canadian isolates were closely related results were corrobo- rated by and genomic comparison with N. risticii ,N. sennetsu ,a n d N. helminthoeca . Further, the phylogenetic analysis of 12/ 16 of these Ontario isolates demonstrated clustering according to the geographic area of origin. 3. Experimental Infection with Novel Rickettsial Species in Horses To demonstrate that the isolated organism was in fact the cause of the clinical signs, an experimental study to ful ll Koch 's postulate was undertaken. Two ponies were 1cells).8Pony 1 developed intermittent fever and lethargy, tachycardia, anorexia, and watery diar-rhea, on Days 14 to 18 post-inoculation. Pony 2 alsodeveloped mild fever on Day 7, and lethargy on Day 11 postinoculation. Seroconversion was detected by Day 6 for both ponies by using indirect fluorescent- antibody assay. Neorickettsia spp. was detected by quantitative PCR (qPCR) in the peripheral bloodspecimens from both ponies by Day 9 post-inoculationand blood culture was positive on Days 9 and 16 in both ponies. Fecal samples were not tested for the molecular detection of the inoculated bacteria duringthis experiment. By using PCR and sequencing for16S and gene, the the inocu- lated strain (Fin17) was con rmed for the culture iso- lates from both ponies as identical to each other and to the original Fin17 horse isolate. The experimentalinoculation of Fin17 demonstrated that this isolate is ca-pable of infecting horses and causes typical clinical signsof PHF or subclinical infection, and therefore ful lls Koch 's postulates as a novel causative agent of PHF. 8 4. Summary Neorickettsia spp. small group of Gram-negative, endosymbiotic of digenean flukes with a complex life cycle that involves aquatic and terrestrial environmentsof vertebrates and invertebrate hosts. The recent dis-covery of the novel species, N.ndlayensis, underscores the importance of cultural isolation and in-depth molec-ular analysis of the isolated strains. There is currentlyno commercial molecular test for the diagnosis of N.n- dlayensis- associated EN. PCR ampli cation and amplicon size comparison of ssa3 gene can be used to distinguish new Neorickettsia spp. from N. risticii strains. In addition, based on the whole genomesequencing, a new PCR test to detect both species iscurrently being developed. Concomitant submissionof ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) blood andfeces is recommended to maximize the diagnosis of EN, nevertheless it has been observed that fecal samples are more likely to yield a positiveresult. Therefore, in the event that only one samplecan be submitted, a fecal sample would bepreferred. 14Further studies will be conducted to investigate the natural history of this new species, thepathogenesis of the disease, and to improve laboratorydiagnosis and potentially vaccine development.

PhD, PhD, DECAR, DACT * Nocardioform (NP) is de ned as a focal mucoid placental in flammation in spp., and/or Crossiella equi as the most common isolates) is limited to the chorionic surface of the ventral placenta without infection of the fetus. NP was rst diagnosed in Central Kentucky in 1986 and continued to result in episodic outbreaks of abortion and preterm birth in mares in 1998, 1999, 2011, 2017, and 2020. To date, the pathogenesis of the disease remains an enigma and attempts to induce an experimental infec- tion in mares have been unsuccessful. While episodic in nature, NP remains a problem to the equine breedingindustry, as its diagnosis and treatment remain challenging and economic impact is immense. In some cases, NP can be diagnosed through transabdominal ultrasonography to detect placental separation and the accumula- tion of hyperechoic exudate. However, since a limited area of the placenta is accurately visualized by transabdo-minal ultrasonographic scanning, the lack of apparent lesions in the placenta does not exclude the possibility of disease. NP treatment has been empirically applied and has been based on common treatments for ascend- ing placentitis and the results of culture and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacteria isolated from lesions post-foaling. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review and updates on equine NP.

Thus, pathogenesis of NPremains unclear. The following review aims topresent a comprehensive review and updates onequine NP. History and Outbreaks NP was rst diagnosed and characterized in Central Kentucky (KY) in 1986.13The term \"nocardioform \" was historically adopted due to theNocardia species. 13,14Subsequent NP outbreaks occurred in KY and were reported in 1998, 1999,2011, 2017, and 2020 (Fig. 1). 11,15Sporadic cases of NP also have been reported in Florida,16Louisiana,17 South Africa,18Italy,19Australia,20and most recently in New Zealand.21Anecdotally, NP cases have also been reported sporadically in California, Indiana,Maryland, New York, North Carolina, Ohio,Pennsylvania, and Texas. Additionally, some ofthese cases were recorded in Standardbred mares inOhio and Pennsylvania. Etiology Nocardioform placentitis is believed to be associated with gram-positive, Actinomycetes (Fig. 2) including Amycolatopsis spp., and Crossiella equi along Streptomyces silaceus , among others. 22-24Characterization of Actinomycetes associated with abortions during the 2011 outbreak ofNP in KY revealed that Amycolatopsis spp. (49% of cases) was the most common isolate, with Crossiella equi (29% of cases) as the next most frequent isolate. 14It has been suggested that Crossiella equi infections may be more likely to result in abortion,whereas infections with other types of Actinomycetestend to result in live, but premature foals. 25Although Actinomycetes are a group of common soil microorgan-ism, attempts in 2011 to culture Amycolatopsis spp. andCrossiella equi from KY soil samples from the envi- ronment of affected mares failed. 25Similar to the nd- ings of the 2011 outbreak, characterization ofActinomycetes associated with the 2020 NP outbreakin KY revealed that Amycolatopsis spp. (35.05% of cases) was the most common, with Crossiella equi (16.49% of cases) as the next most frequentisolate. 26In the 2020 NP outbreak, 45.36% of cases of placentitis were negative for eitherAmycolatopsis spp. or Crossiella equi .T h i s might suggest the possibility that other bacteria Fig. 1. Historical nocardioform placentitis trends from 1991 to 2020 in Central Kentucky. Source UK-VDL 2020 .EMERGING AND RE-EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 309are involved in mucoid placentitis and/or the dif - culty of detecting bacteria following antimicrobial treatment. In support of this notion, the authors ' preliminary data using 16s rRNA and RNA sequencing suggests that focal mucoid placent- itis could be associated with other bacteria.aThe analysis demonstrated that Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroideteswere the most abundant phyla in the NP cases, however, it is still not clear whether these bacte- ria are involved in the pathogenesis of NP or areenvironmental contaminants.Possible Predisposing Factors and Occurrence This form of equine placentitis is likely multifactorial and may involve factors such as host factors and envi- ronmental conditions. NP tends to manifest during the last trimester of pregnancy. Abortions typically occur between November and June, with the highest incidence in January and February.26Interestingly, the NP epizootic outbreaks in central KY were usually preceded by hot and dry weather in August and September in 2010, 2016, and 2019.27For instance, there is a negative association between Augustand September rainfall and the number of NP Fig. 2.

Also, there ispositive correlation between mean temperaturesin August and September and the number of NPcases submitted the next foaling season. 27The previous observations suggest environmentalconditions as a predisposing factor for thedisease. 27The method of breeding does not appear to be a factor in NP. NP has beenreported with live cover, arti cial insemination, and embryo transfer.26Large farms with higher stocking density are more at-risk.15 Lesion (Gross and Histopathological Appearance) The NP lesions from the 2020 foaling season varied in size (range; 5 X 3 cm -100 X 50 cm).bThe distribu- tion of the placental lesion in NP is distinct from those of ascending bacterial placentitis with lesions of NPmainly distributed in the cranial-ventral portion of the placenta near the junction of the uterine horns a n db o d y( F i g3 ) .11,12The lesion is often demarcated from the surrounding normal placenta, and theaffected placenta is covered with a thick, mucoid ma-terial (Fig. 3). 11,12Variation in volume, coloration and consistency of the mucoid material can be seenamong different NP cases.bIt is worth noting that some cases do not have the characteristic mucoid exu-date (i.e., avillous chorion with 26This distinction might be attrib- Of note,cystic adenomatous hyperplasia on the allantoic sur-face has been reported in association with NP but has also been reported with a variety of placental pathologies. 28Based on historical ndings, it appears that bacterial infection starts at the center ofthe lesion and then expands outward. This notion Fig. 3. Gross appearance photographs for seven different cases of nocardioform placentitis. Notice the lesions' (white arrow) differ- ent sizes and locations and the variation in the mucoid material's amount and coloration. Courtesy of Dr. Rebecca E. Ruby and Dr. Alan T. Loynachan.EMERGING AND RE-EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 311could be explained by the fact that the center of the lesion is most commonly avillous (complete loss of cho- rionic microvilli), whereas the margin of the lesion has raised, irregular and red areas (Figs. 3 and 4). Therefore, the margin of the lesion is the best sampling site for bacterial culture, PCR, and histopathology.bHistologically, the center of the lesion usually demonstrates blunted and atrophiedchorionic villi with lymphocytic in ltrates; however, at the margin of the lesion chorioallantois maydemonstrate the in ltration and with squamous metaplasia,blunting and loss of the chorionic microvilli (Figs. 4 and 5).

The placental lesion in NP is mainly dis- tributed in the cranial-ventral portion of the placenta near the junction of the uterine horns and body.11The classic lesion of NP is a thickened, tena- cious material overlying a moderately welldemarcated section of the chorionic surface with a central area (chronically infected areas) of tandiscoloration exhibiting loss of villi, surrounded by a raised, irregular red-tan chorion (Figs. 3 and 4). Theareas correspond respectively to chronic, squamousmetaplasia and mild to moderate mononuclearinflammation and more active in flammation with blunting and necrosis of chorionic villi (Fig. 5). 11,12As mentioned previously, the pathogenesis of the disease remains poorly understood. Attempts to induce the infection in mares by intrauterine inocula-tion of Crossiella equi a tt h et i m eo fb r e e d i n go ri n pregnant mares via oral, intravenous, and intranasalroutes with Crossiella equi were unsuccessful. 25In A u s t r a l i a ,e x p e r i m e n t a lt r i a l st oi n d u c ee q u i n ea m n i o -nitis and fetal loss (EAFL) by feeding mares with pro- cessionary caterpillar resulted in unexpected cases of focal mucoid placentitis. Therefore, the possible impli-cation of sources other than bacteria in NP should notbe neglected. 29NP is associated with three major events: placental mucoid and placentalinsufciency. Understanding the molecular mecha- nisms of these three events holds potential for the de- velopment of new diagnostic tools and therapies to forestall NP and its detrimental effects on thepregnancy. Recently, using a transcriptomic approach(i.e., ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing), the authorselucidated the key regulators and molecular Fig. 4. Microscopic appearance of two different sampling sites in a case of nocardioform placentitis (A1, the margin of the lesion; B1, the center of the lesion). At the margin of the lesion (A2), notice the signi cant amount of in flammation associated with some mucoid exudative material adherent to the top of the chorionic surface (black arrow). At the center of the lesion (B2), you can notice the avillous chorionic surface (i.e., no chorionic villi left) and minimal in flammation. It is worth noting that it is very rare to see the microorganisms at the center of the lesion, therefore, it is recommended to sample the margin of the lesion to perform culturing orPCR for the microorganisms.

Results revealed that in flammatory signaling, toll-like receptor signaling, in flammasome activation, chemotaxis, and apoptosis pathways are involved inNP. 30NP is associated with the upregulation of a set of genes encoding the key regulators of the in flamma- tory cascade.30These include pattern recogni- tion receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs).30Of note TLRs are the primary and earliest recognition mechanism for pathogen associated molecu-lar patterns (PAMPs) unique to the microorganismswith subsequent activation of TLR1/TLR2 of gram-positive bacteria, consistent with theAmycolatopsis spp. infection,31which is the major isolate from NP cases. Taken all together, these nd- ings address the crucial role of TLRs in triggering the in flammatory response associated with NP. Therefore, strategies to block TLRs hold potential for future therapies to mitigate the in flammatory cascade and to forestall NP. This notion is supported by stud- ies showing that TLR antagonists (TLRAs )w e r eh i g h l y effective in preventing preterm birth induced by lipo-polysaccharides ( LPS), heat-killed E. coli or platelet activating factor ( PAF)i np r i m a t e sa n dm i c e . 33,34The authors 'preliminary data also shows an association between the abundance of metabolically active bacteria and global gene expression patterns in the placenta, suggesting interactions between the host and Fig. 5.

The increased leukocytic in ltration in NP was the upregulation of matrix proteinase NP.30Preliminary data on the transcriptome of the bacteria in NP cases also demonstrates that bac-teria are involved in metabolic pathways and biosyn-thesis of secondary metabolites in the area of theplacenta without a gross lesion, increasing their abundance, perhaps leading to increase leukocytic inltration and placental separation. Also, NP was associated with downregulation of several placenta-regulatory genes (ABCG2 genes (GLUT1 ,GLUT10 ,a n d GLUT12 ), as hypoxia-related genes ( HIF1A and EGLN3 ), potentially associated with the placental insuf ciency accompanying NP. 28Since NP is theuse of therapeutics that improve placental angiogene-sis and/or blood flow might be bene cial for treatment. The signi cant in flammation, separation and insuf - ciency are summarized in Fig. 6. 3. Sequel and Pregnancy Outcomes Multiple outcomes have been associated with NP: lateterm-abortion, weak yet viable foals, or normal parturition. These different pregnancy outcomesmight be dependent on several factors such as size of the lesion, severity of in flammation, and causative bacteria, among others. For instance, increased lesion size is associated with a growth-retarded foal ora dead foal. 27There is a negative correlation between the lesion size and the foal weight (i.e., thelarger the lesion, the smaller the foal and viceversa). 27NP is also associated with decreased gesta- tional length (10 days less than unaffected mares) and decreased neonatal weight (10 lbs less).27Although neonates may be smaller, they do not have abnor- m a lo ra l t e r e dI g Go rW B C s .27NP lesions may also be seen in the chorioallantois in mares with normal neonates. Interestingly, affected mares have normal postpartum fertility, with an aver-age of 1.5 cycle per pregnancy. 27 Fig. 6.

Diagnosis While costs associated with NP can be signi cant, its diagnosis and treatment remain challenging. Clinically, large NP lesions are usu- ally associated with premature mammary gland development, which might re flect a late stage of the disease. Vulvar discharge is not commonly observed in NP cases unless the mare is about to abort.3NP can be diagnosed through transabdo- minal ultrasonography to detect placenta separa-tion (i.e., separation of the chorion from the endometrium) and the accumulation of hypere- choic exudate (Fig. 7). 35,36However, since a lim- of the placenta is accurately visualized by ultrasonography, the lack of apparent lesions in the placenta does not exclude the possibility of disease. Transrectal ultrasound can also be use- ful in advanced cases where there is suf cient dif- fuse in flammation leading to an increased combined thickness of the uterus and placenta (CTUP), or the focal lesion is located caudallyenough to be identi ed on transrectal ev- aluation. There are no clear recommendations forthe most appropriate window to screen, but many elect to perform a transrectal and single transabdomi- nal ultrasound evaluation in late gestation to screen for placental and fetal health. The use of more fre- quent scans is dictated by the history of the mare andthe incidence of NP that season. A recent retrospec- tive work has described the serum pro le of mares with focal mucoid placentitis (n = 6; two placentaswere PCR positive for the Amycolatopsis ssp, while the other four had no bacteria detected), and foundalterations in endocrine, cytokine, and feto-secretory markers in the weekly assessed samples. The focalmucoid placentitis was associated with an increase in progestins, decrease in estradiol-17B, and increase in the feto-secretory protein Alpha-Fetoprotein(AFP). 37Additionally, this study showed flammatory and IFNg, tory IL-5, and IL-10 in the maternal serum38It is important to mention that all of the mares with focalplacentitis within this study produced a viableneonate. While abnormal estrogen and progesteroneproles and changes in serum cytokines have been reported for placentitis, still there is no sensitive andspecic biomarker available to diagnose and predict this condition. This emphasizes the importance and urgent need to develop sensitive and reliable diagnos- tic blood biomarkers for this disease. Postpartum di-agnosis is dependent on the characteristic NP/focal mucoid placentitis lesion, as mentioned earlier, which could be con rmed by obtaining swabs to culture and isolate nocardioform Actinomycetes on blood agar and Columbia CNA agar with sheep (or horse) blood, and using culture isolates (or swab/placen-tal tissue) to perform PCR for nocardio- form Actinomycetes (i.e., Crossiella equi and It that the PCR primers used for Amycolaptopsis spp. are designed to identify Genus Amycolaptopsis ,n o t speci c species. Aborted fetuses had a decreased body weight/smaller than normal, lack of internal adipose tissue, and decreased musculature. 26 5. Treatment Given that the pathogenesis of NP is still unknown, and there are no established experimental models to study NP, treatment for nocardioform placentitis has Fig. 7.

Recently, in vitro studies revealed that nocardioform Actinomycetes are Table 2, cconrming earlier study results.39However, it is unclear whether these antimicrobials are effective in vivo.Further studies to investigate the placental diffusionof these antibacterial treatments are warranted. 6. Conclusion Nocardioform placentitis continues to cause episodic outbreaks of abortion and preterm birth in mares. While NP is an important equine placental pathology and cause of reproductive loss, its route of infection and the pathogenesis is still unknown. Dueto the knowledge gap in the pathogenesis of NP, thediagnosis of disease is limited and the current treat-ment regime is empirical with a debatable successrate. Using high-dimensional biology should improve the understanding of the pathophysiology and the host-pathogen interaction, allowing for theTable 1.

However, growing evidence sup-ports an important role for S. zooepidemicus in a wide array of diseases of horses and other animals. Thisreview examines the population structure of S. zooepi- demicus , informed by the analysis of genome sequenc- ing data, to shed new light on the role of thissubspecies of bacteria as a causative agent of diseasein animals, including humans. 2. The Many Lives of S. zooepidemicus S. zooepidemicus is a b-hemolytic Gram-positive Lance eld group C Streptococcus that can use lactose and sorbitol but fails to ferment trehalose.3,4 Although S. zooepidemicus is frequently recovered from healthy horses,5its presence is associated with respiratory disease in Thoroughbred racehorses,6,7 uterine infections in mares,8,9and ulcerative keratitis.10 It is also associated with disease in a wide range ofother animal hosts, including cattle,11sheep,12-15 pigs,16-19dogs,20,21and humans.22-26Streptococcus agent of stran- gles in horses.27Strangles is one of the most fre- quently diagnosed disease of horses, which ischaracterized by fever and the abscessation of lymphnodes in the head and neck. 28-31The often obvious clinical signs and high prevalence of strangles led to thisbiovar lending its name to the species as a whole follow-ing its identi cation in 1888. 27However, S. equi actually clusters within the much broader group of S. zooepidemicus s t r a i n sa sj u s to n eo faw i d er a n g eo f variants.32Therefore, these data32and additional analyses using multilocus sequence typing (MLST)33 and genome sequencing data,34detailed below, provide evidence that S. equi evolved from an ancestral strain ofS. zooepidemicus and is, in actual fact, a lineage of S. zooepidemicus . An enhanced understanding of the genetic diversity of S. zooepidemicus strains and the ability of particular lineages to cause speci c diseases will shed new light on the evolution ofthis pathogenic group and direct the developmentof novel diagnostic tests and vaccines. 3. Identification of Different S. zooepidemicus Strain Types Strains of S. zooepidemicus were originally differenti- ated using sugar fermentation. The S. equi biovar fails to ferment lactose and sorbitol, facilitating its NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 319EMERGING AND RE-EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASESdifferentiation from the wider population of S. zooepi- demicus .3,4However, the resolution that biochemical methods provides is extremely limited35,36and can be in fluenced by a variety of loss-of-function events that might suggest strains are related when i nf a c tt h es a m ep h e n o t y p i cp r o p e r t i e sa r o s e independently. Therefore, although permitting the identi cation of S. equi , this methodology provided insufcient resolution to determine if certain strain types of S. zooepidemicus were more capable of caus- ing speci c types of disease in particular host animals. Over time, several other methods have been developed to improve the ability to differentiate strain types. MLST assigns speci c allele numbers to each unique 400- to 500-base pair nucleotide sequence of internal fragments of seven housekeeping genes.37,38Each combination of seven allele num- bers is then assigned a speci c sequence type (ST) number. Much more variation can be detected byMLST, and as the majority of nucleotide variationdoes not lead to changes in amino acid sequence, dif- ferent alleles are usually not subjected to functional selective pressure. Furthermore, the nucleotidesequence data that are generated by MLST are fully portable and can easily be compared between differ- ent laboratories via electronic databases availableon the Internet. These databases are therefore a powerful resource with which to conduct global epide- miological studies. 38The MLST scheme for S. zooe- pidemicus fragments of the seven housekeeping genes arcC, nrdE ,proS,spi,tdk,tpi,a n d yqiL.33To date, 1,519 different isolates of S. zooepidemicus or S. equi from 21 different countries have been uploaded onto the online database (Fig. 1). A totalof 865 different alleles have been assigned, generating437 STs comprised of unique allele combinations (Streptococcus zooepidemicus jPubMLST, last accessed 27th January 2021). Therefore, the permits the identi cation of hundreds of dif- ferent STs within populations of S. zooepidemicus in order to identify disease-causing strains. 4. Nonequine Transmission of S. zooepidemicus STs S. zooepidemicus is frequently recovered from horses both with and without clinical signs of disease, provid- ing challenges in establishing a causal role in disease. However, S. zooepidemicus is less prevalent in other animal species, providing an opportunity to examine the potential of this agent to cause disease. The phylogenetic reconstruction shown in Fig. 2, which was generated using the concatenatedDNA sequences of the seven MLST alleles, highlights the diversity of the population of S. zooepidemicus as measured by MLST. S. zooepidemicus is regularly isolated from cases of disease, includingmastitis, wound infections, respiratory disease, and uterine infections in the ruminant population of Spain. 15MLST analysis identi ed that the ST-236 group of S. zooepidemicus was the dominant strain type recovered from goats and sheep in Spain andthat none of the isolates within this ST had previously been recovered from horses.15Thirty-two (82%) of the 39 isolates that are ST-236 or a single locus vari- ant (ST-266 and ST-272) were recovered from cases of mastitis, suggesting that this subgroup of S. zooepide- micus may have evolved so as to speci cally cause disease in sheep and goats rather than inhorses. Genome sequencing of the C7 strain of ST- 236 identi ed a novel phosphoenolpyruvate sugar phosphotransferase system, which enables this group ofS. zooepidemicus to use arbutin. Arbutin is a com- mon component of animal foodstuffs, and the abilityto use arbutin may confer a selective advantage tostrains infecting animals, the diet of which contains this sugar. 15Another subgroup of S. zooepidemicus , ST-72, was recovered from an outbreak of acute Fig. 1. Geographical origins of isolates submitted to the PubMLST database for S. zooepidemicus. The shading indicates the num- ber of isolates submitted from each country.EMERGING AND RE-EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES 320 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSnephritis in humans residing in Nova Serrana, Brazil, between 1997 and 1998. Two hundred and fty- t h r e ep e o p l ew e r ea f f e c t e d ,o fw h i c hs e v e nr e q u i r e dd i - alysis and three patients died.26The outbreak was linked to the consumption of unpasteurized dairy products. Interestingly, although two of the ve ST- 72 isolates listed in the MLST database were recov-ered from the respiratory tract of horses in the UnitedKingdom and the United Arab Emirates, another two isolates were recovered from humans. One of these isolates was recovered from the cerebrospinal fluid of a man in Barnsley, UK, during 2006 and the otherfrom a case of nephritis in a dairy farmer inNorthallerton, UK, during 1983, which was 14 years before the outbreak of nephritis in Brazil. Therefore, this subgroup of S. zooepidemicus may have an increased ability to cross species boundaries and cause rare, but serious infection of humans. A dou- ble locus variant of ST-72, ST-10, was responsible fora large outbreak of acute fatal hemorrhagic pneumo-nia in kenneled dogs residing in the United Kingdombetween 2000 and 2002, 39providing further evidence of the ability of this subgroup to infect multiple mam-malian hosts. ST-194 is a further subgroup of S. zooepidemicus that has been responsible for severe disease in nonequine hosts. This ST was rst recov- ered from pigs in Sichuan Province, China, during1975, which suffered from painful swelling of the joints, respiratory disease, and diarrhea, leading to the death of over 300,000 pigs in a 2-week period. 19,40 Cases of S. zooepidemicus ST-194 infection in pigs in China has continued, with the genome of a furtherstrain, CY, which was isolated from a pig in Nanjing Province during 1998 and sequenced in 2014. In 2019, thousands of cases of septicemia and death inpigs due to infection with a ST-194 strain of S. zooepi- demicus occurred in North America, 18,41providing evidence that the ST-194 strain had spread beyond Fig. 2.

Interestingly, the MLST database identi es a human case of septicemia due to an ST-194 strain ofS. zooepidemicus that occurred in a woman dur- ing 2001 after her return to the United Kingdomfrom abroad. These ndings highlight the signi - cant threat already posed by the ST-194 strain ofS. zooepidemicus to the pig industry in Asia and North America and the potential risk of zoonotic transmission to humans. Given the severity of disease in affected animals, the screening of pigs forS. zooepidemicus infection prior to their import into other parts of the world would be a prudentmeasure. 5. Respiratory Infections of Horses Associated with S. zooepidemicus Respiratory disease affects a large proportion of young horses around the world, with an incidence of approxi- mately 5 cases per 100 horses per month.42,43The mean duration of clinical signs for each episode isaround 8 weeks, and the disease often reoccurs inindividual animals, causing considerable disruption to the equine industry. Although several bacterial species, including S. zooepidemicus ,Streptococcus pneumoniae, Actinobacillus spp., and Mycoplasma equirhinis have been associated with respiratory dis- ease in horses, only the prevalence and incidence of S. zooepidemicus andS. pneumoniae decreased in paral- lel with respiratory disease and age, consistent with the development of acquired immunity to infection with these pathogens. 6Recently, cases of respiratory disease in working horses residing in Ethiopia, char-acterized by coughing, nasal discharge, or altered res- piration were signi cantly more likely to test positive for the presence of S. zooepidemicus (odds ratio: 12.4, 95% con d e n c ei n t e r v a l :3 . 6t o4 2 . 4 ) ,w i t hn oe v i d e n c e for the involvement of viral pathogens.44Despite this evidence, the investigation of outbreaks of respi-ratory disease due to S. zooepidemicus has continued to be confounded by the diversity of this subspeciesand the ability of different strains to establish persis- tent infection of the tonsils of recovered horses, which resemble the outbreak strain when using traditional typing methodologies. 45However, MLST analysis permits strains of S. zooepidemicus to be identi ed at much higher levels of resolution, making it possible tolink particular STs with outbreaks of disease. S. zooepidemicus strain H70 (ST-1), which was recovered from the nasopharynx of a Thoroughbred racehorse in Newmarket, UK, during 2000, is typical of respiratory tract isolates being recovered from horses in theUnited Kingdom and New Zealand. 33,46The genome sequence of this strain was completed, highlightingan array of surface proteins and biochemical path- ways that may assist this strain to infect horses.34Fifty- ve of 71 (77%) strains related to ST- 1 were recovered from the respiratory tract of horses,suggesting that this group of strains may be bettersuited to this niche. 33In Sweden, a herd of 17 Icelandic horses developed respiratory disease during2009.47Clinical signs included an elevated body temperature, nasal discharge, coughing, andlethargy. MLST was used to identify that a ST-24 strain of S. zooepidemicus was recovered from all horses with signs of respiratory disease, and unre-lated strains were isolated from healthy horses on thesame farm. 47Interestingly, the ST-24 strain was recovered from one of the affected horses 8 monthspostresolution of its respiratory disease, providing evi-dence that this strain was able to persist, and openingup new opportunities for transmission to naiveanimals. 47ST-24 is related genetically to ST-79, ST- ST-339, and ST-418. Fifteen (75%) the ST-24 group that arelisted in the MLST database were recovered from therespiratory tract of horses, including from cases of re-spiratory disease in the United States during 1986and 1988. Therefore, the ST-24 group appears to beadept at causing respiratory disease in horses. Anoutbreak of respiratory disease, characterized by purulent nasal discharge and coughing, was identi ed in New Caledonia-resident horses between October 1997 and July 1998. Attempts at the time to isolatea causal viral agent or zooepidemicus was recovered from 80% (25 of 31) of affected animals but only 4% (1 of 25) of healthyhorses ( P<0.0001, two-sided Fisher 'se x a c tt e s t ) . A n MLST analysis of isolates recovered from affectedhorses identi ed a ST-307 strain of S. zooepidemicus with ST-249, and ST-369. Seven of the 8(88%) isolates within these related STs were recov-ered from cases of respiratory infection in horses,providing evidence that this subgroup of S. zooepide- micus is pro cient at causing respiratory disease in horses. Although MLST has the ability to resolve different strains, it samples only a tiny portion (0.2%) of the core genome of S. zooepidemicus ,a n ds ot h ev a r - iation that is measured accrues slowly over manyyears. In some instances, it is important to be ableto resolve differences within a ST in order to deter-mine if the variation within that population of S. zooe- pidemicus arose over many years, indicative of an endemic strain, or whether there is little variationwithin an ST, which would be typical of an outbreakor epidemic strain. An epidemic of respiratory dis-ease affected almost the entire native Icelandic horsepopulation of 77,000 animals in 2010, resulting in aself-imposed ban on the export of horses and signi - cant economic cost to associated industries. 49The disease was characterized by clinical signs of a drycough coexisting with mucopurulent nasal dischargeand mild conjunctivitis. Rectal temperature re-mained normal in most horses, and although morbid-ity rates approached 100%, mortality was in- frequent. The incubation period was between 2 and 4 weeks and the duration of clinical signs varied from2 to 10 weeks. The rate of spread suggested that aviral agent was responsible, but PCR of nasal swabsEMERGING AND RE-EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES 322 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSfor viral agents of horses and some common respira- tory viruses of humans and other animals were negative. Paired blood samples showed a lack of seroconversion to viral agents. Only equine herpes-virus-4 was inconsistently isolated from small num-bers of both healthy and clinically affectedhorses. 49In the absence of a viral pathogen, it was noted that S. zooepidemicus was isolated from almost all of the nasal swabs taken from coughing horses andfrom the diseased tissues of occasional fatalcases. Initial MLST analysis identi ed that four STs accounted for 198 of 257 (77%) isolates recoveredfrom the Icelandic horse population during theepidemic. ST-306 contained 37 isolates obtainedfrom eight horses at the Icelandic VeterinaryInstitute at Keldur, Reykjavik. Fifty-two ST-248strains were recovered from 14 horses and 1 dog resid-ing at 8 different farms. Twenty-eight isolates of ST-2 4 6w e r eo b t a i n e df r o m1 4h o r s e sr e s i d i n ga t1 0f a r m sand 1 human isolate. Finally, 81 isolates of ST-209 were recovered from 45 horses residing at 21 premises across Iceland, 1 human, and 1 cat. Mixed popula-tions of 2 different isolates of S. zooepidemicus were recovered from 13 horses, and 3 different isolateswere recovered from 2 horses, highlighting the chal-lenges in differentiating endemic from epidemicstrains. Based on these MLST data, the epidemiccould have been caused by ST-248, ST-246, or ST-209strains of S. zooepidemicus , and so a whole-genome sequencing approach was used to resolve these STsfurther. 49The analysis of genome sequencing data identi ed that the isolates of ST-248, ST-246, and ST- 209 differed from other isolates of their same ST by amaximum of 151, 153, and 25 single nucleotide poly-morphisms (SNPs), respectively. 49Therefore, ST- 248 and ST-246 strains had accrued relatively highlevels of variation, indicating that these strains wereendemic within the Icelandic horse population. The 81 isolates of ST-209 had little variation within their core genome, indicating that they had been transmit-ted through the Icelandic horse population over ashort period of time and were responsible for the epi-demic of respiratory disease. The Icelandic-residenthorse population is geographically isolated, arisingfrom animals introduced by settlers in the 9th and10th centuries, with virtually no import of horses forthe last 1,000 years. 49The most likely source of the ST-209 strain was believed to be through the importof contaminated tack. Network analysis identi ed that the epidemic traced back to yard A, which used asubmerged treadmill for the training and rehabilita-tion of horses from farms located across Iceland. Thewater used in the treadmill contained no disinfectantand was changed on a once- or twice-weekly basis,providing ideal conditions for the transmissionofS. zooepidemicus between the visiting horses. Therefore, it is likely that following entry into Iceland, the rapid epidemic spread of ST-209 was facilitated by exposure of horses from across Iceland to contami-nated water in the submerged treadmill. The rela-tively long incubation period permitted infectedhorses to return to their original farms before exhibiting clinical signs of disease. On identi ca- tion of the likely transmission route, the additionof chlorine coupled with regular cleaning and dis- infection of water treadmills has been introduced to minimize or eliminate the transmission of S. zooepidemicus or other infectious agents via this route. 49The epidemic ST-209 strain was also recovered from a cat and the blood of an Icelandic woman who had suffered a miscarriage.49A closely related strain of S. zooepidemicus ST-209, Hum3, was recovered from a psoas abscess in a Finnish man during 2011,50indicating that ST- 209 strains of S. zooepidemicus have the potential to cause zoonotic disease. Bjornsdottir et al.49 also identi ed other cases of human infection caused by ST-246 and ST-2 strains of S. zooepide- micus , suggesting that the prevalence of zoonotic transmission of S. zooepidemicus may be underreported. 6. The Future Application of Whole-Genome Sequencing to Track S. zooepidemicus Infection The analysis reported by Bjornsdottir et al.49was the rst to report the application of whole-genome sequencing to elucidate the cause of an outbreak on a national scale by the differentiation of an epidemic strain from strains that were endemic in thepopulation. S. equi isolates are closely related to one another33and can currently be differentiated into nine different STs by MLST ( Streptococcus zooepide- micus jPubMLST, last accessed 27th January 2021), which cluster together as a subgroup of S. zooepidemi- cus(Fig 2). Therefore, MLST captures insuf cient genetic diversity to adequately differentiate the popu-lation structure of S. equi and to resolve transmission events. An alternative single locus typing schemeforS. equi measures variation within the 5 0variable region of the SeM gene.51,52This sortase-processed cell surface protein binds to brinogen and immuno- globulin to impede the phagocytosis of S. equi by immune cells.53-56However, the utility of SeM typ- ing as an epidemiological tool is limited by homopla-sies57and the high rate of mutation of SeM.51,57 Recently, Mitchell et al.30described the application of a novel bio-resource, last accessed 28th January 2021) to determine the population structure of 670 isolates of S. equi ,w h i c h were recovered from horses residing in 19 countries (Fig. 3). A total of 2,962 variant sites were identi ed across the 1,286 loci within the core genome, and eachpair of S. equi isolates differed from one another by an average of 69 SNPs across the core genome (range, 0to 181). The analysis identi ed numerous examples of closely related strains of S. equi in geographically distant nations, highlighting that the lack of pre-export testing, used routinely for many animal dis- eases, facilitated the international transmissionEMERGING AND RE-EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 323ofS. equi (Mitchell et al., in press). The Patho- genwatch resource that was developed for S. equi is also available for the analysis of S. zooepidemicus genomes. This resource enabled the rapid differen- tiation of 923 isolates of S. zooepidemicus based on 145,408 variable sites across 1,286 loci within the core genome (Fig. 4). The S. zooepidemicus populationdiffered by an average of 32,954 SNPs across the core genome (range, 0 to 52,715), providing unprecedented capacity to resolve differences between isolates andtrack the transmission of pathogenic strains as they are transmitted at national and international levels through multiple animal hosts (https://pathogen.watch/).

Summary The diversity of S. zooepidemicus cannot be captured by traditional phenotypic strain typing methods, which were only capable of differentiating S. equi subspecies zooepidemicus from S. equi subspecies equi. The failure of these early typing schemes resulted in an assumption that all strains of S. zooepi- demicus were commensal organisms despite the fact that certain strains can be highly virulent, leading to severe disease and the death of some animals, includ- ing humans. The availability of the MLST and Pathogenwatch resources for the identi cation and tracking of pathogenic strains herald a new era forthe study of this neglected pathogen. With thesetools, it is now possible to identify and track outbreak and epidemic strains as they are transmitted through and between populations of animals around the world. The nding that some strains such as ST- 194, ST-236, and ST-72 are adapted to cause diseasein pigs, ruminants, and humans, respectively, and that other strains including ST-1, ST-24, ST-209, andST-307 may be more capable of causing respiratory disease in horses provides an opportunity to identify genes that infl uence host and tissue speci city and that are required for S. zooepidemicus to cause disease. This knowledge will have enormous poten- tial for the rational development of novel vaccines and therapeutics with which to prevent and treat disease.

EHV-1 is ubiquitous inhorses worldwide, and most horses are infectedwith EHV-1 early in life with overall lowmorbidity. Following this primary infection, alife-long latency is established, and it is currentlyestimated that ;80% of horses are latently infected with EHV-1. 1,2Combined with frequent reactivation, this is the dominant feature ensuring the virus 'survival in the horse population. In addition, viral survival depends on a number of immune evasive and suppressive mechanisms thatare initiated by the virus and prevent the host 's immune system from establishing long-term pro-tective immunity. 3 2. Clinical Disease Manifestations Clinically, EHV-1 is the cause of viral also been shown toinfect the male reproductive tract, residing in the tes-ticular vasculature and seminal fluid following infec- tion. 4-6However, the clinical relevance of these ndings has yet to be determined. Differences in the pathogenic potential of viral strains can in fluenceclinical outcome,7-9as do several additional host and environmental factors.10 Respiratory Disease Respiratory disease caused by EHV-1 can be mild orsubclinical in older or previously infected horses.1In contrast, the respiratory disease observed in youngimmunologically na\u00efve horses can be severe, lastingfor 2 to 3 weeks. This form is characterized by abiphasic fever, lethargy, anorexia, coughing, andnasal and ocular discharge that is initially serous andthen becomes mucopurulent. 11 Abortions and Neonatal Foal Death E H V - 1i sa l s ot h ec a u s eo fl a t e - t e r ma b o r t i o n si nthe third trimester of pregnancy, in addition tothe premature delivery of foals that die soon afterbirth. Mares infected with EHV-1 can appearhealthy and abort 2 weeks to several months afterinfection or reactivation of the virus. 1Sporadic abor- tions in individual mares are most common, but EHV-1 outbreaks with high attack rates (so-called abortionstorms) have been reported and depend on herd man-agement, immune status, and viral factors. EHV-1 Myeloencephalopathy In addition to respiratory disease and reproductiveconsequences, EHV-1 also causes a neurological dis-ease apparent in up to ;10% of infected horses in NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 327EMERGING AND RE-EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASESoutbreak situations.12Onset of EHM typically occurs between 9 to 13 days after primary infection following a secondary fever response that is associated with a cell-associated viremia. Clinical signs rangefrom mild, temporary ataxia to can leadto recumbency and urinary incontinence, bladder dis-tension/atony, and urine dribbling, often resulting in euthanasia. 13,14The caudal spinal cord is often affected more severely, resulting in weakness of hind limbs, ascending hind limb paralysis, bladder dys-function, and sensory de cits in the perineal ing permanent \"shotgun\" lesions of the retina in a substantial proportion of infected horses (Fig. 1).16Ocular lesions primarily affect the choroidal vasculature and appear between 4 weeks and 3 months after primary infection. Clinically, lesionsdo not have a signi cant effect most of the time, but histopathological changes mirror those observed inthe central nervous system (CNS) and uterus. 3. Pathogenesis of EHV-1 and EHM Pathogenesis of Infection Initial infection with EHV-1 commonly occurs within therst few months of life via respiratory secretions, fomites, or exposure to placental or fetal materials containing the virus. After infection, a life-long la-tency is established in the trigeminal ganglion andlymphoid tissues and reactivation can occur during periods of stress and lead to renewed shedding, clini- cal disease, and infection of other horses. 1Primary infection with EHV-1 occurs via the respiratory tractand results in replication, shedding, and spread of the virus via the basement membrane to the underlying tissues and local lymph nodes of the head. After fur-ther replication and infection of leukocytes, a cell-associated viremia is established between days 4 and 10 postinfection. 17This cell-associated viremia is central because periph- eral blood mononuclear cells are a robust immune andinflammatory cell population in the vasculature, as well as carriers of EHV-1, and transport the virus tosites of secondary infection including the CNS. Inthe vasculature of the CNS, contact between infectedleukocytes and leads to en-dothelial cell infection, in flammation, thrombosis, tis- sue necrosis, and ultimately EHM directly afterviremia on day 9 to 13 postinfection. Viral and Host Factors A number of recent studies have examined viral and host factors that contribute to the establishment of vi- remia, virus and host interaction during viremia, andtransfer of virus to vascular endothelial cells of the spinal cord. For viral factors, the identi cation of a single nucleotide polymorphism in the viral polymer- ase gene that results in a coding change (D752 vs.N752), is the most studied and has been shown to bestrongly associated with an increased duration andmagnitude of viremia and neuropathogenicity. 18,19 Other viral proteins that have thus far been identi ed to be directly involved in viral spread and cell-to-cellt r a n s f e ri nv i t r o i n c l u d eO R F 2 ,O R F 1 7 ,g B ,g D ,g p 2 ,and UL3. 20-22For host factors, increased age, breed (Standardbred, Paint, Appaloosa, Spanish horses, female sex, increased magnitude andduration of viremia, and pregnancy or nursing havebeen identi ed with an increased incidence of clinical EHM. 19,23- 26In addition, more recent in vitro stud- ies have shown that cellular mechanisms that contrib-ute to EHM pathogenesis include the lation of hemostasis after EHV-1 infection hasb e e ns h o w ni nv i t r oa n di nv i v oa n di st h o u g h tt oplay an important role in the neuropathogenesisof EHV-1. 29-31 4. Control of EHV-1 and EHM Vaccination and Immunity Currently, there are a number of inactivated and modied live vaccines for EHV-1 commercially available. Vaccination regimens are commonly implemented in large breeding or stud operations and in the racing industry to reduce viral spread. However, although current vaccines can limit viralnasal shedding and clinical signs of respiratory dis-ease, the reduction of viremia is more limited, as isprevention of abortion. Currently only two vaccinesare licensed for providing some protection from abor-tions, and none of the current vaccines appear toreduce the incidence of EHM. 24,32AAEP guidelines Fig. 1. Fundus photography of ocular shotgun lesions in a year- ling horse 3 months after experimental infection with EHV-1.EMERGING AND RE-EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES 328 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSrecommend vaccination after the initial series at 6- month intervals for horses younger than 5 years of age, horses on breeding farms or exposed to pregnant mares, horses on premises with frequent movement,and performance or show horses (https://aaep.org/guidelines/vaccination-guidelines/risk-based-vaccination-guidelines/equine-herpesvirus-rhinopneumonitis).H o w e v e r ,i nt h ef a c eo fa no u t b r e a k ,v a c c i n a -tion of sick or already exposed animals is notrecommended. Vaccination of healthy horses inneighboring premises may aid in the limit of viralspread but should not be performed with the ex-pectation of preventing EHM. Furthermore, inlight of some reports suggesting an increasedincidence of EHM as a result of frequent vaccina-tion, initiation of EHV-1 vaccination should becarefully considered. 24,32Some of the problems related to developing better vaccines for herpesvi-ruses are the establishment of latency andthe fact that herpesviruses use many immune eva- sive mechanisms to subvert induction of protective immunity. In addition, EHV-1 affects multiple sitesof the body, and a better understanding is needed todene what protection entails. This includes whether the goal is to protect from respiratory disease, abor-tions, and EHM or whether also trying to prevent viralnasal shedding, viremia, and possibly establishment orreactivation from latency. In order to achieve any ofthese goals, it is vital to understand what is requiredfor protection from these different aspects of EHV-1infection. After natural infection, a short period of im-munity protects against reinfection, and horses arelikely protected from all clinical disease manifestationsas well as shedding and viremia. 33This immunity includes a combination of virus-neutralizing antibod-ies, which play a role in reducing nasal viral shed-ding; 33and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs), which are most critical for protection from secondary clinical dis- ease and viremia;19,34as well as multiple components of mucosal and systemic innate immunity.35,36 However, the only identi ed reliable correlate of immu- nity for protection from EHM is precursor frequencies of CTLs (pCTL).19,34Unfortunately, good laboratory assay systems for regularly evaluating pCTL arelacking. Some studies have also identi as rapid of IgG3/7 in the ab-sence of interferons and chemokines in nasal secretionsafter infection as an indicator of protection from respi-ratory disease, shedding, and viremia, 37but these stud- ies did not include horses that showed clinical EHM orabortions. Consequently, predictions may not applythe same way to secondary EHV-1 manifestations.An earlier study found that protection from EHM wasassociated with increased IgG3/7 (IgGb) and decreasedIgG3/5 (IgGT) ratios in serum prechallenge. 38At h i r d study that used the neuropathic strain Ab4 andinduced clinical EHM in 3 out of 8 yearling horses iden-tied decreased induction of interferon (IFN) alpha and increased induction of interleukin (IL)-10 in nasalsecretions collected from horses that went on to develop clinical EHM. 7Together, these results suggest that a shift from a T-helper 1 type cellular immunity to a T-helper 2 type immunity may correlate with an increased risk for developing EHM. These data are supported by a study evaluating host risk factors corre-lated with EHM by using the \"aged mare model. \"39 However, studies that include horses of all ages, sexes,and breeds that are affected by clinical EHM would beneeded to further con rm host risk factors for EHM, correlates for protection from EHM, and ultimately de- velopment of more ef cacious vaccines. Management and Biosecurity In the absence of better vaccines, current measures to protect horses from EHV-1 and EHM outbreaksshould rely on the implementation of effective man- agement practices aimed at reducing the likelihood of introducing and disseminating EHV-1 infection.10 On a day-to-day basis, this means quarantine for new incoming horses or horses returning from an on-site event. At a show or event, this means avoiding shar-ing food/water buckets or other equipment that could be contaminated, washing hands, limiting stress as much as possible, and generally keeping horsesaway from others that are not from the samecohort. Horses presenting with fevers and nonspe- cic symptoms that may or may not include neurologi- cal signs should be isolated until a diagnosis is secured. If an acute EHV-1 infection and shedding have been diagnosed on the premises, stringent biose- curity measures should be taken, including isolationof potentially infected horses for 21 to 28 days after the last new infection (https://aaep.org/sites/default/ les/Documents/EHV1_4_Final.pdf). 10In an out- break situation, all animals on the premises should bemonitored for clinical signs which includes taking temperatures twice daily. Sick or exposed animals with a con rmed diagnosis should be segregated using distance, airspace, or a separate building and supported by separate personnel and equipment. Foot traf c should be kept out of the primary biose- curity perimeter, and hygiene measures should be implemented (i.e., foot baths, hand washing, and pro- tective clothing). Other horses on the premises thathave not been diagnosed and appear clinically healthy should be monitored daily for fevers, respiratory signs, submandibular lymph node enlargement/sensi-tivity, signs of limb/ventral edema, or neurologicalsigns and tested for viral nasal shedding and viremia if any clinical signs suggestive of EHV-1 are detected. Quarantined healthy horses should onlybe lightly exercised separately from nonquarantined horses, preferably outdoors. Furthermore, exposed horses should not be moved until it is determinedthey are not going to develop disease or pose a risk to unexposed horses. Vaccination of sick or al- ready exposed animals on the premises is notrecommended. For diagnosis, a combination of nasalswabs and whole blood collected in ethylenediamine- tetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes is recommended toEMERGING AND RE-EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 329evaluate nasal shedding and viremia associated with EHV-1 infection. Testing of asymptomatic horses is done to verify the absence of shedding at the end of the quarantine period.9Virus isolation is considered the \"gold standard \"test for making a laboratory diagnosis of EHV-1 infection andshould be attempted, especially during epidemics of EHM, concurrent with use of rapid diagnostictests such as quantitative polymerase chain reac- tion (qPCR), to achieve retrospective biological and molecular characterization of the viral isolate. 9Serology that demonstrates a 4-fold or greater increase in serum antibody titer, using se- rum neutralization or complement xation tests, on acute and convalescent samples collected 7 to21 days apart can also provide presumptive evi-dence of infection. 10 5. Summary In conclusion, EHV-1 is ubiquitous in horses world- wide, and >80% of horses are estimated to be latently infected with the virus. EHM is a relatively rare but devastating sequela of EHV-1 infection that can occur in up to ;10% of infected horses in outbreak situations. The mechanism underlying CNS endo-thelial infection is unknown, as are the risk factorsthat determine its occurrence. Although viral fac- tors are certain to be important, host factors i n c l u d i n ga g e ,b r e e d ,s e x ,p r e g n a n c y ,a n dm a g n i - tude and duration of viremia as well as environ- mental factors are also critical. Immunity afterinfection or vaccination offers limited protection in particular regarding EHM. This lack of an induction of protective immunity to EHV-1 islikely due to immunomodulatory properties of the virus and latency establishment. Thus, early recognition and diagnosis of suspected cases and monitoring of high-risk horses, as well as strin- gent biosecurity measures, currently representthe most reliable means of preventing outbreaks of EHM.

Introduction Herpesviruses are all enveloped (double-strain) DNA viruses and are divided in 3 sub-classes: alpha, beta, and gamma. Currently, there are no known beta- herpesviruses known in equids; however, severalalpha-herpesviruses are herpesvirus-2 gamma-herpesviruses of equids. EHV-5 and EHV-2are frequently detected in combination and seem to bemore strongly associated with horses, while 3 gamma-herpesviruses, (asinine; AHV)-2, AHV-4 and -5 aremore commonly found in donkeys. However, cross-over and co-existence in horses or donkeys havebeen observed. For decades, both gamma-her-pesviruses played an unclear role in mild to, onoccasions, moderate disease in horses of the respi-ratory tract or were associated with keratocon-junctival disease. In 2007, a novel and seriouslydebilitating disease was described in ve horsesthat seemed strongly associated with EHV- 5. Due to location and macroscopic appearance, the disease was named equine multi-nodular pul- monary brosis (EMPF). 1Since diagnosed as an incidental but severelydebilitating disease on all continents. EHV-5 was rst described in horses in Australia. Both EHV- 2 and -5, when in their latent stage of chronic-per-sistent infection, have been found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), mainly in T- and B-lymphocytes. These viruses differ in their ease of recovery using viral culture techniques. While both require co-culture techniques to be isolated from PBMC, it has been easy to recover EHV-2 and notoriously dif cult to recover EHV-5. With the introduction of (quantitative) PCR, the exten-sive prevalence of EHV-5 (and EHV-2) was discovered. Both viruses have a world-wide dis- t r i b u t i o na n dc a ne v e nb ef o u n di ni s o l a t e do r remote horse (or donkey) populations. As a likely result of a parliament decision from the 1880s to NOTES 332 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSEMERGING AND RE-EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASESnot allow the further import of mammals onto the island, the Icelandic horse population is, for exam- ple, negative for EHV-1, Strep equi spp.e q u i ,a n d equine in fluenza; yet both gamma-herpesviruses EHV-2 and -5 (and beendetected in Icelandic horses. This shows thelongstanding pathogen and host interaction for centuries probably, which requires signi cant ad- aptation and only mild pathology during replica- tive phases of the pathogen, if at all. 2. Clinical Presentation Since their detection, EHV-2 and -5 have been described as fairly benign causes of respiratory tract disease and possibly keratoconjunctivitis (KCC) in f o a l sa n dy o u n gh o r s e su p o n rst-time exposure to these pathogens. Upon infection, there can be afever, serous to h e r ea r ef e ws i n g l ec a s e reports published on EHV-2 and EHV-5 associ-ated with dermatitis, lymphoma, or esophageal disease.3In a larger number of studies, KCC has been debated as a result of EHV-2 and/or -5 infection. One large study in approx. 250 (singlebreed) horses, examined on four occasions at 6- month intervals, did not show an association with ophthalmic disease and equine gamma-herpesviruses. Forty- ve to 60% of horses with KCC were at least once positive for either EHV-2 and/or -5 on a conjunctival swab, while 13 (30%) of clinically normal horses were also positive. 4EHV-5 has been demonstrated in endometrial lavages in about 15% ofa total of 60 mares with reproductive disorders,5while less than 3% or 2%, respectively, have also been identi ed in gastric mucosa by novel in situ hybridization technique and PCR; however, EHV-5was not associated with ulcerative lesions.7Several research groups have focused on the question whetherEHV-2 or -5 infections are involved in in flamma- tory airway disease (IAD) in (young) performancehorses. Houtsma and collaborators 8looked at two groups, an IAD group vs. a healthy control group at asingle time point. Results suggested a positive rela- tionship between EHV-2 presence in nasal swab and IAD. Interestingly, EHV-5 was only detected in(few) BAL samples, however, not in nasal swabs ofIAD horses. The group concluded an association of gamma-herpesviruses presence and IAD in their study. Doubli-Bounoua and collaborators 9conducted their study on 50+ Standardbreds, which were fol-lowed for over two years with once-a-month collection of a nasal swab and tracheal aspirate (TA) collected via endoscopic examination. EHV-2 and EHV-5were the most frequently identi ed respiratory tract viruses, often in combination, in this study. Theseauthors found a correlation between EHV-2, cough- ing, and tracheal mucus volume, while EHV-5positive samples seemed evenly distributed between affected and unaffected horses. Similar conclusions came from Sweden, where a study focused on EHV-5 presence in the respiratory tract of about 60 eliteStandardbred horses and their respective perform-ance levels. 10Horses were followed for one year with monthly sampling (13 sampling episodes), whereTA and nasal swabs were collected eachtime. Performance status at time of sampling wasdetermined using a standardized exercise test. Atleast one sample (NS or TA) per sampled horse waspositive once for EHV-5 using qPCR during the obser-vational period. Several horses had multiple sam-ples positive for EHV-5 with highly variablequantities of viral copy numbers. However, regard-less of the viral quantity, there was no associationbetween EHV-5 presence and change in ability toperform. Viral strains of the study (and two archivedstrains collected from EMPF horses) were sequencedfor viral gB, which allowed allocation of the Swedish strains into one of four genotypes (I -IV). Most strains were either in group I or III. As these horses were sampled multiple times at monthly intervals, it isworth mentioning that genotypes differed betweenmonthly samplings, and the two strains from archivedE M P Fs a m p l e sw e r ea s s i g n e dt oE H V - 5g e n o t y p eIII. 11In 2007, EMPF was described as a novel disease of the lower respiratory tract of horses. Furthermore,EMPF appears to be the most severe clinical presenta-tion to date consistently associated with EHV-5. Horses at a more advanced stage of disease presentwith tachypnea, exercise intolerance, and an undulat-ing fever. Cytology of or typically nodular opacities visible on chest radio-graphs, while peripheral areas of lung consolidationcan be also visualized by ultrasound imaging. Lungbiopsies show interstitial brosis with marked in flux of inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes. In a rst case series publication describing a little more than 20cases, necropsy results revealed distinct nodular bro- sis demarcated from (aerated) lung predominantly lymphocytic interstitial cellinltrate. 12Remaining alveolar moderate exudate of mixed neutrophilic granulocytes and macrophages,while the remaining alveolar-like epithelial cells. An increasednumber of myo broblasts has been noticed in the affected areas. Occasionally, macrophages con-tained viral inclusion bodies (IB), which, on elec-tron microscopy (EM) investigation, showed viralparticles. An EHV-5 speci ci ns i t uh y b r i d i z a t i o n was positive for the IB and for sections of (remain-ing) alveolar spaces for macrophages there. PCRanalysis -4, -5 was for EHV-5 in all 20+ cases and for EHV-2 in about one third of cases. More so, clinical disease (andmacro/microscopic disease) has been successfullyevoked via instillation of cultured EHV-5 thatEMERGING AND RE-EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 333originated from horses with EMPF.13Ad i f f e r e n t study compared viral loads via qPCR in necropsy specimens of an EMPF horse. Viral loads in noduleswere signi cantly higher when compared to lung tis- sue with a (more) normal appearance. However, the horse received corticosteroids and antiviral therapyprior to euthanasia for several days, which may haveskewed results. 14In addition, the latter study also proposed that a BALF sample can be used as a sensi-tive diagnostic for EMPF instead of the more invasivelung biopsy. As of today, several papers on EMPFhave been published. EMPF is a sporadic diseaseexclusive to the adult horse. The syndrome with its a s s o c i a t i o no fE H V - 5h a sb e e ni d e n t i ed in many countries around the world, in different breeds, and in both sexes. Simultaneous presence of other gamma-herpesviruses include EHV-2 and donkey variantsAHV-4 and -5. With increasing recognition of thedisease, including early stages of EMPF, there is theperception by clinicians that if EMPF is treated earlyand aggressively, the condition can be stabilized whilestill requiring intermittent therapy. 3. Diagnostics It appears that neither nasal nor conjunctival swabs positive for EHV-5 and/or EHV-2 are likely predictive for disease in the upper respiratory tract or forKCC. An EHV-5 positive BALF sample might beindicative for EMPF and warrants furtherinvestigation. Pusterla and collaborators 15compared four groups of horses with EMPF, other interstitial(non-EMPF) pneumonia, IAD, and a control groupwithout signs of respiratory disease. They collectedperipheral blood, nasal swabs, and BALF from all horses. Interestingly, almost all horses with EMPF were EHV-5 positive in peripheral blood samples, NS,and BALF. Animals of any of the other groups wererarely positive on peripheral blood samples, and onlyone horse out of 32 of the IAD-group was EHV-5 posi-tive on a BALF sample. However, there was a rela-tively large proportion of EHV-5 positive (between 45-70%) NS samples in any of the non-EMPFgroups. The authors concluded that BALF could be avaluable diagnostic sample in the diagnosis of EMPF. 4. Treatment Current therapy focuses on anti-in flammatory/ immunosuppressive therapy with dexamethasonecombined with additional in flammation-modulatory therapy with doxycycline. There are no long-termstudies on EMPF therapy ef cacy and clinical outcome. Virustatic drugs such as valacyclovir organciclovir have been implemented as therapeuticsduring herpesvirus-induced disease in the horse. Astudy on a small group of EMPF horses treated with an established valacyclovir dosing regimen over 10 days has failed to lower EHV-5 load in BALF priorto and after (10 day) treatment. 16An explanation for treatment failure using virustatics could be the virus 'rapid cell entry into B- and T-lymphocytes, which it uses as a vehicle to be transported throughout the body; however, this cell entry also switches the vi-rus to its latent or dormant form. As valacyclo-vir or ganciclovir are drugs that interfere withactive (lytic) viral replication, a latent stage of vi- rus will be left untouched. Still, this does not explain EMPF pathology, and it is speculatedthat EHV-5 is transferred to pulmonary epithelialcells, where virus replication could be temporar-ily more robust, and into myo broblasts that are activated by the virus to produce collagen. 14It seems quite likely that without transcriptomeand proteome analysis, the question of the role ofEHV-5 as the innocent bystander, the accomplice,or the perpetrator cannot be answered any timesoon. However, only with a better understand- ing of this virus and its pathogenesis is there a chance for more effective EMPF or other diseaseentities therapy. 5. Conclusion In summary, there seems to be many body systems where EHV-2/-5 can be found under physiological or pathological circumstances. There seems to be astronger association of EHV-5 prevalence and (upper)respiratory tract; however, a causal relationship ofairway disease or impairment of respiratory tract function has yet to be elucidated. At this stage, the role of these viruses is unclear, whether they are inno-cent bystanders due to their latency location andbecame involved in immune-mediated disease, or theyare partners in crime, potentially activating immune cells.

Rossi, DVM, PhD Author 's address: Department of Population Medicine, Ontario Veterinary College, University rhinitis viruses (ERVs) are an important cause of acute respiratory disease in horses across theglobe, with cases previously reported in Australia,North America, Europe and Asia. 1-5Equine rhinitis A and equine B viruses (ERAV and ERBV,respectively), formerly called equine rhinoviruses-1and 2/3, were originally discovered in the 1960 's (ERAV) and 1970 's (ERBV) and are RNA viruses of the picornavirus family. 6,7ERAV is of the genus aphthovirus and is closely related to foot-and-mouthdisease virus, whereas ERBV is the sole member of the genus erbovirus.8-10Only one serotype of ERAV has so far been identi ed; however, three distinct serotypes of ERBV have ERVB1.1436/ 71, ERBV2.313/75, and ERBV3.11,12Initial infection with ERVs results in local viral reproduction in thenasopharynx. In ERAV, this is followed by a viremialasting 4 -5d a y s . 13Transmission between horses occurs primarily through close contact and inhalationof respiratory droplets; however, indirect transmissionthrough contaminated equipment or waste frominfected horses may also occur. As with other viral re-spiratory pathogens, shedding occurs from the naso-pharynx; however, shedding through urine and fecesmay also play a signi cant role in allowing ERVs spread through a facility. 13-15This shedding may persist in some horses long after clinical resolution. Astudy by Lynch et al, 2013 found high levels of ERAVshedding in urine persisted for at least 37 days post-infection (the length of the study). 15Interestingly, a case study by Johnson et al, 2012 also found ERAV in a semen sample from a healthy stallion, although thesignicance of this nding for viral transmission is unknown.16Since their discovery, the contribution of ERVs to the burden of equine respiratory disease has been unclear. Several studies investigating the sero- prevalence of ERVs have found that a high proportionof mature performance horses some populations was even higher; for example, a study of 200 clinicallyhealthy horses stabled across Austria found seropreva-lences of 90% and 83% to ERAV and ERBV,respectively. Many foals acquire passive immunity toERVs from their dams at birth, but immunity wanes signicantly by 5 -6 months of age and, in the case of ERAV, may disappear completely at 10 -12 months. 18Many horses seroconvert to ERAV as year- lings and with introduc- tion into training facilities.2,20,21ERAV seroreversion is not typically observed after initial infection suggest- i n gi m m u n i t yi sl o n g - l a s t i n g .18In contrast, serocon- version to ERBV can happen at an earlier age ( < 6 months) than ERAV and, as there may be overlap intime between the presence of maternal antibodies andactively acquired immunity due to exposure, interpre- tation of changes in titer may be dif cult. Unlike ERAV, ERBV seroreversion is commonly observed and NOTES 336 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSEMERGING AND RE-EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASESrepeated episodes of reinfection or recursion may occur throughout a horse 'sl i f e .18Seroprevalence studies suggest ERV infections are common throughout theworld. However, their importance as a cause of acute respiratory disease in horses has often been overlooked due to several factors. While many performance horses are seropositive for ERVs, these viruses arerarely isolated from clinical cases of acute respiratory disease. 22This discrepancy may result from the well- documented dif culties in isolating ERVs using stand- ard virus isolation techniques.2,20,23,24The reason for this dif culty is unclear. ERVs cases may go undiag- nosed, or be attributed to other respiratory pathogens. To further confuse the issue, ERVs have been recovered in clinically healthy horses and are frequently found in combination with other viral orbacterial pathogens.2,5,23These ndings suggest the principal role of ERVs may be to increase the severityand duration of other respiratory diseases through co-infection, rather than as stand-alone patho- gens. However, previous studies have docu- mented outbreaks of acute respiratory disease caused by ERVs without coinfection with otherpathogens. 21,22,25,26Occurrence of clinical dis- ease often coincided with entry into trainingyards.21,22,26,27These ndings are not surprising as horses are often transported to training facili-ties and/or yearling sales as yearlings or 2-year- olds and encounter an increased number of other horses and handlers. Clinical cases variedwidely in severity, with some horses exhibiting mild respiratory signs lasting 1-3 days and others experiencing more severe signs lasting several weeks. Probability of severe disease was found to be highest in yearlings and 2-year-olds. 21,28 Age, number of horse-to-horse contacts, and thestress of transportation and/or early training have all been suggested to increase susceptibility to ERVs and other respiratory pathogens.21,27- 30 Therefore, while ERVs may not represent a com- mon source of morbidity in mature horses, evi- dence suggests these viruses signi cantly con- tribute to the burden of respiratory disease inyoung animals, particularly those in performance disciplines. 2. Clinical Presentation Clinical disease is characterized by a febrile period of 1-3 days, cough, anorexia, serous nasal discharge, which progresses to mucopurulent, and enlargement of the lymph nodes of the head and neck. Distal limbedema is also occasionally observed. These infec- tions are usually transient; however there is wide var- iation in the duration and severity of clinical signs with a small proportion of horses experiencing pro- longed illness.28An experimental study of ponies inoculated with ERAV found that in addition to upperairway signs, clinical cases also developed adventitiallung sounds and mucopurulent discharge in the lower airways on endoscopic examination. 25These ndingssuggest ERAV infection is not con ned to the upper re- spiratory tract. In addition to clinical illness, ERAV infections are a source of missed training days and fail-u r et or a c e .27,28In an outbreak of ERAV in 51 year- lings stabled at a Standardbred training facility, clinical signs persisted for 1- >40 days, and 6 horseswere removed from training for 8 -12 weeks due to the severity of their condition.28Subclinical ERV infec- tion and seroconversion has commonly been observedin stables experiencing outbreaks.2,21 3. Diagnosis Laboratory diagnosis of ERAV and ERBV can be made by measuring antibody titer in paired acute and convalescent sera. Serum samples should be takenat the onset of clinical illness and 2 -3w e e k s p o s t - infection. Antibody titer is commonly measuredusing standard viral neutralization assays; however,enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) haverecently been introduced. As there is evidence of per-sistent shedding of ERVs after clinical resolution, useof paired titers can distinguish between acute and chronic infections by detecting the timing of seroconversion. Due to the high seroprevalence ofthe ERVs in mature horses and the high titersobserved in horses previously infected with ERAV,increases in antibody titers may not occur with futureexposures. 25Therefore, caution should be used when interpreting serology data from maturehorses. Several studies have reported dif culties in isolating ERVs from nasopharyngeal swabs usingstandard virus isolation techniques. 2,20,23,24,26The reason for this dif culty is unclear; however, there is some evidence that choice of rapidly dividing cell cul- tures and addition of MgCl 2enhances the growth of ERBV serotypes, thereby improving diagnostic sensitivity.24Given the poor diagnostic sensitiv- ity of virus isolation, and the documented isolationof ERVs from clinically healthy horses, use of virusisolation alone as a diagnostic tool is notrecommended. However, it may be a usefuladjunct to other tests. In recent years, reversetranscriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)has been used to detect ERVs from nasopharyn-geal or urine swabs with improved sensitivity overvirus isolation, and 100% speci city. 23,24,31 Another advantage of RT-PCR is its shorter turn-around time compared to virus isolation or serol-ogy, allowing for more rapid diagnosis. Given thedifculty of isolating ERVs and the occurrence of persistent viral shedding, it is recommended thatpractitioners use serology alone or in combinationwith RT-PCR as a means of diagnosis. 4. Treatment As with other viral respiratory diseases, treatment is largely supportive. Anti-in flammatories can be administered to reduce in flammation and discomfort. Antibiotics are not indicated unlessEMERGING AND RE-EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 337there is evidence of secondary bacterial infection. Horses should be rested for at leasttwo weeks, although a previous study investigat-ing plasma brinogen in ERAV cases found that levels remained increased 4-6 weeks postinfec-tion, even in uncomplicated cases. 26Therefore, the duration of systemic recovery may necessitate longer periods of rest before horses return to their full training regime, to prevent potential comp-lications. Early return to training may prolong dura-tion of clinical signs and increase the risk of complica-tions such as bronchopneumonia. 26 5. Prevention There are currently no approved vaccines against ERBV; however, a vaccine against ERAV has been developed by Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health and been granted a license for conditional use by the USDA where there is demonstrated need. Even so,to date no studies have been published demonstratingthe ef cacy or safety of this vaccine and therefore, its usefulness in preventing ERAV is un-known. Implementation of effective farm level biose- curity and disinfection protocols is the best approach to prevent the introduction and spread of ERVs instables. These protocols should include quarantiningor cohorting new or returning horses by date of entryor seller, before allowing them to mix with other ani-mals in the facility. In the event of an outbreak, sickhorses should be stabled in isolation stalls away from healthy horses where possible. In addition, disinfec- tion of common surfaces and equipment, staff hygiene,and proper waste management will reduce the chanceof transmission between animals. Although thereare no published studies on the persistence of ERVsin the environment, other picornaviruses such as footand mouth virus can survive on surfaces for at least 14 days. 32Therefore, disinfection protocols should include cleaning of surfaces with agents effective against non-enveloped viruses such as chlorine or io-dine compounds. 33As stress has been proposed to increase the incidence and chronicity of clinical ERAVinfections in yearlings and 2-year-olds, a period of acclimation after sale or relocation is recommended before commencement of training. 1,28 Acknowledgments The Author would like to thank Dr. MatthewWittenrich for his help with editing this paper.

Frequency of synovial sepsis in horses following intra- synovial injection has been reported, but not com- pared with respect to environment in which theinjection was performed. The objective of this study was to describe occurrence of synovial sepsis following intrasynovial injections performed in ambulatory ver-sus hospital settings. 2. Materials and Methods Records from Colorado State University were eval-uated (2014-2018) and horses receiving intrasynovial injections identi ed. Patients presenting for septic synovial structures were excluded. Patient signal- ment, primary supervising service, medications injected, location ( eld/hospital), whether synovial sepsis resulted, and at what time sepsis was recog- nized were recorded. Logistic regression was used to estimate the contributions of covariates to the occur- rence of synovial sepsis following injection.3. Results During the study period, 3866 intrasynovial injections were performed in 1112 horses during 1623 sessions (643/1623 sessions in the eld). Performing injec- tions in the eld vs. hospital (p = 0.2) or without anti- biotics ( p= 0.7) did not alter risk of synovial sepsis. Most frequently used medications synovial structures); 3/4 injected in the eld, 2/4 received antibiotics concurrently. Frequency of septic synovitis was 10.4 cases per 10,000 injections, or 1 in 967 injections. 4. Discussion These data may help to inform practitioners and cli-ents regarding the relative potential risk of complica- tions following intrasynovial medication in different environmental settings.

Introduction Two-year-old Thoroughbreds are more susceptible to developing respiratory disease, but the effect of racing on their immune system is not well described. Systemic mRNA cytokine expressionbefore and after racing was evaluated. 2. Materials and Methods Two-year-old Thoroughbreds ( n= 98) were included with owner consent. Blood was collected before (up to 24 hours) and after (within 2 hours) racing for mRNA expression of 12 cytokines with roles in in flam- mation and immune system function. No furosemide was administered preracing. A paired t-test/Mann - Whitney test was used to compare before and after racing samples. Relationships between cytokines were assessed with Pearson correlation. Signi cance was set at p<.05.3. Results After racing, CCAAT binding protein and tumor necrosis factor- adid not change with strenuous exercise. Strong correlations(p<.001) were between CEBPB and growth factor A (0.61). 4. Discussion Racing induced signi cant changes in cytokine expression. Like that seen in older racehorses,pro-in flammatory ammatory cyto- kines were increased. Cytokines involved withmuscle repair and growth also changed.

The relationships between horse exercisehistory, focal bone loss, and microcracks were exam-ined for racehorses that did (case) or did not (control)suffer biaxial PSB fracture. 2. Materials and Methods Bone volume fraction and microcrack density (Cr.Dn)were quanti ed using microcomputed tomography and undecalci ed histology, and compared among 10 fractured medial-PSBs from case horses (FX-PSB), 10intact medial-PSBs from the of medial-PSBs fromcontrol PSB fracture (CTRL-PSB)using ANOVA. Relationships with gallop-speed exercise history variables were assessed usingregression ( a0.05).3. Results SBLs were more prevalent in FX-PSBs (9) and CLI-PSBs (7) than CTRL-PSBs (0). Bone volume frac-tion was 8% and 6% lower in FX-PSBs than in and CLI-PSBs, respectively. Cr.Dn was 187% higher in CLI-PSBs than in and 260% higher in FX-PSBs than in CTRL-PSBs. Higherexercise frequency was associated with more boneloss and microcrack formation, especially in the mostrecent 10 months. 4. Discussion Bilateral, osteopenic, microdamaged SBLs wereobserved in most case horses. The relationshipbetween SBL tissue properties and horse exercise isconsistent with damaged-induced bone re-modeling. Horse training history is associated withfracture risk.

Introduction Tendon injury in the horse commonly affects the su- percial digital flexor tendon (SDFT). Although mes- and experimental SDFT lesions, little is knownabout how MSCs exert their infl uence in this environment. Further, the cytokine pro le in acute tendon injury has been poorly characterized. In anequine model of acute tendon injury, the objective wasto track the temporal change in infl ammatory cytokines. The hypothesis was that these infl amma- tory cytokines change over time. 2. Materials and Methods Horses ( n= 7) underwent surgical induction lesions with (n =6 ) o r w i t h o u t(n= 1) bilateral ultra ltrate probe placement. Tendon ultraltrate was collected from the probes immediately postoperative and then every 12 hours for 21 days. 3.

Introduction The equine digital cushion (DC) remains poorly under- stood in form and function. The rst hypothesis was that adequate samples could be obtained from the DCfor testing. The second hypothesis was that therewould be differences between lame and nonlame limbs. 2. Materials and Methods Forefeet from 16 horses with induced lameness were radiographed prior to humane euthanasia. Radio- graphs were used to guide sampling of the DCpostmortem. Two samples, palmar and dorsal, onmidline were acquired via punch biopsy. Compressive loading was performed followed by histological exami- nation of collagen, adipose, ground substance, elasticbers, and number of blood vessels. Mechanical and histologic variables were compared between lame andnonlame limbs, as well as between dorsal and palmarsites, with P<0.05. 3. Results There was no signi cant difference between lame and nonlame forelimbs in elastic modulus or histologicalvariables. Signi cant differences in elastic modulus and percentage ground substance were found between dorsal and palmar samples. 4.

Introduction Maintaining a healthy equine foot as well as success- fully treating lameness attributed to the foot requiresappropriate farriery, which is of paramount impor-tance in equine veterinary practice. The equine vet-erinarian is responsible for the overall health of thehorse, including the foot; however, the foot is the onearea of the horse that generally requires input fromanother professional \u2014the farrier. Historically, the use of hoof casts is not new to veterinary medicine asthey are used to treat distal phalanx fractures, lamini- tis, hoof capsule avulsions, and countless prob- lems affecting the equine foot. Recently, hoof castshave gained popularity in farriery to maintain horsesin the barefoot state, to treat hoof wall defects andwhite line disease, and to manage compromised feetwhere shoes are not an option. However, there areinnumerable occasions when a hoof cast could be ben-ecial in routine equine veterinary practice. This pa- per describes the application of a modi ed hoof cast that is relatively simple for any equine clinician toapply. The cast application described here is basi-cally limited to the outer hoof wall, which is differentfrom the traditional foot cast used in equine practice. 2. Hoof Casts Hoof casts are used in veterinary practice to treat cer-tain foot problems; however, the rst author wasnever an advocate for using them in farriery. Themain concern was the restrictive nature of the castthat impeded the physiologic function of the foot, espe-cially the heel structures, and the inconsistent meth-ods of application. Recently, a revolutionary newtechnique for cast application has been introduced \u2014 revolutionary in the sense that the cast adheres toand is limited to the outer hoof wall. This allows thesection of the cast across the heels to be removed,thus eliminating the constrictive nature of the cast.The technique is geared toward providing strength,protection, and stability to the hoof capsule yet doesnot interfere with or compromise physiologic footfunction. There are many reasons why this castapplication should become a routine treatment forfoot issues in equine veterinary practice. The use ofa foot cast presents a viable option to equine veteri-narians that can be used on its own merits when nec-essary or combined with traditional farriery. 3. Indications Injuries to the equine hoof capsule and lamenessrelated to the foot are frequently encountered inequine practice. Injuries to the hoof capsule, espe-cially in the acute stage, can often be treated with ahoof cast. Damage to the hoof capsule such as hoofwall loss, toe or quarter cracks, white line diseaseresections, avulsions, etc. are often acutely painful NOTES 354 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSSPORTS MEDICINEand can be stabilized using a hoof cast. Obviously, the appropriate drain will need to be incorpo- rated into the cast when necessary to prevent in-fection. The rst author has been successful in rehabilitating many hoof capsule distortions in the barefoot state. 1,2Reluctance to remove shoes and leave the horse barefoot has always been for fear of damage to the hoof capsule and resultant discomfortfor the horse. Here, the cast affords protection, which promotes comfort while allowing the physiological ben- ets of being barefoot. Another use is when a horse is trimmed too short or sustains foot bruising; a castcan be applied that protects the compromised struc- tures of the hoof capsule. Scenarios where a cast is benecial in equine practice include the following: \u0081Rehabilitating the foot in the barefoot state \u0081Transitioning the horse from being shod to barefoot \u0081Permitting light exercise when the horse isbeing maintained in the barefoot state \u0081Stabilizing/increasing thickness of a thin orcompromised hoof wall\u0081Stabilizing hoof wall defects (toe, quarter, and heel cracks) \u0081White line disease \u0081As an alternative to glue-on shoes 4. Application of the Cast The cast application described here will be different than the conventional application. Trimming the foot prior to cast application is always a crucial step,and the basic guidelines for trimming will applywhether the foot is being rehabilitated for a hoof cap-sule distortion, being transitioned to remaining bare-foot, or reenforcing the hoof wall prior to applyingshoes. 2,3,4Briefly ,t h es o l a rs u r f a c eo ft h ef o o tt ob e cast is brushed briskly with a wire brush, and no hornis removed with a hoof knife. A line is drawn across the widest part of the foot, and the heels of the hoof capsule are trimmed to the base of the frog or to thesame plane as the frog. If the frog is receded belowthe bearing surface of the hoof wall, every attemptshould be made to trim the heels to the same plane asthe frog. If the frog is prolapsed below the ground Fig. 1.

Toelength is decreased using the nippers or rasp in a ver- tical direction, thus preserving the horn on the solar surface and creating approximate proportions on ei-t h e rs i d eo ft h el i n ed r a w na c r o s st h em i d d l eo ft h efoot (Fig 1A). Finally, the edges of bearing border ofthe hoof capsule are rounded using the rasp at anangle. To apply the cast, the outer surface of hoofwall at the heels and frog sulci are cleaned with arasp, and the remainder of the outer surface of thehoof wall is sanded using a medium grit sandingblock a(Fig. 1B and C). A thick focal layer of an acrylic adhesive compoundbis applied to the outer surface of the hoof wall at the heels, which will act asthe anchor point to stabilize the cast. A thin layer ofacrylic is randomly spread on the remainder of the outer hoof wall stopping below the coronet. Starting at the heels, a roll of either 2- or 3-inch casting tape, c depending on the size of foot and thickness of the castdesired, is wrapped around the perimeter of the foot(Fig. 2A -C). The cast is applied without being immersed in water rst as this allows the acrylic to permeate between the bers of the cast, thus forming a bond with the outer hoof wall. The cast will extendto just below the coronet and at least .5 inch or morebelow the hoof wall to create a fold onto the groundsurface of the foot. The cast can be further thickenedby creating some folds at the heels and/or the quartersby layering the cast back and forth and then envelop-ing the folds as one continues to wrap around the pe- rimeter of the foot. With the cast in place, a sponge soaked in water is used to thoroughly wet the cast,causing it to cure. This step is unique to this applica-tion as the acrylic incorporated in the rst few layers of the cast that adheres to the outer hoof wall is now beginning to cure, and the water added to the remain- der of the cast causes the resin to begin the curingprocess. Interestingly, neither the reaction of theacrylic nor the cast resin interferes with theother. Finally, the cast is covered with plastic com-pression wrap, dand the foot is placed on the ground toflatten the folds of the cast on the solar surface of the foot. (Fig. 3 A -D). The unique part of this appli- cation is the removal of the section of cast that bridgesthe bulbs of the heels. Once the cast has cured, usingthe edge of the rasp, the cast is scored on either sideof the frog from the frog sulci at the base of the frog tot h ee d g eo ft h ec a s ta tt h eh a i r l i n eo ft h eh e e lbulb. The score lines are now cut through using a thin hoof knife or some form of saw blade or gigli wire. The rst author uses a hacksaw blade inserted in a handle, ewhich can be used with one hand and cuts easily through the cured cast. The section ofcast that covers the base of the frog is removed, andthe edges of the cast are smoothed with a rasp orsanding block and blended with the hoof wall at theheels (Figs. 4A and B; 5C). Finally, the foot is placedon a hoof stand, and any cast material above or at thecoronet is removed by light rasping or again using thesanding block to blend the cast material with the dor-s a lh o o fw a l la st h ea c r y l i cd o e sn o te x t e n dt ot h ec o r o -n e ta n dt h ec a s ti sn o ta d h e r e dt ot h i sa r e a( F i g .5 ) .I tshould be noted that when the application of this modied cast is complete, the cast is limited to the outer hoof wall and the physiological function of the Fig. 3.

The hoof cast is worn up to 60 days on average in general practice and is trimmed the same as the outer hoof wall during regular shoeing intervals. If thehorse is kept in a continious wet envirnoment, thecast is waterproof, but the moisture will affect the ad-hesive properties of the cast, and it will begin to loosen and peel off. The cast is simply removed by rasping it off the outer hoof wall. The authors have seen nocontraindications for using this casting technique;however, casts should not be used to cover areas ofinfection, sensitive tissue, or full-thickness defectswithout taking the appropriate precautions such as aprotective barrier or a drain. 5. Discussion It should be noted that the cast described in this pa- per differs from other casting tape presently being used. The bers in the weave of this cast are not packed as tight, which allows the acrylic adhe-sive to permeate the cast and makes the castlighter. Furthermore, 25% more resin has beenadded to the cast to expediate the curingprocess. The emphasis here should not be placedon the casting tape but rather on the unique appli-cation of the cast. It is readily apparent that theapplication of a hoof cast as described aboveadheres to the outer surface of the hoof, affords protection, and provides strength and stability to the hoof capsule while allowing the full physiolog-ical function of the foot. The increase bulk addedto the hoof wall allows a shoe to be attached incases where nailing was dif cult. Furthermore, t h ec a s tf o r m sa ni n t e r f a c ea tt h eh e e l st h a ta d d sprotection and decreases wear that arises fromthe heel moving against the shoe or the ground dur-ing weight bearing. There are innumerable footproblems that can be treated with this type of castmethodology in equine veterinary practice. The abil-ity by veterinarians and farriers to con dently apply this casting technique is easily acquired after doingaf e wc a s e s . I tc a na l s ob eu s e da sat o p i ct oe n h a n c ecommunication between the veterinarian andfarrier. The structures of the equine foot have theunique ability to adapt, strengthen, change shape, and improve the integrity of the hoof capsule struc-tures if given a period without shoes. This is impor-tant in lameness cases that are localized to the foot as most of these cases will be associated with some form of hoof capsule distortion. Horses wanting to be leftbarefoot after being shod for any length of timerequire a transition period to allow the feet tostrengthen and adapt after having the interface (shoe)removed. In both instances, applying a cast affordsstability and protection to the hoof capsule withoutinterfering with any of the physiological functions ofimproving the structures. The second author hasfound a marked bene t from using a hoof cast on feet, especially horses with thin hoof walls that previouslyhad glue-on shoes applied. Here, the shoe is nailedinto the cast material rather than the hoof wall, thusallowing numerous shoe applications without furthercompromising the hoof wall integrity. This tech-nique is quite helpful in thin-walled horses as it pre-vents a close or misplaced nail. Damage to the hoofcapsule including hoof wall loss, hoof wall defects such as toe and quarter crack, white line disease, and the necessity to perform hoof wall resection are fre-quently encountered in equine practice. Detached ordiseased hoof wall can be removed, the area debridedwhen necessary, impression material fadded to act as an interface and restore shape to the capsule, andthen placed in a cast (Fig. 6). By determining thecause and when combined with the appropriatefarriery, both a toe crack and quarter crack can be Fig. 5. A, B, C, Lateral, dorsal, and solar view of the cast in place.

This type of repair is easy and strong, adheres well, and is non-invasive. In fact, the authors feel that using a full orpartial hoof wall cast for stability may become thetreatment of choice for repairing hoof wall defects. 6. Conclusion This method of cast application has huge implica-tions for both veterinarians and farriers, whetherthe horse is shod or barefoot. The reluctance ofmany veterinarians, farriers, and horse owners toremove the shoes to rehabilitate the hoof capsule ortransition to being barefoot is due to the initial discom-f o r tt h eh o r s em a ye x p e r i e n c ea n dt h ed a m a g et ot h ehoof capsule without the protection of a shoe. Here isa hoof cast application that will bridge that gap whileallowing the structures of the hoof to adapt,strengthen, change foot conformation, and restore itself. The potential uses for this hoof cast applica- tion are unlimited and only now being imagined.

Introduction There has been substantial growth in the understand- ing of osteoarthritis and in the development of noveltherapies over the past few years. The aim of the present study was to compare the use of various joint therapies over the past 10 years. 2. Materials and Methods An electronic survey was administered to AmericanAssociation of Equine Practitioners members.Questions from a similar survey administered10 years ago were repeated, and new questions wereadded. The responses were tabulated, analyzed,and compared to those of the previous survey. 3. Results Methylprednisolone acetate was signi cantly less commonly used for high-motion joints than previouslyreported (odds ratio \u00bc2.39, p<0.001). The likeli- hood of respondents having used autologous condi-tioned serum was almost 3 times higher now (oddsratio\u00bc2.97, p<0.001). There is an increased use of concomitant antibiotic therapy with intra-articularmedication. 4. Discussion Triamcinolone acetonide remains the most commonlyused therapy to treat high-motion joints. The use ofmethylprednisolone acetate to treat high-motion jointshas signi cantly decreased, which is likely associated with its reported harmful effect on cartilage. The useof biological therapies in joints has become more popu-lar, which could be associated with recent supportivescienti c evidence and increased availability of these products on the market. The increased use of antibi-otics with intra-articular therapy is not in agreementwith the current literature 's recommendations.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of APS on tendon heal-i n gi na ne q u i n es u p e r cial digital flexor (SDF) tendonitis model. The authors hypothesized that intralesional injection of APS would result in superior structural and biomechanicalhealing.2. Materials and Methods SDF tendonitis was induced in both forelimbs of eight horses using collagenase injection. One forelimbreceived an intralesional injection of APS, while theother was injected with saline. Ultrasonographicexaminations were performed at 2 week intervals fol-lowing treatment. At 12 weeks, horses were eu-thanized and SDF samples harvested. Histologicevaluation, biomechanical testing, gene expres-sion analysis and total glycosaminoglycan (GAG),and total DNA quanti cation were performed.

Results Collagen type III ( COL3A1 - cantly higher 0.028) in saline-treated tendon than in normal tendon. Mean total DNA content was sig-nicantly higher (p = 0.024) in saline-treated tendons than normal tendons, whereas total DNA content wasnot signi cantly different between APS treated ten- don and normal tendon. No other statistically signif-icant results were reported. 4. Discussion Reduced expression of COL3A1 in APS-treated ten- don may indicate superior healing. Increased totalDNA content in saline-treated tendons may indicateongoing healing processes, versus APS-treatedtendons which may be in the later stages ofhealing.

Donnelly, DVM, MBA This paper outlines how to identify factors that may contribute to inef ciency, what systems need to be improved, and how to increase employee productivity. Author 's address: ALD Veterinary Consulting, LLC, e-mail: adonnelly@aldvet.com. \u00a92021 AAEP. Team development is unquestionably one of the great- est challenges for most veterinary practice leaders.This includes how to effectively onboard employeesand build an ef cient, productive team. Another frustration occurs if practice leaders promote seem-ingly talented employees to supervisory roles only to nd they don' t excel in their new job roles. One of the keys to addressing these challenges is to determine whether the practice has a systems problem vs. a peo-ple problem or both. For the practice to runsmoothly, the business must have systems in placethat enhance ef ciency and productivity. Likewise, the business needs to have well-trained, engaged teammembers who desire to contribute to the success of theorganization. 2. Practice Assessment Before deciding on solutions to implement to increaseteam development and ef ciency, it 's essential to rst assess possible underlying causes of any problems.Practice leaders can begin by looking for signs of inef - ciency in daily operations. One way to do this is tothink of daily challenges or slowdowns in workfl ow that occur on a regular basis. For example, are thereproblems with scheduling? Are team members con-sistently trying to locate missing paperwork, charts, or equipment? Do managers or doctors nd they are constantly interrupted by team members asking fordirection? It 's also helpful to track and evaluate any inefciencies to determine the signi cance of the problem. For example, if scheduling truly is a prob-lem, this may be re flected in a decline in the number of farm calls each month. Likewise, to track the inef-ciency associated with employee interruptions, doc- tors can track whether this slows down theirproductivity on a regular basis or whether it only occurs for a short time with new hires. Once the signs of inef ciency are identi ed, consider factors that may be causing the problem. Staff shortages, for example, are de nitely a major problem for many practices. But other causes for inef ciencies include unclear or inconsistent protocols, problems with sched-uling, and disorganized team members. Likewise,poorly de ned job roles and a lack of training can cause slowdowns in work flow. When thinking about the causes of inef ciency, look at whether one or more team members are involved. If multiple employeesdemonstrate a lack of accountability or inef ciency, the problem is most likely a systems problem. Onthe other hand, if one or two team members keep NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 365BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: LEVERAGE THE TALENT OF YOUR TEAMm a k i n gt h es a m em i s t a k eo rd e m o n s t r a t ei n f e r i o rj o b performance, this indicates a people problem. Whenassessing ef ciency, it 'sa l s ow i s et oe v a l u a t ek e yp e r - formance indicators (KPIs) to see how the practice isperforming. Look at the revenues and doctor trans-actions, for example, to see if they are consistent or higher than previous quarters or years. The KPIs can indicate if there is a problem with business per-formance, how much growth has occurred, and whether the perception of inef ciency is related to the stress and possibly burnout of team members. If the number of transactions hasn 't increased but the team is unhappy and complaining about inef ciencies, then the problem may be staff shortages or decreased em-ployee well-being. On the other hand, if transactions have increased signi cantly, then inef ciencies might be related to a lack of training for new hires and lack of clarity on protocols. 3. Identifying Processes to Improve Operational Efficiency T h ep r a c t i c ea s s e s s m e n ti sl i k e l yt ou n c o v e ro n eo r more of the following common systems problems. Taking action to improve these processes will result in a business that runs more smoothly even when the practice manager and owner aren' tp r e s e n t . Define Clear Protocols When contemplating the practice 's operational proto- cols, think about whether any protocols are missing orlack clarity as well as whether they are documentedin writing. Often protocols are well known by experi- enced team members but may not be clear to those with less experience or new hires. When protocolsare written, it makes training much easier and helpsto increase employee accountability. To developwritten protocols, ideally practice leaders shouldinclude the entire team. Team members who areinvolved in providing services or completing job duties are the ones best suited to determine if protocols are missing and whether they are clear. The team cancreate a list of protocols that need to be drafted orupdated. Putting protocols in writing can be adaunting task, so it makes sense to prioritize thelist of necessary protocols. Focus rst on those that are most important for patient care and dailyoperations. For example, a protocol for how tocomplete a routine procedure or frequent clientcommunications would take precedence over onefor how to complete a job task that is only doneoccasionally. To make progress, practices shouldset a goal to complete the protocols according to a speci ed timeline. Many protocols can be drafted using bullet points and are no longer than one p a g e . I nt h i sc a s e ,i tm a yb ep o s s i b l et od r a f ta tleast one protocol every one to two weeks.Implement Standard Operating Procedures Often practices have team members that complete work in many different ways. Likewise, it 'sn o t uncommon to have different doctors with different standards or ways of doing procedures. Within reason, practices should determine the most appropriate, ef cient way to complete routine pro- cedures, treatments and surgeries. Not onlydoes this help increase ef ciency, it helps elimi- nate confusion and makes training more effective when onboarding employees. Organize Workflow Practices should establish speci c organization proce- d u r e sf o ra l la r e a so ft h eb u s i n e s sa st h i sc a nh e l p employees be more productive and save time. For example, making sure charts, check-in sheets, labresults, or travel sheets have a designated home helps with ef ciency, so people don 't waste time trying to nd paperwork. Likewise, stocking rooms and trucks with all the necessary supplies and equipment means team members don 'th a v et ow a s t et i m et r y i n g tond something. Remember that implementing multiple action steps to organize workfl ow can add up to signi cant improvements in operational ef ciency. Clearly Define Job Roles Completing certain job tasks and ful lling job duties often falls to multiple team members in the same department. Unfortunately, if job roles and expecta- tions aren 't well-de ned, employees may o tw a sm yj o b \"or say \"I thought Bob was g o i n gt od oi t . \"A n de v e nw h e nt e a mm e m b e r sa r e committed to doing an excellent job, there may be con- fusion about job responsibilities and job expectations if they aren 't clearly de ned. Leveraging the Use of Technology It's always wise to determine if technology solutions can help increase operational ef ciency. This may include having clients ll out new client information forms or the patient 's history online prior to coming in which saves time at the beginning of ap- pointments. Leveraging the use of technology includes having prepared treatment plans for allcommon medical procedures, treatments, and sur- geries so team members don 't have to generate a new treatment plan for every client. Managerscan link service codes in the practice management software for those services that are typically done together when creating treatment plans. It also h e l p ss a v et i m et or e d u c et h en u m b e ro fc o m p u t e rcodes for services, so employees don 'th a v et os t o p and ask a co-worker or the doctor which code touse. 4. Improving Team Productivity Even practices with effective systems can experi- ence challenges with team development. Aside from having insuf cient staff, the following peopleBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: LEVERAGE THE TALENT OF YOUR TEAM 366 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSproblems can cause inef ciency and a lack of team productivity: \u0081Lack of trained and/or skilled team members \u0081Lack of accountability \u0081Employee con flict, drama, and problem behaviors \u0081Lack of employee empowerment \u0081Lack of motivation and self-leadership Therst step to creating a productive team is to make sure the business sets employees up for success with excellent orientation and onboarding systems. Improving Orientation and Onboarding Employee orientation includes all the activities involved with helping integrate new hires into the organization. Unfortunately, orientation is often ineffective in many practices because it' s essentially non-existent or too short. Simply telling employeeshow to clock in and giving them the employee manual and details about their schedule is not orien- tation. A half-day of direction is also not suf - cient orientation. Orientation shouldn 'tb e rushed as this critical time period can make or break whether a new hire turns out to be an excel- lent addition to the team. To implement an ori-entation process that leads to enhanced retention,consider that the entire 90-day introductory pe- riod for a new employee is their orientation period. This doesn 't mean they won 'tu n d e r g o training during this time, but this paradigm helpsto ensure practice leaders recognize the need topay attention to employees during their rst few months. Using a detailed checklist is a good wayto outline all the activities that should occur dur-ing orientation. It can include items such ascompleting relevant new hire paperwork, learning about employee bene ts, reviewing job duties and expectations, and learning practice protocols. The checklist should also include a schedule for train-ing sessions and when supervisors or managers will complete reviews of job performance. An- other often overlooked part of orientation is toinclude a meeting for new hires to learn about thepractice history, mission, vision, core values, and culture. This helps new team members gain an understanding of what it means to work at thepractice and how they t in. Employee onboard- ing is the process for new employees to gain the requisite knowledge, skills, and pro ciencies to be a b l et od ot h e i rj o bc o m p e t e n t l ya n dc o n t r i b u t et o the success of the business. The length of timefor onboarding is variable, but most businesses consider the r s t6 - 1 2 m o n t h st ob et h eo n b o a r d - ing period. As with orientation, managers can improve onboarding by using a checklist to trackthe progress of learning for new hires. Effective onboarding includes the need to develop and implement comprehensive training programs.Given the scope of this project, it 's best to enlistthe participation of multiple team members whocan be part of a training team for the business. Employee Training and Development Essentially, employee development is all the efforts to assist in the professional growth and learning for team members. To determine whether the practicehas an effective employee developmental program inplace, consider the answers to the following questions: \u0081Does the business have a formal training pro- gram for new hires? \u0081Is there a plan to provide ongoing training to all employees? \u0081Does the practice utilize multiple resources toprovide training for employees? \u0081Do training programs have supporting tools and materials? \u0081Do employees meet regularly with managers to discuss their training needs? \u0081Are employees encouraged to develop new skills? \u0081Does the practice have a training budget? \u0081Are employees empowered to utilize theirskills? \u0081Does every employee have a written develop- mental plan reviewed with managers quarterly or bi-annually? Each employee should have a written development plan that outlines their goals and action steps to achieve the goals. The action steps need to be spe-cic and include a timeline. Bear in mind that it is far better to establish a reasonable number of goalseach year rather than try to do too much given thebusy work schedules of most employees. Managersshould meet with employees at least quarterly to dis-cuss their progress. Developing Managers All too often, employees are promoted into supervisory or management positions, but they don' t excel in their new roles. In part this may be because the team member is not suited for the leadership position.However, the problem is often related to a lack oftraining and leadership coaching that is necessary fort h ee m p l o y e et ou n d e r s t a n dh o wt ob es u c c e s s f u lc o m -pleting their new job duties. Before promotingemployees, the practice manager or owner shouldmeet with them to discuss the job expectations andduties that go along with the new position. Forexample, will the new position require working differ-ent hours or being available after-hours? Perhaps the new position will require attendance at leadership meetings or continuing education seminars. Oftenjob duties for middle managers include being involvedin supervising their co-workers and the employeereview process. It 's important to make sure new managers understand these new responsibilities. ABUSINESS OF PRACTICE: LEVERAGE THE TALENT OF YOUR TEAM AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 367development plan should be put in place for managers who are promoted so they can learn and grow. Theplan needs to outline speci ca c t i o ns t e p sf o rt h et e a m member to gain knowledge and skills they need to bea successful manager. This may include takingadvantage of resources such as books, articles, webi-nars, and professional meetings. New managersalso need to receive ongoing guidance and feedback asthey assume their new job role. Most people needcoaching in areas such as communication skills, beinga role model, and giving co-workers feedback. Thepractice needs to identify who will serve as a mentoror coach for the manager. This could be the practiceowner, an associate veterinarian, the practice man-ager, another manager, or an outside consultant. Enhancing Employee Empowerment and Problem-Solving One of the biggest drains on practice ef ciency occurs when team members have to seek out supervisors forassistance or approval before taking action. Considerthe following examples of how ef ciency and team- work suffer because employees aren 'tt r a i n e do r empowered to be problem-solvers. \u0081Client service representatives who must check with the practice manager before making a minor adjustment to an invoice. \u0081Team members who must check with the prac- tice manager about payment options for the client. \u0081An owner or trainer who waits while staff check to seek approval for them to drop off a patient outside the normally scheduled times. \u0081Technicians wait to proceed with procedures to see in what order the doctor wants them done. \u0081The inventory manager can 't complete the drug order because they have to check with the doc-tor about a substitution; this slows the order and necessitates more phone calls. If any of these scenarios sound familiar, then prac- tice leaders should take advantage of the opportunity to increase employee empowerment and the problem-solving capabilities of their team. Not only doesincreasing employee empowerment increase ef - ciency, it is a well proven strategy to increaseengagement. When team members are highlyengaged, they have greater job satisfaction and con-tribute more to the success of the business. Toempower employees, practice leaders should begin bymaking sure job expectations are clear and team members know their boundaries related to whataction they can take. Let' s look at the example of a disgruntled client who isn 't happy with their bill. Perhaps they feel they weren 't properly informed about the cost of a service. A fully empow-ered team member is one who knows to provide thehighest possible service and what actions they can take to enhance client satisfaction. This includes knowing the boundaries for how much (if any) theycan adjust a bill and whether there are other actionsthey can take to help the client. Another way toincrease empowerment is to encourage employees tooffer ideas and possible solutions for how they think aproblem should be handled rather than just askinghow they should proceed. In time, employees will learn to present possible solutions to problems and feel comfortable making decisions on their own aboutminor variations in daily operations. Excellent ques-tions to ask team members to encourage problem-solv-ing include the following: \u0081\"What have you done so far to solve this problem? \" \u0081\"How do you think we can resolve this issue? \" \u0081\"What ideas do you have to address this situation? \" 5. Conclusion With proper training and coaching, employees can be more ef cient and effective in their jobs. Team mem- bers that can quickly respond to a variety of situations and client demands are invaluable since every timean employee has to seek out a manager or veterinar- i a nt om a k ead e c i s i o n ,e f ciency suffers. With increases in ef ciency, practice productivity increases as well. Ef cient, well-trained healthcare teams are capable of seeing more patients, performing more pro- cedures, and scheduling more surgeries.

Introduction A look at the telemedicine trends in human healthcare can provide valuable insights for veterinary medicine,which often follows trends that are relevant and appli-cable within veterinary healthcare. Additionally,human patients are the animal owners that have come to expect a level of veterinary healthcare that rivals human healthcare. Their adoption rate of tele-medicine in their own care will surely lead to similarexpectations for their own animals to receive veteri- nary telemedicine. Telemedicine/telehealth/virtual care (referred to in this paper as telemedicine) is thenatural evolution of healthcare in the digital worldand has been ignited to the point that it has becomefundamental in how human healthcare professionals deliver care to patients, from urban centers to rural communities. Telemedicine is the practice of medi-cine using technology to deliver care remotely suchthat treating and monitoring patients no longer has to begin and end in a hospital or clinic. Telemedicine iswell positioned to become a standard service in bothhuman and veterinary healthcare. The American Telemedicine Association was established 38 years ago, in 1983, with a goal to promote access to care viatelecommunications technology. 1Since then, the upward trajectory of adoption of telemedicine has beenslow but steady until 2020, when COVID became a substantial catalyst that spurred exponential growthin the use of telemedicine by both healthcare providersand patients. By April 2020, nearly all primary carephysicians (97%) were using telemedicine to treatpatients. 2Telemedicine use by rural health centers increased during the pandemic, peaking at 54% in thelast week of April 2020. 3Medicare bene ciaries using telemedicine exploded from just 13,000 perweek before the pandemic to 1.7 million per NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 369BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: LEVERAGE THE TALENT OF YOUR TEAMweek.4Stanford Healthcare, one of the notable lead- ers in telemedicine, reports that 30% to 40% of visits remain remote despite the resumption of in-personvisits. 5They cite reliability, ef ciency, and conven- ience in allowing patients to receive routine care they need virtually anytime, anywhere. More than 75% of physicians surveyed said telemedicine provided better care for patients.6Studies have shown that in most cases, telehealth was equivalent to in-person care, and in some areas, it was better.7Most, if not all, veteri- nary clients are also human patients; thus, the opinion of these end users matters in guiding both human and veterinary healthcare. At least 28 studies haveshown that > 80% of patients indicated satisfactionwith telemedicine, including general practice, neurology, and rheumatology. 8Levels of patient satis- faction for telemedicine are among the highest of all healthcare, insurance, and nancial service industries.9Patient responses indicated that 85.5% said telemedicine made it easier to get the care theyneeded, and 77% said they were completely satis ed with virtual care. 10Of patients surveyed, 75% said they expect virtual care to be a standard part of theircare, with 50% saying they would switch providers to have virtual care visits on a regular basis. 11Their three top drivers were convenience, speed of access, and safety of being seen at home. In contrast towhat was predicted, 45,000 patients said video visitsresulted in greater satisfaction than in-person visits. 12Some of the major factors that enhance telemedicine are the rising development and adop- tion of technologies, such as the Internet of Thingsand arti cial intelligence, by human patients and animal owners. These data have substantial con- sequences to veterinarians because they suggest that veterinary clients are expecting telemedicineas an option in their own care, with the implicationbeing that they will demand the same in the care oftheir animals. Ignoring these trends, along with client opinions and preferences, could be disadvan- tageous to veterinary practices and their potentialfor the highest level of success. 2. Definitions Virtual care is an umbrella term that encompasses all forms of telehealth. Telehealth is a next-level overarching term that includes use of technologyto remotely deliver care, information, and edu-cation. Telemedicine refers to the provision ofpatient care by remote application of technologies,including the transmission of information via elec- tronic communications, such as video, text, instant messaging, telephone, etc. Synchronous telemedi-cine is essentially real-time virtual visits, usingvideo, telephone, or live chat. Asynchronous tele-medicine refers to the \"store and forward \"tech- nique in which clients collect and provide medicalhistory and other supporting information and sendit to the veterinarian for later evaluation, and/or veterinarians collect medical history and other sup- porting information, such as images and pathology reports, and send them to a veterinary specialist for diagnostic and treatment expertise. Teletriage pro- vides timely guidance, not a diagnosis, with the oppor- tunity to obtain the patient' s medical history, learn about the current problems, and determine whether a virtual visit is suf cient to address the problem or whether an in-person visit is indicated, including howurgent that visit should be. Telemonitoring allows postsurgical and postdischarge monitoring of patients remotely. The capabilities of telemonitoring will be expanded substantially in concert with further devel- opments of technologies, like mobile monitoring devi- ces, wearables, insideables, etc. Digital technologieswill be able to allow monitoring of vital signs, electro- cardiograms (ECGs), glucose, and other relevant parameters. With teleconsulting, it is possible to assemble specialists from every specialty along with other consultants virtually in \"one room, \"as needed by the patient. Telecardiology has been in use fordecades by means of the transmission of ECGs overtelephone lines and interpretation by cardiologists or internists. Likewise, teleradiology continues to allow practices everywhere to have access to board- certied radiologists, elevating the quality of patient care. Teleultrasound services have now beenintroduced into equine practice with increasing adoption. 13Teledermatology is uniquely suited for telemedicine as it is possible in some cases to provide accurate diagnoses and treatment recom- men-dations. Results from telepathology, telemi- croscopy, and telecytology have been shown to be in agreement with conventional methods, even exceeding them in some cases. Teleophthalmology is becoming more achievable with development of tech- nologies, including smartphone among colleagues. 3. Telemedicine in Veterinary Healthcare Veterinary telemedicine has been following in the wake of human healthcare. The global veterinary telehealth market size was valued at $92 million in 2020 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 19.5% from 2021 to 2028, with a pre- dicted revenue forecast for veterinary telehealth in 2028 of $417.1 million.15Whether recognized or not, telemedicine is already an important pillar of nearly all equine practices, from large referral centers to ru- ral practices. Telemedicine is working. While the in-person physical examination will never be replaced, and should not be, telemedicine is an essential compo- nent of the fact, telemedicine additional \"touch points\" with both clientele and patients. Telemedicine can offer insights that augment a single in-person visit. Responsible virtualBUSINESS OF PRACTICE: LEVERAGE THE TALENT OF YOUR TEAM 370 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSexamination, diagnosis, and consultation, when appropriate, can be legally and effectively incorpo- rated into practice. Another bene t of telemedicine is that it can be useful as an alternative or temporary substitute for in-person visits that need to becancelled. Telemedicine is being used in equine med-icine for an abundance of problems, such as basic tri-age, dermatology cases, lameness, minor lacerations,colic, basic ophthalmology, progress checks, postoper-ative follow-up, and long-term care. Telemedicinewith video allows the veterinarian to visit the prem-ises virtually with the potential to enhance the exami-nation by observing the horse in its own environment,other animals, grain, hay, feed storage, facilities, levelof management, and more. Telemedicine allowsaccess by practitioners synchronously or asynchro-nously, as the case indicates. Using equine lamenessas an example, much valuable information can beobtained virtually. The complete medical historycan be recorded and added to the existing medical record. Still images and videos can be transmitted to the veterinarian by the owner, the trainer, or poten-tially a veterinary technician. With real-time video,such as Zoom, the veterinarian can guide the exami-nation directly, following the American Association ofEquine Practitioners Guidelines for Evaluating theLame Horse, as far down the list as possible. Thehorse can be examined at rest, observing posture,stance, expressions of pain, weight bearing, swelling,wounds, visible foreign bodies, etc. In motion, videocan capture the horse as it walks and trots towardand away from the camera, laterally to the camera,longeing both directions, and under saddle performingits routine exercise tasks. Depending upon the ex-pertise and reliability of the owner or trainer, watch-ing the horse 's response to focal manual palpation, hoof testers, and flexion tests is possible. While more de nitive diagnostic tests, like nerve blocks and imaging, cannot be performed virtually, sound judg-ments can be made about whether the horse musthave an in-person examination, and especially howurgent that examination should be. The severity ofthe lameness and how many limbs are involved canbe assessed. In some cases, treatment can be recom-mended with a well-calculated follow-up plan fortreatment and further assessment. One examplemight be a horse with sudden onset of unilaterallameness soon after shoeing that is positive to hooftesters over one nail and shows no other ab-normalities. In such a case, the farrier might becalled to check the shoe, in which case the veterinar-ian and farrier can communicate and the follow-upplan determined accordingly. Other horses may beobvious as urgent cases needing immediate attention,whether on the farm or in the hospital. One instancewould be a horse displaying signs of a classic grade-IVlaminitis. Another would be a non-weight bearing lameness consistent with a severe injury, like fracture. Ruptured tendons could be suspectedbecause of local swelling and potentially hyper-extension of joints supported by affected flexortendons. The amount of swelling and pain associ-ated with cellulitis are observable by video, especially the excessive pain response to touch. Obvious mus- cle atrophy will raise suspicion of a neurologiccondition. In each telemedicine case, the veterinar-ian gleans important information that guides nextsteps, including emergency in-person visits. Inequine practice, rural settings are common, validatingal o o ka tt h eb e n e ts of telemedicine in human healthcare in rural communities, where telemedicinehas been shown to be invaluable. The results areimproved patient care, patients seeing more special-ists with shorter wait times, reduced costs and timerequired, increased physician utilization, and 100%positive feedback from patients. All these bene ts a p p l yt oe q u i n ep r a c t i c e . J u s t i ably, equine teleme- dicine has been referred to as the \"new farm call. \" Additionally, telemedicine can help address the chal-lenges associated with lack of access to adequate veteri-nary care in rural communities, especially considering minimal availability of veterinarians concentrating on equine medicine. Some practices have taken advant-age of a model in which a central hospital is supportedby outposts in surrounding communities that are vis-ited on a regular basis. Telemedicine allows these dis-tant communities to be served daily with moreconsistency than without telemedicine. Even whenmixed-animal veterinarians are located in rural com-munities, through telemedicine, they have constantaccess to the best equine-only veterinarians and spe-cialists, as needed. Challenges of access to care per-tain to more than just rural communities. There arenumerous circumstances in which horses cannot betransported to a hospital or clinic, as there are forveterinarians not able to make the trip to thehorse. Veterinary technicians can extend the reach ofthe veterinarian through telemedicine, dependingupon the varying regulations \u2014for example, the de ni- tions of direct supervision. Hopefully, veterinary tech-nicians will be able to be better leveraged intelemedicine services in the future. Monetization oftelemedicine can bene tt h e nancial health of a prac- tice and requires a plan for protocols, just as with in-person visits, that are individualized for the practiceand/or for its veterinarians. The rst step is estab- lishing a de ned price structure that includes speci c fees for telemedicine examinations. Some recommendsetting the telemedicine examination fee equal or com-parable to an in-person examination, the latter ofwhich can be waived if the telemedicine examinationresults in a clinic visit for that problem. Othersreduce the fee for a telemedicine examination becauset h er e d u c e df e ec a nb ej u s t i ed when the telemedicine examination is more time ef cient than in person; how- ever, telemedicine can add a layer of time commitmentfor communications, billing, etc. One must also takeinto account client convenience and minimizing stress for the patient. The practice will have to determine how it wants to collect payment \u2014for example, credit card, existing online payment programs, credit, etc. \u2014 in the most secure manner. An essential component BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: LEVERAGE THE TALENT OF YOUR TEAM AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 371of the introduction of fees for telemedicine is a robust customer awareness campaign. Clients must be informed of the transition not only to providing tele- medicine services in the practice but also to requiringpayment for these telemedicine services. Proactivecommunication and transparency are key. At thetime of scheduling a telemedicine visit, clients can begently reminded of the fees while they are assuredthat telemedicine meets standards of care and theresults are part of the horse 's permanent medical record. Marketing materials can highlight bene ts of telemedicine, including its ful llment of standards of care. When properly explained, most clients willaccept these fees, especially when they understandthe bene ts. The capabilities of virtual examination will expand in concert with the conception andrenement of new technologies. Digital radiology has opened the door widely for teleradiology, withconsequent creation of new job opport-unities.Teleradiologists can work from any location with vast work schedule options. Digital ultrasound offers comparable options for teleultrasound,including remote teleguidance a(remote ultra- sound real-time remote viewing and imageoptimization. This can be used for remote consul-tation as well as education and coaching regard-less of the operator 's global location. Tele- cardiology services have been in place for manyyears for veterinarians. Today, personal smart-phone ECG monitoring devices are used in humanhealthcare that allow a medical grade ECG any-time, anywhere, and at an affordable price(AliveCor 's KardiaMobile). Eko Duo is a combi- nation ECG and digital stethoscope that is poweredby arti cial intelligence; Eko has also developed a similar digital stethoscope for veterinarians.Smartphone-based portable ECG devices are cur- rently under development for horses. PonyUp Technologies provides monitoring devices for horses,such as VetCheq, which remotely and noninvasivelymeasures pulse, respiration, and venous pres-sure with Bluetooth technology. For teleneurology,an ambulatory electroencephalogram system is in pro-gress for horses with promising results. 16Tytocare allows a full examination at home with physiciansable to hear heart and lung sounds, conduct earexams, see the throat, and receive examinationresults by secure e-mail. In-home diagnostic kits areflourishing in human healthcare to test for COVID- 19, human papilloma virus, HIV, trichomonas, choles-terol, thyroid hormones, allergies, food sensitivities,colon cancer, heavy metals, and more. Zoetis offers astall-side test for equine in flammation and TargetVet has stall-side equine progesterone andIgG tests. VetGuardian has developed the rst zero- touch monitoring device for veterinarians that meas- ures vital signs accessible by a smartphone. Imagine the bene t to horses, clients, and the veterinary healthcare team when these technologies can beintegrated. Conversations within the professionabout telemedicine almost always include opinionsabout the veterinary client-patient relationship (VCPR). In human healthcare, regulations regard- ing telemedicine continue to evolve, as they are in vet-erinary healthcare. Today, all states, except one,allow virtual creation of the physician-patientrelationship. While the regulatory trajectory for vet-erinary telemedicine lags behind human telemedicine,there are recent notable changes in veterinaryregulations. Michigan and New Jersey just passedlegislation to allow a telemedicine VCPR to be est-ablished virtually under the judgment of theveterinarian. The American Association of Veteri-nary State Boards (AAVSB) established guidelines fortelemedicine as a model for state boards. Their lan-guage reads, \"The veterinarian must employ sound professional judgment to determine whether usingtelehealth is suitable each time veterinary servicesare provided and only furnish medical advice or treat-ment via telemedicine when it is medically ap- propriate. A veterinarian using telemedicine must take appropriate steps to establish the VCPR, obtaininformed consent from the client, and conduct all nec-essary patient evaluations consistent with currentlyacceptable standards of care. Some patient presen-tations are appropriate for the utilization of telemedi-cine as a component of, or in lieu of, hands-on medicalcare, while others are not. \"In other words, the veteri- narian 's judgment should be the determining factor. This language supports the notion that veter-inarians are intelligent, compassionate, and devotedto their patients. As such, they should be trusted todetermine when a VCPR can be formed remotely andwhen it cannot; most certainly, remote establishmentof a VCPR is not always appropriate. Those whooppose the remote establishment of the VCPR offerconcerns surrounding the differences between humanand veterinary healthcare, including diverse species, unique health risks for owners, dissimilar payment models, and disparate regulations regarding pharma-ceuticals and products. As veterinarians use theVCPR, whether remote or in person, they must beespecially mindful of the Animal Medicinal Drug UseClarication Act (AMDUCA), which provides veteri- narians acting within the VCPR greater prescribingand dispensing options so animals can receive themedications they need when they need them. It iscritical that any relaxed regulations about the VCPRmust not create concerns that could jeopardizeAMDUCA. One point of consideration is that theAMDUCA requirements for an established VCPRwere established long before virtual creation of aVCPR was being contemplated. Conversations withappropriate federal agencies will be necessary toclarify. COVID-19 provided the ultimate experimentfor virtual establishment of the VCPR as it acceler-ated telemedicine in both human and veterinary medicine. State medical regulatory agencies reset many of the barriers to entry for telemedicine, andthe experiment has proven bene cial for all. The Veterinary Virtual Care Association (VVCA)BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: LEVERAGE THE TALENT OF YOUR TEAM 372 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGScontacted the veterinary medical state boards in those states in which the telemedicine regulations were relaxed to determine if any adverse events were at- tributable to telemedicine. To date, documentedcomplaints related to telemedicine are essentiallynonexistent. The VVCA has also remained in closecontact with those in Ontario, where the creation ofthe VCPR through telemedicine was legalized in2018. The Ontario VMA has been conducting surveyssince COVID-19 forced them to restrict in-personvisits. Within 2 months, 90% of veterinarians wereusing telemedicine. When restrictions were relaxed,> 80% of veterinarians continued to use tele-medicine. Their veterinary medical governing boardhas received zero complaints related to tele-medicine. As such, concerns related to the relaxationof the VCPR (and other regulations) seem unfounded,as do concerns about long-term acceptance of virtualcreation of the VCPR. When considering and imple-menting telemedicine into a practice, valid concerns must be considered. The VVCA recently completed a survey asking the top reasons why practitioners werehesitant to implement virtual care in their practices.Regulatory/legal concerns ranked number 1. Otherconcerns were clients, technology, and staff. All ofthese can be addressed effectively. Additionally, thereare good indicators that clients are willing to pay forvirtual services. The value of hands-on examinationmust never be ignored. Fear of misdiagnosis andliability are trepidations for some, yet others feel theyare similar to in-person visits. Communicating viatechnology is different from face-to-face communica-tions, necessitating preparation and perhaps additionaltraining to be most effective in exchanging informationeffectively with the appropriate level of compassionand personal touch, which can be achieved.Monetization of telemedicine can be imposing but isaccomplishable and generates pro ts. While tech- nologies are considered assets, they also havelimitations. Internet access can be inconsistent,especially in areas with the greatest need. Some vet-erinarians are apprehensive about the time commit-ment of implementing telemedicine into a practiceand have related questions about transition require-ments, alteration of work flow, re-quired staf ng, cli- ent acceptance, and ultimate cost-bene tr a t i o . S o m e have become secure with their current practice modeland are reluctant to change. Because younger gen-erations are more comfortable with technologiesand have high expectations for their use, multiplegenerations in the practice can impose issuesrelated to differing expectations for modernization,technology use, telemedicine, etc. State regula-tions can be restrictive and most certainly lack con-sistency nationwide. The VVCA was created in2020 to provide valuable resources to veterinarianswhile ensuring that virtual care becomes a part of the standard of care by advocating best practices for veterinary healthcare providers. These bestpractices are under constant revision and can befound on the website at https://vvca.org. Some ofthe website features contain a quick-start guide, guidelines for telehealth, best practices for teleme-dicine, best practices for legal and ethical issues, a client consent form, work flows and decision trees, a front-desk phone guide, blogs, videos, and cur- rent newsworthy items. Comparative policies of the American Veterinary Medical Association, American Association of Veterinary State Boards, and Veterinary Innovation Council feature organi- zational views. A very useful tool is the con-stantly updated veterinary telemedicine re- gulatory map showing current regulations for each state. Increasing access to veterinary healthcareis a core responsibility for all in the profession. By effectively leveraging simple technology, practices can signi cantly improve patient outcomes (earlier diagnosis and treatment), owner compliance, client satisfaction, and loyalty. Telemedicine can increase the time ef ciency and productivity for the practitioner. An additional revenue stream iscaptured, while reduced cost to clients in somecases and improved access to care and improved outcomes and satisfaction for all stakeholders can be realized. Telemedicine is not meant to replacethe in-person patient exam, and in many cases it cannot. It may, however, allow a triage for those cases to determine and schedule an in-person vet-erinarian visit, when indicated; in fact, it has been shown that telemedicine stimulates substantially more hospital and in-clinic visits. Veterinarians historically have given away many of their services while powerlessly watching a number of revenuestreams be stripped away. Telemedicine offers a viable path to monetize their valuable services, recapture some lost revenues, and do so by leverag-ing their medical training and that of their profes- sional staff. In the end, veterinarians have the option to choose telemedicine, and if they do notwant to offer telemedicine services, they should not; however, new associates may seek practices that use telemedicine. If animal owners do not like telemedicine, they will not use it; however, if they do like it, they will nd a practice that offers it. An essential point is that telemedicine will not turn good veterinarians into bad veterinarians. It has been said that technologies will not replacedoctors/veterinarians, except those who do not use them. Telemedicine is here to stay; can be lever- aged to bene t the patient, client, veterinarian, staff, and practice; and can contribute to veterinar- ians being better caregivers to the animals to which they have dedicated their lives. 4. Recommendations 1. To get started, seek resources such as TeleMed Best Practices, Legal and EthicalIssues; sample client consent forms, front-desk phone guides, and prescribing medica- tions; as well as sample telemedicine flow charts that can be found on the VVCABUSINESS OF PRACTICE: LEVERAGE THE TALENT OF YOUR TEAM AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 373website. Also, ask for advice from colleagues who have successfully integrated telemedicineinto their practices and learn from continuingeducation offerings. 2. Thorough and updated knowledge of your individual state regulatory landscape is fun-damental in planning and implementing a tel-ehealth program in your practice. TheVVCA has a regulatory resource map where your state can be selected and updated regula- tions for veterinarians are accessible. Onceyou are familiar with what is and what is notallowed in your state, you can create a road-map for your practice. See the resourceguides from the AAVSB regarding VetTeleMed where you practice. 3. Determine the most appropriate inclusion of staff in offering telemedicine services in yourpractice, e.g., veterinarians, veterinary tech-nicians, front-of ce staff, billing of ce, prac- tice managers, etc. Engage them all incrafting a workable plan that is most likely tobe well received and successfully adopted. 4. Provide training as necessary for the practice as a whole and for individuals involved in differentaspects of your telemedicine services. One example is communications training to ensure that communications via technologies conveythe practice culture desired. Another is theindividual roles and responsibilities with seam-less incorporation of each 24/7. 5. Plan on the structure inside your practice for managing calls, veterinarian 'sr e s p o n s e , scheduling, billing, medical record entry, etc. as well as an evaluation of charges/ value for telehealth \u2014time base (10 minutes vs. 60 minutes), by the job (prepurchase ra-diograph evaluation), etc. 6. Establish and maintain policies and proce- dures for medical records generated throughtelemedicine. This includes the secure trans-mission of records. Create an integrationpathway to link your existing medical record program to your telehealth records or explore add-on programs available to facilitate andstreamline that process. Ensure con den- tiality of telemedicine records. 7. Implement practices to maximize cybersecurity and minimize cybercrime regarding medicalrecords and data management. This applies toall practice information, not just telemedicine. 8. If a platform vendor is preferred, ask many questions before signing on, such as their level of con dentiality, the extent of their in- surance coverage, how they manage and use their data, etc. 9. Ensure that connectivity, equipment, and processes are working and then double-checkthem frequently. Obtain client and stafffeedback to continually improve processes.10. Inform your malpractice insurance provider of the inclusion of telemedicine practices in your practice and obtain con rmation that they are covered. 11. Evaluate how much and what type of telemedi- cine you are currently providing, e.g., triage, rechecks, telemonitoring, remote diagnosis,etc. Determine the value to the practice ofeach. Also, evaluate what circumstances havebeen gratis, what circumstances should be/should have been billed, and what the value ofthose services is. What questions can beanswered by staff or should be answered by aveterinarian? What is \"good will for a great cli- ent\"as these and many others are certainly individual for different clients and different practices? Many of us have a history of under- valuing the worth of our time and expertise aswell as underestimating the willingness to payof many of our clients. There are circumstan-ces in which friends seek advice from colleaguesas they do not want to bother their own veteri-narian/friend, knowing they would not be billedby them; they want to pay a veterinarian sothey could ask more questions. 12. De ne the possibilities and limitations of remote diagnosis in your practice. 13. Obtain written client consent before the tele- medicine visit. The VVCA offers a list of con-cepts to be included in this form. 14. Educate clients about the option of telehealth for their horses and its many bene ts. Obtain client feedback as many will have already experi-enced telemedicine for their own health-care. Early engagement of clients will set upthe expectation for charges, as well as the gentle nudge for \"the value of a veterinarian 'st i m e . \" 15. Add telehealth promotion and education to your existing market plan to increase aware- ness that your practice offers this service inthe continuum of care practice paradigm.

Introduction The objective of this outline is to discuss emerging rehabilitative approaches used in elite human ath-letes, provide an overview of the research support-ing their translational use, and discuss how their incorporation may apply to the equine athlete. This review follows in two sections: (A)nonoperative strategies (for use in athletes insome level of active competition or training) and(B) pre- and postoperative strategies (prehabilita-tion and rehabilitation for the surgical patienttransitioning out of and then back into athleticworkload). Appropriate incorporation of any mo-dality or therapeutic exercise into a successfulrehabilitation program relies on an accuratediagnosis. Unfortunately, universal recommen-dations regarding the timing, frequency, and spe-cic indications of many of the below-described modalities are still lacking. As further researchi sa b l et od e ne speci c parameters, signi cant advancements within the rehabilitation eld can be expected.2. Translational Nonoperative Strategies Objectively Assessing Athletic Workload Accurately determining the balance between appro- priate training rigors and recovery to strategize thetiming of peak athletic performance while mitigatingrisk of injury is an active area of research in humanathletics. 1,2This careful equilibrium not only affects in-season management, but also subsequent contractnegotiation and television rights in professional human athletes. Speci cally, the distinction between \"overtraining \"and \"overreaching \"has been investigated in relation to acute fatigue and markers of decreased performance.1By de nition, \"overtrain- ing\"encompasses an accumulation of training result- ing in long-term decreases in performance capacitywhich may take several weeks or months to restore.1 In contrast, \"overreaching\" refers to an accumulation of training resulting in short-term decreases in per-formance, which may take several days to severalweeks to resolve. 1Although the interplay between the two scenarios remains unclear, it is thought that over-reaching precedes overtraining in a continuum of NOTES 376 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: FRONTIERS IN ATHLETIC REHABILITATIONsymptoms. Currently implicated physiologic bio- markers associated with altered (positive and nega- tive) exercise performance include muscle oxidative capacity, hormonal and immune measures such asneutrophils, glutamine, urea, and testosterone:cortisolratios. 3Wearable tness tracking technology and so- phisticated motion analysis software systems havealso been developed to aide in early recognition ofphysiologic fatigue indicators (heart rate, gait param- eters, for example) to further guide judicious exercise prescription. The use of Global Positioning System(GPS) technology in team sports to assess player posi-tion, velocity, and movement patterns has become integrated at the professional level with authors not- ing an improved ability to regulate training loads forindividual athletes at crucial times of the training sea-son. 4Incorporation of such technology has even helped improve detection of signs of injury, fatigueand overtraining as injury-prediction models havecontinued to emerge. 4,5On-body technology, however, is still considered new and evolving with simultane-ous incorporation of live motion analysis described asthe future iteration. 4 Similarly, objective tracking performance devices to assess physiologic workload parameters have been recently developed for use in the equine athlete.6,7A recent investigation evaluated a three-axis accelerom- eter at three anatomic locations to determine accuracyin detecting step count and threshold acceleration val- ues for the walk, trot, and canter.6Although equine- specic metrics to aide in interpretation of real-time data acquisition are still largely lacking, technologyincorporation of such sensor use into mainstream clini- cal practice is expected to broaden preventative effortsassociated with training fatigue. 7Interdisciplinary integration into equine competition and training strat- egies would be facilitated by de ning inherent individ- ual variability associated with an equine athlete falling outside of \"its own optimal window, \"7thus sol- idifying individualistic approaches to maximize data interpretation that have been incorporated with human use. The utilization of validated sensorsystems to record accurate data, followed by determin- ing the clinical signi cance of select measured output in horses will be the key to successful application. Blood Flow Restriction Training Low load exercise training with blood flow restriction (BFR) has become increasingly used by human physi-cal therapists to prescribe controlled exercise follow-ing orthopedic injury. 8Through application of a specialized tourniquet to temporarily reduce bloodflow to an exercising limb (Fig. 1), patients are able to increase strength and muscular hypertrophy usingonly light weights or low-intensity exercise (cyclingor walking). 9In essence, BFR is being used to increase strength via low intensity training to a leveltypically only achieved with mid to high intensitytraining. Patients with a variety of physical limita-tions are able to safely perform BFR to improve musclestrength while protecting fragile, healing tissue fromexcessive loading that occurs during traditional exerciseprograms, thus improving physical function. 10,11Blood flow restriction training is being safely used as a pro- gressive clinical rehabilitation tool in the process ofreturn to heavy-load exercise for a variety of human conditions including knee osteoarthritis, soft tissue inju- ries and geriatric sarcopenia.10-12The most consistently documented therapeutic bene ts of BFR within the human literature are muscular hypertrophy and subse-quent increases in strength secondary to elevated levelsof growth hormone (GH). 13,14The metabolic accumula- tion of GH has been demonstrated to reach supraphy-siologic levels (290 times that of baseline) duringhuman BFR training and is thought to be the main ac-tivator of resultant muscular hypertrophy. 13,14Also noteworthy is that the use of patient-speci c BFR occlu- sion pressures have become the standard of care inhuman practice due to improved comfort and mini-mized safety risks. 15 Although numerous studies have been performed validating human BFR use with compelling results,investigations to assess equine-speci c application are considerably sparse.16,17An initial pilot study Fig. 1.

Its equine applications are of current research interest. Human BFR photos courtesy of Dr. Brian Noehren.

Authors noted that extensor and flexor mus- cle thickness was increased in the occluded limb, butnot the control limb. Authors concluded that acutevascular occlusion may be safe and tolerable in horses. 16Subsequently, the same research group con- rmed that horses would tolerate BFR at a walk pace.17Six un t Standardbred mares performed BFR of both forelimbs at a walk pace with 200 -230 mm Hg cuff pressure once per day, 6 days per week for a total of 2 weeks. Skeletal muscle thickness and tendonthickness were assessed ultrasonographically and se- rum growth hormone (GH) concentrations were deter- mined 5, 15, and 60 min following BFR exercisesessions. Authors con rmed that similar to humans, BFR use in horses resulted in elevations in GH andmuscular hypertrophy. In contrast to the use ofblanket occlusion methodology in the aforementioned equine investigations, a recent study describes short- term bene cial effects of BFR on equine super cial digital flexor (SDF) muscle oxidative capacity over a 10-day study period using BFR pressures based on daily readings. 18Speci cally, SDF muscle oxidative capacity increases were consistent with acute meta- bolic adaptations of increased mitochondrial density and an improved ability to oxidize fuels.18Other com- monly used rehabilitation modalities such as under- water treadmill and conventional treadmill exercise, however, have failed to affect SDF muscle metabolic responses over four- and eight-week time periods,19,20 suggesting that neither modality alone increases mus- cle oxidative capacity to the same extent as other forms of resistance training.21 Equine athletes competing with chronic injuries, recovering from orthopedic procedures and geriatric horses all represent patients with physiologic limita- tions to consider when prescribing exercise andstrengthening programs. Blood flow restriction training may represent a strategy to optimize equine neuromuscular adaptations during extended recovery periods, but BFR cuff placement and type of exerciseused thereafter is a signi cant application difference between humans and horses (Fig. 1). Despite thesedifferences, however, BFR may represent a novel,medication-free bio-solution to consider in the process of return to heavy-load exercise. Its titrated use under trained professionals may augment historicexercise prescription currently limited by the presence of fragile, healing tissue and the inability to predict spontaneous overexertion in the horse. Ongoinginvestigations are expected that may further re ne recommended use and safe practices for use in horses. Contrast Therapy Contrast therapy is de ned as the application of alter- nating cycles of both cold and heat in a repeatedmanner with the goal of increasing blood circulation through cyclic vasoconstriction and vasodilation.22,23 Optimal skin tissue temperatures in humans havebeen documented to be 10-15\u00b0C for cryotherapy and 38-43\u00b0C for heat application. 23,24As i g n i cant body of work exists within human literature investigating the effects of contrast water therapy on postexercise re-covery outcomes, with con flicting results. 25,26Re- cently, when the effectiveness of various methods of10-minute thermal therapy (cold water immersion at10\u00b0C, thermoneutral water immersion 24\u00b0C andcontrast water therapy alternating at 10\u00b0 and 38\u00b0C) were compared using physical and mental perform- ance measures and physiological responses, the self-perceived feeling of relaxation after 6-min recoverywas signi cantly better after cold water immersion and contrast water therapy, leading authors to con-clude it may play a positive role in athletes' perform- ance and overall well-being. 2In contrast, previous work has not documented improvements in strength and sprint performance after contrast water therapy compared to passive recovery alone.25,26Despite con- flicting results, contrast therapy is being increasingly utilized by professional athletes to augment recovery strategies. Contrast therapy has technically always been available for use in the equine athlete, but his-toric focus has largely been on the effects of cryo-therapy and super cial heating modalities used inde- pendently, 27-30and rehabilitation remains largely unknown.22Recently, tissue tempera- tures at different tissue depths relative to the digitalflexor tendons as assessed by thermistor placement during serial heating and cooling cycles using ahuman contrast therapy device awas found to consis- tently induce therapeutic cooling ( <15\u00b0C) and heating (>40\u00b0C) of tissues to the depth of the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT).22Interestingly, target tissues at the skin were reached within 9.5 min when heat was applied rst but required up to 12.5 min when cold was initially applied.22Also noteworthy is that in the majority of limbs, tissues deep to the DDFT didnot reach target tissue temperatures during the 15-min heating or cooling cycles, 22obviating the temperate. hypothesized that a countercurrent temperature mechanism played a rolein the inability to heat or cool tissues deeper than theD D F Tc o m p a r e dt om o r es u p e r cial tissue. 22 Application of cold or hot thermal therapy through icepacks, water immersion, heat packs, heated blankets,etc. has certainly always been physically available tothe equine clinician but having a commercially avail- able dry-interface system that can reliably and consis- tently induce therapeutic tissue changes to a knowntissue depth is certainly of value, with the next logicalinvestigative step being to evaluate contrast therapy 's clinical ef cacy in injured tissues. Continued efforts to expand knowledge around contrast therapy 'se fca- cious use can be expected.IN-DEPTH: FRONTIERS IN ATHLETIC REHABILITATION 378 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSAdvances in Compression Technology Recovery acceleration through the use of various reha- bilitative strategies including stretching, massage, compression garments and combinations of the afore- mentioned are being increasingly used in human ath- letes to minimize days out of competition and speed active recovery.31Accelerating lymph circulation has been demonstrated to bene cially remove metabolic products, improve body fluid dynamics, cause changes in microcirculation and reduce venous blood re-turn.32-34Various methods of improving human lym- phatic flow include the use of mechanical stimulation, deep oscillation, and physical stimulation35but reported methodology is so varied that universal clini-cal practice guidelines for use in sports medicine and rehabilitation are lacking.36Nonetheless, integration of manual lymphatic drainage techniques along-side conventional rehabilitation therapies has become a mainstay of athletic physical therapy programs. Similarly, lymphatic compression technology available for use in the equine athlete includes both full and distal limb systems (Fig.2). Although the use of compression wrapping has been in use and well tolerated by horses for decades, recent noteworthy advances include the incorporation of full limb, human-grade pneu- matic compression technology bwith automatic cy- cling that works to dynamically push lymphaticfluid retrograde in between cycles. This product shares the same manufacturer and pump systemas the FDA approved human device cand is cur- rently being investigated for the treatment of lym-p h a n g i t i sa sw e l la sf o ra t h l e t i cr e c o v e r y .dDistal limb compression wraps using medical-grade ban-dages custom- t based on anatomic measure- mentsealso an avenue through which distal to proximal pressure gradients can be maintained based on the contour of an individual horse 's limb. Such systems when combined with con- trast therapy, appropriate exercise, retrograde mas-sage and titrated, supervised application haveresulted in signi cant clinical improvements of chronic distal limb edema/lymphedema based on serial, cir- cumferential limb measurements.fWith continued investigation of speci c application parameters and correlation to performance outcome measures, further recommendations can be expected.37 3. Translational Pre- and Postoperative Strategies Preoperative Management to Maximize Postoperative Results (Prehabilitation) There is considerable interest in determining if the use of prehabilitation (receiving physical therapy before a human patient undergoes surgery) results in better outcomes. By performing rehabilitation before s u r g e r y ,t h eg o a li st oh e l pt h ep a t i e n tb em o r ep r e - pared for the period of postoperative care that is char- acterized by limited physical activity, immobility, andreduced function.38The majority of the research on the effectiveness of prehabilitation in humans hascentered around anterior cruciate ligament injuries (ACL) of the knee. Because of the acute nature of the injury, there is debate as to whether it is bet- ter to quickly reconstruct the ACL or wait for a pe- riod of time for the resolution of swelling, limitedknee motion, pain, and muscle strength in- hibition. Programs to prepare the human athlete for surgery through a physical therapy program involve several components. First is aggressive management of swelling or edema around the knee. This component of care is considered criti- cal as swelling results in muscle inhibition, limitsrange of motion, and contributes to feelings of instability. However, the focus cannot entirely be on reducing swelling as the clinician must also attempt to maximize recovery by engaging the patient in exercise that does not exacerbate swel- ling or signi cant pain. Careful consideration of balancing multiple priorities i.e., regaining strength and range of motion often means having a patient use a crutch or limit too much other physical activity. Another aspect of care that is critical to address before surgery is the incorpora- tion of exercises that focus on neuromuscular re- education. This can take the form of using elec- tric stimulation to help the athlete learn to recruita n du s et h em u s c l ea g a i n . I na d d i t i o n ,t h ea t h - lete should begin to perform exercises that excite the neuromuscular system. For ACL reconstruc- tion rehabilitation, electric stimulation is per- formed over the quadriceps muscle with the intensity as high as tolerable for the athlete set to a Biphasic or Russian stimulation. The pulse du-ration is usually on order of 250 -300 plus micro- seconds, with a pulse frequency of 50 Hz with thesubject performing a 10-s hold during the stimula- tion followed by 50 s of rest. The typical duration of this treatment is 10 min. The 10-s hold fol- lowed by 50 s of rest is done to minimize fatigue. In addition, dynamic neuromuscular Fig. 2.

Lastly, during this period of time thepatient typically engages in open chain strength-ening of the quadriceps muscle to offset any loss ofstrength due to initial inhibition. Patients willtrain for three to four sets with a weight that willresult in fatigue (i.e., failure to complete an addi-tional repetition by the end of the thirdset). Typical length of these programs is any-where from 4 weeks or in some cases 10sessions. Each session takes the physical thera-pist about 60 -90 min to complete with the patient. Several clinical trials and systematicr e v i e w sh a v eb e e nd o n et oi n v e s t i g a t et h ee f f e c to fa prehabilitation program. 39-41Seminal work by Failla et al. showed that a prehabilitation pro-gram that included perturbation training resultedin a greater percentage of athletes returning tosport and having good patient reported out-comes. 38In addition, Shaarani et al. incorpo- rated a 6-wk prehabilitation program and foundincreased single leg hop distance, better patientreported outcomes, and a trend towards a higherp e r c e n t a g eo fT y p e2m u s c l e ber expression at a 12-week postoperative follow up as compared tosubjects without prehabilitation. 39Although results of these studies are encouraging, recentresults of two systematic reviews indicate morework is needed to establish the effectiveness ofsuch programs. 40,41There remains a need for large well controlled trials to evaluate the poten-tial bene t of such programs. However, the evi- d e n c et od a t ei se n c o u r a g i n gt h a ts o m ef o r mo f prehabilitation will better prepare an athlete for their postoperative recovery. In the equineathlete, there are many important factors forprehabilitation that clinicians have started toconsider. Of critical importance, and of relevance tothe psychosocial discussion below, is the importanceofnding the optimal environment for the horse to thrive and recover in. Prior to surgery, the horseshould ideally be acclimated to prolonged periods ofstall rest as well as any bandages, garments, equip-ment, and exercises that will be used post-operatively. For very t horses accustomed to work- ing and/or turnout, stall rest can be mentally andphysically challenging to them and dangerous to boththem and their handlers. In some cases, moving thehorse from an active show or competition barn to aquiet rehabilitation barn with all horses in stalls andon similar schedules is enough to calm an anxioushorse and prevent the development of stall vices or dangerous behavior. In other cases, however, the use of long-term sedatives such as reserpine 42or tra- zodone43are needed to facilitate calm stall rest and controlled exercise. Once the proper environmenthas been achieved, there are many ways that prehabi- litation for the equine athlete can be pursued, similar to what is being done for human athletes. In theauthors 'opinion, all horses can bene t from mobility, strength building, and core stability exercises bothduring the prehabilitation period and the rehabilita- tion period. Such exercises are well described, 44,45 simple to perform, and have been proven to have an effect, particularly on increasing the cross-sectional area of the multi dus muscle.46In addition, both active and passive range of motion exercises can be used preoperatively for certain injuries, to prepare the horse for rehabilitation, and to try to limit brosis preoperatively. Such exercises may be particu- larly useful for surgeries of the tendon sheath and fetlock joint where adhesions and brosis com- monly occur. The use of electrical stimulation in equine physical therapy for muscle activation and training is being ex-plored and certainly warrants further in-vestigation. A recent study examined the use of a commercially available electrical stimulation unit FES 310gapplied using a back treatment pad over the sacral region to generate movement in the lumbosacral region of standing horses without known pathology.47The authors found that although the movement caused by the electrical stimulation was smaller than that caused by manual pelvic inclination, its effectswere documented in a wide area including the muscles of the hind limb. In addition, the authors state that electrical stimulation couldeasily be applied over a longer period and in a higher frequency than is possible for manual pel- vic inclination, providing justi cation for future studies into its use for stabilizing the sacroiliac joint and potentially for training of the quadriceps muscles. Also similar to neuromuscular re-edu- cation in human athletes is the use of propriocep- tive retraining techniques in horses. Examplesof such techniques include kinesiotaping, 48,49 tactile stimulators,50,51and more recently equine balance pads (Fig. 3).h,52 Fig. 3.

Several constructs have been considered, which include self-ef cacy, fear of re-injury, and psy- chological readiness to return to sport. Prior workhas found that a more positive assessment of self-ef - cacy,53a lower fear of re-injury,54and feelings of greater psychological readiness to return to sport55 result in higher likelihood of returning to preinjurylevels as well as reduce the risk of second injury.56In addition, there is evidence to suggest that lower psy-chological readiness to return to sport after an ACL reconstruction resulted in the human athlete having greater de cits in their running gait in the injured knee as compared to the uninjured knee.57In addi- tion, work from Beischer et al. shows that patients with higher knee self-ef cacy at 4 months after sur- gery had increased odds for symmetrical muscle func-tion at 1 year after surgery.58Clearly, psychosocial aspects of recovery are important adjuncts that mustbe considered during the recovery from surgery. How to best help and treat athletes who are not coping well with their recovery is also an area of active investigation. For athletes with signi cant postoper- ative challenges in coping with the response to injuryreferral to a sports psychologist or other mental health professional is warranted. Many athletes though do not have access to psychologists or may have an impor- tant but modest or moderate negative change in d o m a i n ss u c ha ss e l f - e f cacy and fear of re-injury and not be willing to seek care. Within those cases posi-tive supportive discussion, goal setting and engaging the athlete in the rehabilitation process are all poten- tial adjunct therapies to consider. For example, engaging the athlete for their input on what is done in the rehabilitation program on a given day may help them feel that they have control and an active voice in their recovery process. Also, careful consideration of word choice and non-verbal behavior when interacting with human athletes can communicate a lot of how the practitioner feels about their recovery that they then internalize. In regard to the equine athlete, psy- chosocial factors may be relevant to both the horse themselves as well as their caretakers, trainers, and owners. Horses can certainly become \"sour \"or resist- ant to training methods, speci c movements, or even pieces of tack that they associate with pain from aninjury. Breaking the pain cycle of an injury is imper- a t i v et oo v e r c o m et h en e g a t i v ea s s o c i a t i o n st h a ta horse has developed. In addition, some horses seem to require a temporary, or in more severe cases, per- manent change in training methods or tack for them to return from an injury and advance in their career. In the authors 'opinion, pain from the axial skeleton and especially the back, can be particularlydifcult for equine athletes to overcome in this regard. Horse caretakers and riders also commonlyhave their own fears and other psychosocial concerns. Helping caretakers and riders by using the same processes done in human athletes such that theequine athlete is perceiving that those around them are showing positive response about how they are doing is a very interesting area to explore. Althoughrider fears may be of themselves getting injured or for their career, they often also have fears or concerns that the horse might still be in pain or discomfort,even if not overtly lame. The Ridden Horse PainEthogram (RHpE) as developed and evaluated by Dyson et al. may be very useful for such riders and for v e t e r i n a r i a n sa sw e l l . 59-63In the most recent of the RHpE comprised of 24 behaviors, a RHpE score of greater than or equal to 8, meaning eight or more of the behaviors were displayed, was found to be a goodindicator of musculoskeletal pain.59 Exercise Specificity The balance between exercises that simulate or recre-ate the event the human athlete has to engage in ver-sus targeting the muscle or tissue speci cally injured is an area that continues to be debated within the physical therapy community. There is clearly a need for recreating situations that the athlete may experi-ence and training the individual neuromuscular sys-tem to respond appropriately. A series of studies by Hewett and colleagues showed, for example, that by focusing on neuromuscular training one could altermovement patterns and reduce risk for subsequent injury. 64-66Further, work by Noehren et al. shows the bene ts of programs such as gait retraining which emphasize the bene ts of directly addressing the faulty movement mechanics using real-time visual feedback to reduce pain in patients with patellofe-moral pain.67Although these individual studies are supportive of programs that focus on improving move- ment mechanics the studies were not designed to eval- uate a comprehensive program. Clinical experiencewould dictate that without suf cient underlying mus- cle strength and control, engaging in such gait re-training programs would be detrimental to re-covery. It is established, for example, that following an orthopedic injury such as an ACL tear that regain- ing quadriceps muscle strength predicts normaliza-tion of gait, function, self-reported outcomes, return to play and risk of developing post traumatic osteoar- thritis. 68-74Consequently, it is critical that as recov- ery progresses, loads increase to stimulate adequatemuscle hypertrophy. During the early phases of healing using adjuncts such as blood flow restriction training as previously discussed may be an excellent way to slow or reverse muscle atrophy during times when other tissues such as ligaments need to be pro- tected to fully heal. In addition, one can have theathlete use a lighter weight and exercise to the point of muscle fatigue to help stimulate the muscle. Only by carefully considering the underlying impairmentsand how that contributes to altered movementmechanics can one help the human athlete return to their preinjury levels of function. In addition, carefulIN-DEPTH: FRONTIERS IN ATHLETIC REHABILITATION AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 381attention to movement mechanics as the athlete pro- gresses in rehabilitation is critical to reduce risk ofreinjury and long-term complications. 4. Conclusion Novel physiotherapeutic strategies to augment heal- ing in the equine athlete are evolving, with many modalities applicable to both humans and horses.Veterinarians should defer to speci c show jurisdiction guidelines for recommended use in the actively com-peting equine athlete. Continued collaboration to de-velop, evaluate, and implement effective translationalapproaches will rede ne historic paradigms in both human and equine practice.

Introduction A complete visual oral examination should be the ba- sis of every dental visit and is a high standard ofcare. A comprehensive visual examination of thehead and oral cavity is necessary to arrive at a diagno-sis, perform appropriate treatments, and plan formanagement of challenging dental problems. Thewelfare of the horse depends on skilled and knowl-edgeable veterinarians that can characterize normaland abnormal ndings both systemically and relative to the oral cavity. Clients that observe a compre-hensive clinical dental examination of their horse will then compare it to their own dental care in a dentist 'so fce and are able to recognize the differ- ence between veterinary dentistry and impropernon-veterinary dental care. When horse ownersrecognize that dental treatments are based on medi-cal expertise and accurate diagnoses, they begin torequest exams for their horses instead of simply a\"float. \"A methodical oral and dental examination is required to diagnose diseases affecting the oralcavity. This inspection can be applied with the samedegree of objectivity as would be the case during alameness evaluation or any other body systemexamination. As with any examination, conclusionsallow the clinician to diagnose early disease as wellas identify and manage chronic problems, thusimproving quality of life and bene tting the long- term general health of the horse.2. Materials and Methods Equipment, Location, and Sedation Considerations for a Dental Examination Basic dental examination equipment is readily avail- able by numerous veterinary suppliers. Recentinstrumentation advances allow more ef ciency and ease, and modern equine dentistry does not need to becumbersome and labor intensive. The following ba-sic equipment and instrumentation list is required foran oral examination: \u0081Sedation \u0081Headstand, head support, or dental halter \u0081Large volume dosing syringe or other method to mirror -available various sizes \u0081Extended handle periodontal probe with markedmeasurements \u0081Extended handle occlusal surface explorer \u0081Right angled alligator forceps and dentalpicks to remove feed from gingival pockets NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 385HOW-TO SESSION: ADVANCING DENTISTRY FOR FIELD USES\u0081Short handle double-ended periodontal probe and explorer for incisor evaluation \u0081Forceps -incisor and molar cap extractors to test for tooth mobility \u00814/C24 gauze \u0081Disposable nitrile or latex gloves \u0081Dental chart Additional equipment that may facilitate examina- tion and recordkeeping, and ancillary diagnostics include the following: \u0081Trained technical assistant \u0081Oral endoscope \u0081Digital radiography system \u0081Stationary stocks for restraint Appropriate sedation of the patient is mandatory to complete a comprehensive visual oral examina-tion.1-3An oral examination is an invasive proce- dure to an unsedated horse. Although complianthorses may tolerate a brief examination of theirmouth when held open, and even may tolerate thespeculum, it should be noted that an unsedated horsewearing a speculum is capable of infl icting serious injury to itself and handlers. 3Following cardiac aus- cultation and physical examination, sedation isadministered to allow patient relaxation andcompliance. Muscles of mastication should berelaxed to allow speculum placement, and the tongueshould be relaxed to allow complete visualizationwithout excessive tongue motion. The author 'sp r e f - erence is cli- nician and the patient should be considered, and the use of an appropriate head support should beused. An adjustable head stand, sling, or dental hal-ter helps to stabilize the sedated patient, and allows the veterinarian to work in a comfortable position. A quiet indoor environment is best to avoid external dis-tractions to the patient and working indoors withmoderate ambient light allows better illumination ofthe oral cavity with a headlight or speculumlight. Consideration should be given to flooring, which should be level and a non-slip surface. Stocksare essential in a clinical setting for treatmentsincluding extractions, and while they are not typicallyrequired for a basic examination, they can certainlyfacilitate the process. Dental History Taking History taking helps complete the clinical picture in any medical examination and a thorough oral exam is no different. A presenting complaint of a speci cd e n - tal problem should not preclude the veterinarian from obtaining a complete dental history and performing athorough dental and physical examination. 4The gen- eral history includes information such as the patient 'ssignalment, athletic use, medical history, dietary his- tory, husbandry and environment, vices, and recent changes noted. Overall medical history such as prior response to sedation, musculoskeletal and neurologic status, cardiac abnormalities, respiratory disease, underlying renal or hepatic disease, and endocrine sta- tus all have an impact on how the horse isevaluated. Oral/dental speci c history includes prior dental treatments, feeding habits and any perceiveddifculty masticating, fecal consistency, recently noted physical abnormalities such as nasal discharge, mal-odor, or abnormal swellings, and biting history and any perceived discomfort and progression of such. Observation and General Physical Examination Observation of the animal in its normal surroundings can provide important information. Objective data about body condition can be recorded with photo- g r a p h s ,w e i g h tt a p eo rs c a l e ,a n dc a nb ev a l u a b l ei n management of patient nutrition. Abnormalities with the horse 's posture and ambulation should be observed and taken into consideration for a sedatedexamination. Dropped grain or partially chewed boluses of hay (quids) can be observed in the sta- ble environment and feces should be examined forvolume and consistency, as long forage stems or whole grain visible in feces indicate poor mastication. 5Observation of the mastication process while the horse eats several differenttypes of food can be time consuming, but it can lend important information to the examination as well as address client concerns if they havenoticed more dif culty with a particular feed or hay. It can be particularly useful to observe thehorse eating to evaluate for mastication dif cul- ties, as prehension problems look very differentfrom dysphagia. It is important to remember that the horse as a whole should be taken into con- sideration when being evaluated for dental disease. Oral health is impacted by systemic health and systemic health plays a role in oralhealth, and the two must be considered collec- tively in order to make an effective treatment or management plan. 1,6 Comprehensive Oral and Dental Examination Routine comprehensive examinations, beginning with an oral examination at birth for congenital abnormal- ities, should be performed at an interval that allows for detection and treatment of problems while theyare still minor. For most horses, this will be every 6-12 months depending upon their eruption and de- velopment of dental problems as they age. Theappropriate schedule is variable between individual horses and will be affected by variables such as their own anatomy, use of the horse, stage of development and oral conditions present or developing, and previ-ous treatments performed. 1,7 For complete evaluation of all oral/dental structures the comprehensive dental examination needs to beHOW-TO SESSION: ADVANCING DENTISTRY FOR FIELD USES 386 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSsystematic and organized (Table 1). Extraoral exam- ination is completed rst, followed by examination of occlusion, soft tissues, periodontal status, and endo- dontic status for both the rostral oral cavity (incisors and canines) and then the caudal oral cavity (includ-ing premolars and molars). Exam speci cs will be outlined in this manner as this is how the author per- forms a dental exam. The reader should develop theirown methodical approach to completing the oral examto include the components outlined here. Performing a methodical examination will reduce the chances of failing to identify abnormalities so that the veterinar-ian can ensure that all aspects of oral health are assessed and then apply those ndings to reach a di- agnosis and treatment or management plan. Extraoral Examination The dental examination begins with an external vis- ual inspection and palpation of the structures of the head for evaluation of the following: \u0081Skull symmetry, conformation, shape: The ears, eyes, facial crests, musculature, nasal bones, and muzzle should be symmetrical. Breed differences and head conformation may pre-dispose to certain dental concerns, andawareness will aid the practitioner inapproaching the dental case. \u0081Bony enlargements, thickening, or depressionsinvolving the maxillary region and the mandible: G r o s sa b n o r m a l i t i e ss u c ha st h e s ew i t hh e a t , swelling, or associated with a draining tract mayindicate apical infection if unilateral in nature. \u0081Symmetry of muscles of mastication: Temp-oralis, masseter, and pterygoid or hypertrophy. \u0081Temporomandibular joints (TMJ): These shouldbe bilaterally symmetrical, of effusion, andnonpainful on palpation. There will be individ-ual variation, but the practitioner should acquirea sense of normal TMJs to be able to recognizeabnormal \u0081Parotid should be palpated for enlargement andsymmetry. \u0081Nasal air flow, odor, or discharge: Air flow should be symmetrical from each nostril, andodor from each side should be assessed. Nasaldischarge should be assessed for character, con-sistency, volume, and odor. Dental sinusitistypically presents as a fetid unilateral muco- purulent discharge. If a noxious odor or dis- charge from one side is present, the practitionershould plan to evaluate the maxillary dentitionmeticulously visually on that side for indica-tions of disease. \u0081Ocular structures: Orbital structure, eyes andeyelids should be symmetrical, clear, and free ofdischarge. \u0081Discharging tracts or nonhealing structuresor mandibular rami should be assessed as thesetypically will have a dental or traumatic origin. \u0081Muzzle and lips: These should be evaluated forswelling, wounds, or masses. The commis-sures of the lips are common places to nd scars or ulcers from bit injuries, as well asTable 1.

Muzzle deviation to one side can indicate neurologic abnormal- ities secondary to temporohyoid osteopathy (THO) that should be assessed prior to any sig- nicant dental procedures.8-10 Intraoral Examination The intraoral examination includes evaluation of occlusion, oral soft tissues, periodontal, and endodon- tic status of all dentition. It is helpful to separatethe intraoral examination into two parts: the rostraloral cavity including incisors and canine teeth, andthe caudal oral cavity including premolars, molars,bars, tongue, and palate. The oral cavity should be rinsed thoroughly to remove all feed material so that visualization of dental structures is not obscured,especially the dental occlusal surfaces and gingivalmargins. Complete endodontic, periodontic andinfundibular assessment requires the use of occlusaland periodontal depth probes to objectively quantify the degree and type of pathology present, this is sig- nicantly aided with appropriate lighting and sedation. Most of the rostral examination should beperformed prior to speculum placement. The inci-sors and canine teeth should be evaluated for thefollowing: \u0081Occlusion: Orthodontic status of incisors should be assessed with the horse' sh e a di nan a t u r a lp o s i - tion, not manually elevated by the examiner orassistant as this can give the false impression of maxillary prognathism (overjet). 11Rostrocaudal movement of the mandible can be evaluated byobserving the relationship between the upperand lower incisor when the chin is raised and lowered. 4When evaluating occlusion, the examiner should consider whether occlusionor malocclusion is due to a dental or skeletal abnormality or asymmetry. Incisor diagonal malocclusion has been reported to be due to skeletal asymmetry and not a primary dental malocclusion. 12 Number and alignment of incisors and canines should be assessed. Presence of diagonal or dorsal/ ventral curvature incisor malocclusion should berecorded. The dental age should be estimated and compared with the known age of the horse. The lateral excursion to molar contact test (LMC) may be used toevaluate for masticatory symmetry and suspected oralor dental pain. 4,13- 18Normal lateral excursion pro- duces a relatively even, subtle to moderate vibrationand sound. Deviations from this can be an indication of abnormal dental contact due to cheek teeth overgrowths. It must be kept in mind that this ma-neuver does not replicate the chewing motion of thehorse. If the horse resists this part of the dentalexamination, sedation may be indicated to help the horse relax and allow a more thorough visualexamination. 4 \u0081Soft tissues: Any masses, wounds, ulcers, to gingiva and mucosa free gingiva should be eval- uated for indicators of in flammation subgingi- val disease, stulae, recession, or hyperplasia. \u0081Periodontal status: A double ended periodontal probe and occlusal explorer used for small ani-mal or human dentistry is useful for incisor and canine examinations. The periodontal probe with depth markers is useful to assess degree of attachment loss, and teeth should be palpated and manipulated individually for mobilityscoring. Pain response such as chattering or resistance to probing should be recorded, heav- ily sedated horses will still show signi cant pain responses to light probing, particularlywith calculus should to accurately assess the gingival margin. \u0081Endodontic status: Canines and incisorsshould be assessed for status, trau- matic damage, resorptive lesions, and hypercementosis. Occlusal surfaces of all incisors and canines should be examined for pulp exposure and defects. Examination of the caudal oral cavity will include visual evaluation of the premolar and molar dentition and gingiva, buccal and lingual mucosa, bars, tongue,hard and palate. When the patient is appropri-ately sedated, a speculum may be applied, and the head rested on a headstand. The veterinarian equipped with a bright headlight or speculum lightcan visualize structures deep within the oral cav-ity but does need to use a dental mirror, intraoral camera, or a dental endoscope to visually examine oral and dental structures. 2If the horse is inad- equately sedated, effective examination with amirror is almost impossible. The veterinarian should practice using a mirror or endoscope with every dental examination. Although it may befrustrating at rst, skill is acquired with consist- ent practice. Occlusal and periodontal lesions will no longer be missed, and it will elevate the quality and breadth of the examination. To use amirror (or endoscope, the same general proceduremay be performed with either one) to systemati- cally evaluate all surfaces of the teeth and oral soft tissues, start with the mirror placed betweenthe right maxillary and mandibular arcades sothat the occlusal surface of 106 is re flected in the mirror. The mirror is then advanced caudally tovisualize the occlusal surface of each tooth in theHOW-TO SESSION: ADVANCING DENTISTRY FOR FIELD USES 388 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGS100 arcade. When 111 is reached, the mirror is then tipped to visualize the palatal aspect of 111, and then withdrawn rostrally to examine the palatal mucosaand interdental spaces. When 106 is reached, themirror is again advanced to distal 111 and withdrawnrostrally but tipped to visualize the buccal mucosaand vestibular interdental spaces. The same processis then repeated for the 200, 300, and 400 arcades toevaluate all aspects of each tooth in addition to sur- rounding soft tissues. 20Examination of all struc- tures should be completed in the same systematic manner as described below. \u0081Occlusion: Orthodontic assessment of premo- lars and molars is performed, including count-ing teeth in each quadrant and recognition ofgeneral wear abnormalities and focal malocclusions. Note the position of the clinical crown of each tooth and its orientation and rela-tionship to adjacent and opposing teeth. Anydefects or asymmetry in the occlusal crown sur- face in one row is usually re flected in a wear ab- normality or defect in the opposite row. Assess each quadrant of premolar and molar teeth as afunctional unit. 6 \u0081Soft tissues: Examine all oral cavity soft tissues including all surfaces of the tongue as far cau- dally as vallate papilla, lingual folds, sublingualmucosa, gingiva,mucogingival junction, and alveolar and vestibu-lar mucosa. Any masses, wounds, ulcers, or ero- sions should be noted and their association with dental structures or trauma noted. Attachedand free gingiva should be evaluated for indica-tors of in flammation and subgingival disease, s- tulae, recession or hyperplasia. Visualization and palpation of the interdental space (bars) should be performed for unerupted ( \"blind \")o r vestigial odontal probe is necessary for premolar and molar periodontal assessment. Examination may reveal halitosis, bleeding at the gingivalmargins of the teeth, pocketing and necrosis oftissues around the teeth, and loose teeth. 7If there is impacted feed or supragingival calculus in between or around the teeth, remove it entirely with long-handled oral picks or forcepsto enable accurate probing and gingivalassessment. The periodontal probe with grad- uated markings can be used to measure gingi- val pocket depth and assess degree ofperiodontal attachment, which will range from0.5 to 5 mm for normal teeth. 23It has been shown that gingival pocket depth measure- ments at the corners of the teeth signi cantly increases with periodontal disease.24,25 Diastemata width and depth, periodontal pock-eting, and interproximal space anatomy should be recorded. Teeth should be palpated and manipulated individually for mobility scoringand any pain response noted. \u0081Endodontic status: A detailed examination is performed to evaluate the physical structure of each tooth. Defects over the pulp horns on theocclusal surfaces of endodontically infected teeth can be detected by carefully probing the second- ary dentin of the occlusal surfaces of suspectteeth. 26,27A long-handled occlusal explorer is used to assess occlusal surface for abnormal sec-ondary dentin or presence of tertiary dentin, open pulp horns, ssures/defects in dentin, enamel hyper- cementosis, and peripheral caries. Infundibular status is ed Honma sys- tem of grading of occlusal caries 28 Dental Recordkeeping and Documentation Completion of a detailed dental chart and images (in- traoral photography, video, or image capture from en- doscopy) documenting examination ndings should be included to complete the medical record. Accurate records are critical for the veterinarian to be able tothoroughly follow a case, communicate with other vet- erinarians, and provide a medical/legal document if necessary. In dental charting, the dental formulaand anatomical locations in the mouth must be stand-ardized to make documentation consistent. Use of standard abbreviations 29for dental terms to describe anatomical boundaries, abnormalities, diagnostics, and therapeutic procedures make communication pos-sible between equine practitioners and other col- leagues in both the veterinary and human dental professions. 7Important information recorded in the dental chart includes the following: \u0081Horse identi cation and signalment \u0081Owner information and date and time of examination \u0081General physical exam abnormalities, vitalsigns, and body condition score \u0081Presenting complaint and case history \u0081Record of sedation and medication administration \u0081Objective ndings for extraoral and intraoral exam components including measurements taken, sketches of visible abnormalities such as fractures or focal malocclusionsHOW-TO SESSION: ADVANCING DENTISTRY FOR FIELD USES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 389Fig. 1.

Recordingimages, videos, and radiographs digitally allows theseimages to be incorporated in the computerized dentalrecord. 30-35Integration of the history and examina- tionndings with the radiologic ndings and other diagnostic procedures greatly improves the chances ofan accurate diagnosis being formed.6As a m p l ed e n t a l chart used by the author is included (Fig. 1). 3. Conclusions The thorough oral examination is the mainstay of the routine dental visit. The veterinarian must have a thorough working knowledge of gross and ultrastruc-tural anatomy of the dentition, as well as an understand-ing of the etiology and progression of dental pathologiesto understand the ndings and develop a manage- ment plan. Developing a consistent and ef cient examination procedure will allow the veterinarian toreliably diagnose pathologies in the early stages ofdevelopment. Improving the quality of the oral exami-nation will increase the quality of dental care provided to patients. It is every clinician 's responsibility to obtain the evidence and use evidence-based decision making to improve the way in which oral care is administered. 1 Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principles of the Veterinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Introduction Digital radiography has signi cantly improved the ability to diagnose dental disease in the horse. Direct digital radiography units allow diagnostic images to be readily obtained. However, practitioners may nd dif- culty in obtaining radiographs of the horse' ss k u l l that are of diagnostic quality. Familiarity with stand-ard radiographic techniques is critical to obtaining quality images and then correctly interpreting dentalradiographs. Standard radiographic projections have been described in depth in multiple publications, and these are recommended for the reader to explore addi-tional sources of information. 1-7The recommenda- tions offered in this manuscript can help the practitioner improve their skills in dental radiography, which will then improve recognition of radiographicsigns of dental and paradental pathology. 2. Materials and Methods Radiography complements but does not replace athorough visual oral examination. A detailed physi- cal examination, appropriate sedation, and complete oral and dental examinations will allow the veterinar-ian to identify abnormalities that will indicate radio- graphs as the next diagnostic step. It is the exam that identi es potential problems within an area in the mouth so that a complete imaging study can be performed and the practitioner can then focus on identifying subtle radiographic changes withthe tooth or teeth in question that were identi ed during the detailed examination. In dental refer- ral practice, the author reviews and consults on referral radiographs on a daily basis. Some of the most common problems encountered when taking dental radiographs are consistent with those previously reported. 8 \u0081Motion artifact. \u0081Exposure irregularities and image processing errors. \u0081Positioning errors and superimposition of indi-vidual teeth and arcades. \u0081Obtaining an incomplete series of radiographs of the affected arcade. \u0081Failing to image the opposite \"normal \"side. \u0081Lack of radiographic marker or incorrect orien-tation of radiographs. \u0081Lack of a complete oral exam resulting to correlate radiographic ndings to examination ndings. Profound sedation is required to help reduce motion artifact in dental radiography. The author 'sp r e - ferred intravenous administration Appropriate sedation lowers the horse 'sh e a d ,w h i c hc a nt h e n be rested on a low support, such as a stool or NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 393HOW-TO SESSION: ADVANCING DENTISTRY FOR FIELD USESheadstand. Stabilizing the radiographic sensor plate on the same support object greatly diminishes motionartifact. When imaging incisor and canine teeth via an intraoral technique, it is especially important (even if a speculum with radiolucent bite plates cis used) that sedation is adequate so that the horse is not stimulated to chew when the plate is felt in the mouth. Differences in tissue density may requiremore than one radiographic exposure; however, most digital system algorithms can be adjusted to compen- sate for variations in tissue thickness. The use of alarge (12 in /C214 in to 14 in /C217 in) sensor plate or cassette allows imaging of entire arcades, which helps to maintain spatial relationships when evaluating the radiograph. Appropriate positioning of the sensorplate and x-ray generator are necessary to obtain diagnostic images. Knowledge of skull anatomy and topographic landmarks is necessary to guidecorrect positioning of the patient 's head, sensor plate, and x-ray generator. With closed-mouth ra-diographic projections, erupted crown can beobscured by superimposition of the crowns of theopposite arcades. Superimposition is addressedby obtaining open-mouth views via use of a specu-lum or other method to open the mouth. Standardfull-mouth speculums may have too much metal later- ally that will interfere with imaging. Aluminum speculums dare more radiolucent but still produce opacity on the image. Other options to keep the m o u t ho p e ni n c l u d ea4i n/C2 4 in block of wood, a PVC pipe, or a large rubber dog chew toy.1Open-mouth lateral oblique views allow for optimal image qualityas the superimposition of contralateral cheek tooth rows is reduced or eliminated. The practitionershould become well versed at obtaining standardviews for maxillary and mandibular cheek teeth, inci- sors, canines, and sinuses. Taking a complete series of radiographs is important to allow evaluationof each tooth and the arcade as a functional unit. Limiting radiographs to one view of the arcade in question generally does not provide a diagnosis. Aminimum series of 6 standard views for the skull and cheek teeth (dorsoventral, latero-lateral, open-mouth right and left lateral 1C, 2B, 2C, 4B) is Fig. 1. Three images of the same horse with periapical lysis, blunted apices of tooth 110.

B, Open- mouth right lateral dorsal 30\u00b0 ventral oblique provides clear interproximal spacing, and the practitioner is able to evaluate mesial and dis- tal buccal roots.

A series of 6 views (bisecting angle tech- nique, dorsoventral and 15\u00b0 oblique angle to the left and right of maxillary incisors and ventrodorsal and 15\u00b0 oblique angle to the left and right of mandibularincisors; see Fig. 3B -D) is warranted to assess all rostral dentition.1Additional intraoral obliques or extraoral imaging neces-sary. The dorsoventral or ventrodorsal angulation outlined in the recommended standard lateral oblique views also may need to be adjusted depending on theage of the horse and length of reserve crown. Slight repositioning in a caudo-rostral or rostro-caudal direc- tion may also be required to eliminate obliquity and overlapping of adjacent cheek teeth. Practitioners are encouraged to image both left and right views forcomparison of the \"normal \"side to the side of interest. Bilateral images are necessary for reliableradiographic interpretation; because of the changingangles and anatomy of dentition with age, the horse serves as its own control subject. Subtle radiographic changes should be compared to the normal side to aidin radiographic diagnosis and help decision-making if referral for more advanced diagnostics, such as com- puted tomography, is indicated. In addition, radiogra-phy of both sides allows identi cation of bilateral pathology. Radiographs taken without a markermake it dif cult to know which side is which when both sides of the skull are imaged. Radiographsshould be taken with a right/left marker on the sensorindicating sensor placement. Proper labeling of the radiographs is essential for accurate inter- pretation. The American Veterinary Dental College(AVDC) convention of presenting the radiographs with \"labial mounting \"is used in conjunction with the American College of Veterinary Radiology (ACVR) ter- minology. 9Radiographs are presented so the viewer is looking at the images as if looking into the horse 's mouth. The right cheek teeth are presented with the horse 's nose on the viewer 's right. The dorsoventral views of the skull are presented with the nose down and the horse 's left side on the viewer 'sr i g h t . C r o w n s of the maxillary incisors are pointed down and mandib-u l a ri n c i s o r sa r ep o i n t e du pa si fo n ew e r es t a n d i n gi nfront of the horse. 3. Results Once appropriate diagnostic radiographs are acquired, systematic review of each radiograph taken should include assessment of the following: \u0081Is there motion artifact and is exposure appro- priate to evaluate the image? \u0081Tooth numbers and anatomy: Is the entire ar-cade included on the image? Are individual teethand roots visible with interproximal spaces andperiodontal ligament spaces clear? Are there missing teeth or supernumerary Is Fig. 3. Mandibular incisor images of the same horse.

Are ne bony struc- tures clearly visible or is the image overexposed? Critically evaluating each radiograph will help the operator improve their technique. The practitioner will become accustomed to looking for speci c changes that will lead to a diagnosis from quality images instead of guessing at nondiagnostic images. Consistency in positioning and technique improves the clinician' s ability to recognize normal and abnormal anatomy and allowsidenti cation of radiographic signs of dental and sinus disease. 10Figures 1 -4 are provided to highlight the dif- ferences between nondiagnostic and diagnostic dentalradiographs. 4. Discussion Prociency with the standard radiographic views of equine cheek teeth will allow the practitioner to obtain diagnostic images for immediate use in the eld or for consultation. Dental disease diagnosis requires quality radiographic technique that is consis-tently applied in veterinary practice. There is signif- icant age variation of radiographic appearance of cheek teeth and their apices, and an appreciation of nor-mal variations is required for accurate interpretation of dental radiographs. By recognizing and preventing ra- diographic technical dif culties, image quality and diag- nostic accuracy will improve. Becoming pro cient with taking and interpreting dental radiographs will increasethe level of service practitioners provide and thusimprove the overall health care of their patients. It isimportant to understand the limitations of radiography to clearly diagnose dental disease in complicated cases. Additional advanced imaging with computedtomography, nuclear scintigraphy, or magnetic resonance imaging may be required to better characterize the extentand exact location of disease involving multiple teeth orsinus disease.

Abattoir studies conducted during the last fty years report an overall prevalence of 13% -60%.1,3,4This is similar to results reported from more recent surveys of various patient populationsshowing a prevalence range of 13% -75%.5-9Earliest stages of PD result in gingivitis without involvement of subgingival tissues; however, as the disease progresses,periodontitis ensues with deeper extension of in flam- mation and infection into subgingival supporting structures. prac- titioner must be cognizant that periodontal diseasemanifests in various locations in the equid hypsodontdentition. A very common occurrence of PD occursdue to calculus accumulation on mandibular caninet e e t hw i t hg i n g i v i t i s( r e d n e s s ,b l e e d i n g )i nm a l eh o r s e s ,similar to PD that which occurs in dogs and cats. At the front of the mouth, gingivitis affecting the incisive region can occur due to local irritation when ingestingnoxious plant material in hay or pasture, and focal gin-givitis can also be seen in this area of the mouth duringincisor eruption. In the back of the mouth, gingivitis is often noted along the cheek teeth arcades during tooth eruption of premolars and shedding of deciduous teeth, and mild gingivitis can also be seen with oral migration of Gastrophilus sp. larvae. The aforemen- tioned conditions are typically limited to the supragin- gival region and likely cause mild to moderateirritation to the horse. Equine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis (EOTRH) is an in flam- matory process that results in signi cant periodontal disease of the incisor teeth, canine teeth, and less com- monly the cheek teeth. In these cases, gingivitis, gingival recession, enlargement and distortion of alveo- lar bone, and gum boils are frequently noted inaddition to typical radiographic lesions of EOTRH(tooth resorption lesions, alveolar bone lysis, and hypercementosis). Another of PD in equids occurs if roughage bers become wedged between adjacent cheek teeth (premolar or molar teeth). Ordinarily tight apposition of the clinical crowns eliminates the possibility of food material enter-ing the interproximal spaces; however, in some equids,a slim gap at the occlusal aspect of the interproximal space that allows entrapment of food material between teeth (the occlusal gap between the teeth is termed adiastema ,p l u r a l diastemata ). Diastemata may be congenital or acquired and in some instances have a sufcient occlusal opening allowing roughage to escape (\"open \"diastema); however, in some patients, the slim NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 397HOW-TO SESSION: ADVANCING DENTISTRY FOR FIELD USESopening acts as a one way valve to prevent release of thebrous feedstuffs ( \"valve \"diastema).11,12In this event, roughage occlusal aspect of the diastema during mastication, becomingwedged into deeper portions of the interproximal space, which leads to the pathologic cascade of PD (bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates !acid production ! inflammation !necrosis). Untreated, diastemata result in periodontitis, pain, and progressive loss oftooth attachment (Fig. 1). Potential symptoms of PD noted by animal care- takers are dependent on severity but can include hali- tosis, slow eating, frequent mouth rinsing, tilting the head when chewing, refusal to bite carrots/hard treats, quidding, or slobbering. In some instances, apatient affected with PD may present for dental proce- dures without any owner complaints of dental-related issues. As such, a thorough and systematic intraoralexamination is necessary for appropriate recognition of PD, as well as radiographic examination to evalu- ate the teeth and supporting structures. Previousauthors have reviewed periodontal anatomy exten- sively, and there is a growing abundance of research on anatomy and physiology of equine periodon- tium. 13-22In practical terms, the reserve crown and root of the hypsodont tooth are anchored within the alveolus by diffuse subgingival attachment of peri- odontal ligament along the peripheral cementum of the tooth. These attachments span from the toothacross the periodontal ligament space and attach to the inner surface of the alveolar bone. The alveolar bone encasing the tooth is very compact and forms asubgingival alveolar crest in the interproximal region of the clinical crowns. The intraoral surfaces of the attached gingiva, unattached gingival margin, clinicalcrowns, and interproximal spaces are visualized in the mouth. The gingival epithelial sulcus depth along the inner surface of the gingival margin is nor- mally measured about 3 mm in depth for incisor teeth and 5 mm for cheek teeth. The inner aspect of theattached gingiva is tightly adhered to the clinical crown and underlying bone, effectively blocking entry of oral contents from the gingival sulcus into the alveo- lus and periodontal ligament space. Continual erup- tion of hypsodont teeth is inevitably associated with constant remodeling of the periodontal ligament. 23 2.

For complete evaluation, the veterinar- ian will need to visualize all gingival tissues associ-ated with the lingual and labial aspects of the clinical crowns of the incisors, canine teeth, and cheek teeth. During this process gentle retraction of the lips, cheeks, or tongue is very helpful for visualization. Minimal instrumentation is required Fig. 1. PD associated with valve diastema.

Tooth mobility is assessed by attempting to wiggle the affected tooth with nger pressure or with the aid of a rigid dental scaler, andthe movement can be estimated in millimeters to assign a Mobility Index13(Table 1). Advanced PD is present in any tooth that is mobile > 3 mm and/or isd e p r e s s i b l ei n t ot h ea l v e o l u s .

Removal of roughage allows visual assess- ment of the degree of gingivitis/gingival recession and allows probing. The periodontal probe is used to measure depth by sliding the tip alongside the tooth within the gingival sulcus. If a periodontal pocket is present, the probe will slide deeper within the sulcus in an apical direction alongside the tooth. 16Stagingof PD helps de ne the extent of pathological change that is present.24PD is progressive, meaning that gingivitis, gingival recession, probing depth, and tooth mobility will worsen without treatment. In general terms, PD Stage 1 (PD1) is comprised of gingivitis/ bleeding without attachment loss, while cases withPD2, PD3, or PD4 are characterized by progressive worsening of gingivitis and gingival recession, increased sulcular probing depth, tooth mobility, andalveolar bone loss (attachment loss). The stage of PD present is ascertained via clinical examination and radiography. Dental radiographic techniques arecovered by a different manuscript in this session and have been described extensively. 25-27In cases of PD, radiographs allow the veterinarian to observe the degree of bone loss involving the interproximal alveo-lar crest and alveolar margin in addition to other changes that may be present including sclerosis, wid- ening of the periodontal ligament space, blunting ofthe tooth apices, and lytic changes of subgingival crown and roots. 13Radiographic ndings are then cor- related with clinical ndings to determine the overall severity of attachment loss and stage of PD (Table2). Intraoral images provide excellent detail of al- veolar bone of the incisor teeth and mandibular ca-nine teeth. Due to inherent superimposition of skull structures that occurs with extraoral radiogra- phy of cheek teeth, the author typically acquires anocclusal oblique with the mouth held open by a spec- ulum to evaluate the crestal bone and clinical crowns and an apical oblique view to evaluate thealveolar bone margin, PDL space, and apices (Figs. 2 and 3). Computed tomography eliminates superimposition and provides exquisite detail ofteeth and alveolar bone (Fig. 4). 3. Results and Discussion Periodontal disease is a common af fliction of equids.

For PD affecting the cheek teeth, a dental mirror or endoscope is requisite for recognition. The use of high-pressureirrigation and periodontal instruments to removeentrapped roughage improves visualization of affectedareas and allows detailed inspection of the gingiva forprobing. In addition to clinical examination, radiog-raphy helps detect the degree of bone loss and otherchanges that help determine severity of PD andappropriate treatment planning.

Introduction Periodontal disease is a painful condition affecting young, middle aged, and old horses.1-3Horses are stoic and oftentimes may not show outward signs ofdisease. This makes the oral examination critical inidentifying this painful condition. Horses that doshow outward signs may have a history of quidding,eating slowly, holding their heads sideways whilechewing, or having a thin body condition. 4 Periodontal disease begins as \"food stasis \". Food sta- sis is the accumulation of feed material in the oralcavity adjacent to teeth, most often in the form of a diastema. This decaying feed provides an acidic environment for plaque forming bacteria, leading togingival recession, periodontal attachment loss, and,in severe cases, periodontitis. 2,3Left untreated, peri- odontal disease tooth loss and systemicdisease. These diastema, pleural diastemata, maybe present in horses of any age, may affect incisors orcheek teeth, and may be congenital or ac-quired. They are often associated with a decreasedangulation of the cheek teeth, missing teeth, frac-tured teeth, aging horses, and erupting cheekteeth. Prevention of disease is the gold standardof veterinary medicine. Routine oral exams andeffective odontoplasty (teeth floating) are paramount in preventing abnormal food accumulation. The pre-vention of overlong teeth, excessive wear of teeth inopposing quadrants, steps, hooks, and other areas ofinefcient mastication all play a role in avoiding peri- odontal disease. 4Reduction of these orthodontic abnormalities must be considered when forming atreatment plan. 2. Treatment Planning Any treatment plan for periodontal disease mustbegin with proper staging/grading. Advanced caseswith signi cant attachment loss and loose teeth require extraction. Another manuscript of this ses-sion 5discusses the stages of periodontal disease (Table 1) as well as a tooth mobility index (Table 2). A thorough oral exam coupled with diagnostic quality dental radiographs provide the informationneeded to stage the periodontal disease. Speci cally, the evaluation of bone loss and widened periodontalligament spaces are best visualized on open mouthoblique views. These radiographic projections andhow to obtain them are the topic of another manu-script in this session. 6The focus of this paper will be those cases that have not advanced to the pointof extraction and the efforts that may be made toprevent tooth loss through the treatment ofdiastemata. Diastemata are common in both theincisors and cheek teeth of horses. Treatment ofperiodontal disease associated with diastemata mustinclude the following: 1. Reduction of any abnormalclinical crown overgrowths (steps, ramps, protuberanttransverse ridges); 2. Complete cleaning of the NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 401HOW-TO SESSION: ADVANCING DENTISTRY FOR FIELD USESperiodontal pocket, which in some cases may not be achieved without a diastema widening; 3. Possibly the placement of a perioceutic; and, 4. Possibly seal-ing with a dental packing material. Not all diaste-mata are the same. Treatments will vary based onthe presentation of an open, valvular, or senile dia-stema, orthodontic imbalances, missing teeth, and inci- sors vs. cheek teeth. The primary goal is that during mastication, the horse is able to cycle food betweent e e t hu s i n gt h et o n g u ea n dw a t e rt op r e v e n tq u i d d i n gand food stasis. 3. Materials and Methods Many of the above treatment goals may be achieved by the attending veterinarian with access to appropri- ate equipment and treatment planning. Restraint Periodontal disease is very painful, and additional an- algesic may be necessary to perform treatments of inflamed/infected gingival tissues. The author com- monly uses a combination of detomidine hydrochlor-ide and anti-in flammatory such asflunixin meglumine or phenylbutazone given prior to treatment. In many cases with severe pain, thepatients tongue movement and head tossing becomestoo severe and prevents placement of probes, picks,and curettes. Rotary burs are used for diastema wid-ening and should not be used in a patient that isawake, moving, or reactive. To fully examine and treat these tissues in those most painful cases, it may be necessary to provide local and regional analgesiawith injectable anesthetics. Topical gels and solu-tions may be used with success in milder cases. Themore severe cases most often require a deeper level ofsedation as well as a regional nerve block. A mouth speculum is placed, and with a bright headlamp and mirror or oral endoscope, the examination isperformed. This may be done in a stall, wash rack,or preferably a set of stocks when available. Thoughstocks are not a necessity, they do provide additional support for the more heavily sedated patients. Incisors Treatment of incisors may be achieved with hand scalers, dental curettes, and a toothbrush. These instruments are used to remove feed material and calculus from the interdental space, surface of thetooth, and subgingival tissues. Water picks are also useful in flushing feed between the interden- tal spaces. With a compliant patient, home careby the owner with twice weekly brushing may pre- vent additional gingival recession. 3If the diaste- mata are valvular, then widening of the in-terdental space will be necessary. Cheek Teeth First is removal of feed material and complete cleaningof the periodontal pocket. This may be achieved with dental picks, probes, periodontal grasping forceps, water picks, air abrasion units, and gingival curettes.7,8 These work well in open diastemata. Valvular diaste-mata require widening before they can be fully cleared of feed material (Figs. 1 and 2). Diastema Widening/Burring With the valvular diastema, a diastema widening is often needed to completely remove the feed mate-rial.1,7,8The diastema widening is performed using a rotary bur on a right-angled hand piece, followed bycleaning and disinfecting the pocket. Water cooling is available on some dental units and is needed to pro- tect against thermal pulpal damage to the teeth dur- ing burring.9The rotary bur should be placed parallel with the interdental space such that the bur is extending towards the cheek with the shaft of the dental unit lingual/palatal.7The use of a cheek re- tractor is helpful to prevent iatrogenic damage to thebuccal mucosa. Endoscopic guidance allows for proper positioning of the bur within the interdental space (Fig. 3). There are a variety of carbide and dia- mond coated burs available for diastema widening with both conical and cylindrical shapes commonly used. The carbide burs, while effective at removingdental materials, generate more heat than the dia- mond coated burs. Frequent water cooling is advised. The widening of these valvular defects must extend from the occlusal surface of the crown apically to the gum line (which often has gingival recession). Using a mirror or oral endoscope to moni- tor the bur placement and progress during burring iscrucial. Great caution must be taken to avoid iatro- g e n i cd a m a g et ot h ep u l ph o r n so ft h et w ot e e t h . T h eTable 1.

After widening, the entrapped feed ma- terial can be removed with the aid of instruments,water picks, or air abrasion (Fig. 4). Then the cleaned pocket may be treated. Treatment A variety of materials have been placed in cleaned periodontal pockets to treat the underlying infectionand in flammation. Treatment of these pockets has been the source of much discussion within the veteri- nary dental community. At this time, it is unclear if the use of antibiotics or other perioceutics in thesepockets is absolutely necessary and if so, which is best used in equids or humans. 10Additional long-term studies are needed to evaluate ef cacy. Some of the materials that have commonly been used in the peri- odontal pockets include doxirobe,ametronidazole, Fig. 1. Periodontal instruments: picks, probes, forceps, mirror. Fig. 2.

The interdental space above thesedeep periodontal pockets is often covered with a vinylpolysiloxane (VPS) impression material (Fig. 5). This is placed to prevent additional feed packing and a l l o wt i m ef o rt h ep o c k e tt ob ec o m p l e t e l y lled by this regenerative gingival tissue. 8VPS is available as both a flowable and putty material. The two-part putty materials are typically easier to handle andplace into the more caudal aspects of themouth. This is because the flowable VPS requires an application garant and mixing tip that are dif cult to place into the caudal mouth. Follow Up Recheck exams are performed in three months tomonitor tissue healing. It is not uncommon for theV P St ob ep r e s e n ta tt h et i m eo ft h er e c h e c ke x a m ,and it can be removed at this time. The previousdental pocket should be resolved. This means thereshould be no decaying feed present in the diastema,no probing depth, no gingival recession, and noinflammation/bleeding of the gingival tissues. Some cases are refractory, and repeated treatment may benecessary in a year or more if the periodontal pocketreturns. 7,8Therefore, continued monitoring of these cases long term with accurate oral exam charting iskey to a successful outcome.4. Conclusion Periodontal disease can be a reversible and treatablecondition if caught early. With proper restraint,equipment and training, practitioners can effectivelytreat periodontal disease in a eld setting. Dental ra- d i o g r a p h sm u s tb eu s e dt od e t e r m i n et h es t a g eo fp e r i -odontal disease and underlying tooth viability prior tochoosing a therapy. Adding diastema widening as askill will allow practitioners to offer treatment for apainful condition, stop the progression of disease, andprevent tooth loss in many patients. This treatmentis not innocuous. There is potential for harm includ-ing but not limited to iatrogenic soft tissue trauma,pulp exposure, and pulpal thermal necrosis. Trainingon cadaver specimens with veterinary dental special-ists and attendance at dental speci c continuing edu- cation wet labs are strongly recommended prior toperforming diastema widening in a live patient.

In addition to severe dental attrition and malocclusion, it is the author 'sc l i n i c a le x - perience that affected patients also have signi cant se- nile atrophy of the muscles of mastication. Alongwith the negative effects of aging and dental attrition, as i g n i cant percentage of the geriatric population has coexisting dental problems that include missing teeth, displaced teeth, diastemata, and periodontal disease.2,3 From a dental perspective it is important to rememberthat stress associated with constant oral discomfort and inadequate digestion of nutrients may predispose to a variety of other problems.4As a result, every geri- atric horse should undergo thorough oral examination with regularity in order to address a variety of age- related concerns.4In addition to an oral examination, it is important for the veterinarian to assess for the pres- ence of coexisting contributors to poor health that are prevalent in older patients such as pituitary dysfunc- tion, chronic lameness, hoof abnormalities, or ocular disturbances.2,5With good husbandry, correct feeding of dietary components formulated for senior horses, proper dental care, and appropriate veterinary mainte- nance of various ailments, it is the author 'se x p e r i e n c ethat unreasonable debilitation and excessively thin body condition can often be avoided or improved signi - cantly in older horses. 2.

The author typically obtains photographs to use for comparison of body condition score during subsequent visits. Certain details about an older patient 's husbandry routine are particularly important including deworming history,housing management (stall/dry lot/pasture), level of exercise, individual vs group feeding, quality of water source, and types/amount/quality of ration and rough- age fed. If the patient is presented for evaluation of thin body condition and/or other history or symptoms of illness are detected then the author obtains samples for minimum database laboratory testing (i.e., CBC, serum chemistry panel, serum electro- lytes, baseline adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), fecal egg/gram count) and is routinely offered grazing and pellets to observe the horse 's appetite and chew- ing ability. Oral examination and sedation proce- dures are detailed in a different manuscript of this session, and all abnormalities should be recorded in the dental chart. As with any equid, the front of the mouth (incisive region, lips, and bars) can be examined in senior horses without sophisticated instrumentation. With older equids, the incisor teeth may be severely worn or partially/entirely missing (Fig. 1). If this occurs, the author typi- cally pads the bite plate of the speculum with a small folded towel to protect the gingiva when the mouth is open. The mouth should be thoroughly rinsed and the cheek teeth arcades inspected vis- ually with a mirror to de-tect absence of teeth, smooth teeth, abnormally positioned teeth, over-long teeth, or other malocclusions. Fractured teeth and diastemata can easily be overlooked,especially toward the back of the mouth withoutthe use of a mirror or dental scope. Each row of t e e t hs h o u l da l s ob ee x a m i n e dw i t h ngers to check for sharp areas and loose teeth. Roughage entrapped by diastemata must be removed with irriga- tion and periodontal forceps to allow adequate visualassessment and probing. Radiographic examination is typically performed in cases with suspected apical ab- scess or other apical disease such as equine odontoclas-tic tooth resorption and hypercementosis (EOTRH) and in cases with moderate to severe periodontal disease. Some older patients are presented with foulsmelling unilateral nasal discharge: in these cases,detailed oral examination, upper airway endoscopy, and radiographic examination are important proce- dures to rule out secondary sinus involvement or thepresence of an oroantral or oronasal stula. After opening the dental speculum, it is typical for sedatedolder patients to be resentful and reactive toward in-traoral placement of hands and instruments; as such additional dose(s) of IV sedatives often become neces- sary to safely continue the exam and treatments.Without the stimulatory effects of the dental proce- dures, the senior patient often appears to become much more sedate and ataxic during the recovery pe-riod after the procedures are completed. When thisoccurs, it is important to support the patient 'sh e a dt o prevent severe dependent nasal edema and dyspnea,to monitor the patient closely for safe recovery andwithhold feeding until sedative effects have worn off, and to make sure the patient is on soft/padded footing in case of a fall. In very rare instances, the authorhas found it necessary to mitigate the effects of seda- tion by administration of an alpha-2-agonist reversal agent in these patients. Management of several con-ditions of interest are discussed in the following sections. Malocclusion and Age-Related Dental Attrition Cupping of the maxillary cheek teeth occurs as crown attrition progresses beyond the apical extent of theinfundibula into the apical region of the reserve crownand roots. Clinically this change is rst noticed as a concave appearance to the occlusal surface of teeth109/209, along with the development of a very sharpenamel edge that causes abrasions to the adjacent cheek. In addition, an undulating wave malocclusion comprised of worn and overlong teeth is a commonnding (Fig. 2). With continued attrition, the man- dibular premolar teeth and remaining maxillarymolars sequentially may become very smoothwith the gingival margin. This pattern of age- related dental attrition results in diminished masticatory ability especially in regard to coarseroughage. 6 The goal of treatment in senior horses is to perform odontoplasty of sharp enamel edges and overlongteeth in order to improve comfort during masticationand performance. It is not appropriate to attempt torestore normal occlusion of the cheek teeth in an old horse with severe wave malocclusion \u2014to do this may Fig. 1. Severe incisor attrition.HOW-TO SESSION: ADVANCING DENTISTRY FOR FIELD USES 406 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSworsen masticatory ability by elimination of existing areas of occlusion.4As such the author is typically very conservative with odontoplasty of wave malocclu-sion in senior patients. Equine Odontoclastic Tooth Resorption and Hypercementosis Most commonly EOTRH is a condition of older horses involving resorptive lesions and hypercementosis ofthe incisor teeth and canine teeth, and less commonly the cheek teeth.7,8The syndrome is gradual in onset and often undiagnosed until extensive lesions are present. EOTRH is diagnosed radiographically andtypical ndings include irregular areas of tooth lysis affecting one or more teeth, fracture of the reservecrown, production of excessive cementum, widening ofthe periodontal ligament space, and alveolar boneloss. Pathological changes of the teeth and sur-rounding structures may result clinically in gingivitis/bleeding, gingival recession, distortion of alveolarbone, parulis lesions (gum boils), pathologic tooth frac-ture, and discomfort (Fig. 3). Extraction of affectedteeth generally results in resolution of clinical signs. Although general anesthesia is occasionally required due to fractious behavior or inability toachieve suf cient standing analgesia, extraction of affected incisor teeth using a simple approach can typ-ically be carried out in the standing patient withadequate IV sedation/analgesia, regional nerve block,or local gingival anesthetic injections. Radiographsshould con rm complete tooth removal, and suturing of the gingiva will help decrease contamination ofhealing alveoli in the days following surgery. Periodontal Disease Diastemata of the premolar/molar teeth are very com-m o ni na g e dh o r s e si np a r td u et og r a d u a ln a r r o w i n g of tooth circumference as the tooth is worn toward the apical region. Thus, over time a small interproximalgap occurs between neighboring teeth that allowsentrapment of roughage (known as a senilediastema). Less severe cases exhibit gingivitis andhalitosis. These bene tf r o mo d o n t o p l a s t yo foverlong teeth and tall occlusal transverse ridges, along with daily mouth rinses to help control gingivitis. An effective oral rinse solution can be pre- pared using a solution of dilute chlorhexidine gluco- nate 2.0% solution and water (10 -20 mL of chlorhexidine sol. per gallon of water). Feeding soft diets comprised of ne grass hay, lush pasture, and/or complete feed pellets help reduce entrapment ofcoarse roughage within affected interproximal spaces. The author will commonly perform intraoral extrac-tion of mobile cheek teeth in senior equids affected with advanced periodontal disease. These include teeth that are depressible within the alveolus, teeth that have mobility greater than 3 mm, and teeth that are abnormally positioned in association with severevalve diastemata. Adequate IV sedation/analgesia, local gingival anesthetic, and regional nerve block allow the extraction to proceed with maximal patient comfort. In cases of diastemata exhibiting bleeding, odor, gingival recession, and <2-3mm of tooth mobil- ity, the author typically performs radiographs to assess the apical region and ascertain the degree of alveolar bone loss. In the absence of apical abscess or other complicating factors, the severity, bleeding, odor, and discomfort in these cases generally improve substan-tially after odontoplasty and mechanical widening of the affected interproximal space. A small diameter but problematic oroantral stula or oronasal stula may develop in aged horses in association with diaste-mata, fractured teeth, or severely worn teeth in themaxillary arcades. 9Chronic periodontitis in these cases allows progressively deeper involvement anddestruction of alveolar bone resulting in stula formation. Clinically an oroantral or oronasal stula allows oral contents and roughage stems to enter the Fig. 2. Signi cant age-related dental attrition and malocclusion. Fig. 3. Abnormal appearance of the incisive region in a horse affected by severe EOTRH.HOW-TO SESSION: ADVANCING DENTISTRY FOR FIELD USES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 407ipsilateral maxillary sinus or nasal passage (Fig. 4). Either of these situations manifests primarily as uni- lateral nasal discharge with foul odor. For diagnosis,oral examination will identify a deep valve diastemataor deep periodontal tract alongside the offendingtooth. Nasal endoscopy stula is suspected; however, CT imaging is highly rewarding in these cases in terms of identifying apically infected teeth anddening the severity, extent, and location of the stula. Effective treatment of an oroantral or oro- nasal stula in geriatric patients requires patience and owner commitment. In general terms, treatmententails stula debridement, extraction of loose teeth or apically infected teeth, and temporary obturation oft h eo r a ls i d eo ft h e stula until healing. Appropriate treatment of sinusitis is required in the managementof an oroantral stula, and for an oronasal stula roughage stems can be removed from the nasal pas- sage with long forceps under endoscopic guidance. A very important management principle is elimination ofcoarse-stem roughage from the diet until healing of thestula occurs. In the absence of apical infection or loose teeth on either side of a diastema, it may be possi-ble to obtain closure of the stula in aged horses by treating concurrent sinusitis and sealing the oral as-pect of the interproximal space with dental acrylic. 9There are a few clinical reports detailing suc- cessful surgical treatment of oronasal or oroantral s- tulae in horses.10-13 Oral Masses An oral neoplasm originating from bone, soft tissue, or dental tissue should be included as a consideration if an oral mass is encountered upon examination14,15 (Fig. 5). In some cases the presence of a non-neo- plastic mass such as granulation tissue or gingivalhyperplasia may mimic the appearance of an oralneoplasm. 15If an oral neoplasm is suspected then referral to a specialty center for advanced imaging and potential treatment is suggested by theauthor. Appropriate initial workup of an oral massincludes biopsy of the lesion and histopathology, CBC- Chemistry panel, and radiography or CT study to evaluate underlying structures.Feeding an Older \"Thin Horse \" Nutritional counseling is an important aspect of vet- erinary dental care in senior patients. The author isnot a nutritional expert but does attempt to keep afew simple rules-of-thumb in mind when makingnutritional recommendations for otherwise healthybut thin senior patients: \u0081A thorough dental exam and appropriate labora- tory workup should precede ration modi cation. 16 \u0081Thin geriatric patients should be fed a commer- cial senior feed formulation. The author typi- cally recommends to gradually build up to at least 1%-1.5% body weight per day divided intothree to four feedings. \u0081If thin patients are unable to masticate highquality long-stem hay, then an alternate rough-age source such as soaked alfalfa cubes or pel- lets should be fed in addition to the commercial senior ration. Fat supplementation can behelpful in these patients to increase caloric intake for improvement in body condition. Fig. 4.

Results and Discussion The challenges associated with dental care in senior age equids can be somewhat unique from other agegroups. Despite decreased chewing ability, olderhorses, ponies, and donkeys can have a good qualityexistence with proper intervention. 17Oral examina- tion presents an opportunity for the veterinarian tocreate client awareness of the effects of age-relateddental attrition and to discuss important dietary mod-ications that may be required. 6Along with identi - cation and treatment of various age-related dentaland non-dental abnormalities, the attentive veterinar-ian can capably assess the older patient' s nutritional status. Veterinarians should continually strive toequip themselves with proper dental knowledge andinstrumentation in order to successfully manage prob-lems in the particular age group under examination.

Introduction The past two decades in veterinary medicine have seen an increase in the number of specialtycolleges. This has led to an array of board-certi ed specialists in many different disciplines. BoardCertied Veterinary Dentist TM(BCVD) in equine is now a specialty that is recognized af liated with the American Veterinary Dental College.1The European Veterinary Dental College2also has an equine dental specialty. With this progress, veteri-narians now have the opportunity to refer and consultwith a colleague with advanced equine dentaltraining. The transfer of information is often a frus- tration for the practitioner trying to get help with the cases and the referral center. This presentation willdiscuss how to make this a smoother process for bothparties to reduce frustration and increase the client 's satisfaction from both parties. 3Many examples will be given of the information that should be providedbetween the referring doctor (RDVM) and the BCVD. 2. Materials and Methods The practitioner is often presented with a case that ischallenging and wishes to seek advice on how toproceed. This is often done by contacting someone with an interest or specialty title in the discipline of the particular case. Dentistry is no different. Given the vast number of dental diagnoses and different eti-ologies that are seen related to the age of the horse, arriving at a treatment plan can be a complex process. The practitioner should always provide asmuch information as possible. This would include thefollowing: 1. Signalment of the horse 2. Duration of the signs3. Pictures of the clinical ndings and, wherever possible, intraoral pictures 4. Examination ndings 5. Diagnostic images correctly labeled of the affected and nonaffected side 6. Appropriate client information and horse 'sn a m e The client' s expectations are to nd out what treat- ment is necessary and then get an estimate of the cost for the procedures. The client generally has many factors to consider when making decisions. These include the cost, the amount of time the horse is notin performance, the competence of how the NOTES 410 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: ADVANCING DENTISTRY FOR FIELD USESinformation was portrayed, the geographical consider- ation of hauling the horse, and their time investment. Often, clients will have considerations that can seem remedial to the practitioner but can bea large factor in their decision. This could include the clients paying for training and board while the horse is recovering at a hospital. One must listen toall of the owners' concerns and help them navigate an appropriate solution. 4The RDVM that is sending the information for consultation or referral must often ask these questions of the specialist for the owner ei- ther in an email or via phone call. One good solutionis to have a form letter that the RDVM can ll out and send to the referral center. This makes a check-list of the information so that nothing is lefto u t . P i c t u r e sc a nt h e nb ep l a c e di nt h ed o c u m e n t and emailed directly to the specialist. The RDVM can then easily le this information for the future if the client chooses to use them for a procedure. It 's important to remember that many things can still beconveyed with a simple phone call between the twoparties. This can include information about the per- sonality of both the client and the animal. This helps prepare the referral center for the case and dealing with the expectations of the client. The referral center/specialist needs to act in a reasonable andexpedient manner when they receive request for consults. This not only bene ts the practitioner in their ability to help the patient but also builds loyalty between the RDVM and specialist. The specialist should not hesitate to call the referring doctor to speak to them personally if further information is neededabout the case. The BCVD should also consider hav- ing an online portal or form letter for the RDVM to ll o u ta n da d dp i c t u r e s( F i g .1 ) . I ti sa l s oag o o di d e at ohave some sort of storage modality that the specialist can organize and store the referral information. Thisway, if it is a signi cant amount of time from initial discussion to when the client schedules the procedure, they will still have the information in an organizedmanner (Fig. 2). If the BCVD is not receiving the information in a manner that is conducive to providing an accurate di-agnosis, then they should provide images or communi-cate their expectations to the RDVM so that they canlearn from the interaction for future instances. Oneof the most important points in the relationship for any specialist is to never give the impression that the referring doctor has done or provided sublevel care orinformation. This is also never to be spoken of or con-veyed to the specialist 'ss t a f f . T h i si n f o r m a t i o nc a n get back to either the client or the referring doctorwhich can often lead to much frustration and the needto apologize or potentially ruin the relationshipaltogether. There are times, however, when the spe-cialist may need to convey information to the RDVM onhow the case was not handled appropriately. Thismust be done in a professional manner and in a waythat is constructive. Veterinarians generally have agreat deal of pride in their work and are only trying todo their best. The specialist can use this situation toeducate the RDVM on different approaches, whichwill enhance the relationship rather than createtension. The nal important point is that the special- ist should not attempt to get the client to switch to using their services exclusively. This is accomplished by providing the client with the feeling that the refer-ring doctor is part of the decision-making process andhas an important role in the aftercare of the patient. 3. Discussion The process of referring a case to a specialist should be smooth and painless. Both parties must place Fig. 1. Online portal of a veterinary referral form utilized by the author' s practice.HOW-TO SESSION: ADVANCING DENTISTRY FOR FIELD USES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 411effort in the information exchange so that the patient and client can have a successful outcome. This canbe a mutual relationship that will reap considerablebenets for the client and patient. The close relation- ship between referring veterinarian and specialist mustalways be protected and honored. Clients can at timesmay promote dissension by miscommunicating what was said by one or the other veterinarian. This mustbe quelled immediately and may require a phone callbetween the veterinarians. If all goes well, the refer-ring veterinarian can get their client help that they can-not easily provide and also retain them as aclient. The specialist should see the referring veteri- narian as an extension and a part of their p r a c t i c e . T h i sw a y ,t h eR D V Mf e e l sa st h o u g ht h e yare part of the care and will be supported by thespecialist. 4. Conclusion The referral process can be a tenuous one if all of the necessary information is not conveyed by the referring doctor. Sending radiographs with no history or clini- calndings is not appropriate. This leads to special- ist support staff spending countless time trying toemail and call the referring doctors for furtherinformation. This causes loss of valuable time to theclient and patient. The specialist needs to also pro-vide timely information back to the referring doctor so that the client can make appropriate decisions.

The main objective of the study was todevelop and describe a minimally invasive sinoscopictechnique (MIST) that simpli es the surgical approach/invasiveness of the traditional technique toperform sinoscopy while allowing a thorough sinusevaluation. 4In addition, a secondary objective was that MIST should be relatively simple to perform andlearn and that it can be performed either in a hospitalor ambulatory setting for practitioners with a goodknowledge of sinus anatomy. Last, three differentsinoscopic approaches were evaluated and comparedto determine what approaches would be recom-mended to perform. The author 's institutionh y p o t h e s i z e dt h a tM I S Tw o u l db es i m p l et op e r f o r mand that at least 2 approaches would be required toobtain a thorough evaluation of the sinuses. 2. Materials and Methods To perform the MIST, a flexible and disposable 2-mm- diameter and 18-cm-long endoscopeawas designed in collaboration with a veterinary endoscopy company(Fig. 1). This endoscope is longer and flexible when compared to the traditional needle endoscopeacom- monly used to perform standing arthroscopy in horsesbut is compatible with the same arthroscopicconsole. The endoscope lacks a control knob, a flush system, or an instrument channel; however, its priceis signi cantly lower than a specialized 2-mm endo- scope with the aforementioned features. In order toidentify the ideal landmarks to perform MIST and todetermine the thoroughness of sinus evaluation,cadaveric heads from horses older than 5 years oldand of various common breeds were used. Then, thetechnique was carried out in healthy horses to deter-mine the suitability of the technique in live horsesand validate it. Last, MIST was performed inselected clinical patients either after primary recom-mendation by the attending clinician or when CT ex-amination was not a diagnostic option for the owner. Sinoscopic Landmarks The traditional landmarks to perform sinoscopy/trephination were slightly modi ed (Fig. 2) to be able NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 413HOW-TO SESSION: ADVANCING DENTISTRY FOR FIELD USESto obtain a thorough sinus evaluation with the 2-mm endoscope:4-6 1. To access the frontal sinus, the mini-sinusot- omy was performed at 40% of the distancefrom the medial canthus of the eye to midline and 2 cm caudal to the rostral aspect of the rostral lacrimal tubercle, lacrimal tubercle a bony and slightly dorsomedialto the medial canthus and serves as the inser- tion point for the orbicular muscle. 2. To access the caudal maxillary sinus, the mini-sinusotomy was performed 1 cm rostral and 3 cm ventral to the rostral aspect of the rostral lacrimal tubercle, with the needle inserted perpendicular to the bone. 3. To access the rostral max illary sinus, the mini- sinusotomy should be performed 40% of thedistance from the rostral end of the facial crest to the level of the medial canthus and 1 cm ven-tral to a line joining the infraorbital foramenand the medial canthus, with the needle directed slightly upwards (approximately 30\u00b0). This needle orientation facilitates advancement of thescope over the infraorbital canal.

Only during this cadaveric phase, and after enlarging the frontal mini-sinusotomy with a 5- mm Steinmann pin, the MSB was fenestrated under endoscopic guidance with a 14-G catheter trocar. Thefenestration was made at the level of the infraorbital canal (medial to lateral direction) and as dorsal and ros- tral as possible in the segment of the MSB protruding through the fronto-maxillary opening. The flexible endoscope was then inserted through the newly createdopening, and the RMS and VCS were evaluated. MIST in Healthy Horses 1. Horses were premedicated with procaine peni- cillin (22 000 with detomidine (0.01mg/kg IV) and butorphanol (0.01 mg/kg IV), and restrained in standing stocks. 2. The region overlying the paranasal sinuses was clipped and aseptically prepared. Skinand subcutis were anesthetized with 1 mL of lidocaine hydrochloride 2% at the selected landmarks (Fig. 1). 3. A 3-mm stab incision was performed with a number-11 scalpel blade through the skin and soft tissues until contacting bone. Next, a mini- sinusotomy/trephination was created by advanc- ing a 3.8-cm-long, 14-G needle (2.1-mm diameter) through the frontal (FS approach), zygomatic, or lacrimal (CMS approach) and maxillary bones ( R M Sa p p r o a c h )w i t ht h ea i do fam a l l e t . 4. The needle was then removed with circular movements to allow enlargement of the mini- sinusotomy and thereby facilitate entry of the 2-mm flexible endoscope. 5. Sinoscopic evaluation through the FS, CMS, and RMS approaches was then carried out ineach horse (Fig. 4). 6. After sinoscopy, the sinuses were flushed with approximately 500 mL of isotonic solution to prevent secondary infection, and an adhesive bandage was placed around the head for 2 days. The skin incisions were not closed. 7. The endoscope was only wiped with alcohol before each procedure. Procedural time started at the time of the rst inci- sion and ended after sinuses were lavaged. Anyintraoperative or complications were recorded. A Wilcoxon-signed rank test (Prism, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) was performedto determine the best approach to examine the CMS(FS versus CMS). A pvalue of less than 0.05 was considered statistically signi cant. For clinical patients, the procedure was carried out as aforemen-tioned, although preprocedural antimicrobials and postprocedural sinus lavage were not used. In addi- tion, the endoscope was cleaned and sterilized withcold sterilization bbefore each procedure due to the higher risk of bacterial contamination during the pro-cedure in clinical cases with sinusitis. 3. Results Cadaveric Specimens Breeds included during the cadaveric phase (10 horses) were 4 Standardbreds, 3 Quarter Horses, 1 Percheron, 1 Hanoverian, and 1 Welsh pony. A vari-ety of breeds were included to be able to validate thetechnique in horses of most sizes. In cadaveric speci-mens (mean age of 12 years old and range of 6- 20 years old), most evaluated structures (9/11 for FS and 8/8 CMS) received a median score of 3 (range 2-3)through the FS and CMS, which indicated a thoroughsinus evaluation during these approaches. A medianscore of 2 (range 0-3 for both) was obtained for the cra-niomedial aspect of the dorsal conchal sinus and the caudal cul-de-sac of the frontal sinus. As it occurs with traditional sinoscopy, manipulation of the endo-scope within the RMS was limited, and scores obtainedwere lower (median and range of 3 and 0-3, respec-tively). 5,6Five out of the six structures evaluated had a median score of at least 2.5 (range 2.5-3); however, themedian score for the visualization of the caudal tooth roots of 08s was 0 (range 0-3). Fenestration of the MSB to improve visualization of the VCS and RMS wasattempted during the cadaveric phase. Unfortunately,the RMS and/or VCS was completely visible in only 3 Fig. 4.

Additionally, both study phases revealed that there was no difference for thevisualization of the structures within the CMS when t h eF Sa n dC M Sa p p r o a c h e sw e r ec o m p a r e d( p= 0.32). Thus, the CMS approach was considered asoptional for clinical cases. With regard to the RMS approach, a score of 3/3 was obtained for all struc-tures, which signi cantly improved the results obtained in the cadaveric phase for the tooth roots of08s. Thus, the technique was considered to be vali- dated for its use on live horses. The procedure took 34.265.8 minutes (all 3 approaches) to be performed, and all horses tolerated the procedure well. Two to three gentle taps of the mallet were generally enough to go through the bone with the 14-G needle to perform the 2.1-mm mini-sinusotomy. Fogging or darkening of theeld of view was frequently encountered upon endo- scope introduction on live horses. Nonetheless, this quickly resolved by either contacting an adjacent muco- sal surface or by cleaning the endoscope tip with a wet gauze before reintroducing the endoscope within the sinuses. No personnel or equipment damageoccurred. No intraoperative complications were noted during the procedures other than mild petechiation in the RMS mucosa in 3/6 horses. This was associated to contact of the endoscope with the sinus mucosa while cleaning the endoscopic lens. All horses developedmild (2-cm diameter or less) subcutaneous emphysema at the level of the mini-sinusotomies within a few hours of the procedure that lasted between 12 and 24 hours. In one horse, moderate emphysema (4-cm diameter around the RMS mini-sinusotomy) extendedrostrally and ventrally after MIST and persisted for 72 hours. All incisions were macroscopically healed upon bandage removal 48 hours after the procedure, and the cosmetic appearance was considered excellent for all horses but one. This horse developed local thickening(1.5 cm /C21.5 cm) at the FS mini-sinusotomy, which resolved after 2 weeks. No signs of sinus or incisionalinfection were noted postoperatively. Clinical Cases To date, the MIST has been used in 8 clinical cases since its introduction to the clinic (Fig. 5 and Table 1). The technique has been considered useful for case management (con rmed lack of sinus involve- ment [2/8], obtained a de nitive diagnosis [2/8], or guided surgical approach [3/8]) in 7/8 cases. In one case, severe and diffuse pus presence in all sinuscompartments prevented appropriate sinus visualiza- tion with the MIST despite sinus lavage was attempted. However, the technique partially helped to decide the surgical approach (maxillary sinus flap) in this case. Regarding the MIST approachesperformed in clinical cases, 5 horses received the FS and RMS approaches, while 3 horses received the FS approach only. No intra- or post-MIST complica-tions were encountered other than mild self-limit- ing subcutaneous emphysema in at least 2 cases. Unfortunately, the self-limiting nature of t h ee m p h y s e m aa n dt h er e t r o s p e c t i v en a t u r eo f the study prevented obtaining more informationin this regard. In one horse presenting fluid accumulation in the rostral sinuses based on radi-ography, the FS mini-sinusotomy was enlargedwith a 7-mm Steinman pin to allow guided perfo- ration of the MSB while visualizing the area with the 2-mm endoscope. This approach allowedinspissated pus removal and lavage of the rostral sinus compartments with a sinusotomy half the size of a traditional trephination. Telephone fol-low-up information revealed neither recurrence from the original sinusal problem nor presence of complications associated to MIST or treatment in 7/8 cases (5/8 horses are alive and 2/8 were eutha- nized due to a severe colic episode months afterMIST). Euthanasia during hospitalization due to poor progression was carried out in the case with the comminuted mandibular fracture. 4. Discussion The MIST allowed thorough paranasal sinus evalua- tion in horses thanks to a novel 2-mm flexible endo- scope introduced through a mini-sinusotomy performed with a 14-G needle (2.1 mm) in standing sedated horses. The mini-sinusotomy itself is easy to perform and does not require special expertise orinstrumentation. In fact, this technique is routinely used in the author 's institution for sinus sampling or lavages. In contrast, appropriate knowledge of sinus anatomy is necessary to perform and interpret the sinoscopic images obtained with MIST. Sinus anat- omy is complex, but recent open-access literature(Anatomy and Diagnostic Imaging of the Equine Paranasal Sinuses, Educational Resources,University of Georgia) and performance of anatomicdissections can greatly facilitate practitioners 'self- learning.

However, they a r ec o s t - p r o h i b i t i v ea n dp r o n et od a m a g e .7,8Thus, The author 's institution used a 2-mm endoscope that is affordable (approximately $600) and reusable. To date, the same endoscope has been used for all clinicalcases without being damaged, although it was antici-pated that they have a limited life span, and can bedamaged if used forcefully. With regard to steriliza-tion, sinoscopy is not a clean procedure due to the bac-terial population normally present in the sinuses,and as such, endoscope sterilization may not berequired. However, it is likely recommended tosterilize the endoscope with cold sterilization b between procedures as most clinical cases wherethe endoscope will be used will present activeinfection. The reported landmarks should berespected to allow adequate manipulation ofthe endoscope within the sinuses and thereby ex-haustive sinus evaluation. These modi ed land- marks were the result of information gatheredduring the cadaveric phase of the study and high-light that precision is required when performinga smaller sinusotomy (2.1 vs. 10 mm) forsinoscopy. The flexible endoscope was easy to manipulate and allowed a rapid evaluation(approximately 30 minutes) of the paranasal sinuswithout signi cant complications. To facilitate introduction and manipulation of the endoscopewithin the sinuses, it is crucial to perform circularmovements with the 14-G needle once the mini-sinus-otomy has been performed, with the goal of enlargingit. It is recommended to use two hands to manipulatethe endoscope. A hand close to the mini-sinusotomyportal is used to introduce or withdraw the endoscope,while the other hand is used by the camera piece toallow 360\u00b0 rotation of the endoscope, which is neededto thoroughly explore the sinuses. It is also recom- mended to perform all the mini-sinusotomies rst and then carry out the MIST through each portal. This approach will promote clotting at the sinusotomy sitesand therefore minimize sinus bleeding, which mayobscure the eld of view during sinoscopy. Bleeding was not a problem in healthy horses or clinical patientseven though the latter presented mucosal in flamma- tion secondary to the pre-existing sinus pathology. Aspreviously mentioned, there were no visualization dif-ferences between the CMS and the FS approach toexplore the CMS in healthy horses. Thus, the CMSapproach was not performed in clinical cases andshould be reserved for cases where the FS approachdoes not allow thorough evaluation of the CMS (i.e.,when there is a very prominent bulla of the MSB thatreduces visualization of teeth 10 and 11). In fact, theFS approach allows a look into the CMS with perspec-tive, which is bene cial in horses where the sinus is partly lled with pus. In contrast, the minimal inva- siveness of this technique and the lack of a controlknob in the 2-mm flexible endoscope does not allow routine perforation of the MSB to look with perspectiveinto the RMS and the CVS. This is a limitation of thetechnique that was bypassed in healthy horses withthe RMS ap-proach. It was believed that the bone of live horses was softer than in cadavers and that this allowed further enlargement of the mini-sinusotomyand therefore better visualization of the roots of teeth08. However, the experience with clinical cases hasrevealed that visualization of the small rostral sinuscompartments in cases where there is signi cant pus accumulation could be challenging. In those cases, per-forming a sinus lavage through a 14-G needle to reducethe sinus contents before attempting MIST could be rec-ommended, although it may be unsuccessful in caseswith inspissated pus. Thus, selected cases may bene t from enlarging the FS sinusotomy and perforating thebulla at that stage as it was carried out for horse8. Last, only performing the FS approach may bedeemed required. This was the case in 3 clinical caseswhere the FS approach was enough to obtain a de nitive diagnosis (1), to guide treatment (1), or to rule out cau-dal sinus pathology (1). No major complications were found during MIST, hospitalization, or follow- up. Complications such as wound infection, bonesequestrum, or suture exostosis, which are commonlyassociated with trephination for traditional sinoscopy,were not found and are unlikely to occur consider-ing the reduced invasiveness of this tech-nique. 9Postprocedural emphysema was absent or minimal in clinical cases when compared tohealthy horses. This is thought to be associatedto the mucosal in flammation present in the sinuses of affected cases, which may have sealedthe mini-sinusotomy hole after the procedure andprevented air from leaking into the sub-cutis. Regardless, emphysema is transient andresolves within days if present. Gentle needleinsertion (gentle mallet taps during insertion)while performing the mini-sinusotomy of the RMSis strongly advised. This will prevent iatrogenic damage to the infraorbital canal as it is located close to the maxillary bone at this level. TheMIST was conceived as a diagnostic alternative to CTand traditional sinoscopy that could allow populariza-tion of sinoscopy among practitioners due to its simplic-ity and reduce invasiveness and morbidity. Theauthor believes that with minimal training, practi-tioners may become pro cient in the technique. Nevertheless, CT should still be considered as the goldstandard to diagnose sinus pathology, and traditionalsinoscopy can be used for diagnostic and therapeuticpurposes, while MIST is mainly conceived for diagnos-tic purposes. The reported technique should be espe-cially useful for practitioners without access to CT,those working in an ambulatory setting, and/orthose looking for a simpler sinoscopic technique.Furthermore, the technique has shown value as ascreening technique. It ruled out sinus involvementi nt w oc a s e sw h e r es i n u sa f f e c t i o nb yi n v o l v e m e n tw a s still considered possible after initial work-up and basic imaging (radiography and nasal endoscopy). In theinstitution where the study was performed (secondaryreferral hospital), the number of cases receiving MISTHOW-TO SESSION: ADVANCING DENTISTRY FOR FIELD USES 418 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSis increasing; however, it is worth mentioning that many horses presented for sinus disease still go directly for CT due to its superior diagnostic rate, theavailability at the institution, and the chronicity and complexity of most of the cases admitted. This should not necessarily be the case for most equine practitionersor primary hospitals. The technique presents several limitations. First, the technique requires a practice investment to purchase the endoscopic console,although practices performing standing arthroscopy may already have it. Second, the flexible endoscope lacks a control knob and a flush system, although this can be bypassed by manually guiding the endoscopewithin the sinus and by directly cleaning the lens with a wet gauze or by contacting sinus mucosa when fog-ging is identi ed. Fogging was not a problem in clini- cal cases. Third, it requires some degree of trainingand a good knowledge of sinus anatomy. However,the learning curve is not steep. Last, more clinical cases are needed to determine the diagnostic capabil- ities of the technique for each of the different sinuspathologies. To summarize, MIST is a diagnostic al- ternative to CT and traditional sinoscopy that can be used in addition to traditional imaging. MIST offersthe advantage of being portable, involves a less inva- sive approach, and is performed rapidly and with a lower cost to clients, although specialized equipment isrequired.

While wolf teethare often positioned directly rostral to the secondpremolar (Triadan -06), they can be found any-w h e r ea l o n gt h eb a r( F i g .1 ) . 2Occasionally, a wolf tooth will develop in a more mesially (ros-trally) tipped or horizontal plane, as opposed tothe normal vertical orientation, within the alveo- lus, resulting in a blind or nonerupted wolf tooth. 3These can also be palpated anywhere along the bars; care should be taken in mares notto mistake nonerupted canines for blind wolfteeth. Depending on a horse 's use, blind wolf teeth can be associated with bitting problems andcan lead to head tossing, resistance to pressurewith the bit, and general discomfort when beingridden. 4In these instances, the nonerupted wolf teeth require extraction, which can be dif cult due to lack of visualization, abnormal positioningin the alveolus, and amount of tissue overlayingthe tooth. At Rood and Riddle Equine Hospitalover a 5-year period (2015 -2020), wolf tooth extractions were performed on 1185 horses, andof those, 28 (2.4%) had blind wolf teeth. Thesehorses were identi ed from a complete oral examon a horse with only one visible wolf tooth or ahistory of bitting problems. For those horseswith reported bitting problems who were laterfound to have a blind wolf tooth at the point of bitcontact, extraction of the nonerupted tooth resolved the clinical signs. 2. Materials and Methods It is important to obtain a detailed history from the client. The patient should be well sedated \u2014the author uses detomidine hydrochloride (0.01 -0.02 mg/ kg IV) \u2014and well restrained in stocks or in a stall. Once the patient is sedated, a dental speculumshould be placed to maintain the safety of the practi-tioner and allow for proper visualization of the entireoral cavity. Using an appropriate light source, per-form a complete oral exam including a visual inspec-tion of the oral cavity and also manual palpation ofthe bars. This is especially important in horses witha history of bitting problems to differentiate causes ofbitting pain such as a blind wolf tooth versus osteitisor bruising along the bar. If performing a routinewolf tooth extraction and only visualizing one eruptedwolf tooth, always palpate along the opposing bar todetermine the presence of a blind wolf tooth. Once ablind wolf tooth has been identi ed on palpation, it is important to obtain radiographs to show the position-ing of the tooth within the alveolus. As stated above,these wolf teeth often are nonerupted due to a more NOTES 420 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW-TO SESSION: ADVANCING DENTISTRY FOR FIELD USEShorizontal position within the alveolus. Analyzing the position of the tooth along the bar and within the alveolus via radiographs is important for planning theplacement of the wolf tooth elevators (Fig. 2). Extraction Supplies (Fig. 3) \u00812% lidocaine \u008110cc syringe (regular or luer fly catheter \u0081#10 scalpel blade \u0081Wolf tooth elevators (the author uses long handled half circle offset wolf toothelevators. aThe offset angle of the elevators corresponds to the width of the maxilla,allowing for a more direct approach to thewolf tooth.)Extraction Procedure 1. Palpate the location of the blind wolf tooth. 2. Using a 10cc syringe with 2% lidocaine and an attached 21ga butter fly catheter, perform a local block of the mucosa directly adjacent to the blind wolf tooth, forming a small bleb with2 to 3 mL of 2% lidocaine (Fig. 4). Infuse anadditional 2 to 3 mL local anesthetic along theperiosteum on the buccal aspect (Fig. 5). 3. Holding the scalpel in a bumper press method to control the depth of the incision,make a stab incision through the mucosadirectly over the rostral aspect of the blindwolf tooth, inserting until contacting thetooth (Fig. 6).

Place the wolf tooth elevator at the rostral and dorsal aspect between the tooth and alve- olar bone at the appropriate angle as seen onthe radiographs (Fig. 7). Applying steadygentle pressure distally, move the elevators ina dorsal to buccal arcing motion until thetooth is mobile. Once the tooth is suf ciently mobile, move the elevator in a larger arc fromthe buccal to the mesial aspect of the tooth toluxate the tooth out of the alveolus andthrough the stab incision. If the tooth is toolarge, the incision can be extended slightly toallow the tooth to be removed. 3. Discussion Blind wolf teeth can cause extreme discomfort in the bitted performance horse and frustration for ownersand trainers. Knowledge about the proper approach to identifying and extracting these teeth can give the general equine practitioner the tools necessary toaddress these problem horses. While radiographs are not required to manage these cases, they are highly recommended, especially when performingthese extractions for the rst time. Utilizing dental radiographs for extraction planning can reduce the risk of complications and allow the practitioner to be more ef cient when performing this procedure. The above extraction procedure details the process for extracting blind maxillary wolf teeth as these are more common. The procedure is the same to extracta blind mandibular wolf tooth, manipulating the wolf tooth extractors from the ventral aspect of the tooth in a buccal to lingual motion. As with all extractions,there are risks of complications including fracturedroots, laceration of the greater palatine artery, lacera- tion of the mucosa, and fracture of alveolar bone. 5The lack of visualization and abnormal posi- tion of the tooth inherently make these extractions more complicated. Fracture of the tooth can occur if excessive force is applied to the tooth prior to appro-priate loosening of the periodontal ligament or in mature horses in which ankylosis of the root is more common. If the root fragment is below the gingivalmargin and cannot be palpated, the fragment can of- ten remain without complication. If the fragment extends beyond the alveolar bone, it can irritate softtissues and cause even more discomfort when bitted,so all care should be taken to extract the remaining fragment. Laceration of the greater palatine artery can occur when extracting wolf teeth, especiallywhen displaced palatally. It is important to main- tain control of the tip of the elevator to prevent slippage off the palatal aspect of the bone or inad-vertently if the patient moves during the extraction. This can be avoided by placing the ele- vator along the distal or buccal margins of the toothand only moving the elevator in an arc from the buccal to the mesial aspects of the tooth until the tooth is appropriately loosened. The incisionmade through the mucosa should only be large Fig. 5. Block the periosteum along the buccal aspect of the bone. Fig. 6. Using the bumper press method, make a stab incision at the rostral aspect of the blind wolf tooth, inserting the scalpel until contacting the tooth. Fig. 7. The elevator should be placed at the rostral and dorsalaspect between the tooth and alveolar bone.HOW-TO SESSION: ADVANCING DENTISTRY FOR FIELD USES 422 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSenough to allow the tooth to luxate out of the alveolus. If the incision is larger than desired orthe elevator has slipped during the procedure and lacerated through the mucosa, sutures can be placed across the incision to prevent excessive feedcontamination of the extraction site. Lastly, afterextraction, palpate the margin of the alveolar boneto ensure there are no loose pieces of bone thatcould result in a sequestrum and be sure to smoothany rough bony edges to prevent soft tissue careis minimal; a nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory can be given for 2 to 3 days, and refrain from placing abit in the mouth for 3 to 5 days to allow forhealing. Antibiotics are not warranted unless asecondary complication arises. 4. Summary Extraction of blind wolf teeth can be performedsuccessfully in a farm setting on a standingpatient with proper chemical and physical restraint, local analgesia, and appropriate extrac- tion equipment.Acknowledgments Declaration of Ethics The Author has adhered to the Principle of Veterinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.

Introduction Planning for the animal component of disaster response is federally mandated by the PetsEvacuation and Transportation Standards (PETS)Act passed in 2006. 1The PETS Act was written to address companion animals, and historically,standardized planning for equines has been poorlydetailed in the literature. The size and scope offederally declared disaster events in Californiawithin the last 5 years have prompted enhancedplanning for mass evacuation and sheltering ofanimals. 2Veterinary integration with local emergency operation centers and creation of mem-orandums of understanding (MOUs) for activationand deployment are an essential component to anintegrated veterinary response. 3The objective of this paper is to describe a template for creationand deployment of a regional veterinary disasterresponse trailer. 2. Materials and Methods The Northern California Association of EquinePractitioners (NCAEP) acquired a veterinary disasterresponse trailer in 2017 after the California Wine Country Complex Fires prompted the evacuation of over 1000 horses into local shelters. Access to an empty cargo trailer and donation of veterinary sup-plies by NCAEP educational partners facilitated a veterinary hub for member veterinarians to volunteer time and services to the sheltered equines. The suc-cess of that collaborative response prompted theNCAEP leadership to seek donation of a disasterresponse trailer for future deployments. Donorswere solicited to procure an 18-ft-long /C28-ft-wide /C2 10-ft-tall bumper pull cargo trailer. The cost of thetrailer was $16,000, which included approximately $4,000 worth of electrical components, shelving, strap- ping, and detailing upgrades to promote mobility andorganization of supplies (Fig. 1). A roadmap to afunctional, integrated disaster response trailer startswith establishing key relationships and volunteer pro-tections in advance of disaster season. Key relation-ships include the following: \u0081Integration with local emergency operations center. In most cases, the animal componentof response is handled by the local animal control NOTES 428 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSMEDICINE II: RESCUE, REPAIR, AND REFLECTIONofce or county animal shelter. This is a good place to start with a call to investigate local sup- port for an organized plan for horses andlivestock. Counties may require incident com-mand system (ICS) training and a swear-in pro-cess to certify volunteers as disaster service workers (DSWs). certi cation ensures vol- unteers can receive worker 'sc o m p e n s a t i o ni f injured while volunteering. If deployed, DSWs can request supplies through a formal ICS 213request routed through animal services. In a fed-erally declared disaster, the county can be reim- bursed for these supplies. An MOU can be drafted to clearly de ne the roles and responsibil- ities of the county and the veterinary responders. 4 \u0081Integration with state veterinary medical reserve corps (VMRC). Each state will likely have a VMRC, and response veterinarians whowish to deliver mutual aid to surrounding coun-ties can comply with required training that usu-ally includes ICS training, response training, and volunteer orientation. VMRCs are acti- vated when the county needs exceed localresponse capacity and mutual aid is requestedat the state level. \u0081An organized noti cation system for veterinary volunteers and a central hub for volunteer in-formation and training. Volunteers can com-plete a membership survey with contactinformation, species familiarity, and license in-formation and be added to a group call-out sys- tem that provides incident information and access to volunteer shift sign ups. Ideally, thisgroup can gather to train and attend continuingeducation relevant to disaster response. \u0081Establishment of 501(c)(3) status is valuable to garner donor support for the acquisition of a trailer, equipment, and supplies. Alternatively,a response group can request scal oversightfrom a local Veterinary Medical Association or equine 501(c)(3). Cost to establish nonpro t status is variable and can take several months tosecure. \u0081Industry partner collaborations. Outreach toseek supply donation channels can be key tomaintaining a stocked trailer. Early in disas-ters, access to supplies via ICS 213 requests cantake several days to achieve. Industry part-ners bene t from their involvement in response and can bring stories of medical aid and Fig. 1. NCAEP disaster response trailer deployed in Butte County for the North Fire in 2020.

Treatment board (A), add-on board (B), and shelter map (C) are displayed at the trailer to allow attending veterinarians tocomplete daily treatments and address new issues as they arise.MEDICINE II: RESCUE, REPAIR, AND REFLECTION AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 429reuni cation back to their company outreach professionals. The goodwill generated through disaster support is tremendous. Trailer inven- tory sheets can be maintained and checked quarterly. Supplies nearing expiration can be donated to volunteer veterinarians serving equine nonpro t organizations. Additional Considerations for Deployment of a Veterinary Response Trailer in Advance of Deployment Include theFollowing: \u0081Standard operating guidelines (SOGs) It is helpful for veterinary response groups to have a set of standard operating guidelines made availableto member veterinarians to review ahead ofresponse. Clear SOGs ensure a common under- standing of roles and responsibilities. Various operating procedures should be detailed such asmedical record completion, trailer setup and lockup,communications with organizations running theshelter, communications with horse owners, andgeneral treatment protocols. The NCAEP has developed a set of SOGs that are available to veteri- narians upon request. These are updated annuallybased on lessons learned from deployments and vol-unteer feedback. \u0081Liability Veterinarians should sign a volunteer liability waiverannually, which protects the organization deploying the disaster response trailer. They should be sworn in as DSWs upon completion of required training inadvance of disaster season or on the day of theirdeployment. Community agents are deputized to perform legal swear ins, and in the age of COVID-19, they can be performed virtually if locally approvedand the appropriate paperwork is completed. Accessto incident swear-in opportunities is included in thestandard MOU for trailer deployment. Considerations During Deployment Include the Following: \u0081Patient care The recommended ratio of veterinarian/technicianp a i r st oh o r s e si nt h es h e l t e ri s1 : 5 0 . E q u i n ew i l d - landre shelter data suggest that approximately 20% of sheltered equines will need veterinary care, which renders approximately 10 patients on the treatmentboard for every 50 horses in the shelter. aEvacuated horse owners are often encumbered with the disaster and cannot provide daily care for their animals. In the initial stages of a disaster, it is helpful to scheduleone veterinarian/technician team to inspect incominganimals, in addition to the team performingtreatments. Scheduling veterinarians with an experienced equine assistant to restrain animals and assist with treatments creates added ef ciency and safety. In many cases, volunteer veterinariansschedule their own technicians to accompany theirs h i f t s . A l l o w i n gt h eh o r s e st os e t t l ei n t ot h e i re n c l o -sure for 30 to 60 minutes prior to examination helps offset the in fluence of adrenaline on the intake exam and improves overall safety. Horses needing care are examined by veterinarians and are added to thetreatment board and medical record system based ontheir intake number (Fig. 2A). A second board for \"add-on \"exams is maintained adjacent to the treat- ment board such that attending shelter care volun- teers can report medical issues to the veterinary Fig. 3. Trailer medications are stored in a lockable cabinet and displayed in green labeled treatment baskets for easy access to patient supplies.MEDICINE II: RESCUE, REPAIR, AND REFLECTION 430 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGStrailer. Communications and consent from the owner are necessary before any treatments are per- formed on the animal. Consultation with the agencyoverseeing the shelter is required if owner consent is not readily available. The NCAEP can deliver care, f r e eo fc h a r g e ,a ss u p p l i e sa n dv e t e r i n a r yt i m ea r edonated. The decision to bill for services rendered should align with the resources of the entity responding. Patient medications can be gathered insmall baskets labeled with the patient ID and pen number to facilitate daily treatments. A map of the shelter and labeled enclosures should be posted adja-cent to the treatment board to facilitate locating patients (Fig. 2C). An isolation area and biosecurity stations should be evident on the map, and sheltercare personnel should be trained to follow biosecurity pro-cedures. Discharge instructions can be com- pleted for animals heading home on continuedmedications. \u0081Patient identi cation It is crucial that patient ID and not pen numbers are utilized to identify patients. It is usually the respon- sibility of the agency overseeing the shelter to assignand tag the equines with individual numbers that areunique to that shelter. Pen numbers and letters should also be unique and not duplicated on- site. Each animal should have a patient care sheetattached to the pen maintained by the agency running the shelter. Patient care sheets should document owner contact information and horse signalment andtrack appetite, water consumption, manure output, and demeanor at given time points. Failures of horses to meet expected normal values on these sheetswill trigger requests for veterinary examination to the \"add-on \"board (Fig. 2B). Ideally, shelter care volun- teers are trained on normal water consumption, ma- nure output (i.e., 1 pile q3-4h), stance, and mentation. \u0081Medical supplies Recent shelter data gathered by the NCAEP suggest that wounds and lacerations, gastrointestinal distur- bances, lameness, and eye problems are the most com-mon problems encountered in the wildland re shelter. Ample supply of medications and bandagematerials necessary to treat these conditions shouldbe kept on hand and monitored for expiration status. NSAIDs are the most prescribed medications for all of the common problems. Equipment to treatmedical colics, suture lacerations, examine eyes, examine hooves, collect laboratory samples, and per- form stall side lab analysis enhance care options. Amechanism to legally label medications and store them appropriately should be developed. \u0081Feeding station Shelter conditions create the perfect storm for equine gastrointestinal disturbances and colic. If diminishedfecal output, appetite, water consumption, or mentalbrightness are reported and physical exam warrants intervention, \"VET FEED \"signs can be posted on the pens. Scheduled small, hydrated feedings can beorchestrated and added to the treatment board until the horse regains normal fecal output, motility, and demeanor. It is important to have access to a suita- ble selection of pelleted feed materials that can be used to enhance appetite and hy-dration. Thesematerials should be secured in a locked area that is not accessible to a loose horse. Ideally, a similar locked area for owner hay should be maintained with h o r s eI Di n f oa t t a c h e dt oe n s u r ec o n t i n u i t yo ff e e di f possible. Reduced, more frequent feedings of owner hay blended to shelter hay as needed are advised for therst 2 to 3 days of sheltering to offset the potential for colic or impaction. \u0081Veterinary team scheduling The NCAEP schedules two volunteer veterinarianshifts daily spanning 8AM to 3PM and 2 PM to 10 PM, with each veterinarian scheduled with a treatment technician or experienced han-dler. One hour of overlap allows for information exchange. Alternatively, responding veterinarians can cover both shifts if caseloads allow. Shift demand is often highest in the rst week of de-ployment and during active evacuation win-dows. Shelter managers or community animal response team leaders should be provided with local emergency contacts for after-hours coverage, which should be arranged at the event 's outset. At the end of each deployment day, pictures of treatment boardsshould be e-mailed to the operations manager and anew board created for the following day by the treat- ment technician. Discussions of staf ng and inven- tory needs should occur daily, with a plan to addressunmet needs. Operations manager is a paid position within the NCAEP. The treatment technician should also inspect medical record entries to ensure completion by shift veterinarians. Ideally, a system for medical record completion and data collection and transfer should be established to track response statistics. This is best accomplished by assigning a l ead veterinarian for a 72-hour shift, with 8 hours of overlap. This structure facilitates orientation of vol-unteers and continuity of care. The lead veterinar- ian can be the main point of contact with the agency overseeing the shelter such as a local community ani- mal response team or animal control staff. They can also serve as the primary communicator with clients to provide updates and document permission to treat. \u0081Tertiary care relationships Collaborations with local referral hospitals are neces- sary to triage horses with needs exceeding the eld shelter team 's capabilities. Virtual case consults can be valuable tools to assist decisions in the eld and are especially important when decisions for unclaimedMEDICINE II: RESCUE, REPAIR, AND REFLECTION AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 431horses are made. In all cases, consultation with the agency having jurisdiction over the animals (animalservices or other) is a necessary step when care deci- sions are being made on unclaimed animals. 3. Results The establishment of the relationships, training, vol- unteer capacity, and resources to respond to large- scale disasters improves equine welfare and commu- nity resilience. Since 2017, the N CAEP trailer has served over 1471 sheltered equines through six signif- icant res. It has been entirely donor supported and strengthened collaborative relationships with indus-try partners, member veterinarians, tertiary care facilities, and the horse community. The trailer was deployed for 52 days in 2020, with multiple deploy- ment requests coming in simultaneously during large-scale res. Additional trailers and response teams are needed to meet the demands during California 's extended re season and elsewhere in the country where disasters strike. 4. Discussion The lack of inclusion of horses in the PETS Act has resulted in poor regional community planning and preparedness for sheltering and evacuating equines. Failure to integrate the veterinary compo- nent of response into the local emergency action plan results in dif culties organizing veterinary care, pro- curing supplies, and protecting volunteers with DSWcertication. The Wine County wild res were a good example of what happens when there is no pre-exist- ing plan for treating mass numbers of horses regionally. At that time, the NCAEP had not devel- oped an MOU with the local emergency operations center or the state VMRC, and the lack of volunteer protections jeopardized the organization as a wholefrom a liability perspective. SOGs were developed (Fig. 3) on the fly, and there was no prior ICS training of veterinarians, which complicated communicationand understanding of the chain of control of the horses. The Camp Fire in 2018 presented a similar situation where the state VMRC was deployed to the companion animal shelters, and the NCAEP wasasked to support veterinary operations of the shel- tered livestock, with the assistance of the University of California, Davis Veterinary Medical Response Team. Although SOGs and veterinary supply chainshad been established, there was still no mechanism available to ensure the daily swear in of non- Veterinary Medical Response Team veterinary volunteers. After 3 years of responding to various incidents in multiple counties, the NCAEP has adapted its training, SOGS, and key relationship- building practices to optimize response capabilities in Northern California. Regionally, equine practi- tioners have bene ted from having the ability to request mutual aid through their emergency opera-tions center and deploy colleagues to the shelters to lighten the burden of responsibility. This kind of planning is key to practice continuity, disaster resil- ience, and equine welfare. The goal of this publica- tion is to share lessons learned and offer a template for the development of regional resilience.

The effectiveness of the practitioner will depend primarily on their ability to appropriately inter- act with the various types of responders to an equine transport crash. Major safety and security concerns are inherent to all emergency scenes, particularly on traf cked roads and roadsides. Essentially respond- ers are reacting to two scenes: the motor vehicle crash and an equine medical incident where animal(s) are stressed, injured, unpredictable, and generally dangerous. The purpose of this paper is to provide guidelines and best practices to assist the responding equine veterinarian to function in an ef cient, effec- tive, and safe manner during equine transport crashes in their role as an advisor to the local emergencyresponse Incident Commander on the roadway or roadside. Methodology and procedures for equine eld response, rst aid treatment, eld euthanasia, and clinical medicine as often required on scene are well covered in other sources, thus will not be addressed in detail here.

Introduction Equines are frequently transported via ground trans- portation, both domestically and internationally, forpleasure, show, performance, work, veterinary assess-ment, teaching, and breeding. aCrashes with horse trailers occur during all phases of transport\u2014 loading, underway, and unloading.bHorses are on national road systems in a multitude of transports including\"bumper-pull \"tag along trailers, \"gooseneck \"trailers, small and large (semi-trailer) commercial horse trans-ports, boxes, floats, modi ed trailers, stock trailers, livestock liners, and even home-made horsetrailers. Smaller trailers are commonly ownedby individuals who are not required to get aCommercial Driver' s License and whose trailersmay be subject to incorrect trailer hitching, inad- equate maintenance, and lack of driver training (Fig. 2). Even professional commercial haulers have challenges with transport due to impaireddriving (i.e., drunk driving, drug-impaired driv- ing, drowsy driving, and distracted driving), human factors, or actions of other drivers \u2014 crashes have included res on board, animals fallen out of transport, overturned trailers, and avariety of collisions. Horses are transported more often than any other type of livestock, since cattle and pigs are normally transported by pro-fessional commercial drivers just a few times in their lifetime; in contrast, horses may travel to shows, events, for breeding, racing, pleasure or NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 435MEDICINE II: RESCUE, REPAIR, AND REFLECTIONtrail riding to hundreds or even thousands of sep- arate transported events in their relatively long-life span (15 to 25 working years). Thus, the sta-tistical probability of an individual horse beinginvolved in a crash with a trailer is far greaterthan individual livestock. There is far moreresearch on crash frequency (415 between 1994 - 2007), causality (driver error 85%), and outcomesfor commercial cattle transport wrecks 1than for horse crashes. There is minimal published dataavailable on the number of horse trailer crashesthat occur in any country, and information on fac-tors associated with horse injuries sustained dur-ing transportation in small trucks and trailers islimited. A 2016 study in South Australia sur-veyed 223 drivers transporting their horses toequestrian events-a total of 55 (24.7%) partici-pants reported transportation-related injuries totheir horses. Of these, 72% were described ashorse associated (scrambling, slipping, and horse- horse interaction), 11% due to mechanical failure,and 6% due to driver error. There was a modestpositive association between increasing trailerage and the number of injuries. The study high-lighted the potential for horses to sustain transporta-tion injuries (Fig. 3) and suggested further study toaddress this risk to horse welfare. 2Another 2016 Australian study featured an online survey with 797 responses to determine associations between transport management and transport-relatedinjuries and diseases in horses. The surveylooked at transport management strategies or pro-cedures (before, during and after transportation)and transport diseases. Modeling explored asso-ciations between variables and possible transport-related diseases as outcomes: traumatic injuries,diarrhea, heat stroke, muscular problems, lamini- tis, transport pneumonia, and colic. Traumatic injuries were the most common transport-relatedproblem, with a reported incidence of 45.0% inthis study. 3The total number of crashes that occur annually are unknown and poorly reportedexcept through local media, anecdotes from practi-tioners and owners, or documented on socialmedia (e.g., Large Animal Rescue Facebook StudyGroup with 15,000+ global members). Crashesmay be due to a single cause or a combination of causalities, including poor maintenance of the trailer and/or towing vehicle (Fig. 4), inexper-ienced driver or lack of trailer driving skills, incor-rect response to the situation, impaired driving, orexhaustion. cCrashworthiness research encom- passes new and improved vehicle design, safety Fig. 2. Horses are commonly transported in a variety of private and commercial trailers for which there is minimal crash causal- ity research, no additional driver 's training requirements, or occupant safety restraint system, thus injuries are commonwhen crashes occur.

The collective result is that horse transport crashes of various types (overturned, off-road, impacted, floor fail- ure, separated from tow vehicle) are a commonsource of callouts for re/rescue response services, and calls to the local equine practitioner. Everycrash is different, thus there is no standard oper- ating procedure that can be applied to every crash; however, best practices in equine technicalrescue do exist \u2014providing the basic concepts of safest approaches to these crashes. 4\"Best prac- tices\" in emergency services refers to procedures that produce superior results at a particular type of crash; and constantly evolve based on knowledge and technology available at the time. Responders in eld environments must consider many variables: safety(for the human responders and the animals), resour-ces (people, equipment, mechanical, logistics), envi-ronment (rain, cold, heat, humidity), medical (stability of the patient, arrival time of medical treat- ment), and unusual situational concerns such asaccessibility, stability, and structural integrity (e.g., Isthe overturned trailer down an embankment? In thewater? On re (Fig. 5) or crushed by another vehicle?). Practitioners should involve 911 personnelfrom the very beginning in these crashes (trailer over- turn, horse trapped over or under chest bar, hoof caught in divider, etc.) because it speeds up the over-all ef ciency of the response. 5Fire/rescue depart- ments have the techniques and expertise to stabilizetrailers and provide safety and security; after all, theydo extrications of people from on-road vehicle crashesas a matter of course. Very few horse owners or practitioners will have the equipment, training, and e x p e r t i s et oa t t e m p te q u i n ee x t r i c a t i o n ss a f e l yo ntheir own \u2014it takes teamwork to achieve safety and efciency for all on scene. In the past, human emer- gency responders devoted much effort to extricatinganimals without veterinary assistance. Sadly, mini-mal attention to the health concerns and status of thehorse was paid. Ironically, this is opposite to theirintense human medical training where the patient isalways stabilized before extrication, with subsequentpackaging for transport. Their incorrect assumptionwas that horses were big and strong \u2014but several hours to days after a seemingly \"successful \"rescue, untreated equine victims often died \"unexpectedly \" (Fig. 6). Today, human responders are taught thatthey are fragile medically and need veterinary atten-tion immediately, and to utilize the \"golden hours \"con- cept to remind responders of the steadily deteriorating medical condition (Fig. 7) of affected horses. 6The fundamental challenge on scene is to balance the need to extricate, safety for personnel, and providing medi-c a lc a r et ot h ep a t i e n t . N u m e r o u sf a l l a c i e sr e l a t e dt oequine transport are derived from the lack of scienti c rigor available or contributed to inappropriate meth-ods being used by responders on scene.

There are two crashes \u2014the motor vehicle/transport crash and simultaneous equine crash \u2014that should be approached in an organ- ized manner. 2. Materials and Methods Callouts of emergency responders for equine transport crashes frequently result in a request for a local veter- inarian through dispatch at the local 911 center. Inthis article, it is assumed that the veterinarian hasdecided to respond to local crashes, therefore, it isimportant that practitioners and their staff beprepared with a basic response plan before that911 dispatch call comes. No two responses or scenes will be the same, some practitioners will go t h e i re n t i r ec a r e e ra n dn e v e rr e s p o n dt oal i v ewreck on the road, while others will receivenumerous calls for assistance. When it occurs, itis best to have some idea of how to proceed. Example 1 When responding to an overturned cattle trailer crash with 50 horses on September 15, 2004, in Lawrenceburg, IN, one veterinarian and techniciantriaged all 50 animals, euthanized 12, veri ed ninehorses dead, and provided treatment to the surviving29 horses (http://www.thehorse.com/articles/14759/be-prepared-for-the-worst). The attending vet was Dr. John Nenni, who described the scene as \"ah o r s e m a n 's worst case sce- nario \"; until 2007, this was the largest equine mass casualty transport crash documented in NorthAmerica. Although he had been a graduate of veteri-nary school for only three months and two days, hefully credited his Boy Scout training for his ability toorganize an effective scene response with local re- ghters, law enforcement, horse lovers, and other responders. d Example 2 On September 26, 2006, in St. Louis, MO, Dr. Stuart Robson was requested to respond to an over- turned horse trailer crash with 42 horses on I-44 at 3a.m., with Longmeadow Rescue Ranch, Missouri Emergency Response Service, and Humane Society of Missouri team members. They deployed to thescene, triaged all the animals, euthanized nine, veri-ed 17 horses dead, and provided transport for 25 horses off scene to a secondary triage location by direc-tion of the State Highway Patrol in coordination with Technical Large Animal Emergency Rescue, Inc. (TLAER) trained personnel to further technical veteri-nary treatment at a local humane society rescue ranch,which also sought custody of the animals. e,fHe was interviewed thusly: \"They don 't prepare us in vet school for anything like this, \"he said. \"I've been a vet for 10 years and I don 't ever get too excited about any emergency I see, because I' ve seen most things, and most things you can quickly solve. But having 42 ani-mals trapped in a trailer like this was your worstn i g h t m a r ec o m et r u e . \" Fig. 6.

The driver of the towing vehicle, a popular polo player, was pronounceddead along with his dog in the pickup, hauling origi-nally 10 horses in the trailer, immediately three werepronounced dead, but others were loose and running onthe interstate. Emergency responders provided rst aid, then caught and delivered the horses to local farmsfor examination and treatment by the veterinarian. 7 Example 4 A stock trailer with 14 polo horses swerved in the rain to avoid a vehicle then flipped onto the left side of Interstate 75 south of Atlanta, GA, on September 8, 2012. Within minutes, local horsemen driving past the crash start a calldown of their saddle club asking for assistance, successfully marshalling a local equineveterinarian and her staff to the scene and six horsetrailers within 30 min of the crash. The author hap-pened upon the crash just minutes later by sheerchance and offered assistance to the IncidentCommander, a state patrol of cer with no horse experience. Although one horse was killed instantlyi nt h eo v e r t u r n ,t h er e s p o n d e r sw e r ea b l et os a f e l yopen the back door of the trailer (Fig. 8) and cut or leadout the other 13 horses, to which the local veterinarianand her staff provided immediate triage and rst aid on the scene (Fig. 9). Almost immediately, the horses were loaded on trailers and taken to her clinic for fol- low-up treatment and shelter. The scene was cleared,and traf cr e s t o r e dw i t h i n1h ra n d3 0m i n u t e s . g Frequency of Transport Crashes There is minimal scienti cally maintained or reported data available on the number of horse transportcrashes, so collecting the actual number of these events is impossible at this time, there is no national- ized reporting system. No data is available from the Department of Transportation, the National Highway Trafc Safety Administration nor the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which are normal venues for communicating statistics and prevention information. A literature search reveals a small pool of information about frequency and treatment of transport injuries in horses and \"in transport\" behav- ior related to research into improving transportation methods, especially for slaughter horses, but is not rel- evant to nor intended for response to crashes. This is a gap in the knowledge and represents a rich opportu- nity for research and statistical analysis. Thus, much knowledge in response to transport crashes \u2014or suggestions for better prevention and response \u2014come from a combination of the author' s extensive collection of journalistic and anecdotal reports, unpublished data from colleagues, training events with full size trailers and transports placed into scenarios duplicating past crashes, professional reghters sharing their career knowledge, actual owner accounts, social media post- ings/photos, and personal reports from veterinarians/ technicians/nurses that have responded to these crashes. Worst Case Scenario The largest mass casualty equine transport wreck is the October 27, 2007, crash in Wadsworth, IL, of fty- Fig. 8.

A total of nine animalsdied in the crash, seven were euthanized on scene,and 43 were moved to a humane rescue ranch.wnership of the animals was relinquished for ad-option.

Practitioners can imagine the chal-lenges with responding to such a large crash in apublic area, with well-intentioned but untrained res-ponders. Seven veterinarians and their staff were involved with the response, including the state veteri- narian 'so fce. 8 Factors to Consider Before Responding \u0081Time: Crashes commonly occur at busy traf c times of the day, in the middle of the night, or during bad weather. Responding to a crash may cause the practitioner to miss their normal calls for part of the day. Does the practitioner have an understanding with dispatch that will provide a police escort to the scene? \u0081Payment: Will the veterinarian get paid for his/her services/medications or lose money? Emergency response services do not charge for the extrication/rescue. For the practitioner, this is a dif cult question, and answers come af- ter the crash. Do you write off their expenses,request a donation to a related equine charity, or charge a professional fee? Opinion from emergency management professionals is slowly changing to this reasoning. If humans get transported to a hospital and treated, someone pays for it; so animal owners should pay for the professional medical treatment of their animals in these scenarios. \u0081Liability: Check the animal Good Samaritanlaws in your state and ask the State Veterinarian 'so fce for legal advice on liability and requesting payment, even just to covercosts. Practitioners cannot afford to respond to many of these scenarios if it continues to require their donation of time, effort, drugs, and expertise. \u0081Distance: How far is the practitioner willing todrive to a crash site? Within the county? Within a certain region? Across the state? If there are limitations, consider a memorandum of under- standing with the local 911 dispatch of ce to provide escort services to the scene. \u0081Training: Do you have training in Incident Command System (ICS) protocols (utilized by all 911 professional emergency response serv- ices) and rescue procedures? Emergency eld medicine and emergency eld rescue are verydifferent subjects and require training to han- dle the wide variety of scenarios encountered in horse trailer crashes. Human safety is para-mount and roadside situations are some of themost dangerous working conditions that can befound. \u0081Equipment: The basic load of equipment neededby the practitioner will include eld medical equip- ment, lengths of webbing for manipulations, andvarious tools to induce euthanasia. Responding911 services rarely have specialty TLAER types oflarge animal rescue equipment (Rescue Glide sledor large animal relocation sked systems,Nicopolous Needle, etc.) However, a variety of use- ful extrication equipment used for a variety of res- cue situations will be brought to the scene by re/ rescue services. Risk Assessment/Animal Evaluation It is important to perform a risk assessment of the crash before proceeding to determine the health sta- tus of the horses involved. Both the veterinarian and the IC should work together to decide at what point the horse(s) can be approached safely for evaluation. No one should attempt to enter any trailer (or enclosed space) with horses until there is safe egress established. Stepping over live horses is dangerous, they will react and can severely injure rescuers. Evaluation of the horse(s) should include the following: \u0081Primary triage, secondary triage \u0081Initial rst aid and treatment \u0081Clinical assessment \u0081Transport to de nitive care location for further treatment and observation \u0081Evaluate the potential for infectious disease outbreak (especially mixed loads of horses) Veterinarians should consider wearing a minimum l e v e lo fp e r s o n a lp r o t e c t i v ee q u i p m e n t( P P E ;g l o v e s , coveralls, helmet) before establishing contact with on-scene horses. Horses can go into shock and die much faster than a human in a similar scenario. Recumbent animals entrapped in an overturned trailer are subject to abnormal orien- tation, gravity impacting muscle causing ische- mia, with subsequent hyperemia and reperfusion injuries.9These factors, over a prolonged period (>4-6 hr) have been shown to cause localized and distant organ injury or death in the horse, andmuscle death and ongoing injury after 6 -7h r 10 especially in sedated and anesthetized horses(Fig. 10; These factors must be considered to pro- vide appropriate and timely prophylactic treat- ment to the animal -treatment methods are well covered elsewhere in the literature.)MEDICINE II: RESCUE, REPAIR, AND REFLECTION 440 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSInteraction with the Owner/Bystanders/Good Samaritans Familiarity with, or knowledge about human medi- cine does not qualify a person as a professional emer- gency rescuer of humans. That is the recognizedspecialty and function of trained emergency res- ponders ( re department, rescue squad, paramed- ics, etc.). Similarly, familiarity with, or know- ledge about horses or even equine medicine doesnot qualify a person as a professional equineemergency responder. However, horse owners and good samaritans will tend to become \"instant rescuers \"during a crash. Allowing horse owners or bystanders to take charge of a crash is dangerous and unsafe to everyone else on the scene. The pres-ence of the owner is important as a source of informa- tion and for authorization about the victim 's disposition and treatment, but not as a rescuer. The veterinarian should maintain control of the situationas the most veterinary medically quali ed person on scene, others will look to them for leadership andadvice. Animal Handler If possible, the animal handler should be personnel with advanced horse handling expertise, or an equine technician/nurse. Remember, most police and reofcers do not have experience with horses -and ani- mal handling skills for emergency situations are a specialty skill set. Lack of training may cause them to underestimate the extreme weight, strength, and reflexive speed of a terri ed, trapped or injured horse. The Incident Commander will direct the han- dler to take over this job from emergency responders when they arrive on scene. The handler at the headof the animal (if it is a safe place to be) is in the best position to advise about the medical status, potential behavior or reactions of the animal, approach techni-ques, and body positioning. The importance of safe positions around the horse should be emphasized by the handler to operational personnel. 3. Results A database of horse transport crashes in published press reports, social media and privately reported anecdotes has been privately maintainedh(with cau- tion that many crashes never make the newspaper, which contributes to skewed data on reportable crashes.) Analysis shows an interesting trend -over half of horses in various types of overturns and colli- sions walk away with minimal injuries (if they survive the crash.) Results were collected from August 1978 through August 2006. Of 204 crashes reported,there were 564 horses involved, and 464 people involved. In over 20% of reported crashes, the num- ber of animals in the trailer was not mentioned or thet r a i l e rw a se m p t y . T h e s ed a t aa l s ot e n dt ob eb e t t e r reported in the media if animals or people died -thus the study recorded 71 deaths of people and 127 horseseither killed in the crash or euthanized on scene by responders. Of the horses that did not die initially,255 had some injury mentioned, over 75% of these were noted to be minor (lacerations, bruising, bleeding). Followup on their condition was impossi-ble to nd or poorly reported. Trends noted in this study demonstrate the following: \u0081Inappropriate following distance between vehicles is commonly due to smaller vehicles cutting in front of the rig. Alternatively, it can be due to unsafe following distances or if thedriver cuts off another driver. Numerous crashes caused by vehicles behind the trailer slamming into the trailer (often noted werepoor re flective markings and non-working lights on the trailer). In these cases, animals in the trailer often received severe injuries, or were able to get loose onto the road. This type,and crash types due to unsafe speed for traf c conditions and road conditions, are very com-mon (23%). Although this crash type rarelykills the horses in the trailer, it does kill people, particularly in the vehicle ahead. Special con- cerns derived from this crash type are the rig Fig. 10. Injury in equines that have been laterally recumbent or impinged by weight of other animals or objects in trailer crashes can cause latent injuries that might not be recognized on scene.

This number of crashes due to inappropriate speed or response (driver error) and inexperience pulling trailers is approximately what is expected from surveysof standard motor vehicle driver injury and death statistics in general. \u0081Trailer tire blowouts are not the cause of crashes, for every tire blowout that causes a crash there are over 100 that do not, iunless they occur on the tow vehicle (2%) or are com-bined with a tow vehicle that is not appropri- a t e( 4 % ) . H o w e v e r ,i ft w ot i r e so no n es i d eblow simultaneously (due to road hazard, poor quality two-ply tires or retreads) a crash more often occurs. \u0081There are numerous examples (8%) whereanother vehicle fails to yield the right of way orruns a stop sign, which results in being side- swiped or T-boned by another vehicle. How much of this is due to poor re flective warnings on the side of many transports is unknown. This typeof crash is often fatal or generates horri c inju- ries for the driver of the other vehicle because trailers stand up very well to side impacts, even if it is so hard a collision that the trailer is pushed or rolled by the impact. Horses seem to do okay in these types of crashes. \u0081Incorrect or nonexistent vehicle and trailer maintenance contributes to many crashes and increases severity of the wreck. It represents the single most important prevention area for transport owners. Non-working lights, lack ofreflective tape, incorrect hitching, and no brakes contribute to crash occurrence, and may arise because the vehicle industry has minimal stand-ards for trailers that weigh less than 10,000 lbs. Federal commercial vehicle regulations do not apply to trailers smaller than 10,000 pounds. Gross vehi- cle weight is the greater of the manufacturer 'sg r o s s weight rating (GVWR), or the actual weight of the ve- hicle plus the load. If the transport vehicle consistsof a truck and trailer, add the GVWR or actual weight of the truck to the GVWR or actual weight of the trailer to obtain the gross vehicle weight ofthe combination. Many gooseneck trailers andother combinations do weigh more than 10,000 pounds and by the book should be regulated, but most states seem to ignore horse trailers for thisrule.Other recommendations from manufacturers,insurers, and safety advocates to prevent issues include purchase of heavier duty axles, wheels, and tires, having two spares for the trailer, usinga minimum of two axles on trailers to match theload, and better matching of the towing vehicle \u2014 appropriate to trailer size and weight. 11 \u0081In this study, unsafe hitching was associated with tag-along trailers (96% of hitching issues) and more rarely (4% of reported crashes) for the goose- neck type trailers. The chains of tag alongtrailers in combination with the emergency brake engaging mechanism are important to prevent roll-away trailers when the hitch comes off the ball. Standardization of the correct ball size, maintenance and checking for correct hitching (i.e., locking the hitch, tightening the nut on the bot- tom of the ball, hitch correctly attached to the frame of the tow vehicle, appropriate lubrication of the ball to prevent microcracks) would prevent this type of crash where trailers become separated Fig. 11. Three horse trailers separated at the hitch and overturned. Fire personnel are making safe egress and access to the horse compartment with tools, while setting up secondary containment with cattle panels. Lack of correct hitching and inappropriate match between towing vehicle and trailer contribute to this type of collision.

Properly hitched gooseneck trailers have even survived horri c impacts from trains (1.5%), head on collisions (8%), and side impacts (2%) without becoming separated from the tow ball - although the horses, if still inside the trailer, farepoorly. j Proactive Involvement Practitioners can contact their 911 call center dis- patch and ask if there is a local, regional, or state team or Fire Department/Rescue Squad that has had training in methods and procedures to safely rescuehorses in transport crashes. These teams may beprivate ambulance services, may be associated with a veterinary clinic or school, or with a re de- partment. Practitioners are encouraged to provide their 24-hr contact information to their 911 emer- gency dispatch center in their jurisdiction so that they can be contacted easily (if they are willing to respondto this type of crash). Examples 1. Horsemen in the St. Louis area of Missouri recog- nized this gap in training and equipment, with the goal of minimizing risk of injury to rescuers and ani- mal; in 2002, a group of volunteer horsemen, veteri- narians and reg h t e r sw a sf o r m e dt oc r e a t et h e Missouri Emergency Response Services (MERS)response team. The members of this team have undergone specialized training in large animal emer- gency response and how to safely approach crashessuch as overturned and wrecked trailers or livestock haulers. Their training and equipment cache immensely contributed to the success and profession-alism of the response to the St. Clair, MO, crash, kand at least three similar situations (cattle trailer wrecks,horse trailer wrecks) since. Similar results withnumerous teams in other states and countries demon-strates that prior coordination between agencies and equine practitioners contributes to ef cient, effective responses for these crash types. 2. In 2012, Alberta Farm Animal Care (AFAC), Canada launched the Emergency Livestock HandlingEquipment Trailer and Training Program. There are now 17 cached livestock response trailers throughoutthe province, housed at county of ces and re depart- ments. 12Connected to 911 emergency dispatch, they can be called out as needed across the province inresponse to trailer rollover and other emergenciesinvolving horses. They have become the \"go to \"for emergency response to livestock or equine emergency or disaster response. Each trailer contains equipment that may be used in these situations including a generator, livestock panels, ropes, portable lighting, various cutting tools and saws, tarps, livestock handling items, hand tools,Large Animal Relocation Sked systems, lNicopolous Needles,mMud Lances,nH\u00e4st Becker Slings,oRescue Glide sled,pvarious specialty equipment, and plastic snow fence for containment and guidance. AFAC andLakeland College 's Emergency Training Centre devel- oped the accompanying training program \"Livestock Handling in Emergencies. \"This course is fully mobile and is aimed at rst responders, veterinarians, and others involved in rescue \u2014teaching coordination, safe response methods, equine handling, and behavior. 3. Over the last 30 years an increasing number of professional emergency responders and veteri-narians have received training in technical emer-gency and disaster rescue of large animals (TLAER) and animal search and rescue (ASAR) for equines both domestically and internationally. Thesecourses are aligned with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standards for Technical Rescue 1006, 1670 and 150 \u2014which includes teaching proper and safe tactics, procedures and techniques for equine transport crash response, extrication of live and dead animals, dealing with vehicles on re, trailer stabilization and cutting methods for over-turned trailers to reghters. 13 4. The Canadian Livestock Transport (CLT) Program is a comprehensive training course and sup-port service for livestock truckers, shippers, andreceivers. The program offers core content for all spe- cies and breakout modules for beef and sheep, hogs, horses, and poultry. AFAC developed the originalCLT program with funding assistance from industry partners and the Alberta Livestock Industry Development Fund. As of 2013, the CLT course tran-sitioned to a national home with the Canadian Animal Health Coalition and was renamed the Canadian Livestock Transport Certi cation Program. 14 4. Discussion The Role and Responsibilities of the Practitioner The veterinarian or their technician/nurse should direct medical stabilization, but should not go into the trailer, pull on assist/extrication devices, or performthe actual extrication. Let the professional emer- gency responders do their job. By taking a manage- ment and advisory role, and a less hands-on approachfor the extrication, the practitioner can plan and pre- pare for treatment options, advise the IC and the owner, and prevent injury to themselves by stayingout of the danger zone. Different from clinical and eld practice, there are many dangers on the side of the road or even eld environment where the veteri- narian is not the \"authority having jurisdiction \" ( A H J )o v e rt h es c e n e( t h eA H Jw i l lb et h e re depart- ment or police of cer that arrived rst) and the practi- tioner is expected to t into the working model of ICS on scene (see below). The IC is ethically and legally responsible for the safety and lives of all personneland the victim on his/her scene. Fire ghters and police of cers will quickly arrive to control traf c around the crash and extricate people (and deal withbystanders and frantic owners), paramedics for human injuries, and nally the IC will consider assisting the animal(s) when the scene is stable and safe. A goodMEDICINE II: RESCUE, REPAIR, AND REFLECTION AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 443risk assessment should be done to evaluate the risk versus bene t of various strategies for extrication of the horse(s) and should involve the veterinarian 's opinion (Fig. 12; for example, if the animal is not sava-ble, why risk anyone 's life to extricate it and why make it suffer? It should be euthanized rst.) The veterinarian will be crucial as an advisor to the IC for making decisions about the animal' s savability, extrication options, handling, and behavior -as well as bringing knowledge of physical and chemical meth-ods of restraint that will be useful to the extricationeffort. Animals are a secondary consideration for responders \u2014while the veterinarian 's primary concern may be the animal victim \u2014but he/she must work inside the constraints of the Incident Command System on scene for everyone 'ss a f e t y . 15Many animal owners will be emotional on scene, while veterinarians havetraining to remain calm, make rational decisions, andhandle the situation professionally. Close coordinationwith the owner can ensure better outcomes based on di-agnosis and early treatment options, or at the least ineuthanasia being selected for induction at arational point. The owner (if present) shouldconsult with the veterinarian for timely decisions as to savability, transport to de nitive treatment, or decisions on euthanasia. Bystanders will offer suggestions that may or may not be helpful -the veterinarian will be needed to sort through thisbarrage of \"help \"that is offered.Incident Command Response Framework Whether a single crash (e.g., two horse trailer runs off on the road) or a large-scale disaster (e.g., commercial hauler with million dollar valued horses in a ery Interstate crash), the veterinary practitioner is justone member of a large group of emergencyresponders. Regardless of crash size, all individuals and organizations respond under a common protocol k n o w na st h eI C S . I nb o t hs c e n a r i o si ti se s s e n t i a lt oknow how to interact as part of the team with other emergency response individuals from county, state, federal, and private emergency response organiza- tions. Lack of understanding of, or respect for the chain of command on crash scenes result in powerstruggles that detract from the response, and when combined with the fear of distressed horses inside the transport, are a recipe for injury of personnel and ani-mal victims. Every equine practitioner responding to a crash or disaster of any size or type should have at least a basic understanding of ICS which will bene t them by: \u0081Knowing how to properly interact with emer- gency the language used on emer-gency response scenes; \u0081Behave in the correct manner on scene for safety and security; \u0081Work as a team member; and \u0081Be considered an asset \u2014instead of a liability \u2014 by the Incident Commander. Example In the Lawrenceburg, IN crash, responders included the county Sherriff department, EMS service, two local Fire departments, Police department, State Department of Transportation, and the State DOTPolice Enforcement, which demonstrates that even in the presence of professional emergency responders, a crash is a controlled chaos environment. In thiscrash, Dr. John Nenni, the veterinarian on scene, m a d eac a l lt ot h es t a t ev e t e r i n a r i a n 'so fce to check the Coggins and health transport paperwork on these h o r s e s .

I ti s always a good idea to contact the State Veterinarianand the USDA/APHIS Area Veterinarian in Charge for large and out of state transports. The basic principles of ICS are fully applicable to trailer collisions andinclude the following: \u0081Planning: A crash action plan must be devel- oped (simple and verbal, or complicated and written) depending on the size of scene and complexity or danger. \u0081Team approach: Every responder is part of ateam and knows their job. Fig. 12. An example of best practices \u2014the veterinarian (with a helmet, boots, harness, and safety line) makes her assessment of possible injuries and extrication considerations. Here the horse is over the chest bar inside a transport.

This is nor-mally a reghter or police of cer that has extensive professional training, leadership ex- perience and certi cations in scene safety and management. \u0081Span of control: One supervisory person can only coordinate the activities of ve to seven responders. They respond to the chain of com- mand for tasks. \u0081Safety: Safety is priority on scene, for both the animal victim and all human rescuers. \u0081No freelancing: Individuals responding/acting on their own constitute a risk and a liability to others on the scene. The IC has the authorityto forcibly remove them from the scene (practi-tioners should normally not be the IC unlessthey have extensive training in crash manage- ment and safely.) When the Call Comes in to Your Office The caller may be the 911 dispatcher, client, or an unknown horse owner or bystander, especially since it is common for horses to be hauled for sales, shows ortrail rides. On-road crashes are inherently very dan- gerous; the veterinarian should not respond on their own. If the caller is a 911 dispatcher, ask them tosend Fire/Rescue Department and Law Enforcementto the scene. If the driver/horse owner calls directly tothe practitioner, they should also call 911 and requesttheir assistance. Preliminary information to obtain during the call is below: \u0081Name and contact information of caller \u0081Exact location and clear directions to the crash \u0081Type of transport \u0081Brief description of crash (text photos if possible) \u0081Number of horses If the crash occurred on a major road, there will al- ready be a traf c backup in which case the 911 dispatcher will need to provide you assistance in reaching the crash (via police escort, etc.). Photos and short videos of the scene shouldbe requested; they will allow you to develop somepossible plans and coordination while respondingto the crash location. At the scene, ensure you are properly parked off the road surface; employ use of flashers and lights before getting out of the vehicle. Horses accommodate quickly to the con-sistency of strobes; on active roadway humansafety standard operating procedures require thatt h e s eb eu s e d . Ar e t r o - r e flective vest with bright colors is required to be worn by OSHA(Occupational Safety and Health Administration)on all crashes, best practice is a retro-refl ectivevest and helmet for personal safety in the chaos of a crash. Upon arrival to the scene, the veterinar- ian should contact the Incident Commander, and the person transporting the horses (agent/owner) to obtain information on the following: \u0081Origin \u0081Destination \u0081Contact information of home documentation (Coggins/health certi cate) \u0081Manifest (large commercial transports musthave a manifest) or bill of sale Because of the mobility of horses across different regions of the country, an important role of the veteri- narian during equine transport crashes is the assess- ment of possible biosecurity risks. (Veterinarians are encouraged to follow the Infectious Diseases Control Guidelines recommended by the American Association of Equine Practitioners (https://aaep.org/guidelines/infectious-disease-control/using-guidelines.) From the Horse 's Perspective A trailer wreck, from the perspective of the animal in the trailer, is very different from what humans perceive. Rubber mats, horse bodies, and divider gates each move differently throughout the changing velocity vectors through the active part of the colli- sion, which will be in fluenced by the structural stability and current maintenance level of the trailer. Horses that appear to be laying calmly are actually very stressed. Recumbent and trapped horses often lay quietly for a few minutes due to exhaustion (Fig. 13), but because their instinct is \"a down horse is a dead horse, \"they will struggle. They do not comprehend that the humans are there toassist. Instead, they interpret new noises and activ- ity as threats to their survival and may panic and Fig. 13. Horse down in a trailer with head trapped in the door. While the horse appears to be lying quietly, any stimula- tion from sounds or sight will cause the horse to struggle violently.

Horses can hear everything going on (voices, tools, vehicles, footsteps, extrication equip- ment) and outside the trailer they may be able to see shadows and re flections \u2014thus your advice should be to limit loud sounds (sirens, cutting equipment) untilnecessary. There are certain apparatus that are extremely loud (air chisel, reciprocating saw, K-12 saw, and chain saws); others (hydraulic tools) aresilent but cut very jagged edges. Once a tool isstarted operators should keep it running; most ani- mals accommodate to the sounds and vibration if used efciently. Generally, selection and use of cutting tools are the responsibility and expertise of the re department since trailer construction materials run the gamut from wood to rubber to steel to berglass, and all require different strategies to over- come. More dominant equines in these crashes willcontinue to exhibit aggressive behaviors to less domi- nant animals within range of teeth, hooves, and threatening behavioral expressions \u2014thus \"horse on horse \"injuries are common in trailers of all types. Their desperate attempts to get away frommore dominant animals can cause further injury and panic inside a trailer, another reason for a good plan and ef cient extrication strategy. Make the First Assessment from the Outside Veterinarians routinely get close to horses to do their j o b s ,a n dd u et ow o r k - r e l a t e de x p o s u r ef r e q u e n c y( o r complacency), they can get injured. Emergency serv- ices actively work to reduce the chance of injury to res- ponders; thus it is preferred that no one go into thet r a i l e rt oh a l t e ro rt r e a tah o r s eb e c a u s ei ti sac o n -ned space. Often, the trailer must rst be stabi- lized (Fig. 14) or moved to a safe area before theanimals are extricated (down an embankment, hang-ing off a bridge, trapped in trees or sinking into water,etc.). In real crash scenes, there are very few situa- tions where an overturned trailer should be turned back onto its wheels while live animals are inside \u2014this only causes more injuries. Horse trailers can come to rest in left- or right-side lateral, dorsal, poste- rior or even anterior recumbence. Fire/Rescue will have equipment to safely stabilize the weight of sucha large object, then to make access (cutting may ormay not be required) large enough for the animals toself-extricate or be removed safely. Approach slowlywhile talking to the horses, evaluating their stressand orientation by looking in a window or other exist-ing opening and make an assessment without openingdoors or ramps to prevent escape. Horses are wellknown to attempt to egress through openings toosmall for their body; a panicked horse lungingtowards the light is dangerous to itself andhandlers. What is the orientation of the trailer? Usea ladder to access the windows or access points on thetop of the trailer if necessary. Ask the re/rescue personnel to provide lighting for the scene for every-one's safety. A good assessment of the inside areas of the trailer should include the following: Are ani- mals dead or alive? What are the obvious injuries? Are they haltered and tied in the trailer? Is one on topof the other? Standing or lying down? Are the divid-ers/gates/rubber mats intact or fallen? Can you assistthe horse to extricate himself from the trailer? Is therea safe way to cut or release the trailer tie withoutcrawling over the horse 's body or head? The re- ghters can make better decisions for extrication based on this type of information. Ask yourself ques-tions based on the scenario \u2014is the trailer flat on the ground or balancing on tree roots or the guard rail?Trailers are lightweight, unstable, and easy to movewhen in an overturned con guration \u2014they should be stabilized for approach and to minimize any chance ofthe trailer harming a person or rolling and moving asa horse attempts to unload. Dif cult scenarios will require stabilization of the trailer and perhaps re-ori-enting it by a few degrees to prevent a slanted stand- ing surface for the animals, to provide an egress path for extrication. In others, it may be safer to pull theentire trailer back onto the flat road surface prior to extrication. Access holes into the trailer should beminimum 1.5m wide and as tall as possible while pro-viding structural integrity, while an egress lane forleading the animal from the trailer to a safe area offthe roadway should be cleared. Generally, if a horseis able to get up, it will do so immediately after the col-lision; if it is still recumbent upon arrival, there is areason. Slick floors, obstacles, and lack of leverage or space may contribute to a horse 's failure to rise as much as injuries and must be evaluated. The mostfrequent injuries reported are head, neck and lowerleg injuries after wrecks. Horses tend to ght to stand if physically possible, then stand quietly (feedhay to keep them quiet while you evaluate your nextsteps). Slapping or stimulating a downed horse thati se n t r a p p e da n dn o ta b l et om o v ei sn o th e l p f u l ;f o r example, short trailer ties (especially ones that don't break) will guarantee that the horse cannot getup. Breakable halters can break \u2014try not to release a horse outside of the trailer without control of the Fig. 14. Trailers often end up on their side, which is very unsta- ble, especially with a horse panicking inside. Ramps, doors, anddividers can be deadly obstacles to responders. Stabilizing with ropes, cribbing (lumber) materials, or winches may be required before attempting extrication.

Beware of bungee-type trailer ties,t h e ya r ee x t r e m e l yd a n g e r o u st op e o p l ea n dh o r s e swhen loaded with weight. The three top scenarios with very high injury and mortality rates are trailer floor failure, horse being ejected from the trailer, and horse trailers hit by semi-trucks, trains, or similar catastrophic collisions. When animals are ejected (trailer disintegration or floor failure), the results are similar to human crashes and usually resultin severe injuries with poor prognosis for survival (Fig. 15). Horses are capable of surviving cata- strophic trailer collisions, as long as they stayinside the trailer. High-speed catastrophic colli- sions can cause horses 'bodies to cut through bulk- head walls, doors, and windows in a macabre equivalent of cartoon characters breaking througha brick wall, but with bloodier results. Animals are often in shock, endure severe injuries and pain, and rarely have relevant bone, muscle, ortendon anatomy left available to make a surgicala t t e m p ta tr e c o v e r y . Best Practices Responding to Trailer Collisions It is easiest and safest for responders to assist an ani- mal to self-extricate. If possible, remove all obstacles, such as divider gates, equipment, \"remov- able\"tack rooms, ramps, and doors that obstruct the exit. Cover windows (which now are holes in theoverturned trailer 's\"floor\") with a backboard or rub- ber mat, so a leg does not step thru them. Preventthe horse(s) unintentional exit before responders areready to manage them \u2014secondary containment maybe set up around the rear of the trailer with cattlepanels, tarps, parked vehicles, or snow fencing to pre- vent a loose horse situation once extricated. Do notremove animals from trailers until secondary contain- ment is set up and traf ci ss t o p p e d ,i fa n i m a l sg e t loose on the roadway, they may cause secondary colli- sions and harm themselves or humans. Have extra h a l t e r sa n dl e a dr o p e sa v a i l a b l et oc a t c ha n dc o n t r o l the horse (or use an emergency rope halter). Controlof the head is crucial unless the animal is obviously nothalter broke\u2014 in that case consider secondary contain- ment using cattle panels around the back of the trailerand allow the animal to extricate itself, then drive intoa waiting alternative transport. Unloading a horse on the side of the interstate under the best of conditions is hazardous, and always requires law enforcement of - cers to stop traf c during actual extrication and unload/ reloading operations. When performed in the dark,the rain, or on steep hazardous terrain, these problemsare compounded. Get scene lighting from re/rescue early in the crash. Once a door or ramp is opened, itshould be tarped to cover the opening, then tied off sothat it cannot slam back into place. Often, gates,dividers and doors will have to be removed or cut even for standing animals to be safely extricated. Doors and metal pieces do not make safe ramps when inabnormal con gurations. If the horse's head is tied inside the trailer, it must be released before extricationis attempted. The safest way to release a trailer tie isto cut it without crawling over the horse's body or head. No one should go inside the wrecked trailer for any reason without sedation or anesthesia,unless the animals are standing and have a clearway out; then it may be possible for a person with proper PPE to go in, cut the trailer tie and attach a lead, then bring the animal out safely. A seat-belt cutter or curved sharp knife secured to a long painter 's pole allows responders to stay in a safe position outside the trailer (a serrated knife can work, but the push/pull motion on the tie strap stimulates the animal and causes accidental stabs). People have endured broken arms and n- gers by advancing them into trailers, thus the rec- ommendation is to use a long pole. A pole syringe can be fashioned from a long pole and ducttape to induce the animal with sedation or anes-thesia intramuscularly, and without entering the trailer. Triage Triage should be part of the plan for veterinarians willing to become involved in response to emergen-cies/disasters. The level of triage applied to the scene will vary with the amount of personnel avail- able, equipment and supplies, and the ef ciency of the extrication. Some transport crashes will be mass casualty crashes from two to 25 injured horses in semi-trailer commercial transports. Be familiar withbasic triage procedures, conduct a cursory inspection ofall animals, then salvage animals that are easiest to retrieve from the transport, have cooperative Fig. 15. Horses can fall thru the floor of a poorly maintained trailer. This horse was euthanized after the crash due to joint, ten- don and ligament involvement.

Primary triage should be conducted in an ef cient manner, secondary triage may be con- ducted at the clinic or an off-site eld hospital for mass casualty crashes. Severely injured horsesmay not be transported to de nitive treatment without appropriate methods for medical support (i.e., horses with a fracture should not be loaded on a trailer without a splint, analgesia, and com-bating shock). For animals that have a reasona-ble chance of survival, wait to euthanize until the owner can be contacted. Documentation of inju- ries with pictures or video of animals before eu-thanasia is wise practice. Bystanders will be very upset that some animals have to wait for triage by the veterinarian. In the Lawrenceburg, IN crash,bystanders offered to shoot both dying and surviving horses with their personal weapons - the sheriff on scene had to threaten to handcuff anyone with agun. Expectant animals (ones that have the poorest prognosis) should be euthanized ef ciently to prevent suffering - based on resources and personnel. Euthanasia and Field Euthanasia Before providing medical attention or euthanasia to a horse(s) at a crash, consult with the owner/agent aboutpossible treatment/cost and prognosis. Exhausted, stressed, and dehydrated animals often lie down after being extricated; this is not always an indicator of apoor prognosis. Some owners refuse veterinary attention to horses even in cases where the prognosis is good or fail to authorize euthanasia. Welfare con-siderations in some jurisdictions allow the animal 's ownership to be transferred to Animal Control or ahumane organization, which can authorize furthertreatment or euthanasia. Check local and state regu-lations that affect decisions about animal welfare and ownership. The practitioner must be prepared to per- form eld euthanasia at the site of a transport crash. Practitioners may be able to use euthanasia solution 16as performed under normal circumstances; however, if there are insuf cient amounts of euthana- sia solution, horses in shock, or venous access is impos-s i b l ew i t h o u tas a f ee g r e s sf o rt h er e s p o n d e r ,t h e veterinarian will need to direct the performance of eu-thanasia with a rearm by a police of cer with guid- ance as to landmarks, 17proper bullet placement, and angle of introduction. The person performing eutha-nasia should be willing to follow the veterinarian' s instructions to ensure proper landmarks for placement of the projectile. Alternatively, the veterinarian or animal control of cer may perform the euthanasia with a penetrating captive bolt gun, or a rearm. In the absence of projectile weapons and euthanasia solu-tion,eld euthanasia may include intrathecal injection of lidocaine into the atlanto-occipital space in vena cava per rectum) in unconscious animals.Whether as a result of euthanasia or immediate to theoriginal crash, it is not uncommon to have dead horses after response to transport crashes, these are called\"recoveries \"in ICS terminology. Navy-blue king-size bedsheets or drop cloths can be used to cover dead horses after crashes \u2014this shows respect and hides the distasteful sight from onlookers - preventing second-ary crashes from rubberneckers. Concerns Special to Technical Extrication for Equines Horses entrapped in abnormal positions (dorsal, pos- terior, lateral recumbence) are subject to a variety of consequences based on ef ciency of pre- and postextri- cation examination and treatment.18Even when a trained large animal rescue team effects an ef cient rescue and the on-scene veterinarian treats the ani-mal immediately \u2014the animal can still die. Failing to treat a horse for crush syndrome and accidentalhypothermia in cold or wet situations immediately afterthe extrication is a common iatrogenic cause of death.Loading a horse is one of the most dif cult and most dangerous activities to attempt for both the horse andhuman. Anecdotes abound where humans get crushed, kicked, dragged, and run over by horses; while horses acquire lacerations, rope burns, bang their headon the roof and metal obstacles, and de-gloving injuriesstruggling to avoid going into trailers. Always stayout of the way of the horse while loading and un-loading. Training horses to load should not be the jobof the practitioner on the side of the road; however,injured horses will need to be loaded for transport andthe emergency responders will look to the practitionerand their staff for assistance in emergency loading tech-niques (Fig. 16). Recommended Equipment on Hand Practitioners should carry basic equipment and tools to facilitate extrication of a horse trapped or injured, either in or out of a trailer (Fig. 17). Trailer crashesare common emergency responses for practitioners, soit makes sense to be prepared. Fig. 16. Challenges with loading horses on the road are many, and unhandled young horses are particularly dif cult. Here cattle panels are used to drive the animal in for transport to treatment.

Conclusion Local equine practitioners are the responder of choice when an on-road crash involves equine(s). Prior preparation and simple equipment will contribute to more professional results; prior coordination withlocal law enforcement and re/rescue will lead to improved relations for responders on scene and suc-cessful outcomes of trailer related crashes. Use ofbest practices allows the responding equine veterinar- ian to function in an ef cient and safe manner advis- ing the Incident Commander on a live horse trailer crash scene on the roadway or roadside.

Introduction Every horse that suffers a fatal injury on the race- track in training or in competition or that dies or iseuthanized within an area of California Horse Racing Board (CHRB) jurisdiction undergoes a postmortem examination at a diagnostic laboratory to determinethe injury or sickness that resulted in euthanasia ordeath. The postmortem program between the CHRBand the University of California, Davis was initiatedover 30 years ago. The CHRB had been conductinginformal fatality reviews on cases of special interestfor several years. On July 1, 2020, CHRB Rule1846.6 became effective, requiring a postmortem ex-amination review to determine the circumstances ofeach equine fatality within a CHRB enclosure. Thisfatality review program is designed to be an educa-tional tool for trainers and attending veterinarians, aswell as a fact- nding tool, providing information rele- vant for developing strategies to prevent injuries inthe future. Postmortem review is separate from a fa-tality investigation where potential violations of lawsor regulations are investigated. The cluster ofThoroughbred racehorse fatalities at Santa AnitaPark in 2019 that garnered widespread public concernand put horse racing in California at risk of losing itssocial license to operate is an example of aninvestigation. The Los Angeles District Attorney 's Ofce opened a criminal investigation into the equine fatalities 1and collaborated with the CHRB, which investigated the cluster of fatalities.2 2. Steps of an Equine Postmortem Examination Review Assemble a Panel of Experts These individuals should have knowledge of the rules and regulations of the equestrian discipline or racingjurisdiction and have several years of experienceworking in the industry. At least one panel membershould be a veterinarian. The CHRB postmortemexamination review panel comprises a member of theboard of stewards, a safety steward, and the equine NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 451MEDICINE II: RESCUE, REPAIR, AND REFLECTIONm e d i c a ld i r e c t o ro ra no f cial veterinarian. The safety steward frequently interacts with trainers on the backside of the racetrack, is generally wellreceived, and serves as a \"contact person \"for trainers during the review process. Gather and Review Information For the CHRB program, the safety steward interviewst h ej o c k e yo re x e r c i s er i d e ra n ds u b m i t sa na c c i d e n treport. Video footage from the race, workout, orbarn surveillance is reviewed. The trainer is re-quested to provide training records for the expired horse, which includes exercise, medication, and shoe- ing history for a minimum of 60 days prior to the dateof death of the horse. Additional information is col-lected from various sources, including racing records (past performances, result chart), regulatory veteri- narian examination records, of cial veterinarian 's list history, and timed workout history. Attending vet-erinarians provide a summary medical record cov- ering a minimum of 60 days; however, 1 year or longer of medical records is generally requestedand provided. This includes a history, physicalexamination ndings, interpretation of diagnostic imaging and laboratory ndings, and treatments and medications administered or dispensed. Copiesof laboratory data and diagnostic imaging may be requested and require client authorization. The of - cial veterinarian also reviews veterinary con dential reports (medication form submitted daily to the of - cial veterinarian), the health and racing soundnessrecord, and the nal postmortem examination (ne- cropsy) report. The of cial veterinarian identi es key training, veterinary care, and horse health infor- mation relevant to the injury event and creates a questionnaire. Most of the questions are shared with the trainer and attending veterinarian inadvance so they can prepare for the meeting and pro-vide the most accurate information. Conduct Trainer and Attending Veterinarian Meetings The CHRB protocol is that the safety steward contacts t h et r a i n e ro ft h ee x p i r e dh o r s et oa p p e a rb e f o r et h e postmortem examination review panel and shares thequestionnaire and postmortem exam (necropsy)report. The attending veterinarian is interviewed by t h ee n t i r ep a n e lo rj u s tt h eo f cial veterinarian. Owners, racing managers, assistant trainers, additional veterinarians, previous trainers, or any CHRB licenseemay be questioned at the discretion of the postmortem examination review panel. Interviews are conducted in person or remotely via video conference or phonecall. Trainer interviews are recorded so the discussioncan be reviewed if needed. When scheduling the meet- ings and again at the beginning of the meeting, it should be emphasized that the discussion is not aninvestigation nor interrogation, but rather an educa-tional opportunity (to educate the trainer and learn from the trainer). During questioning, panel members must remember this point to avoid confrontations asthe educational opportunity is minimized if the trainer or veterinarian is fearful of sharing information. Afterquestioning, the trainer is presented with images from the postmortem examination as well as case examples clearly demonstrating similar pre-existing pathology (if appropriate to the case). Examples of diagnostic imaging that could detect such lesions are presentedand discussed. Video footage may also be reviewed and discussed. Submit a Report Upon completion of all interviews and collaboration, the panel submits a written report to the CHRB exec- utive director, which is then shared with the horse 's owner and trainer. The report contains ndings and recommendations for improvements to prevent simi-lar injuries. If there is a potential animal welfareviolation or other concern, the case is referred for a full investigation by CHRB investigators (sworn peace ofcers). Redacted summaries of each postmortem exam review are posted on the CHRB website underthe veterinary tab: www.chrb.ca.gov/postmortem_summaries.html. 3. Discussion Over a 10-month period, 63 equine postmortem reviews were conducted by the CHRB. Pre-existing pathology at the site of the fatal injury is a re-occur- ring nding at postmortem examination; however, some of the pre-existing pathology is not readily apparent. The majority of trainers and attending veterinarians are agreeable and willing to actively participate in the review process and inter-views. Initially, many trainers did not display good working knowledge of anatomy or grasp the signi - cance of major pre-existing lesions (e.g., palmar/plan-tar osteochondral disease lesions). At the end of the interview, many trainers express gratitude for theeducational opportunity despite the dif cult con- versation. One author uses the technique of motiva-tional interviewing. This strategy utilizes compas- sion, open-ended questions, refl ective listening, and clarifying statements to engage the trainer. This communication technique can assist in modifying the trainer 's behavior (related to equine care, treatment, and diagnostics) with the goal of preventing future fatalities. This approach can initially be dif cult for some individuals in a regulatory role accustomed to anadversarial relationship with horsemen. Given the CHRB postmortem review program is viewed as a fact- nding tool for preventing future injuries, the current objectives include developing standardized question- naires and performing statistical analysis for risk fac- tor identi cation and hypothesis generation. This technique can easily be modi ed for horses in different types of competitions (endurance riding, 3-day event-ing, barrel racing, polo, etc.) or other uses (carriage and working horses). Ideally, a postmortem examination (necropsy) is performed; however, a postmortem reviewMEDICINE II: RESCUE, REPAIR, AND REFLECTION 452 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGScan still be bene cial in cases where this is not performed. 4. Conclusion Equine fatalities associated with competition attract signi cant public attention. Equine post- mortem review programs will allow the equineindustry to proactively acknowledge and learnfrom these tragic events.

Carbon dioxidetherapy (CDT) is thought to cause the release of oxygenfrom hemoglobin, improving local oxygenation. Theobjectives were to evaluate the effect of CDT on woundhealing and skin graft acceptance in the horse. 2. Materials and Methods Three wounds were created on the dorsum of eachmetacarpus of six horses. One forelimb receivedCDT while the contralateral limb was thecontrol. Twelve treatments were performed afterwounding. Skin grafts were performed on the largerwounds on day 7, and graft acceptance rate was deter-mined on day 28. Granulation tissue grade wasdetermined by a blinded observer. Biopsies wereobtained on days 7 and 14 and were evaluated for thedegree of in flammation, epithelialization, angiogene- sis, and brosis. Digital images were used to deter- mine wound area over time. Statistical analysis wasperformed with mixed-effects logistic regression. 3. Results For the larger central wounds, which increased inarea initially, CDT treated wounds did not expand assignicantly as control wounds ( p=0 . 0 0 4 ) . T h e r e was no effect of treatment on granulation tissue gradeor histologic scores. There was no effect of treatmenton graft acceptance rate. 4.

Though this research may suggestthat the pangolin virus is involved in the transmissionof coronavirus in humans, currently there is no con r- mation as to whether the pangolin virus was a part ofSARS-CoV-2's evolution to humans. 1Equine corona- virus is transmitted between horses through fecal-oralroute when an unaffected horse ingests infected ma- nure or has oral contact with a contaminated horse. Symptoms may include anorexia, fever, lethargy, colic,and diarrhea. Diagnosis is achieved for enteric coro-navirus by testing fecal samples, and treatmentincludes supportive care such as fluid therapy and anti-in flammatories. Though frequency of this dis- ease is low in horses, biosecurity remains the mostpreventative modality for denying a horse transmis-sion of the coronavirus. 2As of spring 2021, 3 million people have died of COVID-19 worldwide during thepandemic of 2020. The havoc that COVID-19wreaked on our professional communities will have animpact on the livestock and horse industries for yearsto come. The challenges in the equine industrycaused by COVID-19 are mirrored with similar prob-lems in the swine and poultry production business.During the spring and summer seasons of 2020, theswine and poultry industries faced challenges with labor and resource availability, especially since both sectors have an overseas market. Though contin- gency plans were in place prior to the declaredCOVID-19 pandemic to manage both poultry and swine farms during a crisis period, and despite indus- try efforts to mitigate risks for human safety and health, animal health and welfare, and supply chain continuity, many challenges and extreme circumstan- ces simply overwhelmed the contingency plans that were established. Labor shortages, lack of feed, closed slaughter facilities, and no income for the pro- ducer led to devastating outcomes and productionshortages both immediately and in the long term. Attempts to slow poultry and swine growth by feeding them a limited-calorie diet, thereby providing more time to get the animal from farm to slaughter, was a short-term solution to a long-term problem. Ul- timately, depopulation became necessary, with 2 mil- lion poultry euthanized in the Delmarva (Maryland and Delaware) region in April 2020. Swine and poultry slaughter facilities were closed due to workers infectedwith COVID-19 and a personal distance of 6 feetbetween employees. Pigs intended for human con-sumption were intentionally rationed food and waterto slow growth until slaughter facilities reopened. This tactic increased aggressive behavior among housed pigs and compromised the welfare of each animal, ulti-mately resulting in depopulation. Though horses inthe United States are not typically intended for NOTES 456 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSMEDICINE II: RESCUE, REPAIR, AND REFLECTIONhuman consumption as are livestock, similar to the meat industry, feeding, housing, physical labor, and the intended-use market were negatively affected by COVID-19. 2. Thoroughbred Racehorses According to Dr. Scott Palmer, NY State Gaming Commission Equine Medical Director, after analyzing data on Thoroughbred fatalities from 2020, he deter-mined that the COVID-19 pandemic could be consid-ered a novel risk factor for fatal Thoroughbredinjuries last year. Overall, there were 24% fewerfatalities per 1,000 starts in the region in 2020 as com-pared to 2019, but some shifts in the types of fatalitiesoccurred. The number and percentage of overall fatalities that occurred during racing versus training decreased, which was to be expected since the pan-demic resulted in fewer race cards in 2020 versus2019. 3However, a change in the proportion of fatal- ities occurred in training, especially in juvenile run-ners, where there was a very unusually high numberof fatalities in 2-year-old racehorses, especially atSaratoga Racetrack in 2020. It is assumed thatwhen racing was cancelled and with uncertainty as to resumed race dates, more trainers maintained their horses at the resident farm rather than on the race-track where daily fees to maintain a racehorse areincurred. Consequently, some 2-year-olds did notpost their rst of cial timed works until June, much closer to their racing debuts than usual. Out of the18 2-year-old fatalities in 2020, 8 occurred in horsesthat had never raced. 3It is suggested that some 2- year-old racehorses were denied the usual time frameof training that permits the bone remodeling process,which is crucial to preparing the skeleton for the rig-ors of racing. Bone remodeling after track trainingand added workload is critical to preventing cata-strophic racing injuries. Due to limited racing dur-ing 2020, many horses ran fewer times overall duringa normal race calendar, and their skeletons were unable to respond to intense exercise before the next race. Out-of-competition test samples are adminis-tered by two regulatory staff that collect samples fordrug testing in horses. Due to the restrictions of dis-tance and physical contact between two people, manyout-of-competition test samples were not obtained. Itis theorized that some trainers may have used moremedication out of competition to maintain the race-horse during training and racing. 3The racing fatal- ity rate in the Mid-Atlantic for 2020 was 1.39 per1,000 starts, which has improved with time.3As of April 2021, data from the Equine Injury Databasehad not been published for 2020. COVID-19 isprojected to have an effect on Thoroughbred,Standardbred, and Quarter Horse racing for yearsto come. With the majority of the racetracksclosed to the public during the pandemic, most of the spectator stands were empty. Tracks located in states without online wagering, such asOklahoma, experienced more nancial hardshipthan tracks with online wagering, such as California and Kentucky. Without the bene to f campaigning a racehorse and with the impedi- ment of dwindling race days, the decline of wager-ing or betting on a track, and overall fewer maresbeing bred during the pandemic, all have contrib-uted to more nancial constraints within the rac- ing industry. Many stakeholders predict a shortage of 2-year-old horses for sale in 2023. 3. Equine Rescues When many people realized that the restrictions of the pandemic such as working remotely could become a more permanent option for their employment, manyadopted pets and horses as a complement to theirhome life and mental well-being. During the springof 2020, several of the equine rescue facilities weredepleted of their rescue horses because of increasedadoption rates. 4Numerous people selected to live off the grid and move to a more rural area where theycould participate in hobby farming. This also in-creased adoption rates in the rescue facilities. Initially in early spring 2020, though adoption rates were up, there was the overall appearance that horse rescuesand con scations due to equine abuse and neglect were decreased in number during the pandemic com-pared to years previously. With the inability for lawenforcement, shelter workers, and humane of cers to visit on-site purported horse abuse, fewer horses wereconscated, resulting in skewed data. In later 2020, as unemployment rose and the cost of horse careincreased, it was expected that the number of abusecases will also rise in 2021 as shelter of cers and employees return to work. The increase in number of cases of horse abuse may create an overwhelming scenario for rescue facilities and shelters in 2021.Court dates for abuse and neglect cases will bedelayed, which will delay adoption and fostering, ulti-mately increasing the cost for the care and custody ofa rescue horse. Many of the donated horses havehealth issues that preclude them from a career otherthan as a companion horse, and this poses a greaterchallenge for suitable adoption. Horses adopted in2020 may be returned if family nances warrant an adjustment. Equine rescue organizations face dif - cult decisions as to which horses need rehabilitation and which are euthanized based on nancial allocation. In order to maintain equine welfare, some of the assigned changes to rescue facilitiesinclude more volunteers rather than paid employees,increased turnout for horses to avoid increased bed-ding costs, construction of turnout sheds in pastures,feeding more round bales rather than square bales tomitigate labor costs associated with square bales, andpulling shoes to lower farrier costs. a 4. Survey To determine its effect on horse owners and horse wel- fare speci cally, a group of British, Australian, andMEDICINE II: RESCUE, REPAIR, AND REFLECTION AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 457U.S. researchers conducted a survey of more than 11,000 owners from late March to early April. Lead researcher and independent scienti cc o n s u l t a n t D a v i dM a r l i n ,P h D ,p r e s e n t e dt h e i r ndings at the International Society for Equitation Science 'sv i r t u a l meeting in August.4Dr. Jane Williams, Dr. David Marlin, and Louisa Taylor, MRCVS, veterinary sur- geon with equine nutrition specialists Science Supplements, carried out the study on the effects of t h eC O V I D - 1 9p a n d e m i co nh o r s e sa n dh o r s eo w n e r s . In summary, the study revealed that there is an emo-tional bond that is developed with a horse and owner that is the same as the bond that other people have with a dog or a cat. The horse is considered a mem-ber of the family. Lack of time spent between owner and horse resulted in a negative impact on the own- er's mental health and well-being. The common themes seen across all countries were horse health and welfare and horse owner well-being. The effect on people 's mental well-being is a theme that in gen- eral has become more prominent throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. 4Impact on the horse included lack of funding for board, labor, feed, hay, and bedding. Financial grants and fundraising are needed to manage horses during the pandemic. Key ndings of the study indicated that horses housed at home suffered little impact as a result of the pandemic. Horses that were boarded or partially boarded felt a major impact as a result of thepandemic. In the United Kingdom, survey respond- ers indicated that 66% are still riding their horse, while 45% adjusted their riding habits to include notjumping their horses, not working with young horses, and not breeding for a foal crop. Many of these con- straints were implemented because the rider was a - nancial provider in their family. In North America, 44% to 84% of horse owners are still riding, while 28% to 37% of the riders have adjusted their riding habits, similar to the U.K. owners. Australians expressed no difference in their riding habits despite thepandemic. Owners in the United Kingdom reported the strictest measures being taken by equine estab- lishments, with 41% of the facilities allowing essentialvisitors only. When asked if pandemic-related restrictions were affecting horse health, up to 60% of U.K. owners, 30% of North American owners, and33% of Australian owners said yes. Fifteen percent to 22% of respondents said the pandemic had impacted their access to veterinarians and allied serv-ices, while 52% to 85% said it had not yet but they anticipated that it would soon. 4Given the recent drought and bush res, Australia was more concerned about the future availability of feed. The NorthAmerican horse owners were concerned about human well-being and economics as well as restricted timewith and lack of purpose for the horse. The U.K. owners were more concerned about risks associated with increased stabling such as obesity and laminitis;peer pressure, especially via social media; and the pandemic 's ongoing in fluence on equine welfare. 45. Discussion Two bills were passed into law that will assist the horse industry. As of May 2020, the unemployment rate was 13.3%. a. CARES Act -(Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act -March 25, 2020). i. Bene ts small businesses and provides payroll protection. Instrumental in maintainingequine facilities and providing extra nancial incentive to assist in caring for the horse. ii. American Horse Coalition lobbied for bill passage into law. b. Great American Outdoors Act (S.3422). i. Aimed at getting Americans outside and promoting the health of recreational sports and rides. ii. Some of the bill was incorporated into other legislative bills. Encourages equine sports outside to help eliminate COVID-19 stress emotionally and physically. 6. Conclusions It is imperative that rescues and shelters appeal and vocalize to benefactors, the public, and previous donors for money, supplies, and volunteer assistance for the rescue. Transparency with the public for theneed of additional resources is necessary for the sur-vival of the shelters and the welfare of the horses. There are many unknowns, and the future for equine welfare and the equine industry has yet tobe determined, but a plan must be in place to survive the continued pandemic. It is important that myths such as \"y o uc a nc a t c hC O V I D - 1 9f r o my o u rh o r s e \" are immediately deconstructed. Fear will limit any contact with the horse at many levels of engagement. Seek guidance on how to access nancial support either by loans, grants, or donations. It is impera- tive that equestrian charities that are suffering adownturn of income are supported. Further stud- ies on COVID-19 and equine welfare during 2021 - 2022 are needed to verify anticipated changes in the industry.

Introduction The term equine asthma was introduced recently to unify the terminology of chronic pulmonary in flamma- tory diseases and, more importantly, because ofstrong similarities between the syndrome in horsesand certain phenotypes of asthma in humans. 1,2 Another important bene t of the new terminology is that horse owners and trainers usually understandthat asthma is triggered by exposure to irritants orallergens, and this basic knowledge greatly facilitatesthe discussion of treatment and managementoptions. Respiratory and musculoskeletal dis- eases are the two most common causes of training interruption and poor performance in athletichorses. 3,4Among respiratory causes of poor per- formance, equine asthma is increasingly being rec-ognized with signs ranging from mild tosevere. 5Mild-moderate equine asthma (MEA), previously known as infl ammatory airway disease, is a common cause of coughing and poor perform-ance in young athletic horses.5Studies estimate the prevalence of MEA based on evidence of excesstracheal mucus of around 13% to 22% horses,9and 20% in pleasure horses.10T h ep r e v a l e n c eo fM E Ab a s e do nt h ec y - tology of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) is as high as 80% to 95% in Thoroughbred11and Standardbred12horses racing in Europe and the United States. Horses with MEA present withnormal breathing at rest and occasionally cough,whereas horses with severe equine asthma (SEA),previously known as recurrent airway obstructionin disease exacerbation, exhibit obvious increasedbreathing efforts at rest, cough frequently, and show marked reduction in performance. 9,13Severe equine asthma is the most common chronic respi- ratory disease of mature to older horses, with theprevalence estimated at around 14% in horses liv-ing in cool climate regions of the NorthernHemisphere. 14 2. Etiology of MEA Infectious Agents Bacteria The likelihood of isolating bacteria from tracheal wash (TW) samples collected from racehorses intraining is associated with the degree of trachealinflammation based on cytology. 15,16Isolation of more than 103colony-forming units of pathogenic Streptococcus spp. per ml of TW fluid is associated with coughing.15Bacterial species most fre- quently isolated from TW are Streptococcus , have been isolated in some horses with MEA.17However, up to 54% TW samples from horses with MEA yield no NOTES 460 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: RESPIRATORY DISEASES IN HORSESbacteria.17Also, the trachea is not a sterile envi- ronment, and recent evidence suggests that horses with MEA harbor a unique airwaymicrobiota. 18Results from uncontrolled studies suggest that 50% to 69% of racehorses diagnosedwith MEA improve after a single course of antibi-otic therapy (7-10 days). 19Therefore, studies demonstrate an association between trachealmicro flora and MEA in a subset of racehorses, but the effect on performance is currently un-known. In addition, demonstrating a causal roleof bacterial infection will require randomized,controlled trials of antimicrobial therapy to exam-ine potential bene cial effects on respiratory mi- crobial flora and clinical signs of MEA. Viruses Acute respiratory infections with equine infl uenza inracehorses typically cause systemic illness, such asfever, lethargy, and decreased appetite. 20Horses with MEA do not show signs of systemic disease, butthe potential role of respiratory viruses has been investigated using serological testing or detection of viral genome in airway secretions by PCR. Studieshave shown a low incidence of equine herpesvirus,influenza virus, adenovirus, and rhinoviruses in horses with MEA based on serology or virus isola-tion. 15,17,21Detection of the viral genome by quantita- tive PCR is controversial, with some studies showinga link between MEA and respiratory infection withEHV-2, EHV-5, and equine rhinitis B virus, 22,23but others do not.24-26These differences are due to the fact that the genome of minor respiratory viruses iscommonly detected EHV-5: 74%-91%; ERBV: 1%-8%) and tracheal( E H V - 2 :1 1 % - 3 5 % ;E H V - 5 :0 % - 5 5 % ;E R B V :8 % )s e c r e -tions of healthy racehorses. 22,23,25- 27These viruses are also commonly detected in nasal or tracheal secre-tions collected from healthy sport horses (EHV-2: 0%-18%; EHV-5: 0%-41%). 27-29 Fungi T h er o l eo fi n h a l e df u n g ia n dm o l d si sw e l ld o c u - mented in the pathophysiology of SEA in horses.30,31 Their potential role in MEA is suggested by recent studies revealing an association between exposure tobeta-glucan in respirable dust and mast cell propor-tions in BALF from racehorses 11and an increased risk of MEA (odds ratio = 2.1) in sport horses with fun-gal elements detected in TW cytology.32In this lat- ter study, clinical signs of MEA (nasal discharge,cough, and exercise intolerance) were more frequentlydetected in horses with positive mycology culture inTWfluid. 32 Environmental Factors T h er o l eo fd u s te x p o s u r ei nt h ee t i o l o g yo fM E Ai n racehorses is suggested by several studies. Exposure to respirable dust (diameter 4mm) and not inhalabledust ( 100mm) measured in the breathing zone of horses is associated with eosinophilic airway in flam- mation in young racehorses entering training for the rst time (1-3 years of age) and neutrophilic airway inflammation in mature racehorses (4 61.4 years of age).11A l s o ,h o r s e si nt r a i n i n gk e p to ns t r a wb e d - ding experience episodes of MEA that last longer than horses bedded on paper.33In sport horses, straw bedding and hay feeding are associated with an increased risk of neutrophilic MEA as opposed to shavings and haylage.32In racehorses, mastocytic airway in flammation based on BALF cytology was associated with exposure to beta-glucan, a marker for mold exposure.11Atmospheric oxidants such as ozone have the potential to cause lower airway in flam- mation in horses, but levels encountered during natu-ral exposure are unlikely to induce MEA in otherwise healthy animals.34Nevertheless, horses exercising strenuously while exposed to ozone levels comparable to some previously reported ambient levels may de- velop histologic evidence of airway damage, and oxi- dant injury may play a role in the pathophysiology ofMEA.34Horses exercising in cold weather ( /C05\u00b0 C ) have a mild increase in BALF neutrophilproportions.35Transportation of horses over long distances can also induce airway in flammation and colonization of the tracheobronchial tree by bacte- ria.36,37Strenuous exercise results in colonization of the lower airways by large numbers of bacteria (10- to 100-fold compared to pre-exercise levels), suggesting that tracheal in flammation postexercise is expected, in particular an in flux of neutrophils.38However, the duration of this in flammatory response is cur- rently unknown. Etiology of SEA Horses affected with SEA are hyperresponsive to inhaled spores, and exposure to an environment richin molds such as feeding hay or stabling triggers clini- cal signs within a few hours to days.30,39Clinical signs usually resolve within days to weeks of the horse being removed from the dusty environment dependingon the chronicity of the disease.40-42Studies have documented that traditional horse management prac-t i c e se x p o s eh o r s e st oh i g hd u s tl e v e l so r i g i n a t i n gmainly from forage and, to a lesser extent, from bed- ding. 43-45In addition, horses are exposed to higher levels of dust around the nose (breathing zone) than in the stable because of their feeding behavior.45,46 The optimal dry matter content of hay is 85%, and asthe water content of hay at baling increases above25% moisture, dust generation and mold growth rise. 47Approximately 70 species of fungi and actino- mycetes have been identi ed in forages.30,48Fungal spores have a small diameter ( <5mm), allowing them to be inhaled deep in the lung where they may trigger an in flammatory reaction.49Furthermore, BALF neutrophilia increases in a dose-dependent fashion asdust exposure rises.11,50 Horses are also exposed to higher endotoxin levels in stables than on pasture.44,51Inhalation challengesIN-DEPTH: RESPIRATORY DISEASES IN HORSES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 461with hay dust fractions showed that endotoxin and other substances (e.g., b-glucans) exert a synergistic effect with molds on neutrophil recruitment to the lungs of SEA-affected horses.52There is a strong genetic predisposition to SEA in particular bloodlinesof Warmblood and Lipizzaner horses.53Two regions on equine chromosomes 13 and 15 have been associ- ated with SEA, and several candidate genes and pro- tein products have been identi ed.54,55These ndings strongly suggest that, as in human asthma, geneticsusceptibility is an important factor contributing to the development of SEA. Pathophysiology of MEA The mechanism responsible for the infl ux of neutro- phils, mast cells, or eosinophils in airways of horses with MEA is still unclear, with both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms potentially playing roles. Some studies report an increase in cytokinesin BALF of horses with MEA associated with the innate response (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]- aand interleukin [IL]-1 b), whereas others do not (IL-6 and IL-8).56-58The differences in MEA phenotypes are likely due to differences in in flammatory cytokine gene expression,56,59b u tt h i sr e s p o n s ei sp r o b a b l ym o d u - lated by differences in individual horse genomics and environmental exposures. The effect of MEA on performance is dependent on the severity of the dis- ease and the intensity of exercise. Pulmonary gasexchanges are the limiting factor to performance in t horses exercising strenuously, as illustrated by the marked exercise-induced arterial hypoxemia and hypercapnia developed by healthy racehorses.60,61 During strenuous exercise, horses exercise at orabove maximum aerobic capacity (VO 2max). In this context, a relatively mild degree of MEA can signi - cantly impair gas exchanges and result in decreased performance.62,63Improvement in MEA is associated with increased VO 2peak.64MEA is not likely to cause exercise intolerance in a horse exercising at lessthan 50% of VO 2max until airway in flammation causes marked airfl ow obstruction or frequent coughing. Therefore, the clinician needs to selectdiagnostic tools and interpret test results based on the horse 'stness level and type of activity. Mechanisms responsible for decreased performance in horses with MEA are mainly speculative at this point. A study of Standardbred racehorses performing a submaximalexercise test on a treadmill found that horses withMEA exhibited increased pulmonary artery pressure compared with healthy controls. 65The elevated pul- monary artery pressure was thought to result from increased vascular resistance. Peripheral airway obstruction can be detected in horses with MEA by using sensitive methods such as forced expiration,forced oscillatory mechanics, or rebreathing maneu- vers.66-69Athletic ability as de ned by the lactate threshold (speed for a blood lactate of 4 mmol/L) is neg- atively correlated with BALF neutrophil proportions int with MEA.70In healthy horses, the degree of arterial hypoxemia is more pronounced asthe level of training of the signi cance of exercise-induced hypoxemia and lactate threshold is dependent on control data matched for horse age and tness level. Pathophysiology of SEA Horses with SEA during disease exacerbation exhibit pulmonary hypertension and arterial hypoxemia at rest, but blood gas values are not different fromhealthy controls during periods of disease remis- sion.72,73Pronounced ventilation-perfusion mismatch- ing is mainly responsible for these gas exchange abnormalities during SEA exacerbation.74,75During submaximal exercise, gas exchanges worsen, andthese abnormalities are associated with decreased expired minute ventilation and increased work of breathing.75These changes are likely secondary to increased oxygen consumption by respiratory and car-diac muscles, thereby reducing the amount of oxygen available for exercising muscles, resulting in exercise intolerance, as shown in humans with chronic obstruc-tive pulmonary disease (COPD). 76The cascade of events leading to pulmonary dysfunction startsshortly after susceptible horses are exposed to allergens. Circulating neutrophils are recruited to the lungs within 4 hours of an allergen challenge anda r ed e t e c t a b l ei nB A L Fi n5h o u r s 50,77The production of numerous infl ammatory mediators is upregulated respiratory secretions or blood SEA horses afterallergen challenge; however, the complex relationshipsbetween effector cells, in flammatory mediators, and clinical signs are still unclear. 1,78,79The majority of studies suggest a predominant T helper type 2 (Th2) lymphocyte response as in atopic asthma in humans, but other studies implicate a Th1 or Th17 bias. 3. Conclusion Environmental factors, in particular exposure to small dust particles, are common triggers for both MEA and SEA. Horses with MEA tend to be young and exhibit mild clinical signs such as intermittent coughing anddecreased performance that can easily be over-looked. Horses with SEA are usually older than7 years of age and have a prolonged history of frequent coughing and increased respiratory efforts. Exercise intolerance is marked during acute exacerbation ofSEA, but clinical signs resolve during diseaseremission. Both MEA and SEA affect many athletic horses, but the diseases can be controlled with appro- priate environmental management or medical therapy.

This hemorrhage results inthe accumulation of varying volumes of blood in thepulmonary interstitium and airways. 1Veterinary thinking regarding EIPH has evolved greatly over thelast 45-50 years. The advent of flexible beroptic tra- cheoendoscopy (TE) and the seminal work of 2,3introduced the term \"exercise-induced pulmo- nary hemorrhage \"and showed that the prevalence of EIPH in Thoroughbred racehorses was >50% based ona single post-race endoscopic examination. Previously,EIPH had been generally regarded as infrequent andcharacterized by post-exercise epistaxis. 3The initial s t u d yb yP a s c o ee ta l .2was followed by a series of additional reports based on TE that indicated that theprevalence of EIPH after racing was similar inStandardbred and Quarter Horse racehorses. 2,4-7 Horses were regarded as \"bleeders \"or\"non bleeders \" and EIPH was considered to be an abnormality or adisease. It was widely presumed that EIPH impairedperformance and post-exercise TE became a commondiagnostic test in horses that had trained or racedpoorly. Subsequent studies involving multiple post-race TE of Thoroughbreds and/or the counting of red bloodcells (RBC) 8or visually evaluating the color9from post-exercise bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) led to the recognition that the prevalence of EIPH wasgreater than had been thought when based on resultsof a single post-exercise TE. Additional reports ofEIPH in horses engaged in other high speed activitiessuch as polo, 10barrel racing,11,12endurance racing,13 and steeplechasing14supported the with any equine performanceinvolving high-speed exercise.15These publications and others documenting evidence of 18-22 month-old Thoroughbreds in earlytraining, 16and post-race in other 2-yr-olds3have led to the realization that the fundamental cause of EIPHmust be physiologic rather than pathologic. To thinkotherwise implies that all horses that exercise at highspeed have some degree of pulmonary pathology,regardless of their age, when they rst experience EIPH. Such a premise appears to be untenable, withno evidence to support it. However, the presence ofblood in the airways and pulmonary interstitial tissuesdoes have a pro-in flammatory effect, particularly in the face of repeated hemorrhagic episodes. 17,18In some c a s e st h i si n flammation is markedly progressive and results in severe pathology that could be career endingor life threatening,19,20with episodes of EIPH, when based on a grade or score re flecting severity,21tending to become more severe as the number of lifetime race NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 465IN-DEPTH: RESPIRATORY DISEASES IN HORSESstarts increases.22-24Under these circumstances, the affected areas of lung can justi ably be regarded as dis- eased and the presence of these in flammatory changes probably exacerbates the severity of EIPH. However, this does not mean that the underlying cause of EIPH per se is a disease. While post-exercise TE remains the most widely accepted test for assessment of EIPH, it has beenrecently shown that it is a relatively insensitive test when compared to BAL.8,12Based on a study of 102 horses that underwent both TE and BAL after a simu-lated race, about 40% of horses that had EIPH based on analysis of BALF were negative on TE; in other words, TE was associated with a large number of falsenegative diagnoses of EIPH. In contrast, the sensi- tivity of BAL approached 1.0, with 99/102 horses posi- tive for EIPH based on a BAL red blood cell count > 992 cells/ ml recovered BAL fluid and/or TE 8. T h i ss t r o n g l ys u g g e s t st h a tE I P Hi sau b i q u i - tous event in Thoroughbred racehorses and that its underlying cause is likely linked to the physiologic responses to high-speed exercise that characterizes these events (i.e., EIPH is an occupational hazard for horses engaged in these types of sports). 2. The Pathophysiology of EIPH The fundamental cause of EIPH is generally regarded as being pulmonary capillary stress failure.25This occurs when the capillary transmural pressure (P tm; t h ed i f f e r e n c ei np r e s s u r eb e t w e e nt h ei n s i d ea n d outside of the capillaries) exceeds a threshold value. According to cadaveric studies this thresholdlies between 75 and 100 mmHg in equine lungs, higher than the equivalent values in rabbits and dogs.26Ptmrecently measured during high-speed treadmill exercise was reported to exceed mean maxi-mum values of 160 mmHg in some horses.27One of the principal reasons that horses competing at highspeed or maximal exercise intensities are such elite athletes is due to the volume of RBCs stored in the spleen while at rest and the ability of these animals to autotransfuse or \"blood dope\" themselves with these cells in response to sympathetic nervousstimulation. Their circulating blood volume increases by up to 50% as a result. 28This ability to i n c r e a s ec i r c u l a t i n gb l o o dv o l u m ea p p e a r st ob ec e n - tral to the ubiquitous nature of EIPH in equine ath- letes undergoing strenuous exercise. Pulmonary arterial hypertension always develops in horses exer- cising at high or maximum speed (multiple reports >120 mmHg with mean pressures > 90 mmHg; sum- marized by West et al25), with this hypertension widely proposed to be responsible for the intravascu-lar pressures associated with pulmonary capillary stress failure.25However, arterial pressures rarely, if ever, result in increased capillary pressure, whereas only mild increases in venous pressures can result in increased intravascular capillary pressures.29One of the principal determinants of pulmonary venous and capillary pressure is left atrial(LA) pressure. Volume expansion-related increases in left atrial pressure, particularly end diastolic pres- sure, probably exert a greater effect on pulmonary capillary pressure than the direct effects of pulmo-nary blood volume expansion. Further insight intounderstanding how marked increases in LA and pul-monary venous pressures play a key role in EIPH canbe gleaned from the pathophysiology of the left-sidedcardiac failure. Increases in pulmonary venous andcapillary pressures are a hallmark of classic left-sideddiastolic heart failure due to the inability of the LA tofully accommodate blood volume during diastole (i.e.,volume overload). This form of heart failure is char-acterized by increased LA diastolic pressure and leftventricular lling pressure, increased pulmonary ve- nous and capillary pressure, and pulmonary arterialhypertension. 30,31 Horses galloping at high speed are clearly not in heart failure per se. However, the effects of the sple- nic contraction-induced rapid expansion of the circu- lating blood volume on the left heart could be equatedwith a transient left-sided diastolic failurecondition. One of the causes of this diastolic dysfunc-tion is volume overload secondary to a markedincrease in circulating blood volume. 30The most characteristic clinical sign in these cases is a markedincrease in LA diastolic and left ventricular lling pressures and pulmonary artery wedge pressure(PAW). PAW is an excellent, albeit indirect, mea-sure of LA pressure. At rest, the LA of a horse typi-cally has a mean pressure of 3 -8 mmHg, while that of maximally galloping horses measures in the range of50-70 mmHg. 32If the pressure in the LA is that high, then it is inherent that in order for there to beadequate blood flow through the pulmonary circula- tion, the pulmonary venous and capillary pressures must be higher than LA pressure. Under these con- ditions, P tmexceeds the threshold for pulmonary cap- illary stress failure and EIPH occurs. Directmeasurement of LA pressure in exercising horses istechnically extremely dif cult. Left ventricular ll- ing or end diastolic pressure (LVED) is, however, avalid indicator of LA pressure. The left ventricle ofequine athletes is relatively stiff and lacking in com-pliance, 33making it almost impossible for horses to accommodate a large increase in circulating blood vol-ume at high heart rates without an associatedincrease in LVED. Horses galloping on a treadmillwith heart rates greater than 200 bpm have markedincreases in left ventricular diastolic pressures. 34,35 Pressures related EIPH score, BALF RBC, PAW, and Ptm. When 14L of blood was acutely removed and horses exercised at the same speed, the LVED, PAW and P tmdecreased as did the severity of EIPH accord- ing to both EIPH score and BAL red blood cellnumber. Replacement of the previously removedblood was associated with a return of these respectivepressures to their initial values with EIPH signi - cantly more severe than following blood volumedepletion. 35These data strongly suggested thatIN-DEPTH: RESPIRATORY DISEASES IN HORSES 466 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSthere is a close link between circulating blood volume and EIPH. Furthermore, because of the autotrans- fusing capability of the spleen and its importance rela- tive to the ability to gallop fast despite the impact it has on LVED and P tm,i ti sh a r dt oi m a g i n et h a t horses can be athletically competitive at high speedwithout experiencing some degree of EIPH (i.e., it isan occupational hazard). 3. EIPH and Performance As understanding of the factors responsible for EIPH grows, the critical question regarding the condition is moving from \"Is it a bleeder or not? \"to\"How bad was it?\". The degree or severity of EIPH is usually assessed by applying a widely accepted grading scale that was rst published in 2005.21This score is usu- ally based on a single TE that almost always takesplace 30 -90 mins after the completion of exercise. There are 5 grades that can be assigned: 0,1, 2, 3, and 4, with the prevalence of grades 3 and 4 EIPH being <0.1 (10%) in any population of horses that exercises regularly at high speed. 36Several studies involving large numbers of flatracing horses have indicated that a horse 's performance will be adversely affected by grade 4 EIPH.36-38The largest of the three studies also suggested that EIPH was more likely to reduce performance if the grade was3, when a different statistical model was applied to the dataset.36In this instance, horses with EIPH 3w e r es i g n i cantly faster in the early and middle sections of a race but then slowed as com- pared to those with EIPH 2, which tended to acceler- ate their average speed over the last 600 m of arace. It is also notable that there was considerable variability in the nishing positions of individual horses in all 3 studies,36-38regardless of EIPH grade, meaning that horses with EIPH 3c a na n dd ow i n races or nish in the placings. However, when horses with grades 3 are considered as a population, they are less likely to win.36-38Whether they are also less likely to nish second or third is equivocal when the results of these three studies are compared. Applying a population nding to an indi- vidual is an inexact science. Horses with grade 0 EIPH based on TE can have a dark red appearing BALF with a very high BALF RBC.8,9TE EIPH grade is only weakly correlated with BALF RBC,8 with about 1/3 of grade 0 cases being false negatives.8This might not matter from the perspec- tive of whether undetected EIPH could have affectedperformance, as it is unlikely that these false negativeTE cases were severe enough, based on BALF RBC, to have adversely impacted performance. There is cur- rently no BALF RBC scale that relates EIPH severity to BALF RBC. There is a wide range of BALF RBC numbers associated with any given EIPH TE grade, 8,9 and it may be that while BAL greatly reduces thenumber of false negative diagnoses of EIPH, it is nobetter than TE when it comes to assessing the sever- ity of EIPH. It is generally assumed that theseverity of EIPH and the likelihood that it will inter- fere with performance is dependent on the amount of EIPH. However, there is still no accurate way to quantitate the volume of blood present in the airwaysand pulmonary interstitium following a bout of EIPH,as determining BALF RBC is, at best, semi-quantitative. Instillation of 100 ml of autologousblood into the dorsocaudal region of each lung about30 mins before a supramaximal treadmill run to fa-tigue reduced horses 'ability to perform, based on a decrease in maximum oxygen consumption and runtime to fatigue. 39This was in contrast to another study in which infusion of the same area of just theright lung with 100 ml autologous blood failed to dem-onstrate any signi cant effect on the same parameters. 40Each of these studies involved 6 Thoroughbreds, and it may have been that this rela-tively small number of subjects meant that very largechanges in measured variables were required beforestatistical signi cance was detectable. Extra- polations based on the number of erythrocytes in cir-culating blood at the end of exercise and the numberof BALF RBC suggest that volume of blood collectedby BAL is a lot less than 100 ml. In summary, thereis little doubt that EIPH can affect performance in some horses. What proportion of horses might be affected is unclear although, based on the largeststudy, this appears to be <10% of the total number of horses racing. 36The relationship between EIPH and performance is further clouded by the fact that the se-verity of EIPH in an individual horse can vary fromstart to start when based on TE EIPH grade. 41 Therefore, it may be that even when EIPH doesimpair performance, it does so intermittently. Theextent to which an occurrence of EIPH grade 3i na n individual horse is predictive of future episodes ofequivalent or worse severity requires investigation,even though the severity of EIPH tends to worsen asthe cumulative number of race starts increase whenpopulations of horses are considered as a whole. 14,23 Acknowledgments The Author has been a recipient of research fundsfrom the Grayson-Jockey Club Research Foundationand some of the work supported by thatorganization is cited in this paper.

Equine asthma is abroad term that encompasses (1) mild/moderateequine asthma (previously known as in flamma- tory airway disease), (2) severe equine asthma(previously known as \"heaves \"/recurrent airway obstruction), and (3) summer pasture-associatedrecurrent airway obstruction (now also referred toas severe equine asthma). The updated equine asthma terminology has been adopted since the pathobiology of asthma found in horses sharessimilarities with human asthma. 1-4Speci ci n - formation about the de nitions and pathophysiol- ogy of equine asthma can be found in the in-depthmanuscript from Dr. Couetil that is paired withthe present manuscript. This manuscript willfocus on the treatment and management of equineasthma. It is important to convey the messageto horse owners that although equine asthma canbe effectively managed, there is no cure for thisdisease. Effective management involves a com-bination of medical treatments and measuresto control exposure to environmental organicparticulates. Both must be implemented to-gether to be successful over the mid- to long-termperiod.2. Medical Treatment of Severe Equine Asthma The literature disproportionately assesses the effects ofmedical treatments in horses with severe asthma ascompared to mild/moderate asthma. This is likelybecause it is easier to objectively quantify responses totreatments in horses with severe versus mild/moderateequine asthma since the standard lung function techni-ques are not sensitive enough to document any of thesmall treatment responses in horses with mild/moder-ate asthma. However, since the roots of the patho-physiology are thought to be quite similar between thetwo types of asthma, practitioners commonly use asimilar therapeutic approach for mild/moderate andsevere asthma. Equine asthma involves a triad oflung in flammation, bronchoconstriction, and mucus production. Although each of these entities could be treated separately with speci c medication for each of these processes, it has been shown consistently that controlling lung in flammation with corticosteroids will also positively impact the other two mechanisms. Corticosteroids There is an abundance of evidence supporting the useof corticosteroids in the treatment plan of equineasthma. 5-15It should be noted that an inhaled corti- costeroid has been recently approved for commerciali-zation to treat severe equine asthma, which will nowhave an impact on the treatment decisions made bypractitioners. NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 469IN-DEPTH: RESPIRATORY DISEASES IN HORSESSystemic Corticosteroids systemic corticosteroid of refer- ence in equine asthma and has been used as a bench- mark in many studies assessing the ef cacy of therapies.5-12,16- 25It has been evaluated in equine asthma studies with oral, intramuscular, or intrave-nous administration. All the studies except for three16,17,20used horses with severe asthma. The most frequently measured outcomes were clinical signs, lung mechanics (lung resistance, elastance, and transpulmonary pressure), and bronchoalveolar la- vage fluid (BALF) cytology. Systemic dexametha- sone sodium phosphate is commonly used at a dose of0.04 to 0.1 mg/kg IV once daily across studies, withoutside effects reported on the small number of horses studied. 6-10,12,23A u t h o r sh a v ea l s or e p o r t e dt h e effects of dexamethasone sodium phosphate at a dose of 0.04 to 0.05 mg/kg IM once daily without reported local reactions using a product available in Canada and Europe.6,16,20Systemic dexamethasone-21-isoni- cotinate has also been used at a dose of 0.04 mg/kg ev- ery 3 days in a study in the United States.26Studies have assessed the ef cacy of oral dexamethasone at doses between 0.05 and 0.16 mg/kg once daily.7,9,22 a) Lung function. Systemic dexamethasone posi-tively in fluences the clinical signs and lung mechanics in horses with equine asthma in a way that is compa- rable to the responses obtained by turning horses out- side on pasture in dust-free conditions. Systemic dexamethasone (IV and IM) has been shown to signi - cantly improve the lung function of horses with severe equine asthma (9 horses enrolled in a crossover design) after only 3 days of treatment, even when thehorses were kept indoors and without measures to decrease exposure to dust. 12One study reported that 7 horses with severe equine asthma kept in adusty indoor environment but treated with oral dexa- methasone (0.05 mg/kg) reached the same level ofimprovement in lung function as when they were put on pasture for a long period of time. 9This level of ef- cacy is not yet matched by any other corticosteroids tested in horses. The rapid and reliable ef cacy of dexamethasone justi es its use in equine asthma; however, it comes at the price of potential side effects that can be life-threatening in some cases (e.g., severe laminitis). The side effects are thought to be mainly related to the effects of dexamethasone on the hypo-thalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and adrenal sup- pression. Many studies using dexamethasone in severe equine asthma have reported a marked revers-ible decrease in blood cortisol, indicating a transient but strong adrenal suppression effect at the dosage used. 6,7,10,11Systemic dexamethasone has also been showed to induce a decrease in serum total proteins in horses, likely secondary to some subclinical gastroin- testinal tract ulcerations.7Dexamethasone therapy in horses also affects their glucose metabolism, which translates into an increased resting lacta- temia.27Systemic dexamethasone IV also affectsthe lung microbiota of horses with mild/moderate equine asthma, which show an increased abundanceofStreptococcus sp. in their airways.28The signi - cance of this nding is still unknown, but it shows that the relationship between bacteria and the horse immune system in the lungs is affected by systemic corticosteroids therapy. b) Bronchoalveolar cytology. Except for one study,12 there is an agreement in the literature that if horses with severe equine asthma are kept in a dusty envi- ronment, dexamethasone treatment will not decrease t h ep e r c e n t a g eo fn e u t r o p h i l sf o u n di nt h eB A L Fc y - tology.7-9,11A similar trend was found in one study on mild/moderate asthma; however, a larger sample pop- ulation would be required to statistically con rm this nding.20As discussed in further detail in the envi- ronmental control section, airway accumulation ofinflammatory cells will not persist when exposure to organic particulates is prevented. In comparison,there is some evidence that dexamethasone decreases the accumulation of mucus in the large airways ofhorses with severe asthma, 6even when they are kept in a dusty environment.29 c) Mucus. There is some evidence that dexametha-sone decreases the accumulation of mucus in the large airways of horses with severe asthma, 6even when they are kept in a dusty environment.29 Oral Prednisolone When prescribing oral corticosteroids in horses, oral prednisolone should always be chosen over oral pred- nisone since the latter has been shown to have a poor bioavailability and would be unlikely to have clinical efcacy in horses with asthma.26Oral prednisolone (2 mg/kg) has been shown to have some ef cacy at improving lung function of horses with severe asthma,even when kept indoors, but was not found to be as effective as oral dexamethasone (0.05 mg/kg). 9It seems that prednisolone therapy can only reach some clinical ef cacy comparable to dexamethasone if it is combined with management measures to prevent ex-posure to aerosolized organic particulates.6 Isoflupredone Acetate Isoflupredone acetate (0.03 mg/kg IM) has been com- monly used in the past in large animal practice. This medication has been shown to quickly improve the lung function of horses with severe asthma and to have a lasting effect, on par with dexamethasone (0.04 mg/ kg IV).10Unfortunately, some signi cant hypokale- mia was also noted in the treated horses, which has been associated with myopathies, recumbency, and d e a t hi nc a t t l ea n dh u m a n s . The long-acting triamcinolone acetonide was the rst corticosteroid to be assessed in a controlled clinical trial in horses with severe asthma.13It has been shown to improve the lung function of horses withIN-DEPTH: RESPIRATORY DISEASES IN HORSES 470 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSsevere asthma up to 4 weeks after systemic intramus- cular administration of this medication at a dose of40 mg. Interestingly, it has been recently shown thatintra-articular injection (40 mg total) of triamcinolone acetonide also improved the lung function of horses with severe asthma for 3 weeks. 30Practitioners should discuss the potential side effects (particularlysevere laminitis) with the owners and avoid repeatingthe treatment without a long washout period todecrease the likelihood of side effects. Inhaled Corticosteroids Because systemic corticosteroids are associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal suppression, inhaled corticosteroids present the advantage of having a localairway anti-in flammatory activity, while potentially decreasing the systemic absorption. In simplewords, the goal of inhaled corticosteroids is basically\"treat the lungs only, instead of treating the horse, including the lungs. \"Furthermore, although little evidence is available, the withdrawal times are likelysignicantly less for inhaled than for systemic corticosteroids. However, inhaled therapy pre-sents its own technical challenges, notably toachieve small enough particles to be respirableand reach a good lung distribution of the activeproduct, while limiting ingestion (which couldbe associated with adrenal suppression). Thereare basically 3 ways currently used to deliverinhaled medication to the lower airway: mechani-cal nebulizers (e.g., vibration and jet), a soft mist inhaler (SMI). aAll 3 techniques have been used in horses to deliver corticosteroids to the lower airways using vari- ous devices. The mechanical nebulizers usuallyinvolve a maskba n dap o w e r e dd e v i c e . T h eM D I s come ready to use in a canister, are procured from thehuman market, and are delivered using a specializedchamber. cThe soft mist is the most recent technology approved to treat severe asthma using a specializeddelivery system.dThe size distribution of the droplets varies between nebulizers and affects the amount ofmedication reaching the deep small airways; the respi-rable particulates reaching the alveoli/gas exchangearea of the lungs should ideally be <4m i c r o n s diameter. However, particulates of much smaller sizestay aerosolized in the lungs and are expired backoutside. Mechanical Nebulization: Dexamethasone (Sodium Phosphate) Dexamethasone sodium phosphate was found to have a low bioavailability when nebulized with a mechani- cal device, 31and although it did not induce adrenal suppression in a study on healthy horses, it did inducesome adrenal suppression on a small number ofhorses with severe asthma in which only 5 mg of dexa-methasone was nebulized. 32Although this low dose of nebulized dexamethasone was not reported toimprove the lung function of horses with severeasthma, more studies are necessary to optimize the dosage for severe asthma cases. Higher doses have been shown to affect the bacterial composition of the upper airways of horses with mild asthma, but the treatment did not have as much effect on the com- position of the fungal population in the airways as the environment did.33The adrenal suppression in- duced with higher doses of nebulized dexamethasone (unpublished) decreases the potential bene studies using MDIs, it should be noted that there were some changes in the type of propellant used over the years,which affects the lung distribution and therefore dos- age equivalence. The rst controlled studies report- ing treatments of equine severe asthma with MDIsused beclomethasone dipropionate. 14,15Several showed someoverall ef cacy to improve the lung function of horses with severe asthma. 5,34However, adrenal suppression was also reported, even when using the lowest doses of beclomethasone dipropionate.34Fluticasone pro- pionate has a greater af nity for the glucocorticoid re- ceptor and may be slightly more potent thanbeclomethasone dipropionate. The earliest studies have tested its use in horses with severe asthma over a relatively short period of time,11,35,36whereas the more recent studies have assessed its effects on lungtissues when used over a very long period of time (upto 1 year of treatment). 37-39During short-term treat- ment periods, fluticasone showed ef cacy inferior to that obtained with systemic dexamethasone in horses with severe lung obstruction.11As with fluticasone, inhaled budesonide improved lung function in horseswith severe asthma, but it was also associated with some adrenal suppression effect. 18 Soft Mist Inhaler (SMI): Ciclesonide is nity for the glucocorticoid receptor, low bioavailability, and a high rst-pass metabolism. This means that the small amount of parent drug (ciclesonide) that would be swal-lowed during inhalation would mostly stay in the diges- tive system or undergo hepatic metabolism without reaching the systemic circulation. Ciclosenide is metabolized by esterases in the lung epithelium into desciclesonide, which increases its potency by 100-fold.40 T h ee f f e c t so fv a r i o u sd o s e sa n di n h a l a t i o nd e v i c e s on the blood cortisol concentrations in 8 horses with severe asthma maintained in a dusty environment and using dexamethasone as a reference have been recently reported.7The results showed no decrease in blood cortisol (indicating no adrenal suppression),even when the highest dose of ciclesonide was used. Contrary to dexamethasone, the serum total protein level did not decrease with ciclesonide therapy. The clinical ef cacy of inhaled ciclesonideIN-DEPTH: RESPIRATORY DISEASES IN HORSES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 471on horses with severe asthma was also demonstrated in this study at the dosage of 2700 mcg twice dailyand 3712.5 mcg once daily.7The lung mechanics and clinical scores were signi cantly improved by day 7 at the 2700 mcg twice daily dosage, whereas they were improved by day 14 at the 3712.5 mcg once daily dosage. The number of horses reaching complete re-solution of lung air flow obstruction with the cicleso- nide treatment was similar to the results obtainedafter administration of a potent bronchodilatorcontrol treatment (N-butylscopolamine) in these horses. 7Recently, a large-scale randomized, con- trolled, and blinded eld study used clinical scor- ing as a measured outcome to test the ef cacy of inhaled ciclesonide (vs. placebo; 2744 mcg twice daily for 5 days followed by 4116 mcg once daily for 5 days) in 224 horses with severe asthma.41By design, environmental and treat- ment conditions were not strictly controlled, and alarge number of horse owners and equine practi-tioners were included, which may explain how >40% of the placebo horses improved. However, the response rate and improvement in clinical s c o r ew e r em u c hg r e a t e ri nt h et r e a t m e n tg r o u pwith > 73% responders and score decreasing froma mean of 15.3 to 7.2. Interestingly, some horsesw e r ed i a g n o s e da n dt r e a t e df o rp i t u i t a r yp a r s intermedia dysfunction but did not show signs of laminitis with the ciclesonide treatment. 41The blood cytology and chemistry analysis also con-rmed the safety of the treatment as it did not show any effect of the ciclesonide therapy. Additional Therapies Targeting Lung Inflammation Because of the side effects associated with corticoste- roid treatment (other than ciclesonide delivered via SMI), other therapeutic options have been investi- gated targeting lung in flammation in horses with severe equine asthma. Dietary Fatty Acid (Omega-3) The absorption of polyunsaturated fatty acids that are precursors of omega-3 series of polyunsaturated fatty acids decrease the substrate available to produceproin flammatory and in flammatory cytokines. A controlled crossover study evaluat-ing the effect of increased free fatty acid diet con-tent in 9 horses with severe equine asthma usingsunflower or seal blubber oil showed an absorption and integration of the fatty acids into the airways ' leukocytes membranes. 42Although the lung inflammatory cell count from BALF decreased with treatment, there was no improvement in thehorses 'clinical response measured by histamine challenge hyperreactivity.42Another random- supplementation of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid for 8 weeks in conjunction with a switchto a complete pelleted diet in 35 client horses withmild/moderate or severe equine asthma. 43Thevisual clinical score improved in all horses (including placebo), supporting the bene ts of a pelleted diet in horses with equine asthma; however, the clinicalscore improved to a greater degree for horses onthe high fatty acid diet, showing some added ben- ets of this diet over simple management measures. Interestingly, the BALF neutrophilia decreased in the fatty acid diet group but not inthe placebo group. This study shows that the di-etary omega-3 fatty acid approach would only berecommended in combination with a low-dust pel-leted diet over a long period of time. Cytosine-Phosphate-Guanine-Oligodeoxynucleotides Nanoparticles Cytosine-phosphate-guanine-oligodeoxynucleotides nanoparticles are single-stranded synthetic DNA molecules that have an immunomodulatory effectand can direct the immune system reaction awayfrom the allergic Th2 pathway, for example. Theyhave been shown to decrease allergen-induced airway neutrophilia in the lungs, and administration improved clinical signs in horses with severe asthmawhen delivered by inhalation using an equine nasalchamber device and a mechanical nebulizer. 44,45 Although not available commercially yet, this may bea therapeutic approach that could have the potentialto control horses 'airway neutrophilia in the a nonsteroidal estrogen receptor modu- in vitro on equine neutro- phils. 46,47It affects growth and survival of equine neutrophils and decreases the production of oxidativechemicals, 48which are favorable properties to control the neutrophilic lung in flammatory cascade observed in severe equine asthma. However, a blinded studyevaluating tamoxifen treatment in horses with severe equine asthma did not report any changes in BALF neutrophilia and mucus severity and reported only aslight decrease in the lung resistance. 19 Hydrosoluble Curcumin Am o d i ed hydrosoluble curcumin derivate, modi ed for inhalation delivery, has been tested in horses with severe equine asthma either when kept in a dustyenvironment or after induction of lung in flammation with severe equine asthma kept in the dustyenvironment, but not after the LPS challenge. Theproduction of reactive oxygen products was neverthe-less decreased in the latter case. Further studies arenecessary to assess the value of this compound in the treatment of equine asthma. Bronchodilators It is important to not rely solely on bronchodilation when implementing a therapeutic plan for equine asthma since this approach has been shown to wor-IN-DEPTH: RESPIRATORY DISEASES IN HORSES 472 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSsen asthma control and increase mortality in people.51Indeed, the use of bronchodilators without decreasing exposure to dust has the potential to increase the number of organic particles reaching the lower airways, triggering an increased in flammatory response.52One study evaluating horses with severe equine asthma treated only with an inhaled broncho- dilator (salmeterol) for 3 months while kept indoorsreported that horses experienced disease exacerba- tions after 8 weeks of treatment.52Bronchodilators should be used as a third therapeutic line after envi- ronmental changes and corticosteroids. The author only uses bronchodilators in combination with cortico- steroids and only as a short-term rescue approach torelieve respiratory symptoms in the most severe equine asthma cases. Research trials assessing bronchodilators in equine medicine have primarily evaluated both relief of the bronchoconstriction and the duration of these effects. The beta-2 adrenergicagonists are available as short- or long-acting prod- u c t sa n dh a v eb e e nr e p o r t e dt oh a v ear a p i do n s e to f action, whereas the muscarinic cholinergic antago-nists have a slow onset of action (up to 1 hour). This manuscript will focus on bronchodilators relevant to equine practice and not cover the medications thatare used in research or are not easily available. Beta-2 Adrenergic Agonists The most-studied effect was rst shown in ponies with severe equine asthma, 53which was then con rmed using a clinical scoring in a large eld study of horses with severe equine asthma treated with oral clenbu- terol (0.8-3.2 mg/kg twice daily).54Systemic adminis- tration can be associated with side effects that are dose dependent and include sweating, tachycardia, and anxiety.55Furthermore, the internalization of beta-2 adrenoreceptors time.56However, this down-regulation effect is reduced when dexamethasone is added to the treat-ment protocol in conjunction with clenbuterol.56Oral administration of clenbuterol does not have the idealpharmacokinetics to be used in horses with respiratory distress since it has a delayed onset of action. It is cur- rently recommended that clenbuterol therapy be usedfor a short period of time in combination with corticoste- roids and in conjunction with appropriate environmen- tal management aimed at reducing aerosolizedallergens. Short-acting beta-2 adrenergic used in equine medicine albuterol and/or salbutamol. The duration of the bronchodila-tory effects of these drugs are only 30 to 60 minutes. 57,58 However, because of their rapid onset of action (maxi-mal bronchodilation within 5 minutes),58,59these drugs are effective for clinical cases in respiratory distresswhere a quick relief is indicated. Administration ofalbuterol using an MDI and two different devices has been shown to have a quite similar bronchodilatory response. 59Currently, it is recommended to use acommercially available delivery device (nasal applica- tion with a chamberc) for delivery of albuterol using an M D Ia st h i st e n d st oh a v eab e t t e re f cacy as re flected by the reduced number of mal available device and an MDI with hy-drofluoroalkane propellant, the dose necessary to obtain maximal bronchodilation is 540 mcg (6 puffs) on average. Levalbuterol is the R-enan- tiomer of the racemic albuterol and does not have the potential adverse effects of the S-enantiomer(at least in vitro), while providing a duration of effect of 120 minutes in horses with severe equine asthma. 57This is still a much shorter duration of effect than in humans, where bronchodilation lasts for 6 hours, and is still too short to be practical as the sole medical treatment for horses with severe equine asthma. Salmeterol is a long-acting beta-2 adrenergic agonist that showed some effectivebronchodilation in horses with severe equine asthma for approximately 6 hours.60However, the onset of action is slow, taking up to 60 minutes for effects to occur,60making salmeterol less prac- tical of an emergency treatment option respiratory distress. Muscarinic Cholinergic Antagonists Theflagship of muscarinic cholinergic antagonists is atropine. However, because of the many side effects associated with systemic administration of this drug, inhaled formulations of modi ed atropine compounds are used instead. The only muscarinic cholinergic an- tagonist recommended for use in horses is ipratropium, which is available as an MDI. Commercially avail- able options for human use include bare ipratropiumsolutions, MDIs, dry powder, and SFIs. Most of the studies on horses with severe equine asthma used the dry powder formulation, and it was quickly effective asa bronchodilator at rest. It did not provide any bene - cial effect during exercise. 61This was also the case for healthy horses treated with this drug, likelybecause the horses were already at maximal exercise- induced bronchodilation and did not bene tf r o mt h e ipratropium intervention.61-63Some side effects (decreased gastrointestinal sounds and oral dryness) c a nb ee x p e c t e di nh o r s e sa f t e rn e b u l i z a t i o no fi p r a -tropium solution.64This may not be the case when administration is done with MDIs, but it remains to beconrmed. The duration of action of ipratropium in horses with severe equine asthma has been reported to be between 4 and 6 hours, varying a great deal between horses.64It is interesting to note that ipra- tropium seems to have a greater bronchodilatory effect on the larger airways than on the small peripheral airways.64Revatropate is another muscarinic cholin- ergic antagonist that has been evaluated in horseswith severe equine asthma with the aim to decreasethe potential side effects associated with ipratropium solution nebulization. 64The improvements in lung function obtained with revatropate and anIN-DEPTH: RESPIRATORY DISEASES IN HORSES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 473ipratropium solution were similar, but the revatro- pate induced further clinical scoring improvementprobably because it induced some more peripheral air-ways 'bronchodilation. 64Revatropate, however, is not commercially available. 3. Medical Treatment of Mild/Moderate Equine Asthma As mentioned above, because few technologies are sensitive enough to objectively measure the lung func- tion of horses with mild/moderate asthma, clinical tri-als evaluating medical therapy for this diseaseprocess are scarce. Most of the information de-scribed above for severe equine asthma is used empir-ically in mild/moderate equine asthma clinicalcases. There are, however, a few exceptions, and afew controlled studies have addressed the clinical ef - cacy of some medications in mild/moderate equine asthma horses. Sodium cromoglycate, a mast cell stabilizer, improved the clinical signs in a controlledstudy with 12 racehorses assessed for poor perform-ance and abnormal respiratory signs at a high dose of200 mg nebulized twice daily. 65The effect of this treatment on the performance of those horses was notreported, but the study showed a potential bene cial effect for horses with increased mast cells in theBALF. It may be indicated in cases where a propor-tion of mast cells is seen degranulating at the BALFcytological analysis. Airway hypersensitivity andhyperresponsiveness are hallmarks of asthma and can be objectively documented using the response to standardized bronchoprovocative challenges (such aswith increasing doses of histamine). One studyusing a randomized crossover design in dexamethasone fluticasone propi- onate both decreased airway hypersensitivity andhyperresponsiveness after treatment, butwithout effect on BALF cytology. 20This con rmed that in thetreatment of mild/moderate equine asthma. Inanother study, horses with moderate equine asthma that were kept in a dusty environment had an allergic immunological signature (shown by an increase in IL-17 expression in the BALF). As expected, systemicdexamethasone therapy effectively decreased the cyto-kine expression of lung cells from the horses; the BALFcytology, however, was not signi cantly affected. 17 This shows that similar to severe equine asthma, adusty environment impedes the clearance of in flamma- tory cells in the lungs of horses with mild/moderateequine asthma, even when treated with corticosteroids.The bene t of bronchodilators over corticosteroids as treatment for horses with mild/moderate equine asthma was not reported when measuring the horses ' aerobic capacity assessed by measuring peak oxygen consumption during exercise to fatigue (VO 2peak).16It therefore appears that once horses have improved thelung in flammation by environmental and corticoste- roids therapy, bronchodilators would not add to theiraerobic capacity, similar to what has been found inhealthy horses. 16,624. Environmental Measures Organic dust plays a key role in the pathogenesis of equine asthma (see in-depth manuscript from Dr. Couetil in this AAEP session). Clinical re-sponse to a moldy hay challenge has been used for decades and is included in the de nition criteria that assist in distin- guishing mild/moderate from severe equine asthma.66 Horses with severe equine asthma will show some bronchoconstriction, sometimes within hours, after ex- posure to moldy hay, which translates into clinical signs of labored breathing at rest.66When a moldy hay challenge is repeated in horses with severe equineasthma, their lung function deteriorates in a predict- able manner after each challenge,67contributing to the wide use of the moldy hay challenge as a model inresearch for severe equine asthma. Horses with mild/ moderate equine asthma will present with abnormal respiratory tract clinical signs at rest but with noincrease in respiratory effort after the challenge. Environmental air quality, however, seems to be equally important for mild/moderate equine asthma. 16It has been known for a long time that bringing horses indoors in an environment withoutmeasures to limit dust exposure will trigger an in flux of neutrophils in both healthy and severe equineasthma horses; the in flammatory response can reach extreme levels in research horses known to have con-sistently severe equine asthma (> 71% to > 27% BALF neutrophils in healthy horses). 68 Improvement in air quality has an overriding effect over treatments with corticosteroids in horses with mild/moderate equine asthma,16as well as in horses with severe equine asthma.69Keeping horses with severe equine asthma indoors, but combined with measures to decrease exposure to hay and bedding dust, improves clinical signs in horses with severe equine asthma within 3 days.69There is a strong agreement in the literature, however, that except forthe particular case of pasture-associated severe equine asthma,70,71several weeks of pasture will pro- vide the lowest level of lung airway obstruction andinflammation.69,72- 75In areas where pasture-associ- ated severe equine asthma is prevalent, horses pas-tured are also susceptible to have seasonal moderate and severe lung in flammation, with up to 87% of horses in a teaching herd having at least some mild lung in flammation during the winter.76Assessing air quality is usually performed with measurementsof airborne particulates, with particular attention to those of a size that can reach the lower airways (i.e., respirable dust). Aerosols can be divided into 3 cate- gories regarding their deposition in the respiratory system, and based on human data, it is accepted that 50% of the particulates in each category will achieve the following distributions: the inhalable, the thoracic, and the respirable fraction. Fifty percent of the partic- ulates with 100 microns diameter will be inhalable (deposit in the respiratory tract, extra-thoracic), 50% with 10 microns diameter will be thoracic (deposit inIN-DEPTH: RESPIRATORY DISEASES IN HORSES 474 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSconducting airways), and 50% with 4 microns diame- ter will be respirable (deposit in the gas exchange/ alveoli of the lung). It was recognized early on thatactivities such as mucking or sweeping alleys in barnscontribute to the concentration of total and respirable dust. 77It is important, however, to note that breath- ing zone concentration for particulates is more rele- vant than barn concentration78,79and that there is no correlation between the two zones 'dust concentration.80This is also emphasized since there is a great variability between horses 'exposure to dust when stabled80as some horses may be pacing in their stall or have other habits that favor dustaerosolization. In addition to airborne dust concen- tration, attention should be paid to the composition of the dust and in particular its concentration of endo-toxins and beta-glucan. 81-86Standardized hay dust suspension has been used to challenge horses, and although it triggered a lung neutrophilia in horses with severe equine asthma (and a signi cantly lower response in healthy horses), the challenge did notinduce clinical signs associated with bron- choconstriction.84Importantly, all dusts are not equal,83and there is a synergistic effect between or- ganic dust concentration, endotoxin,83and beta glu- can content.82A longitudinal study in a racing barn with moderate levels of airborne dust found that the concentrations in beta-glucans and endotoxins werenot proportional to the total dust concentration; fur-thermore, there was an opposite seasonal increasebetween the two components as the beta-glucans were greater in the winter and the endotoxins were greater in the summer. 81Therefore, variability in those three critical dust components cannot be considered tobe correlated. There is a clear agreement between studies that improving hay and bedding conditions will have a dramatic effect to reduce airbornedust. For example, when horses were switched froma conventional management with straw bedding and hay to a low-dust management with wood shavings and pelleted diet, not only did the area respirable par-ticulates decrease by 50%, but more importantly, thebreathing zone respirable fraction also had only 3% of the dust measured with the conventional management. 78However, between the hay and the bedding, the forage has a greater impact on the respi-rable dust and endotoxin concentrations in thebreathing zone of horses than the bedding. 78,87- 89 Hay Fungi are found in hay and bedding and play a critical role in the pathophysiology of severe equine e r ed o n ea l m o s t3 0y e a r sa g ot oa s s e s st h eb r o n -choconstrictive response of horses with severe equineasthma. 90A European retrospective study showed that horses were 2 times more likely to have mild/ moderate equine asthma when fungal elements were observed in the transtracheal wash cytology.91Asmentioned above, endotoxins are also important, and h a y l a g ei sa ne f f e c t i v em e t h o dt od e c r e a s ee n d o t o x i nc o n c e n t r a t i o ni nt h ea i r . 87However, it is not practi- cal for all areas, and when hay is used, the type of for-a g ea n dt h et i m i n go fi t sh a r v e s ta n ds t o r a g econditions are also important; late-harvest, second-cut hay stored in a dry environment is recommended to decrease the dust and fungi content. 92In any case, hay nets should also be avoided as they have b e e ns h o w nt oi n c r e a s ee x p o s u r et od u s ti nr a c i n gstables, 80and respirable dust exposure is associated with lung eosinophilia.93Many hay options have been tested regarding hay handling in barns, all aimed at decreasing the respiratory risk associated with feeding unprocessed hay. Simply immersinghay in water resulted in a 60% decrease in respirabledust concentration, but it seems that soaking hay for30 minutes may be the most bene cial approach with a reduction by 90%. 89,94However, a detailed analysis of the dust composition was not provided in those studies. There is a clear consensus among studies that steaming hay decreases bacterial and mold con-tent; 95,96however, its effect on endotoxin exposure has not yet been described. Steamed hay is appetentand increases the dry matter intake of thehorses. 97There are few data on the clinical ef cacy of hay steaming in severe equine asthma horses. A study using a very small group of horses with severe equine asthma reported some bene ts on mucus scor- ing, inhaled fraction, and exposure to endotoxins;95 however, the study did not have enough power to de - nitely conclude that steamed hay improved clinicalsigns in severe equine asthma. Pelleted hay has been used as a reference in clinical trials, with an oil- mixed hay system shown to have equivalentefcacy. 98Lung mechanics were improved after only 6 days and remained improved for the 93 days of thestudy, while mucus score improved after 13 days andairway neutrophilia improved after 65 days of the oil-mixed hay system diet. Bedding Many studies have also assessed a variety of beddings to decrease ambient and breathing zone particulates in horses. It is usually accepted that wood shavingsa r eap r a c t i c a la n de f f e c t i v em e t h o dt od e c r e a s ea m b i -e n td u s ti nb a r n s ; 78however, it should be kept in mind that excellent quality straw can have similarbenets. 99Wood shavings are often more practi- cal and easier to obtain than the best-qualitystraw. Wood shavings combined with grass hay-lage are effective at maintaining horses withsevere equine asthma free of symptoms even whenkept indoors. 100Newspaper and cardboard bed- ding have been proposed as horse beddingoptions. 101,102Cardboard bedding was effective at maintaining horses with severe equine asthma inremission while kept indoors on grass silage. 102IN-DEPTH: RESPIRATORY DISEASES IN HORSES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 475Ambient Temperature Heat (25 8C) in the barns may worsen severe equine asthma as compared to warm temperature (18\u00b0C), sup- porting the possibility that cold temperature could be considered to help with uncontrolled severe equine asthma cases.103 5. Conclusion In conclusion, environmental management of dust is important to successfully maintain horses with severe equine asthma free of symptoms and free of lung inflammation. Although it may be dif cult to convince horse owners that these environmental measures are more important than medication, such discussions areworth the veterinarian 's time since owners who try to apply some measures do perceive a clear improvementin clinical signs. 104Antigen avoidance measures alone have also been shown to be bene cial over the long term as not only do they control lung infl ammation, but they also decrease bronchial smooth muscle mass.38 Unfortunately, it is sometimes discouraging to see thatre-exposure to dust affects lung mechanics within onlya few days of exposure, so dust-free management should be an all-year-long, long-term commitment. 100 Acknowledgments Funding Sources T h eA u t h o rw o u l dl i k et ot h a n kt h eC a l g a r yC h a i ri n Equine Sports Medicine at the University of Calgaryfor its support.

Introduction Esophageal disorders occur with relative frequency in equine practice, the most common being esophagealobstructions.1While most esophageal obstructions are transient and require no imaging diagnostics, incases with a history of dysphagia, recurrent esopha-geal obstruction, or other esophageal disease, anesophagram may provide important diagnosticinformation. Esophagrams are particularly indicatedin cases of recurrent obstruction since these are morefrequently associated with underlying morphological orfunctional esophageal disturbances. 2These may include, but are not limited to, stricture formation, diverticula, and motility disturbances. Less fre- quently, obstruction can result from extra-esophagealsources such as neoplastic masses andabscesses. Clinical signs of esophageal diseasemay include nasal discharge containing saliva/food, signs of dysphagia such as quidding/drop-ping food and delayed eating, gagging, and cough-ing, although more vague presentations suchas anxiety and anorexia may also beseen. 3Esophageal perforation and rupture sec- ondary to both intraluminal obstruction andexternal trauma have also been reported withinthe literature. 4,5Indicators of esophageal rup- ture can include swel-ling crepitus, cellulitis, andpotential drainage. 4Cases of esophageal perfo- ration may present with colic signs and pleuraleffusion, and this should always be considered asa differential diagnosis for such cases.5 An esophagram can be performed safely and effec- tively and can often be acquired using portable x-rayequipment. It allows assessment of esophageal in-tegrity and morphology and is a helpful complement to esophagoscopy in the investigation of equine esoph- ageal disorders. Although fluoroscopic dynamic esophagrams are reported within the literature,because fluoroscopy is not available for most practi- tioners, this article will focus on the acquisition of astatic radiographic esophagram. 2. Materials and Methods Timing Passage of a nasoesophageal tube and/or endoscope can cause esophageal dilation and optimally wouldnot be performed immediately prior to the exam. Ifchemical restraint was used to facilitate prior nasoe-sophageal tube placement, the interval before theesophagram should be at least 30 minutes. 6 Sedation If possible, sedation of the patient for radiograph ac-quisition should be avoided due to reported effects onesophageal motility. 7,8If sedation is required, the authors have used low-dose xylazine (0.2- 0.4 mg/kg)1 to safely acquire diagnostic images. NOTES AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 479IMAGINGSurvey Radiographs Prior to contrast administration, standing right-to-left laterolateral radiographs should be obtained. A com- plete radiographic examination of the esophagus should include the pharynx, cervical, thoracic, and ab- dominal esophagus. Images should be to the mandible, esophagus dorsal to the heart, and abdominalesophagus at the level of the dorsal diaphragm (Fig. 1). For radiography of the esophagus in an adult horse, exposures in the region of 80 to 120 kVp and 4 to 60 mAs are required, dependent on the radio- graphic system used. Due to the dorsal position of the esophagus within the thorax, it is usually possible to perform diagnostic studies with portable radio- graphic systems. Acquisition of survey radiographs is important, rst, since they may themselves reveal esophageal abnormalities including any pre-existing gas or fluid dilation and, second, because they enable practitioners to optimize radiographic techniquebefore contrast administration. Foals may be radiographed in left lateral recum- bency for ease of restraint, although in such cases,contrast medium should be limited to barium paste to reduce the risk of aspiration (Fig. 2). 9 Contrast Selection Liquid barium is the most frequently used contrast agent for esophagrams. In the majority of cases at the authors' institution, 60% w/v barium suspension2 is utilized. However, in cases where esophageal per-foration is suspected, nonionic iodinated contrast media should be used in place of barium since the lat- ter has been associated with mediastinitis. If liquid barium does not identify a lesion consistent with theclinical suspicion, or in horses in which failure of patient compliance precludes intubation, barium mayb em i x e dw i t hf e e da n do f f e r e dt ot h eh o r s e . A slurry/mash can be made of pelleted feed and 350 mL60% w/v barium suspension. Contrast Administration Liquid contrast can be administered via 60-mL oral dosing syringe or via nasogastric tube. The syringe method requires multiple administrations, often getsa smaller bolus, and can be particularly messy. In most cases, the nasogastric tube is the preferred route unless a very cranial abnormality issuspected. Radiography may be performed with thetube in situ to con rm tube location prior to contrast administration. Careful intubation is importantsince manipulation of the tube has been shown toinduce esophageal dilation. 6O n c et h et u b eh a ss u c - cessfully been positioned in the cranial esophagus, abolus of 350 to 500 mL of barium is administeredunder gravity. As the barium is being delivered, per-sonnel should position the x-ray machine and plateappropriately to acquire images in a timely manner. Image Acquisition Radiographs are obtained immediately following bar- ium administration. The decision on where to begin radiograph acquisition may depend in part on the sus- pected lesion location \u2014it is recommended to focus on this region initially to ensure that barium passage through this area is adequately demonstrated. If nospecic lesion location is suspected, begin caudally and move cranially. Radiographs may be repeatedevery 1 to 2 minutes until the contrast medium hasdisappeared completely. This usually occurs within a few minutes. 10Repeat boluses may be adminis- tered if required. In one study, two boluses of bar- ium suspension, each of 2.5 mL/kg, were administeredwithout associated signs of patient discomfort. 10 Fig. 1. Diagram illustrating the positioning of each radio- graphic eld of view (boxes) required to image the complete esophagus (depicted in red). Fig. 2. Aspiration of liquid barium in a foal. Radiodense bar- ium can be seen within the trachea (arrows) and throughout the bronchi (arrowheads). Cranial is to the left of the image.IMAGING 480 2021 / Vol. 67 / AAEP PROCEEDINGSFollow Up If an intraluminal obstruction is visualized via esophagram as failure of passage of the barium bolus, it is recommended to repeat the study following clear-ance of the obstruction to ensure that no underlying esophageal lesion such as a diverticulum or mass is present. It may also be desirable to perform thoracicradiographs in the few days following clearance of esophageal obstruction to look for evidence of aspira- tion pneumonia. This secondary complication hasbeen seen in up to 44% of horses presenting withesophageal obstruction. 2Thoracic radiographs may be particularly valuable in horses with a longer dura-tion of clinical signs since these cases have beens h o w nt ob em o r el i k e l yt od e v e l o pa s p i r a t i o npneumonia. 2,11Thoracic ultrasound should also be performed in suspect aspiration pneumonia cases. 3. Results At the authors 'institution, over a 10-year period (2010 -2020), 18 positive-contrast esophagrams were performed. For many of these ( bar- ium were administered nasoesophagealtube. For three studies, the patient consumed bar-ium-impregnated feed; in two cases, barium was administered per os via dosing syringe; in one case, barium administration was via both dosing syringeand nasoesophageal tube; and in one, both barium- coated feed and nasoesophageal intubation were utilized. Information regarding route of bariumadministration was not available for three cases.The normal passage of the esophagus is outlined in Figure 1. On precontrast survey radiographs, the normal esophagus is dif cult to discern since it does not con- tain air. Occasionally, a contrast bolus may persist within the normal esophagus until a second peristaltic wave completes passage into the stomach, particu- larly if a nasoesophageal tube is in place. Commonlocations for this temporary bolus retention are thethoracic inlet, just cranial to the cardiac silhouette, and at the cardia. In one study, disappearance of a barium bolus at the thoracic inlet by 2.5 minutes fol-lowing administration was seen in 80% of normalhorses, and bolus disappearance in the thoracic esoph- agus occurred in less than 2 minutes in 90% of horses. 10If material persists in these locations for multiple sequential radiographs and beyond these time limits, esophageal dysfunction may be suspected. In a normal esophagus, small volumes ofresidual contrast medium may be seen outlining thelongitudinal mucosal folds after the passage of the bolus (Fig. 3). 9Several studies, and a number of cases at the authors 'institution, demonstrated a roughly U-shaped conformation of the caudal cervical esophagus in some normal horses; therefore, this should not be overinterpreted as a diverticulum (Fig. 4).10,12The esophagus was deemed to beradiographically normal in six of the esophagrams performed within the study period. In two of the horses examined within the study pe- riod, generalized esophageal dilation was seen as awide, gas- lled viscus in the region of the esophagus on plain lms (Fig. 5) and as static contrast material within the dilated esophagus on sequential radio-graphs as part of the esophagram (Fig. 6). It is Fig. 3. Normal esophagus. Stranding of positive contrast ma- terial within the longitudinal mucosal folds of the esophagus(arrows). Cranial is to the left of the image. Fig. 4.

Cranial is to the left of the image.IMAGING AAEP PROCEEDINGS / Vol. 67 / 2021 481particularly important to perform concurrent or sub- sequent thoracic radiographs on cases of generalizedmegaesophagus since these horses are at higher risk of aspiration pneumonia (Fig. 7). 13 Peri-esophageal abscesses, tumors, or cysts may be appreciable as soft-tissue masses that might cause deviation of the esophagus and/or trachea. Figure 8 demonstrates a case of peri-esophageal abscess seen within the study period. Where esophageal perfora-tion is suspected, secondary to either chronic obstruc-tion with intraluminal necrosis or external trauma, gas and/or feed material may be seen within the peri- esophageal soft tissues. Intraluminal obstructionwith radio-opaque food material may appear as an ovoid heterogeneous mottled gas and soft-tissue opac- ity, often located at the thoracic inlet, heart base, orcardia. If the obstruction is well visualized on surveyradiographs, it may be prudent to forgo contrast administration due to the risk of re flux and aspiration of barium. No cases of either simple esophageal obstruction or perforation were seen within the study period at the authors 'institution, and food material was only seen within diverticula. Strictures resulting from intramural scarring secondary to previousobstruction or other esophageal trauma may be visual- ized as a smooth narrowing of the esophageal lumen with contrast retention oral to this region (Fig.9). 9This abnormality should be demonstrated to per- sist over radiographs so as to differentiate itfrom normal peristaltic contraction or esophagealspasm. 9Strictures were suspected radiographically in four horses in the study period. Finally, esophageal diverticula are visible as out- pouchings of the esophagus in which contrast materialwill usually ac-cumulate (Fig. 10). It can be dif cult to distinguish a true diverticulum from focal dila- tion radiographically. Diverticula may as herniation of mucosa occurs secondary to muscularis injury \u2014usually as a result of chronic impaction \u2014or traction, resulting from periesophageal scarring. literature that traction diverticula are sphericalwith a wide neck, whereas pulsion diverticula have a flask-like shape on esophagrams. 14In addition to contrast, food material and gas may be seen within the diverticula. Diverticula were detected radio-graphically in eight horses within the study period. Two horses within the study period were suspected of having a functional esophageal abnormality basedupon delayed passage of contrast medium. Severalhorses had multiple concurrent esophageal abnormal- ities, such as stricture with oral diverticulum (Fig. 9). In one esophagram performed during the study pe- riod, it was recommended to repeat the study due to ingestion of an inadequate volume of barium-coatedfeed. The only other reported complication associ- ated with esophagram radiography was a single Fig. pooling in caudal esophagus (arrows) over sequential radiographs obtained minutes apart.

In this case, barium administration vianasoesophageal tube was performed; however, thepresence of a congenital stricture likely resulted inreflux and aspiration of contrast material. The foal was treated for pre-existing aspiration pneumoniaand made a full recovery with apparent stricture resolution. 4. Discussion Contrast radiography can help to distinguish between generalized megaesophagus and focal esophageal dila- tations and their possible causes. Generalized mega- esophagus usually refl ects a functional abnormality ulceration, gastroesophageal congenitalesophageal neural de cits, and a hereditary condition associated with muscular hypertrophy of the distal esophagus in Friesian horses. Focal esophageal dila- tation and associated contrast accumulation may besecondary to either intra- or extraluminal obstruc-tions, including foreign masses,vascular ring or stricture, or may indicatediverticula. On consultation with radiologists at other referral hospitals, variations in preferred esophagram tech- nique are apparent. Two institutions utilize a 1:1 dilution of barium suspension (60 -105% w/v) with water administered via nasogastric tube. This infor-mation is valuable since it indicates that a smallerbarium dose can be used in a similar bolus volume tosuccessfully demonstrate esophageal abnormalities, thus reducing cost. Opinions regarding the success of barium-coated feed ingestion vary, with some indi-viduals citing a frequent failure to tempt the horse toeat and others advocating for barium-impregnatedmash as the primary technique utilized. At oneinstitution, the favored approach is to begin withingestion of a liquid slurry/mash and follow with increasingly dense barium-coated feed material to assess esophageal function with a variety ofmedia. Where the administration of barium-coatedfeed has been attempted within the authors ' Fig. 7. Aspiration pneumonia. Marked alveolar pattern within the ventral lung elds (arrows).

Fasting the horse prior to the study can also help encourage voluntary inges- tion of barium. If it is possible to tempt the horse toeat the barium product, this does have the advantages of,rst, avoiding the challenge of intubating a horse without sedation and, second, enabling visualization of bolus manipulation and swallowing in cases ofdysphagia. In these patients, it is particularly im- portant to assess for evidence of barium dorsal to the soft palate, or within the larynx or trachea, indicatingpharyngeal dysfunction. 9Abnormal esophagram ndings have been reported in cases of congenital anomalies such as cleft palate and postsurgically incases of laryngeal hemiplegia.12 No cases of simple obstruction were seen at the authors 'institution. This likely re flects the study population of a referral hospital, with most simpleobstructions resolved in the eld prior to or without need for referral. In cases that presented to the hos-pital with clinical suspicion of obstruction, these wereeither cleared before the esophagram was performedor identi ed as being secondary to diverticula on radiography. Soft-tissue masses, whether extraluminal or within the wall of the esophagus, may cause compression ordisplacement of the esophagus, which will be readily visible on contrast studies. Ultrasonographic evalua- tion of the cervical esophagus/thoracic inlet and addi-tional diagnostic procedures may be required to help differentiate abscesses, neoplasia, cysts, or other soft- tissue masses. Abscesses of the esophageal wall maybe associated with irregularity of the mucosal sur- face since these may originate from internal trauma. Esophagoscopy is a useful adjunct to esophageal ra- diography and can be used in combination withesophagrams to provide the most comprehensive clini- cal picture to facilitate accurate diagnosis, implementsuccessful treatment regimens, and assist with prognostication. Esophagoscopy provides important information regarding the gross appearance and in-tegrity of the esophageal mucosa, which may not beapparent radiographically. Management and treatment of esophageal disor- ders identi ed on esophagram vary depending on the specic lesion type. Medical management of eso- phageal obstructions is common, and these cases, ifisolated incidents without associated aspira-tion pneumonia, typically have a favorableoutcome. Recurrent obstruction is more likely to beassociated with an underlying morphological or func-tional abnormality, which may carry with it a poorerprognosis. Standing endoscopic balloon dilation ofesophageal strictures has been reported with a long-term survival rate of 56%. 15Options for surgical cor- rection of tractiondiverticulum, or patch grafting. 14Interventions for treatment of stricture should be delayed for 60 daysafter the original presentation since some studieshave demonstrated an increase in luminal diameterover this time period following the incitingincident. 16Traction diverticula infrequently produce clinical signs requiring medical pulsion diverticula may undergo progressive enlarge- ment, predisposing to recurrent obstruction andesophageal rupture, and may require surgicalrepair. Medical management is the only option forgeneralized megaesophagus due to congenital oracquired esophageal dysfunction. In conclusion, the esophagram is a valuable tool for diagnosis and characterization of functional and mor-phological esophageal abnormalities in horses andcan be readily performed with infrequent complica-tions by the well-prepared equine practitioner.

Acutt, BSc, BVSc DVM, DACVR* Deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) injuries, particularly core lesions, in the pastern are associated with additional tendinopathy within the hoof capsule. Further assessment of the extent of injury is indicated when pastern lesions are found. Authors 'address: Colorado State University, College of Veterinary Medicine, 300 West Drake Road, Fort Collins, CO 80523; e-mails: elizabeth.acutt@colostate.edu; myra.barrett@colostate.edu. *Corresponding author; Introduction Correct diagnosis of DDFT lesions allows targeted treatment and improved prognostication. This studyaims to assess the prevalence of, and characterize,DDFT lesions in the pastern with concurrent tendoninjury distally. It is hypothesized that tendinopathy,particularly core lesions, in the pastern will be associ-ated with distal lesions of the DDFT. 2. Materials and Methods Cases with DDFT lesions in the pastern with mag-netic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasound of thefoot were evaluated retrospectively. Lesion locationand type were recorded. Odds ratios were calculatedto determine associations between more distal tendin-opathy and the presence of different DDFT pasternlesion types.3. Results Thirty-four MRI scans of 33 horses and 64 ultrasoundexams of 58 horses were analyzed. Lesion locationand type were recorded. Distal DDFT lesions total cases of pastern DDF tendinop-athy and in 97% of cases with core lesions. A corelesion in the pastern was signi cantly more likely (OR = 20.7, 95% CI [2.2, 191.0], p = 0.008) to be associ-ated with injury in the foot than other types of pasternlesion. 4. Discussion Pathologic changes in the DDFT, particularly corelesions, are typically not an isolated nding. Further imaging is optimal to characterize the extent of ten-dinopathy to direct appropriate treatment andimprove prognostication.

Discussion The high interobserver agreement for PET, despitethe recent introduction of this technique, demon-strates the ease of clinical interpretation of PETscans. The higher number of lesions detected withPET compared with scintigraphy may be explained bythe cross-sectional nature and higher spatial resolu-tion of PET imaging.Acknowledgments This study was funded by the Dolly GreenResearch Foundation with support from theStronach Group, and by the Grayson Jockey ClubResearch Foundation.

Thickness and area of the LCAD were nega- tively correlated with resting laryngeal grade. 4. Discussion Results of ultrasonographic assessments of the CAD using transcutaneous ultrasonography were similar to those obtained by transesopha- geal ultrasonography. This technique enables a simple, non-invasive, direct, and easy ex-amination. Assessment of the CAD using trans-cutaneous ultrasonography may be a usefultechnique and a potential option for determiningwhether to perform nerve graft or laryngoplasty.Acknowledgments The Authors thank Dr. Norm G.

Authors ' addresses: Department of Surgery and Anaesthesiology of Domestic Animals, Ghent University, Salisburylaan 133, Merelbeke, Belgium (Haardt); Department of Veterinary Clinical and Diagnostic Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB T2N 4Z6, Canada (Romero, Introduction Abdominal ultrasonography is a valuable tool in diagno- sis of abnormalities causing colic. Shortened protocolssuch as FLASH enable practitioners with little experi-ence to perform an ultrasonographic examination in anemergency. However, most practitioners do not own anabdominal transducer to perform such an examination,while they commonly possess transrectal transducers forreproductive exams. The purpose of this study is tocompare identi cation of abnormalities using a transrec- tal and abdominal transducer for transcutaneous abdom-inal scans of horses presenting with colic. 2. Materials and Methods Twenty-four adult horses undergoing FLASH for investi-gation of colic were included in the study. The sameclinician performed the ultrasonographic examinationwith the transrectal transducer in all patients, whereas examination with the abdominal transducer was per- formed by another clinician. Using a Chi square,Fisher's exact, or Wilcoxon tests, the incidence of identi - cation of each abnormality was compared between bothtransducers. 3. Results and Discussion The transrectal transducer achieves comparable iden-tication rates with the abdominal transducer for all abnormalities found on FLASH presenting for colic,except those affecting the left kidney andstomach. Although not statistically signi cant, thickening of the colon wall was detected more fre-quently with the transrectal transducer.
