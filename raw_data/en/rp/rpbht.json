Common River is an unassuming name of an NGO that is based in Aleta Wondo, Ethiopia. However, its name is powerful in meaning and has many lessons embedded in it. Before Common River was established, co -founders Tsegaye Bekele and Donna Sillan conducted a feasibility study in 2007 to inform w hat would become the vision and mission for their NGO . During the study, they met with numerous community members and officials, including a regional parliamentary member who had known Tsegaye's family when they were younger. When asked why he seemed to kn ow Tsegaye so well despite not having been familiar with each other in years, he responded: \"We come from the same river.\" Tsegaye, Donna, and their staff embraced the Common River name as a reminder of the shared connections and responsibility we have f or each other, our communities, and our world. But it also reflects their view of community development. In their own words, \"development is a process. It is a moving stream which flows according to changing circumstances.\" In designing Common River's pro grams and activities, Tsegaye and Donna believed it was important for the community to identify and own programs that would meet their needs. Rather than impose programs, they instead facilitated processes for the Aleta Wondo community to define their need s and priorities. And through this process, enable community members to build self-reliance and empowerment. The Common River model that Tsegaye and Donna have built has lessons to teach us all. We first learned about their work in 2012 after reading Sidama Sustenance , a book by Donna about the foodways, culture, and traditions of the Sidama tribe. The book also described Common River's positive deviance approach to development, which closely aligned with our global health mission. Since 2007, faculty, staff and students from the University of Wisconsin - Madison (UW) have engaged in health -related educational and research partnerships in Ethiopia , primarily with medical schools (Addis Ababa University and Hawassa 4Unive rsity). In 2012, the UW began to explore opportunities to build community -based partnerships to strengthen health systems in communities, rather than only focus on Ethiopian hospitals and academic institutions . We learned about Common River at this time and contacted Tsegaye and Donna because we knew UW students and staff could learn from their experience and leadership. In June 2013, Common River hosted its first group from the UW ( 9 students and staff ) for a global health field course . The UW students completed a service learning project on the distribution, abundance, and diversity of plants used for medicine at Common River. Our intent was for UW students to engage in a community service project to produce knowledge for the benefit o f the community, and to understand the importance of involving community members throughout the process. We wanted to learn from and apply Common River's approach of engaging the community from project concept to implementation, and finally to evaluating and celebrating re sults . The end result of this process is this handbook, which is a compilation of the field research collected in June 2013. But this handbook is not the only result of the project. An equally or perhaps more important outcome was the exchange of ideas, information and relationships that were built. We may indeed come from the same river, but as Heraclitus wrote \"you cannot step into the same river twice,\" for as we step into the river we change it and likewise we are changed by it. We hope this handbook will be a valuable resource to the Common River community, now and for future generations. But also that this flow of engagement will continue between Common River and the UW. Heidi Busse, MPH and Girma Tefera, MD July 2013 I. BACKGROUND 2 3 3 This project was made possible by the time and effort generously provided by numerous contributors. Special recognition is due to Tsegaye Bekele and Donna Sillan for their vision, leadership, and hospitality as hosts at their non -profit Common River. The p roject was conceived of and facilitated by University of Wisconsin -Madison staff Heidi Busse and Dr. Girma Tefera, and executed by Alex McAlvay (PhD student) , Yuli Chen (Undergraduate Student ), and students from the 2013 Ethiopia F ield Course . Thanks to E phrem Abebe Aboneh (Instructor from Addis Ababa University and PhD candidate at the UW-Madison School of Pharmacy ) and Biniam Melese ( Haw assa University medical student) for sharing their valuable medicinal and cultural knowledge. The patience and openness of those who shared their knowledge made this project possible. Werknesh, who was not only an excellent trilingual translator, but also a repository of herbal knowledge contributed sig nificantly as Mitiku, Berikat, Derribe and Abraham, who know so much and freely shared their knowledge about plants. We extend our additional thanks and appreciation to the students on the 2013 Ethiopia Field Course, Abby Kohlenberg, Lennea Rylander, Hanna Vadebonc oeur, Liz Wendt, and Tara , for their contributions to the field work . This handbook and the field work received financial support from the University of Wisconsin - Madison School of Medicine & Public Health, the Division of Vascula r Surgery, and the UW-College of Agriculture & Life Sciences -International Programs.

A CKNOWLEDGEMENT S Hanna, Alex, Liz, Selam, Abby, Heidi, Lennea Burake, Ashenafi, Yuli, Jamal, and Ayallo 4 5 The World Health Organization (WHO) defines traditional medicine as \"health practices, approaches, knowledge and beliefs incorporating plant, animal and mineral based medicines, spiritual therapies, manual techniques and exercises, applied singularly or in combination to treat, diagnose and prevent illness and maintain well - being\" (1). In many developing countries in Asia, Latin America, and Africa (including Ethiopia), it serves to meet the primary health care needs of the people (2). In Ethiopia, tradit ional medicine plays an important role in the health care system. I t is estima ted that more than 80% of the population relies up on traditional medicine due to 1) cultural acceptance 2) relatively low cost and 3) lack of access of modern health facilities ( 3, 4). The vast majority of Ethiopia's population lives in rural areas where access to health services is challenging. Moreover, existing health sector resources (health workers, resources, and medicines) are limited . The greatest challenge is to determi ne how best to narrow the gap between the limited services and the population who needs them (5). In 2003/2004, it was found that at least 30% of the population did not have access to formal health services. A major contributing factor of this problem is the severe shortage of doctors and healthcare professionals. The national average physician to population ratio was 1:51042, with over 35% of the physicians found in three major cities, serving 4.7% of the total population (6). In recent years, it has bee n recognized that traditional medicine plays an important role in health system s. Recognizing its importance, governments of many developing countries have made initiatives towards programs to promote safe and effective traditional medicine practices in the health care sector (7). The Sidama p eople of the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region (SNNPR) have relied on plants to treat illnesses and diseases for generations . Spiritual practices play a large part in the healing process and ha ve been integrated with the knowledge of medicinal plants (8). This indigenous knowledge has been passed down through generations, but is facing the threat of being lost due to cultural change and declining resources for natural medicinal products (9). The preservation of traditional practice s is not only important in ensuring the continued access to medicine, but also for the preservation of the Sidama culture. In addition, the preservation of traditional medicines is vital in reducing the loss of biodiversity and promoting environmental health (9). In efforts to pre serve medicinal plant knowledge, in recent years numerous Ethiop ian plants have been validated in a scientific empirical framework through phytochemical ana lysis and subsequent bioassays. This work, largely being undergone at Addis Ababa University and the Ethiopian Health a nd Nutrition Research Institute, has led to the formulation and distribution of a number of standardized phytopharmaceuticals. This work is one example of ways western medicine can collaborate with indigenous peoples to build common knowledge about plants and their traditional medicinal uses. And, subsequently, may help narrow the gap between limited health resources and the rural indigeno us peoples who need improved services. Common River, a non -profit organization in Aleta Wondo, has recognized the importance of preserving medicinal plant knowledge and the multiple benefits. Students and staff from UW-Madison worked with Common River in 2013 on a service learning project to preserve indigenous knowledge of Sidama medicinal plants. This handbook is the result of that collaboration to document knowledge held among the Sidama in Aleta Wondo. Our shared aim is to preserve indigenous knowl edge of Sidama medicinal plants for current and future generations. This handbo ok serves not only that purpose, but also a record of the friendship between the UW -Madison and Common River. III. INTRODUCTION 6 7 7 IV. COMMON RIVER OVERVIEW Common River is a 501(c)3, California -based nonprofit organization, working to provide sustainable community development in Aleta Wondo, located in the Sidama zone of the SNNPR, Ethiopia. In 2007, Donna Sillan and Tsegaye Bekele started this organization based on the model of Positive Deviance (PD) . PD is an asset -based community development model that uses the strengths and assets a community already has to create and motivate change. Common River's mission is to empower the community to become balanced, productive, and self -susta ining for others to witness and replicate, while honoring cultural heritage and biodiversity. They work to help develop the community through education, health, enterprise and infrastructure. Common River works to preserve the Sidama culture and way of life. By growing native crops, cooking local foods and celebrating the heritage of the region, Common River works within the community rather than trying to change it. Using the natural resources, hands and minds of the community; Common River takes possibility and makes it reality for those in Aleta Wondo. 8 9 V.a How to Use This Handbook This handbook is meant to serve as a repository of cultural knowledge, and not a manual for botanical medical practice. These plants should only be used under the a dvisement of knowledgeable practitioner of traditional medicine. A number of plants have poisonous look -alikes. Others are toxic when used improperly or in excess dosage and certain plant medicines have dangerous interactions with pharmaceuticals. 'Plants and their uses' are listed alphabetically by their Latin name (Section V.c.). For each plant, the Amharic and Sidama translation, medicinal use, preparations and administration, adverse effects, and pharmacological properties are listed. Additiona lly, plants can be identified by medicinal use and listed by botanical names (Appendix Section VI). V. HANDBOOK 10 11 V.b Sidama Concepts of Disease The diseases recognized by the Sidama include both conditions acknowledged by scientific medicine and unique to their culture. Some of these illnesses are known to other Ethiopian people while others only to the Sidama. The conditions that are most common and most grave appear to have proportionately more plant cur es than those that are minor or rare. For example, the preponderance of stomach illness encountered by the Sidama is reflected in the many herbs used for \"stomach ache,\" a term describing a variety of gastrointestinal diseases. Causative factors of dis ease may also diverge from scientific medical thought such as buda or evil eye and being circled by bats (Yelelito Wof ). The diseases mentioned in this handbook can be found below. Balaamo : A condition where painful swellings or pustules arise on the sk in. Herbs are often spit on the sores, while the words \"burst\" or \"spread out\" are uttered. Dingatenia : Stomach ailment resulting from going out into the cold. M'utch : This disease results from an unclean, greasy, or sweaty part of the body being exp osed to the sun. Symptoms include rash and irritation. Scientific medicine has identified it as herpes labialis aggravated by heat. Yelelito Wof : This illness occurs when a bat circles the head of the afflicted and/or defecates on them. The symptoms i nclude yellowing of the eyes. Scientific medicine identifies this as Hepatitis. 12 13 V.c Sidama Plants and Their Part(s) used: cloves Preparation & Administration: Common cold: cloves ground up and mixed with honey, take first thing in morning on an empty stomach Malaria: peeled and infused in clarified butter and eaten Pharmacological properties Allicins: fibrinolytic activity which reduces platelet aggregation by inhibiting prostaglandin E2 (11). 16 any): Part(s) used: leaves Preparation: spikes removed, ground with some water to make pulp Administration: Cancer & laxative: mix 1 tablespoon of pulp with honey, eaten 2 times a day Wound healing: apply liquid from pulp to wound Dandruff: message pulp into scalp, sit under sun for 30 min, wash hair Pharmacological properties Bradykinase: anti-inflammation when applied to skin Administration: Smallpox: ground leaves and apply topically Stomach ache: wrap leaves in enset leaves and put over fire, squeeze liquid out of bundle, drink on empty stomach Infant growth: decoction of leaves given to infants under six months who are too small Pharmacological properties Essential Oils (-thujone) have antispasmodic, antifungal, (if any): Part(s) used: fruit (peppers) Preparation: used eaten Pharmacological properties Capsaicin -relief of neuropathic pain, protect gastric against ulceration (low dosage), weight loss (1 5) Preparation & Administration: Amoebic dysentery: chew 7 seeds three times a day Abortion: maceration of young leaves in cold water Pharmacological properties Quercetin and -sitosterol Amharic: Lomi Sidama: any): Part(s) used: fruit Preparation & Administration: Drink fruit juice vomiting Pharmacological properties stimulant and protector (1 7) Citrus medica (citron) Amharic: Tiringo Sidama: Turungo (if any): Part(s) used: fruit Preparation & Administration: Fruit eaten for high blood pressure Pharmacological properties Essential oils (limonene): aromatic and tonic Effects (if any): Part(s) used: coffee bean; leaves Preparation & Administration Cease wound bleeding: apply coffee grounds to wounds Stomach ache: drink tea made of coffee leaves mixed with chili and fennel Pharmacological properties Polyphenols and flavonoids - any): Part(s) used: branch Preparation & Administration: branch chewed first thing in morning to induce vomiting, which aids upset stomach Pharmacological properties N/A any): Part(s) used: sap Preparation & Administration: leaf stem broken and sap applied topically to skin (sap dries black) Pharmacological properties a potent malaria vector (20), anticonvulsant and effects (2 0). 26 any): Part(s) used: leaves Preparation & Administration: leaves crushed, juice given to animals for diarrhea Pharmacological properties -pinene, Effects (if any): Part(s) used: leaves Preparation & Administration: leaves rubbed vigorously on skin for fundal conditions Pharmacological properties Phenolic and flavonoid compounds (Hydro -Q Part(s) used: stem; leaves Preparation & Administration: stem juice applied to wounds to stop bleeding; insert leaf into nose to stop nose bleed Pharmacological used: rhizome Preparation & ache Pharmacological properties Morelloflavone Effects (if any): Part(s) used: leaves Preparation & Administration: cold water Part(s) used: seeds Preparation & Administration Seed s dried, powered and eaten to eliminate hookworms Pharmacological properties Embelinone, Aegicerin, protoprimulagenin A inducing abortion; wound healing; strength and improve immune health Adverse Effects (if any): Part(s) used: root Preparation & Administration Specific varieties eaten for bone fractures, aiding placental discharge after birth, diarrhea, inducing abortion and wound heali ng Bulla (made from liquid squeezed from processing) drink as tonic for strength and improved immune function coughing; stomach problems Adverse Effects (if any): Part(s) used: stem Preparation & Administration: Stimulate milk flow (cows) & treat cough: cold water maceration of stem Stoma ch problems: chew Pharmacological properties used: fruit; leaves Preparation & Administration: Stomach ache: chew top part of fruit Fever: rub leaves on skin to reduce fever Common cold: boil Eucalyptus and Damakasse in water and inhaled extracts Part(s) used: leaves Preparation & Administration: Diuretic: added (if any): commonly overdosed Part(s) used: female flowers Preparation & Administration: infusion of the female flowers Pharmacological properties quercetin 3 (if any): Part(s) used: flowers Preparation & Administration: mix 7 flowers of Yellow Aster with young leaves of gesho chewed in a quid wrapped with cloth or enset leaves.
