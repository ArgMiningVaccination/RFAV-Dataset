None of them is a cure forMS. However ,all of them haven proven records of some success in slowing disease progression and accumulation of disability. TREATMENT OPTIONS Rebif, Copaxone, Betaseron, and Avonex are self-injectable drugs for long-term use; they modulate the immune system. Novantrone is an immune system suppressor,delivered by IV infusion in a medical setting; Tysabri is an immunomodulator thatis administered monthly by IV infusion. 80Disease-Modifying Medications for MS: Indications Brand Name Indications (taken from FDA-approved labeling) Immunomodulating Drugs Avonex\u00ae For tr eatment of r elapsing forms of MS, and for a single clinical episode if MRI featur es consistent with MS ar ealso pr esent Betaser on\u00ae For tr eatment of r elapsing for ms of MS and secondary- progressive MS with relapses Copaxone\u00ae For tr eatment of r elapsing-r emitting MS Rebif\u00ae For treatment of relapsing forms of MS Tysabri\u00ae For treatment of relapsing forms of MS as a monotherapy (i.e., not used in combination with any other immunomodulatingtherapy); generally recommended for patients who have hadinadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, alternative MS therapies such as those listed above Immunosuppressant Drug Novantrone\u00ae For treatment of worsening relapsing-remitting MS and for progressive-relapsing or secondary-progressive MSDisease-Modifying Medications for MS Manufacturer/Distributor Brand Name Generic Name and Year of FDA Approval Immunomodulating Drugs Avonex\u00ae Interferon beta-1a Biogen Idec, Immunosuppressant Drug Novantrone\u00ae Mitoxantrone; as of 2006, Serono, Inc., 2000 available as a generic drug81Disease-Modifying Medications for MS: Dosage Brand Name Frequency, Route of Delivery, and Usual Dose Immunomodulating Drugs Avonex\u00ae Once a subcutaneous injection; 44 mcg Tysabri\u00ae Every four weeks by IV infusion in a registered infusion facility; 300 mg Immunosuppressant Drug Novantrone\u00ae Four times a year by IV infusion in a medical facility; lifetime limit of 8-12 doses (12 mg/m2every 3 months) DRUG SIDE EFFECTS AND WARNINGS Managing Side Effects of the Self-Injectable Drugs The flu-like side effects of the interferon products\u2014Avonex\u00ae,Betaseron\u00ae,and Rebif\u00ae\u2014 can usually be minimized. Strategies can be discussed with the physician, or with thepatient support program of the drug company, which is available through a toll-freenumber (see Industr y-Sponsored Sites table below). Should unacceptable side effects occur ,clients can explor ethe possible change to another dr ug with their healthcare professional. The dr ugs that ar einjected subcutaneously, including Copaxone \u00ae,Rebif\u00ae,and Betaser on\u00ae may cause injection site reactions, including bumps, bruises, pain, and infections. Good injection techniques can minimize pr oblems. Auto-injecting devices may be helpful. The drug company patient support programs offer injection training and helpful tips for avoiding or limiting site reactions.82Disease-Modifying Medications for MS: Common Side Effects* Brand Name Side Effects Immunomodulating Drugs Avonex\u00ae Flu-like symptoms following injection, which generally lessen over time. (See Managing Side Effects for more information.)Less common: depression, mild anemia, elevated liverenzymes, allergic reactions, heart problems. Betaseron\u00ae Flu-like symptoms following injection, which lessen over time for many. (See Managing Side Effects for more information.)Injection site reactions, about 5% of which need medical atten-tion. Less common: allergic reactions, depression, elevated liverenzymes, low white blood cell counts. Copaxone\u00ae Injection site reactions. Less common: vasodilation (dilation of blood vessels); chest pain; a reaction after injection,which includes anxiety, chest pain, palpitations, shortness ofbreath, and fl ushing (this lasts 15-30 minutes, passes without treatment, and has no known long-term effects). Rebif\u00ae Flu-like symptoms following injection, which lessen over time for many. (See Managing Side Effects for more information.)Injection site reactions. Less common: Liver abnormalities,depression, aller gic reactions, and low red or white blood cell counts. Tysabri\u00ae Headache, fatigue, urinar ytract infections, depr ession, lower respirator infections, joint and chest discomfor t. Less common: allergic or hypersensitivity reactions within 2 hours of infusion (dizziness, fever, rash, itching, nausea,flushing, low blood pressure, difculty breathing, chest pain).(See Tysabri \u00aeWarnings on the next page.) Immunosuppressant Drug Novantrone\u00ae Blue-green urine 24 hours after administration; infections, bone marrow suppression (fatigue, bruising, low blood cell counts),nausea, hair thinning, bladder infections, mouth sores. Patientsmust be monitored for serious liver and heart damage. (SeeNovantrone \u00aeWarnings on the next page.) *Always inform the supervising healthcare professional of side effects. See the text for additional information.Novantrone\u00aeWarnings Novantrone\u00ae(mitoxantrone) is a chemotherapeutic drug, originally developed to treat certain forms of cancer. The total lifetime dose is limited in order to avoid possible heartdamage. People taking Novantrone \u00aeshould have tests of their heart function before each dose. It cannot be used in people with pre-existing heart problems, liver disease, andcertain blood disorders. Tysabri\u00aeWarnings Tysabri\u00aeslows or stops T cells from moving out of the bloodstream and into the brain and spinal cord where they may orchestrate the inflammation that is believed to resultin MS attacks. It is important that clients consider the following information in discussions with their healthcare professional about starting treatment with Tysabri \u00ae.Three people who had been in clinical trials involving Tysabri\u00aedeveloped a rare brain disease called PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy), caused by a common virus called the JC virus. Two of these 3 people died. There is not enough known about the true risk ofgetting PML in people who may use Tysabri \u00ae.For this reason, Tysabri\u00aeis only available under a restricted distribution program referred to as the TOUCH program. Prescribingphysicians and patients must enroll in this mandatory registry program. Patients usingTysabri \u00aeshould promptly report any continuously worsening symptoms that persist over several days to their pr escriber . Tysabri\u00aeshould not be used by persons whose immune systems are weakened by disease or by the use of dr ugs that alter the immune system, including other disease-modifying MS therapies. Currently, nothing is known about the safety of long-term use of Tysabri\u00ae\u2014or whether additional side ef fects will emer ge in time. All drugs delivered by IV infusion pose risks of bruising, vein damage, blood clots and more. Infusions must be managed by a well-trained medical pr ofessional. PAYING FOR A DISEASE-MODIFYING DRUG The annual expense of these drugs is signicant. Some private insurance plans do not cover prescription drugs, although they may cover procedures such as IV infusions in amedical facility. Plans that do cover prescription drugs often have a list of specic drugscovered by the plan known as a formulary. It is possible that some disease-modifyingdrugs are covered by a plan and some are not. Insurance information about Tysabri \u00aeis not yet fully available. The following table provides contact information for the patientassistance pr ograms of the pharmaceuitical companies that can provide consumers with reimbursement information and potential avenues to receive nancial assistance withthe cost of their drug. 83Because Novantr one\u00aeand T ysabri\u00aemust be infused in a medical facility ,they are covered under Medicare Part B. If Avonex\u00aeis administered in a physician's ofce or clinic, it will be covered by Medicare Part B. Medicare Part D covers prescription drugs through private plans approved by Medicare. For more information on Medicare prescription drug coverage, go to: www.nationalmssociety.org/medicare_basics.asp, or call your chapter at 1-800-FIGHT-MS (1-800-344-4867)for more information. Medicaid includes prescription drug coverage. However, the list of specic drugs covered may vary from state to state. Contact must be made with a state's Medicaid ofce fordetails. 84Industry-Sponsored Sites for Patient Information and/or Financial Assistance Brand Name Telephone World Wide Web Immunomodulating Drugs Care The following is a detailed description of catheter care. This care requires a licensed nurse, or other properly trained person. The mainstay of treating an atonic bladder or detrusor (bladder muscle)/sphincter dyssynergia with elevated residual urine is intermittent clean catheterization. If anindividual with one of these bladder pr oblems or with frequent incontinence cannot perform clean intermittent catheterization because of insufcient manual dexterity,an indwelling intra-ur ethral or suprapubic Should an indwelling catheter be necessar y,asuprapubic tube should be consider ed. Thereis some evidence that ther earefewer infections with the latter .Many women with MS who r equire indwelling catheters are still menstruating or are incontinent of bowel which gives dir ect route of bacteria along the outside of the catheter into the bladder .The presence of recurrent urethritis or epididymitis and in severe instances, scrotal abscess in the male favors the use of a suprapubic catheter. CARE OF THE INDWELLING CATHETER Routine care includes daily cleaning of the catheter and the urethral meatus which is where the catheter exits the body. There should be additional cleaningafter bowel movements to prevent infection. Anti-microbial ointment at the catheter as it enters the meatus is not recom- mended, as this has not been shown to reduce infections. After r outine cleaning care, secure catheter to leg with catheter strap or tape. This prevents the catheter from tugging, it prevents erosion of the urethra andit prevents the catheter from being pulled out. Keep the urine bag below the level of the bladder to prevent urine from flowing back into the bladder which can cause infection. Assessing Bladder Drainage If the level of urine in the bag has stopped rising (no urine has drained from the catheter in 6-8 hours): Check that the tubing is not twisted or kinked.Check that nothing is lying on the catheter.Check that the urine bag is below the level of the bladder.Check that clothing and/or bedding are not wet with urine.Check that pain or distention is not presentIf urine is leaking and wetting clothing/bed clothes, or if pain or lower abdominal distress is present, the catheter might need gentle irrigation (see below). Draining the Leg Bag The drainage bag should be emptied at least every 8 hours or when the bag is 2/3full. The draining spout and the non-sterile collecting container should not come into contact. Obtain urine specimens by sterile technique.After the bag is empty ,clean the tip with betadine solution and then close the valve. Replace the drain spout into the sleeve on the bag. Disconnecting the Leg Bag Do not disconnect the urine bag except to clean and put on a new bag. Before going to bed, change the leg bag used during the day to a larger night drainage bag. Make sure to empty the leg bag rst before disconnecting.After the bag is empty, clamp the catheter by pinching the tubing.Clean the connection between catheter and tubing with betadine swab.Disconnect the catheter from the leg bag tubing and connect the night draining tubing to the catheter ,then release the tubing. 86Cleaning the Drainage Bag Unhook the old bag to be cleaned, and attach the Foley catheter to another drainage bag. Wash the old bag with soap and warm water, and then rinse the bag with warm water. Fill the bag with one part of white vinegar to three parts tap water. Let thebag sit with the water/vinegar mixture for 30 minutes. Empty the bag; rinse gentlywith water, and let air dry. There is little consensus as to how long to use a drainage bag. Recommendations vary from one week to one month. The drainage bag should be washed every day. Changing the Catheter There is no uniform agreement on how often to change the catheter; once a month is usually recommended. For individuals not having any problem with the catheter,once every six weeks may be sufcient. With obstruction or infection it may benecessary to change the catheter as often as every one to three weeks. If thecatheter is clogged, appears to be pr oducing pain, or there is infection, then it may require immediate replacement. The most narrow, softest tube that will serve the purpose should be used. The usual size is Fr ench 14-16 with a 5 cc balloon infl ated with 10 cc of water . Fluid Intake The individual should drink enough fluid so that the urine is clear and pale yellow in color ,at least 1.5-2 quar ts of fl uid a day. Carbonated drinks should be avoided as they make the urine alkaline, encouraging stone formation and bacterial growth. Bacterial growth may be deterred by acidic urine. Some have found it helpful to take cranberry extract in gel capsules to acidify the urine and keep bacteria fromadhering to the bladder wall and thus causing infection. Cranberry extract gelcapsules can be opened and the contents added to applesauce or other foodstuff.Aclient's physician should be advised if cranberry extract is being taken. Caffeine-containing beverages may irritate the bladder, increasing urgency and/or spasm. 87INFECTION AND OTHER COMPLICATIONS There are always bacteria in the urine of someone with an indwelling catheter; this is not necessarily a true infection. Continuous use of antibiotics to prevent growth of asympto-matic bacteria in urine is rarely indicated and improper antibiotic use will lead to thegrowth of resistant bacteria which will be more difcult to treat and will eventuallyrequire more powerful antibiotics. Signs of Urinary Tract Infection in an Individual With an Indwelling Urethral or Suprapubic Foley Catheter Fever: Fever greater than 101 degrees Fahrenheit may signify a kidney infection that requires immediate attention. A healthcare provider should be informed in case ofany fever, however. Nausea and vomiting (This usually occurs with infection of the kidney) Cloudy Urine: If the urine becomes cloudy ,blood tinged, shows a change with increased sediment and/or mucus, and/or has a foul smell, an infection may bepresent, but antibiotics may not be indicated. Start with increasing fluids for 24hours and then if ther eis no impr ovement, antibiotics may be needed; infor ma healthcare provider (nurse or physician) in any case. Colonization: An incr ease in the number of white blood cells in the urine (pyuria) is often a better indication of infection than is a culture which may reveal asympto-matic bacteria in the urine (colonization) or a signicant infection. Use of urinaly-sis as well as culture and sensitivity are complimentary. The nature of the organismisalso important in the decision of whether or not to treat (common contaminant versus serious pathogen). Sudden increase in physical weakness or fatigueDecreased mental acuityHypotensionMore frequent blockage of the catheterIncreased bladder spasmsLower abdominal pain and/or distentionIncreased spasticity 88Treating Infection Make sure the catheter is draining well. Increase fluid intake, get urinalysis and urine culture and sensitivity as both may be necessary for subsequent selection of an appropriate antibiotic. The catheter should be changed when symptomatic urinary tract infection occurs and a urine specimen for culture and sensitivity and urinalysis should be takenonce the new catheter is in place. Wash hands with soap and water before and after a urine specimen is obtained. Most catheter-associated urinary tract infections that are asymptomatic are generally considered to be benign. These asymptomatic infections, with the exception of thatassociated with pyuria of signicance, may not need treatment. Occasionally, especiallywhen symptomatic, infection must be considered signicant if symptoms persist morethan a day. Such infection might lead to complications such as prostatitis, epididymitis,cysitis, pyelonephritis (or infection of the kidney), and bacteremia (sepsis) especially inhigh-risk individuals. Sepsis has a significant mortality; it occurs in less than 1% ofcatheterized individuals. The natural history of catheter-associated urinary tract infectionis lar gely unstudied. What to Do If Bladder Spasms Occur Spasms often pr esent as leakage ar ound the catheter . mg four times a day), tolter odine (Detrol 2 mg two times a day), or solifenacine succinate (Vesicare 5 mg once daily). Catheter Irrigation Catheter irrigation on a routine basis generally should be avoided. Irrigation once every two weeks or with a frequency as recommended by a physician might be ofbene tif obstr uction or plugging of the catheter is a r ecurring problem. Some physicians r ecommend sterile solution ir rigants used with a lar ge volume sterile syringe. Others r ecommend an acidic irrigation solution which might decrease the risk of infection as well decrease the clogging of the catheter. A0.25% sterile acidic acetic acid solution is r ecommended by some physicians for bladder irrigation. The solution should not be kept for more than two weeks andshould be refrigerated after it is made. The solution should be returned to roomtemperatur ebefore using. 89APPENDIXC Braden Scale for Predicting Pressure Ulcer Risk There are two versions of the Braden Scale, one for use in the hospital or nursing home setting, and one for use in home care. The latter is shown on the next twopages. Assessment with the home car eversion is recommended at the rst visit and weekly for several weeks, then monthly if condition does not change. A videotapethat teaches the use of the Scale is available for rent or purchase.

TOTAL SCORE:Patient's Name (page 2 of 2) MOBILITY: Ability to Change and Control Body PositionAPPENDIXD Intrathecal Baclofen Therapy for MS Intrathecal baclofen therapy is an intervention used by many people with multiple sclerosis to address severe spasticity. What is baclofen? Baclofen is a muscle relaxant medicine commonly used to decrease spasticity related to multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injuries, or other neurological diseases. Spasticity isamotor disorder characterized by tight or stiff muscles that might interfere with voluntary muscle movements. How does baclofen work? Spasticity is caused by an imbalance of excitator yand inhibitory input in the spinal cord. This imbalance causes hyperactive muscle stretch reflexes. These reflexes resultin involuntar yspasms and incr eased muscle tone. Baclofen estoring the balance of excitator yand inhibitor yinput to reduce muscle hyperactivity. In this way, it allows more normal motor movements. How does Intrathecal Baclofen Therapy (ITB) work? Intrathecal Baclofen Therapy is a an injectable form of baclofen, Lioresal Intrathecal (baclofen injection), directly to the fluid surrounding the spinal cor dby using a pr ogrammable pump and catheter that ar esurgically placed in the body .This method of drug delivery is called intrathecal infusion. The drug infusion system delivers the medication in small, precisely controlled doses. What makes ITB therapy dif ferent fr omoral medications is the deliver yof the drug baclofen to the fluid-lled area surrounding the spinal cord, called the intrathecal space. Unlike oralmedications, which circulate throughout the body in the blood, the drug is deliveredwher eit is used. This may help minimize potential systemic side ef fects.What are the side effects? Oral and intrathecal baclofen can cause potential side effects. Some side effects of baclofen include dizziness, drowsiness, headaches, nausea, and weakness. Why might intrathecal baclofen be preferred over oral baclofen? Baclofen can be taken orally or delivered into the intrathecal space. The intrathecal space contains the cerebrospinal fluid, the fluid surrounding the spinal cord and nerve roots.Oral baclofen causes side effects that might limit its usefulness. Of the oral baclofen delivered throughout the body, only a small portion goes to the spinal fluid where it is needed to work. An intrathecal delivery system, which providesthe baclofen right to the target site in the spinal cord, is an effective way to deliver themedicine. What is the baclofen pump system? The baclofen pump system is the intrathecal (directly into the spinal fluid) method of delivering the medicine. The system consists of a catheter (a small, flexible tube) and apump. The pump\u2014a round metal disc, about one inch thick and three inches indiameter\u2014is surgically placed under the skin of the abdomen near the waistline. The pump stores and releases prescribed amounts of medicine through the catheter. The pump is relled by inserting a needle through the skin into a lling port in the center ofthe pump. With a programmable pump, a tiny motor moves the medicine from the pumpreservoir through the catheter. Using an external programmer, the treatment team can make adjustments in the dose, rate, and timing of the medicine. Patients must r eturnto their doctor' sofce for pump rells and medicine adjustments, typically ever ytwo to thr ee months. The pump is taken out and r eplaced at the end of the batter y's life span, which is usually ve to seven years. Who is a candidate for the pump system? Anyone who has spasticity and is not responsive to oral medicine can be considered for the baclofen pump system. What are the advantages of the baclofen pump system? It efciently reduces spasticity and involuntary spasms, promoting a more active lifestyle, better sleep, and reduced need for oral medicines. It continuously delivers baclofen in small doses directly to the spinal fluid, increasing the therapeutic bene ts, and causing fewer and less sever eside effects compared to the oral medicine. Itcan be individually adjusted to allow infusion rates that vary over a 24-hour period. It can be tur ned of fif spasticity r eduction has shown no bene t. Pain and discomfor tfrom spasms and spasticity are often reduced or eliminated. 96What is involved in the initial evaluation for baclofen therapy? If a person with MS is considering intrathecal baclofen therapy, he/she will likely have an initial evaluation by a treatment team that might include a doctor who specializes inrehabilitation (physiatrist), a physical therapist, an occupational therapist, a nurse, andasocial worker. All of these professionals work as a team to provide a comprehensive evaluation of spasticity symptoms and establish a treatment plan adapted to a patient'spersonal needs. How will a doctor know if the baclofen pump system will work? If the treatment team recommends the baclofen pump system after an evaluation, the patient will have a trial of the intraspinal therapy to test the potential effectiveness ofthe medicine. During the medicine trial, baclofen is injected into the spinal canal (using a small needle) and the patient is assessed by the treatment team over two to four hours to determinehow well the medicine treats the spasticity. If muscles don't relax during the rst trial, alarger dose might be given on a later date to determine its effectiveness. Patients whoexperience positive results with the intrathecal medicine can decide with their doctor andfamily members if they should have a baclofen pump system implanted. What happens after the surgical procedure? After the implantation procedure, the patient stays in the hospital a few days so recovery can be closely monitor ed. While in the hospital, the dose of baclofen is adjusted. Follow- up visits with the doctor ar escheduled. How does one know when the battery in the pump is about to run out? The pump is equipped with an alar mthat beeps when the batter yis near depletion. The alarmis a soft, high-pitched beep. The beeps may occur several times a minute. The alarm is designed to alert the patient and doctor that the pump should be checked. The doctor can program an alarm \"test\" during an office visit so that the patient can hear what the alarm sounds like. The pump alarm is a relatively soft beep; as a result,some people have trouble hearing it when the pump is implanted. Because the patientmay not be able to hear the soft alarm, the doctor should be contacted if the patientexperiences a change in his/her condition. If the low-battery alarm is sounding, how long will it be before the battery is fully depleted? Many people are surprised at how soft the alarm is and may not hear it when it initially starts. Other times, the person does not hear it at all. For this reason, it is recommended that the patient schedule a pump replacement as soon as a low-battery alarm is conrmedby the doctor. If this is not possible, the doctor may prescribe oral medications as aprecaution. The oral medication may supplement other medical treatment and is meant to help prevent withdrawal symptoms in the event that the pump stops working beforeit is replaced. 97Does the alarm always indicate a battery nearing depletion? No. The pump alarm may indicate that the pump needs refilling or that there is a pump memory error (see below). If the pump needs refilling, a \"low-reservoir\" alarmwill sound. The alarm also may temporarily sound if the drug was not warmed to bodytemperature before the pump was filled. This alarm is a single beep. If the alarmsounds for more than a few minutes, the patient should call the doctor to identifyand correct the situation. During the clinic visit, the doctor will check the pump andmanage any problems. Is there an alarm to indicate that there is a problem with the pump? Yes. There is a pump memory alarm. If there is a pump memory error, the pump will sound a double-beep alarm. A pump memory error may occur if the pump memory iscompromised by a strong magnetic force or other circumstances (such as an MRI exam). Once activated, each alarm occurs at specic intervals until the doctor shuts the alarm off with the physician programmer. Under certain circumstances the pump alarm maysound intermittently. This could indicate that the battery is nearing depletion. If anintermittent alarm occurs, client should contact the doctor immediately.

The most common ways to pay for home care are: Personal and family resourcesPrivate insuranceMedicare, Medicaid, Department of Veteran Affairs, and Title programsCommunity-based ser vices To determine eligibility for nancial assistance, families should complete a full assessment of their nancial r esour ces. Impor tant steps to follow ar e: Identify cur rent assets, sour ces of income, and insurance entitlements. Prepareabudget and make pr ojections of futur eincome sources. Con rmthe r etirement bene ts of the person receiving your care. Estimate the expenses of pr ofessional car e, equipment, out of pocket medical expenses, and any medical pr ocedures that may be needed. Deter mine what care items and expenses are tax-deductible. Determine if the person's health insurance policy has home healthcare benets. Eligibility for public pay programs (Medicare, Medicaid, and Department of Veteran Affairs) should be discussed with an appropriate representative from these organizations.Some states have long-term care and/or personal-care assistant programs for people whoare not traditionally eligible for Medicaid. As a general rule, persons with MS are ineligible to purchase long-term care insurance once a diagnosis has been made. However, if there is a policy in place, this could be aresource for payment. WHO CAN ASSIST IN IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL RESOURCES? Families should begin by talking with the staff at their local National Multiple Sclerosis Society chapter or with a social worker at the local hospital, social agency, or MS clinic. Care managers can be most helpful by linking families to services and entitlements in the community. These professionals, usually a social worker or a nurse, are skilled inexploring eligibility for nancial assistance to cover home health services and will con-sult with other professionals to determine what assistive devices, home modications, orhousing alternatives are needed. Care managers can explore transportation resources andoptions, refer for individual or family counseling, and provide on-going support. Theycan be very effective advocates on behalf of clients. Home health car eis covered by a number of payers, including traditional Medicare, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, the Veterans' Administration, TRICARE, the FederalEmployees Health Benets Program, Older Americans Act programs, private insurance,and private pay .Medicar eis cur rently the lar gest payer of home health ser vices, with Medicaid incr easingly oriented towar ds rebalancing resources between institutional and home and community based ser vices, including personal car eservices designed to pr e- vent nursing home placement. MEDICARE COVERAGE FOR HOME HEALTH CARE There is no legal limit on the duration of time for which home health coverage is available. Further, Medicare covers home health services in full, with no required deductible orco-payments from the beneciary. Services must be medically necessary and reasonableand the following criteria must be met: Aphysician has signed or will sign a plan of care. The patient is or will be homebound. This criterion is met if leaving home requires aconsiderable and taxing effort which may be shown by the patient needing per- sonal assistance, or the help of a wheelchair or crutches, etc. Occasional but infre-quent \"walks around the block\" are allowable. 104The patient needs or will need physical or speech therapy, or intermittent skilled nursing (from once a day for periods of 21 days at a time if there is a predictableend to the need for daily nursing care, to once every 60 days). The home health care is provided by, or under arrangement with, a Medicare-certied provider. Ifthe triggering conditions described above are met, the beneciary is entitled to Medicare coverage for home health services. Home health services include: Part-time or intermittent nursing carePhysical, occupational, or speech therapyMedical social services under the direction of a physicianTo the extent permitted in regulations, part-time or intermittent services of a home health aide The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 made signicant revisions to the Medicare home health bene t(BBA). These changes apply to ser vices provided on or after January 1, 1998. While the BBA did not change the Medicare home health coverage criteria, the changes did alter the payment structure and, in practice, this change resulted in reduction in services,particularly for individuals in need of long ter mor extensive care. Denials of Medicare home health coverage should not be predicated upon particular diagnoses or the fact that apatient's condition is chronic or unlikely to improve. Each patient should be provided with an individualized assessment of his or her right to coverage in light of the qualifyingcriteria. Remember: Medicare coverage should not be denied simply because the patient's condition is \"chronic\" or stable.\" \"Restorative potential\" is not necessary. Resist arbitrary caps on coverage such as \" aide services in excess of one visit per day ar enot covered\", or that \"daily nursing visits can never be covered.\" There is no legal limit to the duration of the Medicare home health benefit. Medicare coverage is available for necessary home care even if it is to extend over along period of time. The doctor is the patient' smost impor tant ally .If it appears that Medicar ecoverage will be denied, the doctor needs to help demonstrate that the standar dsabove are met. Home care services should not be ended or reduced unless the doctor has ordered it. In or der to be able to appeal a Medicar edenial, the home health agency must have filed a Medicar eclaim for the patient's care, even if the agency expects that Medicare will deny coverage. Medicare home health care is not intended as only a short term benet for those with acute conditions. Accor ding to CMS' sHome Health Manual, HIM-11, 205.1, \"The determination of whether an individual needs skilled nursing care should be based 105solely upon the individual's unique condition and individual needs, without regard to whether the illness or injury is acute, chronic, terminal or expected to extend over along period of time. In addition, skilled care may, dependent upon the unique conditionof the individual, continue to be necessary for individuals whose condition is stable.\" Medicare provides the following illustration of the above policy: \"An individual with advanced multiple sclerosis undergoing an exacerbation of the illness needs skilled teaching of medications, measures to overcome urinaryretention, and the establishment of a program designed to minimize the adverseimpact of the exacerbation. The skilled nursing care the individual needs for ashort period would be covered despite the chronic nature of the illness.\" According to Medicare, skilled nursing visits can also be reasonable and necessary in the following circumstances: Observation and assessment of an individual's condition when only the specialized skills of a healthcare professional can: (1) determine an individual's status and thepotential for a change in condition, and (2) evaluate the need for possible modications of treatment or the need for new services until the individual is stable. Teaching and training activities requiring a skilled nurse to teach a individual, family member, or caregiver how to manage the beneciary's course of treatment, unless itbecomes apparent that they are not willing or capable of being trained. Management and evaluation of an individual Plan of Care where the individual's condition or complications require the services of a skilled nurse to ensure thatnon-skilled car e, e.g., home health aide ser vices, is achieving its purpose. 106APPENDIXG The Need for Rehabilitation in MS Rehabilitation in MS is a process that helps a person achieve and maintain maximal physical, psychological, social and vocational potential, and quality of life.Achievement and maintenance of optimal function are essential in a progressivedisease such as MS. Rehabilitation is consider ed a necessary component of comprehensive, quality health care for people with MS, at all stages of the disease. A growing body of evidenceindicates that impr ovement in mobility ,activities of daily living, quality of life, prevention of complications, and incr eased safety and independence may be r ealized by a car efully planned program of exercise, functional training, and activities that address the specific needs of the individual. Thirdparty reimbursement can be dif cult to obtain for people with MS, as insurers areoften looking to restoration and improvement as the rationale for coverage of rehabilitation services. Yet, for people with MS, maintaining functioning, or slowingdeterioration of functioning, are just as important. Inorder to help clinicians better advocate for patients with MS seeking rehabilitation therapies, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society has developed a tool kit of appealletters and citations to assist physicians in the appeal process. The following is atemplate letter that physicians can use in their appeal for physical rehabilitation.Copies of the citations cited in the letter can be obtained by contacting the Professional Resource Center of the Society at 1-866-MS-TREAT.108MODEL APPEAL LETTER\u2014REHABILITATION/PHYSICAL THERAPY Today's date Plan Name Plan Address Plan Address Re: Client's name, Insurance ID # (and claim # if applicable) To Whom It May Concern: This is a request for ( prior authorization, continuation of benets, appeal of your denial )for physical rehabilitation for my patient ____( name )____, who lives with multiple sclerosis. I prescribed a medically necessary program of ( inpatient or outpatient ) physical rehabilitation to enable her/him to achieve and maintain optimal functioning. Athorough physical therapy evaluation and development of a tr eatment plan by an appropriately skilled therapist is needed at this time (fill in specific details of short and long-ter mtreatment goals, e.g., to regain as much functioning as possible following an exacerbation, for symptom management, to develop risk r eduction strategies in the home, other\u2014site functional limitations, ADLs/IADLs, etc.) . The National Multiple Scler osis Society de nes rehabilitation as \"a process that helps a person achieve and maintain maximal physical, psychological, social and vocationalpotential, and quality of life consistent with physiological impair ment, envir onment, and life goals\". Fur ther, the Society's clinical guidelines assert that rehabilitation is an essential par tof the management of MS, including the r eduction of risk (see enclosed). The goal is to establish cor rective exer cises and activity pr ograms that ar eappropriate, realistic, and meaningful, with a strong focus on improving and maintaining function. The ef fectiveness of physical therapy in the MS population has been demonstrated. Di Fabio and colleagues r eported \"an extended outpatient rehabilitation program for persons with denite progressive MS appears to effectively reduce fatigue and the severity of other symptoms associated with MS\" ( Arch Phys Med Rehabil Feb 1989; 79). Another study concluded \"assessment of dif ferent aspects of motor impairment and the accurate determination of factors contributing to falls are necessary for individual patient management and therapy and for the development of a pr evention pr ogram for falls\" (Cattaneo, DeNuzzo, et al., Risk of Falls in Subjects with Multiple Scler osis. Arch Phys Med Rehabil June 2002; 83).

Thr ough its fty-state network of chapters, the Society funds research, furthers education, advocates and provides a variety of empowering programs for the approx-imately 400,000 Americans who have MS and their families. The National Multiple Scler osis Society was founded in 1946. Sylvia Lawr y,an dinar yordinar ycitizen whose br other suf fered fr om the disease, placed a classied advertisement in The New Y ork Times asking to hear fr om anyone who had recover ed fr om MS. However ,all of the letters she r eceived came from others who also sought help and hope. Instead of being discouraged, Ms. Lawr ymobilized a group of friends and advisors, including some who had answered her ad. From this the National Multiple Scler osis Society was for med to pr omote contacts among neurologists around the country who treated MS and to raise money to fund a search for answers. Today, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society supports more MS research, educates more healthcare professionals and serves more people with MS than any nationalvoluntary MS organization in the world and meets the standards of ALL majoragencies that rate not-for-profit groups. Across the country, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society has 2,700 volunteer leaders and over a million more volunteers to carry out its mission to end thedevastating effects of MS. The Society has over 600,000 general members, including280,000 who have MS. The Society's revenue is a combination of private donations,membership dues and contributions, legacies and bequests, and fund-raising events.Programs Offered by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society The National Multiple Sclerosis Society, through its chapters across the country, offers a wide range of programs and support services to people with MS. The Society also servesas an advocate for disability rights, improvements in healthcare delivery, access to ade-quate, affordable health insurance and long-term care, and federal funding of MS-relatedresearch. Many of these activities directly relate to the need for long-term care servicesand information. Society efforts include: Comprehensive Information and Referral Programs: Each chapter maintains a data- base of resources and information pertaining to all aspects of multiple sclerosisand services available in the community to meet the many needs generated bythe disease. Education: Chapters offer programs on all aspects of MS for people with MS, family caregivers, and healthcare professionals. Programs for people with MS and familiesemphasize the value of self-advocacy and empowerment in directing their MS care. Self-Help Groups and Counseling Programs: These ar eoffered to help people with MSand families cope with the day-to-day challenges of living with the emotional demands of this chronic, unpredictable and often disabling disease. There are over2000 Society-afliated support groups across the United States. Caregiver Supports: The Society recognizes that informal caregivers\u2014unpaid family, friends, and neighbors pr ovide the majority of long-ter mcare. Educational and support programs are offered by many chapters to help caregivers attend to their own emotional needs as well as learn how to best care and advocate for their lovedone with MS. Family Programs: The Society of fers a variety of pr ograms that bring families together for education, emotional suppor t, and/or social activities. These pr ograms are offered in recognition of the fact that MS affects each member of the family uniquely and generates different needs for each. Advocacy: The Society is a preeminent voice for people with disabilities who require access to the range of affordable, quality, and age-appropriate long-termcare services. Through the Society chapters and national government affairs officein W ashington, DC, advocates have a say in such long-ter mcareissues as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, policies regulating nursing home care, assisted living, independent living programs, insurance and more on a federal, state, andlocal level. Research: The Society suppor ts a wide range of clinical and scienti cresearch in MS. In addition, research in health services and policy provides data to support advocacy work and helps identify and document the unique long-term care andhealth management needs of people with MS. 112Specific Long-Term Care Programs: Many Society chapters collaborate with long- term care providers to develop and offer specialized long-term care programs forpeople with MS in their communities. For example, several specialized MS adult daycare programs and specialized MS nursing home programs are offered across thecountry. A number of MS care management, respite care programs and MS assistedliving programs have also been developed. To reach your National Multiple Sclerosis Society chapter call 1-800-FIGHT MS.
