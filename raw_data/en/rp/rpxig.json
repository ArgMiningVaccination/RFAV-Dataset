Homeopathy offers a unique solution as it works with the body's ability to heal itself, strengthening resilience and creating balance by building health from the very core. Unlike supplements which may support organ systems like the adrenals over time, homeopathy kick starts the body's own balancing mechanisms to stimulate the adrenals often more quickly. Homeopathy is also a natural medicine that is personalized to the unique situation and symptoms a person experiences, so rather than a blanket approach, each remedy is tailored to suit the individual. Below are some simple suggestions and recommendations for home remedies, but note that fatigue and burnout is typically so unique to each person that the expertise of a homeopath is often needed, especially if the situation and symptoms are not clearly matched with one of the homeopathy remedies below. Either way, the recommendations will offer a glimpse of the situations in which homeopathy can be effective. Flu fatigue: Homeopathic Gelsemium sempervirens Not able to recover after a viral sickness like the flu? Gelsemium 30ch may help bring you back on your feet. Choose Gelsemium if you feel weak and exhausted, sleeping more than usual but without the benefit of recovery. Lingering flu symptoms like an aching back and dull headaches may still persist long after other symptoms are gone. If this is the case, take Gelsemium 30ch two to three times daily for a few days to help you get your body back. Once you start to feel better, take it less often and stop when better. Night shift exhaustion: Homeopathic Cocculus indicus If instead, exhaustion has developed from lack of sleep or erratic sleep patterns while caring for the sick or repeated night shifts, consider Cocculus 30ch. Symptoms that suit this remedy are when dizziness and queasiness develop alongside fatigue. The weakness feels physical and there may be a feeling that the body and mind have slowed right down when tired. As with the previous remedies, take Cocculus 30ch two to three times daily for a few days and stop when better, you can always take a few doses if the symptoms return. Job burnout: Nux vomica If a type of nervous exhaustion results from too many long hours at work and looming deadlines, Nux vomica 30ch could be a good fit. Think of Nux vomica when the nervous system is on edge and you're feeling irritable, quick to be angry but also exhausted. The nerves are so irritated that there is a heightened sensitivity to noise, and sleep may be elusive, though if you can fall asleep and be undisturbed, you'll feel better. Along with the tense nerves, the muscles tense up and there can be physical cramping, such as stomach cramps, headaches and backaches which are relieved by warmth and rest. This remedy is a common one for our age of working all hours. Take Nux vomica for a few days to help your nervous system recover from overwork. Usually a few days is enough to recover, but don't forget to rest when the work is done! Homeopathic \"tonic\" Kali phos 6x A tonic is a medicinal substance to support vitality: in homeopathy the closest we have is the cell salt Kali phos 6x. While this remedy is one of the 12 mineral salts and is found in pill form rather than a tincture, it works like a tonic because the low potency supports and revitalizes the nervous system when periods of stress and worry bring it down. Kali phos 6x can be taken on its own or added to any well chosen homeopathic medicine to help settle an irritated nervous system due to stress and worry, alongside Nux vomica for instance This cell salt can also help with sleep - not by making you feel tired but rather by settling that frazzled feeling. As this is a low potency, it is recommended to repeat frequently and take for longer period of stress. Dosage: take 3-4 pills three to four times daily. If used for sleep, take an extra dose or two before bedtime, 15 minutes apart. When fatigue becomes chronic There are many more types of fatigue and exhaustion - for instance it's not uncommon for fatigue to appear during times of hormonal change as in menopause or postpartum. Not long ago, one young woman came to homeopathy feeling so drained that her life lacked joy and lustre even a year after the birth of her baby. She was experiencing hormonal imbalances along with irritability and just wanted to be left alone but luckily a friend suggested homeopathy. It was homeopathic Sepia which helped her gain her joy and energy back. But Sepia isn't the only postpartum remedy for exhaustion. Another mother who suffered a lack of vitality coupled with low immunity sought homeopathy after repeated sore throats and colds after her usual workout. Since the birth of her baby, she was sensitive to the least cold and lacked stamina. Homeopathic Silicea brought her immune system back on track, her energy improved and her whole vitality strengthened. If you are suffering from fatigue due to an imbalance in hormones, whether during postpartum or menopause, find a homeopathic practitioner for a series of well selected remedies to revitalize your health. In this audit on the success of homeopathy for menopausal symptoms: \"Patients reported significant benefit from the service. The greatest response was seen in those reporting headaches, vasomotor symptoms, emotional/psychological symptoms and tiredness/fatigue as their primary symptoms.\" The study was reviewed in the [Journal of the British Menopause Society.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15970019) Occasionally, fatigue is a sign of a more serious illness - when in doubt, or if you haven't had a check up in awhile, consult your family doctor to have your bloodwork reevaluated for a correct diagnosis. Homeopathy can be used on a holistic basis to support the body while waiting for a diagnosis or even after a diagnosis, as homeopathic medicine is an excellent adjunct, does not conflict with medications if required and works to rebalance and strengthen the body from the inside rather than just treating symptoms. Dosages for home remedies: The 30ch potency is widely available and can be used short term for any stressful period. For intense symptoms, take 5 pills two to three times daily for 3 days or so - if the problem if fairly new, the symptoms should subside fairly quickly. If symptoms improve soon after starting the remedies, repeat only if the symptoms return. If there is no change after a few days and you don't bounce back after a week or so, consult a homeopath for a more accurate choice of medicine. For mild symptoms, take the remedies once daily for a few days, see how the body responds and then repeat if needed.
