MARK CHANCE, DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR PROTEOMICS AND BIOINFORMATICS, SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, CASE WESTERN UNIVERSITY DR. NARAYANAN ``BOBBY'' KASTHURI, NEUROSCIENTIST, ARGONNE NATIONAL LABORATORY DR. HAROLD VARMUS, LEWIS THOMAS UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR, WEILL CORNELL MEDICINE Ms. Kaptur. The subcommittee will come to order and I want to thank everyone for coming, particularly our distinguished witnesses, all of whom are exceptional and precious in their scholarship and dedication to science and to healing. We are honored by your being with us today. We are here to discuss the topic of the Department of Energy's role in advancing biomedical sciences, a transformational role at the intersection of energy and health. After all, all of us are composed of a complex web of neurotransmitters, pulsing energy throughout our tissues, organs, and bones every day. This subcommittee has to be about more than just what we think of as conventional power. Indeed, the Department's long history and leadership in supporting basic science has resulted in biomedical innovations and a toolkit of advanced scientific capabilities that can enable future breakthroughs in health research, including artificial neurotransmitters, drug discovery, higher precision imaging to advance brain and nerve mapping, diagnostic technologies for cancer detection, and the use of technology to eliminate cancer's bad cells instead of adjacent good ones. We can think of a thousand goals beyond those. Let us first focus on the core of human function, the brain. For over three decades, Congress has funded increasingly advanced research on human brain function aimed at discovering and then healing medical conditions that alluded prior generations. Now, with advancing technology and the advent of supercomputing, science itself is maturing and combining information as evidenced by the wedding of biology and engineering, bioengineering, a term frankly that didn't exist when I went to college. And there are many more such examples in science. Our objective today is to probe where future scientific inquiry might be better directed to advance our understanding of human health such as better comprehension of brain function and then unravel incompletely understood brain impairments with the objective of healing. If I were to ask the question what does medical science understand and not understand about varying conditions like bipolar, post-traumatic stress, and CTE, brain injuries, what might researches tell us about physical proper and biologic impaired functions in each? Although the Department of Energy pursues research in areas directly pertinent to the Department's main mission of energy, environmental stewardship, and national security, basic research undertaken for one purpose often has unanticipated and major impacts in other areas. That is why it is critical to support basic science research at the Department and this subcommittee surely has. In fiscal year 2020, we increased funding to the Department's Office of Science by $415 million to a record level of $7 billion. This funding is foundational for a new generation of discoveries at the intersection of health and energy. For example, in conducting basic science research for other purposes, Brookhaven National Lab helped pioneer the PET scan technology that many of our colleagues have experienced in their own family life. Additionally, while pursuing its mission-driven research, the Department of Energy has developed advanced scientific capabilities that can provide unique benefits to the biomedical sciences. The Department's x ray light sources and the nanoscale science research centers provide special imaging capabilities for the biomedical research community. The x ray light sources produce x rays that are billions of times brighter than medical x rays and have been used by scientists and pharmaceutical companies to develop drugs and treatment for neurological diseases like Alzheimer's, cancers, diabetes, and the development of new vaccines like the Ebola vaccine. In better understanding how drug molecules interact with human cells, hopefully we can start to understand better why some pharmacological treatments work for some patients but not for others. If we could more seamlessly use the scientific capacity of the Department of Energy to probe the medical unknowns, what breakthroughs could our Nation archive? The Department of Energy's high performance computing capabilities can also provide solutions to biomedical applications through simulation and modeling to predictive biology through artificial intelligence and data analytics. Just imagine the computing power and data analytics need to map billions upon billions of brain cells so we can reveal the brain's neurological and biochemical interworkings. Through the Department of Energy's isotopes program, the national labs and the network of universities have impressive capacities in producing medical isotopes that are useful in nuclear medicine and radiotherapy. As we will hear from our witnesses, advances in the science of energy as well as biomedicine depend increasingly upon integrating many other disciplines with the biological sciences. It was not so long ago that universities began offering programs as I have mentioned like bioengineering, two sciences that had remained separated on university campuses for generations. Given the unique scientific tools and personnel of the Department of Energy and its national labs, and the potential for future breakthroughs in health fields, it seems especially important for the Department of Energy to increase coordination and collaboration with the National Institutes of Health and other Federal agencies, including the Department of Defense. This will give the best chances of developing new innovations in biomedical sciences to unlock the hidden mysteries of the human brain, retool the human body when it has been broken, save lives, and sustain life on Earth. To our distinguished witnesses, we look forward to hearing from each of you. I will now turn to our distinguished ranking member, Mr. Simpson, for opening remarks who as a respected dentist in his home profession well knows the advances in technology that begin with his own profession. Mr. Simpson. [The prepared statement you, Chairwoman Kaptur. Timing is everything, you know. The knee replacement wasn't bad enough, this morning I had to go and have my annual eye checkup so my eyes are dilated and I can barely read this. So if I stumble along, I am hopeless today. Anyway, thank you, Chairwoman Kaptur. I know today's topic has long been of particular interest to you and I look forward to discussing these issues in more detail. I would like to join you in welcoming the witnesses to today's hearing. We always appreciate it when experts such as yourselves are willing to take time out of your schedules to come and talk to us about what you do and what it is or is not--and what is or is not working with current Federal actives. Over the past few decades, we have seen many exciting and literally life changing advances in biomedical sciences. One example I always found particularly interesting and maybe it is because I was sitting on my patio at home during the August break in Idaho when my phone rang and I picked it up and it was Secretary Perry and he was in California at Berkeley. He says you have got to come down here and see this. What are you talking about, Mr. Secretary? He says they just showed me an example of a thing where they could take a blood sample and within 10 minutes they can run a thing on it, I mean, like they do when they, you know, your sugar levels or whatever. They can tell if you have had a brain injury, if you have had a concussion. And he said think what it means to everything from our soldiers to people playing football. No longer do you have to go through the how many fingers is it and can you pronounce it and all that kind of stuff. That was made possible because of the computers at the Department of Energy. So there are many exciting things happening. Some of these advances have come about due to at least in part to the Department of Energy whether it is research being done at the DOE user facilities such as the light sources or research intended to advance DOE's missions that was found to have biomedical applications. DOE has been an important partner in advancing biomedical research. I look forward to hearing more details on how DOE can improve its partnerships with NIH and relevant nonfederal entities to make even better use of the user facilities and research efforts to further advance biomedical science. I will also like to hear how we can improve these partnerships in a way that maintains appropriate focus on the fundamental missions of the separate Federal agencies. Advances in biomedical science are certainly in the national interest, but so too are advances in energy, environment, and national security. In fact, I would offer this cautionary note. NIH funding in fiscal year 2020 was $41.7 billion. Funding at DOE's Office of Science where most biomedical related work is done was $7 billion. So we need to ensure that improving collaboration between these agencies does not lead to diverting the already much smaller DOE science budget away from advancing DOE's missions. Better collaboration between DOE and NIH can be a win-win for both agencies and both missions, we just need to make sure that we keep that goal in mind as we look at delivering future efforts. I look forward to learning from our witness today about the challenges, the successes, and the ideas for improvement in this area and I thank Chairwoman Kaptur for calling this hearing. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you, Mr. Simpson, very much and obviously we are very excited for our witnesses and to hear from them. I just wanted to add a sentence. What partly tripwired this hearing this morning was I was out at Walter Reed's Intrepid Center and meeting with our veterans and looking at some of the conditions that they are enduring. And we walked in one room there and I saw a machine I had never seen in my life called an electro machine invented by the Swedes. And I watched a veteran go through the imaging and then up on a screen very quickly they were able to go deep into the brain and identify the filament that caused his most recent stroke. I was completely fascinated. I felt like I was in a new age, I thought ``I am really in the 21st century''. So how do we, knowing what we do here, how do we help the science advance more quickly and go deeper into the human body and help healing? Our witnesses today are extraordinary. First we will have Dr. Harold Varmus, who is the Lewis Thomas University professor at Weill Cornell Medicine and a recipient of the Nobel Prize for studies of the genetic basis of cancer. He served as the director of the National Cancer Institute for 5 years and director of the National Institutes of Health for 6. Dr. Varmus also co-chaired the Secretary of Energy's Advisory Board Task Force on Biomedical Sciences. Following that, we will have Dr. Mark Chance, the director of the Center for Proteomics and Bioinformatics at Case Western Reserve University in the state that I represent, and vice dean for research at its school of medicine. Dr. Chance also directs the Case Center for Synchrotron Biosciences located at Brookhaven National Labs' light source. And I can recall a moment when the director of that lab gave me a lesson on ions for which I was very grateful and remain so. And finally, we will have Dr. Narayanan Kasthuri, a neuroscience researcher at Argonne National Lab who is also an assistant professor of neurobiology. That name didn't exist when I was in college, at the University of Chicago. Thank you all for taking the time to be here today. I want to thank our Members for attending. Without objection, your written statements will be entered into the record. Please feel free to summarize your remarks, although I want to hear every word, starting with Dr. Varmus. Welcome. STATEMENT OF DR. HAROLD VARMUS Dr. Varmus. Well, thank you to the committee for holding this important hearing. Now, I think I was audible before. Let me start with a brief reminder. The body, as the chairwoman has pointed out, is made up of physical entities and the strengths of the Department of Energy have been reflected in medical science and responsible for many of the advances we have made in health for a century. Think about imaging with x rays and radioisotope and MRI imaging. Think about the way we monitor the heart and the brain with electrocardiograms and electroencephalograms. Think about how we analyze the blood by looking at chemicals. Think about how we take all that data and crunch it with computational tools and how we simulate with engineering tools. These are just a small sampling of the disciplines that have been championed by the DOE Office of Science, physical sciences, engineering, computation, that contribute to biology in medicine. Now, as the chairwoman has pointed out, I have had a number of Federal positions in which I have been able to observe some of the contributions made by DOE from a front row seat. Let me just mention two. First, the Human Genome Project, if we can have the first image, please, which was initiated at a DOE lab in the 1980s. Most of the genome of human beings and other organisms were determined by a small number of centers, one of which was run by the DOE even though the NIH was coordinating this international project and these shared interests persist through computation, the study of many other organisms, and through the development of faster and cheaper machines for sequencing DNA. A second example is in structural biology. And when I was director of NIH and Ernie Moniz was the undersecretary of Energy in the Clinton administration, we made a deal that actually transferred the money, Mr. Simpson's point, from the NIH to DOE, DOE cyclotrons to sustain beam lines for doing structural examinations of important proteins that serve as machines by carrying out cell function. The ribosome for protein synthesis, complex enzymes that copy DNA into RNA, membrane proteins that react with drugs or are responsible for the transport of water across membranes and these interests also persist through development of cryo- electron microscopy, neuron beams for pursuing the structure of proteins at a more refined level. Now, as the chairwoman alluded to, after I left the National Cancer Institute in 1915--2015, sorry. I'm not that old. I'm not that old. In 2015, Ernie Moniz, who was then the Secretary of Energy, asked me to join the Secretary of Energy's advisory group and to co-chair a working group on the topic of today's hearing. And we were asked to assess the opportunities for better coordination between the NIH and the DOE's Office of Science and to strengthen those relationships. We conducted several workshops to talk about a variety of disciplines that are particularly relevant to DOE's activities, material science, fabrication, nanotechnology, sensor development, radiobiology imaging, advanced computation, other things in the context of many of the existing initiatives at the NIH in Precision Medicine, the Cancer Moonshot, the so- called BRAIN program, microbial drug resistance, and others. And in the course of these hearings, we learned something quite important about the differences of the scientific cultures supported by these two agencies. The NIH traditionally depending on the imagination of individual investigators with small labs getting individual grants from the NIH. The DOE through its national laboratories is carrying out mission- driven science, developing technologies, and that fundamental cultural difference is an important one I will come back to. We recommended many ways in which these past activities could be enriched and fostered but we came out in addition with four overarching recommendations that are relevant to today's discussion: how we convene panels of experts to identify opportunities for research programs, how we share the cultures of the two agencies, how we establish facilities for large- scale, newly identified missions, and how we can report to more often as we are doing today to committees like this about what we do. I am going to just say a few words briefly about the consequences of this report that we wrote for SEAB because what I have found in response to the invitation to speak here today by talking to many officials in both agencies that the sprit and the letter of the report are thriving through joint projects, large and frequent consultations and work of individual scientists engaged with both agencies. And I am going to mention in conclusion if I can have the liberty of one additional moment, Madame Chairwoman, two joint programs that are important to me. One is a current initiative in the cancer domain which is my own area of research and as you can see, maybe you can't see because the type is not that large, there are a series of the many things going on between NIH and DOE, a set of projects that involve the National Cancer Institute's mission to study better ways to improve outcomes for cancer patients mainly through better use of high performance computing. Second, to be able to visualize in higher resolution the position and function of proteins that we know to be responsible for driving about one third of human cancers, and another pilot project that helps to enrich our epidemiological surveys. The second of these is actually being carried about at the Frederick National Lab for Cancer Research, a national lab that is run by the National Cancer Institute. When I was director there, we modeled that lab carefully on the examples provided by many of DOE's national lab establishing an initiative to study what we call RAS proteins, these proteins that drive cancers. And we now have, if we can move the slides along, an effort that is bearing fruit to study how RAS proteins interact with cell membranes in ways that I don't really have time to describe in detail. That model has been expanded to include public private partnerships. You can advance the slides to one more, one more. To include, not just DOE and NIH but University of California San Francisco, the academic sector, and the private sector. I would like to conclude with a suggestion. In our report, we talk about scanning the horizon for problems that we can solve through national labs and interactions between NIH and DOE. You may have seen a number of reports that talk about the way in which the pharmaceutical industry and the biotech industry are having difficulty financially and scientifically in coping with the spread of organisms that are resistant to antibiotics. Many of these commercial forms are retreating from the foray to try to identify new antibiotics because the economics don't favor that kind of investment. And there have been stories in the New York Times and elsewhere on this topic. I think it is possible to think, to consider, next slide please, taking an organization like that which resembles the molecular foundry at the Lawrence Berkeley lab and turn that into a place where individual NIH-sponsored students of new antibiotics and microbial threats could be put into a setting where the flexible and deep technological advances could be used to identify new targets for antibiotic action. To try to find new antibiotic molecules and use that government resource and the collaboration between these two agencies to meet a problem which WHO and NIH and many others see as one of the great threats to human survival in the next century. So, I want to thank you for having this hearing. I want to thank the two organizations, NIH and DOE, for their activities in the past to sponsor these highly active and fruitful collaborative arrangements and be pleased to answer any questions you might have. Thank you for the extra time. [The prepared statement of Dr. Varmus follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT TIFF FORMAT] Ms. Kaptur. Thank you, Dr. Varmus. Thank you for your time. Dr. Chance. STATEMENT OF DR. MARK CHANCE Mr. Chance. Good morning Chairwoman Kaptur, Ranking Member Simpson, thank you so much for the opportunity to talk today. My testimony, I hope, is very simple. DOE science facilities are critical to America's basic biomedical science, drug and device development and public health goals of the Nation. With positive effects on the health and welfare of all American's and saving many lives. What is my evidence? Well, I would like to focus on new drug development where over 90 percent of the newly approved drugs result from projects that use DOE facilities, specifically synchrotron methods to see the structure of the drugs target. This site allowed the drugs to be developed more quickly as well as resulting in safer and more effective medicines. In the first slide, we can dig a little and explore these DUE facilities called synchrotrons. There are five of them across the country. They are large physics facilities producing very intense x rays for a wide range of scientific applications. Material science, chemistry, physics and biology. With the help of Brookhaven National Lab, we did some research for this hearing and found there are 42 dedicated biomedical beamlines currently at the synchrotrons around the country, 3,000 biomedical or about 4,000 biomedical science users among the 12,000 users overall of the synchrotrons. Dr. Varmus alluded to the Nobel Prizes in biology and the users published 1,200 papers last year and enabled 100 companies to move their research forward. We can go to the next slide. I want to introduce the Center for Synchrotron Biosciences. As Chairwoman Kaptur noted, it is located at Brookhaven National Laboratory. I established the center many years ago to make collaboration between the NIH and its funded users, academia, and the DOE easier. To provide a platform to develop collaborations, to bring in technologies and most of all, in terms of that cultural piece that Dr. Varmus referred to, to invent new uses of x rays and other light beams to see the structures of drug targets and other biomolecules in novel ways to speed medications to patients. The results have been very gratifying for myself and my colleagues. Over the years, we have built 10 beamline instruments. Hundreds of institutions have participated, thousands of users, 2,500 publications so far. The funding to build and operate these facilities has come from the NIH and the NSF. And we have made key technology partnerships with various organizations to move things forward. One of our most recent partners is the NIH and the Cancer Institute and the RAS program which Dr. Varmus referred to. If I could have the next slide. So, one of the things we did and Dr. Varmus referred to it, is we stepped up the rate of structured determination. We partnered between the NIH and the DOE and we built beamlines that could allow us to see these drug targets, many more of them. And I think the results are pretty good. There were fewer than 10,000 protein structures before we started this collaboration. There are 160,000 now. And they are coming out at a phenomenal rate. And these structures were determined at DOE synchrotrons and also around the world where these synchrotrons are considered very important. Just to add, there are probably 100 synchrotrons under construction or in operation around the world right now. So, what is the data? Well, if we looked at the 210 new drugs that were approved between 2010 and 2016, 93 percent of them relied on protein structure information provided by DOE's and other synchrotrons. That was about a rate of a 30 per year. We are now, the last 3 years, we are at 50 a year. And you know why that is, at least to me, or which might be plausible, there is a delay between the time you finish the structure and you get the FDA approval. And you see that curve, 10 years ago was on a very steeply rising part of that curve. So, I would argue we are on the cusp as we bring in machine learning, artificial intelligence and the computational power of the DOE to accelerate this process dramatically. If I could go to the last slide. What is coming? New facilities, new beamlines to solve new challenges. And the Center for Synchrotron Biosciences is in the forefront. We have completed a new beamline at Brookhaven to solve important medical challenges. The number one we have just solved is we solved the structure of the human nuclear receptor. That is going to be important for tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer which develops. Nobody knew what that molecule looked like before and it was really hard to drug and it was really hard to approach without seeing. Because seeing means understanding. We are also solving structures of proteins important in Alzheimer's and Mad Cow Disease and very important to today, we are studying virus structures. Just last week, Perdue scientists were at the Argonne Synchrotron looking at forms of coronavirus that match the Wuhan strain to try to rush vaccines and drugs into development. So again, I thank you so much for the opportunity to speak today. In conclusion, I want to thank you, the appropriators. Your investments are paying off and thousands of Americans lives are going to be changed as a result of it. I would be happy to answer any questions. Oh, do we have one more slide, do we have The Shoe? With your permission, Madam Chairwoman. Ms. Kaptur. Oh, please proceed, Dr. Chance, yes. Mr. Chance. So, we were thinking to try to illustrate to the committee the scale of these facilities. They are expensive, right? So, I thought let us give an image which many in Ohio know. That is Ohio stadium, The Shoe. And I had a side bet that the National Synchrotron Light Source II was bigger than The Shoe. And as you see, a half one. The Shoe is taller, on top, and there is the National Synchrotron Light Source. NSLS is bigger so the bet was a push, nobody won. But thousands of people, 100,000 of people are entertained on a Saturday in The Shoe and thousands of the Nation's researchers are served yearly at the National Synchrotron Light Source II. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Dr. Chance follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE TIFF FORMAT] [GRAPHIC(S) IN TIFF FORMAT] Ms. Kaptur. Thank you, Dr. Chance, very much. Dr. Kasthuri. STATEMENT OF DR. NARAYANAN KASTHURI Dr. Kasthuri. Chairwoman Kaptur, Ranking Member Simpson, members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you to talk today. My name is Bobby Kasthuri and I am a neuroscientist in the U.S. Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory and an assistant professor in the Department of Neurobiology at the University of Chicago. And what I would like to talk to you about today is that we stand at a pivotal moment in our centuries' long quest to understand the brain. It is actually a moment when multiple scientific worlds are colliding. The worlds of computer science, bioimaging and microscopy, and neuroscience are now colliding. My research specifically leverages the capabilities of the national lab system to accelerate that collision. Specifically, by mapping brains at the finest scales and analyzing the resulting enormous datasets. It is from this perspective that I present to you my testimony today. As you heard, one of the great intellectual challenges of the 20th century was our understanding of the genetic basis of life. And the Human Genome Project is perhaps the pinnacle of that effort. It is important to remember that the Human Genome Project was born out of the collaborative efforts of the National Institutes of Health and the DOE. It is perhaps one of the first and most successful big data and healthcare collaborations ever and its impact continues to reverberate through biology and medicine. It is also, for the purposes of this hearing, an example of how the DOE and the national labs are uniquely suited to play a similar role in tackling the great intellectual challenge of the 21st century which is mapping and understanding the human brain. And it is the enormity of the human brain that requires this collaboration. The human brain, your brains, contain about 100 billion brain cells or neurons. Each of which makes on order 10,000 connections with each other. One way to think about that is a single brain contains more connections that there are stars in the Milky Way galaxy. And the complexity of this intricate communication web cannot be overstated. As neuroscientists, we believe that making a map of these connections can provide answers to some of the fundamental questions about how brains work. Such a map, which we call a connectome, is a map of everything about you: your skills, your memories, your fears, and your personality. Disruptions or alterations in this map, miswirings if you will, between neurons are the basis of many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Using facilities like Argonne's advanced photon source and high-performance computers, we plan to map the normal brain which will allow us to treat diseases like Autism Spectrum Disorder, schizophrenia, concussion-related neuropathies, and dementia. To kind of give you an idea of what is capable, if we could play the first video please. What you are looking at is based on work I started as a postdoc. It is the first map of a human brain connectome by teams at Harvard University and Google. You are seeing the individual processes and connections of millions of neurons in the human brain traced by AI algorithms developed by Google. And for the first time, you will see three-dimensional models of connections in the human brain. Each of those is one of the many neurons of the human brain. But even this effort, which tests the resources of bleeding edge researchers represents much less than 1 percent of the volume of the entire human brain. The raw data of the atlas of human connections, i.e., the human connectome would you require approximately 1 trillion gigabytes, a zettabyte, and could not fit in the memory of any computer today. The entire Human Genome Project requires maybe a few gigabytes. Another way to say this is that all the written material in the Library of Congress, all the movies and audio that humans have produced since the dawn of civilization, would be just a small fraction of the data of one human connectome. Thus, the interdisciplinary capabilities of the DOE national laboratories and their world-class user facilities like computing, are our best chance to transform the way we understand the brain. Scientists from Argonne National Lab and the University of Chicago in collaboration with researchers across the United States, including Case Western, are already working towards a human connectome by mapping smaller brains of other animals such as mice. But for most neuroscientists, the tools they require to map the brain, particularly the computer, are too expensive and require investments in physics, engineering, and computer science. Not only beyond the scope of individual laboratories but probably entire universities. These barriers prevent the neuroscience community from asking the best questions about the brain and limit the type of collaborations that drive innovation. We need to democratize this widening gap between the small fraction of laboratories developing and utilizing the most advanced technology and the majority of neuroscientists. A collaboration between DOE and NIH could provide these maps and the tools to make these maps to the national neuroscience community. A revolution awaits us when we understand how human brains acquire knowledge from experience, how we find patterns in our senses, and how we plan things and make decisions and act. When we know exactly how these processes work, we can connect prosthetic limbs to the paralyzed, design rational medical treatments for brain diseases, and ultimately try to reverse engineer human cognition into our own computers. As I said, we stand at a pivotal moment in the history of our country. Understanding the brain will help provide U.S. leadership in neuroscience in the coming decades the way the moon landing in 1969 and the Human Genome Project contributed to U.S. technological and scientific leadership. The national laboratories, the source of some of our most powerful scientific tools, combined with the research and development of the NIH can revolutionize our understanding of the brain to develop better treatments for millions of people worldwide affected by neurological disorders. And perhaps most importantly, the DOE and NIH together can achieve generational science. Removing boundaries between fields of science and creating these transformative moments that shape society for generations to come. Thank you for your time and attention today. I welcome any questions you have. [The prepared statement of Dr. Kasthuri follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT IN TIFF FORMAT] Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much, Dr. Kasthuri and all of our witnesses. We appreciate your statements and they will be placed in the record along with any other materials you wish to submit to us. Since this is the first hearing of the year, I would like to remind Members about our hearing rules. For those Members present in the room when we gaveled in the beginning of the hearing, I will recognize you for questions in order of seniority alternating between majority and minority until all who arrived prior to the gavel have asked questions. For those who arrive after the hearing has started, I will recognize those Members solely in order of arrival and again alternating between majority and minority. Last thing, I intend to try to observe the 5-minute rule for questions and answers, and we will now begin questioning under our normal rules. Dr. Kasthuri, I wanted to begin with you. One of my own deep interests is understanding the function and impaired function of the human brain to advance diagnosis and treatment for those who suffer from neurological and biochemical brain imbalances. If one looks at the last--back at the last 5 years in our Nation, we have witnessed some troubling trends. The number of individuals, particularly young men between the ages of 15 and 35, who are taking their own lives. Also, we know we have large numbers of afflicted warriors, wounded warriors experiencing brain trauma and post-traumatic stress. We have an opioid crisis with tens of thousands of harmful self-medicators and there are harm perpetrators in our society taking the lives of others at a very troubling rate. Most have needed brain-centered medical help but it was either not available locally nor if diagnosis was accurate, a proper healing course of treatment was not effective. Because we are Members of the House, we experience these individuals at ground level. And it becomes part of our responsibility to meet that human need. I believe improved diagnosis of neurochemically brain-centered medical conditions to be a significant national priority. Medical science needs even better imaging as part of the solution. One of the first types of brain scan or neuroimaging occurred in 1927. It was called the cerebral arteriogram. But it took about 3 decades until a computerized tomography emerged to benefit medical diagnostics. A little later, magnetic resonance imaging was developed by researchers. I can still remember as a young member of the Veterans Committee when I first arrived, when at one of our VA centers turned it on and anything that was metal attached to it. And the nurses were running down the hallways. And so, you know, we have witnessed this in our lifetime. This technology identifies atoms by how they behave in a magnetic field. A highly useful, noninvasive procedure for imaging internal bodily structure and advancing medical diagnostics well beyond where the technology had previously existed. Existing imaging technologies have transformed medicine forever. But we ask ourselves, what are the next horizons? I mentioned my experience at Walter Reed Intrepid Center where the researchers and doctors are trying to help veterans who present with a whole range of conditions based on their military service and having been wounded in theater. Dr. Kasthuri, what can we do to advance technological research faster to improve imaging technologies or other technologies you would all recommend to better capture deep brain tissue and neurochemical function and to identify malfunction? How can we better brain imaging more precisely to map neurochemical dysfunction that may be occurring as well as understanding reactions to pharmacological or other treatments to improve patient outcomes? I know that is a mouthful. But if you were to sort of point the ship in the right direction, what can you add to your formal testimony to guide us? Dr. Kasthuri. Chairwoman Kaptur, thank you. That is an excellent question. I will try my best to give my version of it. Many of the things you mentioned, I am not an expert in personally, some of the other techniques. I work specifically on the very finest resolution reconstructions of the brain, at the level of how every neuron collects to every other neuron. Since, as neuroscientists, we know that is likely the basis of both our normal behavior and our aberrant behavior, getting those maps will be the first steps to sort of understanding how the physical circuitry underlies these behavioral defects. So I think there is a lot of technological advancement that we can make. But I think the second point that I would like to emphasize is that there is a lot of technology already currently available. A lot of technology is being developed thanks to funding from committees like you and other committees for the BRAIN initiative, et cetera. I think a real problem that we could solve right away is giving access to that technology to the broadest set of scientists possible. And I think that this is a place where DOE user facilities combined with neuroscience questions can add immediate impacts on distributing technology that is already available. In terms of how do we get to future technology, I think the answer is more money will always help for the future, but for now, I think there is an opportunity to take the technology we already have and distribute it as widely as possible. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you. Would any other witnesses like to comment on that question? Dr. Varmus. Dr. Varmus. There is a useful analogy here with the human genome project where we begin the project not knowing whether it was technically feasible but we had a pretty good idea of how we would use the data once we got it because we knew that genes encode proteins, proteins carry out certain functions. I think in the BRAIN initiative we are taking a more adventurous step and one that, I think, is going to have remarkable dividends, but is one we undertake not knowing what we will make of the connectome once we describe it. So the technology is developing; it is very important to do this; but we have to do this recognizing that we are taking on a remarkable revolutionary adventure, one that is incredibly important to the survival of our species, and one that is going to have tremendous dividends, but we have to undertake it recognizing that simply having the connectome is not going to tell us how these diseases arise. And we are in this for a very long haul and I hope we will be there. Ms. Kaptur. Are we properly organized in terms of the connectome to really advance the science quickly? Dr. Kasthuri. So it is hard for me to say are we properly organized at a national scale. My suspicion is no because it is so recent, it is such a new technology, and a new capability that, I think, we have an opportunity to organize at this moment and I think it is the right moment to think about national organization of these efforts. I think Dr. Varmus would know how to organize at a national scale. I will let him. Dr. Varmus. Well, I would just point out again an analogy with the genome project. That began by looking at the genome, not of human beings, but the genome of bacteria, of worms, of flies, and, indeed, part of the connectome of the fruit fly, the traditional model organism for experimental biology has just been published. And I think we can, by observing what happens with those preliminary incomplete connectomes and model organisms, we will learn what is needed to bring the right people together around the table to try to interpret just as we have brought people together from a variety of medical fields to interpret some of the early genomes that were deciphered. So, I think, there are models here to look at to try to figure out the best way to organize the right people to deal with these tremendous datasets. But DOE should certainly be among those folks involved. Ms. Kaptur. Well, we obviously would benefit greatly by your thinking through how best to organize that inquiry and what DOE's role might be, and where that might be housed, or which places it might be, but what we might do to help you advance knowledge there. Dr. Varmus. It is a question worth posing to some of the panels that are currently meeting between DOE and NIH to talk about how the two organizations work together in other domains where the rules are, perhaps, better understood. I think you already have people who are sitting down on a very regular basis to talk about what brain research has been done, about genomic research, about cancer research, about research on antimicrobial organisms, antimicrobial drugs. I think there are places where you could get very good information about how to organize a larger effort to understand these very rich datasets will be coming from research of the kind Dr. Kasthuri was describing. Ms. Kaptur. Where was the fruit fly connectome, where was that done? Dr. Varmus. It was done mainly by, organized by Howard Hughes Medical Institute, at Janelia Farm, and in collaboration with NIH-sponsored investigators. I am sure that by consulting with people from both agencies that are working within the domain of the BRAIN initiative, you can identify the right people. Ms. Kaptur. Dr. Chance. Mr. Chance. I would just like to add one point. I agree completely with my colleagues and I just want to emphasize why it is important. Because in mental health diagnoses or pain, we do not generally have independent ways of seeing if you are getting better. We ask you. And it is just not that precise. But if we could have a meter that was unbiased and quantitative for some of these things, then we can really see if the pills or the behavioral interventions or the other things we are doing are really making a difference for the patient. We lack that unbiased measure as opposed to how are you feeling today? Ms. Kaptur. I have to put this on the record because I have worked on it for almost 20 years and this relates to returning veterans who have all sorts of conditions. And I will just take my own State. We work with our National Guard and, actually, Case Western to collect, along with several of the universities around the country working with our National Guard, DNA specimens voluntarily given from veterans. So to try to contribute to a bank of DNA that one could then study why did the veteran have this condition versus that condition, and we worked with scientists at Case, and why would someone develop PTS and someone else not. But as the scientists worked, their conclusions had nothing to do with the brain, directly with what we are talking about today, but, rather, that you would develop a condition because you had experienced violence prior to enlistment in the military and that wound remains. And then if you get in a situation where there are other stressors that happen, you would develop it faster than someone else. I was very gratified for the conclusion they came up with, but I say to myself we have this mammoth set of DNA samples, where does this fit in? Where does the diagnostics for this fit in? And I just point that out to you, Dr. Chance, because if you go visit the Walter Reed Intrepid Center you will see what we are trying to do there to help our returning veterans. And I know this isn't the Veterans Committee, but the machines that are used and the technologies that we are engaged with, some of them came out of the field of energy. We really have a very poor understanding of what is going on. And so my question really is, if you could go back to Case and take a look at who has the DNA bank that has been developed, does it fit anywhere in medical research? They have certainly attempted to work with the Department of Defense on this, but they are not the places that are inventing, necessarily, the kind of technologies that you are. But for a Member, it is frustrating to have this rich bank, but it's underutilized in terms of research. So I just point that out. Maybe other members have other experiences, and I will turn this over to Mr. Simpson now for his questioning. But it just seems to me to be hard to get your hands around, what can we do to move this field faster and to get better diagnostics? Thank you. Mr. Simpson. Mr. Simpson. Thank you, Chairwoman Kaptur. Dr. Chance, I am shocked that after just having my knee replaced and going into the doctor when they say what pain level are you at today, and they have those 10 faces, that that is not a scientific analysis of my pain level. Mr. Chance. That is about as scientific as we have got today. Mr. Simpson. That is about right. I sit there and they say what pain level are you at, and I kind of go, I like that guy. Mr. Chance. So you see how hard it is to really know if our interventions are working because it is based on how you are feeling, all of the things that are integrating into you as a person and maybe it is just the knee we care about for this visit, right. Mr. Simpson. That is right. Anyway, thank you for coming today, all of you, and for your testimony. What you do is vitally important to this country and the people of this country. I have always been a fan of NIH. I served on the Labor-H Committee; and whenever I get depressed--it seems more frequently lately--but whenever I get depressed, I go out to NIH because it is fascinating I always walk away from there amazed. I do the same thing when I go to our 17 national laboratories and the work that is being done at those laboratories, I walk away, I don't understand any of it, but I know it is amazing. But we are the Appropriations Committee, and the question I have is--could you go back to Dr. Chance's first slide, just out of curiosity? Yeah, you just had it. OK, you talked about the impact of those DOE light sources on biomedical research. Who pays for that? What is our role as the Appropriation Committee with the Department of Energy, what do we pay for? The drug companies that get the benefit of that research and stuff, how much do they pay for? I am trying to figure out how I could determine what an appropriate level of appropriation is and what I am going to get out of that appropriation without interfering with the role of what those laboratories are. And I am one who believes that collaboration and using things to their best uses is vitally important. Do you understand my question? I am not sure I do. Mr. Chance. Yes. So there are many stakeholders who come to the table and have paid for those beam lines. There is some money from DOE. There is some money came from the National Institutes of Health. There is the money from the National Science Foundation which was used to build the beam line I operate correctly, and the universities are putting in money, the companies are putting in money, foundations are putting in money. So it is quite shared. And so those 42 beam lines, you did not have to pay for all of them, right. That is, you put some table stakes up, right, and then everybody said yeah, I am in. This is consistent with my mission; I want to play; I want to be involved. And so that is how we attract investment to your sort of base support you provide for the DOE. So as a university researcher, I am out looking for collaborators, grants, so I can bring money, ideas, and partners to the facility to get the job done. So what is the right mix? That is a very hard question, and we have issues of, you know, agencies have missions and OMB does not like lane jumping, I have heard. Mr. Simpson. Yeah, believe or not, yeah. Mr. Chance. Yeah, believe it or not. So how do we sort of be intelligent about that to encourage collaboration with that? And we do not want lane jumping either, right. You do not want to be paying two or three times for the same thing. So how do we do it efficiently? And by enabling the different stakeholders to get--I think Dr. Varmus laid out the steps, right, the four: we need to convene; we need to understand cultural differences; we need to make sure the facilities are operating at peak technology and in terms of numbers; and we need to tell you about it and get your feedback. Dr. Varmus. Just to comment briefly on this because as I alluded to in my testimony, in the 1990s, when Ernest Moniz was the undersecretary, we worked out an agreement by which certain NIH institutes, based on the grants they were giving to structural biologists who were working at Brookhaven and other national labs, we made an agreement that we would pay for a certain fraction of the total cost for maintenance of the synchrotrons that were produced in those beam lines. And that has continued over the years, and being adjusted according to use. I think we actually have made, by bringing in other potential funders, particularly good use of the infrastructure initially provided mostly by DOE with supplementation from NSF, as Dr. Chance has pointed out. I think that has been quite well managed, but it would be useful for you to bring in some people who are responsible for those allocations and check out whether they are in accord with your principles as appropriators. Mr. Chance. I would like to make two additional quick points, and one is National Science Foundation, what are they doing developing drugs? Well, they recognized the important basic biomedical science that would be enabled by these beam lines, and they are OK if other good stuff happens. The second thing is the industry. Is the industry paying their fair share? So DOE thinks a lot about this, and they call them user facilities for a reason. Everybody should have a chance to be a user, but if you are willing to publish in the open literature and make all of your results available, we will give you beam time based on an evaluation of your technical expertise and project goals, and peer review. If your company then wanted to develop and patent some drugs, DOE calculate the full cost recovery and charges you for it in advance. I know that because I am an owner of a biotech company in my outside interest, and we use the synchrotron, and they are very picky about making sure our funds clear before the beam time starts, OK. And they do work very hard to make sure that we are allocating the resources, appropriately that way, and I laud them for that. Ms. Kaptur. Dr. Kasthuri. Dr. Kasthuri. Thank you. I just wanted to respond to one part of your question, Mr. Simpson, which is what do you get out of it or what do appropriators get out of it? And we have had a lot of good slides about the immediate effects and numbers, but I would like to add one more thing, which is that a lot of these big science investments or big science projects wind up inspiring people in ways that is real, but very hard to calculate. And the way I tell the story is that in 1969, 50 years ago, and a few months from now, from today, when we landed on the moon, the average age of a NASA scientist was about 29 years old. I am not sure what the average age is now, but it is older than 29 years old. And that number sticks in my head because in 1962, when President Kennedy announces that we are going to the moon at Rice University, many of those NASA engineers are 22 years old. They are in college or just out of college. And something about this idea of a national effort inspires them. And, I think, there is an argument to be made, was the moonshot a success? When I was young, I looked forward to moon bases when I was an adult and travelling to the moon for holidays. None of which happened. So in one sense, you could imagine that the moonshot was a failure, but in another sense, I suspect that the reason we have satellite technology and telecommunications and many of the things that we have now is because we inspired a generation of students to enter space. And, I think, perhaps, when you think about appropriations, this is something worth thinking about that there are inspirational value that has real benefits to this country that is hard to quantify, but I would argue is very real. Mr. Simpson. Thank you for that. I appreciate that and I agree with you. I guess one of the challenging things is, you know, there is never enough money. You have an appropriation and there is viable needs that need to be appropriated, and what I am trying to figure out is how do I determine whether we have $50 million here, where is our best investment, and how do I determine what we are getting for that investment? And that is the challenge, I think, this committee has. But I do appreciate everything you do and look forward to working with you on these. I yield back. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you, Mr. Simpson. When you look at the additional funds that have been given to the Department, passed by Congress and signed by the President, for fiscal year 2020, and you think about the fields in which you have devoted your lives, trying to communicate to the outside world about a moonshot-type effort, in this field, gets lost. I remember when we had Members from Massachusetts who fought so very hard for Sil Conte, being one of them many, many years ago, for the original work that we did on the BRAIN initiative. And after the first announcement, it kind of goes out there and the road markers are not clarified as it moves forward. Then you have the Human Genome Project, and you hear about that. I think it needs better road signs as we move forward to the extent one can so that people continue to be engaged, Doctor. But even myself, I know how frustrating it is for me trying to express this to an audience. It is a little murky; and we know that as science is developing, obviously, it would be. But then people lose focus. So I just would encourage you to think about that and how one would organize going down this road collaboratively among interested departments and agencies. I think the public would welcome it, but I don't think from a messaging standpoint we necessarily do the best job. So just wanted to put that on the table. Congressman Pocan. Mr. Pocan. Thank You, Madam Chairman. And thank you to the panel very much for being here. Very interesting. Let me try a couple areas if I can get it in my 5 minutes, but one in particular, Dr. Varmus, you mentioned isotopes. In my district, we have a couple companies that were fortunate to get some partnership with the Department of Energy to manufacture the isotope Moly-99 and we were not as successful in getting as much funding for domestic production as we would have liked to. We are hoping to try to make that case this year and I thought maybe you could help me make the case because as we understand the domestic production where this is currently produced has been dwindling. I think the last area was in Canada, on this continent, and that is why they put the grants out a number of years ago. A couple of these now have had successes. Can you just talk a little bit about how important it is for that funding to find the domestic source to be able to produce something like this and what that means other than just a company producing it, but why we need to have domestic production of this type of an isotope? Dr. Varmus. Well, I have to do something that I do not like to do, which is to admit my ignorance about this particular substance. In general, I do think it is good for us to be producing our reagents in this country. It makes access easier and cheaper, but on this particular isotope, I really cannot comment. Maybe my colleagues know something about this. Mr. Chance. I do not. Is this is a diagnostic reagent, Molybdenum-99, for imaging? Mr. Pocan. Yes, exactly. Mr. Chance. Yes. Well, these isotopes, it is a tough market for a small company, right? You know, you have got a few. So, I don't know, the DOE is very good at enabling technology development and companies, but we need these isotopes to see the stuff we need to see and each one has sort of a different niche of imaging that uniquely provides important capabilities. And, you know, your folks at Minnesota and others and Wisconsin are using these isotopes a lot and there are tremendous research centers there. Mr. Pocan. Thank you. I think when you mentioned a few things really hit things out here in the district, you know. People are concerned about autism. You mentioned autism, Alzheimer's, depression, and mental illness, when you talk about other benefits something like, at least 30 percent of the people who are incarcerated are there because they have mental illness, right? Those three areas, please talk about some of what we are seeing in developments and, like, be promising in autism, Alzheimer's, and depression and mental illness. Dr. Kasthuri. Yes, so, broadly, I think in neuroscience there is a lot of progress being made in these fields. Some of it is trying to figure out are there predispositions in your genes, or et cetera, that allow you to get these diseases more easily than other people? That is the first. I think, second, there is a lot of progress in being made about how we diagnose or define these diseases because many of these diseases are not exactly one particular disease, they are a spectrum of diseases, and the better we understand where a patient falls on the spectrum, the better we can treat them. I think these are broadly happening. It is not the work that we do. The work that I am particularly interested in is that for many of the diseases, for example, autism, it is this idea that it is an inappropriate wiring between neurons. Maybe those neurons are making too many connections with each other, not enough connections, and that is the fundamental basis of the disease. And so, while these other advances are happening in the therapy and how we define it and how we diagnose it, we are interested in giving the sort of deep fundamental physical basis. And once we can collect enough data in that world, are there new therapies that we have not thought of because now that we understand the biology at some physical level, and that is what we are hoping for as well. Mr. Pocan. That is true of depression, too, right? Dr. Kasthuri. Absolutely. Mr. Pocan. The connections, because I know that another company in our district got some funding recently for psilocybin research actually trying to do new connections for people with depression and it just seems to keep resurfacing in a lot of our conversations. Dr. Kasthuri. Yes, and I think it will keep resurfacing until we can have a definitive answer on it. And I think the interesting thing about definitive answers is that some things no longer surface that we used to think were relevant and new things now surface that we never thought of. Mr. Pocan. Got you. Great. No, I appreciate, again, we just have with the University of Wisconsin clearly a lot of offshoots working in all these areas and we are fortunate to get a lot of funding with the Office of Science as well and we want to make sure that continues. And I really appreciate your time today. I yield back. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you, Congressman Pocan. Congressman Fleischmann. Mr. Fleischmann. Thank you, Madam Chair. Madam Chair, I want to thank you and the ranking member for having this hearing today. It is educational, it is insightful, and it is optimistic and I appreciate that. Gentlemen, you will find that this subcommittee I would say, like most of the subcommittees, not all on the Appropriations Committee, we work well together whether it is with our national labs. Mr. Foster and I, we have debates about other things, but when it comes to national labs, and he has a distinct scientific edge over me, but I still root for ORNL. But it is truly wonderful the job that you are doing and I think I can speak for the entire subcommittee that we are pleased to fund this research and I am really thoroughly impressed by the discourse today. It seems that there is a wide variety, a wide spectrum of maladies and conditions that we are looking at, and the question that I want to ask, and it is a little bit broad, but I am interested in all three of your perspectives. It seems as we fund this--and, Dr. Varmus, you alluded to it with your earlier research, the genetic basis for cancer, particularly breast cancer. My mother passed of breast cancer when I was very, very young and I am so proud of the strides that we have made to combat that horrific disease. But my general question is for each one of you. Is it genes, is it environment, and/or does it depend on the malady or condition, and how will our funding help narrow those questions and those gaps? Dr. Varmus. Just briefly, it is, of course, conversations both of environments and behaviors as well as genetic inheritance and it does, as you point out, vary from disease to disease. Right now, in the case of the neurological diseases we have been talking about, we probably know more about the impact of behaviors on how those diseases are treated, diagnosed, and evaluated. In the case of cancer, the one place where the Genome Project has made a major contribution that probably is not as well appreciated by the public as it ought to be, to go back to your remarks, Madam Chairwoman, but we know that the diagnoses are based on saying this is a patient with breast cancer who has mutations in the PI 3-kinase gene and the P-53 gene. That makes a difference in deciding what therapies to use because we now have drugs that inhibit the mutant forms of the PI 3-kinase protein. So, that is a major advance and we understand some of the new immunotherapies based on what we know is happening in the genome. Those mutations are in general, not exclusively but in general, not inherited mutations. Those are changes that have occurred because either of the randomness of the mutational process or, in the case of many diseases, by the exposure to certain mutagenic agents. For example, the agents that you inhale when you smoke a cigarette, we know what kinds of changes occur. We can look at the DNA of a patient's cancer and say, this patient was probably exposed to tobacco products, because we can see the signature of those products by our reading of the entire genome present in an individual's cancer. So, the link between genetics and environment becomes very profound and there is no longer a dichotomy between saying I believe in the environmental causes of cancer and I believe in the genetic causes. They are merged in the action of environmental agents on our genome. Mr. Fleischmann. Thank you. Gentlemen. Mr. Chance. So, the answer is your genes or environment can help with your disease progression or they can hurt with your disease and we are learning a little bit about how those are plus or minus risk factors, if you will. But, you know, I don't want to offend Dr. Varmus. It would be bad for my career. Dr. Varmus. I have no influence over your career. Mr. Chance. But we made progress in cancer. I think we made progress in cancer a little bit because cancer is almost like a foreign thing and if we just got rid of it, you know, then the sort of conception is that it would help. But the brain, you know, it is broken in a way and it has to be fixed and he does not agree with me, but that is OK. But the regulation of the cells and the control is directed by genes and environment and we need to get back to--we need to know what a normal set point looks like so then we can know if we have gotten back to it when we get an intervention. Mr. Fleischmann. Thank you. Dr. Kasthuri. It sounds like it is lose-lose whoever I agree with for me, but I will try my own version somewhere in the middle. I think this idea of genes versus environment when it comes to brains is as old as maybe as philosophy. Before we knew about genes it was nature versus nurture and after the discovery of it. And I think it is a very useful exercise to go back and forth to think it is nature or to think it is nurture, but in reality it is probably some complicated loop where nature informs nurture and nurture informs nature. And the problem that biologists have, at least I have, when there is a loop, is that is very hard to describe what causes what in a loop. If A and B are in a loop, did A cause B? Well, B also caused A. And I think that this will only continue to happen, this sort of loop idea and how we talk about causality, the more we appreciate the complicated nature of a complicated organ like the brain. Did I do a good job in between? Mr. Fleischmann. I think we are all in between. And I want to thank the gentlemen and I think it is great sometimes that we can have that difference of opinion. I think that is how we move forward. I think sometimes this body would learn from it as well, but I thank you and I yield back. Ms. Kaptur. Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Thank you, Madam Chair. I will just ask the committee's indulgence because this topic is a tiny bit personal for me. Some of you may know that I am a breast cancer survivor. In December I celebrated my 12th year as a survivor. I was 41 years old when I was diagnosed, and not to really get deep in the weeds on what I went through, when I was diagnosed it was because I found a lump in my breast about 3 months after my first mammogram when I turned 40 years old. And it was kind of miraculous that I found it because it was less than half a centimeter and my mammogram had been clean so there was no reason to suspect that I needed to be looking for anything. I was very fortunate. But I did not find my lump out of luck, I always say. I found it because of the knowledge and awareness that I had that I needed to pay attention to my breast health. However, and thankfully I was diagnosed at Stage 1A, very early breast cancer, but subsequently, when I went through all the processes that you go through when you have a breast cancer diagnosis or any cancer diagnosis, is when I sat with the nurse educator and we went through the whole family tree process of the cancer in my family and I had a lot of cancer in my family, but not really breast cancer. She suggested that because I was young and because I am an Ashkenazi Jew, a Jewish person of Eastern European descent for those of you that do not know what that is, and the amount of cancer I had in both sides of my family, that I may want to have a genetic test. So, then she proceeded to tell me that as an Ashkenazi Jewish woman I was 5 times more likely to have the BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 genetic mutation and that gave me an 85 percent chance of having breast and ovarian cancer and smaller chances of having other kinds of cancer over the course of my lifetime, but particularly before I was 50 years old. Since I already had breast cancer and I had been a State legislator, was immersed in the fight against breast cancer, passed breast cancer legislation in my State legislature, I thought I was pretty knowledgeable about my risk, about people's risk. You know, one out of eight women in our country will get breast cancer at some point in their lifetime, but I did not know that as an Ashkenazi Jewish woman I was that much more likely to carry the gene. And I had the test, went through the process of genetic counseling and all of that and about a month later got the results. And when I opened the door to walk into the doctor's office, there were may too many people in the room for the result to be negative so I didn't really have to open the folder. I knew that I was BRCA positive and I have the BRCA 2 genetic mutation. My question is focused on this. You know, it can be challenging for most people to wrap their minds around the notion of biomedical research and development and people's eyes glaze over when you are talking about oncogenes. And for me and so many others around the world, the work that DOE and NIH do together and separately is very personal. And I always say when I tell my story that if I didn't know as much as I knew about breast cancer about my risk and that awareness, and we have had a lot of awareness that we have all focused on, attending so many breast cancer functions and events. We have an entire month that is dedicated to it. We have a color that has been completely identified with breast cancer. But if I didn't know about my risk, and I can tell you countless, countless, countless women at risk do not know. Can you, all of you, explain how DOE and NIH projects, like the Human Genome Project, for example, and subsequent projects, not only lead to the genetic tests that ultimately allowed me to be able to be more aware of my risk, the reason it was so important that I be aware of that risk, and know that I was diagnosed with that gene? Because of my diagnosis at Stage 1A, my initial course of treatment was to have a lumpectomy and radiation and then I would be done. But because I was able to have the genetic test and knew how much higher risk I was, I had a double mastectomy. I had seven surgeries over the course of a year. I had prophylactic oophorectomy, meaning I had my ovaries removed at 41 years old. I mean, thank God I had all the kids we had planned to have. But if I had gone with the prescribed course of treatment and not been able to get that genetic test, I probably would have been dead or I would have been diagnosed at a much later stage. So, actualizing in a personal and simple way, the incredible result of the research we have been able to do and the unlocking of the human genome, can you talk a little bit about how we can make sure that we have wide public benefit and awareness of the development and incentivization of the technologies that you research while also making sure that scientific discovery is not stifled? You have a lot of work that you are doing that might seem like it has little practical import, but can later lead to world-changing technologies, which has resulted in me being able to sit here to ask you this question. So, thank you, Madam Chair, and I know I went over in my asking of my question and I hope you understand my question. Dr. Varmus. Well, I am not sure I completely understand the question. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. The question really is, very simply, that a lot of this is mumbo jumbo to most people and we spend billions of dollars on this research that is critically important, but the awareness of the BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genetic mutation was out there for many, many years and someone as aware as I was had no idea about my potential risk. Dr. Varmus. No, I mean, you tell a story very powerfully and I sympathize with the things you had to go through. Getting information of this kind, which is complicated to the public in an efficient and useful manner is difficult. I know from my experience at the NCI and NIH generally and from working. I was the president of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center for 10 years and I know that getting these messages out in a digestible fashion is a problem. One ancillary problem that is not widely appreciated is the scarcity of genetic counselors who specialize in this information. We have genetic counselors who are very abundant in advising you about your pregnancy, but we have not trained a cadre of similar counselors who can provide not just you once you have had your diagnosis, but people who are unaware of the need of what is entailed in having genetic counseling. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Can I just interrupt? I am sorry, Madam Chair. Dr. Varmus. Sure. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. For example, all three of my children are now at risk of carrying the genetic mutation. Dr. Varmus. Absolutely. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. My twins are 20 years old. My youngest daughter is 16. And my oldest daughter has said, well, I am just going to go right away to 23andMe. And, you know, and 23andMe now can tell you whether you carry that genetic mutation. Dr. Varmus. Of course they can. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. But having that information without that genetic advice is really---- Dr. Varmus. Yes, that is a big problem. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. I mean, to find that out at your kitchen table with the entire enormity of what that means is-- we cannot allow that to happen. Dr. Varmus. It is a totally different question when you have had your children and you are willing, your attitude toward the surgical reduction and risk. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Yes. Dr. Varmus. Which that is what you did. You reduced your risk of breast and ovarian cancer nearly entirety. That's right. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Exactly. And if I were younger, getting guidance on should I have my eggs extracted? Dr. Varmus. Right. So, these are the difficulties created by knowledge that we are glad we have because facing facts is what we want to do as a society. But the burdens that we create are significant and we don't have clear answers. And, you know, we like to say that these are decisions that patients have to make for themselves, but they need guidance because the issues are complicated. The risks are not 100 percent, as you pointed out. They are high and they vary from individual to individual depending upon the mutation that you found inherited. Now, you probably--you may have--I am 100 percent Ashkenazi, so I know the story. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Me, too. Dr. Varmus. And if you have the mutations that are characteristic of people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, we probably know a lot about those mutations. But there are also individuals who have fairly novel mutations in these genes. They are discovered when companies like 23andMe or your local genome center, as we have in New York, discovers the mutations and maybe very little known about them because every mutation carries a different risk. So, these are subtleties that we are beginning to appreciate because of the vast amount of work that is being done by DOE and by NIH to look at as many genomes as possible. At the New York Genome Center, where I also work, we are particularly concerned about minority populations. Ashkenazi Jews are also a minority, but there are other minority populations that have not received the same level of scrutiny. And discovering the variance that are inherited that may predispose to risk of cancer or neurological diseases or others will only be appreciated if we include everybody in these genetic analyses that do predict risk of very serious diseases. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Thank you. And, Madam Chair, the investments--and I raise this because the investments that we have to make beyond just in this research so that we can have it result in these discoveries, help women like me and others and minorities that haven't had the application of these technologies applied just yet. The decision I had to make was I could go with the course of treatment based on the diagnosis that I had. But if I did that, then the decision I had to make is: have an MRI every 6 months for the rest of my life and be waiting, constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop. I was in the stage of my life where thankfully, I got married young. We had our children. I had breastfed my children. You know, those were all the decisions that I had to make in a very short period of time because I had cancer. And we need to make sure that we are--there is a lot of results and impact that we have from the discoveries that we make that affect real people and we need to be making investments as appropriators to try to make sure that they can deal with the ramifications of the results of these incredible discoveries. So, I appreciate you indulging me for going over my time. I yield back. Mr. Chance. Can I make a brief comment, Chairwoman Kaptur? Ms. Kaptur. Dr. Chance. Mr. Chance. Mrs. Wasserman Schultz, thank you so much for sharing your story. I think the willingness of people to share stories and patient advocacy has been so important to moving the needle forward. I want to echo Dr. Varmus' comments. We are discovering this stuff. But if there aren't people in the medical system who can explain it to you, patients won't get the benefit. And genetic counseling, we have genetic counseling training programs at Case and around the country, but often reimbursement is a problem. Genetic counseling is not necessarily reimbursable in many plans. As more complicated genetic information comes in, it is going to be a little more expensive and a little more challenging, you know, to bring that information to patients. But those are the professionals in the healthcare system who could really help us. Ms. Kaptur. I just want to say, Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz, you could have as much time as you want and we admire you very much for your courage and your continued service. Congressman Newhouse? Mr. Newhouse. Thank you, Madam Chair and Mr. Simpson, for having this hearing today. It is truly an important subject to discuss. I want to thank Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz for sharing her testimony today and that helps us understand the significance of what you are working on. I will not extrapolate a lot, but this kind of work impacts almost everybody. And let me tell you as someone who held the hand of my first wife as she fought breast cancer, even though you are coming up with new things all the time, let me just tell you, it isn't fast enough when you are in the situation where a loved one is facing something like this. So, anything we can do to accelerate your ability to come up with these things, not just in cancer, but in brain research and all the other disciplines that we are focused on. So, thank you, all of you, for your work. It is the Lord's work and very much we appreciate--as Mr. Fleischmann said, we all support doing as much as we can to further that work. So, I am from the State of Washington. I represent--among my constituents are those that work at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, truly a tremendous institution that does a lot of work in so many different areas. Like Mr. Simpson, I am always amazed at the things that they are working on there and, also, I hate to admit this, but like him, don't always understand what the heck they are doing. But it is great stuff and making tremendous strides in much of that work. So, I am proud of that and I always try to point out what I think is really one of those things that a lot of people even in the Tri-Cities in the State of Washington aren't aware of what is going on right down the road. And so, thanks for giving me a soapbox to talk about that. But as much of the partnership between NIH and the DOE as you had talked about, Dr. Varmus, it has been focusing on the world's computing systems and I think the fastest one happens to be at Oak Ridge if I am not mistaken. Mr. Fleischmann. And the next fastest one coming. Mr. Newhouse. Oh, is that right? OK. But you also talked about other things that DOE and the labs bring to the table. My understanding is that several of the NIH programs look to PNNL for things such as the advanced chemical analysis systems that can be very crucial for understanding the impacts of, say, exercise on their health and, even like Ms. Wasserman Schultz was talking about, helping do early detection of cancer and potential treatment. One thing that struck me as being something. What are some of the areas beyond computing that you see in the DOE facilities and the researchers having an impact on things like cancer or where should we be encouraging that in the future? Dr. Varmus. Well, you are correct, Mr. Newhouse, that all of us have been emphasizing to a very large extent, but not exclusively, the computational power that DOE brings to the table when DOE and NCI undertake things together. Indeed, the cancer initiative I described is largely based on the interface between high-performance computing and certain areas of cancer research. But as we heard and as is manifest frequently, but as we heard during our workshops in putting together a report on NIH-DOE interactions, there are many other areas: material science, developing new ways to fabricate things; nanotechnology, that the creation of very small devices that can be used, for example, in drug delivery or delivery of radioisotopes. Those are areas of research where NIH and DOE are doing things that are similar and benefit from the interaction. You talked about sensors, and sensors can range from sensing exercise regimes to sensing molecules in the bloodstream. I believe Mr. Simpson alluded--or was it Ms. Kaptur-- alluded to devices for detecting head injury. We can now measure DNA that comes from cancer cells in the blood by taking a peripheral blood sample and use that as a guide for whether a treatment actually working. That is a kind of sensor developed largely through NCI and the private sector in this case, but representing the kind of sensitive device for finding just individual--small numbers of molecules that can reveal the function of an important organ or the progress of disease. So, these are all areas and mainly coming from engineering and the physical sciences which has been the strong point for much of DOE-related research, but, as I try to emphasize, has historically been involved in many of the advances we have made in healthcare, from the earliest development of simple x rays by Wilhelm Roentgen over 100 years ago to more modern ways to use magnetic resonance imaging or PET or CAT scanning to diagnose disease early. All these represent efforts to understand the body not just as a living set of cells, but also as a physical entity made up of molecules that are sometimes best approached through physics, chemistry, and engineering. Dr. Kasthuri. I have perhaps a tangential answer. So, about 2, maybe 3 years ago, I had never really heard of the national lab system. I was 100 percent a neuroscientist. I maybe heard of some national labs, but certainly not of the 17 that exist. So, when I first showed up, I was amazed by the technology, the x rays, the computing, the material sciences. But I would like to add one other thing which still surprises me, and I think Dr. Varmus alluded to it earlier. There is s a culture about the national lab system that doesn't exist or exists at a less prominence in academia, and that is that impossible ideas seem common in the national lab system and people there are willing to address things that have a scientific basis and a physical basis. But in other settings, the scale is beyond what people could imagine. And I think this culture, this part of that national lab system is crucial and valuable. It is a place where impossible ideas are routinely considered and that--or where at the moment considered impossible ideas are routinely considered. And there is a different risk versus reward analysis that is happening I think in the national lab and the DOE system that is different for appropriate reasons in the NIH world where the risk versus reward is calculated differently. And I think combining these cultures is going to actually help advance science even if there were no x rays sources or computational sources or material science sources. Mr. Newhouse. I am way over time, but that may give me an opening to ask my second question. But if I were one of your students, I would say, but Dr. Kasthuri, so I was interested in your comments. And I wanted to ask you if you were familiar with the Allen Institute in the State of Washington, their efforts on brain science, that I have just learned a little bit about some of their things that they are working on and like the BRAIN initiative and the potential partnerships with the NIH and DOE to facilitate further scientific discoveries. They have been successful on large-scale transformative neuroscience projects, including just what you mentioned, the mouse connectome as you referred to, that you talked about that. But also I wanted to flag that the institute does provide open access of the data for scientists worldwide free of charge and which has partially been made possible by the congressional funding of the BRAIN initiative. So, I should also point out that the institute has a history of forging collaborative partnerships with other DOE centers of excellence involving neuroscience projects, such as big neuron data analysis, hackathon at Oak Ridge, and I know a lot of the great folks at the institute look forward to more opportunities for comparable partnerships, so with those initiatives. So, just I wanted to bring that up and any thoughts you might have on that as well. Dr. Kasthuri. I should say that the Allen Institute for Brain Science is probably--has some of the premier scientists in the world studying brain mapping, the way we do it. We are at worst frenemies, at best very close colleagues. I cannot imagine the kind of effort at a large scale doing this kind of mapping not including places like the Allen Institute or Janelia Farms, as Dr. Varmus mentioned earlier. These people have great experience in how to do this. And I think if this combination of private institutions, like the Allen Institute and Janelia Farms, mixing with Federal institutions where we will have really great breakthroughs. But in general, both the data they collect and the way they distribute the data for free to the community is kind of a model to emulate. Mr. Newhouse. Thank you very much. And again, thank you all for being here, Dr. Chance, as well. I appreciate your testimony. Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you, Congressman Newhouse. I wanted to ask, the mouse connectome effort, is that finished? Dr. Kasthuri. No, I wish. I think we are just about to start that effort. Ms. Kaptur. Where? Dr. Kasthuri. Not well-known where or how, but I know--in fact, I was just speaking with Dr. Varmus about it this morning. It is an effort that is just literally starting, that people are thinking about how to fund it. What are the various multi-agencies that should be involved in it? Where are the various places that it should be developed and instituted? But I think the effort is actually at the very beginning as opposed to even close to the end. Ms. Kaptur. So, it involves government instrumentalities and several private sector instrumentalities? Dr. Kasthuri. Absolutely, I would suspect it would involve. So, for example, places like the Allen Institute, as Representative Newhouse was saying, places like Janelia Farms, which is a Howard Hughes private institute, like Professor Varmus was talking about, in addition to government agent institutions, DOE labs, and a bunch of academic places together, I think will be how the connectome gets mapped if the genome is any example, which was also a very similar process of mixing private, public, Federal, and academic all together. Ms. Kaptur. I will speak very openly. I think science has trouble communicating with the general public. Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz offered the observation about how she learned and what she knew and what she did not know. I would urge you to consider somehow with--you are scientists. You are not necessarily communicators, though you are the best communicators in your field or you would not be here today, but if you were to look at various months or days that Congress designates for whether it is cancer whether it is mental health awareness, and think a little bit about how you would use those opportunities because members, many members are involved in trying to use those moments to help the people they represent and help the country. I do not think science uses those days very effectively. So, for example, on autism--and I honestly do not remember which day it is that we acknowledge the issue of autism and we try to draw attention to it. The cancer issue is another one. But at that moment, you can get a calendar and you can look ahead and let us say it is June 1, right, at that moment, the best knowledge we have could come here to Washington. We could give you the Gold Room or the Rayburn Room or we could find a room here, a big room, and all of the associations, the Alzheimer's Association, for example, or the National Cancer Society, whatever the individual concern is, we could use that moment and you would have 436 Members of the House plus all of our territories and we could try to help message. But honestly, Members are very busy and they do not keep up on what is happening with the pace of science. So, for example, a Member like myself, I think to myself, OK, so if mental illness is an issue I care deeply about, I know of the Stanley Foundation. But Dr. Ifa Litori, and a lot of what I see on the website, is physical brain presentation. It is not necessarily neurotransmitters. So, the synapses in the middle part of the brain are larger, Doctor, according to at least his research. One of our esteemed Congressmen from Ohio, Mr. Gonzalez, is a former football player and is very involved with Boston University and the Brain Bank they have there. So, I go to the website and I look at trying to help him achieve his goal is, which is healing. In understanding, I am going, is it more physical or is it more embedded in the parts that we cannot see? It is really difficult to be a Member and try to figure out, OK, so where should I be moving this vast ship? And I am even having a little difficulty this morning trying to figure out, respectful of what our jurisdiction is, do we need more advanced light sources? Do we need more large computers? How far along are we on that road? It is hard. I am reading, Dr. Varmus, what you submitted to the record. Do I believe this is all going on and it is already happening so we do not have to worry about it? But it seems like on the communications front, we are not effectively using science to help the American people move forward in this arena. We could. NIH and DOE could think about that, and maybe in 2020 pick one. It could be cancer. It could be autism. It could be bipolar. Whatever it is, how effective could we be in reaching the American public? And at that moment the best scientists we have, the best folks people we have, could come forward, deliver some papers, and talk about the road forward. All I know about Alzheimer--or excuse me, autism, is I looked through a microscope in one lab and it showed that the receptors inside the ear, rather than looking like this for sounds and so forth, looked like this. They are all blunted. I thought, OK. Well, what does that mean? Every Member has that kind of experience. They cannot step away from the particular and figure out, all right, so what do we say to the American people? What do we know and what don't we know? What are these murky areas and we could--what we know. Maybe there are certain things we know. We know that for many neurological conditions, they onset in the teens. What do schoolteachers look for? Many scientists probably know, but we don't communicate it very well. So, I am saying to you, maybe if you could draw from your work in cancer, your work with light imaging, wouldn't it be great to tell the American people that we have to have a machine 10 times more powerful than this or we need more computer scientists that will major in whatever to solve this. I do not think we picked the essential out of what we already know to help direct thinking of the public and Members as a result. Dr. Varmus? Dr. Varmus. Thank you for bringing up this important issue. I think many scientists, myself included, have been worried about this for a very long time. For over 25 years, I have been affiliated, for example, with the Congressional Biomedical Research Caucus, and as you point out, although we put on shows every month, it is hard to get the attention of members. There is so much information. Some of it is solid. Some of it is in progress, hard to know how to present that. Science is not just one entity; it is a lot of different sciences. You have heard that around, even on this small table, what do people want to hear? I think one of the things that I resonated with in your comments just now was the idea that a committee like yours can distill a specific question. That is what is needed, specifically, to promote effective and more productive research between the two agencies. We have this report. It covers a lot of things. There is now 4 years of history since that report was issued. One could imagine having even just a discussion, not even a hearing, in which you say all right, what do you think of the weaknesses? Where can we put our resources to make these collaborations more productive? You know, there are so many things out there, and you heard a lot of ideas, just during our discussion this morning, but I think the pointed question, from appropriators themselves, could be very beneficial. I think a lot of us actually have spent a lot of time trying to communicate with the public. The public is a large, diverse beast, with a lot of different levels of competence, and there is a lot to say, and being told by you, the appropriators. What specific questions you would like answered, I think, is something that would go a long way to improving the interchange between scientists and you as representatives of the public. Ms. Kaptur. Would a discussion, Dr. Varmus, more of an informal discussion between DOE and NIH be a valuable--taking your recommendations from the hearing this morning, would that be valuable? Dr. Varmus. I think that is actually--the discussion is between leaders and the agencies. It is already occurring at a very high level. I was very gratified in my conversations with Chris Fall, the Director of the Office of Science, Francis Collins, and with others, NIH, who are running these collaborative efforts. There are a lot of discussions occurring. I think what is maybe missing in the mix is having interested staff from--especially from the Appropriations side, say we would like to hear from both of you in the room. So, what can we, as appropriators, do to make these connections work better? Right now, people are trying to make better use of the money they have and put things together in a sensible way, but I think going, actually talking to people who control the budgets would be a very useful exercise. Ms. Kaptur. All right. Mr. Chance. Can I say something? Ms. Kaptur. Yes, Dr. Chance. Mr. Chance. Thank you, Chairwoman Kaptur. I really accept a lot of what you say. I accept, from Mr. Fleischmann, we are not moving fast enough. I accept your admonition that we do not communicate well enough, and I accept your challenge to come and make that case and get involved and do more myself. You know, further, I think, if we want to go faster, the beamlines are not fully, you know, utilized. There is spare capacity, and we can go faster, and maybe that would be a cost-efficient way. New beamlines take a while, and, so, those cannot help immediately, but we could get more scientists embedded with the DOE. I mean, that is my secret sauce of what we have been able to do. Take university scientists and embed them with the DOE scientists, and, so, those stakeholders are bringing talent, money, and all of their resources to bear, to sit on that baseline, which you so generously appropriate. Thank you. Ms. Kaptur. Dr. Chance, thank you for that statement. Could you write me back for the DNA samples that, I believe, rest somewhere, that Case, or---- Mr. Chance. Yeah, oh, I know quite a bit about that project. We work very closely with her Veterans Affairs hospital. They are a key affiliate. I know Dr. Bonomo, who is on some of those samples, and I will investigate that for you right away. Ms. Kaptur. Why are they useful? I have no idea. Should I know? Mr. Chance. Yes, you should. Ms. Kaptur. So, so, it is an unknown, big question mark. The Boston University Brain Bank, is that valuable, Dr. Kasthuri? Dr. Kasthuri. So, we are collaborating with them now to try to take some of these samples from the Boston University Brain Bank and analyze them. Sorry, these are postmortem samples of people who have either been diagnosed with concussive neuropathies or, et cetera, and H-matched controls, if you will. So, we are working with them, right now, to see if we can use our microscopes to find the physical basis of these different disease. It is just an exploratory work now, but I find these databases and tissue banks extremely valuable because, when they were collected, they were probably for a particular reason. But as our technologies advance, as our microscopes get better, as our genetic analyses gets better, these tissue banks become super valuable for new questions that had--that never been emerged. When they collected the tissue at Boston University, they did not collect it to have someone do superpowered nanoscale electron microscopic imaging of it, but it turns out that we are trying that now, and it is a resource being applied to a new question that no one had ever thought of, which I really like, in this world. Ms. Kaptur. And I know our ranking member talked with Secretary Perry about resources in California. I do not know exactly what exists there, but you probably know and there is interest among members not on this committee. That is a good thing. Mr. Chance. Yes. Ms. Kaptur. We need to use that. I just wanted to say, Dr. Varmus has to leave quickly because of a travel arrangement. Is that correct, Doctor? Dr. Varmus. No, I have to teach at 5:00 in New York, so I need to get on the 1:00 Acela. Ms. Kaptur. Yes. Dr. Varmus. I will make it. Ms. Kaptur. All right. Well, I wanted to thank you all very much on behalf of our committee. We had a great turnout this morning. That shows the deep interest. I hope that as you go back to your respective responsibilities that you will consider the questions this morning, and the possibilities that exist with the additional funding that the ranking member and I tried very hard to get in this recent bill, and how we might move some of the investments at the Department of Energy forward, whether it is in light imaging, whatever you tell us, to help you to move your research forward faster, in collaboration between agencies and departments and outside interests. I hope that you use this as an open door. And I took your recommendation, Dr. Varmus, and we will try to bring, with your help, together some of those who should be around the same table, as we decide what is an appropriate role for the Department of Energy, what is an appropriate role for NIH, what is an appropriate role, frankly, for defense medicine, and for the research that occurs at the Department of Veterans Affairs. I do not view that research as everybody being in their own car, for heaven's sake, but we need to be on the same train car. We need to be working together here, and we have to break down some of the stovepipes that inhibit faster progress on scientific inquiry. So, consider this, please think about what you have heard others say and ask, this morning, and give us your thoughts, and we greatly appreciate your testimony, this morning, and your time. Mr. Simpson, do you have any additional comments or questions? Mr. Simpson. No. You better go, if you are going to make the 1 o'clock. Ms. Kaptur. All right. Very good. That concludes this morning's hearing. Again, I would like to thank our witnesses for joining us today, and I ask them to please ensure for the hearing record that questions for the record and any supporting information requested by the subcommittee are delivered in final form to us no later than 3 weeks from the time you receive them. Members who have additional questions for the record will have until the close of business on Friday to provide them to the subcommittee office. This hearing, with our gratitude, is adjourned. [Material submitted for inclusion in the record follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] [GRAPHIC(S) FORMAT] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Thursday, February 27, 2020 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S FISCAL YEAR 2021 BUDGET REQUEST WITNESS HON. DAN BROUILLETTE, SECRETARY, DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Ms. Kaptur. The subcommittee will come to order. I want to thank the Secretary very much for waiting. The floor votes were not our plan, and I know that Ranking Member Simpson and I would have wished to start a half-hour, an hour ago. So we thank you for your patience. Let us begin our first hearing on the fiscal year 2021 Budget Request for the Department of Energy. Thank you, Secretary Brouillette, for being here, and for your patience. Before we get started let me first express my deep disappointment that well over 2 weeks after the budget was released, we only just received the full set of required supporting materials needed to evaluate this request late last evening. Frankly, this delay is unacceptable, and I hope, Mr. Secretary, you can rectify it for this next year. The Department of Energy addresses our Nation's most pressing energy, environmental, and nuclear security challenges through transformative science and technology. With those challenges come opportunity, opportunity to achieve progress for our Nation to sustain life, to grow our economy, and to shore up national security through energy independence, opportunity to meet the imperative of climate change by making energy supplies cleaner and more resilient, opportunity to advance high science to yield innovation, to keep our Nation globally competitive, and last but not least, opportunity to cost-effectively sustain the Nation's nuclear deterrent while simultaneously supporting nuclear nonproliferation. Looking toward fiscal year 2021, however, the Trump administration again proposes to cut the Department of Energy's budget by 8 percent overall, and by an astounding 35 percent in nondefense programs. This will limit America's future by drastically reducing or eliminating programs critical to meeting our future energy needs and assuring our Nation's security. These programs have received broad bipartisan, bicameral support precisely because of the crucial role in undergirding our economy, and preparing us for the futures to come, including the clean energy economy. What we should be doing is supporting programs that create jobs as our Nation transitions to a clean energy future. One need look no further than a recent Bureau of Labor Statistics reporting project, that the fastest-growing occupation in the country over the next 10 years, are you ready, is solar installation, to know that these programs are job creators. But, unfortunately, once again the President's budget request harms America's energy future, our competitiveness, our workforce, our environment, our consumers, and our economy. This request is riddled with backward-looking proposals. First, on energy efficiency and renewable energy funding is cut by 74 percent. EERE is responsible for creating and sustaining American leadership, mastering U.S. energy independence and transitioning to a global, clean energy economy. The Trump budget again eliminates the weatherization program, so pivotal to achieving energy conservation for existing structures, and helping lower-income families and individuals reduce their energy costs. Also on the Advanced Research Project Agency-Energy, which invests in transformational energy technologies of the future, is eliminated in your budget despite its track record of success. This backward slide is a nonstarter for this subcommittee. Next, the Office of Science is cut by $1.2 billion. Under this request, research in vital areas such as advanced computing, biology and environmental sciences, chemistry and materials research will suffer. All spur innovation and keep our Nation globally competitive in an often predatory global marketplace. The administration has once again proposed a nuclear weapons budget that has not established clear priorities with a responsible plan to fund and execute them. Instead, this budget suggests that everything is a priority. The proposal includes an increase of $3.1 billion just for Weapons Activities. Mr. Secretary, media reports have indicated that you and even the President's own Office of Management and Budget harbored concerns about the size of this request, which is billions above what the Department projected it would need just last year. While sustaining the nuclear deterrent is a national priority, it must be done in a cost-effective, responsible manner. I must also express serious concern with your request to again cut key nuclear nonproliferation programs. With that, I close my remarks. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, again, for being here today, and we look forward to discussing this request and adapting it accordingly. I would like to turn to our ranking member, Mr. Simpson, for his opening remarks. [The prepared statement of Ms. Kaptur follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT TIFF FORMAT] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Simpson. Thank you, Chairwoman Kaptur. I am pleased to join you in kicking off another series of budget hearings. I would like to welcome Secretary Brouillette. I believe today is not only his first hearing with our subcommittee, but also his first hearing as Secretary. Mr. Secretary, I look forward to hearing from you today on the fiscal year 2021 budget request, and learning more about how it reflects your priorities for the Department of Energy. As members of this subcommittee well know, the Department of Energy is critical both to the national security and economic competitiveness of the United States. A credible nuclear deterrent is essential for our own national security and for the security of allies around the globe. The Department of Energy, through the National Nuclear Security Administration, is responsible for maintaining a safe, secure, reliable, and effective nuclear weapon stockpile, and addressing nuclear proliferation threats that continue to change in a changing global landscape. The Department also supports a strong nuclear Navy which is also necessary. The fiscal year 2021 budget request strongly supports these national security responsibilities. While it is our job as legislators to ask questions, to make sure funds will be used wisely, and that programs will be successful, I believe these defense activities must remain a high priority for this committee. Our country's economic competitiveness is driven in part by our ability to continue as a global leader in energy production and energy technology innovation. These, in turn, rest on the basic science and applied energy research and development programs in the Department of Energy. The budget request proposes funding primarily for early-stage research, and, therefore, is not as robust as last year's enacted levels. I think Congress has made its position clear over the past several years that some amount of funding for all stages of research is important. I look forward to continuing our discussions on how to make the best targeted investments in these areas. Perhaps just as important as any particular funding level is actually getting the Department of Energy's budget, a final budget, in a timely manner. Our budget caps--levels are set for this year, so I am hopeful that we can work together, Republicans and Democrats, House and Senate, and the administration, to enact a fiscal year 2021 Energy and Water appropriation bill by the start of the new fiscal year, kind of a novel concept. Secretary Brouillette, I appreciate you being here today to explain your budget request. I know my colleagues and I look forward to working with you to move forward a budget that will strengthen our national security and advance our energy independence. I thank Chairwoman Kaptur for calling this hearing. I yield back. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you, Mr. Simpson, very much. And before we turn to Secretary Brouillette, I want to remind our Members that after we hear from the Secretary and begin questions, for those Members present in the room, when I gaveled in at the beginning of the hearing, I will recognize you for questions in order of seniority, alternating between majority and minority, until all who arrived prior to the gavel have asked questions. For those who arrived after the hearing has started, I will recognize those Members solely in their order of arrival, again, alternative between majority and minority. And I want to thank the Members for their tremendous turnout today. We will now turn to our witness, Secretary Dan Brouillette of the Department of Energy. Secretary Brouillette is the 15th Secretary of Energy, and he was most recently the Deputy Secretary at the Department. He previously worked on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and has worked for the industry and as a state energy regulator. Also, he has spent a great deal of time in the automotive industry. We thank you for taking the time to be here today. Without objection your written statement will be entered into the record. Please feel free to summarize your remarks in about 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF SECRETARY DAN BROUILLETTE Secretary Brouillette. Chairwoman Kaptur, Ranking Member Simpson, and members of the subcommittee, it is indeed an honor for me to appear before you today to discuss President Trump's fiscal year 2021 budget request for the Department of Energy. And Madam Chair, your comments regarding the CJs are very important to me. I want to apologize to you for not getting that in on time. You have my personal commitment that that will not happen in the future. The members of this committee, on both sides of the aisle, have been very strong partners to the Department over the past 3 years, and I am grateful for the support that each of you have given me as Deputy Secretary. And it is indeed a privilege for me to appear before you today as the 15th Secretary of Energy. My interest in the national security work of the Department began during my service as a tank commander in the United States Army. My time on the Hill, working in this very building for a member office, and later as chief of staff to the House Energy and Commerce Committee furthered my passion for the mission of DOE. Having led the Department's Congressional Affairs office, and most recently serving as Deputy Secretary, I am humbled. And I look forward to continuing to work closely with each of you in this new role. The President's fiscal year 2021 budget request promotes energy independence, it advances scientific research, it strengthens U.S. energy security, and it enhances the protection of our Nation's security. The budget supports the development of reliable and affordable energy with strategic investments in research and development, critical infrastructure, and cross-cutting initiatives such as energy storage, including the next generation of batteries that integrate renewable energy more efficiently into the grid. In 2020, for the first time in my lifetime, the United States will be a net energy exporter, and the world's number one producer of oil and gas. Notably, the United States is also the world's second-highest generator of wind and solar energy, and the world leader in carbon emissions reductions. I am confident that the initiatives in this budget will advance and extend those gains for years to come. The Trump administration believes it is imperative that America maintains dominance in science and technology, especially with global competitors like China racing to surpass us in critical scientific capabilities. That is the underpinning of this year's budget request of $5.9 billion for scientific innovation across the DOE complex. The request also supports substantial investment in areas the President has designated as industries of the future, including supercomputing, artificial intelligence, quantum, and advanced manufacturing. The budget again prioritizes the development of next- generation advanced nuclear technology. As we strive to regain American leadership in nuclear energy, this administration realizes the need for domestically produced uranium, and in doing so, this budget requests $150 million for a new DOE program, for a strategic stockpile of U.S.-origin uranium to protect against market uncertainties, recognizing the value of American nuclear energy and national security interest. This is the first step in a soon-to-be-released broader strategy endorsed by the President's Nuclear Fuel Working Group. The budget requests $27 billion to support DOE's mission for national security. Given the current geopolitical environment and increasingly capable rivals, the U.S. must have nuclear capabilities to meet current and future national security challenges, and key to this effort is sustaining the current stockpile of nuclear weapons, modernizing our nuclear forces, and recapitalizing its infrastructure. The request also funds continuation of cleanup sites associated with nuclear weapons development production and government-sponsored nuclear energy research. The administration believes progress on managing the Nation's spent nuclear fuel is critical, and that the standstill on this important issue has gone on for too long. Notably, the fiscal year 2021 budget does not request funding for Yucca Mountain licensing. Instead, we seek to prioritize research development and the evaluation of alterative technologies and pathways for the storage, the transportation, and disposal of the Nation's nuclear spent fuel. The men and women I have the privilege to lead are extremely dedicated to the DOE mission. Working with Congress and their industry partners, I am very proud of the Department's accomplishments over the last 3 years to advance American energy, promote scientific innovation, and to protect America. The results are significant for the United States as a nation and for taxpayers. And finally, I want to thank the committee for the strong support in the fiscal year 2020 appropriation, and the full- year appropriation for fiscal year 2019. The certainty provided the Department by both is appreciated. And we are seeking that same certainty this year. I look forward to working each of you to that end. Thank you very much for the opportunity to appear before you. And I look forward to your questions. [The prepared statement of Secretary Brouillette follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT IN TIFF FORMAT] Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. We will begin questions now. The first one concerns research and development at the Department. Your budget, Mr. Secretary, cuts the Office of Science by 17 percent, and the energy research and development programs by 59 percent. While the United States currently leads in research and development, China is expected to surpass the United States in the next year or two. That substantial public spending from China helps explain why it was the world's largest market for energy investment in 2018. And looking at U.S. clean energy research spending relative to the size of the economy, we rank No. 10 compared to other countries around the world. We surely must sustain investments in innovation to maintain U.S. edge and competitiveness in the future. Mr. Secretary, how do you justify these drastic cuts to the science and energy research and development programs at a time when China and other countries are investing, literally, trillions in innovative energy technologies? Secretary Brouillette. Madam Chair, thank you for the question. It is important that we maintain parity with adversaries and nations, frankly, who have other interests in mind, and it is certainly not our interest at heart. What we have done in this budget is, I think the ranking member has alluded to and I will elaborate on, is that we have moved some of the research from basic science research--excuse me, from applied research to basic science research. What we have noticed in some of the programs within DOE is that we are focusing on technologies that are now mature, now available to the marketplace, widely available I should say. And it is important that we look to the next generation of science, the next generation of these energy technologies that you mentioned in your opening statement. You and I had a quick conversation and I think it is an important--it is important for us to look to universities like the University of Toledo, who is working on, for instance, perovskite as the next generation of solar technology. So our goal is to leapfrog what we are doing today, and to look to those types of technologies and move them to the marketplace as soon as we possibly can. It has been said before that things like solar energy are now focused on photovoltaics, which in many respects can be almost akin to a horse and buggy. Anyone, anyone can obtain a solar panel. The initial investments in solar were critical, but it is the next generation of solar that we need to bring online. That is our intent and we want to focus our efforts on those types of things, and it simply means that we are going to move or we are requesting to move some of the money from the applied sciences over to the basic sciences. Ms. Kaptur. Well, Mr. Secretary, I heard your answer, and I think our committee will eventually work its will, but we want to develop both the basic research and the applied research. And we hope the Department of Energy is building itself to become a showcase for the invention of the future that is happening as we speak today. Secretary Brouillette. I would love that. Ms. Kaptur. I will reserve some of my other questions, and we will turn to my colleagues, and to our very able ranking member, Mr. Simpson. Mr. Simpson. Thank you. You mentioned during your statement that there is no money requested for Yucca Mountain. I understand that. The budget request includes funding for interim storage. As you know, current law has some limits on authorized activities and sources of funding for those activities. Do you expect to execute the requested funding under current law, or do you anticipate the administration submitting a legislative proposal? And if you do, when would that be coming up? What is the timing of it? Do you know? Secretary Brouillette. Well, sir, with regard to our legislative proposal, I don't anticipate sending anything to the Hill in the near term. The current law, as drafted, prohibits us from pursuing Yucca Mountain, so it is the position of the administration that we will not pursue Yucca Mountain at this time. What we would seek to do is to look for alternatives. There are provisions in current law that allow us to do research and development on perhaps interim storage options. We don't need legislative authority to do that; it already exists in the current law under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. So, it would be our intention to work with you, to work with state policymakers, to work with local policymakers, to start to begin the process to identify potential alternatives to address an issue that has been with us for quite some time. Mr. Simpson. Do you anticipate trying to use any of the money from the Nuclear Waste Fund for those activities? Secretary Brouillette. No, sir. Mr. Simpson. You mentioned uranium reserve in your opening statement that we are establishing this to be on guard against market disruptions, and support strategic U.S. fuel cycle capabilities. We haven't seen a lot of detail on this proposal yet, but we have been told that this proposal is consistent with the priorities of the administration's Nuclear Fuel Working Group. Can you please provide any additional information on when we will see the working group recommendations, and how this proposal fits into the larger context, including the need for uranium reserve? Secretary Brouillette. Yes, sir. So to take a step back, what we have noticed in the marketplace with regard to uranium is we have seen nation states dominate this marketplace over the course of the last 5, 10 years, perhaps 1 or 2 decades. The United States, in our view, has lost its leadership position with regard to the nuclear industry, and it is our view that it is very important that we regain it. What this represents or what the request represents, the $150 million that we are requesting from Congress is the first step in what will be a broader strategy that includes potentially conversion activities with regard to uranium. That working group will release its results early next week. I know that some of the staff here have begun briefings on that. Our current plan is to release that on Monday or Tuesday of next week. And I think what you will see is an overarching plan to take the first step and, perhaps, the next four or five steps to bring the United States back into a leadership position with regard to nuclear energy. Mr. Simpson. As you know, I am a strong supporter of nuclear energy and its role in providing reliable noncarbon power. In fiscal year 2020, Congress made a deliberate decision to move the program's focus from more general research to actually building things, which the public wants see us build things, primarily through the advanced SMR program and the new advanced reactors demonstration program. The budget request for fiscal year 2021 funds both programs but at significantly reduced levels, I assume as part of the broader choice to focus on early research and development. I think this broader policy is an area where Congress and the administration will continue to disagree. So, let us set aside for a moment where the funding comes from. How important do you think it is to successfully demonstrate U.S. advanced nuclear technologies? What kind of impact do you see for the domestic power sector for the U.S. economic competitiveness for nuclear security and for the environment? Secretary Brouillette. It is absolutely critical. It is absolutely critical. As we look to the future of nuclear energy, we see some continued development around the world of major reactors, big reactors, gigawatt-size reactors. Those will happen across the world. Unfortunately, I do not see that happening in the near term here in the United States. But that does not mean the end of nuclear energy as we know it. We are very excited about some of the activities that we see in the small modular reactor space. We were very happy to see companies like NuScale move into phase four of the regulatory process. We want to see them continue that. We are very excited about some of the smaller reactors. Companies like Oklo have developed reactors that are very small in size, 1 megawatt, 2 megawatt, 5 megawatt. Those have enormous capabilities and opportunity available to places in the country like where I grew up, very rural parts of the country where a small modular reactor or a small microreactor can provide energy to a microgrid. And we want to see those technologies move forward. They are smaller; they are cheaper; and importantly, some of the work that we have done at DOE, they are using fuels that are accident-tolerant and walk-away safe in many cases. So, the idea of a Chernobyl, the idea of a meltdown does not exist with some of these smaller reactors. And over time, if we can prove and demonstrate this technology, then, perhaps, some public perceptions around nuclear energy will begin to change. It is important for us for the provision of energy It is important for us to maintain any ability to decarbonize the economy. We must have this type of power coming online. Mr. Simpson. Thank you. I yield back. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you, Mr. Simpson, very much. Congressman Kilmer. Mr. Kilmer. Thanks, Madam Chair, and thanks, Mr. Secretary, for being with us. As we were discussing before the chair started the meeting, my district is home to the only marine lab in the Department of Energy's national lab system, the Pacific Northwest National Lab's Marine Sciences Lab in Sequim, Washington. The Sequim lab is a unique asset. It is a valuable asset both for the DOE and for the local communities that benefit from the economic and educational opportunities that it provides. I actually want to start with just a thanks. Assistant Secretary Simmons and Director Fall visited the Marine Sciences Lab last year to learn about the work being done there to better understand coastal ecosystems and support the Powering the Blue Economy Initiative which is focused on developing new marine renewal energy technologies from Algae-based biofuels to marine hydrokinetic devices that can literally convert ocean waves into energy. The research and technologies being developed at the Marine Sciences Lab will play a critical role in our effort to decarbonize our Nation's energy system. I want to thank the chair and the ranking member and the folks on this committee for recognizing the significance of this work which began as a pilot program in fiscal year 2019. The committee provided $30 million for fiscal year 2020 to continue growing this program. Those funds are specifically intended to build upon the current model and focused efforts led by PNNL's Marine Sciences Lab. So, I want to make sure that DOE has a plan to use those funds for their intended purpose, and I was hoping you could tell the committee how you plan to execute on that funding. Secretary Brouillette. We do have a plan. And let me start by thanking you for your support of that lab, as well and the important support that you have provided to us over the years, not only for this particular activity within the lab, but also for PNNL generally. As you know, it is an important component for us. It is our big data center. It is important to quantum computing capabilities that we have coming online. I thank you for your support of that lab. With regard to the marine lab, we are looking at battery technologies that will involve the use of algae and other types of research, other types of materials I should say. And the research that is being done on that is being done in places like the Marine Sciences Lab. So, it is a very important component of the DOE complex, and I will give you my personal assurance that we will continue to support that lab at the highest levels. Mr. Kilmer. Thank you. As the Secretary of the Department of Energy, you have a critical role to play in assuring that the U.S. remains a global leader in developing the next generation of renewable energies that our Nation and that other countries are going to depend on if we are going to reach that scientifically mandated goal of net zero, economywide net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. And I want to see our Nation become the top manufacturer and exporter of these technologies so that American workers and American communities can benefit from this extraordinary economic opportunity. Recognizing that PNNL and the Nation's 16 other national labs are already playing a key role in the development of advanced renewables, how do you plan to continue that critical work and support America's competitiveness with just 25 percent of your current funding for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, as were requested in this budget? Secretary Brouillette. While I understand the optics, if you will, of reducing a budget, it is very important that we look at the results. What we are focused on is the actual results. What is it that we are producing with this money? For us at the Department of Energy that looks to be along the lines of battery storage. We see that as the next progression, if you will, of the research that we need to study, and that is why at PNNL we announced a grid launch pad. So, what we are going to do there is a grid storage launch pad; and what we are going to do there is develop a facility that is going to allow us to do testing to achieve grid-scale battery storage because that is what is needed to get the renewables online in a much more aggressive and much faster way. Right now, they are an important component of our energy portfolio. Candidly, we need to do more work with AI, to get that integrated into our grid much more effectively because of the intermittency of the power itself. If we can solve the storage question, if we can provide grid-scale storage, battery storage, then you will see these technologies come online much, much quicker. The other thing we are doing is at a different lab, so forgive me for this, but at NREL we are studying the efficiency of these renewable technologies. For instance, windmills, we think they are very simple. They are three blades on a turbine and they turn when the wind blows. It is much more complicated than that. So, we are looking to improve the efficiency of the wind turbines themselves so that we can get these things much more stable in the grid. Mr. Kilmer. Thank you, Madam Chair. I yield back. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much. Congressman Fleischmann. Mr. Fleischmann. Thank you, Madam Chairman. Mr. Secretary, thank you for being here today, and congratulations. Secretary Brouillette. Thank you, sir. Mr. Fleischmann. It was a privilege working with you when you were Deputy Secretary, and I look forward to working with you in this new capacity, and Assistant Secretary Burnison, who has done an exceptional job with congressional relations. We really appreciate this as we work together to do great things for our Nation. As you know, I have the great privilege of representing the people of Oak Ridge, the birthplace of the Manhattan Project, Oak Ridge National Lab, Y-12, the uranium processing facility, which is just doing so well. It was redesigned and has come out of the ground and is just really a tremendous, tremendous facility, and testament to the work done by the contractor there. And then EM, near and dear to my heart, as I am the national co-chair of the EM caucus. Oak Ridge has a lot of work to do, so, it has been a pleasure working with you in all those endeavors. Secretary Brouillette. Thank you, sir. You are very kind to say that. Mr. Fleischmann. Mr. Secretary, I want to start with the SNS Second Target Station. I am very excited about the plans for the construction of the second target station at the Spallation Neutron Source; was happy to support the $37 million to complete the conceptual design in fiscal year 2020's budget. It is going to enable wholly new capabilities to examine the structure and dynamics of materials from polymers to proteins to catalysts. There is already an extensive report outlining the first experiments that will take advantage of the second target station. It is also going to double the capacity of SNS, which is currently oversubscribed by a factor of three. The project is critical to maintaining U.S. leadership in neutron sciences, and I am thankful that the committee provided and that Congress approved the $37 million to complete the conceptual design in fiscal year 2020, and readied the project for CD-1 review and start construction. Mr. Secretary, sir, when do you anticipate making the decision about CD-1 so construction can move forward, sir? Secretary Brouillette. We anticipate making that decision toward the end of this calendar year or, perhaps, the first quarter of next year. Mr. Fleischmann. Thank you. I am going to turn to high- performance computing. I know Exascale computing is a high priority for the Department, as it is for me and this committee. And this committee has very heavily favored this with its funding. And this will help not only DOE science, but energy, but also national security missions, but also will help the Nation's economic and technical competitiveness. Are still things on track to deploy Exascale systems in 2021 as planned, sir? Secretary Brouillette. Yes. Mr. Fleischmann. Would that be with Frontier, sir? Secretary Brouillette. Yes, it would be. Mr. Fleischmann. OK, thank you. On nuclear cleanup, environmental cleanup has been an area where the Department of Energy has had great success recently, including at our site in Oak Ridge. The Office of Environmental Management oversees projects that are being completed ahead of schedule while reducing environmental risks, thus delivering a sound return on investment for the American taxpayer. In Oak Ridge we are nearing completion on the first major cleanup in nearly a decade and starting a next phase of cleanup on the Oak Ridge Reservation. This next phase will pave the way for growth of the critical science and natural security missions. With this track record of sustained success and accelerated risk reduction, sir, can we count on the Department to continue to prioritize environmental cleanup funding at Oak Ridge? Secretary Brouillette. Yes. There is no question about that, sir. The EM program overall is making significant progress all throughout the complex. So, I will give you just a few quick examples. You know, in Hanford--I am sorry, at the INL, sir. I was thinking about Mr. Newhouse over here. Mr. Newhouse. Do not get those two confused. Secretary Brouillette. I will not get those two confused. Mr. Fleischmann. We love them both, but just not as much as Oak Ridge. Secretary Brouillette. Yes, but we have two tank waste. That is what I was thinking about the tank waste, and I am always drawn to Hanford when I mention tank waste, but at INL the IWTU, we are on track, on target for that. And the Savannah River, obviously, the Salt Waste Processing Facility, we are going to start up those two major facilities this year. And, sir, with regard to Oak Ridge the ETTP, we have already--we are going to clean that up this year. We are going to finish that project. We have already received interest from outside parties who are interested in utilizing that particular facility. So, we are excited about that. We are going to continue that progress as we move forward. Mr. Fleischmann. Thank you, sir. Two quick questions. H-A- L-E-U, please tell us why it is important for America to have a fully domestic H-A-L-E-U enrichment capacity? Secretary Brouillette. It is important for the reasons that we talked about earlier with Mr. Simpson. The development of these small microreactors requires a higher enrichment. It requires a higher enriched uranium in order for it to be more efficient. As you make the reactor smaller, the fuel has to be enriched to a higher level. We announced a program last year. We are committed to that program. What we are looking to do is to catalyze the market. We are hopeful that private industry will see this as a market signal by the U.S. Government that we are looking to regain our leadership in the nuclear industry. So, that is the purpose of it, that is why HALEU is important. And as we move forward, we will exit the business once we see the market signal take off. Mr. Fleischmann. Madam Chair, I am beyond my time, but I have one quick question, if I may, on rare earth metals, for a quick response. Ms. Kaptur. Please. Mr. Fleischmann. Thank you, Madam Chair. The President, as Mr. Simpson talked about a uranium reserve for our country, and we appreciate that so much. We understand that there are certain rare earths out there. Will the Department be willing to look at other rare earth metals and minerals in that regard to what would be necessary to protect our interests? Secretary Brouillette. Yes, we are. Those metals are very important for us as we look at this next generation of battery storage. We must have it. We must end our dependency on countries like China who are, literally, adversaries to the United States. Mr. Fleischmann. Thank you, sir. I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you. Congressman Newhouse. Mr. Newhouse. Thank you, Madam Chair. Secretary Brouillette, thank you for being here with us. Let me add my voice of congratulations to your confirmation as Secretary. Secretary Brouillette. Thank you, sir. Mr. Newhouse. I might say that I am guessing you are an inspiration to many of the staffers on this committee to reach the highest position, maybe some of the Members, too. Secretary Brouillette. You trained me well, though. Mr. Newhouse. But, anyway, congratulations to you. Certainly, the Department of Energy, as you know, has a huge footprint in my district in eastern Washington. Looking forward, very much, to partnering and working with you. So, let me just say about the proposed budget that is before us and characterize it in two ways. We have good news, but we also have some bad news, and I will talk about the good news first. You talked about this a little bit already, but as you mentioned, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in my district, certainly one of the crown jewels of the lab system for the Department of Energy, we are very proud of it, all of its research and development efforts. One of the lab's areas of unique expertise is in the grid-scale energy storage, which you already mentioned. That is going to be critical to the electric grid of the future, and so critical to the country's future. I think all of us would agree that a reliable and an affordable energy storage is critical to maintaining a resilient grid as we modernize and bring more renewal sources online, and you addressed that. One critical element of that work is the Grid Storage launchpad facility at the lab. And I am certainly delighted to see such strong support from the administration for that effort in the budget, so, a couple things on that. I would like you to walk us through the administration's thinking on this important effort, why it is such an important priority for the Department and our energy storage goals. Also, how will the grid storage launch pad benefit the greater R&D moonshot goals on energy storage? And also, could you talk about the strategy that you are deploying through the office of electricity funding in this budget, not only for the construction of the facility, but also to ensure that the Department is ready and armed with the requisite equipment and personnel that is going to be needed into the future to be successful? Secretary Brouillette. Great. Thank you for that, sir. This is an absolutely critical facility for us. As I mentioned earlier in the testimony, the adoption of renewable technologies has grown at an enormous clip. I was just handed this morning a report from EIA that says that wind energy for the first time is going to exceed hydroelectric energy in the United States. That is a very important development and we want to see that continue. As the President has mentioned in the past, as former Secretary Perry and I have talked about for some time now, we do believe that energy diversity, diversity of supply, diversity of suppliers is important to our energy security as well as our national security. So, all of these renewable technologies need to come online. In the past what has allowed them to come online is the provision of baseload power. We need to move beyond that. We need to get to what I mentioned earlier is grid-scale battery storage, and that allows people to move even further, perhaps even to one day where we achieve a goal of 100 percent renewables. Who knows? It is not available today; we cannot do it today. We have to have this type of facility in order for us to do the research that is necessary to achieve the battery technologies that we all want to achieve. So, we are going to be fully committed to this. In the budget, you will see we have established a grand challenge around this. We have asked for money, $158 million or so, that is going to go into this initiative. And should you provide it, we will focus specifically on these technologies. With regard to the other work that PNNL is doing, I will just mention quickly, they are not only key to battery storage. As I mentioned earlier, all of our supercomputing efforts, all of our big data efforts are centered at PNNL. Their expertise in this area is absolutely essential. Their expertise in artificial intelligence is absolutely essential if we are to achieve any of our renewable goals anywhere in the country. Mr. Newhouse. Excellent. I look forward to continue working with you and look forward to a second round of questions. Secretary Brouillette. Yes, sir. Thank you. Mr. Newhouse. Thank you. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you. Congresswoman Frankel. Ms. Frankel. Thank you. Thank you for being here, Mr. Secretary. Secretary Brouillette. Thank you, ma'am. Ms. Frankel. Let us see. I want to talk about nuclear weapons and the New START Treaty. The New START Treaty is the final linchpin in the United States-Russian nuclear arms control. If it is not extended, I think it was signed in almost 10 years ago, February 2011. And if it is not extended, the Russian and United States nuclear arsenals will be unconstrained. It is due to expire February 2021. So I have some questions relative to that. Let me just have a drink of water first. Secretary Brouillette. Sure. I may do the same if you don't mind. Ms. Frankel. You, too. It is our Marco Rubio moment. Secretary Brouillette. Perfect. Perfect, perfect. That is so good. Ms. Frankel. I can say that, I am from Florida. Secretary Brouillette. That is so good. Ms. Frankel. OK. Do you, Mr. Secretary, do you know what the current status of the administration's review of the New START Treaty? Secretary Brouillette. Yes, ma'am. We have not yet begun the conversations on New START, but I fully expect that they will start soon. As a member of the National Security Council, we are going to be a part of that conversation and it is my expectation that we will be asked to provide technical advice all along the process. But those conversations have not yet started. Ms. Frankel. Do you have an opinion whether the treaty should be extended or not? Secretary Brouillette. I don't have a personal opinion, ma'am. I will reserve judgment on that, but I am happy to follow up with you. Ms. Frankel. Have you evaluated what would be the potential impacts to our nuclear stockpiles should the New START Treaty not be extended? Secretary Brouillette. I am sorry, ma'am, say that again. Ms. Frankel. Yes, I will say it again. What do you believe are the potential impacts to the nuclear stockpiles should the New START Treaty not be extended? Secretary Brouillette. I think it would depend on what agreements were struck as part of those conversations and who might be a part of them. There has been some conversation about extending the treaty to third parties, perhaps China, others. I think it would depend somewhat on the outcome of those conversations. Ms. Frankel. I think China has a much reduced amount of nuclear weaponry than either Russia or the United States? Secretary Brouillette. That would be fair to say. Ms. Frankel. OK. I just hope that is not an excuse to get out of it. Secretary Brouillette. No. I am not presenting it as an excuse. I would reserve judgment on the actual impacts to our stockpile such that we just need to find out who might be a party to the conversation and a party to the treaty. Ms. Frankel. Thank you. I yield back, Madam. Ms. Kaptur. Congresswoman Kirkpatrick. Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Thank you very much. Arizona has a significant Native American population and Tribal energy needs are especially important to me. And so I really have three questions around the Indian Energy Policy and Programs Office. It was cut by 64 percent and eliminates the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program. How would cutting and eliminating these programs affect Tribes that are pursuing energy security and resilience, particularly those pursuing clean energy? How is DOE working with the Tribes to help them develop their own energy resources and develop clean energy? And what steps is DOE taking to better communicate and work more effectively with Tribes to make sure they are informed about the availability of these Federal energy programs and how to access them? Secretary Brouillette. Thank you for the question, ma'am. I think that last point that you just made is perhaps the most important point that--or the most important focal point that we could have at the Department of Energy. We tend to call it capacity building within the Department. I can't tell you on any given day exactly what that means. What I do know is what I saw when I traveled out and met with the Tribes. And what I saw were people who were completely unaware of the programs that we have at DOE. The reason for the reduction in the amounts or the accounts that you see there is that there are carryover balances that we need to expend. We need to work with the Tribes to, one, help educate them as to the availability of the money, but what I noticed as well is that they need assistance in basic things, like filling out the forms and understanding the process by which the government makes the decisions. And I want to work more closely with the Tribes to do exactly that. While it sounds basic, it is critically important that we do that. I don't know exactly what each Tribe needs. What I saw was some pretty advanced things. I was up in Alaska not that long ago with Senator Murkowski. She invited me up and we flew out to some very remote locations. And I was, on the one hand, dismayed to see that they didn't realize that we had assistance available to them. I must say that, on the other hand, I was stunned by some of the conversations I had. They were speaking about things like hydrogen energy. I mean, we were in parts of Alaska where literally Amazon has never been heard of much less delivered. They just don't go. But yet, here was a small Tribe talking about how do we get to hydrogen, how do we get to this advanced type of energy? And I want us to be there to help them do that. I think it is very important that we do. Mrs. Kirkpatrick. There is a special interest in the Arizona Tribes in alternative energy, using wind and solar and that is a real opportunity. A lot of these communities don't have access to the grid and so if they can produce energy internally, in their communities, that is more easily distributed. Do you have any sense of how you are involved in any of that local development of those alternative energy sources? Secretary Brouillette. Sure. Not only on the development of the production of the energy itself through wind and solar technologies, which obviously in Arizona you are blessed with, you have plenty of. What we are looking to do is to advance the research and development on microgrids. How do microgrids work? How do they remain stable? How do you maintain the frequency and the requirements that you need to keep the grid stable in such a small environment with an intermittent production of energy? Those are the advances that we need to make very quickly so that these Indian reservations, as well as other parts of the country that are just in remote locations, have access to. So that is our commitment. That is what we want to work on. That is our request to you for funding is focused on those types of activities. Mrs. Kirkpatrick. And what is the actual footprint of the microgrids? Secretary Brouillette. It depends on what you want to do. I mean, you could have as many as 1,000 homes or 2,000 homes or you could have it as small as 3 or 4. You could scale it up and down. Mrs. Kirkpatrick. So that is one of the advantages is that you have flexibility to address the needs of the community. Secretary Brouillette. You do. You can scale it up or down, but the key for us is understanding how to maintain the stability of the grid itself. You have to have so much energy on the grid for it to function all throughout the grid. And it is more challenging than it may appear on first blush, but that is our focus. Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Thank you for answering my questions. Thank you, Madam Chair, I yield back. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you. Congressman Pocan. Mr. Pocan. Thank you, Madam Chairman, and thank you, Mr. Secretary, for being here. Secretary Brouillette. Thank you, sir. Mr. Pocan. And I just want to say you are the second cabinet secretary today for a couple of us. I couldn't get answers to yes and no questions earlier, but your clarity, knowledge, and expertise when giving answers is leaps and bounds above what we had this morning. Thank you so very much. Really, you have brought me some reassurance back. A couple things. Let me say just to start I want to thank you, for one, the support for Moly-99. We really appreciate that. As you know there are a couple companies that have been working on that within my district. You put the grants out; this has been tremendously helpful. Secretary Brouillette. You are kind to say that, thank you. Mr. Pocan. And we know that also there are some cooperative agreements that were previously put out and funded in fiscal year 2020 that are currently being awarded. We look forward to seeing that outcome as well. But I just want to say thank you on that front. Secretary Brouillette. You are kind to say that and I want to give you my personal assurance that we are going to continue to move that along. You may be aware that I just recently made a decision. Under the law I was allowed to extend the band, if you will, for HEU for a short amount of time. I was allowed to do that for up to 6 years. I chose to move it much shorter than that, 2 years, because I want to see the companies in your district and other parts around the world come up and produce this important isotype with LEU. I think that is a critical step forward for us for our nonpro, but as well as just servicing the market itself. So thank you for your support of that program and I look forward to working with you. Mr. Pocan. No, appreciate it. Thank you. Also, University of Wisconsin Madison is in my district. A lot of money comes in through the Department of Energy---- Secretary Brouillette. Outstanding university. Mr. Pocan. Thank you very much. Go Badgers. And our chair went to the University of Wisconsin Madison as well, so we like to give them extra credit---- Secretary Brouillette. LSU is still the national champion so. We will put it right there. Just for the record. Ms. Kaptur. Just to interject, when I was there, they didn't win a game. If anything, it has improved so much. Mr. Pocan. Yes. A very quick aside. She came to an alumni program here in town and sang a song that everyone was shocked that she knew the words to and people who were current staff there didn't and so she is a true Badger and we appreciate it. So, but a lot of money comes in. We appreciate that. I think it is $87.6 million in federally funded energy research in the 2018, 2019 academic year. One concern, though, that the budget does have a $1.2 billion cut to the Office of Science. A lot of that funding not only comes to my university, but 300 academic institutions and others around the country. Can you address that issue for me? Secretary Brouillette. It is a legitimate question and concern. I appreciate it. I want to assure you that many of our cross-cutting activities throughout the Department, however, involve universities like the University of Wisconsin. I was just with Paul Dabbar, who is our undersecretary of science, and we were talking about some of the projects that I know that they will be engaged in, things like quantum computing. Paul has been instrumental in creating a quantum entangled internet, a loop that now goes between Argonne, Fermi, and the University of Chicago. The University of Wisconsin has indicated interest in joining that and we would like them to be a part of that. So we will work closely with them. But while the absolute numbers look like they have been reduced, the cross-cutting efforts throughout the Department ensure that those types of important programs are going to move forward. Mr. Pocan. I just wanted to express that because that is obviously still a concern. A separate issue, but I think a big concern for someone like me, is the huge increase, usually you don't get complaints about increases in spending, but, unfortunately, the huge increase for Weapons Activities is $2.8 billion above what we were told last year was planned for this year's request. It is a 48 percent increase above what the agency planned to request during the Obama administration. I don't know if this is the time, at a time of peace, that nuclear weapons proliferation is necessarily the best idea. This is a giant increase in dollars. Can you give me some clarity on that? Secretary Brouillette. Sure. It is not our intention obviously to start an arms race with anyone in the world. That is not the intent. But within the NNSA, within the weapons complex itself, many of the infrastructure projects have been delayed for years and we are dealing with infrastructure that now dates back to the 1940s. The Manhattan Project was started at Oak Ridge, as Mr. Fleischman mentioned earlier. Many of those same buildings are still in use. So what we have decided to do is to ask Congress for an additional amount of money and front load some of these infrastructure investment so that we can repair these facilities and keep the country safe, keep the country in a posture that provides us with a nuclear deterrent. But it is not our intention at all to begin an arms race with anyone. Mr. Pocan. And I think because I have 20 seconds left I will submit something for the record. Also just a concern that we are developing a new nuclear warhead technology at a time, again, I am not happy that we have had a 20 percent increase in the last 3 years in defense spending period in this county, but now especially around nuclear weapons it is a huge concern, but I will submit that for the record. Secretary Brouillette. Yes, sir. Mr. Pocan. And thank you very much for your comments. Secretary Brouillette. Thank you. I would be happy to take that for the record. Mr. Pocan. I yield back. Sure, thank you. I yield back, Madam Chair. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you. Congresswoman Wassermann Schultz. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Secretary, welcome. Since the SEC was invoked I will give you a hearty go Gators. Secretary Brouillette. I respect that. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. I will avoid chomping in the middle of the hearing. Secretary Brouillette. I respect that. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. But also go SEC. Mr. Secretary, I want to follow up on what my colleague, Mr. Pocan, asked you about because I am very concerned over the recently publicized battle which you appear to have not mentioned or downplayed in your response to Mr. Pocan. But there was quite a bit of publicity around the battle within the administration over NNSA's budget request. So clearly we have to have a credible, reliable nuclear deterrent. We have to do that cost effectively and responsibly and I can appreciate your answer to Mr. Pocan. But this request does not reflect that. The $19.8 billion in total that you are requesting for NNSA is a whopping $3.1 billion above the enacted and billions more than you projected to need just last year. So I am confused and I clearly speak for a few of us at least on the subcommittee when I say that it is difficult to see why we should have any confidence in this request because according to media reports, you supported the lower funding level for NNSA. So why were you comfortable with this lower amount and would the Department still have met its requirements at that amount had that been what was put forward? Secretary Brouillette. Well, I think it is important to take a step back and realize I saw the public numbers as well. I did not in any respect cut the NNSA. So while the number that we had talked about internally was smaller perhaps than what was ultimately presented to the Congress, that still represented a significant increase over the authorization from the year prior, the NDAA in the year prior, as well as the appropriation that was given to NNSA. One of the functions of the chief operating officer, if you will, the Deputy Secretary, which is where I spent most of my time in the Department, is to look for efficiencies and to look not only at the top line of these budgets, but the bottom line as well. We had this very respectful and very appropriate back and forth within the Department itself. Ultimately, however, the President gets to decide what he will submit to Congress and the President made a determination that he wanted to with the higher number because it allowed us to pull forward, as I had mentioned earlier, some of these infrastructure projects. And in order to do that, we needed more money. I think it is an appropriate process that we have within the Executive Branch with OMB and we came to the conclusion-- Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Let me just make sure I have time to ask my follow-up questions. Secretary Brouillette. OK, sure. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. I appreciate your response. Secretary Brouillette. Sure, sure. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. The drama that was depicted with the President's ultimate decision clearly seems to have gone outside the normal process for how the numbers would be arrived at that would actually be requested. Why were the projections about what would be needed in future years so wrong or were they not wrong and is it just that the President interfered with and overrode the normal process that occurs in the budget request process? And how can we have confidence that this request and its projections are accurate and not just randomly selected by the President of the United States? Secretary Brouillette. No, the numbers were not wrong. It is just a matter of establishing the priorities. And as I said earlier, the process was usual and customary. I mean, it is not uncommon to have debate as I am sure you have in this committee from time to time amongst yourselves as to what the appropriate levels of funding are. But the President does get to decide at the end of the day what he will request of Congress and he came to the conclusion that he wanted to move forward with these projects, so we adopted the bigger number and send that to Congress. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Before my time expires, I just want to clarify. So the way the number was arrived at that was in your request, went through the completely normal process and there was nothing unusual compared to any other fiscal year about the way the number that you have asked for in the budget request was arrived at? Secretary Brouillette. I can't really speak to prior years, but the conversation with OMB, the process that we used internally at looking at line item by line item at these projects, that all appeared to me to be normal. And as I said, the President at the end of the day gets to make the ultimate decision. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. OK. And lastly, I want to touch on something else related to NNSA. What recommendations would you provide to Congress for where NNSA should be housed within the Federal Government? Should it remain at DOE, should it be made completely autonomous, or, and I don't support this last option, should it be housed within DOD? Secretary Brouillette. That is an important question that has been around. I was either blessed or cursed to be around as a young staffer on the Energy and Commerce Committee when some of these decisions were thought of back 20 years ago. It is my personal view that I think it is appropriately housed in the manner in which it is housed at DOE. Civilian control of the nuclear weapons complex in my personal view is very, very important. So I would not support a move to DOD. With regard to its independent status, I do not think that is the appropriate answer as well. I think it is very important that these agencies have cabinet level accountability as well as oversight, so I think it is appropriately housed within the Department of Energy today. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Thank you, Madam Chair, I yield back. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you, Congresswoman, very much. Mr. Secretary, your request includes $27\\1/2\\ million to fund interim storage for nuclear waste and oversight of the Nuclear Waste Fund itself. When announcing that the request would not include funding for Yucca Mountain, the President tweeted and I quote, ``My administration is committed to exploring innovative approaches.'' What specific actions is the Department proposing in this request to support innovative approaches to storing nuclear waste? And how are these proposed activities different than activities that have been carried out with funds previously provided by Congress over the last several years? And will the Department move forward with siting or licensing activities for an interim storage facility? Secretary Brouillette. With regard to the last question, the answer is no. We are not going to proceed with licensing of Yucca Mountain, and we won't proceed with licensing of an interim Federal facility. Ms. Kaptur. You will not? Secretary Brouillette. No, we can't. My understanding under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act we are prohibited from starting construction on an interim facility, a Federal facility. So, we will not pursue that. What we are intending to do with the $27 million is to, one, maintain our fiduciary responsibility for the Yucca Mountain site in the State of Nevada. We do need to protect the site. We do need to meet the environmental requirements that are established both at the state and Federal level. My simple point is that we can't walk away from it. We can't simply walk away from it because we have a fiduciary obligation to maintain it. It is Federal property. So, some of that money will be used as we refer to as guns, gates, and guards to maintain oversight of the facility. The rest of the money we would propose to begin development of options and look at alternatives for interim storage. So, it is the initial planning of a potential Federal site at some point in the future. But that preliminary work would be what we intend to use the $27\\1/2\\ million for. Ms. Kaptur. So, you are saying that you can't even begin to identify sites, or you are unwilling to begin to identify sites and licensing? That you are prohibited in doing so? Secretary Brouillette. My understanding of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act is that we cannot take title to spent nuclear fuel without the Yucca Mountain Project moving forward. Progress must be made on Yucca Mountain in order for us to move forward and put a shovel in the ground and begin the development of an interim facility. The law does not prohibit us, is my understanding, to develop options to look forward, perhaps, to that day. And that is what we intend to do withthe $27\\1/2\\ million. Ms. Kaptur. So, give us a little more detail on that as you proceed forward on this. I think there is some measured support on the subcommittee for interim solutions, so--and in the Senate as well. So, what might we expect? Secretary Brouillette. Well, it is a bit premature, a bit early. My intention would be to work with you. It would be to work with other policymakers, perhaps at the state level or Federal level, certainly, with our national laboratories, and collectively come up with some of the answers that I think you are seeking. But at this point in time, we have not even begun the process. We will wait for approval from Congress to begin that. Ms. Kaptur. All right. Mr. Secretary, I have long said we must have a credible, reliable nuclear deterrent, but we must do so cost-effectively and responsibly. This budget request, in my opinion, does neither. And I am concerned that this is simply sprinting toward a cliff or toward failure. What I mean is that the nuclear weapons complex is at capacity from both a workforce and a manufacturing perspective. We have heard this from so many sources, from our past NNSA administrators, for one. And we even heard, recently, from Admiral Richard of STRATCOM that NNSA can only absorb so much work at one time. Yet, this budget request includes a $3.1 billion increase, continuing to put more pressure on a system that already is laboring hard. This is both a question of funding and capacity at NNSA as it continues to modernize. So, if everything is a priority, maybe nothing is a priority. And will you commit to working with us to prioritize this budget request, including options to rebalance NNSA's unrealistic and risky workload, to do something that is more manageable while meeting defense needs? Secretary Brouillette. Madam Chair, I will always work with the committee to do exactly that. We have put forward a request that we think meets the needs of NNSA. You are absolutely correct, the agency is being asked to do a lot. Part of what we would like to do, as I mentioned earlier, the expansion of infrastructure is key. That is part of our capacity problem. The other part of our capacity problem is what you and I discussed prior to the hearing beginning. It is the development of talent. It is the recruitment of talent. It is bringing in the right scientists. It is bringing in people from the right STEM fields. It is getting them into our processes really early, really fast. That is all part of our request, of that $19.8 billion. Ms. Kaptur. Has the Department done any analysis looking at the current workload and options to give NNSA more breathing room? Secretary Brouillette. I think that is an ongoing process. It is something that we do literally every day. That is why we rely on many of our contractors and they tend to be very flexible. They tend to be very adaptable to the mission, as well as our needs. But it is an ongoing process within, not only the NNSA, but the Department of Energy writ large. Ms. Kaptur. Can you share that ongoing process with us and any analysis you might be doing internally? Secretary Brouillette. Sure, I would be happy to do that with you. I would be happy to do that. I am happy to make myself available to you or your staff and come back and give you a very detailed briefing on it. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much. Mr. Simpson. Mr. Simpson. First, just a comment. It would seem to me-- you don't have to respond to this, but it would seem to me that it would be wiser to seek the legislative changes that would be necessary to move ahead with interim storage if that is the road we move down. And we all believe that interim storage is going to be necessary no matter what we do. But to seek those legislative changes before we do it then, rather to go out and examine and find out what we can do and then seek legislative changes and find out maybe Congress doesn't want to do it. So, I am just looking at from that perspective. But that is not a question. Secretary Brouillette. It shouldn't be any problem. Mr. Simpson. Let me ask you a couple of other short questions. One is, what is the status of WIPP? Could you provide us with an update on the status and when do you anticipate WIPP being back up and running at capacity, and how does this affect the 2021 budget request? How does that affect this timeline? Secretary Brouillette. I think what we are hoping to do is get WIPP fully up and running within the next 12 to 14 to 15 months. There is a ventilation project that you are aware of. That is coming along nicely. We hope to complete that work this year, perhaps later this year. Importantly, though, the WIPP facility itself is functioning very, very well. I appreciate your support, sir, the agreement that we struck with your state, your governor, your attorney general. Their shipments will continue. They will continue on time. And as soon as we can get the IWTU working properly, we will move that waste out of there as soon as we can. But to answer your question very succinctly, WIPP is operating very, very fine right at the moment. We hope to expand its capacity and upgrade its facilities within the next 12 to 14 months. Mr. Simpson. I want to thank you, personally, and your Department for working with Governor Little and Attorney General Wasden to update the Idaho settlement agreement. It was very important to Idaho, and I think it was very important to the Federal Government, also. While the administration, Congress, and the states work toward a solution to storage and disposal of used fuel, it seems to me that the Department of Energy should be doing what it can now to get the used fuel in Idaho road ready by characterizing it and packaging it like the Navy does. Is DOE considering including that type of scope in the next Idaho cleanup contract, which is coming up? And if not, would you be willing to take a look at how that scope might be incorporated and get back to me? Are there other steps that we can take to get EM and NE working together to get used fuel in Idaho road ready? Secretary Brouillette. I would certainly be open to that conversation. And I would be happy to follow-up with you. Mr. Simpson. OK. Secretary Brouillette. And it is something I think we need to think through. Mr. Simpson. I appreciate it. And, finally, I just want to ask you, in fiscal year 2018, the fiscal year 2018 Act, we included direction to both the Department of Energy and the comptroller general to review certain aspects of the Department's Payment in Lieu of Taxes or PILT programs. GAO released its report this past October. DOE's response in that report stated that, ``A working group would be convened to identify high-level options for the program and to recommend any necessary and appropriate changes to DOE leadership for review and approval by March 31, 2020.'' What is the status of the DOE review on that? And is the working group activities identified with the GAO report? Secretary Brouillette. Still working on it. Mr. Simpson. Still working on it? Secretary Brouillette. Still working on it, and I understand your concerns very, very clearly. And I will come back up and personally brief you. Mr. Simpson. I appreciate it. It has been a pet peeve of mine. And it is not-- Secretary Brouillette. I recognize that. Mr. Simpson. The different sites out there, kind of--some of them get great PILT payments, others don't even get any PILT payments. I am not trying to take anybody's PILT payment or anything else. I am just trying to make a standard across the Department. Thank you. Secretary Brouillette. I agree with you. I think it is important that we understand what the impacts of a uniform approach would be. But as soon as we are done with that working group, and as soon as I get a little bit more clarity on their findings, I will come up and personally brief you on it. Mr. Simpson. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Thanks for being here today. Secretary Brouillette. Yes, sir, thank you for having me. Ms. Kaptur. Congressman Fleischmann. Mr. Fleischmann. Thank you, again, Madam Chair. And this has been a great hearing, Mr. Secretary. I really appreciate this. Secretary Brouillette. Thank you, sir. Mr. Fleischmann. Thank you, sir. While I was sitting here, I began to think about a new initiative of the Department, and I want to praise and laud you for that. This is AI. Secretary Brouillette. Sure. Mr. Fleischmann. We were asked last year to fund that and I believe we did that at $2.5 million. I thought that was the right move. I was very pleased to see that the President has requested, I think, $5 million in that budget. Secretary Brouillette. He did. Mr. Fleischmann. So, I think, again, another great move in the right direction. AI is going to be critically important. Mr. Secretary, you had mentioned PNNL. I appreciate that. I did not know that they were as well advanced in AI. Do we see the potential for more of the national labs participating in that endeavor? And I just would like your thoughts on that. Secretary Brouillette. Well, I certainly didn't mean to exclude the good work that is being done at Oak Ridge. Mr. Fleischmann. Yes, sir. No, I did not think any---- Secretary Brouillette. They are, you know--as you know, they have the fastest supercomputer in the world at the summit program there. But they are also leaders in AI as well. And I look forward to working with Dr. Zacharia and others at Oak Ridge to move forward. What we have done at the Department of Energy and under former Secretary Perry's leadership is created sort of a coordinating office. And that is the office that you are referring to. There are many, many efforts all throughout DOE that are focused on AI. And what we attempted to do is to create an office to kind of collaborate and pull those efforts together so that we could perhaps focus them on a few key areas. I mentioned one earlier, the integration of renewables into our electric grid. That is a perfect application for AI. You may recall from last year's hearing Secretary Perry initiated an effort with HHS and with the Veterans Administration to look at treatment records so that we could maybe identify things that work perhaps better than others on brain injuries. So, dealing with PTSD or concussions, if we can identify treatments that have worked in a much more aggressive and faster way, then it will help, you know, doctors treat these things in real time. And we just have found so many applications for this technology, but-- Ms. Kaptur. Would the gentleman yield on that point? Secretary Brouillette. Yes, ma'am. Ms. Kaptur. I know Secretary Perry and Congressman Gonzalez of Ohio have a deep interest on the imaging issues and the brain analysis. Has DOE written anything on that or could you bring the committee up to date by providing some additional information to the record? Secretary Brouillette. I would be happy to reply for the record. I would be happy to share with you some of the initial findings that we have. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you. Secretary Brouillette. I would be happy to do that, Madam Chair. Mr. Fleischmann. Once again, Mr. Secretary, I want to applaud and laud the Department for choosing to create this office of AI. I think it is going to be a great way to coordinate all of your efforts, and we will fully support--or I will fully support that. Secretary Brouillette. Thank you, sir. I appreciate that. Ms. Kaptur. Congressman Newlove. Mr. Newhouse. Newhouse. Ms. Kaptur. We have a real estate company in northwest Ohio. I apologize. That is Newlove Realty. So, I have to really concentrate here. Mr. Newhouse. I wasn't sure what to say back to you, Madam. But thank you, Madam Chair. Secretary Brouillette. That is funny. Mr. Newhouse. So, Mr. Secretary, I promised you there was good news, but there is also bad news. Secretary Brouillette. Sure. Mr. Newhouse. And so I wanted to get to that part of my questioning. And just let me tell you directly, and I know that this has been brought up already. I can't tell you how disappointed I was to see this administration playing politics with something as important as completing the permanent solution to our Nation's high-level nuclear waste. I was recently, just the week before last, invited to the White House to talk about Yucca Mountain and I expressed my concerns directly to everybody that I could except for the President himself. Simply put, the law of the land is that Yucca Mountain is this Nation's sole permanent repository for high-level waste. And this budget pointing to, I think, what you characterize as a reinvention of the wheel is, in my humble opinion, a total waste of resources and a distraction from solving this very important issue for this whole country. Nobody in this Congress, no district, is more dependent on Yucca Mountain as Washington State's 4th. The Hanford Site's high-level nuclear waste is destined for Yucca Mountain. And, Madam Chair, no obfuscation, no politization of this issue, be it from Republicans, and we have seen it from Democrats, will change the fact that this is the law. And so, Mr. Secretary, I am disappointed. I told the powers that be in the White House that I will fight this with everything I have got. I just wanted to be on record with you so you know where I am coming from. This is important to the people of the State of Washington. Just as importantly, it is important to this country that we continue working on this very important project that we have already put upwards of $15 billion literally into a hole in the ground that would be a sure sign of fiscal irresponsibility for us to just stop. Very much related to this, as you know, there are no less than 56 million gallons of nuclear waste stored in temporary underground storage tanks at the Hanford Site. The Federal Government has a moral and a legal obligation to cleanup this waste. And I know the Department of Energy is committed to that. But I was truly disappointed to see proposed cuts of over $700 million from the current levels for the Hanford cleanup in fiscal year 2021 in the budget request. I probably don't have to tell you this, but I will, at the proposed funding level, cleanup efforts would be profoundly impacted for the worse, and a number of important and successful efforts would be halted, including the 300-296 waste site remediation under the 324 building, the 200 West area groundwater pump and treat operations, the proactive sitewide risk mitigation, and work at the Waste Encapsulation and Storage Facility, the WESF, would be impacted. In order for the U.S. Government to fulfill its obligation, consistent and predictable funding is absolutely critical. I don't think I need to point out that the Environmental Management is the third largest liability across the entirety of our Federal Government. Anything less only prolongs cleanup and dramatically increases the costs. So, respectfully, Mr. Secretary, I do not believe the proposed level of funding meets the Federal Government's obligations in what is needed to ensure success at Hanford, both in the near term, but also on into the future. Secretary Brouillette. Thank you for that, Mr. Newhouse. I appreciate your concerns. The short answer is, yes, I do believe the President's current budget allows us to meet the moral obligations that we have to the State of Washington, as well as to the Nation. The reductions that you see in our budget are taken primarily from what we refer to as carryover funding. The Congress has been extremely generous to us with regard to the EM program. As you know and as we discussed earlier, none of the projects that are currently underway are scheduled for startup, i.e., DFLAW, this year will be affected by this request. We fully intend to hot start DFLAW this year. And the other projects that we are proud of in 2019 and we will continue accomplishing in 2020 are things like the K-basin cleanup. We moved some of the facilities away. We were able to stop those activities from endangering any of the groundwater or any of the river water, the Columbia River. We are very proud of those accomplishments. We will continue those. But I look forward to working with you and I understand your concerns. Hanford is a moral obligation for the Nation and the State, that we have--I mean, I am sorry, the Nation as I mentioned earlier. But it has also been something that I have been personally involved with since my earliest days as a staffer here on the Hill. I remember distinctly working with the Energy and Commerce Committee on this issue 20 years ago. And to be honest, I was a bit dismayed to come back 20 years later and see that many of the same issues still face us. There as been tremendous progress, however, at Hanford. It looks dramatically different than when I first visited that site in the early 1990s. But yet, there is much more to be done. And I look forward to working with you on that. Mr. Newhouse. I appreciate that. As I said earlier, I look forward to being a partner with you in making sure that we can continue the Federal Government's, as you said, legal and moral obligation here at Hanford, so, thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you, Congressman Newhouse. Mr. Secretary, your budget proposes deep and arbitrary cuts that threaten progress on addressing one of our most pressing challenges and that is climate change. We can be a leader in exporting clean energy technologies, but not under your budget request. There is a significant global market for these types of technologies right now and into the future. And your budget request significantly disadvantages the United States. What is your plan to assure this does not happen? Secretary Brouillette. Well, I appreciate your concern, Madam Chair. I think as we move forward, though, as I mentioned earlier in the hearing, we need to do a couple different things. We need to focus on storage. That is where our attention needs to be. Renewable technologies are becoming somewhat mature in the marketplace. So, for us to focus again on these technologies that are now commercially widely available seems to us to be inappropriate. The market has taken off and we have seen the evidence of that in the pricing of the product itself. Wind electricity is now trading in some places across our country at 3 cents a kilowatt hour, 4 cents a kilowatt hour. So, to subsidize or to further those types of technologies from a governmental standpoint seems for us to be inappropriate. Our focus needs to be on what do we do to get these technologies integrated into the grid? What do we need to do to get them more widely available at a grid level, not an individual level, not at the household level? Anyone can walk in today to one of these companies that are usually perched outside of a Home Depot or a Lowe's or something like that and they can sign up for solar technologies and have those installed on their house or go to their local utility and get that installed relatively quickly. Our challenge is to get that to a grid-scale level. And that is what we want to focus on and that is what you see reflected in our budget and that is why you see the numbers you see. Ms. Kaptur. Without the Department of Energy, most of those companies wouldn't have moved into the 21st century at this point. So, I don't think we share a point of view on that, but hopefully we can find a way to blend our interests on this one. Secretary Brouillette. Sure. I think our goals are the same. I don't think we disagree on the ultimate goal. And I think you see that in the approach that we have taken with regard to the provision of energy and the energy policy that I think the previous administrations, this administration, previous Congresses and this Congress have worked upon. And that is why we can point to these records that we have today. While we have been able to grow the economy in the country by roughly 17 percent, we are also reducing our carbon emissions at the same time by about 14 percent. There is no other country in the world that can say that. There is no other developed country that can say that and there is certainly no undeveloped country that can say that. So, I think the record speaks for itself and it is due to the good work that previous administrations, this administration, previous Congresses, this Congress have undertaken. So, I think our goals are aligned. Perhaps direction may change from here and there, but I look forward to working with you on this issue. I think we are fully committed to the same outcome. Ms. Kaptur. If I look back at the fracking technology that exists today, when DOE started inventing it, I don't know how many decades it actually took. It was probably close to 2 decades, wasn't it? Secretary Brouillette. A very long time. A very long time, about 20 years. Ms. Kaptur. And most companies wouldn't do that. We are very happy about natural gas now. Secretary Brouillette. Sure. Ms. Kaptur. But if we really--or solar technologies. I was involved with an Ohio company back in the '80s trying to help them hang on. Thank God, there was photovoltaic research division at the Department of Energy because there wasn't anybody in the venture capital world back then that was interested. The Department is really important in the basic research area so that we can launch more companies faster and move some of this really basic research forward. Secretary Brouillette. We don't disagree with that. It is one of the reasons why we created a chief technology officer within the company itself, I mean, within the Department itself. It is to move those types of technologies to the marketplace as quickly as we possibly can. And your example about fracking is exactly right. We helped invent the technology, but it wasn't until George Mitchell picked it up in the private sector and really utilized it in ways that at the time. It is that type of innovation, it is that type of entrepreneurship, it is that type of progress that we need to see not only with fracking, but with solar technologies and, as I mentioned earlier, with nuclear technologies. Some of these advanced reactors are absolutely critical to any climate goal we may have in the future. Ms. Kaptur. I wanted to say a word about workforce development if I could. Secretary Brouillette. Yes, ma'am. Ms. Kaptur. Our energy sector is rapidly changing. And we know and you know we need to have a skilled energy workforce that can keep up. We have also heard repeatedly from senior Department officials and our national labs that the Department's workforce is changing. And we aren't producing enough American engineers, scientists, and skilled labor and trade workers to meet the national need. And yet, we are again seeing a budget request that proposes to slash many of the very programs that require this workforce. And it again cuts or eliminates programs that support workforce development. I mentioned in my opening statement that solar installers are projected to be the fastest-growing job in this country over the next 10 years. That is why I am so disheartened to see that the budget request proposes to eliminate the Solar Ready Vets Program. What role do you believe the Department of Energy should have in helping to inspire, to train, perhaps even to fund some of the next generation of skilled workers to take advantage of these tremendous economic opportunities of the future? Secretary Brouillette. I would be happy to work with the committee on finding very specific programs that we might fund to do this. I can tell you from my own personal experience, growing up in south Louisiana, starting an early career working in the oilfield and working in the pipeline industry, the importance of training trades. I have done everything from pipefitting to welding to general laborer. And those are all skills that may sound simple. You have to learn early on in life in order to be successful on an offshore drilling rig. And it was so remarkably different than what I saw as a kid, as a young roustabout, and as a young pipeline worker. When I went onto a deck back then, there was 20 or 30 people moving pipe around. When I went onto the deck this time, there was one person there, that is it. And he was running But my point is that I was able to just last year or year before last, as a matter of fact, visit an of a computerized operation. Well, that skill set is remarkably different than the welding skill set that I brought to the table 20, 25 years ago. And if we are not preparing for that and we are not planning for that today, then we are going to be woefully behind China, behind other developing nations in a very near future. So, we have to focus on this now. One of the things I have done as Secretary and it is a small step but I think an important step. Whenever I travel to a national laboratory, I make a point of doing an hour or 2- hour lunch with young professionals who just started at our Department, who just started with one of our contractors within the last 5 years. Because I want to know from them what did they do to get here, what brought them here, why did they choose us as an employer versus Google or some other alternative or option that they may have had graduating college? Understanding those fundamental decisions that people make today versus what I made 25 years ago or 30 years ago, I think is key for us to find the answer. That is what we have to do. But we have to focus on it. It has to be an aggressive effort. It has to be intentional. It can't be something we just think about or that we assume is happening within the organization. Because I can almost assure you, it won't. If we don't focus on it, it won't happen. So, you have my commitment to that. I would work closely with you. If you have specific ideas that you would want me to focus on, I would be completely open to that. Ms. Kaptur. Well, Mr. Secretary, I think we could start with a list of those professions, some of which you have ticked off now, that are going to be the most in demand. And let's lead with the list. And whether it is NNSA or the Department of Energy or the labs themselves, it would be very helpful to provide that for the record. And last year, we had hearings that dealt with some of the workforce development, but I think it would be of great interest to this subcommittee to hear from the nuclear Navy. We have heard about nuclear welders. I always ask myself, isn't there an easier way to do that job? So, maybe we need some innovation there. But the workforce development responsibility doesn't just lie with the Department of Labor or the private sector. Because guess what, they have got vacancies and some of them have huge needs. I think everybody has to do their part. Secretary Brouillette. You are absolutely correct, Madam Chair. With all due respect to my colleagues at the Department of Labor, I am not sure they understand completely what we need in a national laboratory. It is up to us. It is our obligation. We are the ones running the national laboratories. We are the ones running the Department of Energy. We have to determine our own skill sets, our own labor needs, and move aggressively to develop them. Ms. Kaptur. Now, it took me 38 years to get a gavel on this committee, and I want to share is a couple ideas. I am just going to use my privilege here for a couple more minutes. I won't bore my colleagues too much, but two interests that I have that you can answer. I care about poor cities. I spent my life trying to rebuild places in poor cities that need new value. And one of the ways that we can actually help them help themselves is to study where they spend the most out of their budget, which is all public information, on energy. And they spend it purifying water and processing sewage. In most of these places, upwards of a third or more of their power budget goes to those two functions. Most people will say, well, that is not the Department of Energy's job because really it is EPA's job to worry about water and about sewer. Well, but the power issue isn't their job. And an evaluation of, well, let's actually pick the 50 poorest cities in America and I represent some of them. And it isn't just a matter of buying a gauge that you stick on and it costs more money and you keep trying to retool old technology. But maybe there is something transformative that the Department of Energy could invent, even offsite or related to the property that these facilities exist on. It is a hidden cost and it is enormous. Just in northern Ohio, and it was hard to get this information because nobody thinks about it, between the whole lower coastline of Lake Erie, between Cleveland, OH, Lorain, OH, a steel town, one of the largest automotive platforms and truck platforms in the country, in 10 years, the mayors there combined will spend a half a billion dollars. That is a lot of money to those places. So, I am not saying we should move in small nuclear units. But there are solutions that can be adjacent to or one could think of how to retool. And I would just ask some attention to that. Secretary Brouillette. If you will permit me maybe a moment of personal privilege perhaps I can introduce an idea that may be of interest. The committee has over the years provided very generous funding to our laboratories. And as part of that process you allow the lab directors to conduct what is known as lab-directed research. This may be a perfect project for a young scientist coming on board with one of our national laboratories. And perhaps together, we can work with the lab directors to see if there might be interest under the lab- directed research programs to allow some young scientist to take this on as a project and develop some solutions. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you for your openness. We provided some funding in the advanced manufacturing program at DOE to look at it. But I just wanted you to hear it from me. Secretary Brouillette. Sure, I appreciate that. Ms. Kaptur. And to say these places can't pave their roads. So, the need for being able to provide power and to reduce the cost, they don't have time to think about it. So, maybe we could be of some help. Finally, I just wanted to say, we talked about this, put it on the record now, but we talked about the building that is the U.S. Department of Energy. And I would want to encourage you to think about the building envelope better reflecting what you do. I am not quite sure how to work with GSA on that or even how to work with this subcommittee. But we know we have to inspire the next generation. And millions of these young people walk around here every year, they come to Washington with their parents and they go to the Air and Space Museum across the street, they go to the Spy Museum. They go to all these places. The Department of Energy has a role to play in this. And DOE can communicate with these young people. There is nothing like seeing and believing. I would encourage you to think about aiming at some middle school students, perhaps. Coordinate with the science museums across this country. Your communication staff can do that. Think about private sector interest that might be able to help you sponsor some celebratory days that would over time--over time would begin to influence the American people and these younger people that we know we want to come into these fields, to make it exciting for them. And just in repairing your building envelope, finding a way, we will try to help. I will do what I can do. But some of these new building materials, I remember when I worked for President Carter and I wasn't on his energy team, but he wanted to put solar up on the building. And when Jim Oberstar, before Jim left here within the last decade or so, I think it finally happened. But all I remember is Rep. Oberstar complaining all the time about why can't we get those solar panels up there at the Department of Energy? Secretary Brouillette. It is still up there. Ms. Kaptur. It is still up there, but it is antiquated, I think. Secretary Brouillette. I think it puts out 1 kilowatt, I am not sure. Enough to turn on two lightbulbs maybe. Ms. Kaptur As you think about working with the building materials industry or the energy industry, you have friends and the Department has friends and they are doing magnificent things. Maybe you could have a day where some of the tiny homes people come and erect a net zero home. And everybody that walks by that month goes, wow, look at that. It is happening in America, but it is not reflected here very well. Maybe you can't do it physically, maybe you can do it virtually on a screen. I don't want to belabor it, but I just think that it is time for a little refurbishment and for inspiration for the country because we know we need it. I have lived long enough to know what it was like to be energy-dependent and now to be 90 percent of the way to independence at the moment, but not for the next century, just for the next few years, and that this Department has been chugging away, that is a story. That is a story. And it shouldn't just be for the specialized energy magazines, but it should be on National Geographic, it should be in a lot of other places. And it should be in every science museum in this country. I ask you to think about that a little bit. And I would say to my ranking member, do you have any final questions or comments? Mr. Simpson. Thank you. I do have just a couple of things that have come up since I said goodbye. I was never going to say anything about Yucca Mountain at this hearing because, frankly, it won't make any difference. But when Mr. Newlove, you got a new nickname you know that, don't you? When he brought it up, I just wanted to say, as I have told Secretary Moniz and Secretary Perry, whatever you do, do not fill in that tunnel. That is a $16 billion tunnel and we are going to store all the studies that have been done on Yucca Mountain. Second, while we like to criticize where we think you are deficient in this budget, I do want to thank you for the increase requested for Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response. That is, I think, one of the biggest challenges this country faces. And it is actually a very small budget compared to, I think, the challenge we are going to face in the future. I appreciate the request for that. One other thing I wanted to ask is, you have proposed in this budget to move the FUSRAP program from the Corps to DOE. Whose idea is that? Is that OMB's or Department of Energy's? Because we looked at this last year and we thought, OK, what we are going to do is we are going to move the program to DOE. That means we will send the money to DOE and DOE is going to contract with the Army Corps of Engineers to do exactly what they are doing now. That didn't seem like an additional layer of government that would be necessary or very efficient in cleaning up these sites. Secretary Brouillette. Yes, it is a fair point, sir. I don't know where the idea originated, but I would be happy to get back to you. If you don't mind, I would just like to take that question for the record and get back to you in writing. Mr. Simpson. I appreciate it. I am not necessarily opposed to it. I just don't see what the value of it is. That is kind of where I am coming from. Let me rephrase what I think you said to Representative Newhouse and I think this is what you said. That with this budget we will be able to meet all the state agreements we have with the various states on EM, on the cleanup agreements unless something really strange happens. Secretary Brouillette. Right. Unless there is a curveball that I am not aware of, yes. Mr. Simpson. OK. Secretary Brouillette. And if you don't mind, sir, Madam Chair, if I could add another point. My staff handed me a question and I think I misspoke when I was talking to Congressman Newhouse. The DFLAW, I stated that it was ready for hot start. It is actually, we are going to complete construction. Hot start won't start until 2023. I wanted to correct the record for that, I misspoke. My apologies. Mr. Simpson. Thank you. Ms. Kaptur. All right, thank you. That concludes this hearing. Again, I would like to thank Secretary Brouillette for joining us today and all of his staff members and those who have sat with us this afternoon. I ask that for the hearing record, questions for the record and any supporting information requested by the subcommittee are delivered in final form to us no later than 3 weeks from the time you receive them. Members who have additional questions for the record will have until the close of business on Tuesday, March 3, to provide them to the subcommittee office. This hearing is adjourned. [Material submitted for inclusion in the record follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] [GRAPHIC(S) FORMAT] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Tuesday, March 3, 2020 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY APPLIED ENERGY PROGRAMS WITNESSES HON. RITA BARANWAL, ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR NUCLEAR ENERGY ALEXANDER GATES, OFFICE OF CYBERSECURITY, ENERGY SECURITY, AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE HON. DANIEL SIMMONS, ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND RENEWABLE ENERGY HON. BRUCE WALKER, ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR ELECTRICITY HON. STEVEN WINBERG, ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR FOSSIL ENERGY Ms. Kaptur. The subcommittee will come to order. I want to thank all of the members for coming. Let us begin our second hearing on the Fiscal Year 2021 Budget Request for the Department of Energy's Applied Energy programs. Thank you to our witnesses for being here. We come together this afternoon to discuss the Department of Energy's Applied Energy programs, which cover energy efficiency, electric grid modernization and security, and energy technology such as renewables, nuclear and fossil. The energy future of our country depends on the Department of Energy's vital investments to achieve breakthroughs to solve our toughest energy challenges. And if you look at that chart up there, I think it is so wonderful to see that as a country, since the Department was first created we have actually helped America come out of a deep nose dive, in terms of domestic energy independence. The Department's programs are at the epicenter of these efforts and past successes of your programs have increased energy security and resulted in the United States becoming a net energy exporter, as shown from the Energy Information Administration's chart upon the wall. Looking toward fiscal year 2021, however, the Trump administration again proposes to cut the Department of Energy's budget, this time by an astounding 35 percent in non-defense programs. This will limit America's future opportunities by drastically reducing or eliminating programs critical for meeting our future energy needs and assuring our security. These programs have received bipartisan, bicameral support precisely because of their crucial role in undergirding our economy and preparing our Nation for the futures to come, including the clean energy economy. One need look no further than a recent Bureau of Labor Statistics listing of key job categories seeking employees, and first on the list is solar installers, like you see pictured here, to know that these programs already are major job creators and we face tremendous international competition, and also theft of intellectual property developed in this country. This budget request also returns to the Trump administration's seeming obsession with funding only early- stage research and development. As I told Secretary Brouillette in last week's hearing, private industry has repeatedly stated that they would not fund the kind of middle- and later-stage research and development including demonstrations that are proposed for elimination in this request. Without these critical Federal investments we won't be able to move early-stage R&D forward and really continue to launch companies to the stage that private investors will pick up the work. Abandoning this research sends a blank check to China and our global competitors. It turns our back on promising research that is critical to reinventing the American energy economy. And I am reminded of a quote from Robert Kennedy, ``Some people see things as they are and say why, I dream things that never were, and say, why not.'' I think it is good to always look to the future. These ill-advised cuts are almost too frequent to enumerate, but allow me to point out a few particular egregious examples, all right, energy efficiency and renewable energy funding slashed by 74 percent? Really? Technologies like those displayed upon the wall will all be cut by 76 to 83 percent, including vehicle technologies, bioenergy technologies, building technologies and advanced manufacturing. Also proposed for elimination, the weatherization program which is so pivotal to achieving energy conservation for existing structures and helping low-income families, including our seniors, to reduce their cost and, frankly, to help us meet our goal of energy independence with 40 percent conservation across our country. Third, carbon-free nuclear energy research and development, cut by 21 percent. Carbon capture utilization and storage research within Fossil Energy cut by 44 percent. Really? And finally, Resilient Distribution Systems within the Office of Electricity is cut by nearly 60 percent. That program focuses on technologies to ensure that the distribution portion of the electric grid can withstand and recover from disruptions. Given the increasing frequency and severity of storms and the potential of increasing cyber attacks, our Nation simply cannot cede our future to chance. Unfortunately, once again, the President's budget request harms American leadership and our energy future, our competitiveness, our environment, our workforce, our consumers, and our economy. With that, I will close my remarks thanking all of you for attending today, certainly all of our Department of Energy witnesses for being here. We look forward to discussing this request and adapting it accordingly. I would like to turn to our capable Ranking Member, Mr. Simpson, for his opening remarks. [The prepared statement of Ms. Kaptur follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT TIFF FORMAT] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Simpson. Thank you, Chairwoman Kaptur. And I appreciate your opening remarks. I would like to welcome our five witnesses to today's hearing for the Fiscal Year 2021 Budget Request from the Department of Energy's Applied Energy programs. As was made clear at last week's hearings with Secretary Brouillette, the budget request for many of these programs is not as robust as most of us on this Committee would prefer. We should argue now, however, that within the budget request, many of the priorities are activities with broad bipartisan support, even if at lowered funding levels than some of us would like to see. For example, the request includes robust funding for cybersecurity work, it emphasizes efforts to advance energy storage technologies, it recognizes the importance of critical minerals to our energy sector and, in turn, to our economic and national security. From a management perspective, the request focuses attention on several cross-cutting initiatives to ensure DOE's various offices are working together to better understand and address challenges across the energy sector, better coordination across programs can help avoid duplication of efforts and help spur innovative solutions to those programs. There will certainly be areas where Congress will want to provide additional resources above the budget request. Personally, I would like to see a higher budget for the Office of Nuclear Energy to help ensure that the next generation of nuclear technologies is led by American technology. Advanced nuclear technologies will be necessary to achieve any low- carbon energy goals, and have those technologies be American technologies, it is important for our economic competitiveness and national security. To our witnesses; thank you for being here today to explain your budget request. I look forward to hearing more about the administration's priorities in these areas, and thank you again, Ms. Kaptur, for calling this hearing today. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much, Mr. Simpson. We will now turn to our witnesses. First we will have Bruce Walker, the Assistant Secretary for the Office of Electricity. Mr. Walker previously served as Deputy County Executive, founded a consulting firm, focused on electric utilities, and worked for several electricity-related companies. Next we will have Daniel Simmons, the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. Mr. Simmons previously worked at the Institute for Energy Research at the American Legislative Exchange Council, and on the House Committee on Natural Resources. Following that, we will have Steven Winberg, the Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy. Mr. Winberg has 39 years of experience in the energy industry including at Foster Wheeler, Consolidated Natural Gas, CONSOL, Energy Research & Development, and Battelle Memorial Institute. Then we will have Rita Baranwal, the Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy. Dr. Baranwal previously directed the Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear at the Idaho National Laboratory, and she also has private sector experience at Westinghouse and Battelle. And finally we will have Alexander Gates, Senior Advisor for Cybersecurity, Energy Security and Emergency Response. Mr. Gates joined the Department of Energy from the National Security Agency. He has 4 decades of experience in military and civil service-related, to national security, cybersecurity and signals intelligence. Thank you all for taking the time to be here today. Without objection your written statements will be entered into the record. Please feel free to summarize your remarks in about 3 minutes each, starting with Assistant Secretary Walker. STATEMENT OF HON. BRUCE WALKER Mr. Walker. Thank you. Madam Chairwoman, Ranking Member Simpson and Members of Committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the fiscal year 2021 request for the Office of Electricity, OE. Today we are faced with many opportunities and challenges, resulting from a dynamically-changing electric grid. In real time the electric grid is adapting to a rapidly-changing generation of fuel mix, the increased utilization of renewable resources, and significant interdependencies between electric generation and natural gas pipelines. Furthermore, our industry is responsible for providing an essential national security commodity while nation and state actors continue to attempt to thwart our ability to operate through nefarious cyber operations. With keen awareness of these opportunities and challenges, OE's fiscal year 2021 request of $195 million builds upon our existing partnerships through the national lab complex, industry and academia. While I will highlight several areas of the request, I would note that additional funding supports important work that is integral and complementary to the overall success of our mission to increase the resilience of our Nation's electric grid. Number 1, we are developing the North American Energy Resilience Model, the NAERM. As a first of a kind model, it comprehensively integrates and analyzes both power energy infrastructure, in addition to providing near real time awareness of the system, by utilizing advanced sensing capabilities, coupled with sophisticated modeling techniques, it will also identify opportunities to reduce congestion charges, facilitate the strategic integration of renewable energy resources, and optimize the placement and utilization of grid-scale storage. The funding for NAERM, advancing the sensing capabilities, and advanced transition modeling requests equal $21 million, $8.5 million and $25 million respectively. The development of the NAERM will also help inform potential future investments necessary for defense, critical electric infrastructure. Accordingly, the fiscal year 2021 request includes a new budget line. Defense critical energy infrastructure, energy mission assurance, working with key partners across the Federal Government, and throughout the industry, this funding will support the development of executable strategies to strengthen the energy infrastructure systems, to supply critical defense facilities, and their associate defense critical electric infrastructure. Number 2, we are on the precipice of developing affordable, commercially available, megawatt-scale bidirectional electric storage that does not rely on foreign-sourced critical minerals. To this end we propose investing $43.5 million in research and development supporting the Energy Storage Grand Challenge announced earlier this year by Secretary Brouillette, which will utilize the Department's expertise to address technology development, commercialization, manufacturing, utilization and workforce needs. In addition, in fiscal year 2020, we proposed launching the Grid Storage Launchpad at Pacific Northwest National Lab, to accelerate the development of a megawatt-scale storage. We continue our efforts in this endeavor through the fiscal year 2021 request for $40 million for GSL. OE's fiscal year 2021 request of $195 million will give our team the tools and resource that helps secure our Nation's electric grid. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, ranking member and members of the committee. I looking forward to answering any questions you may have. [The prepared statement of Mr. Walker follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE TIFF FORMAT] [GRAPHIC(S) IN TIFF FORMAT] Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much, Mr. Walker. We were just looking at that slide trying to see the colors from here, the blue actually represents power generated by wind, the yellow by solar, and the red by nuclear. We are not sure what the green is, as we can't see it from here. Mr. Walker. Madam Chairwoman, if I may? Despite being with the Department of Energy, this slide actually is a dynamic slide that rolls through the 24 hours in the day, and what you will see when it actually runs, the file was too big to actually upload it, is that you will see the changing generation of fuel mix as the sun really rolls through the country. And this is a representation of just a small part of work that we have been doing, working with the EERE as well, that NREL provided to demonstrate what the NAER-M would look like in the future. Ms. Kaptur. How interesting. We will succeed when we are able to demonstrate that to the American people, including through our hearings. We are sure looking for a way to do that. Maybe you can find some of the geniuses over there to help us. That would be really nice. Thank you so much, Mr. Walker. Assistant Secretary Simmons, please begin. STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL SIMMONS Mr. Simmons. Thank you. Chairwoman Kaptur, Ranking Member Simpson and members of Committee, thank you for your time. The President's fiscal year 2021 budget request provides $719 million for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, EERE, to uphold America's energy dominance through technologies to make energy more affordable, reliable and efficient. Nearly half of the EEREs requested budget in fiscal year 2021 supports inter-programmatic or cross-cutting initiatives. These $225 million in investments represent EERE's commitment to coordinating high priority activities across this portfolio, and within the Department. Collaboration has been one of my priorities since I became Assistant Secretary, and this budget reflects that. I thank my colleagues on this panel for their support as we work together on these cross-cutting initiatives. In the interest of time, I will highlight three of EERE's cross cuts for the subcommittee, as seen on the following slides. First, the Department requested $97 million in fiscal year 2021 for the Energy Storage Grand Challenge, a DOE-wide strategy to accelerate the development, commercialization and utilization of next-generation energy storage technologies. Energy storage is a top priority for the Department, as we move to a future with a wider array of energy options than we have ever seen before, the need to integrate all of these technologies is increasingly important, and we believe that energy storage is a key way to do that. Second, the Department requested $53 million in fiscal year 2021 in support of President Trump's Executive Order 13817, issued in December 2017, to develop a Federal strategy to ensure secure and reliable supplies of critical minerals. The fiscal year 2021 request elevates critical minerals activities across DOE to an interdepartmental initiative. Critical materials are used in many products important to the American energy economy, but the United States imports most of our critical mineral commodities. America's dependence on foreign sources of critical minerals undermines our energy security and national security. Third, the Department requests $20.5 million in fiscal year 2021 to accelerate innovations in energy efficient plastic recycling technologies. EERE will explore novel technologies, and approaches to economically deconstructing existing plastics, increased opportunities for upcycling, and develop infinitely recyclable polymers. Plastics play an important role in our daily lives; they are in the things that we use every day, the things to keep us safe and healthy, the things that make our lives more enjoyable, productive and convenient. The purpose of the plastic innovation challenge is to reduce the energy costs associated with the recycling of plastics, develop new polymers that are recyclable by design, and develop biological and chemical methods to deconstruct plastic waste, including from oceans and rivers, into useful chemical feedstock streams. Lastly, EERE will continue to work to work on the Water Security Grand Challenge, the grid modernization and other initiatives are outlined in the budget request. I look forward to working with you to advance affordable and reliable energy that keeps our Nation prosperous and secure. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before the subcommittee today. I look forward to your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Simmons follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE TIFF FORMAT] [GRAPHIC(S) IN TIFF FORMAT] Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much, Mr. Simmons. We will move on to Steven Winberg, please. STATEMENT OF HON. STEVEN WINBERG Mr. Winberg. Chairwoman Kaptur, Ranking Member Simpson, and members of the subcommittee. It is my pleasure to discuss the President's fiscal year 2021 budget request for fossil energy. The Office of Fossil Energy is committed to ensuring the Nation's abundant fossil energy resources continue to promote U.S. energy security, economic prosperity, and environmental stewardship. I would like to begin by highlighting some of our fiscal year 2021 priorities. Our flagship coal R&D program is Coal FIRST. This program will develop the coal power plant for the 21st Century, with zero or near zero emissions, and its design will meet the demands of our Nation's evolving electricity grid. Building on the advances we have made through projects like Petra Nova, the world's largest post-combustion carbon capture plant, we are continuing to advance the technology to reduce the cost and to ensure that CCUS is available for coal, and natural gas power generation, and for industrial sources of emissions. In addition, we are leveraging our decades of CCUS R&D to advance the development of direct air capture technologies. Moving on, we are writing a new chapter for coal with our coal to products work. This includes the production of rare earth elements and other critical materials from coal and coal byproducts, the development of these materials from our vast coal reserves can help reduce our reliance on foreign sources, support economic growth and increase our national security. In addition, our coal to products work is targeting new technologies to develop valuable commercial products from coal, including carbon fibers, nano material, composites, building materials, and 3-D printed materials. In the oil and gas space, we continue to focus on R&D to ensure the responsible development, distribution and storage of the Nation's oil and natural gas resources, with an emphasis on methane emission reduction. Beyond R&D the Office of Fossil Energy manages the LNG export authorization process. To date we have authorized nearly 45 billion cubic feet per day of LNG exports. In 2019 we granted 15 new long-term LNG export approvals. Our current export capacity is nearly 8 BCF per day, and at the end of this year, that capacity is expected to grow to over 10 BCF. Our LNG exports have reached 38 countries, and we are well on our way to becoming the world's top LNG exporter. With respect to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, you see the Big Hill slide here, I hope. Yes, it is there. We will continue to maintain the readiness of this national security asset to protect the U.S. economy from severe petroleum supply interruptions. And we look forward to working with Congress to ensure that the supply will continue to meet the demands of the 21st century. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Winberg follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT TIFF FORMAT] Ms. Kaptur. Thank you, Assistant Secretary Winberg. Now we will go to Assistant Secretary Baranwal. STATEMENT OF HON. RITA BARANWAL Ms. Baranwal. Good afternoon, Chairwoman Kaptur, Ranking Member Simpson, and the members of subcommittee. It is an honor to appear before you today to discuss the President's fiscal year 2021 budget request for the Office of Nuclear Energy. As the Nation's largest source of clean, reliable and resilient electricity, nuclear energy is the strategic national asset for the United States. Nuclear energy reliably generates over 55 percent of the Nation's clean energy, and about 20 percent of the electricity in the U.S. As the use of nuclear energy continues to expand internationally, U.S. leadership is being ceded to countries such as Russia and China. The unique nature of nuclear technology creates a national strategic imperative to maintain U.S. leadership, and nuclear energy, and enhance U.S. influence by being competitive in global nuclear energy markets. Sustaining the current fleet of operating nuclear plants is a priority for the Nation. Without a robust nuclear industry, we will not be able to maintain the current contributions to clean electricity generation, nor maintain the associated U.S.- based supply chains, nor the fuel cycle infrastructure necessary for a vibrant civilian nuclear industry, and strong national security. Through the Light Water Reactor Sustainability Program, NE is working to ensure that the long-term economic viability of our existing nuclear fleet is done by conducting early-stage research and development to enable the development of the technical basis for the continued reliable and economic operation of the current fleet, ass well as the development of technical solutions to enhance the economics, and performance of nuclear power plants, including investigating alternative fuels. Chairwoman Kaptur, Davis Bessie in your home State and mine, is leading a pilot project to generate hydrogen to fuel not only the Toledo bus fleet but as well fuel manufacturing sites in that area. Today, communities around the United States and internationally face limited choices in nuclear reactors which constrain nuclear energy's true potential. The market has responded through the emergence of dozens of U.S. nuclear reactor developers looking to seize this opportunity by advancing highly innovative, small, scalable, flexible, resilient and more financeable nuclear reactors. These innovative technologies include SMR's, microreactors, high temperature reactors, molten salt reactors, and liquid metal fast reactors. Having a diverse catalog of technology options will make U.S. nuclear technology vendors more attractive and competitive in the global market and able to expand into countries that have not previously considered nuclear energy as part of their energy mix. NE is working to move forward our Nation's next generating of advanced nuclear reactors so nuclear energy continues to be part of our energy mix now and well into the future. Through the Advanced Reactor Technologies and Advanced Small Modular Reactor research and development subprograms, NE support early stage R&D that helps stimulate the nuclear industry as it works to address particularly high risk fundamental technical challenges in advanced reactor concepts. Thank you very much and I look forward to answering your questions. [The prepared statement of Ms. Baranwal follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT IN TIFF FORMAT] Ms. Kaptur. Thank you. And now we will go to Mr. Alexander Gates. Thank you. Please begin. STATEMENT OF ALEXANDER GATES Mr. Gates. Good afternoon, Madam Chairwoman, ranking member and members of the committee. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you to discuss the President's fiscal year2021 budget for the Office of Cyber Security, Energy Security and Emergency Response, commonly referred to as CESER. CESER was created to help secure our Nation's energy infrastructure against all hazards, reduce the risk of, and impacts from cyber events and other disruptive events and assist the restoration activates. We are keenly aware of the cyber challenges the energy sector faces. The director of National Intelligence stated in his 2019 worldwide threat assessment that, quote, ``Our adversaries and strategic competitors will increasingly use cyber capabilities to seek political, economic, and military advantage over the United States and its allies and partners. China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, increasingly use cyber operations to threaten both minds and machines in an expanding number of ways to steal information, to influence our citizens, or to disrupt critical infrastructure. A reliable and resilient energy infrastructure is critical to U.S. economic competiveness, national security and to put it frankly, our way of life. Maturing CESER into an organization that is proactive, focused on its inherent strengths, particularly with the national labs and its relationship with the sector, are keys to its success. We will refine CESER's strategic plan in the coming weeks with an eye towards these following priorities. Situational awareness, obtaining, maintaining, and sharing sector-wide situational awareness would benefit the entire country and all who operate energy systems. Discovery, early detection in mitigation of malicious activity or dangerous devices is critical, a critical requirement for CESER. A robust purposeful research and development approach that tracks gaps in capabilities is central to CESER's investment strategy. And emergency response, improving the Department's performance as a coordinator for Emergency Support Function No. 12, the energy sector, under the national response framework and our role as a sector specific agent is important. And finally operationalization. Developing processes that effectively align mission with people and technology to meet clear operational objectives is an essential furthering of operationalization within CESER. I appreciate the opportunity to appear before the committee and I'll look forward to working with Congress to address the Nation's cyber and physical security challenges. [The prepared statement of Mr. Gates follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE TIFF FORMAT] [GRAPHIC(S) IN TIFF FORMAT] Ms. Kaptur. Thank you, Mr. Gates. Thank you all for your statements. As a reminder for those members president in the room when I gavel in at the beginning of the hearing I will recognize you for questions in order of seniority alternating between majority and minority until all who arrived prior to the gavel have asked questions. And for those who arrive after the hearing has started, I will recognize those members only in order of arrival, again, alternating between majority and minority. Lastly, I intend to observe the 5 minute rule for questions and answers and will now begin questioning under our normal rules. Assistant Secretary Baranwal the budget request includes $20 million, and I quote, to establish a new program for an interim storage capacity. Excuse me. Interim storage capacity. In last week's hearing with the Secretary, he stated that the Department of Energy would and I quote being development of options and look at alternatives for interim storage including the initial planning of a potential Federal site at some point in the future. What specific actions is the Department proposing in this request to develop options and look at alternatives for interim storage and how are these proposed activities different than activities that have been carried out with funds provided by Congress in the last several years? Ms. Baranwal. Thank you for the question. One of the specific actions that the Department is planning to carry out is to issue a request for a proposal, which has been drafted, and the intent is for the basic design of an interim storage facility. What we are looking forward to in the future is that there are developments in technology space that have occurred over the past several years and we are hopeful that those will manifest themselves in the responses to the RFP. Those are some of the changes that we expect to see from what you asked about the prior years. Ms. Kaptur. Do you have particular locations in mind? Is that part of the application? Ms. Baranwal. Part of the work that's going on is to identify potential sites. To succinctly answer your question, no we don't have a location in mind at the moment. Ms. Kaptur. And so who would be, what are the categories of those who are being invited to apply? How would you describe that to the general public? Governors, private companies, how are you---- Ms. Baranwal. I would have to get back to you on that. Ms. Kaptur. All right. Well, think about that one. Ms. Baranwal. Will do. Ms. Kaptur. I am going to turn it over now to Mr. Simpson. Mr. Simpson. Thank you, Chairwoman. I guess I'm kind of amazed at the budget request across the board here and I suspect you all are too, but I know you have to support the administration's budget request but in some areas, it is just woefully inadequate. In fact, I would go through most of this and say that that is the case. I am sitting here and I think one of the biggest challenges we face in this country in our security doesn't come from nuclear weapons being launched at us, while certainly that is a threat. I think the future attack on this country is going to be from cyber. And it will be every bit as damaging as if they had launched nuclear weapons at us in what it could do our country. And when you look at it, we are spending, you are requesting $184 million dollars for CESER. That is not very much money really in the total scope of things. We are requesting $195 million for the electricity program. EERE, $719 million down $2 billion from last year's appropriated level. As the chairwoman said, $1.18 billion for NE which is down 21 percent down from last year's level. And I think you said Assistant Secretary Baranwal, that it produces 55 percent of the clean energy and 20 percent of the electricity currently in our grid. It is amazing to me but as the old saying goes, the administration proposes and Congress disposes and I suspect the budget will be significantly different when we finally get done. Let me ask you, Assistant Secretary Baranwal, I strongly support the Advanced Reactors Demonstration Program established in the fiscal year 2020 Energy and Water bill, demonstrating multiple new American reactor concepts in the next 5 to 7 years will be critical to addressing low carbon energy goals and to advancing American competiveness. Since the program's success depends in part on an aggressive schedule, Congress directed the Department to streamline its procurement processes and to take out--and then take other necessary actions to ensure implementation, that implementation is not delayed. Can you please describe what steps you have taken and plan to take to streamline and otherwise improve the process to ensure timely demonstration of new reactor concepts? Ms. Baranwal. Yes, thank you for the question. We have already issued a request for information and a notice of intent and that has closed and we are reviewing the information we have received. Thirty-three different entities provided us content and so we are digesting that, looking at multiple procurement options including contracts, financial assistance and the lessons learned from other agencies such as NASA and other programs within our purview, advanced SMR, R&D and SMR licensing technical support as well. Our plan is to issue the request for proposal for this effort in the next several weeks. We have also embarked on ensuring that we are clear and transparent in communicating with the appropriators and so we have had meetings with all 4 corners and shared with them the intent in our plans for moving forward expeditiously. Mr. Simpson. You mention in your testimony the importance of the Light Water Reactor Sustainability Program. Yet there is a $16.5 million decrease in the budget request. How important is this program? Ms. Baranwal. The program is very important. The existing fleet and the continued operation of those existing reactors is the giant on whose shoulders that we will deploy advance reactor technologies. So to maintain the fleet, to maintaining the supply chain, to maintain the talent pool that is part of that community is very important. Mr. Simpson. I yield back now and will wait for another round. Ms. Kaptur. All right. Thank you, Mr. Simpson. Congresswoman Kirkpatrick. Mrs. Kirkpatrick. This budget request proposes a 74 percent cut in EERE, a level that amounts to irreversible damage to the office and its mission. I am particularly concerned about the proposal to cut the Solar Energy Technologies Office by 76 percent. Funding for the Solar Energy Technologies Office is critical to increasing solar deployment across the United States and decreasing its cost. And the program has a history of success. Solar costs dropped by over 60 percent between 2008 and 2017. The solar industry supports over 250,000 jobs in all 50 states, and my home State of Arizona ranks 6th for solar jobs nationwide. This program has helped the United States lead the way in developing, commercializing, and deploying solar technologies that are growing rapidly around the world. So here is my first question. Given the enormous cuts proposed here for the Solar Energy Technologies Office and other EERE programs, how can we ensure that renewable energy technologies can continue to develop and advance? Mr. Simmons. The budget as we have stated is focused on early stage research and development. We believe at this lower budget levels we are able to continue to drive these technologies forward, including solar, by focusing on early stage because we need to be gestating the new ideas of the future and a lot of those are going to come from early stage research and development. Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Let me ask you, is that based on a successful model that you looked at? Mr. Simmons. One example of that is the, of a success is with NREL and the NETL and the MOU that they have signed with ExxonMobil where ExxonMobil is going to spend $100 million over the next 10 years at those laboratories working on projects. And one of the reasons for that is because in the case of NREL and some of the early stage research that they have done on next generation biofuels and next generation kind of synthetic fuels and by having that basis of early stage research, from there ExxonMobil is looking to do more. So that is one example I think of how having early stage research is critical for new idea generations so that we can then hopefully move them to commercialization in the future. Mrs. Kirkpatrick. But we really don't know how that is going to work out because it is something we have just start focusing the budget on, to really focus on early stage when currently the budget has obviously or the appropriated amounts is for that early stage as well later stage research. Mrs. Kirkpatrick. And couldn't you have a budget that does both? Mr. Simmons. Well, it could be possible, yes. Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Have you looked at that and what that number might be? Mr. Simmons. That, I mean, there are many things that are considered as the, as the Department puts together the budget over the course of the year and for DOE to work with the office, to work with OMB so many things are considered as we are working towards that, the budget process. Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Well, I just really have a concern about these enormous cuts. How can we ensure that renewable energy technologies can continue to develop and advance in light of these cuts? Mr. Simmons. Well, I mean, that one thing about the cuts too is that this budget is very similar to the budget that has been in terms of size, is very similar to what has been proposed over the past few years and we have seen--and as Secretary Perry noted, it is the beginning of the process, it's not the end of the process as Representative Simpson noted. EERE has very robust funding currently under current appropriated amounts and it is a back and forth and this is the beginning of the beginning of that process. We look forward to executing on the funding as appropriated. Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Thank you very much. Again thank all of you for being here and I yield back. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much. Congressman Fleischmann. Mr. Fleischmann. Thank you, Madame Chair and Ranking Member Simpson for having this hearing today. And to each and every one of the assistant secretaries, thank you all for being here. Please convey my warmest regards to Secretary Brouillette. He did an outstanding job, very thorough, thoughtful last week when he was before us. As each and every one of you all know, I represent Oak Ridge. A great reservation, birthplace of the Manhattan Project and today leading in so many areas and it is a privilege to represent them in the House. My first question, Secretary Gates is for you, sir. Protecting our energy sector from cyber attacks is something that is a constant concern to me. Particularly the impact that bad actors could have on the grid. I recognize this committee's responsibility to provide support for the Department to ensure it has what is need for these programs. In particular, I have been very supportive of the Dark Net project which is a collaboration between the electrical power board in Chattanooga, Oak Ridge National Lab, university and industry. Dark Net is exploring ways to get critical infrastructure off the public internet and an important goal that aligns directly with this National need. My question, sir, is in your view, what additional resources might be needed for Dark Net to achieve this challenging goal, sir? Mr. Gates. Congressman, thank you for the question. Instead of going head on to the additional resources question, I'd like to cast a broader net on the challenge that we face with such projects, finding solutions with collaborations that are essential, national labs, industry that provides the expertise and then the DOE experience. Is that taking a result and operationalizing it in the sector is where the big challenge is going to hit us. How do we do that with contribution from the government and the essential support and adoption from the sector and what is that going to cost us? That is something I'm meeting frequently with Assistant Secretary Walker and looking at the challenges, what happens when we have success? What happens when we have the silver bullet? How do we actually make that impactful in the sector? That's one of the challenges we face. Dark Net is a great project. Those are the types of collaborations we need. We have them in other parts of the country with other labs and they're just essential because of the expertise that's necessary for us to find those tough answers. Mr. Fleischmann. Thank you, sir, appreciate your response. My second question deals with nuclear energy, it's directed to Assistant Secretary Baranwal. Madame Secretary, Oak Ridge National Lab has long established record in developing nuclear energy technologies and for the past 75 years has been bringing innovation in nuclear energy to the forefront from advanced reactor technologies to materials to manufacturing. In fact, bringing those examples together, ORNL is applying its broad expertise to a project called the Transformational Challenger Reactor or TCR that will help the nuclear industry with some of its greatest challenges and opportunities in cost, innovation, advanced materials, and deployment. ORNL's core research capabilities in material science, high performance computing, and nuclear engineering are being joined with unique tools and expertise at the lab's Manufacturing Demonstration Facility to demonstrate a revolutionary approach to reactor design and manufacturing that will ultimately lead to the deployment of new systems. My question is--I would--first of all, I would like to thank you for funding the TCR in the fiscal 2021 budget proposal, but I would welcome any thoughts that you might have on this project, and I look forward to working with you. Ms. Baranwal. Thank you for the question. As a materials engineer, this project is of great interest to me. I did get the chance to visit Oak Ridge last year and get an update on the project. They are making good progress, and if--as they proceed down their schedule. As you mentioned, advanced manufacturing is certainly one area that they are using in this project; digital predictive analysis is another one. And those two technological advances combined together will lead to advanced design and acceleration of new reactor concepts, new fuel types, and, so, I am very much looking forward to seeing this, seeing the outcome of this project. Mr. Fleischmann. Thank you for your answer. I believe my time is up, so, I will yield back, Madam Chair. Ms. Kaptur. Absolutely to the second. Thank you. Congressman Pocan? Mr. Pocan. Yep. Thank you, Madam Chair. I appreciate it and thank you all for being here. Assistant Secretary Simmons, I think my questions are probably more to you. So, I am going to go back to what Representative Kirkpatrick was talking about on the wind and solar cuts. They are pretty massive. I heard your answer, but I did not really hear a real answer to the question. I heard what you said, but my concern is coal and 8\\1/2\\ kilowatts of solar. I just checked my monthly bill, this month is $23.55. Take that. It is a good deal. Next month will be the cheapest. It is usually around $8, when I get to the sun that we get from this next period. It was a $23,000 investment for 8\\1/2\\ kilowatts. So, for most people, with some incentives, there is an 11-year payoff. It is not a great payoff. I am not a great investor, but I did it for other reasons. That is that second and third stage investment that you are taking away. You are still keeping the early stage R&D, but we need to get some of those ideas practically going to the market. And, as the chairwoman said, the companies are saying they do not have the resources to do that. So, if the companies cannot take an idea that may be too costly to put out there, and you are now taking away the research dollars by 76 percent for solar and 79 percent for wind, we are, basically, not taking--as a frugal Wisconsinite, you are not taking this great free resource of the sun or wind, and we are not really capitalizing on it. In addition, in Wisconsin, until our last governor got rid of some tax credits we had, we used to make windmill blades because you cannot take them real far away. That was a lot of good-paying, family-supporting jobs. Same thing with solar cells, we could be making that here. So, there is a lot of reasons why that the stages, the funding that you have taken away, mean real jobs and real applications and real savings in places like Wisconsin. So, I just would really--have a little better understanding of why those are the areas that you cut, and why you think that those are not important. Mr. Simmons. The theory of the budget, the theory of focusing on early stage research and development is because that is the most appropriate Federal role, to focus on areas that are precompetitive, so that everyone may benefit from that research, because as we get to later stage research, it can get into one proprietary technology versus another one. So, what the budget is focused on is research that benefits, we believe, all parties or all parties as much as possible. So, that is why the budget is focused on early stage because it is the most appropriate role for the Federal Government. Mr. Pocan. Yes, but I would argue, I mean, I do not think it has to be proprietary at all going into the second and third stage, and if you really want to see solar cells go on roofs' tops, we have to bring the cost down a little more. The cost has been coming down, but part of it is helping find ways to use these technologies. That is the very money that you are taking away. So, then it makes even less sense to have early stage development, if you are skipping the middle of the actual practical application of whatever idea you are coming with. That is why I think it is kind of--that is why you have to have all stages to actually make this become a reality and so we can all save money, as frugal Wisconsinites and other folks, who want to make sure that we are paying $23.55 in our monthly bill or less. I just do not know if the logic holds out, that you are going to invest in the early stage, but then not actually in making sure those technologies actually go to market and can have a practical impact. Mr. Simmons. So, one thing to note, or one important thing to note, is that every year, OMB puts out a memo on research and development. And one of the things that it says in that memo is that part of our job is to focus on early stage, but then to make sure that we are partnering as much as possible with the private sector to advance the technologies forward, the later stages of research and development are appropriately the role of private parties. But what--I think what gets missed is that it is an important part of our role to make sure that we are partnering with the private sector as much as possible. That is an important part of the budget, an important part of the theory of the budget, to have a focus on early stage research and development. Now, obviously, there is a differing opinion, so, it is why we are here today. Mr. Pocan. I will take that as OMB, but I made the mistake, and maybe we will continue this part of funding that might make some sense. Real quick, in my final seconds, you have a plastics innovation challenge in here, and University of Wisconsin-Madison is using a lot of biomass right now and doing some things, coming up with plastic alternatives. Do you believe that the future of plastics should focus on bioenergy rather than fossil fuel-derived materials? Mr. Simmons. We do not know. The point--and the point of the plastics innovation challenge is to reduce plastic waste and to do it by whatever means necessary. That includes, like, because the Bioenergy Technology Office, which includes work on bioproducts, is one of the offices in the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. We believe that there is a lot of opportunities for biobased pathways, both for bioplastics, but also deconstructions of plastics using biopathways. We think that there is a lot of opportunities, but there is also a lot of opportunities to do it with mechanical and other chemical methods. So, let us look at everything because the plastics challenge is a significant challenge, and we want to keep all of our options open. Mr. Pocan. Great. Thank you very much. I yield back. Ms. Kaptur. Congressman Newhouse? Mr. Newhouse. Thank you, Madam Chair. You had to think about that. I appreciate it. Welcome, everybody. I appreciate you being here, and as you can tell, there is a lot of interest in the administration's budget. Most conversations, I am sure, will continue, but I wanted to focus on a couple of other things. First of all, Assistant Secretary Walker, welcome to you, good to see you. I want to express my appreciation for the-- your office's strong investment that you are proposing to make in the Grid Storage Launchpad at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. The Secretary was in last week. We had a good conversation, and as we talked with him, expressed to him the Tri-Cities is very, very excited about the--playing a central role in this critical infrastructure. So, I want to express that to you, as well. We also talked about the importance of the storage for integrating the more--the renewable energy on the grid, and, certainly, that is an important part about this technology, but I know that you are also interested in protecting our defense critical infrastructure. And, so, we have a lot of that in the State of Washington, but also around the country. Could you speak to the role that you see the grid storage launchpad and the energy storage technologies, in general, that will play in the--that critical national defense mission? Mr. Walker. Absolutely, and thank you for the question. I think storage is one of the--and we have heard people talk about it as the Holy Grail of the system, the Swiss Army knife of the electric grid, and, in fact, it is both of those. As an operator, who operated the system for 20 years, storage is one of those tools that you have in your tool chest that enables you to use it for different purposes when you need it. We are focused on megawatt scale, electric bidirectional storage because it provides a number of ancillary services on the grid that are significantly important when you talk about resiliency in the grid. So, when you speak about frequency control, voltage control, voltage support, black start, whether it acts as a loader or whether it acts as a supply, storage has the ability to provide all of those capabilities into the grid. And by virtue of being a stabilizer in the grid, it also facilitates the further integration of renewable technologies comingled with existing traditional generation on the system. So, storage is really the tool that is going to enable us to move forward, to meet things, like RPS standards, to increase national security. One of our keen focuses is on the national security, particularly the critical defense facilities and the associated defense critical electric infrastructure that feeds those facilities. And when you look at megawatt scale storage, it has the opportunity to be placed strategically in the system, which is why we are building the North American Energy Resilience Model to identify where those points are. And by placing it strategically in the system, we have the ability to secure those areas, whether we couple it with things like microgrid, other renewable technologies, and existing infrastructure on the grid, that security is something that, really, cannot be matched by anything else. And it is really part of the backbone of why Secretary Brouillette announced the Energy Grid Storage challenge, and it is the cornerstone of the building of the Grid Storage Launchpad that you mentioned. Pacific Northwest National Lab, where we have the opportunity to really accelerate through collaboration, validation, and coordination, amongst 25 to 35 different labs and universities, led by the national labs, PNNL, and, most importantly, and the reason PNNL really became the best choice for us, as we had to go through the CD-0 and the CD-1 analysis, is last year we opened up the Chemistry Center. And about 2 years ago, we made a huge change in our portfolio for energy storage, and rather than focusing on rare earth mineral technology, things like vanadium and lithium, we took a look at opportunities to use rare earth minerals that are ubiquitously available and cheap in the United States. And to that end, we are now using redox equation flow batteries and being able to leverage the chemistry capabilities of PNNL. And the new chemistry lab enables us to reach that megawatt scale storage in a very, very short period of time. While we are focused on that, we are also focused on things like sodium and manganese for use in that storage technology, again, highly available. We can build megawatt-scale storage off them, and we will have the capability to use them, not only for national security, but for further integration of different types of technology into the system. So, thank you for the question. Mr. Newhouse. Yep. Thank you very much for that complete answer. Like I said, we are very excited about being involved in this critical technology. development that will benefit for--us for decades to come. Mr. Walker. Absolutely. Mr. Newhouse. So, thank you very much. Madam Chair, I yield back. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you. Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz? Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Thank you, Madam Chair. Assistant Secretary Winberg, the Office of Fossil Energy has launched a Coal FIRST Initiative, which I think has been alluded to here, to support research designs of the coal plant of the future, which seems like an oxymoron, and the request includes $172 million in fossil energy to support Coal FIRST. Let us consider these facts. In the U.S., electric- generating capacity from coal plants has declined by 25 percent in the last decade, and the Energy Information Administration expects coal-fired capacity to decrease another 46 percent by 2025. Globally, coal-fired energy will decrease 13 percent between now and 2050, according to the U.S. Energy Information administration at DOE, despite expected growth in overall electric generation. So, clearly, we are looking at a future without coal, or with certainly less coal, not more coal. So, it begs the question, is DOE starting a new billion- dollar research initiative for coal plants instead of focusing on the necessary technologies of the future, like renewables and energy storage? And why embark on Coal FIRST when you propose to cut EERE by 74 percent? It seems like you are investing in the past rather than the necessary future. Mr. Winberg. Thank you for the question. I think it is a response-rich question, and I will try and hold my answer down to 3\\1/2\\ minutes. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. I have another question. So, I appreciate that. Mr. Winberg. The fleet is aging. The coal fleet is aging, and there is no question about that. Part of DOE's responsibility is to look out over the horizon, and what happens if gas prices go to $5 or $6 or maybe $7? And we have been there before on a number of occasions. So, what we are proposing is a 21st century coal plant of the future. This is a plant that will have near zero or even zero emissions or, in some cases, negative emissions. And to your question why do it---- Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Right, but if I can interrupt you and ask you, for a moment, just to stick more closely to my question. I know what you are doing. I just do not understand why because you are dealing with a finite resource, as Mr. Pocan referenced, and you are proposing to cut, which we are not going to do, quite frankly. We did not do it last year. We are not going to do it this year. Why embark on Coal FIRST, when you are proposing to spend a billion dollars on a finite, old-school energy source that is not renewable instead of making sure that we can invest in renewable energy, that is less expensive and more plentiful going forward in the future? Mr. Winberg. Well, coal reserves in the United States are about 400 years. So, that might be finite, but it is pretty far out in the future. The second reason is that this is not a State problem. This is not a country problem. It is a global issue. If you want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and we have countries all over Asia, all over Africa, that are building coal-fired boilers. They are going to have a life of 40 or 50 years, and they are using 1970s vintage technology. So, what we are proposing is the coal plant of the 21st century because these communities, these countries, these regions will continue using coal for decades to come, and they are---- Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Thank you. Focusing on the United States' priorities, it makes a lot more sense over the long term to invest in renewable energy, not finite energy, in clean energy, not dirty energy. So, thank you for your response to my question. I want to follow up on the Plastics Innovation Challenge because it certainly seems promising, but I am concerned about the Department's partnership with the American Chemistry Council, whose members include several petrochemical companies. This partnership seems to represent an inherent conflict of interest. These are companies that profit from making more plastics. If we actually solve the plastics problem, we likely will put them out of business. That is certainly not in their interest. So, how is your partnership with them not a conflict? Mr. Simmons. So, the reason that we partner with them is because they are the manufacturers, and they have the knowledge about plastics and they understand plastics better than anyone else, currently. And so, to be able to make sure that we are advancing the state of the art to take today's bottles and to be--to do a much better job recycling them, not--I mean bottles. That is what is right in front of me, but there is plastics used for a lot of things, taking today's technology, but also to advance the state of the art, and what those---- Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Mr. Secretary, how can we ensure that these chemical producer partners are going to act in good faith during this challenge since it is not really in their interest? Mr. Simmons. We cannot. You know, we do not know how they are going to act. The Federal Government is focused on reducing the, you know, reducing plastic waste. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. So, you are not concerned about the fact that they could not act in good faith while--during your partnership and not make sure that we have plastics that are actually naturally renewable, as you referred to in your opening statement? Mr. Simmons. Obviously, cannot tell these companies what to do. We will work with whomever, you know, whoever we can work with to get the knowledge necessary to move to a better plastics future. I mean, that is our goal, is to be able to get the most knowledge that we can, so that we can do a better--so that we can do a better job with plastics. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Madam Chair, I would just suggest that as you prepare your mark, that we make sure that the Department has to consider whether the plastics industry actually is acting in good faith since they do not appear-- since they have acknowledged here today that they do not know. Ms. Kaptur. I thank you for your recommendation, Congresswoman. And we will now turn to Mr. Kilmer. Mr. Kilmer. Thanks, Madam Chair. Assistant Secretary Simmons, let me start with you. I mentioned to the Secretary last week that I appreciated you coming out to Sequim, WA, to the Marine Sciences Lab in person. Thank you for that. Having seen it firsthand, I know you recognize that it is a first- class asset and an important asset and a unique asset for the Department. As you know, the Water Power Technologies Office provides the single largest source of DOE funds to support the R&D efforts at the Marine Sciences Lab, which are a critical part of the--powering the Blue Economy Initiative, which is focused on new marine renewable energy technologies that can be helpful to remote communities and ocean-based industries. I am really grateful to the chair and the ranking member and this committee because they have shown support for that initiative in the last fiscal year. That resulted in a number of funding opportunities, including the ocean observing prize announced jointly with NOAA. Can you speak to that dual role that marine energy innovation can play in both developing new resources of clean energy while also improving our ocean observing capabilities, and how the R&D of these technologies led by the Marine Sciences Lab is critical to meeting DOE scientific and defense missions? Mr. Simmona. Sure. Thank you very much, I am grateful that I had the opportunity to get out to Sequim Bay and to see the lab and to see the work going on there. One of the things that I am excited about is the idea of the Powering the Blue Economy initiative. Because when you look at marine energy, it is incredibly difficult to think about wave or tidal energy competing in any significant way with wind or solar in the near term. And so what we are trying to do there is to look at new opportunities for these technologies so that we can get them deployed in some way and so that we can iterate on the technology and advance the technology because if what we have to do is to build a large device and to ship it to Hawaii, which is where there is a big wave device currently, actually there were issues transporting it to Hawaii and it was damaged. And so anyway, it is really challenging and so we are not getting a lot of learning by doing. With the Powering in the Blue economy and looking at ways to have for things such as sensors and floats and how do we use wave energy and the energy of the ocean to power those I think is a critical area and it is why I am very happy we are able to join with NOAA in putting together the ocean observing challenge, because it is very much what NOAA's mission does. And so the Marine Sciences Laboratory is a key piece to help us in that because they understand, well it is DOE's only marine laboratory and so they have a lot of capabilities. So there is, I think there is great opportunities there and looking at some non-traditional ways to think about marine energy that we haven't really thought about before by exploring all the opportunities, and as we are working to advance slowly the wave and tidal energy. I am sorry, I hope that answered your question. Mr. Kilmer. I think it is a terrific assets, and so we are constantly looking at how do we make sure that it is getting properly leveraged. So thank you for that. With the time I have left, Mr. Gates, I know some of my colleagues already asked about concerns around cyber security. I just want to get a sense from you, do you think that the department has the resources it needs from a financial standpoint, from a personnel standpoint, from an expertise standpoint, to fulfill its responsibilities of ensuring reliable and resilient energy infrastructure? Mr. Gates. Thank you for the question congressman. I believe the department is in the same place that many organizations that are concerned about cyber security are, they are competing for talent. They have plans, we have plans in a direction for acquiring more talent. I think we are well within the budget to be able to achieve our goals for having the workforce we need to accomplish our mission. But make no mistake, it is a competitive environment. Everyone has cyber security, all the agencies, all the partnerships we have, which are pretty good when it comes to organizations like CISA, organizations like FERC and NERC, people we are dealing with, organizations within the community who have the same care abouts we do. But I think we, within the existing budget will be able to achieve our goals when it comes to talent. What that does for the next 5 years, looking forward, looking at where cyber is across not only the energy sector but all others and what's happening in the universities, what's happening in the sector, it is going to be a very competitive environment and it is something we are keeping an eye on to make sure we have the talent we need to do the job. Mr. Kilmer. Thank you, Madam Chair, I yield back. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much, Congressman Kilmer. Assistant Secretary Simmons, in this area of climate change and significant agricultural losses, in October the department signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Agriculture to jointly increase, and I quote ``Energy, technology, development, and deployment'' for, and this is not in the actual memorandum, but for climate controlled and affordable energy for agricultural production across our country. I have advocated for this type of interdepartmental collaboration for years, and frankly I am relieved to see some progress here. But I am concerned that the working group's mission is rather broad and unfocused. So I wanted to ask a couple questions. What accomplishments have the interagency working group achieved since October? For example, the department's expertise in energy efficiency for industrial processes, lighting, and water systems, and energy and materials science, in particular, can benefit climate controlled greenhouses and 4 season production platforms. I think we have to move into that as a country in view of what's happening in different regions. How will the Department of Energy work with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to develop and deploy affordable technologies to produce in agriculture across our country under this Memorandum of Understanding? Mr. Simmons. I will talk about what we are doing, also the Office of Fossil Energy is also working with the USDA on this MOU, and so I will make sure to, if that is OK, to have Assistant Secretary Winberg also answer that question. So it is a rather new Memorandum of Understanding. One concern, we have not looked at anything around greenhouses yet. Some of the potential work we will do is on say photovoltaic solar and agriculture, how they can co-exist. Because currently a lot of PV solar is just you essentially bulldoze the field and put in solar panels. And what are the other opportunities that we can do to have to have some agricultural uses of that land? Also in areas with wastewater treatment. Because rural areas is very much what USDA works on and looking at improving wastewater treatment through increasing the energy efficiency, increasing the wastewater recovery of wastewater treatment facilities, particularly from small and medium sized facilities. You can do it here in the district, for example, at wastewater treatment at DC Water because it is gigantic, but being able to downsize those technologies to really help improve the economics of smaller scale wastewater treatment, hopefully we will be able to work with USDA on that. And I will let Assistant Secretary Winberg add any additional color from FE's perspective. Mr. Winberg. Thank you. The MOU that we signed, in fact next week we are going to be having, I think it is next week, maybe the week after, we are going to be having a joint workshop to look at power generation and agriculture needs. It is the energy/water nexus that we are focused on. And the USDA has a Natural Resources Conservation Service which has a budget of about $4.5 billion, and they work with private individuals looking at conserving water. So we have the power plants that might be in water restricted areas, and we are evaluating ways to reduce water consumption on those power plants so that we are not sacrificing irrigation for power or vice versa. And I think that the combination of DOE and agriculture is a good opportunity for us to share our knowledge, especially across those two vital areas, again, irrigation for agriculture and water for power. Ms. Kaptur. We are so happy to have your focus there. I think it is going to take both departments to really lead America forward in this really important arena. I come from a region of the country where because of our fresh water systems, we have had historic greenhouse industry production, oftentimes 43 percent of their bottom line is energy from traditional sources. And with a little material science and with a little thoughtfulness, I think you could get that way down. And you could provide a boost to American producers who are finding themselves facing more imported food for different reasons, particularly the fruit and vegetable sector. But I really think a blending of your knowledge on material science, energy science, water science, and the Department of Agriculture's abilities in production agriculture could be most interesting. There is just tremendous opportunity for 4 season production with inputs carefully controlled for the west, the dry west. It also has potential. When you talked about water conservation. But I think the envelope and the integration of systems is, I don't think we have had a revolution there in half a century, and it really could be a tremendous gift you could give the country if you could push that research. I also wanted to say in terms of methane digesters, many of our large animal facilities can't find a methane digester that doesn't break down. Department of Agriculture doesn't seem to be able to solve that problem. Maybe you could help them. But if you look at kind of the blending of agriculture and energy it is just ah. And I will just say this for the record because I have been around here a while. We actually, I was there when we wrote the first provision in an appropriation bill in the late 1990s to move the Department of Agriculture into fuels. They didn't want it. So you didn't exactly have, we wanted to add food, forestry, and fiber, so you could add a fourth F to your stool, it was going to be called fuel on. Now you can't take it away from them. So you can't exactly say they had vision themselves over there. But now it has become a very important element of our way of life. And frankly, didn't take that long when you look at some of the other things we are working on. So I just wanted to put that one on the table for you. And believe me, you have the interest of this member in your work in blending your dual capabilities as to a very important department to our country. I am going to let Mr. Simpson put in his question now. Mr. Simpson. Assistant Secretary Baranwal, HALEU Fuel is required to operate most types of advanced reactions under development in the United States, but no commercial source currently exists. This committee has prioritized a recovery of HALEU from spent nuclear fuel owned and managed by the Department of Energy at the Idaho National Lab. Additional recourses have been provided to scale at processing to a high enough rate to meet projected needs for first movers. Are there other steps the department can take to support these first movers while demand for commercial product materializes, and secondly, the recovered HALEU will still need to be converted into actual fuel for these reactors. What can the department and the INL do to help convert HALEU into fuel for first time movers and spur private sector development. Ms. Baranwal. Thank you for the question. Within the $12 million that is currently requested in the fiscal year 2021 budget for material recovery and waste form development, the top priority is accelerated recovery and downloading of EBR to spent fuel in support of the high-assay LEU supply for first movers. The objective is to provide up to 5 metric tons of fuel feed material by the year 2023. And it certainly is responsive to the expressed interest of private industry that has demonstrated and expressed an interest at this time for that type of fuel feed. Mr. Simpson. The budget request includes $295 million to continue development of a versatile test reactor which will operate as an open access user facility for DOE national labs. This type of research infrastructure is a critical part of the government's effort to facilitate the development of new nuclear technologies, as currently the only availability for civilian research is actually in Russia. Can you please discuss what the recently announced GE, Hatachi and Terra Power collaboration means for the versatile test reactor, both problematically and budgetary? And are there additional opportunities to work with the private sector or with international partners who also would benefit from a fast neutron test reactor? And are there other steps the department is taking to ensure timely project delivery? Ms. Baranwal. Yes. So in November of last year I announced an expression of interest for private/public partnership that you alluded to. GE, Hitachi, and Terra Power have been some of the entities that had applied to that expression of interest. Others have as well. And what we are doing at the moment is inviting those entities that have submitted to the EOI to submit for a request for proposal. So that is part one of your question. With respect to international interest, we actually did receive substantial international entity interest as well. At the moment though, we have collaboration agreements with the countries of Japan and France to work together on the VTR, and so we are looking forward to that as well as if there are other international collaboration opportunities we will certainly entertain those as they come along. And then you had a third part to your question. Mr. Simpson. The third part was are there other steps that the department, let me find it here. Ms. Baranwal. Was it on schedule, ensuring that we stick to a schedule. Mr. Simpson. Are there other steps the department is taking to ensure timely project deliver. Ms. Baranwal. Right. And so we do have periodic schedule reviews. There is actually an internal peer committee that does reviews to make sure that progress is being met on the projected schedule and budget, as well as lab director reviews. And so those are the types of mechanisms that we are using to ensure delivery on time. Mr. Simpson. OK, thank you. Assistant Secretary Walker, this is the fourth year in a row that the administration has proposed to sell the transmission assets of three Federal power marketing administrations and change the current cost-based rate structure for all 4 of the PMAs. By statute, the power marketing administration's market power generated at Federal hydropower dams, at the lowest possible rate to consumers consistent with sound business principles. This means rates are set to cover the cost of the initial Federal investment, ongoing operations and maintenance and interest. Since ratepayers are paying all costs already, why is the department proposing to change the rate structure? And is this an attempt to privatize the PMAs? Mr. Walker. I support the administration's position with regard to the potential sale of the PMAs, and as always will execute the will of Congress. We continue to evaluate and look at ways to provide best opportunity for customers, and we believe the sale of the PMAs may in fact do that. Mr. Simpson. Appreciate that. And I am not sitting here as one who is going to fight to the death to avoid that from happening. I would just like to know why there is a benefit to it, and if there is a benefit to it. And so far nobody has been able to tell us exactly what the benefit would be from privatizing the PMAs. So we will talk about that I am sure much in the future. Thank you, Chairwoman. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you, Mr. Simpson. Congressman Fleischmann. Mr. Fleischmann. Thank you, Madam Chair. I just have one further question. This is to Assistant Secretary Simmons on advanced manufacturing, sir. The Manufacturing Demonstration Facility at Oakridge National Laboratory is very successful, it is a public/private partnership for the rapid development of advanced manufacturing technologies. It is successful because it enables industry to access first of a kind manufacturing tools and systems, as well as staff with advanced manufacturing expertise. Companies that come through the MDF, and sometimes relocate near the MDF, have the desire to work side by side with these experts and leverage the lab's unique tools and systems to improve their products and productivity in ways that will revitalize and grow U.S. manufacturing. In a global economy that can be disrupted at any moment, it is more important now than ever that this type of research and development and deployment should receive strong support from DOE as well as Congress. My question, sir, is, what is the biggest obstacle to ensuring that the U.S. remains a leader in advanced manufacturing, and what more can be done through facilities like the MDF to provide opportunities for industry to directly engage the lab's experts and unique capability, sir? Mr. Simmons. We do manufacturing in the United States so that we continue to have manufacturing in the United States. And I realize that it sounds maybe like a bit of a tautology, but it is. A couple months ago I visited Florida to Jinko Solar, that has the new solar module manufacturing facility outside Jacksonville, Florida. And Jinko is the world's largest solar producer, they are based in China. One of the things that they said is that if this facility had been built in Asia they could have built it in a month. It sounded great that they had built this facility in six months in Florida, that sounded really fast. But it just goes to show you the manufacturing challenge of manufacturing in the United States versus Asia. And so we need to have advanced manufacturing that can be that responsive. Because they were able to build it that quickly in Asia because of lower labor standards and lower labor costs. And we are not going to change our labor standards, we are not going to reduce our worker safety standards so that we can do that. So it is critical that we acknowledge the technological edge and that we keep manufacturing so that we keep the people, the workforce, with the expertise. And one of the great things about being able to locate, to have a facility like the MDF is--and you have people locating around the MDF is you have a lot of knowledge and a lot of expertise, and so you have like a conglomeration economy so that the sum is greater than the individual parts. And the MDF is a great facility. Over 5,000 companies have visited the MDF. We will continue to fund the MDF as long as we are appropriated money because of advanced manufacturing is going to be the type of manufacturing that we have in the future in the United States, and it is critical that we keep it because once it is gone, it is very difficult to bring back. And the MDF is a great example of a bright spot in American manufacturing. One example that you see at the MDF is in terms of 3D printing, 3D printing in metals. And with people from the MDF, I have visited near Cincinnati the GE Additive facility. And one of the great things that you see there is a part of an engine, an airplane engine, I think this is a turbo prop engine, that was 300 pieces originally, 300 individual pieces, but now it is a single piece that is additively printed. So, being able to make sure that we have that knowledge in the United States is critical and the MDF is one key way to bring that knowledge and to keep it here. Mr. Fleischmann. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Madam Chair, I yield back. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you, Mr. Fleischmann. I wanted to turn to the subject for a second here on renewable energy jobs. Assistant Secretary Simmons, you mentioned--well, we have talked a little bit today about solar in panels, but solar voltaic installers are expected to be the fastest-growing occupation in the country this year with the median pay at nearly $43,000 a year. These are really good paying jobs. And wind turbine technicians are the second fastest occupation, think about that, with a median pay at over $54,000 a year. Clean energy jobs are on the rise fueling a new clean energy economy. However, your budget request eliminates programs like the Solar-Ready Vets Program designed to support this growing clean energy economy. At the same time, there is a skills gap. So, we need this workforce but there are not enough skilled people to fill these jobs. Given the skills gap, why is the Department proposing to eliminate important workforce programs? And what more can the Department do to train the workforce that is needed to fill these jobs? Mr. Simmons. EERE very much has a strong interest in developing and maintaining a strong and well-trained workforce. As I just mentioned in the answer to the previous question that one of the challenges, for example, that I saw in Florida, that Jenco Solar said, is just that in Asia they do not have to train their workers nearly as much as you need to in the United States for modular manufacturing because they come from other modular manufacturers currently and because we do not have very much solar modular manufacturing in the United States currently. That is some expertise that has been lost, but is-- hopefully, will come back some. We are preparing to launch in the next couple of weeks from funds appropriated for fiscal year 2020, a $20 million partnership to pursue leading-edge interdisciplinary, there we go, interdisciplinary research that promotes workforce development in emerging fields by supporting a coordinated expansion of existing joint graduate education programs with national laboratories for next generation scientist and engineers. The Department recognizes that the workforce of the future is very important and that is in the appropriated monies that we have, and we will continue to execute on that as appropriated. But the Department takes the workforce challenge seriously. Ms. Kaptur. So, I just wanted to point out to you that some of these positions are not Ph.Ds., but they are--they do require great skill. A lot of times veterans, just as the electric-generating companies, know not everybody can crawl up on a pole that, you know, 80 feet high, and the same is true with wind energy. And these are skills, manual skills that require a great deal of intelligence so you don't electrocute yourself, so you need training and workforce development. And it isn't just the Ph.Ds. doing some of the research into the future, but I hope that you focus on some of the capabilities that we have had before this very committee and make linkages there as well. We are talking about solar installers, we are talking about wind turbine installers. Imagine, the country doesn't have enough of them, and I am talking about thousands and thousands of jobs. So, I hope that your inquiry leads you there. Mr. Simmons. OK. Ms. Kaptur. And I am glad we have had this discussion. And I wanted to ask a question also on your hiring practices. The 2020 appropriation bill provides a significant increase to your program direction with the expectation that the office achieve a full-time equivalent staffing level of at least 675. I know you are making progress on that, but remain concerned that the Department is filling career positions with political appointees. Most recently, Assistant Secretary Simmons, you filled a senior level position in your office traditionally held by a highly qualified career civil servant with a political appointee who not only has very little relevant experience, but once advocated for the office's closure. Are you having difficulty finding qualified civil servants to fill your vacancies? And will you commit to me here that you will stop converting career positions to political positions? Mr. Simmons. The Department is focused on executing our mission, and it will always be a combination of career and political appointees to be able to carry that out. In all offices there are, around DOE, there are deputy assistant secretaries that are a mix of political and career. What matters is executing on the mission and putting together the team that can best achieve that, and that is what our goal is, that is what our goal is staffing. Ms. Kaptur. So, you are not prepared to commit to me today that you will not convert career positions to political positions? Mr. Simmons. Well, the challenge there is what is what is a political position versus a career position? I am not sure what the distinction is, so that is not something that I could commit to do until we understand that. Ms. Kaptur. Well, I ask you to follow up for the record. Mr. Simmons. Sure. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you. Congressman Simpson. Mr. Simpson. Thank you, just a couple more questions. Secretary Baranwal, as you know the Idaho National Laboratory recently launched a National Reactor Innovation Center, or NRIC, which will provide private sector technology developers support to accelerate the testing and demonstration of new nuclear systems for eventual licensing in commercialization. How will the Advanced Reactors Demonstration Program complement the work of NRIC? And how can NRIC help increase the impact of the demonstration programs in commercializing the next generation of advanced reactors? Outside of the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program, what role do you see NRIC in supporting reactor designs and designers? And how can NRIC and GAIN work together to support innovation and demonstration projects? That is a lot of questions. Ms. Baranwal. NRIC and GAIN are both very complementary, and they are coordinating their efforts to continue to support private industry. GAIN is certainly intended to provide private industry access to national lab capabilities with respect to technical expertise, testing facilities, regulatory assistance, and some financial assistance. NRIC is looking at the Federal infrastructure, including sites, facilities, materials, and expertise that would be needed to deploy advance reactor technologies. In its purview, it will be preparing the necessary safety safeguards, security, and environmental evaluations. So, all of those very much are required and will be needed by the private industry companies that will be demonstrating through the Advance Reactor Demo Program. Mr. Simpson. Thank you. Mr. Winberg, I got the feeling you wanted to kind of say a little more about the importance of fossil energy, but didn't get the chance to respond fully to those questions earlier. I won't say who or anything like that. Tell me, how much fossil fuel, what percentage of the electricity is produced by fossil fuel today? Mr. Winberg. About 80 percent of our overall energy. Mr. Simpson. Overall energy? Mr. Winberg. Which includes electricity. And transportation is fossil energy: coal, oil, and natural gas. Mr. Simpson. When do you expect to get that to zero? Mr. Winberg. Not in my lifetime, certainly, and probably not in my children's. IEA, under their best-case scenario will be down to about 75 percent globally, 75 percent fossil energy from 80 today; 75 percent by about 2050. Mr. Simpson. So, given that that is kind of the future, looking down the road, and that takes into account what we are doing with renewables and so forth and so on, would it not be important to develop new coal plants that are zero emission, if possible? Mr. Winberg. Yes, sir. I think it would make a lot of sense, both here in the United States as well as around the world. And not only can we make them zero emission, we can make them net negative CO2 emissions. If we burn, say, 80 percent coal and 20 percent biomass with 95 percent CCUS, they will be net negative CO2 emissions. Furthermore, we are going to take the next step and we are going to be looking at coal, biomass, and waste plastics to produce hydrogen because we need to deal with the transportation sector. And if we can do that, and we can do that on a net negative CO2 emissions producing hydrogen which can be used then for transportation, it can be used for power generation and it can be used in the industrial sector. Mr. Simpson. And just to clarify, when CO2 goes into the atmosphere, does it stay over the place it was produced or does it go around the world? Mr. Winberg. No, sir. It is caught up in the atmosphere and that is why it is a global challenge not just here. Mr. Simpson. So, emissions and what they are doing in China and India and other places that are building coal facilities is as important, actually, as it is in this country, too, right? Mr. Winberg. Yes, sir, perhaps more important as it relates to CO2 emissions. Mr. Simpson. Thank you, and thank you all for being here today. Mr. Gates, I didn't ask you any questions because I am so confused on what we have to do with cyber security, and I want to come down to your facility and sit down, I know some of this stuff is classified, but go through where we are and what we can do to ensure the cyber security of this country in the future, and the electrical grid. Because, as I said earlier, I am almost more worried about that than I am of other things. So, I appreciate all that all of you do, and you should know that a lot of times people think of national security as our defense and that kind of stuff, well, everything you do in national security to make us energy independent, to make our grid secure, to develop new technologies, and so forth; to make sure that the nuclear reactors and so forth of the future are actually American designed with the safety that we put into them. Everything you do is as important to national defense as defense is. So, I appreciate all you do; and thank you all. Ms. Kaptur. I want to thank the ranking member for his remarks, and I endorse them. And I also want to thank Congressman Fleischmann for remaining with us here. I just have a couple of final questions. Assistant Secretary Winberg, you talked about a hydrogen future in transportation, and you hit the key on my piano for sure on that one. So, if I wanted to see the future in our country of hydrogen in transportation, which geographic location would you direct me to? Anything come to mind? Mr. Winberg. No, I don't think anything comes to mind as it relates to hydrogen because hydrogen can be produced through electrolysis using the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Plant. It can be produced from natural gas, through national gas reforming with CCUS, and it can be used from coal. So, what that suggests to me is that around the United States, across the United States, we can produce hydrogen, maybe do it in a reasonably distributed manner, so that we are not centralizing our hydrogen production and then transporting it out to the areas that need it. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much. I also wanted to ask you that your budget request cuts research for carbon capture, utilization, and storage by nearly $100 million, and I wanted to ask you what do you think is the potential for carbon utilization technologies and how you justify the proposed cuts to these accounts? FYI, the University of Toledo in my home community is developing technologies for algae systems that capture and reuse carbon dioxide to produce renewal materials. Mr. Winberg. Thank you for the question. We are going to have about $123 million in our budget request for CCUS, and that is going to allow us to do, again, some of the early-stage research because the technologies are out there to capture carbon. What we need to do is get that cost down, and we have a goal at the Department of Energy to reduce it down to about $30 a ton from notionally $45 or $50 where it is at right now. We also have 45Q, and the Internal Revenue Service is writing regulations finalizing that. We are going to see demonstration projects come out of 45Q that will be commercial- scale done by private industry, and when that happens, that is when the learning really begins. The Federal Government can move back and allow industry to do what it does best, and that is to innovate. So, I think, there are great opportunities for CCUS. We have done some work in algae because it is a means of sequestering CO2 and you can turn it into a fuel or into a fertilizer, different uses for algae. In fact, we have currently got about $4\\1/2\\ million worth of projects going on. We just released a funding opportunity announcement and we are reviewing those now. I don't know if the University of Toledo participated in that, and if they did, it would be procurement sensitive, so I couldn't talk about it. But there are opportunities, clearly, for algae to be used in the transportation sector and also as a sequestration measure for CO2. Mr. Simmons. The University of Toledo project was funded by the Bioenergy Technologies Office. Just a note of clarification that the Office of Fossil Energy and EERE work together in this area, as well as making sure that we are keeping the aperture wide open in terms of carbon utilization. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much. I know my colleagues know, you have heard me talk about algae a lot, but if you lived in the southernmost of the Great Lakes and you see what it does, my question really is, are we producing it anew or are we using what is already there? I don't know if there is a harvesting mechanism yet, but that gets into a much larger conundrum as one tries to solve the problem in the watershed that produces the algae in the end. And with climate change and so forth, it is just a new stew we are facing all over the country. On the Everglades where we live, I think even in Idaho, Montana, we have had real issues. I know up in Green Bay, I guess that is why it has the name Green Bay, but up in Wisconsin, but we really do need---- Mr. Simpson. Is that why it is called Green Bay? Ms. Kaptur. I think so. I think so, but it never was quite this much. So, we have real challenges there, especially when part of it becomes toxic and it enters your fresh water systems. That is really a very dangerous moment. Finally, last question, and I thank my colleagues, Assistant Secretary Simmons, the administration has chosen to eliminate the weatherization and State energy program that helps individuals across our country save on energy costs, particularly those who have limited incomes and are elderly. And with states across the country facing budget pressures, who do you believe should pay for these if not the Federal Government? And the Department's coordination with other Federal agencies is crucial. At the ground, grantees do not know the difference between the colors of funds. So, can you elaborate on ways in which local weatherization grantees are leveraging weatherization funding with other related Federal programs? One of the things I learned, which was just astounding to me, in going to some of our announcements for the weatherization program is that your Department, through the states, fund magnificent retrofits of furnaces. They have these inventions where you can see where the cold air is coming from, or the hot air, into a home, but there is no coordination with HUD. So, if you fix the furnace and the roof leaks, it still isn't a perfect solution. And so, I found the need for collaboration huge, and some States do a good job, some States don't do a good job. And this is a real need across our country as some of this housing stock ages. It is still good stock. We need to fix it. Not everybody wants to live in a brand new house with no basement. And we have some phenomenal work going on sort of south of where Mike lives in the western part of the country where we have got net-zero homes being built in Arizona. I think that is so exciting. The construction industry has responded, too, but the necessity to kind of coordinate a little bit the energy agencies and housing agencies wouldn't be a bad idea and to try to do the whole unit at once and I think there needs to be a little bit more rigor there. So I know your budget has basically eliminated it. I hope that we are able to change that as we move the bill forward. Did you want to make any comments on weatherization? Mr. Simmons. Well, what I will say about weatherization is that the--that the zeroing is out is not a reflection of the importance of the program. It is a reflection of it is a State program, the theory is that it should be then funded by the States and that it could then maybe reflect some local circumstances better. So that's the theory of the budget. As you have, as you have seen over the past few years, we will work very hard and are weatherization office works very hard to execute on the monies appropriated to being able to make sure that the weatherization money gets out on time as well as the State Energy Program money gets out on time. It is a, as you noted, some states, some do better than others at being able to bring together and to do more innovative projects. I visited in November I went to Madison, WI to Representative Pocan's district and saw some weatherization work going on there and that the Wisconsin does really quite a good job in terms of bringing together different sources of funding to be able to make larger improvements for each project that they work on so that is, it's great to see. Mr. Simpson. Will the gentlelady yield for just a minute? Ms. Kaptur. I would be more than pleased to the gentleman. Mr. Simpson. I agree with you. I think zeroing out the weatherization program is a big mistake. But you know who pays for it, pays a lot of the costs in the Pacific Northwest? The Bonneville Power Administration of power marketing agency that this budget proposes to I think privatize. That is where a lot of the money comes from for the weatherization programs. And I have gone to a lot of different homes where they have done just what you have said, I mean, they do their whole home. They go in and they do that thing you said with the walls to see where the, everything is coming from and see if there is leaks and other stuff. They go downstairs to look and look at the amount of insulation and everything else and they do amazing, amazing stuff. And over a period of time that is energy saved is energy you don't have to produce. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much for those comments, Congressman Simpson. I urge you to be creative. We provided some language in the bill for 2020 to look at retrofit of entire neighborhoods, not just individual homes were you could have offsite solar, where you could use geothermal. We would leave it up to the creativity of the experts and that is really where DOE has an advantage over many of the states because the states don't really do research. Those devices that they have developed, the fans, the measuring devices that is a little bit high tech for states to do and I would expect that we have other innovations that could come that could help at the local level. Don't underestimate your own capabilities to help these States. You have moved America forward, you have weatherized millions of homes, you have saved them for the next generation. That is a big deal for people across this country, particularly those who can't afford to do it themselves. So, Congressman, Simpson, do you have any other questions for the record? We want to thank our witnesses very, very much. This concludes this afternoon's hearing. I again want to express my sincere thanks for all the effort that you devote to the people of this country and to its future and I ask the witnesses to please ensure for the hearing record that questions for the record and any supporting information requested by the subcommittee are delivered in final form to us no later than three weeks from the time you receive them. Members who have additional questions for the record will have until the close of business this Friday to provide them to the committee office. We thank all of our guests in the audience for your patience and interest. This hearing is adjourned. [Information submitted for the record follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE FORMAT] [GRAPHIC(S) FORMAT] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Wednesday, March 4, 2020 NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY AGENCY WITNESSES HON. LISA E. GORDON-HAGERTY, UNDER SECRETARY, NUCLEAR SECURITY AND ADMINISTRATOR, NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION DR. CHARLES VERDON, DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR, DEFENSE PROGRAMS, NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION DR. BRENT PARK, DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR, DEFENSE NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION, NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION ADMIRAL JAMES ``FRANK'' CALDWELL, DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR, OFFICE OF NAVAL REACTORS, NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION Ms. Kaptur. The subcommittee will come to order. Administrator Gordon-Hagerty, I want to thank you and your team for being here today and for all the extra effort you make to inform our members. We continue our budget hearings with the Department of Energy's fiscal year 2021 request for the National Nuclear Security Administration. The NNSA and its workforce are responsible for the consequential mission of ensuring the safety, security, and effectiveness of our Nation's nuclear deterrent. This includes nonproliferation activities and powering the Navy's nuclear ships and submarines. I cannot overstate the enormity of this mission. I know that each of you here today feel that weighty responsibility. I want to take a moment to recognize two important milestones. Twenty years ago, Congress created the NNSA. This year also marks the 25th anniversary of the science-based Stockpile Stewardship Program, which gives us confidence in nuclear deterrent without underground testing and allows for a reduced stockpile size. I want to be clear: Maintaining a safe, credible, and reliable nuclear deterrent is a national priority. But we must do so in a cost-effective, responsible manner, and this budget request does neither. I have serious concerns about this request. At this very hearing last year, I warned that the increases proposed then were not sustainable year after year. And yet the administration has doubled down on its unrealistic request, proposing to grow the 12 percent increase in fiscal year 2020 to 25 percent in 2021. I said that correctly, a 25 percent increase. To put it plainly, this budget is neither realistic or executable. It is based upon overly optimistic assumptions. In fact, I am becoming more convinced that Congress could write a blank check and NNSA still would not be able to deliver on its budget and schedule commitments. In analyzing the budget justification documents, which were shared with us only hours before the Secretary testified last week, it is clear NNSA is trying to do far too much, too quickly. Past precedent tells us that when we try to go too fast and don't do the upfront planning, NNSA makes costly mistakes. The fact of the matter is that nuclear deterrence is too important to get wrong. We don't have an unlimited defense budget, and as such, the answer cannot be limitless funding. Making budgets requires making strategic choices. Turning to nonproliferation, deterrence and diplomacy are complementary. The Department's nuclear nonproliferation programs have been a cornerstone of our efforts to prevent nuclear material from getting into the wrong hands, both internationally and at home. Yet this budget request proposes cuts to the Global Material Security program that is so vital to these efforts. In addition to rectifying this, I also believe that we need to take a fresh look at emerging threats as nuclear technologies evolve and as nations try to acquire them. The NNSA makes up a sizable portion of this subcommittee's bill. As such, we have a solemn obligation to the taxpayers to ensure that limited Federal resources are provided as part of a balanced, coherent strategy. Again, thank you for your service to our Nation and for being here today. With that, I will close my remarks and turn to our ranking member, Mr. Simpson, for his opening remarks. [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Simpson. Thank you, Chairwoman Kaptur. I would like to welcome our witnesses here today to this hearing. It is a distinguished and knowledgeable panel with whom we have had a good discussion in previous hearings. Thank you all for being here today. I look forward to hearing from you on the fiscal year 2021 budget request for the NNSA. The President's budget request for the Department of Energy shows a strong commitment to enhancing our U.S. national security. The request for the NNSA is just under $19.8 billion. This funding will advance the modernization of the nuclear weapon stockpile and its supporting infrastructure, prevent, counter, and respond to nuclear proliferation and terrorism threats, and to support the Navy's nuclear propulsion needs. I know there have been some concerns expressed about the increased request for the Weapons Activities account. But one thing we need to keep in mind also is why we are where we are today. After the end of the Cold War, many thought the need for a credible nuclear deterrent was gone or at least reduced, so many of the programs related to our nuclear weapons stockpile were reduced or eliminated. That may have been correct at the time, but today we know other nations are seeking to advance their nuclear capabilities. To appropriately respond to these evolving and emerging threats, we must continue the modernization of the stockpile and its supporting infrastructure. To do so requires reestablishment of many critical capabilities in an expeditious manner and a continued effort to make advancements through science and technology. These activities will require a full and capable workforce. The budget request is in support of these requirements. Many of these programs are by necessity ambitious and will require sustained attention to good program and project management. I believe the NNSA leadership assembled here with us today is up to the task. I look forward to today's discussion on the importance of your work and how the budget request will strengthen our national security. Chairwoman Kaptur, thank you for calling this hearing. I yield back. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you, Mr. Simpson. And before we turn to our witnesses today, I want to remind our members that we will follow our usual order for questioning. I also want to note that today I will be deferring to Mr. Visclosky for the first round of questions as he has joined us briefly before he must chair his own hearing in the Defense Subcommittee. I am pleased to have our witnesses here today. We will hear from the Honorable Lisa E. Gordon-Hagerty, who is the Under Secretary for Nuclear Security and Administrator for NNSA. Administrator Gordon-Hagerty is responsible for the Nation's nuclear security enterprise, and she has more than 30 years of experience in nuclear security. She has served in private industry and has held positions on the White House National Security Council and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. We will then hear from Admiral James F. Caldwell, who is the Deputy Administrator for the Office of Naval Reactors. Admiral Caldwell is responsible for managing NNSA's Nuclear Propulsion Program. Admiral Caldwell's sea tours include service in both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets and multiple operational assignments. Thank you all for being here today. Without objection, your written testimony will be entered into the record. Please feel free to summarize your remarks to approximately 5 minutes. Ms. Gordon-Hagerty, thank you for being here. STATEMENT OF HON. LISA E. GORDON-HAGERTY Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. Chairman Kaptur, Ranking Member Simpson, and members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to present the President's fiscal year 2021 budget request for the Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration. As always, it is a privilege to sit before you today representing the fine men and women of the NNSA. We are grateful for your demonstrated strong bipartisan support for the NNSA's national security missions and the people that execute them every single day. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the NNSA's establishment by Congress--although, of course, our heritage goes back much further, to the Manhattan Project and to the Atomic Energy Commission. And as always has been the case since the Nuclear Security Enterprise's creation, the effectiveness and credibility of America's nuclear capabilities reassures our friends and allies and serves as the ultimate deterrent against a nuclear attack by those who wish to harm us. In this regard, NNSA serves a unique role in supporting our Nation's national security. The $19.8 billion budget request for NNSA reflects President Trump's strong commitment to ensuring America has a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent for decades to come. This funding also affirms the administration's continued work to reduce threats posed by nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism, as well as providing militarily effective nuclear propulsion for the United States Navy's fleet of aircraft carriers and submarines. The Weapons Activities request of $15.6 billion will allow us to modernize the Nation's nuclear stockpile and infrastructure and meet national security requirements after decades of neglect. It will modernize the stockpile with five weapons modernization programs, execute stockpile sustainment activities, conduct annual assessments for all weapon systems. And with this request, we will continue the dismantlement and disposition of weapons and components from the weapons retired from our stockpile and support production modernization activities for nonnuclear components and strategic materials, including a two-site plutonium pit production strategy. We will also continue to recapitalize NNSA's aging infrastructure, including the Y-12 Uranium Processing Facility and the Idaho Spent Fuel Handling Facility. As many of you have witnessed firsthand, our entire enterprise continues to age, with much of our infrastructure operating far beyond its design life. With this increase, we will finally be able to modernize the enterprise. Our defense nuclear nonproliferation request of $2 billion marks the third year in row that the Trump administration has sought an increase in funding for NNSA's nonproliferation and counterterrorism programs and fully funds DNN priority program requirements. This reflects the administration's strong commitment to reducing global nuclear threats and to arms control efforts that advance U.S., allied, and partner security. It will enable us to continue to build domestic and international capacity to secure and, where possible, eliminate nuclear and radioactive materials and prevent nuclear smuggling. Further, this request allows us to maintain a robust nuclear counterterrorism capability to respond to nuclear and radiological threats, including nuclear forensic activities to attribute the source of material used in a terrorist attack. We will advance our capabilities for detecting and monitoring foreign nuclear material and weapon production activities. Equally important is the Naval Reactors budget request of $1.7 billion. It enables us to provide for the continued safe, reliable, and long-lived operation of the U.S. Navy's nuclear fleet, which accounts for more than 40 percent of the Navy's major vessels. Finally, our Federal salaries and expenses budget of $454 million will allow us to recruit, train, and retain a highly skilled workforce of 1,858 Federal employees. Madam Chairwoman, it is true that our timeline for modernizing the nuclear stockpile and recapitalizing the necessary infrastructure is aggressive. In some cases, we are asking our sites and partners to do in 10 years what has traditionally taken 15 to 20 years. But in the 2 years since being confirmed, I have seen firsthand the Nuclear Security Enterprise workforce's passion and dedication and what we can accomplish. Consequently, while the schedule may be aggressive, I believe it is achievable. However, we can only do so with consistent and sustained funding and, most importantly, our continued partnership with Congress. I would also like to thank our NNSA Deputy Administrators, Dr. Charlie Verdon, Dr. Brent Park, and Admiral Frank Caldwell, for your leadership, dedication, and commitment to our enterprise and to our great Nation. Thank you again for your strong support and the subcommittee's strong support and the opportunity to testify before you today. I am ready to answer any questions you may have. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Gordon-Hagerty follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT IN TIFF FORMAT] Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much, Administrator Gordon- Hagerty. Admiral Caldwell. STATEMENT OF ADMIRAL JAMES CALDWELL Admiral Caldwell. Chairwoman Kaptur, Ranking Member Simpson, and distinguished members of this subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify here today. I also want to thank the subcommittee for consistently supporting Naval Reactors, enabling my team to provide the Navy with propulsion plants that give our nuclear-powered warships the incredible advantage of unmatched reliability, speed, and endurance to carry out the national security missions that they do around the world. Our National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategies recognize an increasingly dynamic and complex global security environment marked by the reemergence of great power competition. Nuclear propulsion remains critical to our national security posture. Today, over 40 percent of the Navy's major combatants are nuclear powered, including 11 aircraft carriers and 68 submarines. Naval Reactors' budget request for fiscal year 2021 is for $1.68 billion. That is an increase of $35 million, or 2.2 percent, from our fiscal year 2020 request. Our budget request supports three national priority projects. The first project supports the Navy's number one acquisition priority by developing the new propulsion plant for the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine, which will feature a life-of-ship reactor core. That core is made possible by reactor technologies developed over many decades. The fiscal year 2021 request will continue supporting oversight of lead ship propulsion plant design and safety analysis work. The second project is refueling and overhauling a land- based reactor in New York. There is a dual benefit to this effort: First, enabling continued research and development, and then providing 20 more years of training for new fleet operators. The project has been working through performance challenges associated with the integration of workforces from multiple shipyards. However, recent performance has shown improvement. The third project is constructing the new Naval Spent Fuel Handling Facility in Idaho, which will enable long-term reliable processing and packaging of spent nuclear fuel from Naval reactors plants. Market conditions, such as a shortage of skilled labor, high construction demand, and a remote location, coupled with price volatility for domestic construction materials, have resulted in higher than anticipated costs. However, we have taken action to minimize impacts to project costs and schedule. Congress' full support of this project has allowed us to make significant progress. Last year, we began construction activities, and later this year, we will begin pouring concrete backfill and foundations. This year's budget request also invests in three key areas: supporting today's nuclear fleet, developing advanced reactor technology for future classes of nuclear-powered warships, and modernizing critical infrastructure and reducing the program's legacy environmental liabilities. I want to assure the committee that our budget planning efforts are done with rigor. Although two of our major projects are facing challenges over the last year, I continue to pursue efficiencies to help offset cost increases and schedule changes that these projects have experienced. This puts pressure on other parts of my program, specifically in the areas of research and development, as well as facility recapitalization. However, I recognize the budget constraints this country faces, and I will continue to effectively manage the resources that Naval Reactors is allotted. I respectfully urge your support of our fiscal year 2021 budget request, and I thank this committee for their longstanding support of Naval Reactors. I look forward to answering your questions. Thank you, ma'am. [The prepared statement of Admiral Caldwell follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE TIFF FORMAT] [GRAPHIC(S) IN TIFF FORMAT] Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much, Admiral. Now, we are going to turn to our very able and long-serving member of the subcommittee, Congressman Peter Visclosky, who also chairs our Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. Mr. Visclosky. Madam Chair, Mr. Simpson, and the members of the Committee, I do appreciate the special consideration. There are five of us on this subcommittee that have another hearing on Defense. I do think the work you do is incredibly important. I have served on this committee since another century, and typically would ask questions, but just wanted to express some concerns as we proceed with the 2021 budget. I do believe our role is to make sure we have rigorous oversight, as obviously we are spending the taxpayers' dollars properly. My concern, first of all, is that according to the agency's fiscal year 2020 Stockpile Stewardship Management Plan, NNSA did not intend to ask for more than $15.5 billion for Weapons Activities until the early 2030s. Yet, this year you are seeking $15.6 billion for Weapons Activities, which represents an increase of over 25 percent from current year levels. I would also emphasize that I am highly skeptical that NNSA has the capacity to spend $15.6 billion in fiscal year 2021, given that the agency continues to sit on a very large sum of unobligated and uncosted balances. Second, I am always and have been concerned that you are on the receiving end from requests from the Department of Defense: We need it. We will supply. Well, maybe we have constraints in making that supply. The case in point is this year there is a $53 million request for NNSA to begin work on the new W93 warhead, a project that was previously not expected to begin until 2023. And we had a discussion with the United States Navy earlier today at the Defense Subcommittee on this. The NNSA recently completed the life extension program for the W76-1 warhead and is in the process of modernizing the W88 warhead for submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Given these efforts, it is unclear to me why we must begin funding the development of the W93 this year. Last month, as the US STRATCOM commander appeared before the Defense Subcommittee, in his written remarks expressed his concerns over the atrophy of our nuclear weapons-supporting infrastructure and resulting risks. Yet in spite of that risk, there appears to be no hesitation for another requirement to be added on to an atrophied infrastructure. The administration's insistence that the W93 warhead will not require a new design also gives me pause. In talking about infrastructure, it is my understanding that you have about $2.5 billion in deferred maintenance. I am a maintenance kind of guy. I am from Gary, IN. And my concern is whether or not we should take that on before embarking on other things that will stress that infrastructure. And the final point of policy is I have also always believed that it is less costly to spend money on nonproliferation to prevent the spread of materials and preventing other countries from securing them. This current administration is not the only violator of deemphasizing nonproliferation. It is very costly to build these weapons. And I just really wish we would strike a strong balance between nonproliferation as well as weapons development. Obviously, that is my personal observation. I just wanted to be allowed to make those observations. I do appreciate the indulgence. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much, Congressman Visclosky. And now we will turn to our very long-serving member on this subcommittee, Congressman Ken Calvert, who is the ranking member on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. Mr. Calvert. Thank you, and I appreciate your coming out here today. I think the modernization effort you are all spearheading is obviously a top priority for our 2021 budget request for the National Nuclear Security Administration. It comes in at $19.8 billion. It was mentioned, an almost 20 percent increase from the fiscal year 2020 amount. We are also aware of the tight--very tight--schedule that your systems are operating on in order to replace the nuclear triad. Given that there is very little margin or room for error on these programs, can you please give a quick rundown on whether the nuclear weapons piece of the following program is on time and your confidence level that they will be delivered as expected? The Ground Based Strategic Deterrent replacing the Minuteman III; two, the Columbia-class sub or the Ohio replacement; and three, the B-21 Bomber program. If you can go through this for us that would be great. Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. Mr. Calvert, I can address the GBSD or the 87-1 replacement. There have been some slippages in the FPU date, in the first production unit date, based on the fragility of our infrastructure, which I think is rightfully stated. Because of the fragility of our infrastructure, that we have let it to decay, we have allowed it to delay over the last 20 years, we are finding that we have a vendor base--a problem with our vendor base, and for the capacitors or from other components for the nuclear weapons stockpile. That certainly, we haven't needed them for 20 years, and now all of a sudden we are having this resurgence of five modernization programs, and we need these domestically produced or vendor-based products from here in the United States. To the extent we are working very closely with and continue to be aligned with every single program with the Navy and with the Air Force for our nuclear modernization programs, while the FPU will slip a bit, the IOC date is still the same, which means it will be delivered on target and on schedule with the United States Air Force. I would defer to Admiral Caldwell on the Ohio-class replacement and Columbia. Admiral Caldwell. Sir, regarding the Columbia, we are going to officially start construction this year in October. And the ship must deliver in 2028 and be to sea in 2031 for its first patrol. My responsibilities on the Columbia class are the design of the reactor plant, including the reactor core, the life-of-the- ship core, as well as the electric drive. Because of the great support that we have received from this subcommittee, I am on pace to support the needs of the Navy in constructing the Columbia class. In fact, last year I was able to order the reactor plant heavy equipment exactly on schedule. Those are the heavy components that go in the reactor plant. And this year I am starting construction of the reactor core, and I will be able to deliver that core within the required dates that the Navy needs it. On the Department of Navy side, I am funded to develop the integrated power system, or the E drive, which is an electric motor vice a steam propulsion turbine. And I have been able to actually build a prototypical motor and put that in a facility and start testing that motor and all the components in the integrated power system. And I am on track to support the Navy's needs in constructing the Columbia-class submarine. It takes a lot of work and a lot of oversight, and we are working hard with our industry partners to make sure we deliver. Thank you, sir. Mr. Calvert. Can you comment on that? Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. Sir, we can't comment on the B-21. However, I would like to mention something about it. I was referring to the 61-12 and the delay that we had in the 61-12 FPU, but the IOC is the same. The 87-1, which is the 78 replacement for the Minuteman III, is on target for an FPU date of 2030. So we are fully aligned with the Air Force for the 87-1. So my apologies for that. Mr. Calvert. Thank you. I guess I will hear from the B-21 Air Force. I yield back. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much. Madam Administrator, the fiscal year 2021 request for the Weapons Activities is $15.6 billion, a $3.1 billion increase above last year. Last year, NNSA said it would need $12.8 billion in fiscal year 2021 to meet its budget and schedule commitments. That should equate to a $350 million increase over what we appropriated last year. However, it leaves about $2.8 billion in this request that was unplanned as of this time last year. As I told Secretary Brouillette last week, this budget request is simply sprinting toward failure. We need to take steps to prevent that from happening and give NNSA more breathing room before falling off the cliff. The program scope has been known for years. What has changed since this time last year to result in such a request for such a large increase? Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. Madam Chairwoman, the fiscal year 2021 request was the result of a year-long activity that we undertook throughout the entire NNSA, with all our labs, plants, and site leadership, our field offices, and our headquarters leadership. And we looked at every single priority that has been given to us by the Department of Defense and those internal to us for nonproliferation and counterterrorism activities. And we took a very hard line on what these priorities were across the entire integrated NNSA. This is kind of somewhat of a unprecedented activity for us. In fact, this year, we are going to be looking at a zero- based budget requirement. We believe that it is important to spend the taxpayer dollars wisely. When we uncovered this and we looked at the five modernization programs, especially in the Weapons Activities area, we realized that after decades of neglect of our enterprise it was time that we received the necessary, the critical resources to upgrade our infrastructure and modernize our entire nuclear enterprise. We have facilities that are nearing 70 years old in which we are operating. More than 30 percent of the facilities across NNSA enterprise--more than 30 percent--are over 70 years old. More than 40 percent are over 50 years old. We are working through those facilities in the best possible way. And to the point of where we are throwing good money after bad, that is why it is time to modernize our infrastructure and recapitalize and reconstitute the nuclear security enterprise. It is because we haven't paid intention to it. Perhaps call it the peace dividend, call it what you will. But we have lost vendor capacity. We have lost our personnel. We are on a massive corporate approach to hiring. I am glad to say that we have hired 7,700 people across our nuclear security enterprise to date this year, through the end of fiscal year 2019. We lost much of that project management program, program management, laboratory scientific expertise at our three laboratories and our weapons plants and sites, and now we need to reconstitute and recapitalize that. We are at a tipping point. Even GAO yesterday in their testimony, I had the pleasure to testify before the House Armed Services Committee, and GAO even expressed their concern about doing this. They were cautious--my words--cautiously optimistic. They were questioning whether or not we could do it. Yes, we are asking. We are seeking to do things in 10 years that traditionally would take 15 to 20 because we work in the nuclear weapons complex. That is not building homes, with all due respect. That is building nuclear grade facilities. And we are constructing those and working for a modern, resilient enterprise. And the foundation of this goes to our nuclear deterrent, because the Department of Defense sets the requirements. But it is the NNSA that maintains the nuclear weapons stockpile, thus our national security for our Nation. And that is what we are seeking, is the 2021 budget request of $19.8 billion is to do just that, is to preserve our nuclear deterrent. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you, Madam Administrator. You know, you may have a very good strategic plan in place, but I don't believe that it actually is a realistic annual request. But I think the effort to put forward an overall number may be a very useful exercise, and I congratulate you for doing that. But, again, I think that there are some dangers in the type of proposal that you have submitted to date. I wanted to ask one other question, then we will turn to the ranking member. The request also includes a 77 percent increase above last year to support activities to produce new plutonium pits for warheads. Our fiscal year 2019 bill required NNSA to deliver a plan that includes the scope of work, costs, schedule required to meet its pit production target, and we are still waiting. So when, specifically, will you deliver this plan to us? Please know, without a plan, we have nothing to evaluate this request against. Why should we give NNSA additional funding for these efforts when it is not clear that you even have a plan? Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. Ma'am, we have a plan. We are working through it right now. It is in its final draft stages. And I have been assured that it will be on my desk shortly and then delivered to Congress soon thereafter. Ms. Kaptur. Do you have a target date? Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. Soon. I have made it our number one priority with defense programs to ensure that it comes to my desk very, very soon. Ms. Kaptur. Are we talking 3 months, 6 months? Mr. Verdon. It is in the concurrence process now, ma'am. So it is just when the people that have to do the concurrence process. Ms. Kaptur. How many people does that have to go through, Doctor? Mr. Verdon. It is at least three additional organizations before it comes back to the Administrator. Ms. Kaptur. All right. So we are talking several months. Mr. Verdon. We will gladly come up to brief. We will offer that. Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. In fact, that is a great idea. Thank you, Dr. Verdon. We would gladly brief you on our final draft plan, because, again, it is in concurrence, and we don't expect any significant changes to it because it is a plan drafted by defense programs. So those that are seeing it from the outside in, if you will, where it is currently in concurrence, shouldn't have any significant changes. Again, we will gladly brief you on that, if you would like. Ms. Kaptur. Again, you can understand, Madam Administrator, why we might be concerned about other requests that are far beyond the scope of what we believe can be realistically achieved. Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. Absolutely. Ms. Kaptur. I thank you very much. Thank you, Dr. Verdon as well. I would like now to turn to our ranking member, Mr. Simpson. Mr. Simpson. Thank you, Chairwoman. Madam Administrator, before I get into specifics of the budget request, I would like to start with why we are discussing an active program to begin with. I guess it is because of the neglect of the past that we are looking at this type of budget increase. Could you please describe the impacts of our nuclear deterrent and national security of modernization programs don't happen? And are there budgetary impacts for either the NNSA or DOD if NNSA's schedule is delayed? Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. Mr. Simpson, I am glad you recognize that after years of neglect--after decades of neglect--we find ourselves in the untenable position of trying to modernize and recapitalize our entire infrastructure while working on five major modernization programs as directed by the Department of Defense. So, yes, it is a challenge for us. And we are absolutely aligned right now with the Department of Defense, and we are working very closely with the Air Force and with the Navy, who drive the requirements for our major modernization programs. If we slip on our schedule, then that requires then slippage for the Air Force or for the Navy, which means now we are touching the deterrent and we are actually making decisions on what the deterrent's capabilities and capacities will be. And we rely foundationally on a strong strategic deterrent. And so if we continue to slip to the right, so to speak, then what does that say to our allies and to our partners and, equally important to our adversaries, about the capability, quality of our nuclear deterrent? So, yes, it has profound changes. And, also, it is going to cost even more if we continue to slip the modernization programs that are necessary for our Nuclear Security Enterprise. Mr. Simpson. Thank you. I have been in some of those buildings, and I don't know that I would like to work in some of those that have been around for 70 or so years. They are risky, to say the least, especially when you are doing nuclear work. Mr. Visclosky mentioned the uncosted balances in his comments. NNSA has significant uncosted balances from prior years. Sometimes these carryover balances are planned, as with capital equipment procurement and construction projects where appropriations are needed to begin the activity, but dollars are often spent slowly over a period of time or even not until towards the end of the activity. Other times, uncosted balances can show trouble in executing the program as planned or even simply cost excess funds. What proportion of NNSA's uncosted balances is obligated due to activities like capital equipment, procurement, and construction? And do these proportions vary from program to program, specifically, weapons and nonproliferation? And for the record, can you please provide how NNSA's carryover compares with other Federal agencies? Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. OK. Thank you. NNSA has worked significantly to minimize our carryovers, and we continue to make sure that this process is transparent with Members of Congress. I am pleased to report that at the end of fiscal year 2019, NNSA had a net funds carryover of $637 million out of a $15 billion budget. That is equal to or below that of other Federal agencies and departments. And just as GAO said yesterday in our hearing, they believe that it was consistent with that and it was appropriate to have that kind of carryover. In fiscal year 2019, we did have $8 billion of carryover. And despite that massive number, that is reasonable for NNSA in executing a $100 billion program over 5 years. GAO again had stated that that was appropriate. And while, for example, Naval Reactors has a 46 percent carryover, which is considered efficient, NNSA has a 49 percent carryover efficiency. And, again, if you look across the Federal Governments and agencies, we have seen a chart recently that shows NNSA is equal to or below most other Federal agencies. Mr. Simpson. Thank you. Admiral Caldwell, let me ask you, I understand that Naval Reactors is the Advanced Test Reactors' largest customer. How does the ATR support the Navy's mission? And as you are aware, ATR is aging and experiencing infrastructure deficiencies. How does this impact your research and development efforts? Admiral Caldwell. Thank you for the question, sir. The Advanced Test Reactor is absolutely vital to Naval Reactors' responsibilities. Over many decades, we have been able to take fuel that--materials that we want to understand how they would perform in a radiation, in a field in a flux, and evaluate them in the Advanced Test Reactor. This reactor has allowed us to make significant advances in the life of our reactor cores. For example, Nautilus was refueled at about the 18- to 24-month period, and now we are talking about building Columbia, which will have life-of-ship core over 40 years. That would not have been possible without the Advanced Test Reactor. So we are very much involved with it, and we are very much interested in making sure we have that capability as a Nation. That said, we are involved with DOE-NE to make sure that we have a plan to maintain the current systems. And we are on a 5- year rolling maintenance plan that is designed to go repair and modernize and fix some of the support systems. That said, we are still not executing to the amount of operational days that I need. And we are also thinking about the future. We are looking to see if the Advanced Test Reactor can have its service life extended out to the year 2085. That analysis work is being done in conjunction with my team, and we will have an answer in the 2022 or 2023 timeframe. But that all said, we need that capability. If we are going to continue to develop these advanced cores for the Navy, I need to be able to test in something like the Advanced Test Reactor. Mr. Simpson. Thank you. And if anybody thinks that refueling one of these submarines is a simple project of just carrying the rods down putting them in, go up to Groton. It is an amazing process that they go through to refuel one of these submarines. I can't believe that--or I can believe the savings that will come from not having to refuel these when you have life-of-the-ship reactors. Admiral Caldwell. That is correct, sir. In fact, with the Columbia program, we are going to be able to do the mission with 12 submarines versus the current 14 in the Trident force. That will save the Nation on the order of $40 billion over the life of the program. Mr. Simpson. Thank you. Ms. Kaptur. Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Thank you, Madam Chair. Administrator, I know you are aware that your budget request includes a Future Years Nuclear Security Program, and that provides a guidepost for Congress' future budget--for the future budget request that we can expect from you. In fiscal year 2020, your budget request told us that the NNSA outyear budget estimates were fully consistent with the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review. But fiscal year 2021, as we have been discussing this afternoon, you are requesting $2.8 billion above the amount you expected to request, according to the fiscal year 2020 budget plan. I understand that the infrastructure is aging, that it is important for us to keep competitive, and that was your response. But just last week, the Secretary of Energy testified that the proposed increase in the request would, quote, ``pull forward infrastructure projects.'' What specific infrastructure projects would be pulled forward with this increase? And why should the subcommittee pull forward any work at all when NNSA can't even keep pace with your current work? Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. Representative Wasserman Schultz I would say that we are on time and on budget with all of our work, in our workload and our construction. In fact. I can use UPF, which is our Uranium Processing Facility at Y-12, which has remained on budget and on schedule for 7 years in a row. That facility will be $6.5 billion and completed by the end of 2025. That is huge major capital construction---- Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Reclaiming my time for a moment. Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. OK. So to your question, we looked at-- we worked with our labs, plants, and sites and looked at the highest priorities and prioritized all the missions that we must execute in 2021 and beyond. And in order to have the--to receive that uplift and to work across the entire enterprise, our Tritium Finishing Facility request will be pulled to the left. Tritium is a critical strategic material needed in nuclear weapons. We have a facility in which we are operating that is over 60 years old. That is a single point of failure. We can speak in classified terms in numbers about what happens to the stockpile if we lose our Tritium capability. And that also goes with other strategic materials, such as the Lithium Processing Facility at Y-12. We need to move these facilities to the left. We have had these planned for decades, and they continue to slip. It is time we finally revitalized and recapitalized our infrastructure. So those are just two examples. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Thank you. But it seems that NNSA and DOE were not really on the same page and using different assumptions to build your budget request, I don't understand why that is the case. The Secretary's preferred number for NNSA in an attempt-- was that an attempt by the Department to prioritize NNSA's workload because the agency right now appears to them to have its hands full? You had a large discrepancy between his preferred number and what ended up in the budget request. It really appeared that you outmaneuvered your own Secretary in pursuit of an unrealistic, wildly fantastical number. I get that we have to catch up and we certainly need to make sure that we keep our national security needs paramount. But you can't catch up for 30 years in 5 years. That is just not possible. We deal with finite budget authority in the appropriations process. NNSA doesn't have the capacity to deal with the funds that you have requested. We have other priorities, and NNSA can't just suck up all the money. So I really don't understand how you ended up with a, as has been expressed on both sides, the concern expressed on both sides, a much larger number than you seem to have the capacity to spend and that we have the capacity to appropriate for you. Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. Representative, all I can say is that I have been through the labs, plants, and sites, our field offices and I know that we can---- Ms. Wasserman Schultz. No, no, no, I know that, except that---- Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. I am betting on our infrastructure and our personnel. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Reclaiming my time because I want you to answer my question. I have heard you go on about what is so important about this. I understand it is important. But your Secretary of your Department had a preferred number for NNSA, and you appear to have outmaneuvered him and gotten a larger number. And that discrepancy is very clear, that you don't have the capacity to spend the funds even if we appropriated every dollar to you. You can't possibly expect us to give you that much money in this small part of the budget and be able to deal with the other priorities that we have to deal with. Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. So to the extent the executive branch went through our processes, they were respectful processes, and we followed the President's direction of his number one priority, which is modernizing the nuclear triad. And the request that we asked for---- Ms. Wasserman Schultz. You went up the chain? Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. Pardon me? Ms. Wasserman Schultz. You went straight up the chain? Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. No, ma'am, I did not. I worked through the regular process internally. And our internal executive branch discussions are just that. And we worked very closely with the Secretary of Energy to explain our position. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. OK. That is not the information that I have. OK. Thank you. I yield back. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you. Congressman Newhouse. Mr. Newhouse. Thank you, Madam Chair. And welcome to all of you. I appreciate you being here this afternoon with us. I had a particular question for you, Administrator Gordon- Hagerty, as well as Dr. Park. As you know, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is in my district, and they are a leader in protecting against the threats of nuclear proliferation. We talked about that just a little bit prior to the hearing. So I was pleased to see the strong investment in your budget as it relates to the Nonproliferation Stewardship Program. Probably most of my colleagues are very familiar with the Stockpile Stewardship Program. But could you share with us the role of the Nonproliferation Stewardship Program and how, in your estimation, that this program is going to help us maintain our ability to deter proliferation in this modern age? Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. Thank you, Representative Newhouse. Let me say, I am very pleased to report, as I mentioned in my opening statement, that that is the third year in a row that the Trump administration has sought additional and increased budgets for our nuclear nonproliferation program. We are very pleased with it. It is complementary to and supported by our Defense Program's activities. I would be delighted to turn to Dr. Park and give you some ideas about some of the activities that we have ongoing in the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation program. Mr. Newhouse. Thank you. Mr. Park. Thank you for that question. And more than anything else, I truly appreciate all of your constant, continued support for the nonproliferation program. So thank you so much for that. PNNL is a critical component, a critical member of our national lab response team. And going back to your question about the nonproliferation stewardship activities, it is about people. We need to focus on training the next generation of people, and this program will allow that. We need to actually have a program that is sustainable and steady state. And we will pursue a couple of large initiatives that will involve the PNNL, along with the Los Alamos and Plutonium Science Institute. And although Mr. Fleischmann just left, we will pursue Uranium Science Institute with the Oak Ridge and the other laboratories. This is the bedrock for training next generation of people. And at the same time, it is not just empty training. They will get to do meaningful, mission-focused work. So they will get to have very classified information with which they can do research and develop new tools and to come up with the new technologies to do sample analyses. Hopefully, we will have a chance to talk on nuclear forensics. But, again, this is the cornerstone of how we train the next generation. So your support for this program is very much appreciated, and we are counting on it. Thank you. Mr. Newhouse. I appreciate you sharing that with us and critical to our efforts. Again, thank you all for being here with us this afternoon. I appreciate the frank testimony, the response to the questions, and I look forward to working with you as we move forward. Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you. Congresswoman Kirkpatrick. Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Thank you, Madam Chairman. Thank you, Administrator, for being here. And thank you to the panel all for being here today. I especially want to congratulate Dr. Verdon for choosing a great university for your doctorate, the University of Arizona in my hometown of Tucson. We are happy about that. I also have a concern about the unspent funding. And I know that you have got--you said you have got a plan to spend it. Do you also have a timeline that you can provide for us as to when that money is going to be spent down? Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. Absolutely. We do. And we have been sharing with the staffs of the subcommittees and the full committee, and we will continue to do so. But we are working judiciously to spend down those resources. I do want to make a point about spending on resources, though. While we have specific tasks for all of the defense program's related activities--for example, in the nonproliferation program--some of those carryovers that we see, those unexpected carryovers, some of the programs that we undertake, such as the most recent successful removal of 700 kilograms of highly enriched Uranium from the United Kingdom, took several years to accomplish. Once we sign an agreement with them--and that goes not only for the U.K., but all of the materials that we return or work with to secure around the world, are multi-year-faceted programs. You don't just sign an agreement and then bring the material back, much like you don't just refuel a submarine. It takes many years to put the plan together and to execute that mission, and then bring it back to the United States or secure it in place or take it to a third country. While we might receive the requests for resources, receive the budget, the appropriations in 1 year, we might have that over several years before we can expend it all. So in some cases there are--people view that as, well, those are unobligated, unspent resources, and there is nothing further from the case. The worst case would be is that we use those resources for something else and then at the critical time, when we want to bring the materials back or secure it, those resources aren't there, and then we have to come back to Congress for additional appropriations. And that is not a good use of taxpayer dollars. Mrs. Kirkpatrick. So are those funds obligated then? Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. They are technically obligated, but they show up in different columns. And we are working also to make sure that we are more transparent in those kinds of long lead-time activities. And so, yes. The answer is yes. Mrs. Kirkpatrick. We would appreciate that as the committee, because, I mean we are charged with oversight of the program. Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. Absolutely. Mrs. Kirkpatrick. And I feel like we are just not getting all the information. Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. OK. Mrs. Kirkpatrick. My next question is for Dr. Park. And I am going to change the subject slightly to the nuclear security challenges. What nuclear security challenges are you most concerned about? And what are you doing to address these threats? Mr. Park. So as it turns out, it is not a single event, it is not a single topic that we are worried about. It is a string of events. So I will provide you with a few quick snapshots of what we are worried about. Now we are worried about countries like Iran, DPRK, and so on and so forth, and how they actually work with like-minded countries and work with the IAEA and so on and so forth to make sure no materials will leave these countries and they don't go--they don't advance their nuclear programs. At the same time, if you go far to the right into the future, we are worried about there are more countries now than ever before who want to own nuclear power plants, for example. We want to actually be in the game, ahead of the curve, to make sure they actually apply all these nuclear technologies for a peaceful purpose. It is actually a wide spectrum of challenges we are facing, and that is exactly the program that we have in the DNN. So we actually look at a wide variety all at the same time, as a function of time, as a function of location, as a function of how we can team up with other countries and so on. This is an international effort to a large extent. As much as we have leadership on many of the things, we work with the IAEA, we work with the U.K., we actually have a great relationship with Japan to make sure that they are actually giving up the materials that they don't need anymore. In fact, I am happy to report to this committee that we are in the process of retrieving 90 kilograms of SNM from Japan this coming year, special nuclear material. So it is not a single event. One thing that I need to emphasize is that we cannot take our eyes off on the things we have been doing. We have been converting high performance research reactors that use HEU. We are converting it to use LEU. Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. Low-enriched Uranium. Mr. Park. Low-enriched Uranium. Thank you. We cannot slow those efforts down, by the way, and chase after new concerns. We need to maintain a steady state effort, if you would, in all of the things we have been doing, and then continue to make process and be ahead of the curve. And the phrase that the chairwoman used, anticipating threats, and that is actually what we do. So, again, it is a connection of all of these events that would drive our program requirements. Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Madam Chair, I have one other quick question. May I extend my time? And so it sounds to me like you need highly trained engineers and scientists to do this work. Are you working with universities to make that you have got people coming through the pipeline to fill these positions? Mr. Park. Excellent. We actually have center of excellence programs, and we actually have three centers supporting over 40 universities, by the way. With your support on the university outreach program, we are doing that. Our labs, by the way, they do their own outreach program that is not part of headquarters' efforts. But all the labs that we work with--Los Alamos, PNNL, Oak Ridge National Lab-- all these labs have a very robust education program. In fact, when I started my career at Los Alamos in the 1980s, I was a Ph.D. student. So there are many of us in the pipeline. So looking at your program to us, yes, we have a robust program, but it is much bigger than you think it is because of our labs. They actually have a robust engagement, literally training thousands of people. If I am allowed to add one more? Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Sure. Mr. Park. I work closely with Dr. Verdon. Many of the programs I support for Ms. Gordon-Hagerty, I require Charlie Verdon's people, because these are nuclear materials experts. So, again, when you see the modernization and the buildup on the Defense Program side, Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, we benefit substantially, because that is the money that I don't have to invest. But, again, this is a close cooperation between the NA-10 and NA-20 within NNSA, so we strongly support this cooperation with the university. Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Thank you. I am glad to hear that. I yield back. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you. Congresswoman Fleischmann. Mr. Fleischmann. Thank you, Madam Chair. I had a brief absence. My apologies. I had to run to the floor. We are working on a bipartisan supplemental for the coronavirus. So my apologies. But that is going very well. Madam Administrator, thank you for being here today to this distinguished panel. I have worked with each and every one of you all for several years, and I know you. I want to thank you on behalf of the Congress, our committee. You have done an exemplary job. Our Nation's nuclear deterrent is critically important to the security of our country. Just last week, I was at STRATCOM, and I shared my plaudits for this group, and I have received it back as well. So thank you so much for your endeavors. A very quick question, Madam Administrator. I understand in my absence you addressed the issue of UPF replacing Y-12. Thank you for your request for robust funding. We have worked together with this subcommittee to get the resources necessary, I think, to keep that moving. But very briefly, are you pleased with the progress? And how do we plan to keep this on time and on budget? Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. We are extremely pleased with the process. And as I mentioned in your absence, this is a program, a $6.5 billion major construction project at Y-12, that will be completed by the end of 2025 for not more than $6.5 billion. To date, we have expended $3.1 billion in contracts and work, and we are on time and on schedule for the seventh year in a row. Mr. Fleischmann. And I thank you. In my tenure, we have seen a redesign, we have seen it brought under budget, and just truly a tremendous project. And a credit to the men and women and your contractors as well. Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. And a special credit to our acquisition and project management team at headquarters that has really put some fidelity into our programs. Mr. Fleischmann. Agreed. Last week, one of my colleagues from the other side of the dais raised an issue, Madam Administrator, that was a very valid question, but did concern me in terms of the housing of NNSA, where NNSA would be. Obviously, I am very pleased with where it is right now and what you all are doing. But there were some questions that were raised with the Secretary. He made it very clear, I believe, in his response that NNSA--and I am using my words--has a safe home here in the Department of Energy. I would like your thoughts on that, and just maybe reassurance for the committee as to where you think NNSA will be housed. Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. I support the administration's position that NNSA continue to be housed in DOE as an agency. Mr. Fleischmann. Thank you. Thank you very much. As do I. Dr. Verdon, the President's budget requests an additional $109 million for a lithium production facility. How important is this facility to our ability to execute the nuclear mission? Mr. Verdon. Thank you. It is very important. When we, as the Administrator set out, when we looked at what the requirements were from the DOD and the facilities we needed to meet those requirements, we are not trying to modernize all the facilities that are 70 years, back from the 1970s. We have identified the key facilities to meet the DOD requirements as well as workforce safety. And Lithium is one of those facilities where it is an essential material, making essential components for the nuclear weapons, and that is why it is one of our highest-priority facilities to bring up to support the DOD's deliverables. Mr. Fleischmann. Thank you, sir. My final question. Given the challenges associated with the hiring for the unique roles within our defense nuclear establishment, as well as the length of the clearance and training process, what steps do you plan to take to be able to execute this budget increase? Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. Representative Fleischmann, we have undertaken a corporate approach to a hiring strategy across all of the NNSA labs, plants, and sites, field offices, and headquarters, and I am happy to report we hired 7,700 people across our entire enterprise this last year. It is a robust program. We visited colleges and universities, including the University of Toledo. I had the pleasure of visiting with Chairwoman Kaptur this last year. We are doing a great job. The strength of our program and our national security mission is truly a lure for scientists and engineers, for the technicians we need. We are also undertaking robust programs at different technical colleges for skilled craft that we need across our entire enterprise as well. So we are working along those lines, and we are seeing really, really, really good results as we continue our efforts. It also requires, however, security clearances, as you said. And while we have seen traditionally security clearances have taken an average of 444 days, we are now seeing approximately 130 days in our security clearance process. We are working closely with OPM, with the office, NBIB, that handles the security clearances, and also with the Department of Defense, who is now taking over those programs. We have incredible opportunities. We cannot ask people to come and work with us and serve our Nation and have them sit on their hands while they are waiting for their security clearances. And, in fact, we are finding other useful work for them to do while we are waiting for their clearances. Mr. Fleischmann. Thank you for your thoughtful responses. And, again, thank you for what you do for our great Nation. I yield back. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much, Mr. Fleischmann. I wanted to ask you, Administrator Gordon-Hagerty, you often talk about all the jobs that are available at NNSA and different categories of jobs. You are very open to seeking individuals from places in the country that haven't been asked before. But is there an easy way to access the full job list on your website? Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. Yes. We are working with our labs, plants, and sites. Because of our labs, plants, and sites being unique in their characteristics--they are actually contractors--there are some bureaucratic issues that we are working through about whether or not contractors can look at other contractor websites, and they can look into the Federal websites. So we are working through that, that is actually one of the tasks that we have for our management and budget organization, so that we can have a better idea about all the jobs that are available throughout our entire enterprise. And to the extent that we have people that we are hiring, remember, we are coming across--we are coming into that bathtub curve where in the next 5 years nearly 40 percent of our workforce, 35 percent of our workforce, will be eligible for retirement. Right now, it is 21 percent at our headquarters and our field offices. We have got to do something about getting the workforce of the future in place now so we have mentorship, so we have some cross training. We can't just bring them in and expect them to do some jobs, do work, do useful work, and not have any training before them. So we are working along that-- Ms. Kaptur. Let me interrupt in view of the time, but just to say it is very difficult to try to figure out what those jobs are. And I doubt there is any Member of Congress that is sitting up here on the dais that could actually go in front of an audience and read some of the job categories and positions that you are asking for. So somehow NNSA has to figure out a way to communicate with the general public. Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. Sure. Ms. Kaptur. And I think all of us would welcome that. So I just wanted to mention it. I heard what you said about contractor difficulties. But just recognize even when I went to the website, I thought, ``Oh, my goodness.'' Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. I take that, and we will work on that. Ms. Kaptur. Generically, you might be able to prepare a different kind of list that doesn't label a particular lab but a particular skill. That could be very, very helpful to people, just by way of comment. Now, I wanted to move on. Admiral Richard from STRATCOM recently noted the nuclear enterprise can only absorb so much work at one time. As I understand it, NNSA is looking at moving the timeline for the Long-Range Standoff warhead to the right because NNSA's workload is too great. Is this true? And what are your plans to reduce scope for the W871? Yes? Mr. Verdon. So as part of any of our weapons acquisition programs, we are always looking. Especially in this case, where it is mostly the Air Force is developing a new missile at the same time we are developing the warhead for it, we are constantly working on it to make sure we are staying synchronized. So we are in that process. We do it almost annually, if not more frequently. We are in that process right now to make sure how their procurement is going, how our work is going, and then, if there is a need to change anything based on synchronization. So certainly we do discuss the idea of moving an internal milestone, but we do not do anything to change the IOC or the FOC, those stay fixed. We look at movements within that to better align the programs. So we are indeed doing that now, but no decisions have been made. They are being teed up now for the Nuclear Weapons Council's consideration based on the results we obtained. But it is just something we normally do to make sure we stay synchronized for both of those programs. And I will say now, our look already is we can move an internal milestone with no additional cost increase. We have already identified that, so that won't be--it won't be a major issue, but it will be more a synchronization issue for the all up round. And then, in terms of the 87, what we have done very recently is we have what we call threshold requirements, which is must-dos, and we have objective requirements, which are if possible, if they don't have major impact, if the cost is worth the benefit. And so we had--we have had a recent review on the 87 where we had two objective requirements that we were still working on, that we accelerated the review of those requirements for their consideration, and we had a lengthy analysis of the benefits, the costs associated with those requirements. And we brought those before the Nuclear Weapons Council and a decision was actually made not to go forward with those two objective requirements. So we have downscoped, if you like, the requirements that we were carrying on those warheads. All of the threshold requirements are still there, but those two objective requirements have been eliminated. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much.It know it is a heavily industrial region. And you, in your testimony again today, have mentioned some of the componentry that you could not or they are having difficulty acquiring. You mentioned capacitors as one. I am wondering if you could, just generically, discuss some of the componentry you are having trouble finding contractors for. And my question would be, how can NNSA expand its manufacturing base? And will those efforts help reduce your costs? And to supplement some of the academic alliances you currently have, what value would there be in an academic and industry consortium focused on helping NNSA with its manufacturing needs? Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. Go ahead. Mr. Verdon. So, yes, we are indeed, for many reasons, we are expanding our industrial base. As you mentioned the capacitor issue, that was a case where we had essentially a single vendor at the time, and we recognized that to add resiliency into our complex we actually had to expand the number of vendors that could provide us things like electronic components that you mentioned. So we are actively pursuing that and have actually increased the number of vendors that we are now utilizing on our, in particular, our life extension programs. The same is true for our large construction projects, where we are buying a considerable amount of equipment across the United States. We have expanded the vendor bases that we are using there. And we are even reaching out now to some of our great American industries to help us with advancing some of our manufacturing techniques, that instead of just replicating what we did during the Cold War, we are actually using American industry to learn from new manufacturing techniques and beginning to help us prototype those activities to actually bring them into the complex to hopefully make us more efficient than what we had in the past. So we are undertaking all those efforts that you mentioned, to try to improve, to certainly make the complex more resilient with the goal of also reducing the cost, making us more efficient. And in terms of the academic alliance, it is a great question. We have been actually asking that. And we are starting to look at, because we recognize that manufacturing is such an important component, of how do we expand and what universities can we tap into that could help us in the area of manufacturing and new manufacturing techniques, as I mentioned, to take advantage of what is being developed and to plan thoughtfully how to bring it into the complex as we go forward. Additive manufacturing is kind of a worked example now, but what is the next great thing out there? And we are starting to look at that now. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much. Mr. Simpson. Mr. Simpson. Thank you. A couple of things. Is it accurate to say that the Secretary of Energy supports the President's budget request, and that includes the NNSA budget? Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. Yes. Mr. Simpson. Contrary to some of the comments that were made. Could you effectively and efficiently spend the budget request if that request were to come about in the appropriation? Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. Yes. I am confident we can execute all of the missions that are given to us. Mr. Simpson. Let me ask Dr. Verdon. We have heard concerns that various components of the modernization program, including components that are in the early stages, are over budget and behind schedule. With major construction projects, we have a management process with milestones, including cost and schedule baselines against which we can measure performance. A couple questions. Is there a comparable management process for programs like the life extension program? And at what point are plans mature enough to produce legitimate cost estimates and schedules against which we can measure whether the life extension programs are over budget or behind schedule? Mr. Verdon. Yes, sir, there are. We use a process that sometimes you call it the Phase X process, or the Phase 6.X Process. It is a joint DOD, DOE, and NNSA acquisition process, warhead acquisition process, and it is a very rigorous process. And we do have a number of gates, a number of phases that we go through, a number of gates, a number of reports that have to be produced. There is a whole documentation, a very rigorous documentation has to be produced along the way. And there are certainly--like, one example is we adhere to--I think it is U.S. Code 55--2537, I think, which is the selected acquisition reports, a report to Congress that we provide annually on the schedule, the costs, and so forth. So we do provide annual snapshots and even more frequent snapshots of the progress we are making, how we are doing with the budget, how we are doing with the schedule. And basically that is how we monitor the progress on the programs, is through those types of activities and other additional reports. Recognizing it is a lot of information, and we would certainly offer that if there is information out of those reports that would make it easier for you to be able to transparently see what we are doing, we would be more than happy to work with you and your staff to pull out that information so that you are not having to read these very long reports that we produce. But it is a very rigorous, very, very rigorous process that we go through. Mr. Simpson. Appreciate that. Madam Administrator, it has been said that the production of 80 pits per year in 2030 is NNSA's highest infrastructure priority. NNSA is planning to split production between Los Alamos and Savannah River. What is the current cost estimates for each of these projects, and what is the level of fidelity we have for each of these cost estimates? And is Los Alamos on track to produce its first pit for use in a nuclear weapon by 2023 and up to 10 pits by 2024? And what challenges have NNSA and the contractor encountered? Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. Mr. Simpson, we have made great progress at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and in fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019 we produced 10 developmental pits. That gives us the opportunity to look at the characteristics of the plutonium pit as we are manufacturing them so we can get a higher fidelity in how we will ultimately produce the 10 pits per year in 2024, the 20 pits in 2025, and 30 pits per year starting in 2026, in perpetuity. We will continue that process. We are doing great work at Los Alamos in terms of bringing in the necessary equipment to execute that, to put the production mission in place, while we are also undertaking all of the actinide chemistry and the necessary and continued programs that are under the Plutonium Center of Excellence that is housed at Los Alamos. In addition to that, we are working through the conceptual design plan for the Savannah River plutonium processing site, which will use the facility formerly known as the mixed oxide facility, or the MOX facility, at Savannah River that then Secretary Perry terminated in 2018. We have been working with our contractor at the site, the Savannah River Nuclear Solutions Laboratory, our contractor to develop the conceptual design. We will move forward with that. We will receive that later this year. And we will move to conceptual design 1, which is CD-1, in fiscal year 2021. We have a very aggressive program, as I have mentioned before. It is our highest priority. And we believe that we can accomplish this mission. We are doing things in parallel with our Los Alamos and using Livermore experts, since they used to have a plutonium production or plutonium capability at Livermore, which we did inventory in about the 2011 timeframe. So our single plutonium manufacturing capability in the United States at the present time is Los Alamos. We are looking to develop a rigorous and resilient program for our infrastructure in the future. As a reminder, more than 30 years ago, we shuttered the plutonium pit capability in the United States at Rocky Flats, which we did in around 1989, 1990. It is time we develop a resilient enterprise for our current and future nuclear deterrent. Mr. Simpson. Thank you. Finally, Admiral Caldwell, you mentioned in your testimony about the unanticipated cost increases in the fuel handling facility. As we talked, it was a variety of things, but the cost of steel and concrete and so forth, and those costs--bids came in at a much higher cost than were anticipated. That is putting pressure on your budget in other areas. What other areas is it putting pressure on? Is it putting pressure on developing new nuclear technologies that you put on the shelf and that kind of stuff? Admiral Caldwell. In this particular case, sir, the budget or the bids that came in substantially over what was expected have put pressure on my facilities and infrastructure spending in fiscal year 2021, my request for fiscal year 2021. So to accommodate that I have had to defer to major MCPs and move out some other facilities work that I was planning on doing, but I am able to handle what I need to do in fiscal year 2021 within the current request. The challenge will be, as we go into future years, fiscal year 2022 and beyond, I am trying to step up the investment that we make in research and development. We have devoted over the last many years focus on the three major projects, which include the refueling of the reactor in New York, the spent fuel handling facility, and the Columbia project. And now, as those projects are in execution, we need to really refocus on developing the advanced technologies that the Navy needs to make the Navy--provide capability to the Navy in the future. Some of those things are advanced instrumentation and control, advanced core concepts to be able to load more fuel in, advanced manufacturing capabilities to reduce cost and schedule duration and improve performance. So there will be pressure on my budget in R&D, research and development, as I go forward, and there will also be pressure on my ability to recapitalize older facilities and to continue an aggressive pace of decontamination and decommissioning activities. So that all said, I have got to figure out how I am going to manage through that. Right now, I am prioritizing the research and development, taking some pain in the facilities and infrastructure. But as we come forward, I will work with NNSA and DOE and your staff here on the Hill to figure out the best way to do that and continue to meet what the Navy needs. Mr. Simpson. Thank you. Thank you all for being here today. I appreciate it very much. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you. Congressman Fleischmann. Mr. Fleischmann. Madam Chair, I have no further questions. I yield back. Thank you. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much. Administrator Gordon-Hagerty, what does the future of the nonproliferation program look like? And I think Dr. Park might want to also address this. How is our country positioning itself to address emergent challenges as other countries seek to harness nuclear energy technologies? Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. Madam Chairwoman, as we discussed yesterday, I am delighted to have Dr. Park's leadership in our Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation program. We are embarking on a strategic, on both a parallel path, which is doing the good work of the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation program, also looking from a strategic perspective about those emerging countries that are looking to acquire peaceful uses and continue down that path. I would like to defer to Dr. Park on that. But I think we are making some great inroads, and we have some great strategic planning going on in our efforts. So I think that will pay dividends for our Nation and for like nations in the future. Mr. Park. Thank you, ma'am. Again, thank you for your outstanding leadership supporting the DNN program. Actually, all of NNSA. So as I stated earlier, we actually look at full coverage worldwide. That requires a steady state improvement in how we do what we do. For example, in terms of removing, eliminating nuclear materials, or better protecting them, or working with international partners so they can actually better protect the materials they own. And, whenever they don't need it, we like to work with them, work with the IAEA, to make sure we actually have a solution to get rid of them. Eliminate forever is our theme. And at the same time, as the new countries show up interested in nuclear technologies, we prefer they work with the United States through a 123 agreement, but even if they don't we want to work the IAEA and like-minded countries to actually share with them what it takes to be nuclear industry-- nuclear technology owner. It takes a lot, by the way. So we actually spend a fair amount of energy educating our newcomers to the nuclear technology--the membership. Recently, a year ago, in fact, Administrator Gordon-Hagerty and I participated in an insider threat symposium, where we actually had 60 countries participate. Protection is not just from outside; it is also from within. And many of the countries joining this nuclear technology membership, if you would, they actually did not know what we meant by ``insider threat.'' So it is actually by educating them. There is a softer side of engagement in nuclear nonproliferation, and we do that quite a bit. At the same time, we work with other countries that actually own substantial amount of nuclear materials, and we would like to actually find a way to make sure we have a consistent solution to the international community, and, at the same time--but there are many things that we worry about. One of the things that we actually spent a lot of time on is developing technologies to make sure we actually have verifiable treaties. So I am happy to report to you NNSA does a substantial technology leadership role, play a substantial leadership role in coming up with the technologies to actually monitor these activities from the ground, from air, space, and so on, and I think we have provided the multiple classified briefings to you on what we do with the satellites and so forth, working with the U.S. Air Force, for example. I could go on. But, essentially, it is actually important for me to recognize we have a very important counterterrorism program within the DNN, and we actually work with international partners in that area as well so they can actually respond should there be an incident. We cannot go after every incident that there is in the world. So, again, we go out there. We have a very able staff within NNSA. And they go out there and train them, educate them, and we do tabletop exercises, and so on. I mean, I would like to respect your time. But, again, it is actually in-depth. But there are new technologies, dual-use technologies that we worry about that I am more than happy to cover in a classified setting that we are really spending our time on going forward. Ms. Kaptur. All right. I thank you very much for that, and we might ask for that classified setting briefing. Congressman Simpson. Mr. Simpson. I am---- Ms. Kaptur. You are finished. OK. Thank you. Final question. Madam Administrator, the Department has a clearly defined process for managing construction projects. That really isn't so for ongoing life extension programs and requesting funding for a fifth, brand new warhead program. What specific changes are you making to your current weapons acquisition process to increase transparency for Congress and to avoid future cost increases and schedule delays? Ms. Gordon-Hagerty. Madam Chairwoman, we have made some significant progress under Dr. Verdon's leadership in this area, and I defer to him to explain exactly how we are upgrading and updating our processes for weapons activities. Mr. Verdon. Yes, ma'am. So part of our continuous effort to improve and lessons from the B61 and the 88, we are making changes, improvements to our acquisition process. A couple of highlights that we would say is we recognize that we need earlier engagement between the design agencies and the production agencies, so those are being implemented. More senior leadership engagement from the M&O sites, not only within their own site, but across the site. Improving a shared FADE approach and more discussion and collaboration amongst the sites. More Federal oversight of the technical choices and decisions that are being made. So there are a number of improvements we are making. Those are just a few. We are putting quite a few others in place as well. As I did mention, we do have a pretty--it is a pretty rigorous acquisition process, and I recognize it contains a lot of information. We try to invite your committee staff members to a quarterly review of all of our life extension programs so they can hear the updates right from the people that are conducting the programs, to get a status of how they are moving, how they are progressing, where our issues are, as well as the documented reports. As I mentioned, the selected acquisition reports, where we document on an annual basis how we are doing against costs, how we are doing against schedule. But as of our life extension programs right now, we made the commitment that the issue we encountered on the B61 and the 88, that we would fix it from within the portfolio of our life extension programs, and we did that. While, if you look at the budget, the 61 and the 88 do go up because of the technical issue we encountered, the 80 and the 87 went down in comparison because we made efficiency improvements on the 80, and we made those down-selects that I referenced on the 87. So within the life extension program, we actually balanced the increased costs in the 61 and the 88 through cost savings on the 80 and the 87. Ms. Kaptur. All right. I want to thank you for placing that on the record. Thank you for placing that on the record. And any additional information you can give us on how we can have greater transparency for congressional oversight would be greatly appreciated. If you could provide some additional documentation to the record in that regard. Mr. Verdon. Certainly. Ms. Kaptur. I would certainly be very appreciative of that on behalf of the entire committee. We have been fortunately joined by one of our most capable members, whom we are so pleased to have joined us here this afternoon, Congressman Derek Kilmer from the State of Washington, who has been a very faithful attendee at everything. I know he had competing committees. So we thank him very much for joining us today. If you have any questions you would like to put forth, we recognize you. Mr. Kilmer. Thank you, Madam Chair. My apologies. We had a briefing on the coronavirus with the Vice President, and coming from Washington State, as you can imagine, that is a high priority for us. And I did set the land speed record from that briefing to this committee room. Thank you for being with us. Admiral Caldwell, thank you for your terrific leadership and partnership. And it wouldn't be an opportunity for me to visit with you without checking in on the Enterprise disposal issue. The Navy is issuing a contract solicitation for dismantling and disposing of a surface ship support barge contaminated by nuclear materials. And I understand the Navy is establishing a process with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for technical and contractual implementation of NRC regulations governing the disposal of the barge. I also understand that the precedents established with the NRC while dismantling the barge will inform the process of dismantling the aircraft carrier Enterprise. With that in mind, I was hoping you could speak to how this contract solicitation and barge work fit into the plan for the disposal of the Enterprise. Is this the template you plan to use for the Enterprise? If you are not sure, what could you discover in the process that leads you to a different model for the Enterprise? And is there anything you have already learned from the barge disposal contract solicitation that you can share? Admiral Caldwell. Thanks for the question, sir, and I understand your interest in this. As you know, it is my responsibility to handle the materials in my program from cradle to grave, and we have a long history of regulating and responsibly dealing with the materials and disposing of them properly, protecting our people and the environment and the program's reputation. The surface ship support barge was a refurbished tanker that was used for defueling Nimitz-class aircraft carriers. It was last used for defueling the USS Abraham Lincoln. And now that that system is obsolete because we have implemented new technologies, it is my responsibility to properly dispose of it. So we are moving down a path and we have submitted requests for proposals, and we have answers back. We are now in the source selection phase, so I won't go into any details on that. But we are working with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and we have had a lot of dialogue with them and have an interagency agreement that we have negotiated with them. What we are learning in this process is that there are a lot of interested parties in this business. As the commercial ship-breaking business has come about, there is a substantial amount of interest. My responsibility is to do this safely, securely, and do it at an affordable way for the Nation. So we are, as we go forward, we are continuing to understand and learn about our regulatory framework. We are continuing to learn on other aspects of the job as we move forward. And while it may inform some steps for Enterprise, it in no way is determining the answer for Enterprise, and in fact no specific decisions have been made with regards to the Enterprise disposal path. That said, we are evaluating options, and we are working on an environmental impact statement. The draft environmental impact statement will be released next year. And it is my promise to you that we will continue to keep your staff informed as we improve forward on this effort. Mr. Kilmer. Thank you. Admiral Caldwell. Yes, sir. Mr. Kilmer. And I appreciate the persistent transparency and engagement with both my team and with me. So thank you for that. Admiral Caldwell. Roger, sir. Mr. Kilmer. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much. And I would just like to thank our ranking member, Congressman Fleischmann, Congressman Kilmer, for being here, and for having full committee participation today. It was just a great hearing. We thank you very much for being with us today. That concludes this afternoon's hearing. And I would like to thank each and every one of our witnesses. I ask the witnesses to please ensure for the hearing record that questions for the record and any supporting information requested by the subcommittee are delivered in final form no later than 3 weeks from the time you receive them. Members who have additional questions for the record will have until the close of business on Monday to provide them to the subcommittee office. Our hearing is adjourned. [Material submitted for the record follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE FORMAT] [GRAPHIC(S) FORMAT] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Tuesday, March 10, 2020 ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS WITNESSES HON. R.D. JAMES, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE ARMY, CIVIL WORKS LIEUTENANT GENERAL TODD SEMONITE, COMMANDING GENERAL AND CHIEF OF ENGINEERS, U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, TIMOTHY R. PETTY, ASSISTANT SECRETARY, WATER AND SCIENCE, DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR BRENDA BURMAN, COMMISSIONER, U.S. BUREAU OF RECLAMATION Ms. Kaptur. The subcommittee will please come to order. We are here today to discuss the fiscal year 2021 budget request for the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. Thank you to our witnesses for being here today. I want to extend a special thank you to General Semonite, whose term as Chief of Engineers and Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will end in May. That is both good news and bad news. On behalf of our subcommittee, I would like to thank you, General, for your service, your fine service to our country and for all you have done for the Corps in your important role. You have demonstrated an unwavering dedication to addressing our Nation's water resources, its needs during a challenging period of environmental reset due to climate change. Thank you for all the disasters you have helped us avoid and for those that you have helped to clean up. Last year, we faced similar circumstances. Your agencies were under pressure from significant flooding in the Midwest and drought in the West. Again, today, Mississippians across that State are still drying out from the Pearl River flood, 45- percent of western States are experiencing some form of drought, the Great Lakes are at an all-time high, and precipitation and snowpack have been below average in California so far in 2020. Climate change is accelerating and communities are caught in the cross-hairs. Though the water resource needs of our country vary from region to region, there is a constant and essential need to invest in our infrastructure. Without significant investment in our infrastructure, the dichotomy of water surpluses in the middle belt and water shortages in the West threatens Americans from all walks of life. Although Congress last year rejected the administration's proposed deep cuts, the Trump administration has once again proposed to slash funding for the Corps and Bureau of Reclamation, this time by 22 percent and 32 percent, respectively. When will the White House learn their proposal is flawed and dangerous to our people and our communities? These proposed cuts are greatly disappointing to this subcommittee and to our colleagues from both parties. These cuts are divorced from reality. We all know our water resource infrastructure impacts the life and safety of our citizens, as well as America's economic prosperity. I am particularly incensed about this administration's lack of attention to the needs of the people of the Great Lakes region. Yes, the administration has prioritized the Soo Locks, and a broad bipartisan coalition in this House is thankful. However, the economic and environmental threat that the Asian Bighead Carp pose to the Great Lakes, a multibillion dollar fishery and the economic lifeblood of millions of Americans, is just as great as the threat of failure of the Soo Locks. The continually rising lake level across the Great Lakes threatens millions more people, ports, and communities, and adds to the threat of the Asian Bighead Carp sweeping into the Great Lakes. Yet this administration has ignored clear congressional intent by refusing to fund the next phase of work for the Brandon Road LOCK and Dam and by refusing to begin a Great Lakes Coastal Resiliency Study. Worst of all, President Trump reneged on his word. He made a promise to the Great Lakes at a recent Michigan rally that he would move swiftly and stop Asian Bighead Carp. But as we have learned, he can be full of empty promises, and when the cameras were turned off, he overruled the Army Corps and stopped the Brandon Road project dead in its tracks. But this committee, this subcommittee, will persevere. Despite these proposed cuts, rest assured that there is bipartisan support in Congress for the work that your agencies undertake on behalf of the American people. Do not be deterred by these draconian cuts. The subcommittee recognizes and appreciates the importance of your work. I wanted to say before we recognize Mr. Simpson regarding the schedule of our hearing, we anticipate having votes at about 3:45. I would encourage everyone, including our witnesses, to be as brief as possible. I will now turn to our ranking member, Mr. Simpson, for his opening remarks. [The prepared statement of Ms. Kaptur follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT TIFF FORMAT] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Simpson. Thank you, Chairwoman Kaptur. I would like to join you in welcoming our witnesses. We appreciate you being here today to discuss the fiscal year 2021 budget request for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Civil Works Program, the Department of Interior's Central Utah Project, and the Bureau of Reclamation. General Semonite, I understand that this is likely your last hearing before this committee. Whether you like it or not, I am not sure. You brought great energy to your term as Chief of Engineers. Thank you for your service to the Corps and to the Nation. The budget requests for these water resource programs, once again, include sizeable reductions from enacted levels, 32 percent for the Bureau of Reclamation and the Central Utah Project, 22 percent for the Corps of Engineers. Reductions are no surprise. It happens almost every year, regardless of who is in the White House and who is in charge of Congress. The only surprising thing to me is that the reductions for the Corps was not even larger. When you move the funding request for FUSRAP back to the Corps, which Congress is likely to do, the budget request total is $6.1 billion. That is not just the highest budget request in many years, it is more than $1 billion higher than all but one budget request in the last 20 years. Unfortunately, I continue to have concerns about the projects specific allocation process, especially when it comes to the annual work plan. Over the past several years, we have seen continued disregard for congressional direction, which is incorporated into law. We have seen encouragement of allowing non-Federal sponsors to buy their way to the front of the line for Federal funding, and we have seen funding categories ignored. I think I know how these problems are finding their way into the work plan process, but to make sure, I will have some questions on these issues at the appropriate time. The infrastructure investments carried out by the Corps and the Bureau of Reclamation are critical to improving our national economy, public health and safety, and the environment. I think Congresswoman Kaptur said last year that this is the biggest infrastructure bill we have. We all talk about infrastructure, but this is the biggest infrastructure bill that we have. I am confident that, once again, this committee will work together to provide strong support for these programs. Thank you, Chairwoman Kaptur, for calling this hearing. I look forward to discussion with our witnesses. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much, Ranking Member Simpson. We will now turn to the ranking member of the full committee, Kay Granger of Texas. Welcome. Ms. Granger. Thank you very much. I would like to thank you, Chairman Kaptur and Ranking Member Simpson, for holding the hearing today on fiscal year 2021 budget for the Civil Works Program with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Interior's Bureau of Reclamation and Central Utah Project. I want to say particularly to Lieutenant General Semonite, I enjoyed our trip. It was very helpful. We went on the border and saw what was happening there, and it was a short trip but very, very helpful. Thank you. And the Honorable R.D. James, we have worked together such a long time on projects that are close to what I am doing in Congress, and in my district, and thank you for all the work that you have done. I would also like to thank our witnesses for being here today. Your agencies are the Nation's foremost experts on water resources development and management issues, and we all appreciate the important work that you do. Your efforts support our economy; protect public health and safety; improve the environment; and generate clean, renewable hydroelectric power for communities across the country. The Corps of Engineers also carries out significant construction work for other Federal agencies. I have had the opportunity to see firsthand the work the Corps is doing on behalf of U.S. Customs and Border Patrol as we went on our trip, and that was very helpful. I have witnessed many construction projects over the year, and I know how difficult the work is. I commend your team for doing really a quality job on such a complex project. Unfortunately, the executive branch has consistently proposed reductions for the important programs we are discussing today. Although the budget request for the Corps of Engineers is the highest request in many years, that request and the request for the Bureau of Reclamation are significant reductions from current levels. I wish everyone who did that could see what I see and those of us who are on this subcommittee and how important your work is. So thank you very much for your testimony, and I am glad to be with you. Thank you. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much, Ranking Member Granger. Now let us proceed. First, we will hear from the Honorable R.D. James, Assistant Secretary--I should say outstanding Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works. Mr. James serves as the 12th Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works and previously served on the Mississippi River Commission, and he is no stranger to the Corps. Next, we will have Lieutenant General Todd T. Semonite, the 54th Chief of Engineers, also outstanding. Lieutenant General Semonite assumed his current position on May 19, 2016. As I stated in my opening remarks, General Semonite's term in this role will end this May. Again, thank you for your leadership, General Semonite, always with a smile. Following that, Assistant Secretary Timothy Petty, the assistant secretary for Water and Science at the Department of Interior. Previously, Assistant Secretary Petty served as acting assistant secretary and deputy assistant secretary for Water and Science at the Department of Interior under President George W. Bush. Last but not least, we have the Commissioner, Brenda Burman, from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. Commissioner Burman is the 23d commissioner for the Bureau of Reclamation and the first woman to lead Reclamation. Thank you all for taking the time to be here today. Without objection, your written statements will be entered into the record. Please feel free to summarize your remarks in about 3 minutes, starting with Assistant Secretary James. STATEMENT OF HON. R.D. JAMES Mr. James. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman and members of the committee. Thank you for inviting me here today to testify, and thank you for your time to listen to me. I do have a written testimony here. It is the same as I would turn in for the record. So under your timeline, I think I will just forego reading it, unless you want me to. Mr. Calvert. You can skip anything you want. Ms. Kaptur. Please proceed. Mr. James. There are a few things I would bring up. The Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, has become very, very interested in the inland waterway system of this country and the needs of the inland waterway system of this country as it relates to agriculture, of course, from his wheelhouse. He and I, I am working on a plan with him to make the needs of inland waterway known around this country. We rolled out in St. Louis, Missouri, last fall, and we intend to be speaking at other areas around the country as we go forward. Of course, agriculture isn't the only thing that uses the inland waterway system, but that is Secretary Perdue's focus is on the needs of agriculture and how the inland waterway system helps agriculture. The other thing that I would mention is that the CEQ, Council on Environmental Quality, is, as we speak, looking over the NEPA process, which is somewhere around 40 years old now, and the feeling--and I share that feeling actually--is that it needs to be refreshed and looked at and see if we can update that in any way to make it better for the people that we all serve, and also, I think, discover places where we might be able to save money and get more dirt moved for the dollar. That is what I am hoping for. The other thing that I would mention to you that you may or may not know about is the water subcabinet. The water subcabinet is made up of all the major agencies, including Commerce, Interior, EPA, Agriculture--who have I forgot? Mr. Petty. DOE. Mr. James. The Department of Energy, Army Corps Civil Works. Now, why do we need another bureaucratic agency in this town? Well, that is what I thought when this started, it really was. I have been to several of their meetings. I feel completely different. It is going to let us as a U.S. Government look at the same problems from different perspectives and come out with one idea. That is the hope. That is what we are trying to do. We have had a couple of examples of that already, and it seems to be working fine, and I am proud to be a member of that subcabinet. The other thing that bothers me personally is the fact of the benefit-cost ratios that we are discovering through our core processes of studies and feasibility studies and the PED part of the study, and I can't believe that some of our projects' benefit-cost ratios are as low as they are. I don't feel like we are discovering all the benefits of a project in our processes the way that we are doing them right now. I will be looking into that with General Semonite and/or his replacement as the summer goes long. And we are not trying to bamboozle anybody, but if there is a flood control project, we want to make sure it gets the benefits, its regional benefits, plus its national economic benefits. And I don't think we are doing that. I don't think we are deep diving into what are the benefits. Same way with our locks and dams. I don't think we are deep diving into that. We are just doing the NED benefits. That is like skimming the surface. So I will be working on that as this summer goes along as well. With that, I will stop. I used my whole 5 minutes anyway. [The prepared statement of Mr. James follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE TIFF FORMAT] [GRAPHIC(S) IN TIFF FORMAT] Ms. Kaptur. Thank you, Assistant Secretary James, for your fine service. General Semonite, please begin. STATEMENT OF LT. GENERAL TODD SEMONITE General Semonite. Chairwoman Kaptur, Ranking Member Simpson, and distinguished members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I am pleased to be here with Assistant Secretary James and appreciate his leadership of the Army Civil Works team as we continue to work together to address water resources and infrastructure challenges across the great Nation. I have been in command of the Corps for nearly 4 years, and I have challenged the enterprise to revolutionize the way we do business. This does not imply that the Corps is not a world-class organization; rather, it demands that we anticipate and respond to changing requirements and externalities like all world-class organizations. Successful civil works project delivery supports the Nation's current and future energy and water infrastructure priorities. The Corps' credibility is measured by our ability to deliver results that are on time, on budget, and of exceptional quality. To that end, the Corps has been taking bold actions to improve performance to continue to engineer solutions for the Nation's toughest challenges. We are able to do this because we have a world-class workforce of talented and dedicated professionals who are actually passionate about what we do. However, none of our work is done alone. It is done in full participation and collaboration with many others like yourselves. We appreciate the appropriations provided by this committee to focus on current mission areas and serve as a guide to implement the Civil Works Program with a strategic vision taking pioneering steps to remain relevant and ready for the challenges of tomorrow. The fiscal year 2021 civil works budget is performance based, focused on reducing flood risks in communities across the Nation, facilitating commercial navigation, restoring aquatic ecosystems, and generating a low-cost renewable hydropower. Our targeted approach allows us to invest $5.966 billion in discretionary funds towards commercial navigation, flood and storm damage reduction, and aquatic ecosystem restoration, all of which benefit the Nation's economy, the environment, and public safety, now and in the future. I would like to focus my remarks on a couple of significant programs and projects in this year's budget. The fiscal year 2021 budget provides $102.6 million in the Investigations account to evaluate and design projects within the Corps' three main mission areas and for related work, including research and development. $2.265 billion of the fiscal year 2021 budget will be used for the Construction program to produce as much value as possible for our Nation from the available funds. Funding is also prioritized for mitigation work at ongoing construction projects and work needed to comply with biological opinions and with treaties. The Corps continues to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the operation and maintenance program. The budget focuses on investments that address infrastructure maintenance needs on a risk-informed basis. The budget also provides a total of $3.123 billion for the operations and maintenance programming, including $158.8 million in the Mississippi River and Tributaries account, and $967.9 million in the Harbor Maintenance account. We appreciate, value, and depend upon the support of the administration, the Congress, and all of our partners to succeed in our mission. I am very proud of the work that the Corps accomplishes, and I am equally aware that the organizations can and will improve. I have been and remain committed to instituting lasting changes to the Corps' delivery process in order to become a more efficient and effective organization. We process more than 80,000 permits annually for the regulatory program to effectively protect and preserve water related resources of this Nation. We need to be optimally funded at $210 million. The Corps strives to be value added to deliver solutions as the Nation's engineers. We cannot conduct these reforms in isolation. We need the help of OMB and Congress to unleash the power of the Corps by acting on our numerous work plan and budget recommendations. For more than 244 years, the Corps has adapted to meet the challenges of the day. Today is no exception. Our current efforts to revolutionize the Corps simply represent the next chapter in this remarkable journey. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman and members of this committee. I appreciate all the comments you said at the beginning about my tenure, and after 41 years, it is the pride of my life to be able to be in this job, and I really appreciate the support of this committee and this Congress in helping us do our job. Thank you. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you, General. And for the millions of miles you have traveled in our country and abroad, thank you very, very much. Assistant Secretary Petty, please begin. STATEMENT OF HON. TIMOTHY PETTY Mr. Petty. Thank you, Chairwoman Kaptur, Ranking Member Simpson, the rest of the committee members. It is a pleasure to be here today and to discuss with you the President's fiscal budget for 2021 at Department of Interior and the Bureau of Reclamation and the Central Utah Project Completion Act, also referred to as CUPCA. I greatly appreciate your ongoing support of our programs. I am also pleased to join the commissioner here today, and I thank her for her leadership that has been just outstanding in the work of reclamation. Overall, the Department of Interior's complete 2021 budget request is $12.8 billion in current funding. So much of that work is just built into the use of sustainability and natural resources. Reliable water supply and energy security of our discussion here today is critical in supporting the economic prosperity of communities in the West, the Bureau of Reclamation's operations, including recreational support of over $63 billion in economic activity and over 450,000 jobs each year that reclamation supports. Reclamation's annual average of roughly 40 billion kilowatt hours of electricity provides for more than 1 billion in gross power revenues for the Federal Government. The 2021 budget request supports our efforts to address the challenges that impact the availability and reliability of water supply. This budget also furthers Interior's commitment to working with Indian Tribes toward Tribal prosperity. Across Interior, the budget includes $156 million for Indian settlements commitment, of that $112.1 million in Reclamation's efforts toward fulfilling those responsibilities. Our Nation's water resource challenges will only be addressed through cooperative efforts. Assistant Secretary James referenced earlier the importance of that collaboration, and I continue to engage on so many of his counterparts and other agencies with water-related responsibilities. Our cross efforts increase coordination, which focuses resources, which reduces duplication across the Federal Government. We recognize that work collaboratively. We can better support work that is underway to address the water challenges in areas of drought, water quality, water reuse, weather forecasting, just to name a few items. Finally, Interior's budget request includes the CUPCA program and CUPCA office. This falls under the jurisdiction of the assistant secretary. In 2021 budget, request the office is allocating $10 million for the continual planning/construction oversight activities of all of these efforts being completed in the State of Utah. In conclusion, I would like to submit all my work and records here. And, again, thank you so much for all the effort and support that you give to the Department of Interior. [The prepared statement of Mr. Petty follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE TIFF FORMAT] [GRAPHIC(S) IN TIFF FORMAT] Ms. Kaptur. Thank you, Mr. Assistant Secretary, very much. Now we will hear from Commissioner Burman. Please begin. Thank you. STATEMENT OF HON. BRENDA BURMAN Ms. Burman. Thank you, Chairwoman Kaptur, Ranking Member Simpson, members of the subcommittee, for the opportunity to discuss today the President's budget for the Bureau of Reclamation. I am Brenda Burman. This is my third year testifying in front of you as the Commissioner of Reclamation. Before I begin, I would like to thank the committee for your hard work and support in providing funding for our projects in fiscal year 2020. Having full funding has made a profound difference in Reclamation's ability to fulfill our mission with the resources Congress intended for that purpose. We are grateful as well for the appropriation of both WIN funding as well as additional funds for the priorities we share with you, particularly rural water, water conservation and delivery, and WaterSMART and title XVI. In this hearing, it is my goal to testify to the strengths and purpose of Reclamation's fiscal year 2021 budget request, a budget which continues to address water supply challenges in the West. Our goal remains to ensure water reliability and the efficient generation of energy, our mission, to celebrate America's recreational opportunities and to uphold the commitments to Tribal nations and the environment. The 2021 budget prioritizes these functions and fully supports Reclamation's vital role out West. I wanted to take an opportunity to talk a little bit about hydrology, and you have some slides in front of you and up on the wall, and this is where Reclamation works. This is the background in which we work, and in 2020, I just wanted to give you a little bit of an idea of what is going on in the West. If we could go to the hydrology slide. So when you look at the West this year--and, Chairwoman Kaptur, you mentioned some of this--we see that in many places we are running about average on hydrology. If you look up in the Missouri Basin, we have full reservoirs from a very wet year last year, and we believe we are going to be able to meet our responsibilities to water users in the Missouri Basin. But as you move across up into the Pacific Northwest, I think you will see that we are running, again, about average, and that is a good thing. So let's look at the Colorado River region. So if you look at the upper and lower Colorado region, it started off fairly wet, and it has been trending towards drier, though it is supposed to rain the next 3 days in Arizona, but we believe that we are on target to meet all of our responsibilities in the Colorado River Basin given the hydrology this year. But now if we look to the Klamath in southern Oregon, I think you will see that they are significantly below average for their hydrology this year, and it is still early. It is March. A lot could happen between now, March and April. Even May we get storms. Last year we did. But this year is looking like it might be very difficult for the Klamath Basin. And if you look further south into California, you will see that they are significantly below average. It is a very dry year in California to date. Again, we hope that will turn around, but this informs. This is what Reclamation does. This is our responsibility that we can deliver water in a wet year but also in a dry year. The next slide, I just wanted to give you all an idea of what happens to the appropriations you send to the Bureau of Reclamation. So this slide just gives an opportunity to look at geographically where so many of our different projects are going on. These are construction projects across the West. And I want you to know that when this committee and Congress moves forward with appropriations, we are putting your funding to work. This is on-the-ground work that is making water more reliable, is making the Western grid more reliable, and is bringing hydropower to your local communities. So in keeping that as a background, I would just like to highlight for a moment a little bit of our budget as we move forward with fiscal year 2021 recommendation. In the upper basin, the Upper Colorado Basin, we are continually seeking to implement what I call mutually beneficial Tribal settlements. They avoid expensive and contentious litigation, and they are good not only for Tribal nations but also for their neighbors. In fiscal year 2021, we are requesting funding for the Navajo- Gallup Water Supply Project and for the Aamodt Litigation Settlement, as well as others. In the Lower Colorado Basin, home to Hoover Dam, home to Representatives Calvert and Kirkpatrick, our priority remains to continue to address the 20-year drought on the Colorado River Basin using all of our authorities. In the California Great Basin, you can see it holds many challenges this year, and we will be moving forward with partners with those in the basin to move forward to make sure that water can be as reliable as possible. And we have so many other projects across our different regions. I will just conclude by saying thank you to the committee. I am prepared to answer questions. We are very proud of the work we are doing across the West. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Burman follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT TIFF FORMAT] Ms. Kaptur. Thank you, Commissioner Burman, very much. And I thank the Bureau for providing maps that members can understand. Ms. Burman. OK. Ms. Kaptur. With an average seniority level in the Congress now of 6 years or less, we have a lot of education to do, and so we thank you for this and for making us able to speak with our colleagues in a more coherent manner. If you were up here at the dais, you would see how many people, how many members have the map at the top of their stack. So that was very, very good, and we thank you for that. Thank you all for your statements. And as a reminder for those members present in the room, when I gaveled in at the beginning of the hearing, I will recognize you for questions in order of seniority, alternating between majority and minority, until all who arrived prior to the gavel have asked questions. For those who arrive after the hearing has started, I will recognize those members solely in order of arrival, again alternating between majority and minority. Lastly, I intend to observe the 5-minute rule for questions and answers, and we will begin questioning under our normal rules. The first one deals with Brandon Road. And I wanted to ask Secretary James, the Brandon Road Projects, President Trump went back on his word, and since then, Michigan and Illinois are taking a new approach in their efforts to temporarily fund the project with State dollars. Mr. Secretary, it is my understanding that there are two agreements heading to your desk to allow the work to start. Expedited review is essential to ensure the project can proceed during this fiscal year. Can you, will you commit to ensure expedited review of these proposals? Second, we all know that the OMB reviews your work plan and oftentimes overrules your policy and engineering expertise. In your opinion, is the final work plan reflective of the Corps' recommendations based on technical and engineering expertise? Mr. James. There is an agreement in the Division office right now, MVD. It will be coming up to my office very shortly. I understand that Illinois and Michigan did agree to pay $8 million toward this study, which is the PED study, the Pre Engineering and Design, at a cost share of 65/35. It is also my understanding that for the actual construction, I think Illinois is leading the way trying to get other States to buy into the project and actually cost-share some of the construction of the project. You wanted to know about the funding. Ms. Kaptur. Will you commit to ensure expedited review of these proposals? Mr. James. Absolutely. When they reach my office, they are expedited. They have to go through administration review and then I get them back for submission to the Congress, but we expedite them. I made it a point--when I got here and found out that there were still guidance documents from laws you all had passed in 2014 and 2016, it upset me, and we are expediting everything. Ms. Kaptur. All right. I thank you very much. Is the final work plan that will be put forward reflective of the Corps' recommendations based on technical and engineering expertise? We know that OMB often changes things around. And so, therefore, can you affirm that the final work plan is reflective of the Corps' recommendations. Mr. James. As it leaves my office, it is. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much. I will resume my remaining time at a different moment. I would now like to call upon Ranking Member Granger. Ms. Granger. I am sorry, I was still complimenting you on your reply. As I said earlier, we visited the southwest border several times to view the security enhancements. Some call it a fence. Some call it a wall. I called it a fence by mistake, and the President took objection to that, so I call it a wall now, is what you all call it now. I saw that there is a change in the problems, sometimes water problems, sometimes rock problems. It is very difficult to do this and have construction along the Rio Grande where there is miles of border. How do you adjust from one type of issue physically to another? And also, there is a plan for 450 miles of border fencing to be completed by the end of the year, and will you be able to reach that goal? General Semonite. So, ma'am, there is several different types of terrain and different types of environmental factors down there, so what we do, really we have been asked to build this within 3 feet of the border, so, therefore, the location is relatively fixed. But we work for Customs and Border Patrol. They have very, very stringent guidelines that we must follow when it comes to taking care of Native American burial grounds, when it comes to the environment, the water, all the rest. So we actually do what is called the design build. We give the contractor the start and the end. We have them actually do the design. A good example, if there is water that is going to flow through, there are certain structures that have to be able to let that water go underneath and let the debris not get caught up in it. So every section of it, although this is a standard design, it is hand tailored to be able to make sure that it is best applicable to either go up the slopes or be able to take care of those environmental factors. We are very worried about the habitat. There are certain areas where we have got to be able to make sure a habitat can go through it within the confines of still trying to achieve what the administration and CBP is trying to do. And we can certainly go into more details, but there is no one size fits all. It is handcrafted to be able to make sure we are balancing all those competing demands. Ms. Granger. And the other part of the question, there is a plan for 450 miles of border fencing completed by the end of the year. Can you-- General Semonite. We are very aggressive. That is our plan. We think we will still be there. I would like to think we can even beat that. On the other hand, there are times litigation kicks in, and if we have litigation, then unfortunately that will impact the schedule. But our goal is to be exceptionally aggressive and to do everything we can to get to the 450 number. Ms. Granger. Thank you very much. Ms. Kaptur. Ranking Member Simpson. Mr. Simpson. I would yield to Congressman Calvert. He has a Defense hearing at 3. Mr. Calvert. I appreciate that. General, thank you for coming, I appreciate it. And I know the President has probably been calling you weekly about the border wall and how much progress you are making. But I am just curious, 450 miles, is that built or obligated? General Semonite. Sir, that is actually what we expect to have in the ground by the end of the calendar year of 2020. So there is other money that has been obligated that will go into 2021 and even some into 2022. But the 450, that is all obligated and will be built. Mr. Calvert. Is this the money that was displaced out of the Defense budget to go into the wall? Is that what you are going to obligate? General Semonite. Sir, there are a combination of three types of money. Part of it is the regular, normal congressional appropriation the CBP gets; there is another portion which the Secretary of Defense, which is called 284 money; and then there is a third portion which is called 2808 money. So it is a combination of three different types of money. Mr. Calvert. Thank you. I want to be careful how I say these things because I don't want the money that is in Murrieta Creek to end up somewhere else. So with that, I will move on to Murrieta Creek. Secretary James, General, thank you for both being here. I want to talk about Murrieta Creek. I have talked to you both about it many times over the years, and we are, you know, wanting to get this project completed. We have been working closely with Colonel Barta at the L.A. office. And as you know, we are trying to contain costs and available resources, that we use it effectively to get this thing completed. The sponsor, Riverside County Flood Control and the Water Conservation District, has requested a section 221 in-kind contribution for credit agreement to allow the sponsored design phases 2B and 3 of the project. They believe the section 221 agreement would accelerate remaining design work and reduce total project costs. The sponsor has also asked to work closely with the Corps to update the economic side-by-side study of the project. How are we doing on that and what do you expect? General Semonite. Sir, we have a very high standard in the Corps for making sure we are collaborative and we communicate. We missed it on this one. I want to look you in the eye and tell you that. The District let me down on this. And so as a result, we are doing four things. Matter of fact, Mr. Al Lee right here is my new director of Civil Works, he has been on the phone the last couple of days making sure we get this to where it needs to be. Four things. Number 1, we are going to turn the work over to Riverside County by 30 June of this year, and phase 2 will be 21 January of 2021. Number 2, we are going to suspend the work on the GRR and instead we are going to do exactly what you asked, section 221, to be able to let the non-Federal sponsor go ahead and do that design work on their own. Number 3 is we are going to do better partnering. That has always been a goal. But, again, on this one, we didn't do what we needed to do to make sure that you were informed. We even were late answering a letter to you that we should have been much, much more responsive on. And then the fourth one is I have asked Mr. Lee to be able to do a biweekly update, so this District now is not just reporting to the division, they are coming into the headquarters to make sure that we personally track them. We have got a lot--we are doing $66 billion of work this year, but those that are not where we need to be get a extra special little bit of love, and this one is going to get some extra love. Mr. Calvert. God bless you. We need all the love we can get. So thank you for focusing on that. I appreciate that. The mainstem project, any comment on the Santa Ana Main Stem, how we are going to be allocating the supplemental funds, specifically what is in the plan to address the outstanding $161 million for the new official cost estimate? General Semonite. So as you are aware, we have got $17.4 billion as supplemental. This one is a supplemental project. There is some additional growth to this particular project due to some design issues. We have to go figure out where can we do some reallocations. We have got a proposal right now to go to Mr. James and to be able to get his approval to be able to put some additional money. There is a couple of projects that we think we have got a little bit of float on, but we need to go back in and let Mr. James approve that. Our goal is to come in and do the majority of what we were going to do in Santa Ana. But you have got my commitment. This is a very, very important project, and we have got to get Santa Ana done. The question is we are a little bit shy, but we think through the depth of the program we will be able to cover it. Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Kaptur. Congressman Kilmer. Mr. Kilmer. Thanks, Madam Chair. Thanks for being with us. I am not sure if I should direct this to Assistant Secretary James or General Semonite. Coastal communities throughout my district are really struggling with growing threats of coastal erosion and with rising sea levels. I am very grateful that your budget includes $77 million for flood control and for coastal emergencies. And I am particularly grateful for the countless times the Seattle District has rapidly deployed resources to shore up failing jetties or sea walls to prevent a major disaster from occurring, and appreciate them not putting a restraining order out against me and my staff for the number of times that we have called. I recognize those activities come with a significant price tag, and I keep coming to the thought that we are missing an opportunity to make smart investments on the front end in resilience rather than waiting until these structures fail. So in comparison to the $77 million that is requested to respond to these emergencies after they happen, your budget includes $5 million provided for planning and technical assistance to local communities that are trying to reduce their risk of a major flood or coastal hazard event. And, additionally, the Corps has no dedicated resources to help communities that are actually trying to execute what are often small-scale resilience projects that could yield a lot of benefit on the downside. So I was hoping you could talk about the opportunities you see for the Corps to take a more active role in supporting communities who want to invest on the front end in resilience before a disaster occurs and what resources and authorities you already have to support that work and what you might need from Congress to better support that type of work. General Semonite. You are exactly right, the more that we can be proactive up front just pays unbelievable dividends down the road. So this is mainly through planning assistance of States. That is a great program and a little bit of investment with--really, a lot of times, a relatively small amount of money can have unbelievable capabilities. The challenge is, is when you look at the total pot of money, unfortunately, there are so many must funds, things like making locks and dams work and other--some of the projects, that that is one of the accounts that is a little bit light. Anything that Congress could do to give us more money in that particular area, even if it is fenced or dedicated, then we are going to be able to turn that right around, and we will make sure and we will commit to be able to put that where the best return on investment for Congress will be. We are not going to do all of them, but where we see good ones, like the ones you are mentioning, I think there is great merit in doing that. Mr. Kilmer. From an authority standpoint, do you have what you need? General Semonite. I think we do, but I will tell you what, I will take as a task here to double-check that, and if you don't mind, I will get back with you and say what do we need, if there isn't anything on authorities, and maybe even recommend a rough order of magnitude of what do we think within the capability of what we could do so that in future years you could see if you could help us out. Mr. Kilmer. I would really value that. Assistant Secretary James, I am also grateful that your fiscal year 2020 work plan includes $3 million for the Seattle District to proceed with design and cost update for the downstream fish passage facility at the Howard Hanson Dam. As you know, this fish passage facility is just critical for meeting your agency's obligations under the Endangered Species Act, also really essential for recovering some of the key stocks of Chinook that will help, not just worker recovery, but both our Tribal and recreational and commercial fisheries as well. It is essential that the Corps completes the design and cost update quickly so that we can keep the project on track to meet the 2030 deadline set by the biological opinion. Can you tell me when these funds will be made available to the Seattle District, and what is the anticipated timeline for completing the design and the cost update? Mr. James. The funding in the fiscal year 2020 work plan was $3 million for the investigations and $4 million in the President's budget 2021 for the O&M. Now, I don't think the $3 million is going to finish the investigation on that fish passage. It is going to take more funding than that. Mr. Kilmer. What will it take? Mr. James. I don't know. General, do you have any idea what it would take. General Semonite. I don't think I have that here, no, sir. Mr. James. I don't either, but like the General just said, we can get you the number of where we are looking at to date to finish that study and get back to you just as quickly as possible. I don't have it and what that would be. General Semonite. Sir, the main thing we need here is we are real close to 902 limit on this, and so we have to be able to get the report done and be able to make sure that we continue to have the bandwidth to be able to continue to invest in this. So I think that is the main thing that $3 million would do is to get what is called the PACR done so we can have the 902 limit raised. Mr. Kilmer. Thank you. I know I am out of time. Thanks, Madam Chair. Ms. Kaptur. Ranking Member Simpson. Mr. Simpson. Thank you, Chairwoman. As I mentioned in my opening statement, I would like to try to get a little more insight into the Corps' work plan process, particularly in the fiscal year 2020 work plan. General Semonite, as I understand it, the first draft of the work plan is developed by subject matter experts in the District Division, and headquarters offices, culminating in your recommended work plan to the assistant secretary. Is that correct. General Semonite. It is, sir. Mr. Simpson. Can you please briefly describe how you prioritize projects for funding in your recommended work plan? What kind of quantitative and qualitative metrics do you use? General Semonite. So, first of all, we put a lot of effort in the work plan. It is not something we do in 2 or 3 weeks. We spend 6 or 7 months on it. We are starting the work plan for next year right now. So every one of the requirements that we can't get funded, those go through a very, very critical analysis. And you talk about the metrics. I am going to give you five. Number 1, risk to public safety; No. 2, legal mandates; No. 3, national security; No. 4, economic and environmental return on investment; and, number five, we are going to finish what we start. So those are how we bin those, and we are engineers, so I hate to say we have a great big matrix and they all kind of rack and stack accordingly. The other thing, though, is that as much as you can have great metrics, what is most important here is your gut. And so I go to the division commanders about 2 months out and I say, I want to know your top three to five projects that you really think this Nation needs to be able to invest in. And they write me a personal email, I give it to General Spellmon, sitting right behind me, and I say, let's get as many of these as we can. Now, sometimes they might want $80 million but their capability is only 30. But the bottom line is we go out of our way to be able to make that--that work plan is based on engineering and science. We don't worry about boundaries. We don't worry about politics. We are trying to do what is best for America. Mr. Simpson. Thank you. If we include districts, divisions, headquarters, approximately how many technical experts are involved in developing what becomes your recommended work plan? Would you say it is in the hundreds? General Semonite. Sir, it is probably over 2,000. Mr. Simpson. Assistant Secretary James, as I understand the process, after the Chief of Engineers sends your recommended work plan to you, you have a handful of people in your office who review it as well. Is that correct? Mr. James. Yes, sir, that is correct. Mr. Simpson. Do you make any changes to what the chief recommends? And if you do, would you characterize the scope of changes as minor or significant? Mr. James. Most changes I make in my office are policy type changes, if I see something that is interfering with a policy that we need to follow that maybe the Corps missed. But we make very few changes because my management and budget staff are in hourly contact with the chief's staff over there as they and we are developing the work plan. So there is very little daylight between us when I get the work plan. Mr. Simpson. Then once you have your recommended work plan, you send it on to OMB where a handful of people review it as well. Is that correct? Mr. James. Yes. Mr. Simpson. General Semonite, was the final fiscal year 2020 work plan submitted to the committee identical to your original recommended work plan? If it was not, would you characterize the scope of changes as minor or significant? General Semonite. Sir, I would say that it was not identical, and I would say that the changes are significant. And I would also say that what Mr. James said, this is not where we develop it, we send it to him and we don't see it anymore. Every day we are talking back and forth. And there are times where I might walk in and say we need a little bit more money here and there, and probably more than any other work plan, it has been seamless between the two different offices that we have provided a product that we would put our name on to say this is a good investment. Mr. Simpson. So it seems to me that we have a process that allows for a handful of people at OMB, who may or may not have any engineering or construction experience, to override the judgment of hundreds of people who have been hired specifically for their subject matter expertise. This is not a good situation. I believe Congress needs to do something about it, and I have several ideas I plan to discuss further with my colleagues. Additionally, I am concerned that the fiscal year 2020 work plan is not in compliance with the direction provided in the Act. General Semonite, in fiscal year 2020, the 2020 Act included language providing you as the Chief of Engineers with the authority to determine which projects are eligible for funding under which categories. I assume your original work plan recommended to the assistant secretary was consistent with your determination and congressional direction provided in the bill and report. Is that correct? General Semonite. Definitely. Mr. Simpson. Were you provided the opportunity to confirm whether or not the final work plan also was consistent with the direction in the bill and prior report to it being submitted to the committee? General Semonite. No. Primarily, sir, because this was done in so much flux that even up to the day that we made the announcement of the work plan, there were still being changes being made that morning. We just couldn't get all of that level of fidelity. Mr. Simpson. Were you given any explanation for how you were supposed to fulfill your statutory responsibility if you weren't even given sufficient time to review the significant changes in the work plan before it was finalized and submitted to the committee? General Semonite. Sir, we were not given any additional guidance, no. Mr. Simpson. Thank you. Yield back. Ms. Kaptur. Congresswoman Frankel. Ms. Frankel. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you to all of you for your service. Appreciate it. Let me just start and make a comment that I think, given the economic stress that this country is under, this is not a time to cut back the Army Corps budget, other than--and I say this with probably no respect--I don't think we should be spending money on that stupid bigoted border wall, which I think is a name, but no comments necessary on your part. Secretary James, I know that the marine industry would agree with you on taking a look at the cost-benefit analysis, because they believe that there are a lot of issues associated with the marine industry that is not taken into account. But I have some local issues I would rather get your comment on, unless you feel--OK. I would just wanted to pass that on. Mr. James. Well, my feeling on that, I didn't dream it one night. You are exactly right, Congresswoman. That is from years of dealing with people in both the inland navigation, the harbor people on the coast, and people seeking flood control in this country. We have still got people that get flooding, just like the Missouri River did last year, and those are the people that cannot get projects because their benefit-cost ratio is too low to be funded. Ms. Frankel. All right. Thank you for looking at that. I want to ask a couple of questions. In terms of the Central Everglades Planning Project, the Army Corps' position, do you believe that a new start is necessary for each individual project? General Semonite. Yes, ma'am. Our counsel has looked at this several times and, unfortunately, that is the current position of our lawyers. Ms. Frankel. First of all, I want to also thank you for the additional funding that you are requesting. On the--you probably know about the controversy in Palm Beach County, in Martin County concerning the lake level of Lake Okeechobee. So this year, it is my understanding that this year, that you allowed the lake to go 2 feet below this average, if you are following that. There is a very big fear, especially in the cities and the counties, that we are going to go to a drought. I was mayor when we had a terrible drought, and we almost lost our water. It is also a concern of the agriculture community. So I am just--first of all, do you expect that we are going to have to have any drought measures? And is this going to be something that you are going to be doing every year? General Semonite. We don't expect any drought, ma'am. Again, we think a couple of years ago we probably came in too high on how much water was in the lake. Last year, we went low mainly to be able to dechampion or to be able to not have the algae blooms. That worked very, very well. This year, we are going to go a little bit higher. I don't have the number of it, but I think you are aware of, we have some very, very strict protocols of how we work the lake levels. We are right in the middle of redoing that, so we have a little bit better table to be able to make sure that everybody knows what is going to happen with the lake level. We do not see a significant problem this year. Ms. Frankel. OK. That is good. And, Madam Chair, just to remind the committee and also the Corps that last year, in our bill, we put language which encouraged the Corps to use the best available science to determine appropriate lake levels. So I would hope that we will have that again, Madam Chair, and that you will be doing that. General Semonite. We are going to do it regardless of what the language is, ma'am. We are going to put the best science we have. Ms. Frankel. All right. And just I want to ask you in terms of some of our projects, whether they are on schedule. Herbert Hoover Dike? General Semonite. Yes, ma'am, on schedule. Ms. Frankel. On schedule. How about the Midtown Beach renourishment? I know there has been some back and forth on that. How is that going? General Semonite. I don't believe I have that one, but I will get back with you on Midtown. Ms. Frankel. OK. That would be great. And what about--with the Everglades restoration, can you give me an update on, you know, the completion on that? General Semonite. Overall, I think we are in a very, very good place. And Congress has done a great job of investing in it in the last several years. We have seen a lot of new starts. We have seen a lot of projects being done. We continue to be able to get a very, very good investment on the money that is going back in there. So there is no specific challenges out there. The main thing we are doing is we want to be able to make sure we work the EAA Reservoir, because that is a critical part of making sure the water flow goes in the Everglades. And that is back to your question about the new start. Ms. Frankel. Yes. General Semonite. And this is where that is going to have, I would think, in a WRDA, it could have, you know, some language, and then in the work plan for 2021, that would be a good place to be able to put a new start in the 2021 work plan. Ms. Frankel. OK. So you are suggesting that we try to do that? General Semonite. We need to get that EAA Reservoir done, ma'am. Ms. Frankel. OK. Then I want to ask you about Port Everglades, not Everglades restoration, Port Everglades, which is a port that accepts cargo and so forth. It received the new start, thank you for that, in last year's Army Corps work plan and $29 million to start moving the Coast Guard station. Any estimate on when actual new construction will start at the port and how long it is going to take to complete the first step, and then how much more money will be needed in the construction account for the entire project? General Semonite. So this one did get a new start. That is good news. The next big thing is the project partnership agreement. We expect that to come in sometime in December, and that will be a--that is good news. And then we have got to do a supplemental NEPA because we have got some ESA issues out there. That will be done, I think, this September. And then when it comes down to what we think the actual construction, what I will do is I will have my guys lay out--I have got a beautiful graphic here. We will lay out exactly what the deliverables are. But at the end of the day, the biggest thing we are worried about is coral. You know what happened in Miami. Ms. Frankel. Yes. General Semonite. So we want to make sure we do this right. And we have got a new dredging methodology, so when we dredge out Port Everglades, we don't see anywhere near the risk to the coral that has been experienced in the past. Ms. Frankel. Good. Thank you. That is excellent. I yield back. General Semonite. $238 million is what it is going to need at the end. Ms. Frankel. Is that total money for both State and Federal or is that the Federal? General Semonite. That is the Federal, the balance to complete. We have already spent about $29 million, so that is about the rough order of magnitude. Ms. Frankel. What portion of that is of the project? General Semonite. I think that is 65 percent. Ms. Frankel. OK. Thank you so much. Ms. Kaptur. Congressman Newhouse. Mr. Newhouse. Thank you, Madam Chair, Ranking Member Simpson. First of all, welcome to all of you this afternoon. It is always a pleasure to have you in front of us. My first questions I direct toward the Army Corps, so Assistant Secretary James and Lieutenant General Semonite. The hardworking men and women that you have on your team at the Army Corps of Engineers, as you know, have been conducting an extensive study of the operations of the Columbia River system. I think it has been over 3 years now. They have been doing so in conjunction with several other agencies, Federal scientists, engineers, fish biologists, and experts of these agencies have been drafting a comprehensive analysis of the operations of the system and its impacts on the environment, fish and wildlife, the economy, and certainly the communities across the region. So thank you for your efforts there. Since the release of that draft EIS, I believe it was February 28, I have been doing everything possible to encourage community members, regional stakeholders as well throughout the Northwest, to engage, make sure the general public takes the opportunity that they have during this 45-day comment period to provide their input. This is an open and transparent process. The document is public and available for everyone to review, and anyone can lend their voice and offer feedback through official comment. There are a series of public meeting meetings. One of them is in my district at the Kennewick Red Lion, just make sure it is on the record, on Wednesday, March 18, from 4 to 8 p.m. There will be others throughout the Northwest. In my view, members of our community, the everyday citizen must engage in this process because of the importance the river system has, truly the profound effects it has on the lives of every single person who lives in the Columbia Basin region and certainly the Greater Northwest. We must hear these voices of the people that are impacted. I recently received--and I will just hold it up so you can see from a distance--this was an email, a hard copy of an email from an environmental organization, and in my humble opinion, had the gall to fundraise off this Federal review process. You don't see average community members doing that, fundraising off of this process. You don't see everyday citizens raising money on a scientific review that will, like I said, have profound impacts on the daily lives, the livelihoods of millions of people in the region. That is why I believe the public process is so important. That is why I believe more dialogue is so important, but dialogue based on science and facts, not on political antics like this. That is why, for example, I recently invited the Governor of Oregon to come to one of our world-class hydroelectric dams in Central Washington, to engage with scientists, to engage with experts on the facts, not on politics. I was disappointed to learn just yesterday that the Governor will not be able to join me on this opportunity, but I will commit to doing everything in my power to continue to engage in a constructive dialogue with community leaders, members of the region that make decisions, while continuing to encourage the public to offer their comments. And just let me help by inserting a plug right here, anyone can go to crso.info and provide comments. So with that long background, I thank you for engaging-- allowing me to do that. Mr. Secretary, Lieutenant General, I would simply welcome you to share some of the facts on how this process has developed, share some of the background on the Federal resources and effort that went into drafting this EIS. And any information that you could share about your efforts moving forward would be appreciated. General Semonite. I will keep it real short, but the bottom line is we want to do this right. It is a very, very complicated equation. There are a lot of different variables, and they all compete against each other. We have got a great relationship with Bureau of Rec, a lot of other key players out there. And so what we have got to do is be able to continue to go through this comment period, because the time is short, and we have got to get this EIS done by the end of the next year. We don't think we can extend the comment period, but we are very, very receptive to be able to make sure that everybody is telling us what those ramifications are. And then, again, at the end of the day, it is about how do we balance the environment with all of the other needs like navigation, hydropower, and irrigation. Mr. Newhouse. Thank you. Secretary James, any comment that you would like to provide? Mr. James. No. Just for the record, though, I think this whole enterprise is--for the environmental discovery for other--another project, right, for the 14 power dams that are supposed or proposed. And what we are talking about here today is the environmental impact statement on what will or will those dams not do to the environment. Am I not right? Mr. Newhouse. Primarily. Just the future operations of the Columbia/Snake River system. Mr. James. Yes, sir. I am like General Semonite, we are all in on getting this EIS finished so the project, whatever the mitigation is, we can move on with it and get things going out there. Mr. Newhouse. Finally, yes. Mr. James. Yes, sir. Mr. Newhouse. I appreciate that. Mr. James. Yes, sir. Mr. Newhouse. I appreciate your commitment to seeing this through to the end in a positive way. Thank you. With that, Madam Chair, I am sorry, I went over time. I yield back. Ms. Kaptur. Congresswoman Kirkpatrick. Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Thank you, Madam Chairman. And I thank everyone here before being before the committee. And, Commissioner Burman, I especially want to thank you for meeting with me yesterday. I really appreciated your time. And so, you know, we know Arizona and the West are headed toward a drought, and I just want to ask you, you know, what do you think the chances are that, you know, the drought contingency plan will kick in, and what are Reclamation's plans and strategies to address the drought that we know is coming this year? Ms. Burman. So, as you know, the Colorado River is so important to Arizona and to the seven basin States and Mexico who rely on it. We have been in a 20-year drought on the Colorado River. That is the deepest drought that we have seen in the recorded history of the Colorado River and one of the worst droughts that we have seen in the Paleo Record. But what we have done, the incredible work that was done on the drought contingency plans and the help from Congress last year to pass that legislation, is really remarkable. But what happened at that same time was also, last year, was an above- average year on the system, and we are blessed with incredible infrastructure on the Colorado River. So we were able to capture the water from that wet year, and that has been a significant help. In addition, the drought contingency plans incentivized conservation and the basin States together were able to save almost a million acre feet behind Hoover Dam last year. So that has put us in a very good position. So for 2020, there will not be a shortage on the Colorado River. We are in a place we call tier zero underneath the drought contingency plans, and that means there are some contributions by Arizona, by Nevada, and by Mexico. But when we look ahead to 2021, we also do not expect to see a shortage in 2021. Anything could happen if this year stays very dry. The chances would go up, but we think the chances are fairly small in the--like 11 to 15 percent chance of a shortage next year. And they start to go up from there. In 2022, they are looking more at that 11 to 15 percent. 2023, they go up more, 37 to 45 percent, but not to throw a bunch of numbers around. But I would say we are in a very good position because of conservation last year, because of incentives from the DCP that were allowed to happen, and because it was an above-average year. So we look good for this year and next year. Mrs. Kirkpatrick. That is really good news. You know, Arizona is supposed to be getting 3 days of rain this week. So we certainly welcome that. But thank you for your leadership, and we will certainly stay in touch. I yield back. Ms. Burman. Thank you. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you. Ranking Member Simpson. Mr. Simpson. Thank you, Chairwoman. I wasn't going to say anything about this, but it is always a fascinating discussion on the Columbia River Basin. I notice you all mentioned hydropower, irrigation, and transportation, how important those are. Nobody mentioned fish. Nobody mentioned salmon that come back to Idaho that, if in the next 15 years something isn't done, they will be extinct. There is no doubt about that. They will be extinct. So we can talk about all that. And we never talked about the 487,000-acre feet of water that Idaho sends out of my district down to flush salmon over those dams, and the one thing they are not doing is recovering salmon, but they are keeping water in the pool so that we can irrigate in Washington. So we sometimes have a little different take on this. Representative Newhouse and I could sit here for hours and talk about this. I understand how important that is to his district. And I guess if you don't live in an area where the Olympians of salmon come back to spawn in Idaho, then you really don't care about it. But people better start looking at this seriously, and any plan we come up with, any EIS, had better recover salmon. Now they got a new plan out here the flexible spill thing. The one thing it will not do is speed up the migration of salmon to the Pacific Ocean, which is now about twice as long as it used to be. We don't have a Columbia River anymore. We have a series of pools the fish now have to swim to. It takes them twice as long, warmer water, more predators. We are not looking at the whole picture here. We are trying to preserve what exists instead of saying, what do we want to do for the next 20 or 40 years? What do we want this to look like in 20 or 40 years? Do the people of the Pacific Northwest want to lose the salmon runs? If you do, then fine. Make the determination. Let's quit spending $750,000 a year--million dollars a year every year now by the ratepayers at Bonneville Power to recover salmon. It is just not working. People have got to get out of their niches and start looking at what we want to do in the future. That was a subject that I wasn't going to bring up, but as you can tell, I feel a little passionately about it. Assistant Secretary James and General Semonite, as you know, the 2008 compensatory mitigation rule established a hierarchy of mitigation with a preference for the use of wetland banks, which was established--which have established credits already in place as approved by the Corps. According to the publicly available data, there is a wide disparity of the use of mitigation banks against--across Corps districts. Do you know what is causing that disparity, and do you agree that it would be useful to take a look at this issue to see if there are majors that would provide better consistency and adherence to the hierarchy in the rule? Mr. James. I will let General Semonite elaborate on that, but from my understanding, there is not enough wetland mitigation banks in our country right now, and the Corps is working on that. They are working with individuals and other public entities to raise the number. The other thing is, is in some areas of the country, in some Corps of Engineer district areas, the people there for one reason or another would rather have their mitigation in the area of the project. Not everybody wants to buy from a mitigation bank, and as we all know, once they put in a mitigation bank, you better get your wallet out because the mitigation is going to cost you. Mr. Simpson. Yes. Mr. James. And that is the reasons that I know of personally. That is not in my policy head. These are just things that I picked up over my years of service here. Mr. Simpson. OK. General Semonite. Sir, we certainly are looking at this right now. We want to continue to look at it and have a dialogue with you. Three main reasons why there is some disparity out there, and these banks are all based on every part of the country is a little bit different. First of all, what functions are needed in the watershed? What is environmentally preferable for offsetting functions lost through permitted impacts? And, finally, the availability of mitigation bank credits. It is kind of like the secretary said. This goes back to it has got be a tailored solution, and sometimes what might work in the Northwest doesn't work in the Southeast. But we are looking down through. There are some incentives we are looking at right now. We are trying to study this, and if we can find a way of doing this better, we are all in. Mr. Simpson. Thank you. Commissioner Burman, the budget request includes a bit of a reduction for Indian Water Rights Settlements overall, although some individual projects go up. What is the reason for the decreases? Is it due to the availability of mandatory funding? And at the request levels, are all the settlements on track to meet statutory deadlines? Ms. Burman. Absolutely. Representative Simpson, Ranking Member Simpson, we absolutely are committed to our tribal obligations, and you see that in our budget. This past year, 2020, is the first year that mandatory funding through the Reclamation Settlement Fund has become available, and that is about $120 million a year. And so we have been able to put that to work this year. We announced that about a month ago, where that funding would be going for this year. So when you look at our budget for 2021, it is to meet our responsibilities, and we have many settlements, many settlements that must be funded and complete by 2025. We believe we are on target. It is tough. It is difficult, but we are moving forward with those projects, and we do believe we are on target to meet our responsibilities. Mr. Simpson. Let me just ask you, the budget request reduces funding for the authorized rural water projects. Some of these projects have components benefiting Tribes. How do the Tribes' projects' components factor into the budget request for rural water projects? Ms. Burman. On the rural water project program, first and foremost, we meet our existing responsibilities, meaning our O&M, our operation and maintenance responsibilities. That is overwhelmingly on the Tribal side. Next, we look at the different projects that need construction, and we do look at our Tribal responsibilities as we move forward with that. I think you will see from our 2020 spend plan that we were able to put significant resources provided by Congress towards all of those rural water supply projects, and they are moving forward. Mr. Simpson. Thank you. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you, Mr. Simpson. Commissioner Burman, Reclamation's 2020 work plan includes $8 million for Shasta Dam being raised, despite Congress specifically not including WIIN Act funding for this project. Will all fiscal year 2020 funds be used only for planning, design, and preconstruction activities with no funds used for any construction activities? Is that correct? Ms. Burman. That is right. The $8 million provided in the reclamation spend plan that was sent to Congress on February 3 for fiscal year 2020 includes $8 million for Shasta Dam to move forward, and that is under preconstruction activity. So we are completing design. We are doing the testing we need to do to know if that project is viable and can it move forward. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you for that clarification. Secretary James and General Semonite, the Great Lakes navigation system is just that, a system, and thankfully, that navigation system received over 10 percent of the entire Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund expenditures for operation and maintenance each year from 2014 through fiscal year 2019. Last year, however, the Great Lakes navigation system saw a precipitous dip in funding, receiving only 8.9 percent of O&M funding. Can you walk us through the reason for that change and why the Great Lakes received just under 9 percent of the entire operation and maintenance funding in this fiscal year of 2020 versus 12.4 percent in fiscal year 2019? What has changed in the Great Lakes or national landscape to warrant this reduction? Mr. James. Madam Chairwoman, I would have to check that out with experts and get back to you as soon as possible. I don't have that. Ms. Kaptur. All right. You know, with all of the extra waterfall and so forth, we have docks underwater. We have a lot of seawall collapse. There is just a lot of flooding all over the Great Lakes region at 124-year high of rainfall in the region. So I would appreciate your getting back to us as soon as you can. Thank you so much. Mr. James. Madam Chairwoman, let me make sure I am on the right study. Is that the coastal resiliency that you are talking about or-- Ms. Kaptur. No. This really has to do with the allocation of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund to different--we are a creature of that, and the significant reduction in funding was just 9 percent of the entire O&M funding this year versus 12.4 percent in fiscal year 2019. So we are curious, what actually happened to cause that aberration downward in a fund that has-- -- Mr. James. I will get that to you immediately. Thank you. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you. Thank you very much. And to both of you, again, thank you so much for prioritizing the Soo Locks. Your budget request for 2021 is at a solid level. And can you please give us an update on that project and make sure that it is actually delivered on time and on budget? Are we still on track to complete the project with the total estimated cost of $922 million, and will the 2021 project request keep us on track toward that goal? General Semonite. Madam Chairwoman, the answer is yes. The bottom line is you got three parts of it. Upstream channel deepening, the upstream approach walls, and the new lock chamber. The work plan money of $125 million is on capability where we need to be. And then the 2021 budget gives us another $123 million. So that is capability as well. And then what we will do is we will start construction oversight of the upstream channel deepening soon so we can get that part going and get the other two and continue to be able to get moving. So we don't see a problem with the overall total that you mentioned. We think that is right on track. And if there is ever a time when Soo Locks gets out of balance, I will personally come see you, because this is a critical project. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much. Secretary James. Mr. James. And I feel exactly the same way. That is one of the first projects I visited when I came into this job was Soo Locks. And when it was explained to me what a priority it is for this country, the taconite that comes out of Minnesota across the Great Lakes and through Soo Locks, you only have one lock, no redundancy, and then the story about soldiers and anti-aircraft gun being stationed there during World War II to protect that. So it should be a national priority to get that other lock finished and in operation. General Semonite. Fall of 2026 is when we expect to have it done. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary and General. General Semonite, are there any Corps resources or workers that would otherwise work on Civil Works projects being directed to work on the border wall? General Semonite. No, ma'am. We have a wide variety of different types of skills. There are some that work military missions and some that work civil works, but there is also a repository of engineering and construction people. So there are times we lean on different types of skill sets to be able to do all of our different work, but right now, because you allow us to hire up, whatever the workload is--I don't have a fixed manning document--we are able to hire whatever we need to do to be able to take care. We are doing $8 billion for the VA right now. I love working for the VA. We build hospitals for the VA. There is nobody coming off of Civil Works projects because they are diverted to some other project. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you for that clarification. I was greatly disappointed that your 2020 work plan did not include a new start in funding for the Great Lakes Coastal Resiliency Study. Assistant Secretary James, why wasn't this important effort funded in the 2020 work plan? Can you clarify? Mr. James. I cannot clarify, I think, to your satisfaction. I can clarify due to the fact that it was not in the top priority of the budget, and that is--when I get those from the Corps, as we talked to before, as I get them from the general, then they are gone over with the administration. Sometimes they are reprioritized. Sometimes they are not. But then the administration's budget comes out of that. Ms. Kaptur. General, would you wish to comment on that? General Semonite. We continue to see unbelievable value in this study, and we will continue to be an advocate for this study wherever we can. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much. Congresswoman Frankel. Ms. Frankel. OK. Would you like to ask questions? You just came in. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. I am good. Ms. Frankel.OK. Thanks. First of all, I thank you all again. I really like your approach. Very commonsense. On the--OK. Let me get back to the Everglades restoration. So this is--and back to the water level, which is such a controversy in my area, because what is happening, as I think you know, in parts of south Florida, they are having the green algae in the water, which is very disruptive to them. And the folks like where I live in Palm Beach County and the cities, they are all worried about not having enough water. So it is, like, the people in Martin County, they don't want too much water in the lake, and then people south of them are afraid of too little in the lake. I am sure you get that back and forth. So this question is related to that. In WRDA 2000, when approving the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, Congress included a provision called the savings clause, and this provision prohibited the Corps from changing water supply to utilities, agriculture, and other Lake Okeechobee water users when completing the restoration projects. Now, my local folks, again, in Palm Beach County are very anxious about what is going to be the new, what you call LOSOM, the Lake Okeechobee System Operating Manual, which I guess will guide on how high the lake should be. And they are very anxious about that, and they are requesting that there be some kind of a saving clause in this new schedule. And I would just like you to comment on that, the practicality of that, the pros, the cons. General Semonite. Ma'am, I don't personally know the savings clause with respect to Lake Okeechobee, but let me figure it out. The main thing we want to do is be very, very open and willing to, you know, take any ideas. This study is not going to be done until 2022. So we have got 2 years. We are doing a lot of outreach. And if there is something that we are legally allowed to do and it makes sense, then we will certainly take a good, hard look at it. Ms. Frankel. Well, that is very good. Thank you for taking a look at that. General Semonite. Sure. Ms. Frankel. You might want to sit around the table with some of these folks and understand their concern. I am sure you will do that. Mr. James. Congresswoman, I can tell you are sincerely concerned about that area, the Lake Okeechobee area. Ms. Frankel. Yeah. Mr. James. And I understand that. I have fished Lake Okeechobee for probably 25 years in the wintertime, before I took this job, of course, but I am quite familiar with the area and I am quite familiar what your concerns are. I will tell you this, ecologically we think between 12\\1/2\\ foot and 15\\1/2\\ foot is probably the right spot to be. And the other thing I wanted you to know is that we have ERDC, the Engineer Research and Development Center--thank you-- working on the algae and how to get rid of the algae, dissolve the algae, or whatever we can do, in case we have the problem we did year before last again. I made a trip to Florida during that time just to see that, and it was distressing for everyone I ran into down there. So I want you to know we are watching it. Ms. Frankel. OK. Thank you so much. Another question sort of related. Another group is concerned about the large number of aquifer--the ASR, aquifer storage and recovery, wells that are being proposed for the upcoming Lake Okeechobee Watershed Restoration Project that is north of the lake. They are concerned that not enough water will be able to move south if it is stored belowground. My question: Have you heard about these concerns, and your response of that? General Semonite. I have not. Let us blow into it and come back and let you know. I am sure my guys on the ground probably do. But we are worried that if there is enough--if there is a lot of draw out of the aquifer, what you are talking about could be exactly true. So this is where we got to put that into the equation. Ms. Frankel. OK, good. So thank you for taking that into account. And then finally in my last 13 seconds, Secretary James, back to that cost-benefit analysis, just to remind you that OMB, that their cost analysis is almost always different than the Army Corps. And I don't know how you can figure that one out, but-- Mr. James. Well, let me tell you, that is two different things. OMB's reasoning behind their benefit-cost ratio and analysis, it is different, because to authorize a project, the benefit-cost ratio has to be 1.0 and above. Now, the administration's viewpoint is, to appropriate money for a project, it has to be 2.5 and above. And I am not arguing to change that. I mean, I am not saying the administration needs to change that. What I am saying is that the individual needs of this country, if you have got a project, whether it be navigation or flood control, we need to get all your benefits. We don't need to be just cherry-picking the easy ones over the top and get to the 1.1 and quit. Ms. Frankel. Got it. Mr. James. We need to get up to where it is cost effective for appropriation. Ms. Frankel. OK. Mr. James. And we are--a lot of projects we are not doing that. I don't know. I may discover as we get further in that with the general that they are taking all the benefits. Personally, right now, I don't think so, and we are going to be looking at it. Ms. Frankel. OK. Well, that might solve that issue. But thank you very much. I yield back, Madam Chair. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much. Congressman Newhouse. Mr. Newhouse. Thank you, Madam Chair. I want to ask Commissioner Burman and Secretary Petty a little bit about the Columbia Basin Project. And I wasn't going to do this but it came up, so I want to respond a little bit. Some people probably think that Mr. Simpson and I have an ongoing conflict. It is true there are potatoes in Idaho, but there are great potatoes in Washington as well, and I always have to remind him of that. However, the whole notion of looking at the Columbia/Snake River system in a holistic manner in order to prioritize salmon is something that we are all interested in, and I want to have that conversation on how to address the many challenges that we have in that river system, even the spill of water from the Idaho dams. You know, we do, Mr. Simpson is absolutely right, we invest a ton of money into that system every year, but we have seen a lot of good results as well, an improved habitat, improved passage at the dams, the tremendous amount of work on the turbines and their efficiency and the high passage rate, survivability rate of the salmon through those. We are working on the predators issues, the Forest bill thing, which the jury is still out on that, as far as I can tell. But we are looking at different things in order to increase salmon survivability. All that being said, there were intentional decisions made, if you look back in history in the State of Idaho, that salmon were not welcome. So when they get through all the dams, through the Columbia and the Snake River in Washington, guess what? Through much of the system they run into a concrete barrier, because spawning salmon just don't want to take a hook and they want a trout. So decisions were made way back in the history. So I admit we have got challenges, but I think through positive conversations, we can meet those challenges and come up with solutions so that the proof is that dams and salmon can coexist, and I think we are living that and we are proving that every day. Can we do better? Absolutely, but I think we can. I think we will. But I do want to talk a little bit about the Columbia Basin Project as well. First, just start by saying, Commissioner Burman, you are doing a great job. You are doing a great job leading the Bureau, and I am really grateful to have such an enthusiastic partner in advocating for water needs, not just in the Pacific Northwest, but all over the western United States. You are thoroughly engaged. You are responsive to questions that we have been bugging you with over the last few years. I appreciate that. It really does make a difference when we have somebody on the front line that recognizes how valuable of a resource water is to all our rural communities and such a critical component to our economy, our growth, and our prosperity. So thank you. Thank you very much. Don't get to say that very often. Mr. Petty, for your efforts as well, both of you, you know, the Columbia Basin District, the project in my district well, particularly the importance of something that I think has captured the attention of the chair of the committee, the Odessa Groundwater Replacement Program. I have discussed it many times, and I am pleased to have Chairman Kaptur's interest in this as well. What I would like to ask both of you here today is to share with me some insights that I could bring back to my community members in my district. Something I often share with them when they come to DC and make the trip to talk about these issues is the importance of speaking with one voice. You know, the Federal Government is vast. The bureaucracy is sometimes confusing even to us, right? It can be burdensome. So I believe it is critical that when farmers or local elected officials or water advocates or community leaders come to D.C., that their message be singular and unified. I don't want to provide you the answer that I am looking for, but when we have these tremendous advocates from the Pacific Northwest come and the partnerships between organizations like the Columbia Basin Development League, the Washington State Department of Agriculture, the collaboration of the Office of Columbia River, the regional Bureau of Reclamation offices and so on, these partnerships and collaboration is what will move the ball forward in this important effort, at least in my humble opinion. I'd like to ask you to share your thoughts on the importance of ensuring a unified vision amongst these many shared entities. Mr. Petty. Yeah. Let me kick that off, Congressman. Thank you so very much in the important part of just how the Columbia plays into each of the different regions and specifically into your region. The whole Columbia Basin and the Snake come through your district, and you don't--you know it better than anyone on all these systems that come through. But one of the key parts that I just want to highlight is the importance of the relationship between the Army Corps, Bonneville, and Reclamation, and Interior as a whole. And it is the interaction that we get all the time, including the draft EIS, the Army Corps, we designate it as that one Federal lead so that we could work through it together. And it was the importance of, if we don't all succeed individually, kind of we all end up hanging together. And so with the Army Corps being able to be right there in the front, making sure that all the science, all the decades of work that we put in to develop these different areas all the way down to Odessa, the need for surface water, as well as subsurface water, is critical, including working with your State and the local State water districts as well. Those are all incredibly important areas. So I will let the commissioner kind of finish off any thoughts that she has as well. But thank you. Ms. Kaptur. I would just like to draw attention to the witnesses, we have been called for votes, and we think it is a series of this first vote and then another. So, Commissioner Burman, if you could briefly summarize. And we have another member who has come in and is waiting to question. Ms. Burman. Of course. I will just agree with everything Dr. Petty said. And moving forward with the one Federal decision model has been very--it has been great for all of us just to be able to talk things out and move forward. On the Odessa project, it is so important. It is designed to help rural communities in eastern Washington, and it is locally driven. The State is a partner. The district is a partner. We are a partner. We are all moving forward. And that project, you know, we are hoping we will be delivering water this year. Mr. Newhouse. The importance of having a single voice coming to D.C., you would agree, is something we have to have too. Ms. Burman. Absolutely. Mr. Petty. Absolutely. Mr. Newhouse. Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you. The gentleman's time has expired. Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Thank you, Madam Chair. Secretary James and General Semonite, thank you very much on behalf of the whole Florida delegation. We were thrilled that a new start was awarded so that we could begin the $29 million in construction funding that was needed for the fiscal year 2020 work plan on the Everglades restoration. It is a long time in coming. And, Secretary James, we appreciate you coming down and taking a look at what our needs were as well, as well as Port Everglades. We are very proud that we have come together as a delegation to pressure the President to request the kind of funding that we need for Everglades restoration, and I certainly hope the $250 million becomes the new Federal funding floor, not the ceiling. As you all know, Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, or CERP, was authorized by Congress in 2000. We learned this week that the State legislature is getting ready to appropriate $100 million for their end of the bargain, getting closer to the 50/50 partnership that we have been since the beginning of this century. We have a number of the approximately 60 projects in CERP that are nearing completion, including the C-43 and C-44 Reservoirs and the Picayune Strand Project. We have also made great progress on non-CERP projects like the Herbert Hoover Dike restoration and Kissimmee River. So could you report on the CERP projects nearing completion? Because after so much work of the Federal and State investment, we really need to start moving to ribbon cuttings as soon as we can and celebrate the few projects that we have gotten across the finish line. So where are we in terms of the projects that are nearing completion so we can do that? General Semonite. Ma'am, let me just say a couple of highlights. So complete construction of Kissimmee River this year, construction of C-111, South Dade, this year; complete Everglades Agricultural Area follow-up report and submitted to Secretary James in May of 2020, and that is one we know that is very, very important. C-43 West Basin Storage Reservoir, that will complete in 2023. And then just the last one that is important, Indian River Lagoon, that is done in 2022. And the one that we really want to continue to keep pushing is the EAA, to be able to make sure we get that reservoir done, and that does need a new start. Congressman Frankel asked just before you came in. Our lawyers do say that the way that the authorities are set, we are going have to get a new start for that. So I encourage the committee to do it because we are all ready to go. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. And I would say in the nicest way possible that we don't agree, but we have been around that block before. If the committee appropriates the full $250 million, either the Assistant Secretary or the General, that we have requested for fiscal year 2021, will the Army Corps be able to spend those funds, and do you already have a plan to do so? General Semonite. We don't see any problem right now on the ability to put all that in the ground. I don't have the exact plan with me, but let us come back to you and lay this out so you can see exactly what is out there. And if for some reason that is not in line with what the rest of the delegation would like, then we can certainly take a look at monitoring that or changing that. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Thank you. That would be very helpful. I am concerned about the bureaucratic obstacles that were just referenced about the need for new starts in projects that, you know, overall were already authorized. So would you say that the limitation on the number of new starts--I know you just indicated the, you know, wrapping up of these projects-- but would you say that the limitation on the number of new starts would impact or delay Everglades projects in fiscal year 2021? General Semonite. I do think that there will be some impact with the limited number of new starts we get, yes. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. OK. Well, it would be great if we could revisit the way that this is interpreted, because it really doesn't make sense to many of us. Touching on CEPP and the EAA reservoir as top priorities for Everglades restoration, what is the status of CEPP and the EAA? I know we are still waiting for the Corps to finish the 90-day report on EAA, which is required by WRDA in 2018. Can you give us a little more detail? I know you touched on it, General Semonite. General Semonite. So, ma'am, that report will be done in May, and it is going to go to the secretary, and then he will hack off on it. I do believe he has to send it to OMB. The other thing we have got to do is the environmental impact statement. That closed on the 24th of February of this year. So now it really goes back to be able to get that new start. Now, the budget, 2021 budget, does have $148 million in it, and that is where anything we can do to be able to free that up we will certainly do it. And I am more than willing to look at different interpretations, but right now, we don't think we can get past that new start decision. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. OK. And then, lastly, is the Corps prepared to use all contracting tools available to implement CEPP? The conditional contract clause, does that apply to provide flexibility that enables the projects to move ahead as quickly as possible? My understanding is that you are authorized in the Corps to fund annual segments of a larger contract over many years. General Semonite. That is true, and we have been very aggressive in contracting over the last couple of years to really change our approach. So anything that we can do, regardless of what type of contract it is, as long as it is within the existence of the FAR, that allows us to be able to have the right tools to be able to put this stuff in the ground. The continuing contract clause, I am not aware there is any problems with that on CEP. Ms. Wasserman Schultz. OK. Good to know. Thank you, Madam Chair. I yield back. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you. Thank you very much, Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz. I would like to now turn to our ranking member for any final. Mr. Simpson. Just a final comment. You might not understand this, but Representative Newhouse and I are really good friends. I enjoy the Hanford Reach and the PNNL and what they do as much as the Idaho National Laboratory. However, we do have some differences on a couple of issues, and I just--you know, discussing the 60-, 70-year-old history of what the Idaho Department of Fish and Game did doesn't really help us cover--recover salmon today. And like he invited the Governor of Oregon to come and look at the dams, I would encourage him to come up and come with me in August and we will go look at some streams that used to have hundreds of salmon or thousands of salmon spawning in them, and if we are lucky, we might find one or two, if we are lucky. And the one thing I would say to him, everybody says we all want to recover salmon. The question is whether they are willing to do it. And we can all talk about neat things. We have been talking about this for 50 years. Everything you do on the Columbia River, everything we do on the Columbia River can be done differently if we choose to do it differently. Those dams produce 3,000 megawatts of power. You could put small modular reactors or other things in there. You could produce it differently. Everything we do, we can do differently. Salmon need one thing. They need a river. Thank you, Chairwoman. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much, Ranking Member Simpson. Thank you again. This concludes this afternoon's hearing. Again, I would like to thank our witnesses for joining us today. I ask the witnesses to please ensure for hearing record purposes that questions for our record and any supporting information requested by our subcommittee be delivered in final form to us no later than 3 weeks from the time you receive them. Members who have additional questions for the record will have until the close of business Friday to provide them to our subcommittee office. This hearing is adjourned. [Material submitted for inclusion in the record follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] [GRAPHIC(S) FORMAT] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Wednesday, March 11, 2020 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY BUDGET REQUEST FOR ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS AGENCY--ENERGY OFFICE OF SCIENCE, AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT WITNESSES HON. CHRIS FALL, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF SCIENCE HON. LANE GENATOWSKI, DIRECTOR, ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS AGENCY-- ENERGY WILLIAM (IKE) WHITE, SENIOR ADVISOR TO THE UNDER SECRETARY OF SCIENCE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT Ms. Kaptur. The subcommittee will come to order as we begin our hearing on the Department of Energy's fiscal year 2021 budget request, with respect to its environmental management, science, as well as the ARPA-E programs. Thank you to our witnesses for being here, and we apologize for some of us for being few minutes late. We just did finish a series of votes. This is our committee's fifth hearing. As I have expressed in the last four hearings, I am deeply disappointed in the administration's budget request. The deep cuts are unrealistic and will result in a failure to address our Nation's most pressing challenges, including climate change and maintaining America's leadership in energy innovation, and, surely, the Trump budget utterly fails to meet our moral and legal obligations to the communities that helped our Nation win World War II. The Department of Energy's Office of Environmental Management addresses the environmental legacy, resulting from five decades of nuclear weapons production and Government sponsored nuclear energy research. EM is responsible for the cleanup of some of the world's most radioactive sites, a mission that is complicated and dangerous, but vital to ensuring clean soil, water, and air, for many Americans now and for future generations. This unrealistic request proposes to cut EM by 19 percent, jeopardizing progress made on the remaining 16 sites, and we have some photos up there, while delaying several project, unnecessarily. These deep cuts translate into a moral and legal failure that we simply cannot accept. Similarly, the budget request proposes draconian cuts to the Office of Science, 17 percent, or $1.2 billion, from last year's level. The Office of Science is an indispensable pillar of American leadership in science and technology, yielding over 100 Nobel Prizes. Every time I say that, 100 Nobel Prizes, and making key scientific advances, ranging from creating solar energy system and successive generations of batteries, to inventing new materials and decoding DNA, we are just at the beginning of that age. Cuts of this magnitude will endanger America's leadership in technological innovation, economic progress, and, I believe, national security. Reflect, for the moment, for just this moment, on 100 Nobel Prizes. These programs embrace the future, sustain a better life for all, and assure our national security on many fronts, including the unknown. Finally, the proposed elimination of the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, ARPA-E, Program is an absolute nonstarter. Since its inception, ARPA-E has supported breakthrough technologies, such as next generation batteries, electric aviation, and improving components of solar panels. ARPA-E fills the gaps between basic and applied research, where the private sector will not take on those financial risks. Just, if you look at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the number one job in America now that remains unfilled, it would be solar installers. So, the work of ARPA-E filters down to production platform, ultimately. This is vital. This program, ARPA-E, is vital to innovation, and our Nation should be investing more in science and engineering, not less. Our country's energy future depends on the Department of Energy's vital investments to solve our toughest energy challenges. The Trump budget request harms America's energy future, our competitiveness, our workforce, our consumers, and our economy. The Trump budget also falls short in meeting our obligations to the communities that have sacrificed, and still bear the brunt of environmental costs born from winning World War II. We are in the new century. We have got to fix that. With that, I will close my remarks. Thank you, Dr. Fall, Mr. Genatowski, and Mr. White, for being here today, and, to Dr. Fall, thank you, for visiting Ohio for our National Laboratory Day. It was a rewarding and very valuable conversation, that is yielding real results. We look forward to discussing the Department's budget request and adapting it accordingly. I would like to turn to our able ranking member, Mr. Simpson, for his opening remarks. [The prepared statement of Ms. Kaptur follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT TIFF FORMAT] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Simpson. Thank you, Chairwoman Kaptur. I would like to join you in welcoming our witness to today's hearing. I believe it is the first time we will get to hear directly from all three witnesses on these programs. So, we will try to make it so that you do not want to--so that you want to come back again, yeah. I look forward to hearing about the priorities included in the fiscal year 2021 budget request, for your respective programs, namely Environmental Management, Office of Science, and ARPA-E. The Department of Energy investments in basic science research have provided great benefits to our national economy, national security, and the everyday lives of our constituents. Just a few weeks ago, we had a hearing on DOE's work with NIH and others in the biomedical sciences, a topic that seems pretty relevant these days, the Advanced Energy Research Project-Energy, or ARPA-E. Research and development projects are often described as high risk, high reward, and, therefore, something the private sector, on its own, is unlikely to pursue. By authorization, APRA-E is tasked with accelerating transformational advances in energy technologies. The Federal Government has a responsibility to clean up five decades of nuclear weapons development and production. This work is the mission of DOE's Environmental Management Program. Over the past decade, EM has made significant progress on cleaning up sites across the country, but there is still a heck of a lot of work to do. I think I can safely say that Congress will make some significant changes to this budget request for those programs, as we have in the previous years. I look forward to the discussion with the witnesses to inform our work here on this committee. Chairwoman Kaptur, again, thank you for calling this hearing, and I yield back Ms. Kaptur. Thank you, Mr. Simpson. We will now turn to our witnesses. First, we will have Lane Genatowski, the Director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, ARPA-E. Prior to joining ARPA-E, Director Genatowski served as senior advisor to the under secretary for science, and in various private sector roles in the banking and energy sectors. Next, we will have Chris Fall, the Director of the Office of Science. And prior to his position, Mr. Fall served as Senior Advisor to the Under Secretary for Energy and as acting director of ARPA-E; and he has also served in a variety of roles at the Office of Naval Research. And finally, we will hear from Ike White, Senior Advisor to the Under Secretary of Science for Environmental Management. Prior to this role, Mr. White served as Chief of Staff and Associate Principal Deputy Administrator for the National Nuclear Security Administration. At NSA, he also served as the Deputy Associate Administrator for Safety and Health, and in a variety of leadership and technical positions. Thank you, all, for taking the time to be here today. Without objection, your written statements will be entered into the record. Please feel free to summarize your remarks in about 5 minutes each. I want to thank, again, all of our committee members for being present today, and we apologize for making you wait about 10 minutes because we did have a series of votes. We would like to start with Director Genatowski. STATEMENT OF LANE GENATOWSKI Mr. Genatowski. Chairwoman Kaptur and Ranking Member Simpson and members of the committee, thank you very much for inviting me up here. It is an honor to appear. I will get right into the 2021 budget request, and then move along. The President's proposal--budget request proposes no additional appropriations for ARPA-E for new projects. It requests $21\\1/ 4\\ million for program direction regarding to existing projects and requests a cancellation of any unobligated balances estimated to be $332 million. If this budget is approved, ARPA- E will not invest in any new technologies in 2021. However, approximately 350 projects which are ongoing will be carried out to completion or their cancellation if they do not meet their grant contracts. ARPA-E started in 2009, and since then, it has achieved some remarkable things. And after following on $2.3 billion in appropriations, they got follow-on funding of $3.2 billion. That is about 150 percent of what was appropriated. So, these are indications of success that they have. Three hundred and eighty-five patents were issued and 219 projects were carried along to other Federal agencies. So, the success ratio is pretty good for what they do, where they focus on the TRL Scale. In 2019, administering the last 2 or 3 months of the budget when I got involved in July, we obligated 374 million, which was the highest obligation rate we ever had. And it is a testament to the staff, that they could execute all the contracts and get them out the door to make sure we spent all the appropriations. One program in the 2019 budget that was approved was the PERFORM Program. Renewable electric-generating assets are, actually, not dispatched as highly as they could be by the system. This program is meant to address that. So, when the renewable is available, they are given a risk score, like every other project is given a risk score under this program. And we think using statistics and AI will get the renewable assets dispatched into the generating system, into the grid, more quickly and more assuredly. In 2020, I want to thank you all very much for the $425 million appropriation that we got. So far, we have announced $287 million of FOAs, which is about 75 percent of the year's work, so we are ahead on that score, and they include several interesting programs. One is a fusion program which we are cooperating with Director of Science Fall on fusion; and another program which is called GEMINA, which directs itself to fission, and has the target of reducing O&M by 90 percent on the new small modular reactors. Finally, I would like to say that the personnel at ARPA-E are outstanding, in my experience; the consistent high quality dedication, they will go anywhere and work any hours that are required to get their projects done. One of the unique things is the program director position is filled by candidates 3 to 5 years at a time. So, it requires a constant refresher of ideas, which always is interesting to hear the debates every other week in the office among the PDs, program directors, as to what they are focused on and what they are interested in. You have asked me to put some slides together. And that is something from our ENLITENED Program, where we use photons for chips to communicate inside computers rather than wires. Photons are smaller than electrons and has a reduced heat factor and an increased speed factor. That has been a very popular--that little thing is a robot, and it goes through and identifies--it is called phenotyping. It identifies the qualities of plants, automatically, that will yield a higher crop yield in biofuels, and that is part of our REACT Program. The next one is an electric motor that does not use any rare earths, and it has a performance factor at a comparable cost to regular motors. And as you can see there, or maybe you cannot see, the team leader in that one was Baldor Corp., so starting to be commercialized from the start. The next one is--and a battery. It is a large grid-level battery for storage. It is a flow battery and it is based on iron. So, it is readily available material in the United States, which is something that we tried to focus in on. The last thing is--it is difficult to say what that is, but that is a drill bit on the left, and inside the middle of the drill bit is a laser, and it is drilling for geothermal fluid. And what it does is the laser softens the rock and the drill bit goes through. So, it is more efficient in terms of getting to the rock. Quite often, geothermal reservoirs are capped by very hard rocks. They are a high temperature, high pressure, and what this does, it makes the drill more efficient. That is the end of my prepared remarks. I would like to thank you very much for giving me the opportunity, and I am happy to answer any questions that you might have now or later. [The prepared statement of Mr. Genatowski follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT IN TIFF FORMAT] Ms. Kaptur. We will have a question period before I turn to Mr. Fall. Do you have anything to say about the portion of your testimony that deals with agricultural carbon management? You did not mention it in your verbal testimony. Mr. Genatowski. Well, no, I did not. Ms. Kaptur. It was on page 3. Mr. Genatowski. Oh, fine. Well, the little robot had to do with agricultural products in terms of growing biofuel more efficiently and phenotyping them to get better types of products. Oh, Smart Farm, I beg your pardon. My first time, I am a little nervous. Ms. Kaptur. Oh, it does not show. You know so much. I am just glad for the photos. You are making ARPA-E real for our members and for the country. Mr. Genatowski. Thanks very much. Smart Farm bioreactors process fuel and then they send it to biorefineries, and they send it to fuel refineries to be mixed in as ethanol. So, to the extent that they are told there is a certain carbon capture level in the--it is a national level. And what the Smart Farm tries to do is to make the carbon capture nature of the particular agricultural project localized to the region. So, if your region has soybeans that capture more carbon or sequester more carbon or use less carbon, we measure it in the soil. And that program has to do with, basically, quantifying the carbon, so the farmers can get paid more for what is stored in the soil, and it is place by place. Indiana or Illinois or Ohio have different levels of carbon in the soil. Now, a national level is used, and we are trying to get a specific level for a farm use, so that people get more money for it. It will be a more cash crop, and it will grow more of it. Ms. Kaptur. Well, that is a whole long conversation that we should have both before the committee and then maybe a private briefing because you are into something that struck right to my aorta, I will tell you. That is vital. I just returned from the Salton Sea, and---- Mr. Genatowski. Ah. Ms. Kaptur. Anyway, that is a long conversation, but we---- Mr. Genatowski. My first geothermal project was on the Salton Sea. Ms. Kaptur. We need you there more. Thank you very much Mr. Genatowski Mr. Genatowski. Thank you. Ms. Kaptur. Mr. Fall. STATEMENT OF CHRIS FALL Mr. Fall. Ma'am, we have some pretty exciting things in the Office of Science, and I am not sure that we have a laser drill. I think I want the laser drill. Thank you, Chairwoman Kaptur, Ranking Member Simpson, and distinguished members of the committee. It really is a privilege to be here and represent the Office of Science before you today. The fiscal year 2021 budget request for the Office of Science will ensure continued U.S. leadership in basic physical sciences, our core responsibility, and continued support for the underpinnings of our Nation's technological and economic future. We are requesting support for investments in new and ongoing administration initiatives, as well as continued support for basic research, for construction and operation of our major scientific user facilities, and to renew and modernize the critical infrastructure of the national laboratories. Just a few examples, our integrated computational and data infrastructure for scientific discovery will dramatically shorten the time it takes to do ambitious experiments, analyze the results, make computational predictions, and then flow those results back to new experiments. This is transformative, in my opinion. The Next Generation Biology Initiative will allow us to move from the genomics and biochemistry of biological systems we work on now toward the development of bioinspired, biohybrid, and biomimetic systems that will bolster biotechnology as an industry of the future. Our Separation Science Initiative will radically improve the extraction of rare earth minerals and help achieve supply chain independence for these critical materials, and the same underlying science applies to carbon capture technology. Separation science applies equally to carbon capture and to rare earth elements. We would like to revolutionize polymer upcycling by developing the technologies for moving discarded plastics up the value chain instead of down the value chain. Building on the Pilot Cancer Moonshot, we would like to accelerate data and computational collaboration with the National Institutes of Health. Our data handling, our supercomputers, and our expertise is something the NIH uses already. We would like to expand that. One of the Office of Science's most significant contributions to science, medicine, industry, and national security over the decades has been particle accelerator science and technology. The Strategic Accelerator Technology Initiative will focus on innovation and technology transfer that will build up our domestic supply chain for these critical dual-use technologies, and we are closely partnering with the National Nuclear Security Administration on that effort. And finally, and interestingly, we propose to begin the work of connecting our national laboratories with an entangled quantum network, a backbone that we believe will lay the foundation for a commercial national quantum network. Those are new initiatives we are proposing for 2021. We ask for continued support for ongoing priority initiatives, including artificial intelligence, quantum information sciences in response to your legislation, the Exascale Computing Initiative, microelectronics innovation, biosecurity, isotopes, and enhancing the domestic U.S. fusion program. I would just like briefly to call your attention to the effort we have made at the Department to better coordinate with other programs outside of the Office of Science. Secretary Brouillette stood up the Research Technology Investment Committee, or RTIC, with just this purpose, to coordinate technology work across the whole Department. The Office of Science now participates in Grand Challenge efforts such as grid scale storage and battery cycling that are just the result of the Secretary's direction to work together as one team on these priority initiatives. In closing, I just want to say again how privileged and, frankly, proud I am to represent the Office of Science before you today. The career team headquartered at Forrestal, including what I think to be the best budget officer in the Federal Government, the phenomenal scientific and engineering talent in our laboratories, and the incredible world-unique machines we built for discovery, really represent the most capable science and technology enterprise in the world. This proposed budget will allow the Department of Energy to continue to leverage our technology superpowers, science at scale, the convergence of the disciplines, and these remarkable user facilities we support to solve the great scientific questions of our time, to effectively address the great human challenges of our time, and to provide for economic opportunity and better lives for our citizens. Thank you. I welcome your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Fall follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Ms. Kaptur. Mr. Fall, what are we looking at there with that blinking light? Mr. Fall. That is the quantum loop. That is the first stage of this quantum network connecting Argonne National Laboratory. I think that is about--it is listed up there, it is 26 miles, so a 52-mile round loop. We are going to build this out, connect all of our national laboratories, this entangled quantum network, fundamentally different from the internet. And then we are hopeful, just like what happened with ARPANET, ARPA's original internet, the commercial sector will pile on top of that and use that backbone as a way to build a commercial quantum network. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much. Mr. White. STATEMENT OF WILLIAM WHITE Mr. White. Chairwoman Kaptur, Ranking Member Simpson, and members of the subcommittee, I appreciate your support for the Department of Energy's Environmental Management mission, and I want to thank you for the opportunity to be here today. Throughout the 30-year history of EM, many sites have been cleaned up and closed, transitioning from waste sites to wildlife refuges, wetland preserves, and job-creating economic development hubs. Over the past 9 months that I have been on the job, I have had the opportunity to see cleanup progress firsthand at sites like Hanford and Idaho, Oak Ridge. I know many of you have as well, since I met a couple of you in your districts at events to celebrate the progress we are making at those sites. The fiscal year 2021 budget request enables EM to continue building upon that success and enable further cleanup progress. A key focus of the request is tackling one of EM's largest challenges, tank waste. Not only does tank waste account for one of our largest environmental risks, it also accounts for 60 percent of our total environmental liability and 40 percent of our annual budget. After decades of preparation and support from this committee, EM has reached an inflexion point with Savannah River Salt Waste Processing Facility coming on line this year, and ramping up operations in fiscal year 2021. SWPF will eventually enable EM to process up to 10 million gallons per year of tank waste, and accelerate the mission at Savannah River to finish in just 10 to 15 years. The request also supports initiating operations at the Integrated Waste Treatment Unit in Idaho to enable EM to treat the remaining tank waste in Idaho in the next 5 to 10 years. Hanford also remains a top priority, representing nearly one-third of the entire request. The request focuses on completing and commissioning the facilities and infrastructure needed for the Direct-Feed Low-activity Waste System to enable initiation of tank waste treatment by the end of 2023. Collectively, these capabilities represent a fundamental shift for the program when completing long-running construction projects, to a solid commencement of tank waste treatment operations. To put the scope of what we will achieve with these new capabilities and perspectives, we have treated about 16 million gallons of tank waste to date for the program. With SWPF and IWTU and DFLAW online we will be able to process that same amount of tank waste in under 2 years. In addition to prioritizing the tank waste mission, Madam Chairwoman, the request will enable continued progress across EM, modernizing infrastructure and the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant so it can continue to play a vital role for DOE and EM for years to come. Completing the removal of targeted buried waste at Idaho, continuing slab and soil remediation at Oak Ridge East Tennessee Technology Park, continuing demolition of the first enrichment process building at Portsmouth, EM has a lot planned for fiscal year 2021, and I am confident in the ability of our talented and dedicated Federal and contractor workforce to get it done. To strengthen our ability to achieve continuing success, we are also pursuing a set of strategic initiatives. They include strengthening project management, expanding new contracting mechanisms to encourage innovation, and reduce government costs. We will also continue the science-driven and risk- informed approach to cleanup. And with the safety record that is well ahead of other comparable industries, we will continue embracing a safety- first culture. As someone who has spent most of my 30-year career focused on the safety of nuclear operations, this is particularly important to me. So, in closing, I would like to thank you and members of the committee for your support of the EM mission. I know a number of you have EM sites in your districts or at your states. As Congress works to complete a final budget, I look forward to working with you to meet the Federal Government's moral and ethical responsibility to complete the EM mission. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. I look forward to your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. White follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE TIFF FORMAT] [GRAPHIC(S) IN TIFF FORMAT] Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much, Mr. White, and all of you for your statements. As a reminder, for those members present in the room when I gaveled in at the beginning of the hearing, I will recognize you for the questions in order of seniority, alternating between majority and minority, until all who arrived prior to the gavel have asked questions. And for those who arrived after the hearing had started I will recognize those members solely in order of arrival, again alternating between majority and minority. And lastly, I intend to observe, as best we can, the 5- minute rule for questions and answers. And we will now begin questioning under our normal rules. Dr. Fall, obviously the coronavirus-19 is in the news and at the forefront, but most people probably don't realize that the Department of Energy's national labs are contributing to scientific solutions, for example. And I hold a story here I will make part of the official record from the Chicago Tribune about the Argonne National Lab. And we know that the Department of Energy's x ray light sources are used to image proteins of the virus, like those shown on the screen. And those can reveal target sites for antiviral drugs and assist in vaccine development. Could you please tell us what Department of Energy's assets are already being used, and what capabilities do DOE scientists possess in their user facilities to offer biomedical solutions and suggestions to our biomedical community with respect to the coronavirus-19? Mr. Fall. Thank you for the question, Chairwoman Kaptur. As I think you all know already, you know, generally no other agency builds x ray light sources. So we build these things, we operate them on behalf of the country, on behalf of the academic researchers, and certainly on behalf of the National Institutes of Health. Here is an example, this story in particular that you mentioned, we have a number of these light sources. They are all capable of doing this kind of work, crystal, characterization of crystals, of proteins, just taking a picture of the coronavirus, understanding how it is put together, and, in the case of a potential interventions, figuring out how to interrupt how that virus is put together inside of cells. Now that is one example. However, there is a whole computational side of that same question, so researchers are using our supercomputers to model the coronavirus, to model and predict. So here we are taking pictures and doing an experiment on the coronavirus. We can also predict using databases of-- using the structure of the coronavirus and databases of drugs, what might work, so that we can then--but I talked earlier about that interaction between computation and experiment, prediction and validation. So, both of those are happening at our DOE labs. And then the third component of this is epidemiological modeling. So, how fast could the disease spread, and what factors influence the spread of that disease? That is a big computational challenge. We are doing that as well. We can do genome. As you know we have a whole part of my organization oriented to understanding genes, genomics, sequencing, and so forth; that is another area of expertise. So, across the board, a lot of opportunity here. I can't remember if the story mentioned this particular factor, but, in fact, we were on a shutdown of the APS when the coronavirus outbreak started. We ended up using our resources to restart that facility 2 weeks early in order to get those crystals on the machine and take those pictures. So, it is a great story. Ms. Kaptur. In view of some of the apprehension of the public, and obviously our need to know how to help the public, any progress you make on that, thinking how to communicate that would be very valuable to our members. So, I just urge you, you know, to follow that closely and to let us know. Mr. Fall. Thank you, ma'am. And the labs have come together as a team. We have working group meetings several times per week on the existing work going on and future opportunities for how we can help. So that has been very well coordinated, being very well coordinated with the White House, with HHS, we are connected to all the groups working on this. So the agencies understand that we are available and organized to be a resource as needed. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you so much. Mr. Genatowski, I really appreciated your testimony, and I want to just go back, and this will be my last question for this series. We will go to the other members. But on agricultural carbon management, that topic fascinates me because I represent a region of the country where Lake Erie, the southernmost of the Great Lakes, is the drain for the largest watershed in the entire Great Lakes, and Lake Erie is sick. And the only way we can cure it is by having a very, very concerted effort in the vast watershed it drains to understand soil science and which plants, for example--we're a major soybean bowl--to plant between the soybean rows, to have a lot of plants with roots that absorb the excess legacy nitrogen and phosphorous that is in the soil, and also some other matter that is spread on the soil, be it fertilizer or manure, to prevent drainage into the lake. The land is not managed that way now, and I am wondering what in your--maybe we want to invite you out to Ohio. And I just returned from Southern California, and looked at the Salton Sea. That is a drain, too. I think the Everglades, though, our dear Congresswoman Frankel has just stepped out for a minute, if we look at what is happening there because of sugar beets. You have got Salton Sea draining the Imperial Valley, you have got Lake Erie draining the Western Basin, you have got the Everglades, you have got examples across this country where the relationship between carbon management and water health is direct. But we don't yet have through the Agricultural National Resource Science Offices over at the Department of Agriculture, we don't really have--we have a lot of well-intentioned objectives, but we really don't have the science yet for regenerative soils and those that hold carbon and reward farmers who use those practices. What enlightenment could you give us? What could your office provide to regions like this that are truly facing a frightful situation with the pollution of their water from agricultural practices? Mr. Genatowski. I beg your pardon. Our roots program is directly related to that, where we are trying to get the roots to grow deeper and keep more in the soil, carbon, keep more fertilizers so it doesn't run off. We are mostly now in a combination of the stage of measuring to reward the farmers, and the roots program is in the stage of trying to redesign and type the plants that are most successful at that. So once we get the two of those combined, I think that is something that can be rolled out and let private initiative take care of the farmers, give them more money for what they do, for what they naturally do. Use fewer fertilizers, keep it in the soil better, and reward them for capturing the carbon, so not only do they do what you want in terms of capturing carbon, but they get paid more for it. Ms. Kaptur. You have an open invitation to call my office and bring your people over. Mr. Genatowski. I will do that. Ms. Kaptur. And I will invite some of my colleagues who face similar problems in their own regions. Mr. Genatowski. I appreciate the invitation. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much. Mr. Simpson? Mr. Simpson. A correction first: it is sugarcane down there, sugar beets are good. They are grown in---- Ms. Kaptur. I am sorry. Yes, I am sorry. Mr. Simpson. Yes, sugar beets are good, remember that. I would like to yield my 5 minutes to Mr. Calvert, who has a defense hearing at 3:00. Mr. Calvert. I thank the gentleman. And Madam Chair, I am glad you were in Southern California, Salton Sea. George Brown was the first chairman of the Salton Sea Authority and then he died. And then Sonny Bono was the second and he died. And then they made me the third, and I said, I have got to get out of this job, and Mary Bono took that. And now Raul I think is the chairman of the Salton Sea. So I have a long history down there. I worked on the first power facility. I know the Congressman Veasey, going back in the early 1970s when he was Secretary of the Army. And it is not very far, Madam Chair, from my hometown. It is very famous, you might have heard of it, it is Corona, California. That is why we refer to this disease as COVID-19, not Corona. My question is, you know, I have been around a long time, and we have been talking about fusion for a long, long time, and it is always a silver bullet that is just around the corner. And, you know, I have worked with a lot of companies, and it is a silver bullet, it solves a lot of problems, if they can figure it out. And, you know, Lockheed now claims that they have an idea that I am going to go down to Skunk Works to take a look at it. They will roll off; they think there are a number of years away. I have friend over at Caltech says that is a bunch of malarkey. You know, these physicists, they all argue amongst each other, like economists. So I would like to get an understanding. Can you provide us an update on where we are at in the development of fusion, and where are we going? Mr. Fall. Well, sir, it is just around the corner. Mr. Calvert. Yes. Mr. Fall. Well, as I think you are aware, and my boss actually, Under Secretary for Science, was just out at Lockheed just last week looking at that, and I wouldn't bet against Lockheed, they have done some remarkable things at Skunk Works. But what is interesting about that is that, yes, as you know, we are funding and associated with the large fusion project in the South of France, ITER. But in the meantime, what has happened there, it is not just Lockheed. There is a whole bunch of these startup companies now, who are developing innovative technologies for fusion, and smart money, this is not federally funded, this is money that is privately raised. And so we are hopeful that we will have the flexibility while continuing to participate in ITER, and there are a lot of benefits to that, to also supporting this domestic fusion industry that is growing uniquely in this country. A little bit is going on in Canada. There is a lot of opportunity there, and the difference really is that ITER is based on--you know, got started quite a while ago, and is based on relatively legacy technology. These new startup companies are taking advantage of all the magnet technologies that have evolved, for example, superconducting magnets and so forth. That is the reason that they can do this more cheaply and in a more compact way. So, timeline, couldn't weigh on that, but it is promising. I think we understand we are going to get there. Mr. Calvert. It would solve everything if you are able to actually use fusion on a massive scale because we wouldn't have the waste product. Mr. Fall. Yes, sir. Mr. Calvert. Thank you, Madam Chairman. Mr. Fall. Save everything but your water problem. Mr. Calvert. Well, maybe we can develop--we have unendable energy, we could desalt the sea. Mr. Fall. There you go. OK. Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Ms. Kaptur. Congresswoman Kirkpatrick has kindly allowed Congressman Kilmer to precede her here. I want to thank her. Please proceed, Congressman. Mr. Kilmer. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you to my colleague. Director Fall, I mentioned to the Secretary recently that I really appreciated you coming out to my district last year to see the Marine Sciences Lab in person. The high-level attention that you and that your colleagues are giving this laboratory, including making sure DOE has an enduring presence in the community by finalizing the land acquisition this year, is really appreciated. As you know, one of the primary areas of basic research that is conducted at the Marine Sciences Lab is focused on understanding coastal ecosystem dynamics and their resilience in the face of a rapidly changing climate and a growing population that puts a greater demand on that ecosystem. A couple of questions. One, based on what you learned during your recent visit, I would love to hear from you more about the role you think the Marine Sciences Lab can play in supporting programs within the Office of Science. And then second, what support do you need from this committee, from Congress, to help you fully utilize the unique capabilities and expertise that the Marine Science Lab has? Mr. Fall. Thank you for the question, Congressman. We are thrilled to visit. Unfortunately, we couldn't do it together; I know we had talked about doing that. What we have done, as you suggested or as you said, last year was to finalize the land purchase. That was a significant investment and a heavy lift to get that on solid footing. We do have opportunities, as you suggested, the science through BER, the interface between marine and terrestrial ecosystems, a very important question, lot of opportunity there. As you know, there is a lot of advanced energy work that goes on at Sequim, and that is not funded by my office. It is funded by EERE, but the basic premise holds there. I am not a big fan as I have, I think, said publicly in single-purposed laboratories and, I think, the opportunity for Sequim is to diversify that and, yes, programs within the Office of Science, but also make that available across the agencies and, you know, clear through the policy knots that make it difficult for them to fund things going on at Sequim. So, I don't know if that is helpful. Mr. Kilmer. Very much so. And I would just offer our continued partnership as we look at fully leveraging that lab and its capabilities. Mr. Fall. Thank you, sir. And I will, you know--I am quite confident that Director Ashby at PNNL shares the vision of figuring out how we can leverage this completely unique asset in DOE. Mr. Kilmer. He does, and he has got a terrific team, some amazing people working there at Sequim. Director Genatowski, I want to start by saying I share the disappointment expressed by many of my colleagues that the administration is, once again, proposing elimination of ARPA-E. I imagine you must be equally disappointed sitting here testifying on a budget that would eliminate your role. Thankfully, Congress, I think, has shown strong bipartisan support for the growing investments in ARPA- E, in part because of the vital role it plays in basic research and development, developing next-generation renewable technologies. We have seen it in my state. These funds have supported efforts to modernize the power grid, to harness energy from new noncarbon resources, LG-based biofuels, fusion energy that will help us regain our energy independence. I guess my question for you, one, can you talk about how ARPA-E and other DOE programs are working to make sure these technologies have a pathway to commercialization? And, secondly, are there other DOE programs that support this kind of work? It seems like ARPA-E is uniquely punching above its weight on that front. Mr. Genatowski. Well, thank you for saying we are punching above our weight. What we have done is--ARPA-E had a program before I got there called Tech-to-Market, and it starts with the original proposals of all the scientists for a program that they have to have a reasonable or a colorable path to market for one of their items. We work on electric airplanes. We have got two programs that I authorized since I have been in office and on each of those programs, I waited until I was fairly well-assured that not only would the science work, but the cost per available seat mile would be lower than the revenue per available seat mile because that is the key criteria for an airline to purchase aircraft. I banked the airlines for about 5 years when I was working as a banker. So, I know that is the key metric, and I waited until they would get me that information before I let it go forward. So, that is being incorporated more and more, and expected more and more of the scientists, not to impede what they are doing, but more to guide what they are doing in a useful path so they can, I always say, get on the loading dock and get into the environment. Otherwise it is, you know, a term paper, so to speak. We are going through a reorganization now of two things. Interfacing with larger corporates with big R&D budgets to--not so much--public-private partnerships are one thing, but to educate us as to what the needs are in the marketplace. What does the market need? Not incrementally, but what does the market need in a revolutionary sense, and help to inform our researchers when they try to propose projects as to what they propose. So, that's ongoing. And I see I have 15 seconds left. Another thing we do is we have got---- Mr. Kilmer. I am in overtime, so. Mr. Genatowski. Pardon me? Mr. Kilmer. We are in the hole 50 seconds, sorry. Mr. Genatowski. I am out. Mr. Kilmer. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you, Congressman Kilmer. Congressman Simpson. Mr. Simpson. Thank you, Chairwoman. I am kind of perplexed, frankly. I was always taught that you kind of reward success and punish failure; and yet, you are all sitting here saying we are doing such a great job in ARPA-E, finding out new things, great job in sciences, we are doing such a great job in cleanup, please cut out budget. Frankly, that doesn't make any sense to me. And, in fact, it is not only in ARPA-E that we are doing such a great job finding these technological things and doing all this kind of stuff, please eliminate us. I have got to believe that it is hard for you to sit here with this budget request--and, I doubt very seriously that this committee is going to go along with the budget request. And, hopefully, I think we can have a 302(b) where we can address the deficiencies that are in this budget that are seen both by Republicans and Democrats. Let me ask you, Mr. White, at this budget level, do you think you can meet all the settlement agreements with the states? Mr. White. At this budget level, we can meet all of our near-term agreements with the settlement agreement in Idaho. We will be on track to ship to WIPP, as we have committed to do to the State of Idaho; and we are also on track to start up IWTU by the end of this calendar year. Mr. Simpson. What about settlement agreements with other states? Mr. White. In the short term, I think, we can meet all of our milestones. Certainly, deferring work in the short term makes milestones that are in outyears a little more difficult. Mr. Simpson. OK. You have recently--let me get to it. Earlier this week, the Department released a document entitled ``EM Vision 2030, A Time for Transition and Transformation.'' Are there a couple of key points you would like us to take away from this document? Mr. White. So, for me, there are a couple of key points. As you probably know, one of the things that GAO has recommended that EM do is do a better job of integrating how we look at the environmental cleanup program across the entire program and not just on a site-by-site basis. So, for me, this is an opportunity for us to lay out for the first time in recent history what the EM program looks like across the board at all of our sites. I think it is important for us to continue to make the case that we made earlier related to the progress that we have made with the investments that you have given us over the past couple of years. I think it is important for you and for the folks in the communities where we are doing cleanup and for the American people to understand that we are actually making effective use of those cleanup resources. And so, laying that out and demonstrating that is very important to me. It is also the first piece in what will be a larger effort to improve our overall integration and planning. So, it is also important to note this is a 1-year document. What it reflects is the budget that Congress has enacted in the current year, and it reflects what we see going forward for the next 10 years based on the proposal. But as we go through the 2022 planning cycle and as Congress enacts the 2021 budget, this is something that I intend to update every year to reflect both the progress that we are making with the enacted budget and what we hope to get done over the next decade. Mr. Simpson. Thank you. Director Fall, the budget request includes several crosscutting initiatives, both across program offices within the Department and across subprograms within the Office of Science. A crosscutting approach can help avoid duplication of effort while also bringing all relevant expertise to a problem, but it must be managed appropriately. How can the Office of Science ensure the effectiveness of these crosscutting initiatives? And does each initiative have specific goals and milestones, and are resources and competencies clearly aligned toward those goals and milestones? Mr. Fall. Thank you, sir. As I did mention, you know, the leadership on this really is coming from the Secretary. Actually, it was before he became Secretary, he initiated this RTIC concept for--that has led to the crosscutting department- wide programs. They are very well organized. They include ARPA- E, Office of Science, the Applied Offices, and so forth. Mr. Simpson. It won't include ARPA-E very long if we follow this budget. Mr. Fall. Potentially, sir, yes. Thank you for letting me trip myself up. But within the Office of Science--this is my own priority, you know. I come with this and I talk to my team about it all the time where I prefer them to be a chorus rather than a group of soloists, and we are working towards that. But I want to offer it is not just about the program, as I think you understand. In order to do what we do, to get money out the door to support the laboratories, to support the universities, there is a legal component, there is a contracting component. There are all sorts of bits and pieces of this machinery. And what we are doing uniquely now when we put out a funding opportunity--we just prototyped this for the first time with the Quantum Center FOA--is to bring all those people together and attack it as an integrated team, you know, all these people at once, instead of sending around the Department 10 different times. It makes common sense and you think we would be doing that. We are doing it now. So, it is not just coordinating on the programs, and the scientific objective is actually coordinating on the business processes that go into that as well. And I think that is a great success story. Mr. Simpson. Thank you. Thank you, Chairwoman. Ms. Kaptur. Certainly. Congresswoman, Kirkpatrick. Ms. Kirkpatrick. Thank you, Madam Chair. And I thank you all for being here to testify. And I especially want to thank you Director Genatowski for meeting with me yesterday discussing the innovative research that is coming out of ARPA- E, especially the groundbreaking research that you are doing with solar technology out of the University of Arizona, my alma mater. So, I do appreciate what you are doing with batteries, energy storage, new solar technology developments. So, thank you very much. Instead of this administration's continued attempts to shutdown ARPA-E entirely, I am really interested in increasing the Department's ability to fund early-stage energy research and advance U.S. energy security and economic competitiveness. How is ARPA-E coordinating with other Department of Energy offices, working with the private sector, or developing new internal programs to make sure that the technologies that have received previous support have a pathway to commercialization? Mr. Genatowski. Thank you very much for that question. We coordinate with a number of different departments and different agencies. We coordinate with Director Fall on a fusion program which we have just put out together. We work with NASA in their Ohio facility, quite a lot on electric aviation. They are going to be a testbed for our work. We are talking with them. And in point of fact, they are going to be on our Merit Review Board when proposals finally come in. In terms of the Department of Defense, we coordinate with them on many programs. So, we do have--and I said 219 programs are handed off to other offices. For example, EERE takes many of our programs and moves them the next step along the technical chain, if you will. In terms of how do I coordinate with them on commercialization? Again, we have tech-to-market professionals who have to have a first course correction when they put their proposals up, that they have a colorable title to getting to market, then a mid-course correction, and then a final report. We are always on top of them looking at what they are doing. We have what we call active management, which is different from the other programs where the program directors and their assistants visit the programs and if they have problems, they guide them, they turn them, and they try to focus them on successful science and science that will end up on the loading dock, if you will. Ms. Kirkpatrick. Can you give me a little bit of a timeline on that course correction? How long does that take to actually make that change and get it up and running? Mr. Genatowski. Well, sometimes--there was a program we had called SLIPS, which was to reduce resistance inside of a pipeline, and it morphed. It wouldn't work inside of a natural gas pipeline, but it morphed into something that now goes onto the bottom of ships. And just the application changed; some of the formulas changed. So, instead of bottom paint, they put SLIPS on and it decreases the fuel use of ocean-going transports, and that is an example of a mid-course correction. How long does it take? Some things happen more quickly. Some things we might think of as a failure and they might happen 20 years later. It is just very hard to tell. Our general commercialization rate is somewhere around 4 percent of the properties, 5 percent, which is significantly higher within the gambit that we get the information, which is the term of the grant plus 5 years after the grant. Ms. Kirkpatrick. Can you address specifically what you are doing with University of Arizona, especially regarding solar? Mr. Genatowski. Well, if you give me a moment, I could. Ms. Kirkpatrick. Sure. Mr. Genatowski. OK, thanks. Instead of eating up your time, if you will give me a moment to get back to you, that would be great. Ms. Kirkpatrick. You can get back to me. Mr. Genatowski. Thank you very much. Ms. Kirkpatrick. Thank you. You know, I went to the University of Arizona, and I live in Tucson, and so, I was just interested. But you can follow up with me after the meeting. Mr. Genatowski. Thank you very much. Ms. Kirkpatrick. Thank you very much. And thank you, Madam Chair, and I yield back. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much. Congressman Simpson. Oh, excuse me, Congressman Fleischmann. Mr. Fleischmann. Thank you, Madam Chair, Ranking Member. Gentlemen, I just want to say thank you. I have worked with each and every one of you all, and your respective agencies within the Department of Energy, and I think you are doing an exemplary job, not only for the Department, but for our country. As you know, I have the privilege of representing Oak Ridge, the Oak Ridge Reservation. I think that is rather rhetorical. Mr. Simpson. One of the best labs in the country. Mr. Fleischmann. I was going to say. And I have some very distinguished competitors on this dais, sometimes even on my side of the aisle. Now you know why I am so good to the chair. But, having said that, we are doing tremendous work. Our commitment is to work with you through this budget process, I will say that. A couple of questions. Mr. White, as you know, I am the chair of the Nuclear Cleanup Caucus. I represent a major EM site, the Oak Ridge Reservation, and I take very seriously the Federal Government's responsibility to remove nuclear, radioactive, and other hazardous waste materials from communities like Oak Ridge and other communities around the country. Our colleagues on this committee have agreed with me in the past, and have consistently funded work for the disposition of U-233 in Oak Ridge. What is the Department's commitment to dealing with U-233? What is your plan with that? And I will just let you answer that question, sir. Mr. White. Thank you, Congressman. I appreciate that opportunity to talk about our uranium-233 disposition program. I know you and I were together back in November in Oak Ridge, and I appreciate your support of the cleanup caucus. I also noted that you brought members with you from Illinois and from Nebraska to see not just the laboratory, but also our cleanup work. So, I thank you for that. With respect to our U-233 program, I think that is one of the highlights of our cleanup program. It is an isotope that we have spent decades spending money to store until we can dispose of it in a safe and effective manner. I think we have found a way, as we talked about in November, to be able to not only dispose of the material safely, but also do it in a way that saves the taxpayers money and make some of the material available for lifesaving medical research. I think that is a very important program to EM. I think that is a benefit to the country at large, and I am very much committed to that path forward for disposition. Mr. Fleischmann. Thank you, sir. Dr. Fall, as I told Secretary Brouillette a couple of weeks ago, I am very excited about the plans for the construction of a second target station at the Spallation Neutron Source, and in our last budget, I think, we actually funded the beginning research for that. It is going to enable wholly new capacities to examine the structure and dynamics of materials from polymers to proteins to catalysts, and it is also going to double the capacity of the current SNS which is oversubscribed now by a factor of 3, sir. The project is critical to maintaining U.S. leadership in neutron sciences, and I am thankful that Congress provided $37 million to complete the conceptual design in fiscal year 2020 and ready the project for CD-1 review at the start of construction. Secretary Brouillette said that he anticipated the Department making a decision about CD-1 by the end of this year or in the first quarter of next year. From your perspective, is everything on track within the Office of Science and BES to meet this timeline, sir? Mr. Fall. Well, everything is on track, sir. The time will depend, of course, on the level of appropriation. We do have quite a lot of money that has been appropriated for the SNS, and we are committed to the project, as you suggested. And relative to the gentleman's earlier question, this is a uniquely--the second target station is uniquely suited for biological work, such as with the NIH. As I understand it, the bulk of the money that we got in the last appropriation is engineering and construction money that cannot actually be used for the planning process that we are undergoing now to CD-1. So, you know, if we could get back to you on that, maybe we can work with you to shift some things around a little bit so that we can get through CD-1 and then move on to the construction of the project. Mr. Fleischmann. Thank you, sir. I really appreciate your defining that. That is very helpful, sir. Quick question, my time is running short, but on medical isotopes, Dr. Fall, we committed in this subcommittee a proposal by the Office of Science to invest in the research and production of stable isotopes, and the Department is requesting additional resources for this purpose in fiscal year 2021. Isotopes, both radio isotopes and stable isotopes for medical or industrial applications are one of the areas where DOE, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and other National Labs have had an incredible impact, including saving the lives of billions of people and having a billion-dollar impact on the U.S. economy. Dr. Fall, can you speak to what is driving the investment by the Department? And if you can provide us a status or report on the Stable Isotope Production and Research Center, and when do you expect CD-1, sir? Mr. Fall. And I apologize. I am going to have to get back to you on CD-1, exactly. But, boy, we--as you suggested, we have identified this as a priority. We are committed to it; Oak Ridge, yes; FRIB at Michigan State, and other facilities producing the isotopes. Most Americans do not understand that the isotopes that are--most Americans probably do not think about medical isotopes, but do not understand that the medical isotopes that are not commercially produced are all provided by the U.S. Department of Energy. I could also follow up with you later about some changes we are doing structurally within my office to bolster the isotope program, to carve it out and lift it up and get it more in a production mindset. Right now, it is very closely tied to research. We think that it--we think that giving that the talent that is oriented more towards production and business and sustainability is the right thing to do, in addition to these facilities, to increase the capacity of that program. Mr. Fleischmann. Thank you very much, sir. And, gentlemen, I wish you the best in your endeavors. My time is up. I yield back, Madam Chair. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you. Congressman Newhouse? Mr. Newhouse. Thank you, Madam Chair, and Mr. Ranking Member. Gentlemen, welcome to the committee. I express my thanks to you, as well, for all the great work that you and your folks do on behalf of our country. And like Mr. Simpson said, we hope that you do well enough to come back, and we would welcome you back. I wanted to talk a little bit about-- this was in my first--in the first round of questioning, a focus on the environmental cleanup efforts at the Department of Energy. Mr. White, if I could just talk to you just for a little bit here? As it was mentioned earlier, you released your Strategic Vision, I think, just this past Monday. I am aware that, for the past several years, the Government Accountability Office has been highlighting concerns about I guess what we could term a lack of a clear program-wide strategy, with better reporting, to address the growing environmental cleanup liability, and I think that is fair to say. A significant portion of that liability lies at the Hanford Reservation, as you know. First, let me commend you on heeding the GAO's input for your work on drafting this, what would be a starting point for the development of a strategic mission. Some of the document includes important priorities at the Hanford Reservation, particularly the Department's commissioning of the waste treatment plant, so that we can, finally, begin to vitrify the low-activity waste, which is very important. It is truly a high priority that we are all committed to. So, thank you for that, but there are--I got to say that there are several concerns that arise from this document or, generally, the strategy that is laid out. So, let me address those concerns, first. From what I can tell, there is--would be, essentially, no work done, conducted on the Waste Encapsulation and Storage Facility, or the WESF. And if I could recall a comment made by the Department not that long ago, but they considered the work being done there, and the pool that the capsules are stored in, to be the greatest risk in the nationwide DOE complex for serious accident. So, it concerns me that there is no work scheduled to be done, if we stick with this report. And, also, there would, essentially, be no work conducted at the 300-296 waste site, the work that is being looked at, completing the--to clean up under the 324 building. That is, certainly, a concern there. That is, literally, yards from the Columbia River, as you know. And, also, I believe, there is vital risk mitigation work that needs to go on with groundwater remediation, the dewatering of the K-Basins, building demolition. There is just a lot of things that are concerning that show up in this report. Now, I would--and I fully realize that there is constraints based upon the President's budget requests. I appreciate that, but what I want to make clear to the people at home, the people that are on the committee, the DOE officials, certainly, that my work here and the work of my colleagues and, certainly, the colleagues in the Senate, including Senator Murray, it is all to ensure one thing: that we do not allow this budget request to become a reality for the cleanup across the EM or, certainly, at the Hanford site. That just cannot be. You could walk up to almost any person on the street in the Tri-Cities and ask them a question about the Federal Government's responsibility at the Hanford. I heard the words ``ethical'' and ``moral,'' but there is one other word that would be--I think you would hear from people in the Tri-Cities, and that is the legal responsibility for the Federal Government to complete this cleanup work. And so, I just want to bring up those concerns. I wanted to let you address those. So, Mr. White, could you assure me that the Department of Energy, DOE, is still committed to the important cleanup efforts at Hanford? And then, if you could, please feel free to respond to the greater matter of the Strategic Vision and its relationship to the budget. And I know you mentioned some things about--and I do not want to put words in your mouth, but updating the report as we move forward, so. Mr. White. Thank you, Congressman. I appreciate the opportunity to talk about the important work that we do at Hanford, as well as our Strategic Vision document. A couple of things. First, on the important work that we do at Hanford. The Department remains committed to all of the cleanup work that we need to do and the environmental legacy that we have at Hanford, and that includes all of the projects that you laid out. The fact that our budget may not have been able to fit everything for the current fiscal year within the top line, and that reflects a broader set of national priorities, does not mean that we are not committed to getting it done. And we are committed to getting it done whenever funding becomes available to do that work. In terms of the Strategic Vision, it does reflect the priorities laid out in the President's budget request, but it has to be a living document because the budget process itself is a living process. And as we go forward, it needs to be updated on an annual basis to reflect not just the previous year's proposal, but also the budget that is passed by Congress and that we are enacting in the course of the current year, and I intend to do that. Mr. Newhouse. OK. I appreciate that, and I look forward to continue working with you, as well. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you for your indulgence. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much. Dr. Fall, the Department's long history and leadership in supporting basic science has resulted in biomedical innovations and applications, some of which you have referenced, all of which have enabled future breakthroughs in health research. Some of these include drug discovery, high-precision imaging to advance-precision brain and nerve mapping, cancer detection, and cancer treatment. In a recent hearing held by this subcommittee, we learned that over 90 percent of new drugs approved by the FDA between 2010 and 2016 used the Department of Energy's light sources as an essential part of their drug development. Could you, perhaps, enlighten us, if you can, on what are the most promising areas of biomedical research that might benefit from more collaboration between the Department of Energy, the National Institutes of Health, and other Federal agencies, like the VA and the DOD, and their medical arenas? Mr. Fall. Yes, ma'am, and thank you for the question because I think it is as you suggested, it is a great story of collaboration, existing work. And I do want to let you know that we took the SEAB report, Secretary of Energy Advisory Board report, on NIH-DOE collaboration very seriously and every one of my deputy program leads has now met with counterparts at the National Institutes of Health to look for additional opportunities; as you suggest, imaging, the accelerator science, and technology beam therapies is another angle, obviously, our computers. At the end of the day, what we bring that almost no other agency brings, I will just say what I said in my statement, is science at scale, our abilities to do these big things. NIH is a phenomenal resource for the country, but they are focused largely on individual investigators across the country and even at their institutes. We bring the big machines and the know-how of how to work in very large teams to do things, like the Human Genome Project, right? Ms. Kaptur. Yes. Yes. Mr. Fall. That was a partnership with the National Institutes of Health. We are, in addition to this, topic by topic, collaboration. We are in discussion with NIH leadership now about what that next moonshot should be. It might be as--it might be antimicrobial resistance, as was talked about in your hearing. It could be mapping the brain, as well. We are going to leave it to the National Institutes of Health to decide what their priority huge projects are, but we are standing by to work with them with our light sources and other factory science, if you will, with our supercomputers and our data handling, to attack the problem that, you know, they lean on. and we identify as something that is mutually--what is the next Human Genome Project is the question, in addition to the routine collaboration we are doing across these areas, including drug discovery and cancer therapies and so forth. Ms. Kaptur. I am going to say something that is in order, but probably a little bit unusual. There is not a sheriff that I meet with or, recently, because of this COVID-19, many of our county health Department directors in my part of the country, and when I say to them, OK, so, what is at the top of the list, and they say at the top of the list is mental illness, at the top of the list. And because we have moved from the '70s and '80s of having people in state institutions to deinstitutionalizing, and now our prisons have become the chief domiciliary for those who are so sick, and it has been interesting to talk to some of our colleagues. Congressman Gonzalez of Ohio is very interested in the human brain because of his experience in football, with a lot of his colleagues, and what has happened to them. There is a Brain Center at I think it is Boston University, where a lot of individuals who have died from professional football, their craniums are taken after they pass. And I was looking at what they have and I thought, boy, if you could get that on computers, and they are beginning to do cross sections of the brain and look at what has really happened for the onset of all kinds of illnesses that they do not completely understand. There is a doctor--oh, I have to remember his name. He runs the Stanley Institute, I think it is called, and he began measuring the craniums and looking at what was happening with individuals who had bipolar and illnesses that we give a name to, but we really do not understand, like schizophrenia. And I think with your supercomputing capacity and with the interest of a number of members--we have Congresswoman Annie Kuster, who heads a working group; another one, Congresswoman Grace Napolitano. We are--we know we are dealing with something we do not completely understand, but I think what you have, whether it is the ability to finally measure distances within the cranium, to take a look at the electronics of the brain, to think about the work that I have seen happening at some of the labs, where, oh, my goodness, the imaging is so granular that you can see things that others do not. I think you have something there, that might take on a set of illnesses that, by the way, cost us billions of dollars annually, simply because we do not know the answer. And perhaps aggregate data in a way that those scientists you talk about, who work on an individual basis, they are not able to pull together a lot of information in this highly gray area of medical research, so--and also, the way different medicines function, where those things register in the brain. Why do some medicines work? Why do others not work? Why do generics work in this patient, but not in that patient? Why? I would--I am not sure that we can find that out on bench research. I think we have to have something else that happens, and I think you can bring it together. So, I just urge you along those lines, just having had experience on the road in this job, and seeing what we are dealing with. Right now, half of those who are addicted with opioids are mentally ill. So, it gets all mixed into these other things that society experiences, and that is one area where we need enlightenment and where you just might have something that we have not looked at before. So, I wanted to mention that. I also wanted to ask Mr. White, as a follow-up to Mr. Simpson's question on the schedules for cleanup, could you be more specific about long-term delays you would experience if the environmental management budget were to be enacted as proposed? Mr. White. Thank you, Congresswoman, for that question. One example for--which relates to Mr. Simpson's district is the retrieval and eventual treatment and disposition of calcine waste. Our commitment is related to that, stretch out to 2035, but we could be doing research now that would enable us to make easier progress along that line and in the outyears. That sort of work would be some of the work that would have been deferred under the President's budget request. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you. Dr. Genatowski, I was very interested, you said you had something to do with what is going on in the Salton Sea. You or the Department, right? Mr. Genatowski. No, I did a long time ago. Ms. Kaptur. A long time ago? Mr. Genatowski. Right. I financed and then sold a geothermal plant in the Salton Sea. Ms. Kaptur. I saw several of them, and I was told more---- Mr. Genatowski. It was the Leathers Plant. Ms. Kaptur. OK, is it still functioning? Mr. Genatowski. I do not know. It was a long time ago. I worked on it for Burlington Northern Railroad. Ms. Kaptur. Where would I go to get a--the best scientific study one could find on the energy potential of the Salton Sea Bowl as the second lowest point in the United States? Mr. Genatowski. OK, and I do not know where you would go, but I can get back to you on that. Ms. Kaptur. All right. I would be really interested in that. There are at least three geothermal plants operating there now. I climbed one hill. They said, Congresswoman, you are standing on a volcano. I said I do not want to be there, and what is going on under the soil? Mr. Genatowski. Right. Ms. Kaptur. What is happening there? I would, personally, appreciate a briefing or if there are papers I can read. But if I ever felt like I was in an energy bowl, that I did not completely understand I know I was in it, the windspeed alone, and the angle at which the sun met the horizon, at the hillsides and so forth. I just thought what is this place? And I know it is the drainage bowl for the Imperial Valley, but I think it is something more. And I would like to know, from the energy standpoint, what could we maximize there? We were told by one person that one of the geothermal challenges that they have, and there were at least three geothermal sites that I saw, evidently, when they go down and they try to probe, the metal that they use corrodes within 6 months, maybe 5 months. And one of the elements they are bringing up is lithium. And I said, oh, how much of that? Is the lithium experiment working? I do not know. So, I would be very interested if the Department could collect information about the Salton Sea and perhaps share it. Mr. Genatowski. We would be happy to. Ms. Kaptur. All right. I thank you very much. On Portsmouth, Mr. White, I wanted to ask you, in May of last year, a possible radioactive contamination led the local community to close a school near the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant, you are very aware of that, so that the children would not be exposed to possible contamination. What are the results of the latest air quality tests, including the results from any independent tests conducted? Mr. White. So, I think you can just--Congresswoman, the--as you are aware, when we were notified of the potential concern by the school this past spring, we sent in a team of the world's best nuclear incident response personnel to sample the school, and then we had those samples analyzed by two of the best forensics laboratories in the Department of Energy. The sampling results indicated no radioactivity above background levels in the school. And we also provided those samples to the Ohio Department of Health, and their analysis of those samples was consistent with the analysis done by the Department. You--we have also continued to do air monitoring, as we would always do around our sites, and for 2019, we have detected no transuranic contaminants in that air sample effort that we have ongoing. And in terms of a third party sampling effort, we, you know, we committed to this school and the local officials that we would fund an independent third party sampling activity that worked to develop the sampling plan and the methodology with the local community is still ongoing, but I expect that to begin within the next few weeks. Ms. Kaptur. All right, thank you very much. Mr. Simpson? Mr. Simpson. Thank you, Chairwoman. If you want to see some real energy, come up to where I live, and, you know, it has a lot of geothermal because it used to be over the hotspot of Yellowstone. And Yellowstone is--obviously, a lot of geothermal there and all that type of thing. And if the caldera goes off in Yellowstone, I live--I have, like, 4 minutes to kiss my rear end goodbye. It is all right. Ms. Kaptur. Oh. Mr. Simpson. So, it is a full of energy up there, but I do want to confirm what my good friend from Washington said. This is incredible to me, when you look at the Richland operations, down 35 percent; the Office of River Protection, down 22 percent; Idaho, down 40 percent; Oak Ridge, down 42 percent; and the one really perplexing one is that the Waste Isolation Plant is down 3.4 percent, down $13.5 million. Where do we stand on the Waste Isolation Plant, and where is it going to-- and how is cutting their funding going to get them open quicker? Mr. White. So, I appreciate the opportunity to talk about that. WIPP, as you know, is a very important-- part of the cleanup complex. It is also important not just for EM, but for the broader national security and science missions the Department does. So this budget request protects and very much reflects a commitment to continue to invest not just in operations, but also in the infrastructure. This year we will begin work on the utility shaft to increase our ability to do work there at WIPP, we are also continuing work on the safety significant confinement ventilation system, that will also increase our ability to do work there. Those infrastructure upgrades should be in place in the 2022 timeframe, if it is on schedule. And I think that will set up WIPP for the decades to come for the Department. Mr. Simpson. So you think we will be back to full operations by? Mr. White. Current schedules, assuming those projects stay on line, the 2022 timeframe. Mr. Simpson. OK. Thank you. And I know you guys, all of you know that I am not upset with you. I know that you support the President's budget, and that is kind of what you have to do, and you argue for it, and you go through OMB, and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, and whatever comes out, comes out. And I hope you know that those Republicans and Democrats are a little flustered by what is being proposed here, and hopefully this won't stand in--you know, and Mr. Genatowski, I don't know whether to ask you any questions or not, because I don't know if you are going to be here in 6 months, after looking at the budget request. It says, please close us down. But I have been trying to figure out where the people that proposed this budget come from, what they are thinking in this kind of--you went through all of the neat things that are being done and research that has been by RPE, showed us some neat slides and all that kind of stuff. I guess my question would be, thinking from their point of view, or from their mind, why is private sector doing that? Would any of that have been done by the private sector had RPE not been in existence? Mr. Genatowski. Well, the statute requires that we do something that is unlikely to be done by the private sector. I think all projects I have examined, which are 330 we have going on, programs and projects, I don't think the private sector would have financed it. When I was in the finance business, I wouldn't have financed them. They have far too much risk, and the real risk is not whether or not the science is right or not, because I think the scientists kind of get it right. The real risk is what is the timeframe from getting it right on the bench in the lab to being able to put EBITDA on your income statement to your shareholders? That is the real risk. The risk is we are trying ameliorate that by bringing the institutions in that run their R&D research, large corporations that understand how to manage that, and try to inform us. We want them to say these sorts of things we just can't get to. Do you find it interesting? Can you get to it? It is really a question more of sometimes they don't work, sometimes they do work, that is R&D, but it is the time factor to money. Sometimes it will be, how long did it take the Internet to make money, 25 years? That is why I say, we get our answers from the scientists, and then they will have to report to us what they do for 5 years. But something that we may think is a commercial no success, comes back 17 to 27 years later to roll back in and be a success. We just can't tell. Mr. Simpson. That is then, that is really---- Mr. Genatowski. And that is what keeps them out. Mr. Simpson. That is really the debate we have here in Congress. there will be some people that want to get rid of RPE because they believe that, you know, the private sector ought to be in on all of this stuff, And we have that debate in Congress. I think that is the proper role of government, it is do those things that need to be done, that show potential for moving us forward in science and technology, and development in this country, that just wouldn't be done by the private sector, because of the investment that it would take, and the return on your investment would be--you know, you couldn't sell that to shareholders and stuff. And that is the important role I think that this plays, and it is just--and I will say again, it is amazing to me that what we want to do in this budget is defund or reduce funding for things that are looking into the future, and defund those that are trying to take care of the problems of the past. It is just kind of a strange budget, but we will work with you and we will get it done. And I don't think you will have to live with this budget, hopefully, because I know Chairwoman Kaptur is very interested in these programs and so am I and so is this whole Committee. So, thank you all for being here today. Mr. Genatowski. Thank you, sir. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you, Mr. Simpson. Mr. Newhouse? Mr. Newhouse. Thank you, Madam Chair. And thanks for the second round of questioning. Something on everybody's mind is we all did the corona bump when we ran into each other today. Very awkward, I am not used to that yet, and I hope I never get used to it. But that is certainly you can't get through the day without talking about this and how we deal with it. And Mr. Fall, as Director of the Office of Science for DOE, I wanted to ask you a little bit more about the role that the National Labs maybe could be playing and are playing in this whole effort to counter the COVID-D--or COVID-19, and we are not supposed to say coronavirus anymore because of Calvert. But I am aware and, in fact, I am going to be going to Richland next week, to the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory partly, not just because it is in my district, but they are doing some things that are very, I think, potentially very important for this effort. As I understand that the Environmental Molecular Science Laboratory, the EMSL, they are working on ways that they could assist in that. And I am not a scientist, so excuse me for my stumbling through, but the biomarker discovery efforts there that could be looking for signs of immune response in patients, antibodies that indicate that a patient is exposed even if they are asymptomatic, but it shows actively circulating viruses. So, just a couple of questions, and I will let you expound, because you are much more adverse to this. So is it true that current testing kits only identify whether a patient currently has an active virus versus someone who has previously been exposed? And how can these biomarkers assist with screening and testing? And then I am also aware that PNNL's imaging capabilities could assist with the development of a vaccine. So do you know that or could you speak to that potential as well? Mr. Fall. Yes, sir. I don't know about the testing kits actually. I will get back to you on that. I don't know the details of what they can actually do. Mr. Newhouse. I may learn next week, so I will be able to tell you. Mr. Fall. That is right. But what I can say is that generally speaking, the paradigm for biomarkers is looking for derivative signs, if you will, biological signs of some underlying process that are maybe more accessible. Instead of having to take blood and do a blood test, you do a saliva test or maybe a skin test or something. This is the idea behind biomarkers. And absolutely, the Environmental Molecular Sciences Lab is positioned to do that work. As I mentioned earlier to the chairwoman we, you know, have now organized this front door for the whole laboratory complex, where questions like yours were put out to this committee of representatives for all the labs. And instead of, for example, going to, you know, knocking on PNNL's door, we put it to the committee and find out actually which lab. We don't have a national biotechnology laboratory that can do this kind of thing. So, this is sort of, call it a virtual biotechnology laboratory, where we have one front door and can reach out to all of the capabilities of our laboratories. Pardon, the third question, sir, was? Mr. Newhouse. The vaccine potential. Mr. Fall. Yes. That is right. Yes. And of course, as you may know already, we have incredible capability in this country to rapidly develop candidate vaccines. PNNL could help with this or other laboratories could help with this. The trick for a vaccine is not development of it, and DARPA, in particular, has led efforts to quickly develop the--it is the clinical trials. And you can't at this point get around the idea that in order to safely roll out a vaccine to hundreds of millions or billions of people, you have got to do the clinical trials. Those take the time that Director Fauci has indicated 12 to 18 months to get the clinical trials partly done. I would expect we would have candidate vaccines very quickly through the existing programs that we already have. Mr. Newhouse. To begin those trials? Mr. Fall. That is right, exactly. Mr. Newhouse. OK. Well, thank you. And I think it is exciting that we have a lot of capability within the national lab system to be able to address something like this. So, thank you very much. Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you very much. Congressman Newhouse, you remind me, and listening to Dr. Fall's answer there, that in this area of mental illness I think a lot of the working groups that we have, and they are bipartisan, and they will appear in Congress, you are talking about dozens of members who participate in these, and it might be very helpful to you as you draw from your different scientific capabilities across the government, and try to figure out how--you know, where would you concentrate. It might be interesting for you to send somebody up here, and we will gather some of those members, and you can just listen to them, based on what they have been struggling with, what they have been attempting to achieve from the standpoint of the law, and for them to hear more about the science and what your science capabilities are. Because I really think it is quite complex and it probably involves biochemistry and supercomputing, it probably involves certain physical characteristics on occasion. I am not sure all patients would demonstrate with that. But putting together sort of the datasets that exist and are scattered all over the place, you might actually be surprised at what you are able to do. I don't think anybody in the Federal Government has done that. And, you know, we meet these different scientists that come up here, and I sort of feel like they have their hand on the tail of the dog. If you think, OK, what is next here, how do we find all the pieces and fit them together? There are certain private labs that know a lot, that make medicine. I don't know what they know and what they don't know, and they will probably use your light labs. So I view the research is scattered and you might have a powerful role to play in gathering some of that and posting it in some coherent manner. If you ever get a chance to go up to Walter Reed, there is an Intrepid center, but Walter Reed, and it specifically tries to serve veterans who had certain types of brain concussions and other onset illnesses during their military service. That is a very interesting place, and some of the light machines, various types of machines, imaging machines that they have there that I haven't seen anywhere else. Very fascinating. And so to think about the work you have done with PET scans and other things that have come out of the labs, purposefully, or by accident, and capabilities that you have, there is so much there. So, I just--I encourage you down those lines, and would welcome to invite a bipartisan group of members to just give you some of their impressions based on what they know. I would hope you would be open to that. Mr. Fall. Yes, ma'am, of course. And I might be remiss if I didn't credit prior Secretary Perry for the work, I think you are aware of, with veterans and our supercomputers and TBI, really led the way of the collaboration with the Veterans Administration on gathering these data--particular kind of dataset, brain injury, and analyzing those on our supercomputers. Ms. Kaptur. And it was the last thing I talked with him about; I think he went out to California. I can't remember if he went to Boston. I think he was scheduled to go to Boston, but didn't go. It would be a shame if we--we had another doctor here, it was Tim Murphy from Pennsylvania, and he left Congress before he completed his work. But he was dead serious about this topic. And I just think we need to pick up the threads of this somehow and have it make more sense. And you have the ability with those light machines to understand even with current medications or treatments that are out there, whether that registers in the brain or the nervous system, and why it works or why it doesn't work. So, anyway, it would be a very interesting exploration. I have a final question, Dr. Fall. Your budget request would cut the Office of Science Workforce Development by 27 percent, programs critical to bringing in new talent in your pipeline for science, technology, engineering, and math. In the next 10 years, the number of STEM jobs will grow my 13 percent compared to 9 percent for non-STEM jobs. And given the current and future demand for STEM workforce and the shortages and qualified candidates, how do you justify cutting this program? And is the Office of Science working with other programs throughout the Department to develop and expand workforce programs to ensure we have the skilled workforce that would be needed in the future, including directly in your purview? Mr. Fall. I thank you for the question, ma'am. If I could just give you a little bit of context. In fact, we are proposing to reduce the work, WDTS as we call it, the Workforce Development for Teachers and Students Program. But I need to emphasize that that is actually a relatively tiny program in the context of our budget. It is focused on some particular boutique fellowship programs that could be scaled up or scaled down according to the budget. I think it is important to understand that the vast majority of the STEM work that we do, so a couple of tens of millions for the WDTS, a few billion dollars in research expenditures, the vast majority of the students we train in STEM go through our grants program, a grant a university pays for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows and even undergraduate students in laboratories. That is actually the much more important pipeline for student development is support through our billions of dollars of grant support to our laboratories and to universities. But granted we are asking to reduce the WDTS particular program a little bit. Ms. Kaptur. All right. Well, I don't think we should cut any having to do with workforce development, so we might try to fix this. And I wanted to thank Congressman Simpson, I understand you have no further questions at this time. And Congressman Newhouse? No further questions. All right. That will conclude the hearing this afternoon. And I want to thank Misters Genatowski, Fall, and White for being with us all afternoon. I ask the witnesses to please ensure for our hearing record the questions for the record, and any supporting information requested by the subcommittee are delivered in final form to us no later than 3 weeks from the time you receive them. And members who have additional questions for the record will have until the close of business this coming Monday to provide them to the subcommittee office. Our hearing is adjourned. Thank you all.
