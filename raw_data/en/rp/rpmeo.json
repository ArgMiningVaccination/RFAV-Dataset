Response: Re: Parental Acceptance of a Mandatory Human Papillomavirus (HPV)Vaccination Program To the Editor: We appreciate the comments from Dr. Schneider1and concur with her observations about the human papillomavirus vaccines. It seems that German health care providers are confronted with many of thesame issues we face in the United States. Given therobust efcacy and excellent safety prole of these cancerprevention vaccines, we too are extremely frustrated bythe poor rates of vaccination that are documented inmany parts of the world. Furthermore, a high number ofindividuals do not complete the entire 3-dose series.There is great room for improvement to help reduce themorbidity and mortality associated with human papillo-mavirus infection. A mandatory HPV vaccination pro- gram is one means of ensuring maximum coverage andprotection. 2All health care providers should encourage their patients to receive the vaccine. Dr Schneider's com-ments about making the vaccines widely available to allinhabitants of our globe are certainly appropriate. Myresponse actually comes from our cervical cancer pre-vention clinic in Cusco, Peru (www. theincca.org, www.cervicusco.org) where we see women with cervical can-cer too often. To think that we now have a vaccine toprevent the horrid suffering associated with cervicalcancer is simply a wonderful gift to mankind. Althoughsecondary cervical cancer prevention efforts with cer-vical cytology have reduced the rates of disease, par-ticularly in developed countries, the developing worlddoes not have the capacity to derive the same benets.Yet, I believe this same gift of life-saving vaccinationwill be shared with all one day. In fact, Merck, Sharpand Dohme Corp. has been very generous in sharingtheir vaccine with the developing world. We are ex-tremely grateful to them and hope that this effort canbe expanded in the future. Daron G.

Ferris D, Horn L, Waller Parental of a man- datory Re: A Randomized, Controlled Trial of a Behavioral Intervention to Reduce Cryingamong Infants To the Editor: I applaud McRury and Zolotor1for at - tempting to add a validation study of The Happiest Baby on the Block (THB) video to the growing evidence baseevaluating this popular approach to calming babies. Unfortunately, as the authors state, their study has several critical flaws that weaken any conclusions. Therewas a small study population and a 30% drop-out rate;there was contamination by advising both the control andintervention group about the use of swaddling; a videowas used instead of a digital video disc (DVD; a moreuser-friendly interface); and parents received no instruc-tion in THB video techniques. The factor that mostundermined the reliability of this report is that there waslittle condence that the intervention was even viewed orused (mothers said they watched, but they did not refer toTHB video in their comments and did not swaddle as wasdemonstrated in the video). THB 2,3is a novel synthesis of several steps that have been shown to calm infant crying and promote sleep. It isbased on the hypothesis that babies are born with a suiteof previously overlooked neonatal reflexes (the \"calmingreflex\") that can quickly soothe most fussing during therst months of life. The goal of nding an effective approach to crying reduction is not trivial. Infant irritability, and the paren-tal exhaustion that it provokes, are primary triggers formany serious problems (eg, child abuse, failure of breast-feeding, marital stress, postpartum depression, excessivevisits to an emergency room or doctor, excessive treat-ment for acid reflux, disturbed bonding, and perhapssudden infant death syndrome/suffocation). 4 Numerous peer-reviewed studies4have conrmed the effectiveness of the interventions used in THB video (ie,swaddling, white noise, rhythmic motion, sucking). Inaddition, a growing body of pilot studies is nding ben-ets of THB video on early parent-infant interactions. In 2007, the Department of Public Health in Boulder, CO, reported a study about reducing infant crying.Home-visiting nurses taught THB techniques to 42 at-risk families (teens, drug users, etc) who had fussy babies.Each family was given a THB DVD, compact disc ofwhite noise, and a swaddling blanket. Most families (41of the 42) reported an immediate, dramatic, and continu-ing improvement in their ability to calm crying. Manyfamilies also reported more than one additional hour ofsleep. 5 Correspondence 689copyright. on 13 September 2023 by guest.
