The bacteria that causes TB infects over a quarter of the world's population, and we speak to the European scientists who are closing in on a vaccine for the disease that could save millions of lives. We also look at the rise of measles and mumps as a result of fears over the MMR vaccination - and interview researchers who are collecting information to try to prevent unnecessary future vaccine scares. Amid global vaccine rollouts, with nearly [1.2 billion](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/covid-vaccinations-tracker.html) doses currently administered, some countries have recommended a mixed-dose approach where a first prime shot is followed by a booster of a second type. The world's first mRNA vaccine has [begun its rollout](https://in.reuters.com/article/idINKBN28I01T) after being produced at unprecedented speed as part of the global effort to end the Covid-19 pandemic. A second one is hot on its heels. The two - one made by Pfizer/BioNTech and the other by Moderna - mark the first time this vaccine technology has been approved for use. Live vaccines can give health effects beyond just protecting us from a specific disease and may even help us combat other infections such as Covid-19, according to Christine Stabell Benn, a professor in global health at the University of Southern Denmark. Efforts to achieve herd immunity against Covid-19 with a vaccine could be hampered by low levels of confidence in immunisation programs in some European countries, warns Professor Heidi Larson, director of the [Vaccine Confidence Project](https://www.vaccineconfidence.org/) and an anthropologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, in the UK.
