Thank you for always supporting me in my professionalendeavors and for understanding when I locked myself in \"my cave.\" This book is also dedicated to Marydelle Polk, my mentor and friend, who shared so much with me and who had a great influence on my development as a faculty member and whom I miss dearly. Finally, this book is dedicated to the hundreds of nurses and nursing students I have taught over the years for inspiring me to actualize my passion for nursing, quality, and patient safety through writing this book.3021_FM_i-xxx 16/01/17 3:28 PM Page v3021_FM_i-xxx 16/01/17 3:28 PM \"It may seem a strange principle to enunciate as the very first requirement in a Hospital that it should do the sick no harm. It is quite necessary nevertheless to lay down such a principle.\" Florence Nightingale, 1863 Notes on Hospitals \"The world, more specifically the Hospital world, is in such a hurry, is moving so fast,that it is too easy to slide into bad habits before we are aware.\" Florence Nightingale, 1914 Florence Nightingale to Page vii3021_FM_i-xxx 16/01/17 3:28 PM Page viiiPreface In 2000, the Institute of Medicine shocked the health-care community when they reported, in their landmark report, To Err is Human, that approximately 98,000 Americans die each year as a result of preventable adverse events. In response,many patient safety and quality initiatives were launched to make health care saferin the United States and globally. More recently, James (2013) identified evidencesuggesting that a more accurate estimate of deaths from preventable errors is200,000 to 400,000 per year. There is no question that the health-care delivery systemis undergoing major changes related to safety and quality. Nurses at all levels andin all settings have been identified as key to transforming health care to a safer,higher-quality, and more effective system. Front-line nurses are being charged withtaking leadership and management roles in transforming care at the bedside. Nurseeducators must prepare a new generation of nurses to step into these roles as well as manage safe and effective patient care. To that end, this book was writtento provide a comprehensive approach to preparing nurses in the critical knowledge,skills, and attitudes in leadership and management needed for the current and future health-care environment. This book is built on the premise that all nurses are leaders and managers re- gardless of their position or setting in which they work. First-level or front-linenursing leaders and managers are those leading and managing care of a patientor groups of patients at the bedside and clients or groups in the community. Thislevel may also include charge nurses, patient care managers, and supervisors.Second-level nursing leaders and managers are those holding a formal positionin the system such as unit manager. Their responsibilities include leading andmanaging material, economic, and human resources necessary for the care of agroup of patients, as well as clients or groups in the community. The third-levelnursing leaders and managers are those holding a formal position in the organi-zation such as a director over several units and whose responsibilities are similarto those of the second level manager but encompass a broader scope. The fourthlevel or executive level includes nursing leaders and managers in positions suchas chief nursing officer (CNO) or Vice President of Nursing Services. Their re-sponsibilities include administering nursing units within the mission and goalsof the organization. Finally, many nurse leaders and managers hold positions outside direct care delivery such as nurses in academic settings, labor unions, political action groups, health-care coalitions, and consumer advocacy groups.This book provides an evidence-based approach to attaining the necessary knowl-edge, skills, and attitudes for nursing practice in today's dynamic health-care environment. It will be beneficial to prelicensure nursing students, RNs returning ix3021_FM_i-xxx 16/01/17 3:28 PM Page ixto school, new nurse leaders and managers, and nurses in any type of leadership and management position that impacts health care and health-care recipients. The underpinnings of this book are evidence-based practice, safety, quality, and effective nursing care. The book will assist students to understand a current per-spective of nursing leadership and management theories, concepts, and principles.Evidence-based content is presented on topics relevant in today's ever-changinghealth-care environment, such as contemporary leadership and management theories, managing ethical and legal issues, leading and managing effectively in aculture of safety, improving and managing quality care, building and managing a sustainable workforce, leading change and managing conflict, creating and sustaining a healthy work environment, and managing resources. The safety and quality of care depend greatly on our future nurses. I believe this book will help future nurses to attain leadership and management knowledge, skills,and attitudes critically needed to lead, manage, and provide safe, high-quality, andeffective nursing care.

notion that all nurses at all levels and in all health-care set- tings are leaders and managers. The purpose of this book is to provide an evidence-based approach to nursing leadership and management as well as practicalapplications to real-life situations that reflect today's dynamic health-care environ-ment. By integrating content from the National Council of Boards of Nursing Licensure Examination (NCLEX) blueprint, the American Association of Collegesof Nurses (AACN) Baccalaureate Essentials, the American Association of Nurses(ANA) foundational documents for nursing practice, Quality and Safety Educationfor Nurses (QSEN), the American Organization of Nurse Educators (AONE) stan-dards, and various quality and safety initiatives, students will be introduced toleadership and management theories, concepts, and principles. This book offers a comprehensive approach to prepare nursing students in the knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed to provide safe, quality, and effective nurs-ing care. It is divided into four parts that organize evidence-based information andrelevant topics for effective nursing leadership and management at various levelsand settings. Part I: Foundations and Background provides foundational information about health-care safety and quality, ethics and legal aspects, and nursing lead-ership and management. Students are introduced to historical perspectives ofthe quality and safety movement and the core competencies for safe, quality, andeffective nursing care. Health-care policy and the health-care environment areaddressed, and theories of nursing leadership and management are presented.Next, an overview of critical thinking and decision making is presented alongwith various tools that effective nurse leaders and managers can use for decisionmaking at various levels in the health-care system. Finally, effective communi-cation is reviewed, and types of communication in a health-care environmentare discussed. Part II: Promotion of Patient Safety and Quality Care focuses on patient safety and quality and includes models and tools for quality improvement, how informatics contributes to patient safety, and an overview of health-care organizations. Part III: Leadership and Management Functions presents specific roles and functions that effective nurse leaders and managers must understand and developto be able to create, manage, and sustain a healthy work environment that fostersa workforce that delivers safe, quality, and effective nursing care. xxix3021_FM_i-xxx 16/01/17 3:28 PM Page xxixPart IV: Managing Your Future in Nursing provides guidelines for new nurses transitioning to practice and guidelines for career planning and development. Each chapter in this book provides learning activities and evidence that reflect current nursing research. This book is an excellent resource for nursing students, new nurses, new nursing managers, and nurses in leadership and management atany stage of their career.xxx Introduction 3021_FM_i-xxx 16/01/17 3:28 PM Page xxxPart I Foundations and Background Chapter 1 Core Competencies for Safe and Quality Nursing Care Chapter 2 Health-Care Environment and Policy Chapter 3 Theories and Principles of Nursing Leadership and Management Chapter 4 Ethical and Legal Aspects Chapter 5 Critical Thinking and Decision Making Chapter 6 Effective Communication 13021_Ch01_001-026 14/01/17 3:48 PM Page 12Chapter1 Core Competencies for Safe and Quality Nursing Care Elizabeth J. Murray, PhD, RN, CNE KEY TERMS Advocacy scienceLEARNING OBJECTIVES Describe the impact of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) reports on the qual- ity of health care in the United States. Define the IOM competencies, outline the IOM's six aims for health care,and analyze the IOM's 10 rules for health care in the 21st century. Compare and contrast the IOM competencies and the Quality and SafetyEducation for Nurses (QSEN) Core competencies. Identify and describe fundamental elements for each core competency fornursing. Discuss the importance of effective nursing leadership and management inproviding safe and quality patient-centered care.3021_Ch01_001-026 14/01/17 3:48 PM Page 2Chapter 1 Core Competencies for Safe and Quality Nursing Care 3 Nurses at all levels are leaders in the patient safety movement. Every nurse must be educated to deliver patient-centered care as a member of an interprofes- sional team, emphasizing evidence-based practice, quality improvement ap- proaches, safety (Cronenwett et al., 2007; Greiner & Knebel, 2003).The modern patient safety movement began in 2000 when the Institute of Medicine(IOM) published its landmark report, To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System (Kohn, Corrigan, & Donaldson, 2000). With that publication, a quest for quality andsafety in health care was launched that continues today. In 2003, the IOM publishedHealth Professions Education: A Bridge to Quality (Greiner & Knebel, 2003), which identified five core competencies for all health-care professions. In response to theIOM report, the Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN) initiative waslaunched in 2005 with the primary goal of establishing a set of core competenciesspecific to the nursing profession. This chapter provides a foundation for the entire book and discusses the core competencies for health-care professionals identified by the IOM and adapted bythe QSEN faculty for nursing to be integrated into basic nursing education. Because the QSEN core competencies are now being translated into practice, thefundamental elements of each competency are discussed to help nurse leadersand managers operationalize them in their work settings. INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE REPORTS Established in 1970 as the health arm of the National Academies, the IOM is an independent nonprofit organization that works outside the federal government toprovide unbiased and authoritative advice on health and health care to decisionmakers and the public. The IOM brings together experts and stakeholders to pro-vide the nation with unbiased, evidence-based guidance on health-related issues.Since 2000, the IOM has published a number of reports related to the state of qualityin the U.S. health-care system. Box 1-1 provides a list of the reports most relevantto the content of this book; select elements of the various reports are discussed hereas well as in other chapters. The IOM's first report, To Err Is Human, was groundbreaking in that it identified medical errors as the leading cause of injury and unexpected death in health-caresettings in the United States. The purpose of the report was to present a strategy toimprove health-care quality over the following 10 years. Contending that prevent-able adverse events result in up to 98,000 deaths annually, the IOM identified threedomains of quality: patient safety, practice consistent with current medical knowl-edge, and meeting customer-specific values and expectations. Additionally, the Safety Safety cultureSelf-managementStandardized practiceStandardized protocolsStructure or care environmentTeamwork and collaboration3021_Ch01_001-026 14/01/17 3:48 PM Page 3IOM determined that patient safety is a critical component of quality. The IOM out- lined the following four-tiered approach to quality improvement (Kohn, Corrigan,& Donaldson, 2000): 1.\"Establishing a national focus to create leadership, research, tools, and protocols to enhance the knowledge base about safety\" (p. 3) 2.\"Identifying and learning from errors by developing a nationwide publicmandatory reporting system and by encouraging health care organizations andpractitioners to develop and participate in voluntary reporting systems\" (p. 3) 3.\"Raising performance standards and expectations for improvements in safetythrough the actions of oversight organizations, professional groups, and grouppurchasers of health care\" (p. 4) 4.\"Implementing safety systems in health care organizations to ensure safe prac-tices at the delivery level\" (p. 4) Before the publication of To Err Is Human, in 1997, President Bill Clinton ap- pointed the Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry to advise him on changes occurring in the health-care systemand to make recommendations on how to promote and ensure health-care qualityas well as protect consumers and professionals in the health-care system. In re-sponse, the Commission drafted a consumer bill of rights, adopting the followingeight areas of consumer rights and responsibilities (Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry, 1997): 1.Information disclosure 2.Choice of providers and plans 3.Choice of health-care providers that is sufficient to ensure access to appropriate high-quality care 4.Access to emergency services4 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND BOX 1-1BOX 1-1 Institute of Medicine ReportsInstitute of Medicine Reports 1990 Medicare: A Strategy for Quality Assurance: Executive Summary, Volume 1 2000 To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System 2001 Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century 2002 Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care2003 Health Professions Education: A Bridge to Quality Priority Areas for National Action: Transforming Health Care Quality 2004 Keeping Patients Safe: Transforming the Work Environment of Nurses Patient Safety: Achieving a New Standard for Care Health Literacy: A Prescription to End Confusion 2011 The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health3021_Ch01_001-026 14/01/17 3:48 PM Page 45.Participation in treatment decisions 6.Respect and nondiscrimination; confidentiality of health information 7.Complaints and appeals 8.Consumer responsibilities Endorsing the eight recommendations for consumer rights and responsibilities adopted by the Commission, the IOM (2001) challenged all health-care organiza- tions and professionals to work continually to reduce the burden of illness, injury,and disability of the people of the United States. Although health-care professionalswere\u2014and continue to be\u2014dedicated to providing quality care, a gap remained.Asserting that the U.S. health-care system was in need of major restructuring, theIOM called for an overhaul by outlining six aims for health-care improvement inthe 21st century in its 2001 report, Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health Systemfor the 21st Century: that health care should be safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable. The IOM believed that addressing these perform-ance characteristics would lead to narrowing the quality gap. Table 1-1 lists the descriptions of these six aims. In addition to the six aims, the IOM (2001) identified 10 rules to redesign and improve health-care delivery in the 21st century. Emphasizing that part of thequality gap reflects a lack of support of well-designed systems and the absenceof an environment that fosters innovation and excellence, the IOM contendedthat these 10 specific rules are necessary to achieve significant improvement inquality (IOM, 2001). These rules were implemented to have an impact on thehealth-care workforce and, in turn, require change in accountabilities, standardsof care, and relationships between patients and health-care professionals (IOM,2001). Box 1-2 compares the historical approach with the 10 rules for health carein the 21st century. Building on the six aims for health-care improvement and the rules for health care in the 21st century, the IOM recognized health professions education as the primary tactic to narrow the quality gap. Thus, its report Health ProfessionsChapter 1 Core Competencies for Safe and Quality Nursing Care 5 Health Care Should Be: Description Safe Avoiding injuries to patients from the care that is intended to help them Effective Providing services based on scientific knowledge to all who could benefit and refraining from providing services to those not likely to benefit; avoiding overuse, underuse, and misuse of care Patient-centered Providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patients' preferences, needs, and values, and ensuring that patients' values guide all decisions Timely Reducing waits and sometimes harmful delays for both those who receive and those who give care Efficient Avoiding waste, in particular of equipment, supplies, ideas, and energyEquitable Providing care that does not vary in quality because of personal characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, geographic location, and socioeconomic status Table 1-1 Institute of Medicine's Six Aims for Health Care in the 21st Century Adapted from IOM, 2001, pp. 39-40.3021_Ch01_001-026 14/01/17 3:48 PM Page 5Education: A Bridge to Quality (Greiner & Knebel, 2003) outlined five essential competencies necessary for all future graduates of health professions education programs, regardless of discipline (pp. 45-46): 1.Provide quality improvement. 5.Use informatics.The competencies are interrelated and applied together. However, the IOM stresses that skills related to the competencies are not discipline-specific and that each profession may put them into practice differently (Greiner & Knebel, 2003).In response, the QSEN faculty adapted the IOM competencies for the nursing pro-fession and identified the knowledge, skills, and attitudes for each competencythat should be developed in prelicensure nursing education (Cronenwett et al.,2007).6 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND BOX 1-2BOX 1-2 Ten Rules for Health-care Delivery in the 21st CenturyTen Rules for Health-care Delivery in the 21st Century 1.Care is based on a continuous healing relationship, rather than periodic individual face-to-face visits. 2.Care is based on patients' values and needs, rather than variations of care provided by health-care pro- fessionals based on different local and individual styles of practice and/or training. 3.The patient is the source of control over care, rather than health-care professionals. 4.Knowledge is shared, and information flowsfreely, rather than requiring the patient to obtain permission.

Apply the 10 rules for health care in the 21st century listed in Box 1-2 to various aspects of your experience. Can you identify examples of carethat reflect the historical approach? Can you identify examples of care that reflect the 21st-century approach?3021_Ch01_001-026 14/01/17 3:48 PM Page 6QUALITY AND SAFETY EDUCATION FOR NURSES CORE COMPETENCIES Although all health-care professionals have an obligation to provide safe and qual- ity care, nurses have been directly linked to ensuring patient safety and qualitycare outcomes (Page, 2004). The national QSEN initiative has been funded by theRobert Wood Johnson Foundation since 2005 and was organized with the purposeof adapting the IOM competencies for nursing specifically to serve as guides forcurricular development in formal nursing education, transitions to practice, andcontinuing education programs (Cronenwett et al., 2007, p.124). In addition, thecompetencies provide a framework for regulatory bodies that set standards for licensure, certification, and accreditation of nursing education programs (Cronen-wett et al., 2007, p. 124). In collaboration with a national advisory board, QSENfaculty adapted the five competencies outlined in Health Professions Education: ABridge to Quality (Greiner & Knebel, 2003)\u2014provide patient-centered care, in interdisciplinary teams, employ evidence-based practice, apply quality improve-ment, use informatics\u2014and added a sixth competency, safety. The overall goal forthe QSEN project is to prepare future nurses with the knowledge, skills, and atti-tudes necessary to continuously improve the quality and safety of the health-caresystems within which they work (Cronenwett et al., 2007). Definitions of the corenursing competencies and comparisons with the IOM competencies follow. Patient-Centered Care Patient-centered care is more than a one-size-fits-all approach to care (Frampton &Guastello, 2010). Health-care professionals must shift from disease-focused pater-nalistic care to ensuring that the patient is the source of control and facilitatingshared decision making (Greiner & Knebel, 2003). The IOM defines patient-centered care as follows: \"identify, respect, and care about patients rather than differences, values, preferences, and expressed needs; relieve pain and suffering; coordinatecontinuous care; listen to, clearly inform, communicate with, and educate patients;share decision making and management; and continuously advocate disease prevention, wellness, and promotion of healthy lifestyles, including a focus on population health\" (Greiner & Knebel, 2003, p. 45). The skills related to this competency identified by the IOM include the following (Greiner & Knebel, 2003, pp. 52-53): Share power and responsibility with patients and caregivers. Communicate with patients in a shared and fully open manner. Take into account patients' individuality, emotional needs, values, and life issues. Implement strategies for reaching those who do not present for care on their own,including care strategies that support the broader community. Enhance prevention and health promotion. The nurse-patient relationship has changed over the years. Nurses no longer make all the decisions or provide total care for patients. Instead, patients and theirfamilies enter into a full partnership with nurses and other health-care professionals.Today, active involvement of patients and their families in the plan of care and Chapter 1 Core Competencies for Safe and Quality Nursing Care 7 3021_Ch01_001-026 14/01/17 3:48 PM Page 7decision making is considered a precursor to safe, effective, and quality care. Patient safety and quality care require recognizing the patient as the source of control. Careis customized based on patients' values, needs, and preferences. The nursing corecompetency of patient-centered care is defined as the recognition of \"the patient ordesignee as the source of control and full partner in providing compassionate andcoordinated care based on respect for patients' preferences, values, and needs\"(Cronenwett et al., 2007, p. 123). Nurses develop healing relationships with patientsand families in which they share information and communication flows freely. The fundamental elements of the patient-centered care core competency includeadvocacy, empowerment, self-management, cultural competence, health literacy,and an optimal healing environment. Advocacy Advocacy is one of the philosophical underpinnings of nursing and encompassescaring, respect for an individual person's autonomy, and empowerment. Advocacy in nursing is defined as \"a process of analyzing, counseling, and responding topatients' care and self-determination preferences\" (Vaartio-Rajalin & Leino-Kilpi,2011, p. 526). Nurses have an ethical obligation to advocate for patients. TheAmerican Nurses Association (ANA) Code of Ethics for Nurses With Interpretive Statements asserts, \"the nurse promotes, advocates for, and strives to protect the health, safety, and rights of the patient\" (2015a, p. 9). Nurses often find themselvesrepresenting and/or speaking for patients who cannot speak for themselves. Thenurse's role as advocate is discussed further in Chapter 4. Empowerment As part of patient-centered care, nurses are called to empower patients and theirfamilies to engage in self-care, decision making, and developing a plan of care. Empowerment is defined as \"patients' perceptions of access to information, support, resources, and opportunities to learn and grow that enable them to optimize theirhealth and gain a sense of meaningfulness, self-determination, competency, andimpact on their lives\" (Spence Laschinger, Gilbert, Smith, & Leslie, 2010, p. 5). Asense of empowerment is vital from the nurse's perception as well as the patient'sperception. To empower patients, nurses must believe that they have the power toaccomplish work in a meaningful way. Spence Laschinger and colleagues (2010)contend that empowered nurses empower their patients, with the result being better health-care outcomes. Self-Management Self-management is a priority area identified by the IOM as needed for qualityhealth care and in achieving patient-centered care. The major aim of self-management is \"to ensure that the sharing of knowledge between clinicians and patients and their families is maximized, that the patient is recognized as the source of con-trol, and that the tools and system supports that make self-management tenable is8 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch01_001-026 14/01/17 3:48 PM Page 8available\" (Adams & Corrigan, 2003, p. 52). Further, there is strong evidence that support for self-management is critical to the success of chronic illness programs.Nurses assist patients with self-management by helping them increase skills andconfidence in managing their health problems. Health literacy, discussed next, playsa key role in self-management. Health Literacy A major barrier to patient-centered care is \"the ability to read, understand, and acton healthcare information\" or health literacy (Adams & Corrigan, 2003, p. 52). Anestimated 90 million Americans have difficulty understanding health information(Finkelman & Kenner, 2016). Poor health literacy affects Americans of all socialclasses and ethnic groups (Adams & Corrigan, 2003). The IOM defines health literacy as \"the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic information and services needed to make appropriate decisionsregarding their health (Nielsen-Bohlman, Panzer, & Kindig, 2004, p. 2). Low literacyskills are most prevalent among the elderly and the low-income population. Unfortunately, those people most in need of health care are the least able to readand understand information for self-management (Adams & Corrigan, 2003). Advocating for patients and their families experiencing health literacy problemscan make a major difference in their health-care encounters.Chapter 1 Core Competencies for Safe and Quality Nursing Care 9 LEARNING ACTIVITY 1-2Assessing Health Literacy Health literacy should be part of the health assessment performed by nurses as they begin their shift. Is health literacy part of the health assessment document in use in your clinical facility? Cultural Competence Patient-centered care requires nurses to provide acceptable cultural care and to re- spect the differences in patients' values, preferences, and expressed needs (AmericanAssociation of Colleges of Nursing [AACN], 2008a). Cultural competence is defined as \"the attitude, knowledge, and skills necessary for providing quality care to diversepopulations\" (AACN, 2008a, p. 1). Nurses have a moral mandate to provide cultur-ally competent care to all, regardless of gender, age, race, ethnicity, or economic status. Moreover, nurses must provide effective care across diverse population groupscongruent with the tenants of social justice and human rights (AACN, 2008b). Part of cultural competence consists of understanding and respecting diversity. Not everyone is alike, and nurses must acknowledge and be sensitive to differencesin patients and coworkers. Diversity is the \"range of human variation, including age, race, gender, disability, ethnicity, nationality, religious and spiritual beliefs, sexualorientation, political beliefs, economic status, native language, and geographicalbackground\" (AACN, 2008b, p. 37). Diversity is more than having different 3021_Ch01_001-026 14/01/17 3:48 PM Page 9religious views, cultural beliefs, and ethnic backgrounds; diversity can also include generational and gender differences. Disparity is another issue related to cultural competence and encompasses un- equal delivery of care, access to care, and/or outcomes of care based on ethnicity,geography, or gender. Disparity is defined as \"racial or ethnic differences in the quality of healthcare that are not due to access-related factors or clinical needs, preferences,and appropriateness of intervention\" (Smedley, Stith, & Nelson, 2002, pp. 3-4). OPTIMAL HEALING ENVIRONMENT In her book, Notes on Nursing: What It Is and What It Is Not , Florence Nightingale (1860; republished 1969) emphasizes the importance of the environment in what she callsthe \"reparative process.\" She describes nursing as more than \"the administration ofmedicines and the application of poultices\" (p. 8) and suggests that nurses shouldalso focus on \"proper use of fresh air, light, warmth, cleanliness, quiet, and the properselection and administration of diet\" (p. 8). Nightingale also recognized that thereare times when nurses cannot control the environment in which they deliver care.She notes that \"bad sanitary, bad architectural, and bad administrative arrangementsoften make it impossible to nurse\" (p. 8). In essence, what she was describing washow to create an optimal healing environment. Who knew that more than 150 yearslater, the basic principles identified by Nightingale would re-emerge as critical in thehealing process and to establishing an environment essential to patient-centered care?Florence Nightingale was clearly a nurse ahead of her time. An optimal healing environment is an environment that \"supports and stimulates patient healing by addressing the social, psychological, physical, spiritual, andbehavioral components of healthcare and enabling the body's capacity to heal itself\" (Samueli Institute, 2014, para. 2). Patient-centered care must be deliveredin an environment that fosters healing; is safe and clean; guards patients' privacy;engages all the human senses with color, texture, artwork, music, aromatherapy,views of nature, and comfortable lighting; and considers the experience of thebody, mind, and spirit of all who use the facility (Frampton et al., 2008, p. 170).Space is provided for loved ones to congregate and for peaceful contemplation,meditation, or prayer. \"At the heart of the environment of care, however, are thehuman interactions that occur within the physical structure to calm, comfort andsupport those who inhabit it. Together the design, aesthetics, and these interac-tions can transform an institutional, impersonal, and alien setting into one thatis truly healing\" (Frampton et al., 2008, p. 170). Teamwork and Collaboration Nurses and other health-care professionals cannot work in a silo. Working in in-terdisciplinary teams requires a shift in the health-care culture from one of individ-ual experts to a cooperative and collaborative team environment. Team membersintegrate expertise and optimize care for patients. The IOM defines work in interdisciplinary teams as follows: \"cooperate, collaborate, communicate, and inte- grate care in teams to ensure that care is continuous and reliable\" (Greiner & Knebel,10 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch01_001-026 14/01/17 3:48 PM Page 102003, p. 45). Although often used interchangeably, the terms interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, and interprofessional do not mean the same thing. Multidisciplinary describes a team in which members function independently and then share infor- mation with each other (McCallin, 2001). Nurses are very accustomed to workingwith and within multidisciplinary teams. However, the IOM is calling for individ-ual team members to be more involved with collaboration, coordination, and contribution to the team goals\u2014in other words, not just sharing with team mem-bers. Currently, the term interprofessional is gaining popularity because it is more inclusive of all members of the health-care team. Interprofessional refers to members with specific disciplinary training and diverse perspectives working collaborativelyin planning and implementing patient-centered care (Interprofessional EducationCollaborative Expert Panel, 2011). The skills related to this competency identified by the IOM include the following (Greiner & Knebel, 2003, p. 56): Learn about other team members' expertise, background, knowledge, and values. Learn individual roles and processes required to work collaboratively. Demonstrate basic group skills, including communication, negotiation, delega-tion, time management, and assessment of group dynamics. Ensure that accurate and timely information reaches those who need it at the appropriate time. Customize care and manage smooth transitions across settings and over time,even when the team members are in entirely different physical locations. Coordinate and integrate care processes to ensure excellence, continuity, and reliability of the care provided. Resolve conflicts with other members of the team. Communicate with other members of the team in a shared language, even whenthe members are in entirely different physical locations. With the increasing complexity of care today necessary to keep pace with the dynamic needs of patients, interprofessional teams are critical. In the truest form,teamwork focuses on patient-centered care, transcends individual and discipline-specific needs, and generates a positive synergy that results in an advanced levelof performance that would not have been possible if team members worked alone.Interdisciplinary or interprofessional teamwork results in enhanced quality of care,improved patient outcomes, and maximized resources (Galt & Paschal, 2011). Although health-care professionals may approach collaboration from different world views, certain characteristics are shared, such as coordination, communi-cation, and teamwork (Disch, 2012). Safe and quality care requires teamwork andcollaboration among all team members as well as the patient and family. The def-inition of the nursing core competency of teamwork and collaboration is to \"function effectively within nursing and inter-professional teams, fostering open communi-cation, mutual respect, and shared decision-making to achieve quality patientcare\" (Cronenwett et al., 2007, p. 125). Teamwork and collaboration are discussedin more depth in Chapter 15; however, it is important to address them briefly hereas they relate to the core competencies.Chapter 1 Core Competencies for Safe and Quality Nursing Care 11 3021_Ch01_001-026 14/01/17 3:48 PM Page 11Delivering patient-centered care requires health-care professionals to become excellent team players (Interprofessional Education Collaborative Expert Panel, 2011). Teamwork involves integrating the knowledge, expertise, and experience ofhealth-care professionals to perform collaboratively in planning and delivering patient-centered care that is safe, timely, efficient, effective, and equitable (Interpro-fessional Education Collaborative Expert Panel, 2011). Functioning as an effectiveteam member requires nurses to collaborate with other team members, patients, andfamilies, by using available evidence to inform shared decision making and problemsolving. Professional nursing's scope of practice is dynamic, often overlapping thepractice of other health-care professionals, and requires cooperation and sharing ofknowledge and ideas to deliver safe, quality care (ANA, 2010a). In addition, nursescollaborate with patients and families to assess, plan, implement, and evaluate safeand quality care (ANA, 2010a). Nurses are called to actively promote collaborativecare planning to ensure availability and accessibility of quality health care to all persons who need it (ANA, 2015a). The fundamental elements of teamwork andcollaboration include care coordination and communication. Care Coordination Nurse leaders and managers as well as all nurses coordinate care delivery as mem-bers of interprofessional and intraprofessional teams. Care coordination is a priorityarea needed for health-care quality improvement (Adams & Corrigan, 2003). Various organizations such as the National Quality Forum (NQF), the Agency forHealthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), and the ANA are embracing its appli-cation to various patient care settings. The major goal of care coordination is \"to establish and support a continuous healing relationship, enabled by an integratedclinical environment and characterized by the proactive delivery of evidence-basedcare and follow-up\" (Adams & Corrigan, 2003, p. 49). The NQF (2006) defines carecoordination as a \"function that helps ensure that the patient's needs and prefer-ences for health services and information sharing across people, functions, and sitesare met over time\" (p. 1). The AHRQ describes it as \"the deliberate organization ofpatient care activities between two or more participants (including the patient) involved in a patient's care to facilitate the appropriate delivery of health-care services. Organizing care involves the marshalling of personnel and other resourcesneeded to carry out all required patient care activities, and is often managed by theexchange of information among participants responsible for different aspects ofcare\" (McDonald et al., 2007, p. 41). The ANA identifies patient-centered care coordination as part of the independent scope of practice and a core professional standard and competency for all registerednurses (ANA, 2014). The ANA (2012) describes care coordination as \"ensuring thata patient's needs and preferences for health services and information are commu-nicated and delivered effectively among healthcare providers, functions, and settings over time\" (p. 16). More specifically, care coordination includes organizingthe components of the plan of care, coordinating the implementation of the plan ofcare, advocating for the delivery of dignified and holistic care, and documenting the coordination of care (ANA, 2015b). The ANA's (2015a) Code of Ethics for Nurses With Interpretive Statements establishes a primary commitment to the patient and12 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch01_001-026 14/01/17 3:48 PM Page 12the family and requires nurses to ensure the plan of care reflects the patient's wishes and individuality. In addition, nurse leaders and managers should work to ensurethat the relevant parties are involved and have a voice in decision making aboutpatient care issues (ANA, 2015a). Communication Communication is a key aspect of teamwork and collaboration. It involves communi- cating with patients, families, and other health-care professionals by using effectivetechniques and tools. Communication, whether verbal or nonverbal, should be sensitive, responsive, understandable (i.e., avoiding discipline-specific jargon), and,most importantly, effective (Interprofessional Education Collaborative ExpertPanel, 2011). Effective communication is accurate and timely and enhances qualityof care. Additionally, effective communication requires listening actively, encour-aging input from others, and respecting opinions of all team members. Chapter 6explores communication more in depth. There is a critical link between effective communication and patient safety. All aspects of patient care hinge on how health-care professionals, patients, and fam-ilies interpret available information (Schuster & Nykolyn, 2010). Interprofessionaland intraprofessional (made up of all nurses) team members make health-caredecisions based on information communicated among all team members withinput from patients and their families. Miscommunication and gaps in commu-nication can jeopardize patient safety. The Joint Commission (TJC, 2015) citescommunication errors as a leading cause of medical errors. Nurses need to createan atmosphere in which patients and their families feel valued, like an importantpart of the health-care team, and comfortable sharing personal information(Schuster & Nykolyn, 2010). Evidence-Based Practice Evidence-based practice promotes best practices, clinical expertise, patients' values,and patients' circumstances in health-care decisions and avoids underuse, misuse,and overuse of care (Greiner & Knebel, 2003). The IOM defines evidence-based practice as \"integrat[ing] best research with clinical expertise and patient values for optimumcare, and participat[ing] in learning and research activities to the extent feasible\"(pp. 45-46). The skills related to this competency identified by the IOM include the following (Greiner & Knebel, 2003, pp. 57-58): Know where and how to find the best possible sources of evidence. Formulate clear clinical questions. Search for the relevant answers to those questions from the best possible sourcesof evidence, including those that evaluate or appraise the evidence for its validityand usefulness with respect to a particular patient or population. Determine when and how to integrate these new findings into practice. Patient safety and quality care require the use of evidence-based practice to guide nursing practice and reduce variations in care. With that in mind, the nursingChapter 1 Core Competencies for Safe and Quality Nursing Care 13 3021_Ch01_001-026 14/01/17 3:48 PM Page 13core competency of evidence-based practice is defined as \"integrating best current evidence with clinical expertise and patient/family preferences and values for de-livery of optimal healthcare\" (Cronenwett al., 2007, p. 126). Evidence-based prac-tice also integrates methodologically sound evidence from nursing research, clinicalexpertise, and patients' preferences to facilitate clinical decision making (DiCenso,Guyatt, & Ciliska, 2005). Nurses should use evidence-based clinical decision mak-ing to individualize nursing care based on a patient's specific circumstances. To integrate evidence into practice, nurses must best identify searchable clinical questions by using the five-step approach outlined by Melnyk and Fineout-Overholt(2011). First, nurses need to identify a clinical question. One technique is to use thePICOT method to ask a searchable question. (PICOT stands for Population/PatientProblem, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, Time). Second, nurses must collectthe best evidence relevant to the question using key words from the PICOT questionto begin the search. Third, nurses should critically appraise the evidence before usingit, by evaluating the studies for validity, reliability, and applicability. This step en-sures the relevance and transferability of evidence to the specific population forwhom nurses provide care (Melnyk & Fineout-Overholt, 2011). Fourth, the evidenceshould be integrated with the other aspects of evidence-based practice. During thisstep, nurses need to incorporate the evidence using their expertise and the patient'spreferences to implement care. Finally, nurses should evaluate their practice decisionor change to determine whether it affected the patient's outcome. To use the evidence effectively to answer a clinical question and inform care delivery, nurses should also ask the following questions (DiCenso, Guyatt, &Ciliska, 2005, p. 51): 1.Are the study valid? 2.What are the results? 3.How can I apply these results to patient care?It is important for nurses to remember that evidence can include a variety of research and nonresearch sources and that some sources of evidence are stronger than other sources. Sources of evidence are categorized into levels andare rated according to their Figure illustrates this pyramidof evidence. There are numerous resources, preprocessed and unprocessed, available to nurses. Studies included in preprocessed databases have been reviewed before inclusion, are updated regularly, and consist of the most methodologically soundand clinically important studies (DiCenso, Guyatt, & pre-processed databases (www.thecochranelibrary.com)and Joanna Briggs Institute (www.joannabriggs.org). Unprocessed databases consist of original studies of excellent to poor quality; examples of unprocesseddatabases include the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature(CINAHL) and the National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE. Evidence should inform all nursing care. Safe and quality care requires basing nursing practice on the most current and best available knowledge. Evidence-based practice is critical in the quest for patient safety and quality care. The 14 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch01_001-026 14/01/17 3:48 PM Page 14fundamental elements of evidence-based practice are nursing research, the rela- tionship with quality improvement, clinical practice guidelines, and evidence-based management. Nursing Research Evidence-based practice should not be confused with nursing research. Nursing research is a systematic inquiry that uses disciplined methods to answer questions or solve problems. The goals of nursing research include generating, testing, orevaluating knowledge and developing reliable evidence about issues importantto the nursing profession (Polit & Beck, 2014). Nurses have a duty to advance theprofession through knowledge development and dissemination as well as appli-cation to practice. \"All nurses must participate in the advancement of the profes-sion through knowledge development, evaluation, dissemination, and applicationto practice\" (ANA, 2015a, p. 27). Rigorous nursing research provides one of thebest sources for evidence-based practice.Chapter 1 Core Competencies for Safe and Quality Nursing Care 15 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3Level 4Level 5Level 6Level 7Evidence from expert opinions- evidence.Evidence from a single descriptiveor qualitative study.Evidence from systematic reviews ofdescriptive and qualitative studies.Evidence from well-designedcase-control or cohort studies.Evidence trials without randomization.Evidence from at leastone well-designed RCT.Evidence from a systematic review or meta-analysis ofrandomized controlled trials (RCT), or evidence-basedclinical practice guidelines based on systematic reviewsor meta-analysis.Strongest level of evidence. Figure 1-1 Levels of Evidence. PM Page 15Relationship With Quality Improvement Quality improvement is also not the same as evidence-based practice. Although quality improvement is discussed later in this chapter and more thoroughly inChapter 7, it is important to address its relationship with evidence-based practicehere as well. Quality improvement is a cyclical process designed to monitor and eval- uate workflow and work processes. It can include data collection and analysis but has no theoretical foundation. Quality improvement uses benchmarks to mea -sure practice against established standards and provides methods to improve nurs-ing practice continually. Hedges (2006) discusses the \"three-legged stool\" of nursingpractice\u2014evidence-based practice, quality improvement, and nursing research\u2014and breaks down each element as inquiry processes that support nursing practice.She suggests that nurses can strengthen the foundation of nursing practice by usingquality improvement to monitor nursing practice and patient outcomes, systemat-ically reviewing the evidence using evidence-based practice, and conducting scientific studies through nursing research. Clinical Practice Guidelines Clinical practice guidelines are tools for clinicians to improve the quality and process of care delivery and patient outcomes and to reduce variations in care and health-carecosts. These guidelines are \"systematically developed statements to assist practitionerand patient decisions about appropriate healthcare for specific clinical circumstances\"(IOM, 1990, p. 38). Clinical practice guidelines gather, appraise, and combine evidenceand attempt to address issues relevant to a clinical decision. Moreover, they balancerisk and benefits and inform health-care clinicians (DiCenso, Guyatt, & Ciliska, 2005).Nurses must be involved in developing practice standards \"grounded in nursing'sethical commitments and developing body of knowledge . reflect nursing's respon-sibility to society\" (ANA, 2015a, 28). The National Guideline Clearinghouse(www.guideline.gov) and the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (rnao.ca/bpg)are two major sources of clinical practice guidelines for nurses. Evidence-Based Management Using evidence-based clinical practice when caring for patients is critical in provid-ing safe and quality care. Best practices and advances in organizational, leadership,and management research when carrying out leadership and management rolesshould also be considered. Evidence-based management is defined as \"making decisions through the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of four sources of information:practitioner expertise and judgment, evidence from the local context, a critical eval-uation of the best available research evidence, and the perspectives of those peoplewho might be affected by the decision\" (Briner, Denyer, & Rousseau, 2009). The IOM asserts that evidence-based management is critical to achieving safety in health care (Page, 2004). Evidence-based management includes managementstrategies informed by rigorous research and requires managers \"to search for, appraise, and apply empirical evidence from management research in their practice\"(Page, 2004, p. 113). Evidence-based management is discussed throughout this text.16 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch01_001-026 14/01/17 3:48 PM Page 16Therefore, only a brief discussion as it relates to the core competency of evidence- based practice and nursing leadership and management is included here. To foster an environment conducive to patient safety requires leadership capable of transforming both the physical environment and the beliefs and practices ofhealth-care workers. The IOM identifies five management practices that consistently contribute to the success of patient safety initiatives in spite of a high risk for error (Page, 2004, p. 108): 1.Balancing the tension between production efficiency and reliability 2.Creating and sustaining trust throughout the organization 3.Actively managing the process of change 4.Involving workers in decision making pertaining to work design and flow 5.Using knowledge management practices to establish the organization as a learn- ing organization Despite the evidence that these essential practices minimize threats to patient safety, they are not applied consistently. Therefore, the IOM recommends promot- ing evidence-based management practices to identify and minimize managementdecisions on patient safety (Page, 2004). Quality Improvement Reports from the IOM since the 1990s document evidence of serous quality prob-lems throughout the U.S. health-care system. In addition to substandard qualityof care, the health-care industry is notorious for inefficiency and waste. Health-care professionals are called to provide quality care, but what exactly is quality?The IOM (1990) defines quality as \"the degree to which health services for individ- uals and populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes and areconsistent with current professional knowledge\" (p. 4). The AHRQ (2005) suggeststhat providing quality health care involves striking the right balance of servicesby avoiding underuse and overuse and by eliminating misuse. Others posit thatapplying quality improvement methods used in the industrial sector can mitigateerrors, waste, and inefficiency (Greiner & Knebel, 2003). Regardless, nurses mustwork to provide high quality care to patients. Quality improvement originated in the industrial sector as a method to reduce errors in production processes, but its adoption by health-care organizations hasbeen slow. Constraints include lack of infrastructure and absence of leadershipamong health-care providers (Greiner & Knebel, 2003). The IOM has challengedthe health-care system to build on the experiences of high-risk industries, such asaviation and nuclear power, that have demonstrated enhanced safety and qualityby using quality improvement methods. The IOM defines \"apply quality improvement\" as follows: \"identify errors and hazards in care; understand and implement basic safety design principles, such asstandardization and simplification; continually understand and measure qualityof care in terms of structure, process, and outcomes in relation to patient and community needs; design and test interventions to change processes and systemsof care, with the objective of improving quality\" (Greiner & Knebel, 2003, p. 46).Chapter 1 Core Competencies for Safe and Quality Nursing Care 17 3021_Ch01_001-026 14/01/17 3:48 PM Page 17The skills related to this competency identified by the IOM include the following (Greiner & Knebel, 2003, p. 59): Assess current practices and compare them with relevant better practices elsewhere as a means of identifying opportunities for improvement. Design and test interventions to change the process of care, with the objective ofimproving quality. Identify errors and hazards in care, and understand and implement basic safetydesign principles, such as standardization and simplification and human factorstraining. Both act as an effective member of an interdisciplinary team and improve thequality of one's own performance through self-assessment and personal change. Patient safety and quality care require nurses to systematically identify potential and actual problems, explore potential and actual causes, and develop strategies forimprovement. Quality improvement is the responsibility of all nurses, regardless ofposition, in the health-care system. The nursing core competency of quality improve-ment is \"use data to monitor the outcomes of care processes and use improvementmethods to design and test changes to continuously improve the quality and safetyof healthcare systems\" (Cronenwett et al., 2007, p. 127). Quality improvement is acontinuous process in which nurses collect quality data to establish standards forcare delivery and monitor and evaluate those standards on an ongoing basis. Thefundamental elements of quality improvement include structure or care environment,the care process, and outcomes of care. Structure or Care Environment The structure or care environment essentially means the setting where nursing care is provided. Examples include the physical environment (e.g., the unit, a patientroom, a surgical suite, outpatient clinic, or a patient's home), equipment, staffing(including staff mix and staffing ratios), policies and procedures, the organizationalculture, and management of the organization. Care Process The care process focuses on how nursing care is provided. Examples of care process include models of care delivery such as primary care, Transforming Care at theBedside (TCAB), and case management. The care process also encompasses criticalpathways, standardized clinical guidelines, actual physical care of patients, assess-ment, intervention, patient education, timeliness of care, counseling, and leadershipand management activities. Outcomes of Care The outcomes of care include the results of all the nursing care provided and reflect the effectiveness of nursing activities. Examples of outcomes of care include lengthof stay, infection rates, patients' falls, postprocedure complications, and failure torescue. Currently, an approach is emerging that focuses on nursing-sensitive out-comes, or outcomes linked directly to the quantity and quality of nursing care.18 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch01_001-026 14/01/17 3:48 PM Page 18Informatics Informatics is more than merely using information technology; rather, it includes the development and application of information technology systems to health-careproblems, research, and education. Advances in technology has resulted in numer-ous innovations in health care including electronic health records, telehealth, remotemonitoring, and education through simulation (IOM, 2011). Successful use of infor-matics allows health-care professionals to manage knowledge and information, com-municate more effectively, and reduce more errors than in the past. (Chapter 9explores informatics in more depth.) The IOM defines informatics as follows: \"com- municate, manage knowledge, mitigate error, and support decision making usinginformation technology\" (Greiner & Knebel, 2003, p. 46). The skills related to this competency identified by the IOM include the following (Greiner & Knebel, 2003, p. 63): Employ word processing, presentation, and data analysis software. Search, retrieve, manage, and make decisions using electronic data from internalinformation databases and external online databases and the Internet. Communicate using e-mail, instant messaging, LISTSERV , and file transfers. Understand security protections such as access control, data security, and dataencryption, and directly address ethical and legal issues related to the use of information technology in practice. Enhance education and access to reliable health information for patients. Informatics integrates data, information, and knowledge to support the interpro- fessional team and is linked consistently to patient safety and quality (Greiner &Knebel, 2003; Warren, 2012). Safe and quality care requires information technologyto facilitate effective communication and documentation. Nurses must develop andmaintain their skills in informatics to use electronic health records, examine relevantevidence to support clinical decisions, solve patient and system problems, managequality improvement data, and share information (Sherwood & Barnsteiner, 2012).In light of this, the nursing core competency of informatics is defined as the \"use in-formation and technology to communicate, manage knowledge, mitigate error, andsupport decision-making\" (Cronenwett et al., 2007, p. 129). The incorporation of in-formatics in health care is inevitable, and nurses must develop the skills for enteringpatients' data and retrieving information for clinical decision making and qualityimprovement. Informatics is actually a thread through all of the QSEN competencies(Warren, 2012). The fundamental elements of informatics are information manage-ment and documentation. Information Management Nurses depend upon information to provide safe and quality care. How informa-tion is organized and presented influences how effectively and efficiently nursesdeliver care (Sewell, 2016). The Technology Informatics Guiding Education Reform(TIGER) was launched in 2006 to create a vision for the future of nursing in the digital age. Nine TIGER collaborative teams were formed to develop action plansrelated to key topic areas. The TIGER Informatics Computer Collaboration (TICC)Chapter 1 Core Competencies for Safe and Quality Nursing Care 19 3021_Ch01_001-026 14/01/17 3:48 PM Page 19team was charged with defining \"the minimum set of informatics competencies that all nurses need to succeed in practice or education in today's digital era\"(TIGER, 2009, p. 5). The TICC team developed a set of competencies related to in-formation management and contended that all practicing nurses should \"learn,demonstrate, and use information management competencies to carry out theirfundamental clinical responsibilities in an increasingly safe, effective, and efficientmanner\" (TIGER, 2009, p. 11). Information management is the process of collecting, analyzing, monitoring, sum- marizing, and communicating necessary information for health care (Greiner &Knebel, 2003; TIGER, 2009). Access to online databases provides nurses and otherhealth-care professionals with the literature and knowledge needed to implementevidence-based practice (Greiner & Knebel, 2003). Nurses manage information ina variety of ways, but \"the preferred or required method is through informationsystems\" (TIGER, 2009, p. 11). Skills in using information systems and patient caretechnologies that support delivery of safe patient care and a safe practice environ-ment are essential for all nurses (AACN, 2008). Documentation Nurses have a professional responsibility to document care planning, actual care pro-vided, and patient outcomes. Documentation is any written or electronically generated information about a patient that describes the care provided to that patient and offersan accurate account of what occurred and when it occurred. Nurses use documenta-tion to communicate all interactions with patients including assessments, interven-tions, evaluations, and outcomes of care. Documentation is maintained in a healthrecord, which may include paper or electronic documents such as electronic medicalrecords, faxes, e-mails, audio or video records, and images. Documentation is critical for effective intraprofessional and interprofessional communication. \"Clear, accurate and accessible documentation is an essential ele-ment of safe, quality, evidence-based nursing practice\" (ANA, 2010b, p. 3). Effectivedocumentation provides a foundation for demonstrating nursing's valuable contri-butions to patient outcomes as well as to the organizations that provide and supportquality patient care (ANA, 2010b). According to the ANA (2010b), documentationis critical to the nursing profession in the following areas: Communication within the health-care team and with other professionals Credentialing, legal, regulation, and legislation Reimbursement Research, quality process, and performance improvement Safety Although the IOM does not identify safety as a separate competency, it is includedas one of the six aims critical to improving the overall quality of health care as wellas safety for patients and health-care workers. The IOM's all-inclusive definitionof safety is \"freedom from accidental injury\" (IOM, 2001, p. 45). As discussed earlier in this chapter, the IOM report, To Err is Human, outlines recommendations for im- proving patient safety at the point of care delivery (Kohn, Corrigan, & Donaldson,20 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch01_001-026 14/01/17 3:48 PM Page 202000). The report also encourages health-care organizations to focus on creating environments that foster patient safety, or in other words, creating a safety culture.Key organizations committed to the patient safety movement include the AHRQ,NQF, TJC, and Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI). Although the quest for safe and quality health care has been ongoing for more than 2 decades, health-care professionals continue to fall short. Chassin and Loeb(2011) suggested that the health-care system is at a critical intersection at which patients in the hospital are increasingly vulnerable to harm from medical errors,and, unfortunately, the complexity of health care today increases the likelihood of medical errors. Safety does not just happen; it must be carefully orchestrated andrequires all staff to be adequately educated about patient safety and error preven-tion. Nurses, more than any other health-care professionals, have been identifiedas vital players in promoting patient safety. Nurses are able to recognize, interpret,evaluate, and correct health-care errors (AACN, 2008b). Safety is another competency that is present in all other QSEN competencies and is a common theme throughout this book. The safety core nursing compe-tency is defined as follows: \"minimize risk of harm to patients and providersthrough both system effectiveness and individual performance\" (Cronenwett et al., 2007, p. 128). The fundamental elements of safety include human errorsand human factors, standardized protocols and practice, safety culture, and high-reliability organizations. Human Errors and Factors Given the high complexity of the health-care environment today, errors are in-evitable. Human errors are acts of omission or commission leading to an undesirable outcome or the potential for an undesirable outcome (Wachter, 2012). Acts of omis-sion involve failing to do the right thing or omitting something that results in anerror, such as a nurse forgetting to give a patient a prescribed medication. Acts ofcommission involve doing something wrong or committing an error, such as anurse giving a patient the wrong medication. Human errors are discussed in moredetail in Chapter 7. Human factors engineering is a science that studies human capabilities and limita- tions and applies knowledge gleaned to the design of safe, effective processes andsystems for humans with the goal of achieving effective, efficient, and safe care(Boston-Fleischhauer, 2008a). Human factors engineering assumes that well-designed processes and systems take into account human capabilities and limita-tions outside the control of those working with the processes and systems. Suchlimitations can be 1) physical, such as noise, climate, lighting; 2) cognitive, involv-ing short-term memory capacity and fatigue; and 3) organizational, such as job andtask design (Boston-Fleischhauer, 2008a). Poorly designed processes and systemscan result in increased potential for errors and decreased patient safety (Boston-Fleischhauer, 2008a). Nurses must monitor, evaluate, and improve processes andsystems to ensure patient safety. Reliability science is \"the ability of an operation to be failure or defect free over- time\" (Boston-Fleischhauer, 2008b, p. 84). In other words, reliability science is em-ploying deliberate strategies that make it difficult for nurses to do the wrong thingChapter 1 Core Competencies for Safe and Quality Nursing Care 21 3021_Ch01_001-026 14/01/17 3:48 PM Page 21and easy to do the right thing. By designing simplistic processes and systems that are standardized and redundant, defy error, avoid reliance on memory, and employcontinuous vigilance, the goal of safe, quality patient care can be realized. Simplicityand standardizing care can reduce the probability of errors by decreasing variabilityof care. Standardized Protocols and Practice Standardized protocols can decrease preventable adverse events and medical errors. Common standard protocols are used to prevent mislabeling of radiographs,prevent wrong-site or wrong-patient procedure, and for labeling, packaging, andstoring medications (AHRQ, 2005). The AHRQ (2005) identifies the use of evidence-based practice and standardized tools as critical aspects of patient safety improve-ment. Standardized practice reflects current research findings and best practices and outlines the minimally accepted actions expected from health-care professionals.Standardized practice is linked to several other competencies such as evidence-based practice and quality improvement. Safety Culture Patient safety and quality care require a culture of safety. The IOM describes a safety culture as one in which \"an organization's care processes and workforce are focused on improving reliability and safety of care for patients\" (Kohn, Corrigan, & Donaldson, 2000, p. 114). The goal in a safety culture is to balance accountabilitywith the notion of \"no blame\" for errors (Wachter & Pronovost, 2009). Transparencyis critical in a safety culture. Staff must feel comfortable to report errors, near misses,and potential for errors. Five principles are necessary for the design of a safe health-care environment (Kohn, Corrigan, & Donaldson, 2000): Providing leadership: Make patient safety a priority objective and everyone's responsibility. Make sure assignments are clear, with an expectation of safetyoversight, and that there are effective mechanisms for identifying and dealing withunsafe practitioners. Provide human and financial resources for error analysis andsystem redesign. Respecting human limits in the design process: Design jobs for safety, and avoid reliance on memory and on vigilance. Simplify and standardize work processes. Promoting effective team functioning: Train health-care professionals expected to work in interprofessional teams with others who will be working with them. Anticipating the unexpected: Adopt a proactive approach. Identify threats to safety before an accident can occur, and redesign processes to prevent accidents. Creating a learning environment: Use simulation whenever feasible. Encourage transparency and reporting of errors without reprisals, and implement mecha-nisms for feedback and learning from errors. Develop a culture in which com-munication flows freely. Creating a safety culture requires nurse leaders and managers to take ownership of patient and worker safety and to foster a work environment in which safety is a22 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch01_001-026 14/01/17 3:48 PM Page 22top priority. Nurse leaders and managers must understand the complexities of the health-care system and the limits of human factors (Barnsteiner, 2012). High-Reliability Organizations High reliability refers to consistent performance at high levels of safety over time(Chassin & Loeb, 2011). The first industries to embrace high-reliability conceptswere aviation and nuclear power. High-reliability organizations create processes, systems, and a culture that radically reduce system failures and/or effectively respond when failures do occur (AHRQ, 2008). There are five characteristics fun-damental to designing processes and systems for high-reliability organizations(AHRQ, 2008, p. 1): 1.Sensitivity to operations: Leaders and staff must be constantly aware of risks to patient safety and focus on preventing them. 2.Reluctance to simplify: Avoiding overly simple explanations of failures is essential to understand the true reasons that patient safety is in jeopardy. 3.Preoccupation with failure: Leaders and staff must view near misses as evidence that systems should be improved, rather than as proof that the system is working effectively. 4.Deference to expertise: Leaders and managers must listen and respond to the insights of frontline staff. 5.Resilience: Leaders and staff must be educated and prepared to respond when system failures do occur. Overall, leaders, managers, and frontline staff must embrace a high-reliability mindset to become a high-reliability organization. High-reliability organizations foster a learning environment and promote a safety culture, evidence-based prac-tice, and a positive work environment for nurses. In addition, they are committedto improving the safety and quality of care. CURRENT STATE OF SAFETY AND QUALITY There is strong evidence that links nursing practice to patient safety and quality ofcare (IOM, 2011). Since the publication of the IOM report To Err is Human , there has been a diligent quest to improve the safety and quality of health care. However, somecontend that progress has been frustratingly slow (James, 2013; Wachter, 2012). Thereis some speculation that the IOM's estimate of 44,000 to 98,000 deaths from prevent-able adverse events was an underestimate and that far more lethal errors actuallyoccur each year (Huston, 2014; Wachter, 2012). In his study, James (2013) contendedthat health care is experiencing a major epidemic of patient harm. He found that thereare, at a minimum, 210,000 lethal preventable adverse events annually. Nurses play acritical role in preventing medication errors, decreasing infection rates, and safe tran-sitions from hospital to home (IOM, 2011). James's study further substantiates the needto prepare nurses with the necessary knowledge, skills, and attitudes to deliver patient-centered care as members of interprofessional teams, emphasizing evidence-based practice, quality improvement, and informatics (Cronenwett, et al., 2007).Chapter 1 Core Competencies for Safe and Quality Nursing Care 23 3021_Ch01_001-026 14/01/17 3:48 PM Page 23SUMMARY Effective nursing leadership and management are critical to providing patients with safe, effective, and quality care. Care must be patient-centered, involving the patientand his or her family in all health-care decisions. In addition, the work environmentmust foster collaboration and teamwork and must include effective interprofessionaland intraprofessional communication. Safe and quality care requires nurses to basetheir practice on the most current available knowledge. Nurse leaders and managersmust also employ management strategies that are informed by rigorous research toreduce threats to patient safety and to enhance the work environment for staff. Quality of nursing care considers where the care is provided, how the care is provided, and the results or outcomes of the care provided. Nurses must learn touse technology to systematically identify potential and actual problems and theircauses, and they need to develop strategies for prevention and improvement. Theultimate goal of quality improvement is patient and staff safety. Nurses are not expected to be perfect; they are human and will make errors. Nurse leaders andmanagers must strive for a culture of safety that recognizes the limitations ofhuman factors and takes a proactive approach to prevention of errors.

This arena includes personal living spaces, providers' offices and clinics, hospitals, extended or skilled nursing care facilities, nursing homes and hospices, numerous service organizations related to health, private and publichealth systems, and a plethora of other locations and entities providing support andservices. Service providers commonly include the pharmaceutical industry, labora-tory or radiological services, and, more recently, information technology services. Essentially, health care within the system can transpire at any time or in any locationwhere health-care providers, or their surrogates, interact with persons needing orseeking health care or where their personal health information is accessed. The status of the health-care system in the United States has changed signifi- cantly since 2010 with the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable CareKEY TERMS Affordable Care Act (ACA) Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) Government health careHealth professional shortage area (HPSA) MedicaidMedicareNational or universal health carePrivate health carePublic health careUnderinsuredUninsuredLEARNING OUTCOMES Explore differences between private and public, including government- provided, health care.

The number of uninsured is expected to decrease over time; however, access to health care, complicated by a lack of providers and services, is of concern to all health-care providers. The costof health care and the quality of care provided continue to be of paramount impor-tance to nurse leaders and managers who are faced with the consequences of therising costs of health care, decreasing reimbursement for health-care services, andlimited resources. Many believe that the ACA will transform the health-care system in the United States and provide safer, higher-quality, more affordable, and more accessible care(Institute of Medicine [IOM], 2011). Strong nursing leadership is necessary to makethis vision a reality. Nurses are called to be leaders \"from the bedside to the board-room\" (IOM, 2011, p. 7). Equally important is that all nurses, students, bedside andcommunity nurses, chief nursing officers, members of nursing organizations, andnursing researchers must develop leadership competencies, especially those relatedto health policy (IOM, 2011). Nurse leaders and managers determine policies, procedures, and resources for their staff members and facilities to provide safe and quality care and ensureevidence-based interventions to assist in the control of costs and in improved patient outcomes. Nurse leaders and managers must advocate for society by serv-ing as experts in promoting and implementing health policies. Further, nurses areexperts in health and should be at the table where and when policies are developedthat affect the populations with which they interact. This chapter discusses the current status of health care in the United States, the ACA, Medicare and Medicaid, health policy, and the role nurse leaders andmanagers play in these issues. Knowledge, skills, and attitudes related to the following core competencies are included in this chapter: patient-centered care; teamwork and collaboration; andevidence-based practice. SYSTEMS WITHIN THE HEALTH-CARE ENVIRONMENT Health care in most cases can be broken down into private and public health-caresectors. Private health-care sectors include companies, for profit and nonprofit, notassociated directly with government agencies, whereas public health-care sectorsare often funded by tax dollars. Private health care is monetarily compensated health care that is provided to indi- viduals seeking care within the health-care environment. The payment for privatehealth care is usually predetermined and sometimes negotiated with health-careproviders. The cost of services can be paid directly to the provider by a monetarypayment or rendered through government or commercial (private) health insurers,also known as third-party payers. Private health care is the predominant form ofhealth care for persons residing in the United States. Reporting for the U.S. Depart-ment of Commerce, United States Census Bureau, Smith and Medalia (2014) esti-mated that 64.2% of individuals were covered by private health insurance in 2013,of which 53.9% was employment based (provided through an employer). The totalpercentage of people with health insurance was estimated at 86.6% in 2013.28 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch02_027-044 14/01/17 3:56 PM Page 28The U.S. private health-care system is often referred to as \"the greatest health care system in the world\" but yet is ranked 37th in the world (Murray & Frank, 2010). Life expectancy is often considered a measure of the adequacy of a health-care system's influence on its population. According to the World Health Organ-ization (WHO, 2014), combined life expectancy in the United States is 79 yearsfor both males and females (76 for males and 81 for females); however, it doesnot rank within the 10 top-ranked countries for life expectancy in either male orfemale categories (WHO, 2014). Public health care , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Foundation, \"is the science of protecting and improving the health of fami-lies and communities through promotion of healthy lifestyles, research for diseaseand injury prevention and detection and control of infectious diseases\" (CDC Foun-dation, 2016, para. 1). All states have public health departments that support thisrole and must report to U.S. government health agencies such as the CDC, whichis a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In certain statesand communities, public health departments often provide primary care to indigentpopulations and underserved populations. Vaccination service and sexually trans-mitted disease clinics are frequently operated by state and county health depart-ments. These services usually offer reduced payment options or free care forqualified individuals. The Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service, also a branch of the Department of Health and Human Services, is a commissioned corps ofhealth-care providers, including nurses, similar to the military with regard torank and retirement. Members of this corps work in a number of health-care are-nas, including the CDC, National Institutes of Health, Indian Health Service, Foodand Drug Administration, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ),and many more. Government health care in the United States is not provided directly by the govern- ment in most cases. The term actually refers to government-provided health insur-ance, such as Medicare and Medicaid (discussed later in this chapter), which isactually provided by the private health-care system. The Veterans Health Administration and military hospitals and clinics are directly funded by tax dollars and provide care directly to active duty militarypersonnel and former service members of the armed services (Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard). These are actual representations ofgovernment-provided health care within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)and Department of Defense (DOD) system. Both agencies maintain numerousoutpatient facilities and hospitals. The VA is primarily staffed by civilians,whereas the DOD has a considerable number of active duty personnel staffingmilitary clinics and hospitals. In the United States, charity care or reduced-cost care exists for persons who do not have adequate access to the private, public, or government health-care systemsas a result of life circumstances (e.g., financial, geographic, lack of transportation).However, this care is very limited in scope and location. National or universal health care refers to health care provided to citizens through the government, usually without the involvement of private health insurers. Chapter 2 Health-Care Environment and Policy 29 3021_Ch02_027-044 14/01/17 3:56 PM Page 29Currently, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland), and many other European countries provide this type ofhealth care to their citizens. Although there are many advocates for the implemen-tation of a national or universal health-care system in the United States, politicallyand culturally it is not likely to occur in the near future. CURRENT STATUS OF HEALTH CARE IN THE UNITED STATES Although there have been recent changes to laws intended to improve the health-care system, specifically the ACA, the U.S. health-care system continues to beplagued by barriers stemming from an inability to access the system, cost of care,and quality of care provided (Davidson, 2013) (Fig. 2-1). Access to Health Care Accessibility to health care \"is particularly hard to disentangle from considerationsof health care quality in that it is a prerequisite to receipt of quality health care\"(Docteur & Berenson, 2009, p 2). Health-care quality in the United States appearslow in comparison with other countries with regard to prevention and care ofchronic conditions. Access barriers experienced by the uninsured (those without health-care insurance coverage) and underinsured (those who have insurance cover- age but lack adequate income to facilitate access to care because of high deductiblesand co-payments) likely contribute to decreased health-care quality (Docteur &Berenson, 2009). There are primarily two avenues through which health care can be accessed in the United States. The first is through a physician or care provider practice orclinic, and the other is through a hospital emergency department. Provider prac-tices and clinics are generally not required to accept patients with the inability topay for services provided. Emergency departments, conversely, are subject to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) that requires that \"all Medicare participating hospitals with emergency departments provide stabilizing emer-gency care for all patients seeking help (including patients in labor), regardlessof their insurance status or ability to pay\" (La Couture, 2015, p. 1). Often this results in what is considered inappropriate use of the emergency department. Inmany cases, extended wait times and delays in transfer of patients to inpatientbeds result in low patient satisfaction. Developing accurate models of emergencydepartment service completion times is a critical first step in identifying barriersto patient flow and patient wait times (Ding et al., 2010).30 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND US Health-care System Access Cost Quality Figure 2-1 Barriers within the U.S. health-care system. 3021_Ch02_027-044 14/01/17 3:56 PM Page 30Nurses at all levels must understand the implications of ineffective access to the health-care system. This may manifest as a patient who is seen in the emer- gency department, perhaps on numerous occasions secondary to lack of insur-ance. This situation may translate into an inability to access more affordable careby a primary care provider. Traditionally, nurses have not concerned themselveswith how a patient pays for services rendered because, in theory, care is providedto each patient in the same manner regardless of ability to pay. Often, however,these patients are labeled as noncompliant, and caring for them in a busy emer-gency department can be stressful when more urgent needs are evident. This situation is grossly unfair to these patients and does affect how they are treated inthe emergency department. Further, labeling and treating patients in this mannerviolate provision one of the American Nurses Association (ANA) Code of Ethics forNurses With Interpretive Statements (2015), \"The nurse practices with compassion and respect for the inherent dignity, worth, and unique attributes of every person\"(p. 1). The same can be said for patients admitted to the hospital repeatedly forthe same condition. Nurses should consider whether this occurs as a consequenceof inadequate access or inability to afford medications for their condition. Nurse leaders and managers set the vision for nursing practice in the delivery of safe and quality nursing care. To that end, nurse leaders and managers musthave effective communication and relationship-building skills, according to theAmerican Organization of Nurse Executives (AONE, 2015a & AONE, 2015b). Theseskills would manifest in nurses' ability to influence behavior by asserting theirviews in a nonthreatening, nonjudgmental way and inspiring desired behaviors,while also managing undesired behaviors. Nurse leaders and managers must also fully investigate barriers within the sys- tem that increase wait times and decrease patient flow in the emergency depart-ment and transfer to an inpatient bed. Considerations should include acceptabletime frames for patients' discharge, staffing barriers preventing notification ofhousekeeping staff to prepare the room once the patient is discharged, admissiontiming from the emergency department to the inpatient bed, and adequate staffingof all personnel to facilitate these processes. Nurse leaders and managers mustwork to eliminate these barriers to ensure that care is safe, timely, efficient, equi-table, evidence-based, and patient centered. The Cost of Health Care In the year 2000, the United States was estimated to have spent $4,703 per personfor health care. By 2010, that figure had increased to $8,233 per person, an increaseof $3,530 per person. Considering all countries within the Region of the Americas,which includes the United States, Canada, and all Central and South Americancountries, combined spending in all of these countries including the United Stateswas $1,985 per person in 2000 and $3,454 per person in 2010 (WHO, 2013). Thecombined totals for the remaining five WHO regions (African, South-East Asia, European, Eastern Mediterranean, and Western Pacific regions) surpass the per capita total expenditure of the United States on health care per person by $2,873and $4,696, respectively, for 2000 and 2010.Chapter 2 Health-Care Environment and Policy 31 3021_Ch02_027-044 14/01/17 3:56 PM Page 31If one views the U.S. health-care system from the health-care provider perspec- tive, the revelation that \"insurers do not cover provider costs\" can be surmised (Davidson, 2013, p. 9). Davidson estimates that individuals without insurance payamounts closest to actual charges, or approximately 90% of actual costs. Those withprivate insurance pay approximately 65% to 75% of actual charges, depending onthe insurer, and those with Medicare pay approximately 65% of actual providercosts. Medicaid has historically paid an even smaller percentage of actual providercosts; this applies to services at individual health-care practices as well as hospitalsand other larger facilities. These unpaid costs are commonly referred to as uncom-pensated care (Fig. 2-2). Many advocate for charity care or reduced-cost care for the uninsured or under- insured. In the United States, charity care or reduced cost care exists for personswho do not have adequate access to the private, public, or government health-caresystems or insurance as a result of life circumstances. As mentioned earlier, thistype of health care is very limited in scope and location and, for the most part, isalso uncompensated care. Secondary to EMTALA, hospitals with emergency departments accepting Medicare are required to stabilize all patients regardless of their ability to pay. In-conveniently, persons unable to access the health-care system through a provider'soffice or clinic often use the emergency department for care that could easily beprovided in a primary care setting and at a substantial cost reduction. This resultsin uncompensated excessive costs for services that normally would cost much lessif care had been provided by a primary care provider. Inherent in this untenable situation is that inefficiency permeates the system, and individual service costs increase yearly, commonly in response to increasedcosts for supplies, medications, and professionals' compensation (Davidson,2013). Despite the increasing costs of the system, in 2013 the CommonwealthFund Commission on a High Performance Health System noted, \"There is broadevidence . . . that much of the excess spending is wasteful\" (2013, p. 7). Nurses at all levels must be aware of the limitations under which health-care systems operate. Labor is the largest component of total costs, with nursing being32 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35% 35% Uninsured10% 14/01/17 3:56 PM Page 32the largest of that component. In hospitals, labor correlates closely with total expenses. Hospital operating margins, the comparison of the operating budgetcompared with total income, vary per system, but usually operations leave lessthan 5% to 6% of total income available for profit (Health Leaders Media, 2015).Nurses must be cognizant of their contribution to increasing costs to the systemand make a concerted effort to be good stewards of available resources in the delivery of safe and quality nursing care. Nurse leaders and managers must be accountable for nursing expenditures, budgets, and outcomes. Skills required, according to the AONE (2015a), include financial management, human resources management, strategic planning, and in-formation management and technology. Financial management includes manage-ment of annual operating budgets and long-term expenditures and education ofpatient care team members in relation to financial implications of patient care decisions. Human resources management includes the development of educationalprograms, workforce planning or employment decisions, corrective discipline, em-ployee satisfaction, reward and recognition programs, promotion of healthy workenvironments, and compliance with legal and regulatory guidelines. Strategic man-agement includes defending the business component of nursing, the analysis of market data in relation to supply and demand, and promotion of the image of nurs-ing and the organization through effective media. Information technology and man-agement consist of using technology to support clinical and financial improvements;collaborating to establish information technology resources, evaluate technology inpractice settings, and use data management systems for decision making; demon-strating skills in assessing data integrity and quality; and leading the adoption andimplementation of information systems (AONE, 2015a). Quality of Care The IOM defines quality health care as \"the degree to which health services for in-dividuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes andare consistent with current professional knowledge\" (Lohr, 1990, p. 128). The AHRQstates that \"quality health care means doing the right thing at the right time in theright way for the right person and having the best results possible\" (1998, p. 1).Quality of care typically reflects the positive effects of health care and performanceof health-care systems (Docteur & Berenson, 2009). According to the 2014 NationalHealthcare Quality and Disparities Report, the current National Quality Strategyhas six priorities. These priorities and their current findings, as of 2014, conclude(AHRQ, 2015): 1.Patient safety: 50% of measures improved with a 17% reduction in hospital- acquired infections 2.Person-centered care: Improved steadily, especially in children 3.Care coordination: Improved with enhanced discharge processes and health information technologies 4.Effective treatment: Achieved high levels of performance in hospitals, led by mea - sures reported by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on Hospital CompareChapter 2 Health-Care Environment and Policy 33 3021_Ch02_027-044 14/01/17 3:56 PM Page 335.Healthy living: Improved in about 50% of measures, led by selected adolescent vaccines 6.Care affordability: Worsened from 2002 through 2010 and then leveled off Patient safety problems appear to be greater in the United States, where patients are more likely to report mistakes or adverse effects with regard to safe medication practices (Docteur & Berenson, 2009). The United States also has \"the highest ratesof problems such as being given the wrong medication or dosage, experiencing amedical error, or facing delays in hearing about abnormal test results,\" with ratesreported as high as 34% (Docteur & Benson 2009, p. 8). Fatalities resulting from medical errors in the United States were estimated to be 98,000 per year by the IOM in 1999. A newer, evidenced-based estimatewas provided by James (2013), with a lower estimate as high as 210,000 fatalitiesper year and an upper estimate of premature death from medical harm as highas 400,000 per year. In addition, James stated that \"serious harm seems to be 10-20 fold more common than lethal harm\" (James, 2013, p. 122). High quality implies excellent health outcomes, and there is the assumption that \"Americans with good insurance coverage uniquely benefit from prompt availabil-ity and accessibility of cutting-edge medical procedures, medicines, and devices,as well as highly educated and well-trained health-care professionals, who knowand consistently do what is best for their patients\" (Docteur & Berenson, 2009, p. 2). As a whole, the United States actually has an inferior quality of care comparedwith poorer populations. Life expectancy in the United States, which is below average when compared with that in other developed countries, is among the worst performers. The United States has \"a much higher prevalence of nine of tenconditions, including cancer, heart disease, and stroke, in its population over 50\"(Docteur & Berenson, 2009, p. 4). According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 2015), in comparing the United States with other member states, \"the qual-ity of acute care in hospitals in the United States is excellent, but the U.S. healthsystem is not performing very well in avoiding hospital admissions for people withchronic diseases.\" The OECD found that for conditions such as heart attack, stroke,and general lifesaving, the system performed well. For chronic conditions such asasthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, and diabetes, the United States fell shortin areas involving patients in self-care and providing effective counseling for dietand the importance of regular exercise to moderate these chronic conditions(OECD, 2015). Nurses at all levels need to be familiar with the safety and quality of care they provide patients and the issues associated with safe provision of nursing care.Knowledge deficits were noted by James (2013) to be a major contributor to indi-vidual and system deficiencies leading to medical errors and patient harm. Thesedeficiencies can be rectified with comprehensive continuing education within allof the health professions (James, 2013). Nurse leaders and managers need to assist staff in attaining adequate continuing education with a focus on evidence-based practice. Evidence-based practice andthe methods by which it is implemented have only recently been included in thenursing curriculum at the baccalaureate (BSN) level. Older staff members and those34 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch02_027-044 14/01/17 3:56 PM Page 34educated with less than a BSN require instruction in the importance of evidence- based practice and how to become involved in bringing forth policies and proceduresthat are evidence based. According to the AONE (2015a), clinical practice knowledgeis a core competency. Leaders and managers are responsible for demonstrating\"knowledge of current nursing practice and the roles of patient care team members\"(AONE, 2015a, p. 6). The following are central to leadership roles: communication ofpatient care standards; compliance with state nurse practice acts, as well as accredi-tation, regulatory, and quality agency requirements; and adherence to professionalstandards of nursing practice. These requirements will need to be written into policiesand procedures while integrating bioethical, legal requirements (AONE, 2015a). Lack of Providers and Services When viewing the U.S. health-care system from an individual perspective, threereasons can account for an inability to access the system: 1) living in an area withinadequate services, 2) lack of health insurance, and 3) cost prohibitions for thosewith health insurance as a result of out-of-pocket expenses (e.g., deductibles, co-payments) (Davidson, 2013) (Fig. 2-3). Directly related to the issue of access to care is an inadequate supply of health- care providers and other health-care professionals as well as hospitals and facilitiesin certain areas. Most of these supply issues occur in rural areas (Davidson, 2013).The \"availability of providers and services, coverage, benefits and affordability allChapter 2 Health-Care Environment and Policy 35 Lack of Providers and ServiceLack of Health Insurance Access DeniedInsured With Limited Income Figure 2-3 Health-care access barriers.3021_Ch02_027-044 14/01/17 3:56 PM Page 35come into play as potential explanations for different user experiences with the health care system and the outcomes attained\" (Docteur & Berenson, 2009, p. 2). Shortages of health professionals exist in all states, including urban areas. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) defines health professional shortage areas (HPSAs) as \"areas or populations designated by HRSA as having too few primary care providers, high infant mortality, high poverty or a high elderlypopulation\" (HRSA, n.d.). Figure 2-4 shows HPSAs in primary care, which includesphysicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. Lack of Health Insurance and Insurance With Limited Income Before the implementation of the ACA, 32 million people in the United Stateslacked health insurance even though many worked multiple jobs or full-time jobs(Jacobs & Skocpol, 2012). Millions of other individuals had health insurance butwere considered underinsured. Out-of-pocket costs for the underinsured were 36 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND Health Professional Shortage Areas - Primary Care Prepared by: HRSA, Office of Information Technology from the HRSA Data Warehouse, datawarehouse.hrsa.govHPSA Geographic HPSA PopulationHPSA Geographic High NeedsNot Primary Care HPSALegend Health Professional Shortage Areas - Primary CareAlaska US Virgin Islands Puerto Rico Republic of PalauGuam HawaiiAmericanSamoa Figure 2-4 Health professional shortage areas (HPSAs) in primary care provided by the Health Resources and Services Administration data warehouse (additional interactive maps can be found at datawarehouse.hrsa.gov/topics/shortageAreas.aspx).3021_Ch02_027-044 14/01/17 3:56 PM Page 36estimated at 29.1% of total health-care costs in the United States in 2009 (Davidson, 2013). The number of uninsured persons in 2013 rose to 42 million (Smith &Medalia, 2014). In the first half of 2014, the rate of the uninsured among adults 18 to 65 years of age decreased substantially. The ACA is credited with this decline (AHRQ, 2015). Although the ACA mandated that residents within the United States have health insurance or face a tax imposed by the Internal Revenue Service, the cost of healthinsurance for those who did not qualify for a health-care tax subsidy remained anobstacle for many persons, especially those not receiving health-care benefitsthrough an employer. The percentage of persons receiving health insurance throughtheir employer was 53.9% in 2013 (Smith & Medalia, 2014). Individuals are often blamed for their own circumstances, including their inabil- ity to have an adequate income or to find better employment to obtain adequatehealth insurance. They are often stigmatized for health issues that could be managedby exercise and other lifestyle decisions (Davidson, 2013), yet the OECD found thatthe health-care system fell short with regard to incorporating these recommenda-tions in primary care (OECD, 2015). Frequently, this is an example of the influenceof social determinants of health that consist of patients' lifestyles and incorporatetheir social and physical environment. Lifestyle and environment are then modifiedby patients' access to public health services and medical and mental health care. Individual responses to these determinants interact with human biology to influenceoverall health status further (Arah et al., 2006). These individuals may be powerlessto facilitate the changes necessary to overcome these obstacles and collectively havelittle support to facilitate change within the system. THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT The ACA was enacted into law on March 23, 2010, after a lengthy political battle.The ultimate goal of this law was to reduce the number of uninsured persons in theUnited States by expanding Medicaid and implementing health-care exchanges. Thehealth-care exchanges would allow the uninsured and other eligible persons to select health insurance coverage, which would include essential health benefits (Box 2-1), through state or federal exchanges. Many eligible persons would also receive government subsidies that would make health care affordable to those whoqualified based on their income (Henry J. Kaiser Foundation, 2016).Chapter 2 Health-Care Environment and Policy 37 BOX 2-1BOX 2-1 Ten Essential Health Benefits Required Ten Essential Health Benefits Required by the Affordable Care Actby the Affordable Care Act 1.Ambulatory patient services 2.Emergency services 3.Hospitalization 4.Maternity and newborn care 5.Mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment6.Prescription drugs 7.Rehabilitative services and devices 8.Laboratory services 9.Preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management 10.Pediatric services, including oral and vision care From Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2011. 3021_Ch02_027-044 14/01/17 3:56 PM Page 37Provisions included in the ACA guarantee availability of insurance with the elimination of pre-existing conditions as a means of denial for insurance. Other requirements of the ACA include the following: no annual limits on coverage;mandated coverage by employers with at least 50 full-time employees; extensionof coverage to adult children to age 26 years with individual and group healthpolicies; the inclusion of preventive services without cost sharing, if recommendedby the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force; and limitation of annual cost sharingto the maximums allowed for health savings accounts ($5,950 for individual plansand $11,900 for families) (Henry J. Kaiser Foundation, 2016). Lesser-known stipulations of the ACA are annual taxes for individuals without health insurance coverage, a 10% tax on indoor tanning services, an annual fee paidby the pharmaceutical industry, an excise tax of 2.3% on any taxable medical device,and a fee of no less than $2,000 per employee for an employer not offering healthinsurance where an employee receives a tax credit (Henry J. Kaiser Foundation,2016). On June 28, 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court, in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, determined that the ACA was constitutional with the excep- tion of the portion requiring states to participate in Medicaid expansion. This portion was deemed coercive because all Medicaid funds would be at risk, andstates were not given adequate notice to consent voluntarily (Holahan, Buettgens,Carroll, & Dorn, 2012). Before the U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the constitution-ality of the ACA, expansion of Medicaid by the states was required or states wouldforfeit their federal Medicaid funding (Diamond, 2012). After the Supreme Courtruling, states would forfeit new Medicaid funding only if they opted out of Medicaid expansion. The requirement to expand Medicaid by the states was leftto the discretion of each individual state after the court's ruling. In 2015, 21 stateshad continued to decline expansion of Medicaid secondary to the Supreme Court'sruling. Medicaid expansion by states can be tracked at www.statereforum.org/medicaid-expansion-decisions.38 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND MEDICARE AND MEDICAID In the United States, Medicare and Medicaid are forms of government-provided health insurance, primarily for disabled persons, older persons, and economically disadvantaged persons, including children. Both programs are overseen by theCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), a division of the U.S. Depart-ment of Health and Human Services. Medicare provides health insurance for disabled persons and persons age 65 and older and consists of four components:Parts A, B, C, and D. Table 2-1 provides brief explanations of the components ofMedicare.

As of 2016, the eligibility age is 65 years, although there has been discussion about amending eligibility criteria for many years (Medicare.gov, n.d.). Medicaid provides health care coverage to low-income people (primarily for children, nondisabled adults, and pregnant women) and is one of the largest payersfor health care in the United States. The Children's Health Insurance Program, also known as CHIP , is the Medicaid program for children and provides federalmatching funds to states who provide health care coverage to children in familieswho cannot afford private insurance but have incomes too high to qualify for Medicaid. As of May, 2016, there were more than 8.3 million children enrolled inCHIP (Medicaid.gov, n.d.). At the time the ACA became law, 32 million Americans lacked health insurance, and although provisions were provided in the ACA to allow greater access to Med-icaid, many states were allowed to opt out of expanding Medicaid, a key provision3021_Ch02_027-044 14/01/17 3:56 PM Page 39within the law, as a result of the Supreme Court ruling in June 2012. Although this situation has denied a large percentage of the uninsured access to the system, pres-sure from health-care providers and health-care systems will likely prevail in expanding Medicaid after initial implementation (Jacobs & Skocpol, 2012). A key provision of the ACA's Medicaid expansion was the eligibility of adults without dependent children to qualify for Medicaid. Before the ACA, Medicaid eligibility was available only to low-income individuals such as children, olderadults, or disabled persons. The income eligibility level for Medicaid, before theACA, was significantly less than required by the ACA, which extended eligibilityto 138% of poverty guidelines (Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured,2014). The Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured (2014) identifiedanother unfortunate consequence of states' not expanding Medicaid. The originallaw required Medicaid expansion by all states and did not anticipate the gap thatwould occur between those eligible for Medicaid at current state levels and thosewho would not be eligible for Medicaid if a state opted out of Medicaid expansion.The persons within this gap, which equated with the state's established income eligibility for Medicaid through incomes up to 138% of poverty guidelines, wouldsubsequently not qualify for marketplace tax credits, even though they were noteligible for Medicaid. Those numbers equated with 5.2 million persons nationwidewho would be denied access to the new health-care system (Kaiser Commissionon Medicaid and the Uninsured, 2014). HEALTH POLICY Health policy is developed at the local, state, national, and international levels. It canbe developed by the following: citizens' actions, local policies, and proceedings; leg-islation at the state or federal level; or international arrangements and policies of international groups, such as the WHO. The incorporation of walking or biking pathsin a locality is an example of implementation of local health policy. State health policiesare developed by the local health department or through the legislative body of stategovernment. The ACA is a legislative action or health policy conducted at the nationallevel. International health policies are often the result of foundations, such as the Clin-ton Foundation or the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, or individual philanthropy.Some organizations are primarily devoted to the business of health policy, such as theRobert Wood Johnson Foundation or the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. TheWHO develops many policies associated with international public health. A call has been made for nurses to be active in the formation of public health pol- icy. As Byrd and colleagues found, \"the importance of nurses' involvement in shap-ing public policy to promote population health is widely documented in nursingand public health\" (2012, p. 433). In fact, the AACN established specific requirementsaddressing health policy through their Essentials documents that guide schools ofnursing in developing curricula at all levels: The Essentials of Baccalaureate Education for Professional Nursing Practice (2008), The Essentials of Master's Education in Nursing (2011), and The Essentials for Doctoral Education for Advanced Nursing Practice (2006). Nurses at all levels must be involved in health policy to advance health care in theUnited States. It is critical for all nurses to see health policy \"as something they canshape rather than something that happens to them. Nurses should have a voice in40 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch02_027-044 14/01/17 3:56 PM Page 40health policy decision making\" and participate in implementation efforts (IOM, 2011, p. 9). Further, nurses and nurse leaders and managers have an ethical respon-sibility to be involved in policy development and implementation by serving on committees within their practice settings. Nurse leaders and managers can contribute to health policy by serving as elected or appointed representatives inhealth-care activities at the local, state, national, and global levels (ANA, 2015).Chapter 2 Health-Care Environment and Policy 41 Byrd, M. E., Costello, J., Gremel, K. Schwager, J., Blanchette, L, & Malloy, T. E. (2012). Political astuteness of baccalaureate nursing students following an activelearning experience in health policy. Public Health Nursing, 29(5), 433-443. Aim The aim of this study was to measure undergraduate nursing students' level of political astuteness before and after they participated in a series of public policylearning activities, as well as to describe changes in conceptual factors and the extent to which other factors predict political involvement. Methods A one-group pretest/posttest design was used to measure changes in political as-tuteness in 300 undergraduate nursing students after three public policy learningexperiences: 1. Students attended information sessions at the Rhode Island Department of Health. 2. Students composed a letter or e-mail to their legislators about a health-related issue they were concerned about. 3. Students completed a public policy project. Students were administered the Political Astuteness Inventory (PAI) before and after they participated in the learning activities. Key Findings Students' political astuteness increased after they participated in the public policy activities. The findings suggest that students were more knowledgeable about governmental and political processes that are essential for policy making related to community health after the learning experiences than before. Further, the expe-riences promoted self-reflection and raised students' awareness of the importanceof public policy and political involvement for nurses. Implications for Nurse Leaders and Managers This study substantiates the need to ensure that learning activities related to publicpolicy and health policy are included in nursing education at all levels. Nurseleaders and managers can apply this evidence with their staff to promote politicalinvolvement. All nurses can participate in activities at the local, state, and nationallevels. Active involvement can promote competency development in health policy.EXPLORING THE EVIDENCE 2-13021_Ch02_027-044 14/01/17 3:56 PM Page 41Many nursing professional organizations are involved in health policy advo- cacy, and \"more than ever before nurses are crucial to building and strengthening the health care systems within which they work\" (Bryant, 2012, p. 438). Byrd and colleagues (2012) concluded, \"active learning in public policy can increasethe knowledge and skills that future nurses need to influence public policy\" (p. 433).42 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND LEARNING ACTIVITY 2-2State Nurse Legislators Review the ANA's information on nurse state legislators at www.nursingworld.org/MainMenuCategories/Policy-Advocacy/Nurse-Legislators. How many states have nurse legislators? Does your state have a nurse legislator? SUMMARY Nurses at all levels are impacted by the rapidly changing health-care environment, rising costs of care, safety and quality issues, and access to care. Nurses must beaware of the consequences of inadequate access to health care for patients. Nurseleaders and managers need to develop effective communication and relationshipbuilding skills to be able to advocate for patients as they attempt to navigate healthcare systems. All nurses must have a basic understanding of the broader context ofhealth care and health-care policy. The ACA was intended to assist those uninsuredand underinsured, help with controlling costs of health care, expand access to care,expand the Medicaid gap, and improve the safety and quality of care. Populationheath is fueled by health policy. Effective nurse leaders and managers will developcompetencies in financial management, human resource management, strategicmanagement, and information management and technology. Further, nurse leadersand managers have an ethical responsibility to take an active role in developingand implementing health policy.

Describe contemporary leadership theories. Describe primary characteristics of leaders and managers. Examine the value of self-awareness and emotional intelligence in leadership. Determine how leaders can identify different types of followers. Explain how leaders and managers can be effective mentors. Because nurses embody the largest number of professionals in health care, they are most often the closest to the patient and therefore offer a unique perspective of the entire system of care surrounding the patient. This places nurses in a prime position to be leaders. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) report The Future of Nursing:Leading Change, Advancing Health (2011) contended that strong nursing leadership is critical to addressing the demands of the increasingly complex health-care system. Further, \"the nursing profession must produce leaders throughout thehealth care system, from the bedside to the boardroom, who can serve as full part-ners with other health professionals and be accountable for their own contributionsto delivering high-quality care while working collaboratively with leaders fromother health professions\" (p. 221). the evolving health-care landscape, all nurses must recognize and embrace their leadership responsibilities and understand nursing leadership competencies. All nurses, regardless of their positions, must develop leadershipskills with an emphasis on effective decision making, initiating and maintainingeffective working relationships, using respectful communication, collaboratingon interprofessional and intraprofessional teams, coordinating care effectively,and developing delegation skills and conflict resolution strategies (AmericanAssociation of Colleges of Nursing [AACN], 2008). Additionally, all nurses are managers in some way. They may be in a formal management position or managers at the bedside. Nurses in formal managementpositions are typically in a hierarchical position with subordinates. In this role, theyfocus on the following: order, consistency, and planning; organizing and budgeting,establishing and enforcing rules; and taking corrective action. The responsibilitiesof managers at the bedside include the following: managing care ac-tively participating on interprofessional and intraprofessional working skills in delegation, prioritization, andoverseeing patient care (AACN, 2008, p. 35). Leadership and management, in fact, are not interchangeable. In the best scenario, a manager is a true and effective leader; however, an excellent leader may not haveany management responsibilities within an organization. Although there are manysimilarities between leadership and management\u2014both involve the direction andinfluence of others, and both entail the accomplishing of tasks and goals of an organ-ization\u2014there are significant differences. Leadership is a process of influencing othersthrough effective relationship skills, whereas management is a formal positon withspecific functions. Ideally, a nurse can be both a leader and a manager simultaneously. This chapter is designed to assist in preparing nurses to perform as leaders by providing information on historical perspectives, current leadership theories, char-acteristics of leaders, and followership. In addition, leadership and managementcompetencies, mentoring, and self-awareness will be discussed. Knowledge, skills, and attitudes related to the following core competencies are included in this chapter: patient-centered care; and teamwork and collaboration. HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF LEADERSHIP Established in fields such as business, psychology, sociology, and anthropology,management theories were developed as a means to enhance productivity in busi-ness (Marquis & Huston 2015), with leadership theories growing from the scienceof management. Historical perspectives on leadership and management are stillrelevant today because modern theories of leadership incorporate some of the ideasfirst introduced almost a century ago. Nursing has traditionally borrowed varioustheoretical ideas from medicine, psychology, sociology, and business, with leader-ship theories developed from these various contributions. Trait Theories One early leadership theory from the 19th century was \"The Great Man Theory,\"focused on the traits of a leader and noting that certain men were born leaders46 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch03_045-060 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 46(Raelin, 2015). The focus of leadership research during this time involved the study of popularly identified great leaders. The goal was to identify what traits these in-dividuals possessed, with the aim of being able to identify new potential leadersmore quickly. Leadership Styles The next phase in the development of leadership theories (1940 to 1960) concen-trated on the identification of styles of leadership. The emphasis of study was onwhat leaders did, rather than on innate traits, and these theories were also known as behavioral theories (Raelin, 2015). These theories centered on how leaders and managers conducted themselves. Primary leadership styles were identified as autocratic (authoritarian), democratic (participative), and laissez-faire (Lewin,1951). Table 3-1 notes characteristics associated with these primary leadershipand management styles. Situational and Contingency Leadership Theories From 1950 to 1970, building on behavioral theories, researchers began to identifynew contributing factors to leadership theories. One idea that evolved at this timewas that situational factors contributed to the leadership style one embraced. Thisapproach considers that a leader may be effective in certain situations and less effective in others. Another model, contingency leadership, involved a complexprocess of evaluating a leader's style, the relationship with followers, and the taskto be completed (Fiedler, 1967). CONTEMPORARY THEORIES OF LEADERSHIP There are numerous contemporary leadership theories that grew from examiningthe multiple factors that contribute to successful leadership. Many modern theoriescontinue to include concepts developed in earlier research but have expanded toChapter 3 Theories and Principles of Nursing Leadership and Management 47 Style Autocratic Democratic Laissez-faire Table 3-1 Primary Styles of Leadership and Management Characteristics Makes decisions without input from the team Does not consider valuable suggestions from team members' input Potentially demoralizes team members Expects team members to contribute to the decision-making process Encourages team input Analyzes and makes final decisions Increases participation in projects and creative solutions Brings about higher production and satisfaction Provides advice, support, and timelines with low-level involvement Lacks focus or time management, resulting in high job satisfaction with risk of low productivity Risks the potential of team members not having the knowledge to execute the tasks May find intrateam disagreements commo n, which may produce disharmony 3021_Ch03_045-060 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 47include a multidimensional approach. In the late 20th century, leadership theorists started to notice that for leaders to be effective, the values and beliefs of the envi-ronment needed to be considered. Change cannot occur simply by a talentedleader's imposing it; rather, relationships within the organization need to be culti-vated to promote a productive and healthy environment. This marked a significantshift in leadership theories from those based on industrial models to theories thatare more relationship focused. This progression is noteworthy for nursing becauseit incorporates the multifaceted nature of health-care organizations. Nurses findthemselves being called to leadership in ever-changing, complex environmentswhere there are multiple stakeholders, increasing pressures of cost containment,and pay-for-performance initiatives. In the past, leadership theories were brokendown into two types: relational and attribution. Currently, leadership theories havebecome multifactorial. Relational Leadership Theories Relational leadership theories focus primarily on the relationship that occurs betweenthe leader and the team member. There is less emphasis on a leader's traits, the situ-ation or context, or the end result and more emphasis on the leader's relations with others. Relational theories such as quantum, transactional, transformational,and connective share the objective of optimizing the rapport among team membersand building teams. Quantum Leadership Quantum leadership draws some of its basic tenets from quantum theory in physics: The transition has begun in moving from views that are orderly and linear tothose that are holistic and relational (Porter-O'Grady, 1999, p. 38). Traditionally,leaders have looked at work activities from the basic perspective of identifyingtasks, jobs to be completed, and roles to be performed. The quantum leader looksat the system, the processes, and the relationships between workers and tasks to determine efficiency and job performance. The unpredictability of a worlddominated by chaos mandates models of leadership that incorporate flexibilityand adaptability. Quantum leadership involves the premise of an increasinglycomplex, dynamically changing health-care environment. Nurses as leaderstoday are faced with ever-increasing complexity in both job duties and techno-logical advances. Quantum leadership offers nursing a framework within whichto develop leadership skills to assist in advancing the goals of their organizations. Transactional Leadership Transactional leadership is one of the most common styles of leadership in health- care institutions. The transactional leader focuses on the goals of the organiza-tion, with a directive style establishing expectations for team members andmotivating with rewards. With this type of leadership, both the leader and the team member gain something from the interactions, although theirs is not48 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch03_045-060 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 48necessarily a shared vision. The leader is focused on getting the job done, and the team member is motivated by the reward earned. This approach limits innovation and the ability for team members to truly engage in the outcomes of their work. Given the focus of task completion, the concrete rewards that followers receive are more generally limited to a sense of a job well done (Burkeet al., 2006). Transformational Leadership As health care has evolved and increased in complexity, it has become necessaryfor leadership models to address identified aims of quality improvement, particularly in keeping with the recommended aims of the IOM: the provisionof safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable care (IOM,2001). One leadership theory that fits well with these aims is transformationalleadership. Transformational leadership involves an active involvement of both the leader and team members. It is a process in which leaders and team members \"motivateeach other to attain and achieve levels of success\" (O'Neill, 2013, p. 179). Thereis a unified investment in achieving the goals of the organization with sharedvalues. A transformational leader guides staff in creating an environment inwhich all members contribute to meeting the mission of the organization. Theleader provides a vision that has included the input of all members, thus encour-aging members to reach their highest potential and often exceed expectations.Transformational leaders transform organizations. In the process, all nurses atall levels of the organization are involved in decision making. Transformationalleaders are able to help followers grow by responding to needs, empowering in-dividuals, and aligning goals and objectives across all levels in an organization(ANA, 2013). Transformational leaders are comfortable with challenging themselves, learn from their failures, and consistently demonstrate effectiveness in organizationalchange and innovation (O'Neill, 2013). Transformational leadership is viewed asan effective type of leadership for nurses to lead the change necessary to meet thedemands of the current health-care system. This type of leadership has been iden-tified as one of the five components of the Magnet Recognition Program, discussedin Chapter 8. Connective Leadership Although transformational leadership attends to the creation of relationships byconsensus building, resolving conflict, and establishing common goals, anotherpopular theory focuses on caring. Connective leadership incorporates the needs of diverse stakeholders within the health-care environment through acknowledg-ment and use of the strengths of members and by including them in the leadershipprocess (Lipman-Blumen, 1992). Nurse leaders and managers must consider notonly whom they are guiding but where they may be leading them. Today's health- care environment demands a seamless continuity of care across multiple settings.Chapter 3 Theories and Principles of Nursing Leadership and Management 49 3021_Ch03_045-060 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 49Connective leaders identify and foster strengths of team members by including them in the processes of change within the organization (Klakovich, 1996). A suc-cessful connective leader can develop future leaders who begin contributing earlyin their career, well before undertaking a formal nursing leadership position. Attribution Leadership Theories Attribution leadership theories share the historical perspective of trait theories, byconsidering the characteristics or attributes of the leader as the cornerstone withinleadership relationships. In contrast to trait theories, attribution theories also takeinto consideration either the context or the interrelational aspects. Nurse leadersare neither born nor practicing within a vacuum. An attribution leadership theory used in nursing is authentic leadership . Leaders engaged in authentic leadership hold firmly to their values, beliefs, and principlesand inspire their followers. The determination and courage of the authentic leaderin difficult and challenging times create an environment that is predictable, efficient,and steadfast. In addition, the integrity of the leader is evidenced by a strong com-mitment to truth telling, thereby decreasing ambiguity in the system and increasingefficiency and productivity (Shirey, 2006). When leader's integrity is at a high point,a healthier work environment is achievable. The health-care environment can pres-ent challenges from multiple conflicting stakeholders with competing agendas, andthese challenges require fortitude and steadfastness from leaders. For example, fi-nancial pressures may be placed on nurse leaders and managers to adjust nursingcare to fit within specific parameters that are not in keeping with their own valuesystem (e.g., being asked to change nurse-patient ratios to unacceptable levels). Anauthentic leader will be challenged to hold steady to his or her beliefs and values. The authentic leader must embrace self-awareness and self-regulation to en- hance moral leadership (Waite, McKinney, Smith-Glasgow, & Meloy, 2014, p. 283).In moral leadership, the core ethical principles of nursing are held in highest regard.An authentic leader, while holding these principles in mind, \"develop(s) heart andcompassion by getting to know the life stories of those with whom they work andby engaging co-workers in shared meaning\" (Shirey, 2006 p. 261). The five distin-guishing characteristics of authentic leaders are purpose, heart, self-discipline, relationships, and values (p. 260). EMERGING LEADERSHIP THEORIES The newest and latest developments in nursing leadership and management in-volve aspects such as \"strategic agility\" (Shirey, 2015) and \"system leadership\"(Senge, Hamilton, & Kania, 2015). While the health-care industry is constantly un-dergoing change and being required to adapt, it is the nurse leader and manager'sresponsibility to ensure safety and quality. Nurse leaders and managers must \"incorporate strategic agility to be bold and mindful\" (Shirey, 2015, p. 305). In con-trast to the singular focus on the leader's responsibility, there is the case for systemleaders to \"develop in order to foster collective leadership\" (Senge, Hamilton, &Kania, 2015), to provide a broader perspective to solve larger problems. The current 50 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch03_045-060 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 50development of leadership theories is moving toward a more comprehensive view, incorporating flexibility and adding broader perspectives. PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCE IN NURSING LEADERSHIP According to the American Nurses Association (2015), the public has a right to expect all nurses to demonstrate competence throughout their careers. Nurses areindividually accountable for attaining and maintaining professional competence.Nurses need to develop leadership competencies that \"emphasize ethical and criticaldecision-making, initiating and maintaining effective working relationships, usingmutually respectful communication and collaboration within interprofessionalteams, care coordination, delegation, and developing conflict resolution strategies\"(AACN, 2008, p. 13). The ANA (2015) believes that competence in nursing practicecan be defined, measured, and evaluated. Further, ANA (2013) believes competencein nursing leadership can also be defined and measured. No one document or organization encompasses all required competencies for nursing leadership and management. However, many share the same themes(ANA, 2016). In Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice (2015), the ANA identifies leadership as a standard of professional performance for all nurses stating, \"theregistered nurse leads within the professional practice setting and the profession\"(p. 75). The registered nurse: Contributes to the establishment of an environment that supports and maintains respect, trust, and dignity. Encourages innovation in practice and role performance to attain personal andprofessional plans, goals, and vision. Communicates to manage change and address conflict. Mentors colleagues for the advancement of nursing practice and the professionto enhance safe, quality health care. Retains accountability for delegated nursing care. Contributes to the evolution of the profession through participation in profes-sional organizations. Influences policy to promote health. The ANA developed the Leadership Institute for all nurses with career goals of excelling in his or her role, refining leadership knowledge, skills, and attitudes, andenhancing leadership impact (ANA, 2013). The Leadership Institute identified specific leadership competencies that transcend those developed by other nursingorganizations and identify leadership competencies across the course of profes-sional development (ANA, 2013, p. 5). The competencies are organized by three domains: Leading Yourself, Leading Others, and Leading the Organization. LEADERSHIP CHARACTERISTICS It is no longer a prevailing belief that leaders are born. Leaders must constantlylearn new skills and competencies. Although certain innate qualities can make aperson a better leader, leaders today cannot rely on natural instincts alone to leadChapter 3 Theories and Principles of Nursing Leadership and Management 51 3021_Ch03_045-060 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 51successfully. Common characteristics exhibited by successful leaders are illustrated in Box 3-1. Five core characteristics common to the basis of leadership are character, com- mitment, connectedness, compassion, and confidence (Kowalski & Yoder-Wise,2004). A person's character is anchored in his or her values, based on standards established over time. A leader with character incorporates moral accountabilitywhile never losing sight of human dignity, humility, and caring. Character formsthe backbone of a leader. As an aspect of leadership, commitment encompasses a leader's ability to make a promise, keep it, and carry through with the promise. Commitment ismeasured by how well a leader can be trusted to keep his or her word. Both char-acter and commitment can really be gauged only within the context of connectedrelationships, or connectedness. The strength of the connections a leader makeslies in respect and authenticity and will determine the effectiveness of his or herleadership. Compassion is a hallmark of nursing and an essential aspect of leadership. Some nurse leaders and managers are able to recognize the individual strengths and52 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND The American Organization of Nurse Executives (AONE), a subsidiary of the American Hospital Association, was established in 1967 to \"promote nursing leadership excellence and shape public policy for health carenationwide\" (AONE, 2016, para 1). The AONE mission\u2014\"to shape the future of health care through innovativeand expert nursing leadership\"(AONE, 2016, para 2)\u2014applies to all nurses, whether the nurse functions in afrontline nurse position or as a nurse executive. The AONE has stood as a guiding light for nursing leadershipin the health-care field and has functioned as an advocate through research, education, and professional development. The AONE is committed to developing and disseminating leadership competencies for nurses at all levels of responsibility and in a variety of settings. The core competencies for leadership are organizedaccording to five distinct domains: 1) communication and relationship-building, 2) knowledge of the health-care environment, 3) leadership, 4) professionalism, and 5) business skills (AONE, 2015a). Each domain isbroken down into specific knowledge and skills that nurse leaders and managers need to develop to achievethis competency. Nurse Executive The AONE (2015a) competencies for nurse executives outline the knowledge, skills, and attitudes currentand aspiring nurse leaders and managers can use to guide practice, identify areas for growth, and plan for future careers. The competency domains and core competencies are available at http://www.aone.org/resources/nec.pdf Nurse Manager The AONE (2015b) competencies for nurse managers outline the knowledge, skills, and attitudes nurse leadersand managers need to create safe and healthy environments that support the work of the health care team andpromote optimal patient outcomes. The core competencies are organized according to the Nurse Manager Learning Domain Framework: The Science, Managing the Business; The Leader Within, Creating the Leader inYourself; and The Art, Leading the People. The competency domains and core competencies are available athttp://www.aone.org/resources/nurse-manager-competencies.pdfAmerican Organization of Nurse Executives Competencies 3021_Ch03_045-060 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 52weaknesses of team members and coordinate the most effect use of their skill set. Confidence, the sense of self-assurance without arrogance, provides nurse leadersand managers with an ability to lead through difficult times. Self-awareness , the ability to self-reflect on one's beliefs and biases and adapt be- havior accordingly, is another important characteristic of leaders. Nurse leadersand managers should do a self-assessment of their leadership and managementqualities and then have colleagues rate these same qualities. This information canprovide valuable insight. Self-assessment is often measured through emotional intelligence testing.

Emotional intelligence can be con- ceptualized generally as self-awareness and other awareness in terms of emotions, feelings, and points of view (Momeni, 2009). Nursing involves highly emotionalinteractions, whether in relation to providing care to patients or working with fellow nurses and other professionals in the health-care environment. As nursesdevelop leadership skills, conducting a critical consideration of emotional intelli-gence is useful. Self-awareness, empathy, and compassion are the cornerstones of nursing. Nurse managers and lead ers capable of handling their own emotions in tense or volatile situations display emotionally intelligent leadership. Emotionalintelligence includes five components: 1) self-awareness, 2) self-regulation, 3) motivation, 4) empathy, and 5) social skills (Goleman, 1998). Emotional intelligence develops as a person ages and can be enhanced through educational activities. Individuals with high emotional intelligence are typically LEARNING ACTIVITY 3-1Leadership Self-Assessment Visit http://hbr.org/2015/06/assessment-whats-your- leadership-style and complete a leadership style.3021_Ch03_045-060 14/01/17 3:56 PM Page 53successful and emotionally healthy (O'Neill, 2013). Emotional intelligence is believed by many to be more important than intelligence quotient (IQ) and otherpersonality or learned skills (Goleman, 1998; O'Neill, 2013). Many organizationsperform an emotional intelligence survey of their employees who demonstrateleadership ability. One example is a 360-degree survey in which an individual isassessed based on ratings from direct reports and supervisors, as well as his or herown ratings (Goleman, 1998). Nurse leaders and managers must realize that they are in charge and accountable and that their leadership style and behavior impact the overall performance of theirteam. A nurse leader and manager who perceives his or her leadership abilities inthe highest regard predictably has the lowest perception of effectiveness by others.The most self-aware, successful leaders develop techniques not only to understandtheir own emotional intelligence but also to seek a way to solicit open and honestcritique of their leadership performance. Nurse leaders and managers who havean accurate understanding of their own capabilities will have a team that can pro-vide better results. Emotionally intelligent nurse leaders have an impact on staff,peers, patient satisfaction, and organizational success. Further discoveries about self-awareness in leadership have been made specifi- cally with regard to gender differences that occur in the personal rating of self-awareness and knowledge of self (Van Velson, Taylor, & Leslie, 1993). Beliefs aboutgender differences in leadership were traditionally rooted in the stereotypical gender differences in values: women have generally been noted to value affiliation,acceptance, and dependence, whereas men have been seen as valuing competition,power, and independence. Historically, leadership theories were rooted in mascu-line value structures (Grossman & Valiga, 2009). Despite how much society hastried to move to gender neutrality in the workplace, it cannot be denied that thereis a gender bias. As a predominately female profession, nursing now includes moremen. The numbers of men entering nursing leadership roles will continue to in-crease, and this change will affect how leaders are viewed. Fortunately, currentleadership theories embrace both feminine and masculine values, which shouldlead to more successful models of leadership. FOLLOWERSHIP An integral part of leadership is the concept of followership . Where would a leader be without followers? An un-savvy leader may possibly view his or her followersas an identical, like-minded group of individuals who will blindly and without crit-icism execute the leader's objectives (Frisina, 2005); followers then become seen asa mindless herd. A Freudian approach to followership focused on the dysfunctional(disruptive) follower (e.g., impulsive, compulsive, masochistic, or withdrawn sub-ordinate) (Zaleznik, 1965). In contrast, an exemplary follower has the right to decidewhether he or she follows the leader (Kelley, 1992). Several leadership theories previously discussed address the relationship be- tween leaders and followers (team members), but with the conceptual lens that theleader bears the responsibility for the relationship. One study presented the conceptthat leadership is a co-construction of the leader and followers, and researchers54 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch03_045-060 14/01/17 3:56 PM Page 54found that \"leaders are sometimes followers, and vice versa, suggesting that follow- ing and leading are interdependent activities to be found in both groups: leadersand followers\" (Kean, Haycock-Stuart, Baggaley, & Carson, 2011, p. fall into categories of \"doing following,\" \"standing by,\" or \"resisting fol-lowing\" (Kean et al., 2011, p. 515). In essence, those in the \"doing following\" grouprepresent positive role models and potentially could be groomed for leadership.The \"standing by\" group member is someone who is participating in the group butresponds best with detailed guidance. The \"resisting following\" group memberwould appear to bring negative energy to the group dynamic. It is this last teammember who potentially distracts from the performance of the team. A leader withthe ability to assess types of followers could either provide opportunities of Chapter 3 Theories and Principles of Nursing Leadership and Management 55 Tyczkowski, B., Vandenhouten, C., Reilly, J., Bansal, G., Kubsch, S., & Jakkola, R. (2015). Emotional intelligence (EI) and nursing leadership styles among nursemanagers. Nursing Administration Quarterly, 59(2), 172-180. Aim The aim of this study is to determine the level of relationship between emotionalintelligence (EI) and leadership style among nurse managers. Methods A descriptive, exploratory study was conducted using a convenience sample ofnurse managers from six Midwestern health systems. Standardized leadership and EI questionnaires were administered. Key Findings A significant relationship was found between EI and a transformational leadershipstyle, as well as outcomes of leadership such as extra effort, effectiveness, and sat-isfaction. There was no significant relationship between the EI characteristics ofdecision making, interpersonal relations, or happiness and specific leadershipstyles. Implications for Nurse Leaders and Managers Health-care institutions strive for excellence in the provision of care, with lead-ership being a key component in reaching that goal. Acknowledging the rela-tionship between EI and leadership style allows nursing executive managementto facilitate the leadership potential of nurses earlier in their career by fosteringthe development of EI. An additional implication of this study is the importantfinding of a lack of relationship between the EI area of decision making andleadership style. Nurse leaders and managers are faced with critical decision-making tasks on a daily basis. More current leadership theories focused on the implications of relationships within health-care systems may shed light onthis area of EI.EXPLORING THE EVIDENCE 3-13021_Ch03_045-060 14/01/17 3:56 PM Page 55improvement for his or her team members or provide consequences for their actions, when appropriate. There has been much discussion of what it takes to be a good or even a great leader, but what makes a good follower? Just as the commonly held belief claimsthat good leadership can improve quality and safety, it is becoming clear that goodfollowership also affects quality and safety (Whitlock, 2013). Followers are not passive participants who go along for the ride. It is also imperative that a followerdoes not undermine the goals of a leader. This can create not only a hostile workenvironment but also an unsafe one. As with leaders, there is more known nowabout what constitutes a good follower. A good follower is a member of the teamwho contributes to the success of the organization. As with leadership skills, followership skills can be learned and developed. The good follower can interpretthe overt and subtle objectives and adjust his or her work behavior to provide thebest results for the organization's improvement of quality and safety. Followers can also be broken down into four types: 1) effective or exemplary, 2) alienated, 3) conformist, and 4) passive (Kelley, 1992, p. 97). Along with thesegeneral characteristics, the behavioral attributes of passiveness versus activenessand independent critical thinking versus dependent uncritical thinking tie intotypes of followers. For example, the effective or exemplary follower is an activeparticipant who functions independently while using critical thinking, and a pas-sive follower shows passiveness and is a dependent, uncritical thinker. No matter the type of follower, it is important to recognize the significant role that the follower plays within the organization or team. Nurses, as part of thehealth-care team, must take their position very seriously, whether it is as primaryleader or primary follower within a given time and circumstance. A good leaderrecognizes opportunities to adjust roles from leader to follower fluidly and has anunderstanding that followership enhances team functioning. Box 3-2 provides alist of characteristics that make a good follower. Leaders must always remember that followers wield tremendous influence in an organization. Effective followers engage in healthy dialogue with leaders,whereas ineffective followers dialogue in a manner that can result in unsafe or unhealthy situations, thus resulting in organizational chaos. A nurse leader andmanager can use an effective follower to better the team. For example, a savvyleader or manager will pair a new hire with a preceptor who is a part of the \"doingfollowing\" group. This ensures that the new team member will be exposed toproper policies and procedures and encourages a positive, rapid start.56 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND BOX 3-2BOX 3-2 Characteristics of a Good FollowerCharacteristics of a Good Follower Able to receive and give feedback Courageous Creative Critical thinker/knowledgeable Dependable Ethical FlexibleHumble Lifelong learner Responsible Risk-taker Thoughtful Understands he or she is an essential part of a team Visionary3021_Ch03_045-060 14/01/17 3:56 PM Page 56MENTORSHIP Across all industries, mentoring and apprenticeships have always been primary tools of training. Mentorship in nursing developed over time from the traditional apprenticeship-style approach to a less formal process in which two people engagein a relationship designed to support the growth and development of the less experienced party. As nurse leaders and managers grow and mature, mentoringrelationships will change. An understanding of the roles of mentor and mentee areimportant in leadership. A leader may at any time be both a mentor to less experi-enced nurses and a mentee in a relationship to foster his or her own growth anddevelopment. Nurse leaders and managers are charged with mentoring \"colleagues for the ad- vancement of nursing practice, the profession, and quality health care\" (ANA, 2016,p. 52). In the role of mentor, a nurse leader and manager focuses on the exchangeChapter 3 Theories and Principles of Nursing Leadership and Management 57 Kean, S., Haycock-Stuart, E., Baggaley, S., & Carson, M. (2011). Followers and the co-construction of leadership. Journal of Nursing Management, 19 , 507-516. Aim The aim of this study was to discover the perceptions of leadership by communitynurses, as well as gain an understanding of the impact of policy changes in leader-ship development. Methods This study used a qualitative research design consisting of individual interviewsand focus groups. Interview questions focused on describing leadership fornurses, the impact and outcomes of leadership, and how community nurses aresupported in developing effective leadership. In all, 39 subjects were recruitedand reflected a broad demographic of urban, rural, and mixed communities. Findings A major theme found was that the act of following is involved in the process ofleadership. A leader can move in and out of the follower role, depending on thesituation. A leader's participation may vary over time and can include \"standingby,\" \"doing following,\" or \"resisting following.\" Leadership and followership aretwo intertwined concepts that are key to successful management. Encouragingstrong followership is an important component of leadership competencies. Implications for Nurse Leaders and Managers A major consideration for nurse leaders and nurse managers is the achievement ofgoals established within their work environment. Inspirational leaders have theability to facilitate the creation of strong followers who will take the action stepsthat lead to success. Nurse leaders and managers who have the ability to recognizethe process of developing followership skills can have a positive impact on leader-ship and its resulting success. EXPLORING THE EVIDENCE 3-2 3021_Ch03_045-060 14/01/17 3:56 PM Page 57of information to assist the mentee in advancing clinical competencies, research skills, or leadership abilities, depending on the predetermined needs establishedwithin the mentoring relationship (McCloughen, O'Brien, & Jackson, 2009). Amentee seeking to advance in leadership must embrace open-minded dialogueswith other nurse leaders and managers. It is within these relationships that amentee can experience the inside view of an organization and develop a more in-depth understanding of system functioning. Nursing as a profession benefits from mentoring relationships by ensuring con- tinued growth of future nursing leaders as well as ensuring continuity of highlyskilled workers. Because the nursing workforce is aging, it is imperative that moreexperienced leaders pass on their knowledge and skills. Nurse leaders and man-agers are often in positions to function as mentors and can teach mentees the finerarts of nursing, such as interprofessional collaboration and teamwork. Mentoringbrings benefits of increased job satisfaction, higher nurse retention, and professionaladvancement (Barker, Sullivan & Emery, 2006). When nurse leaders are supportedin mentoring new nurses to create healthy work environments, some of the burdenof supervision of new nurses is lifted from the manager. SUMMARY All nurses are leaders and managers regardless of practice setting. Leaders are nei-ther strictly born nor created. Research into leadership and management theories,both historical and contemporary, offers many clues to the successful characteristicsof effective nurse leaders and managers. Health care today is constantly evolvingand requires nurses to embrace leadership roles to ensure high-quality care. Nurseleaders and managers will be challenged to stay abreast of the constantly evolvinghealth-care system while simultaneously increasing patient and staff satisfactionand quality care. Knowledge of leadership theories offers a perspective and guidefor leading and managing, and in particular, transformational leadership has beenidentified as an effective style to meet today's ever-changing health-care system.Nurse leaders and managers must develop the key leadership characteristics ofself-awareness and emotional intelligence to lead and manage today.

Understand the federal and state regulations that impact health care and nursing. Describe the five elements of malpractice. Discuss areas of potential liability related to the nurse leader and manager's role. Analyze the types of ethical and legal issues nurse leaders and managersmay face.KEY TERMS PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND Nursing care is undoubtedly intimate because interactions with patients are very intimate and occur at a time when patients are in a very vulnerable state. In turn, the career of nursing comes with myriad ethical and legal consid- erations. Establishing nurturing relationships with patients and their families isan important goal of nursing, as is delivering care without prejudice and whilerespecting human needs and values. Nurses are ethically and legally accountablefor their own actions and for the actions of those to whom they delegate care. Allnurses must practice nursing in accordance with professional codes of ethics andrecognized standards of professional practice. Nurse leaders and managers areresponsible and accountable for ensuring that staff members maintain compe-tence, provide safe and ethical care, and practice within legal and regulatoryboundaries. In today's complex health-care system, ethical and legal issues veryoften become entwined. In this chapter, nurse leaders and managers learn the ethical and legal aspects of nursing practice, including their essential roles in developing, maintaining,and/or monitoring standards, licensure, and regulation of professional nursingpractice to ensure safe care and quality outcomes. Additionally, the elements andcategories of malpractice along with common ethical and legal issues nurse leadersand managers may face are presented. Knowledge, skills, and attitudes related to the following core competencies are included in this chapter: patient-centered care; teamwork and collaboration; qualityimprovement; informatics; and safety. ETHICAL ASPECTS OF NURSING PRACTICE Respect for the individual is the ethical underpinning of nursing practice, and mostnurses use a combination of ethical morals, values, principles, theories, codes, andlaws to guide practice (Murray, 2003). Ethical nursing practice necessitates applyingmoral beliefs and making logical, consistent decisions (Burkhardt & Nathaniel,2008). Ethics in nursing requires \"the examination of all kinds of ethical and bioeth- ical issues from the perspective of nursing theory and practice, which, in turn, reston the agreed core concepts of nursing, namely: person, culture, care, health, heal-ing, environment, and nursing itself\" (Johnstone, 2009, p. 16). By applying ethics,nurses can determine the best course of action in specific situations. Ethics is an integral part of nursing practice and involves respect and advocacy for patientsand families in all settings (American Association of Colleges of Nursing [AACN],2008).Privacy ProfessionalismRespondeat superiorStandard of careTortUtilitarianismValuesValues clarificationVeracity3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 62Morals The terms morals and ethics are often, incorrectly, used interchangeably. Morals are defined as \"conduct, character, and motives involved in moral acts and include the notion of approval or disapproval of a given conduct, character, or motive that wedescribe by such words as good, desirable, right, worthy, or conversely bad, unde-sirable, wrong, evil, unworthy\" (Davis, Fowler, & Aroskar, 2010, p. 1). Morals areingrained in one's consciousness, provide people with established rules of conductbased on societal customs and habits, and reflect what is right or wrong and goodor bad. In comparison, ethics reflects what actions people should take in a specificsituation based on their own morals. Both morals and ethics are influenced by per-sonal life experiences and value systems. Nurses must maintain moral integrityand fulfill their moral obligation to patients, regardless of the setting. Moral Integrity Moral integrity refers to quality of character and involves acting consistently with per- sonal and professional values (Butts & Rich, 2013). Nurses with moral integrity arehonest and trustworthy, consistently do the right thing, and stand up for what is rightdespite the consequences (Laabs, 2011). In addition, nurses with moral integrity havea sense of self-worth because they have clearly defined values that are congruentwith their actions (Epstein & Delgado, 2010). Moral integrity is a positive attributefor nurses in leadership and management positions and is critical to ethical decisionmaking. Nurse leaders and managers with moral integrity own their own beliefs andvalues, respect the beliefs and values of others, and, despite possible differences,avoid compromising their own moral integrity. When a nurse behaves in a way thatis not congruent with professional moral beliefs, moral integrity is in jeopardy. Moral Obligation An obligation is a duty to or responsibility for another human being. Nurses enter arelationship of trust with a patient that involves a moral obligation or duty to provide care in a nondiscriminatory manner. A nurse's primary commitment is to the recipientof care (American Nurses Association [ANA], 2015a). Once a nurse-patient relation-ship has begun, a nurse has a duty to the patient and cannot abandon a patient inneed of care (ANA, 2006). At times, nurses are challenged to balance professional obligations and personal risks. Although nurses have a moral obligation to care forpatients at all times, situations may arise in which nurses could face potential personal harm. Therefore, nurses must be able to critically think and analyze certainsituations in which the risk may outweigh the moral obligation to care for a patient.In such cases, it is a nurse's decision to accept personal risk that exceeds the limits ofhis or her moral obligation. The ANA asserts that nurses are morally obligated tocare for patients when the following four criteria are present (ANA, 2006, p. 3): 1.The patient is at significant risk of harm, loss, or damage if the nurse does not assist. 2.The nurse's intervention or care is directly relevant to preventing harm.Chapter 4 Ethical and Legal Aspects 63 3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 633.The nurse's care will probably prevent harm, loss, or damage to the patient. 4.The benefit the patient will gain outweighs any harm the nurse may incur and does not present more than an acceptable risk to the nurse. If one or more of these criteria are absent, the nurse must evaluate the situation and choose whether or not to care for the patient as his or her moral obligation (ANA, 2006). However, once a nurse accepts an assignment, he or she must fulfillthe assignment or risk being charged with abandonment (Guido, 2010). Values Values are personal beliefs that influence behavior and give meaning and direction to life. Values evolve over time and reflect ethnic background, family life, culturalbeliefs, environment, and societal norms. As people mature, their value systemsmay change and grow to encompass personal, professional, and societal values.Although people are not always conscious of how much value systems influencedecision making, people are constantly making decisions based on values. \"Nurseshave a right and duty to act according to their personal and professional values\"(ANA, 2015a, p. 20). Being aware of personal values helps nurses to make clear,thoughtful, and consistent decisions. The process one goes through to understandpersonal values is called values clarification. Values Clarification Values clarification is the process of reflecting on and analyzing values to better understand what is important. Self-reflection on personal and professional valuesrequires a readiness and willingness to take an honest look at personal behaviors,words, actions, motivations, and any congruencies or incongruencies among them(Burkhardt & Nathaniel, 2008). Values clarification leads to self-awareness. Through self-reflection, nurses can develop an insight into their value systems, thus enhancing their ability to make value decisions in nursing practice (Burkhardt& Nathaniel, 2008). Values clarification is an ongoing process of becoming self-aware of the personal and professional values that are important. Nurses must become self-aware to be able to provide nonjudgmental care to patients and to de-velop and maintain a nonjudgmental approach to leadership and management.The nursing code of ethics, discussed later in this chapter, obligates nurses to de-liver care with respect for human needs and values without prejudice. It is difficultto carry out this obligation without self-awareness. Core Professional Values for Nurses Professionalism in nursing is defined as \"the consistent demonstration of core values evidenced by nurses working with other professionals to achieve optimal healthand wellness outcomes in patients, families, and communities by wisely applyingprinciples of altruism, excellence, caring, ethics, respect, communication, and ac-countability\" (AACN, 2008, p. 26). Being a professional nurse involves accountabil-ity for oneself and one's nursing practice and a duty to provide safe and qualitycare. Professional values and associated behaviors are critical to professional nursing64 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 64practice (AACN, 2008; ANA, 2015a). There are five core professional values nurses must follow (AACN, 2008, pp. 27-28): 1.Altruism: A concern for the welfare and well-being of others. In professional prac- tice, altruism is reflected by a nurse's concern and advocacy for the welfare of patients, other nurses, and other health-care providers. 2.Autonomy: The right to self-determination. Professional practice reflects auton- omy when the nurse respects a patient's right to make health-care decisions. 3.Human dignity: Respect for the inherent worth and uniqueness of individuals and populations. In professional practice, concern for human dignity is reflectedwhen the nurse values and respects all patients and colleagues. 4.Integrity: Acting in accordance with an appropriate code of ethics and accepted standards of practice. Integrity is reflected in professional practice when thenurse is honest and provides care based on an ethical framework that is acceptedwithin the profession. 5.Social justice: Acting in accordance with fair treatment regardless of economic status, race, ethnicity, age, citizenship, disability, or sexual orientation. Nurses must become self-aware and understand their personal values to better recognize situations that may result in inner conflict between personal and profes- sional values. Principles Ethical principles are basic moral truths that guide a person's actions. Valuing human dignity, respecting individuals, and believing in an individual's right to be self-governing are the foundation of ethical principles. The principles of autonomy,beneficence, nonmaleficence, justice, fidelity, veracity, privacy, and confidentialityguide everyday nursing practice, regardless of roles or settings. Table 4-1 providesa brief definition for each ethical principle. Autonomy The principle of autonomy refers to self-governance, in that an individual is free to make choices about what can be done to his or her body. An individual makesChapter 4 Ethical and Legal Aspects 65 Principle Description Autonomy Respecting a person's right to self-determination Beneficence Adhering to the duty to do good Nonmaleficence Adhering to the duty to do no harm Justice Treating others with fairness Fidelity Keeping promises Veracity Telling the truth Privacy Respecting a person's right to keep information about himself or herself from being disclosed to others Confidentiality Preventing the disclosure of a person's private information Table 4-1 Ethical Principles3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 65autonomous decisions based on his or her own values, adequate and appropriate information, and freedom from coercion. An autonomous person has the capacityto understand, reason, deliberate, manage, and independently choose a plan ofcare (Beauchamp & Childress, 2009). Nurses respect autonomy by supporting a patient's health-care choices, obtain- ing informed consent, allowing a patient to refuse treatments, and maintaining privacy and confidentiality. Nurse leaders and managers are responsible for pro-moting and protecting patient autonomy as well as professional autonomy amongstaff. Autonomy for nurses means \"determining his/her own actions through in-dependent choice, including demonstration of competence, within the full scopeof nursing practice\" (ANA, 2010, p. 39). Beneficence The principle of beneficence is a core principle of patient advocacy and refers to any action intended to benefit another\u2014in other words, one's actions should alwayspromote good. Promoting good in nursing is exemplified several ways, such as encouraging a patient to undergo painful treatment if it will increase quality andquantity of life or honoring a patient's wish to die (Guido, 2010). Some forms of beneficence are obligatory and include moral rules such as the following(Beauchamp & Childress, 2009, p. 199): 1.Protect and defend the rights of others. 2.Prevent harm from occurring to others. 3.Remove conditions that will cause harm to others. 4.Help persons with disabilities. 5.Rescue persons in danger. Nurse leaders and managers must frequently apply the principle of beneficence professionally when establishing staffing plans to ensure patient safety and avoid nurse fatigue, when conducting staff performance appraisals, and when assistingan employee in establishing a plan for professional growth. Nonmaleficence The principle of nonmaleficence refers to the moral obligation to do no harm or injury to another person. Nurses honor the principle of nonmaleficence by following stan-dards of care and implementing best practices. Nonmaleficence also involves anobligation to avoid imposing risks of harm to another and includes moral rulessuch as the following (Beauchamp & Childress, 2009, p. 153): 1.Do not kill. 2.Do not cause pain or suffering. 3.Do not incapacitate. 4.Do not cause offense. 5.Do not deprive others of goods of life.Nonmaleficence differs from beneficence in that nonmaleficence morally pro- hibits people from causing harm to anyone; beneficence is failing to help or 66 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 66benefit another, but it is not always considered immoral (Beauchamp & Childress, 2009). Some situations result in a conflict between beneficence andnonmaleficence and presenting challenges for nurses and other health-care professionals. A common example is the administration of chemotherapy.Chemotherapeutic agents destroy cancer cells but also healthy cells and haveextremely uncomfortable side effects. When providing chemotherapy, nurses violate the principle of nonmaleficence in the short term to produce a good outcome or benefit the patient in the long term. Table 4-2 presents a comparisonof the rules of beneficence and nonmaleficence. Related to the principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence is paternalism , which is \"the intentional overriding of one person's preferences or actions by another person\" (Beauchamp & Childress, 2009, p. 208) or, in the health-care world, con-trolling a patient's choices. Many nurses often justify paternalism in the name ofbeneficence and nonmaleficence. Many times a nurse, because of his or her knowl-edge, education, and experience, may believe that he or she knows what is best forthe patient and act accordingly regardless of the patient's wishes. This interfereswith the patient's autonomy and right to self-determination. Nurses must be ableto differentiate between controlling patient choices, or paternalism, and assisting patients in making informed choices, or respecting autonomy. For example, whena nurse decides not to tell a patient that his or her temperature is elevated or his orher heart rate is irregular because the nurse believes that the news will upset thepatient, that nurse is acting in a paternalistic manner. The nurse is deciding for thepatient whether he or she should be told this information. Justice The principle of justice refers to the obligation of nurses to provide fair, equitable, and appropriate treatment to all patients based on their needs and without preju-dice. Justice is about treating everyone equally and fairly and giving people whatthey deserve. Nurses apply the principle of justice when they deliver care to patients without bias. However, the principle of justice can be very complicated,especially when considering inequalities in access to health care and health insur-ance. Nurse leaders and managers apply justice professionally when they promotegiving staff members adequate compensation commensurate with education, experience, and responsibilities (ANA, 2016).Chapter 4 Ethical and Legal Aspects 67 Moral Rules of Beneficence 1.Present positive requirements for action 2.Do not need to be followed impartially 3.Generally do not provide reasons for legal punishment when rules are not followed Table 4-2 Comparison of the Moral Rules of Beneficence and Nonmaleficence From Beauchamp & Childress, 2009.Moral Rules of Nonmaleficence requirements for action 2.Must be followed impartially 3.Provide moral reasons for legal prohibitions in certain forms of conduct3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 67Fidelity The principle of fidelity refers to being faithful or loyal by keeping promises to others. Fidelity is fundamental for the nurse-patient relationship and requires nurses to be loyal, truthful, fair, and advocates for patients. When nurses receivetheir nursing license, they accept the mandate to practice nursing within establishedscope and standards of practice, which includes keeping promises to patients(Burkhardt & Nathaniel, 2008). Nurse leaders and managers apply fidelity profes-sionally when they keep promises to staff by maintaining a culture of safety and ahealthy work environment, one that is empowering and satisfying. (A healthy workenvironment is discussed further in Chapter 13.) Nurse leaders and managers mustbe mindful of the health and safety of both patients and their staff members. Veracity The principle of veracity , which is connected to autonomy and fidelity, is the notion that patients have a right to truthful information. When nurses enter the nurse-patient relationship, they must speak truthfully and not be deceptive. Overall,society trusts health-care professionals; moreover, nurses consistently rank number one by the public regarding professional honesty and ethical standards(Riffken, 2014). Nurse leaders and managers apply the principle of veracity pro-fessionally when they are truthful with employees and avoid intentionally deceiving or misleading staff. Privacy The principle of privacy refers to a person's right to have control over access to his or her personal information. Privacy is not just an ethical principle but also a legalright and is protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which is discussed later in this chapter. Patients confide in nursesand trust them with personal information. Nurses, in turn, must respect patients'privacy and discuss patient information only with other health-care professionalsand only if they have a need to know. Nurse leaders and managers promote patientprivacy when they create an environment that allows for physical and auditoryprivacy for discussion of patient information and establish policies and proceduresthat protect patient confidentiality (ANA, 2015a). Nurse leaders and managersshow respect for employee privacy by keeping an employee's religious beliefs andlifestyle choices private. Confidentiality Patients have little or no choice to share private information with nurses and othermembers of the health-care team. The principle of confidentiality means preventing disclosure of private information shared between a patient and the health-careteam. Once a patient shares personal information, the nurse can use that informa-tion only as authorized by the patient. Nurses are required to maintain confiden-tiality of all patient information.68 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 68Although confidentiality is similar to privacy, there is a difference between the two: An infringement of a person's right to confidentiality occurs only if the person (or institution) to whom the information was disclosed in confidence fails to protect the information or delib-erately discloses it to someone without first-party consent. By contrast, a person who, withoutauthorization, enters a hospital record room or computer database violates rights of privacy,although he or she may also obtain confidential information. Only the person or institutionwho obtains information in a confidential relationship can be charged with violating the rightsof confidentiality (Beauchamp & Childress, 2009, pp. 302-303). Nurses at all levels have a duty to maintain confidentiality of all patient infor- mation, both personal and clinical, in the work setting and off duty in all venues including social media or any other means of communication (ANA, 2015a, p.9).Nurse leaders and managers provide employees confidentiality by securing theirpersonal information such as Social Security numbers and medical information.Only staff members who have a legitimate need within the performance of theirjob duties should have access to employee personal information. Theories Ethical theories assist nurses in understanding the origin of ethical thinking andbehavior in the context of culture and moral norms (Burkhardt & Nathaniel, 2008).Ethical theories do not offer solutions to ethical problems; rather, they provide aguide for nurses at all levels to clarify their personal values and beliefs (Marquis &Huston, 2015). Although various ethical theories are used in nursing, many expertsconsider utilitarianism, deontology, and principlism as 2002). These three ethical theories providethe foundation for ethical decision making by nurse leaders and managers. Utilitarianism Utilitarianism is a form of teleological theory, from the Greek word telos meaning \"the end.\" The basic premise of utilitarianism is the notion that acting morally should in-crease human happiness and make the world a better place. The principle of utilityprovides the foundation of utilitarianism, which assumes it is possible to balance goodand bad. Utilitarianism is a theory of consequentialism in which the moral rightnessof an action is determined by the consequences of that action (Burkhardt & Nathaniel,2008; Volbrecht, 2002). The belief of utilitarians is that increasing happiness meansmaximizing pleasure and minimizing pain. In other words, the end justifies the means. In nursing, the utilitarian approach is used in situations in which benefits should be maximized for the good of the greatest number of people, such as the fundingof health care and the delivery of care (Black, 2014; Davis, Fowler, & Aroskar, 2010).A drawback to utilitarianism is that, although the goal is the greatest happiness forthe greatest number of people, this approach can overlook the rights of an individ-ual. Nurse leaders and managers may rely on a utilitarian approach when estab-lishing staffing schedules, when honoring time-off requests, or in times of highChapter 4 Ethical and Legal Aspects 69 3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 69census when determining whom to discharge to make room for patients requiring care that is more acute. Because the emphasis of utilitarianism is to produce thegreatest good for the greatest number of people, it is one of the most common ethical approaches used in public health nursing (Butts & Rich, 2013). Deontology Deontology comes from the Greek word deon , meaning \"that which is obligatory.\" The basic premise of deontology is that the rightness or wrongness of an actionoften depends on the nature of the act rather than the consequences of the act(Burkhardt & Nathaniel, 2008; Davis, Fowler, & Aroskar, 2010). The principle ofduty provides the foundation of deontology, which assumes a person is moralwhen he or she acts from a sense of duty. Deontology recognizes the dignity andautonomy of individuals and negates paternalism. Deontology supports the no-tions that all individuals must respect their own humanity and that a person isnever to be treated as a means to an end. In nursing, the deontological approach emphasizes truth telling, promise keeping, and being a person of good character (Murray, 2003). Deontology stresses equal treat-ment of all people, respect, freedom, and human dignity (Bandman & Bandman,2002). A drawback to the deontological approach is that it can be rigid and does notassist nurses in choosing alternatives to solve an ethical dilemma (Butts & Rich, 2013).Nurse leaders and managers may rely on a deontological approach when needingto maintain an objective approach to making hiring decisions, making daily staff assignments, and promoting the most qualified staff members. Principlism Although utilitarianism and deontology are the predominant theories used to guidenursing practice, neither approach is adequate in all ethical situations at all times. Aprinciple-based approach uses rule-based criteria for conduct that stem from the iden-tification of obligations and duties (Butts & Rich, 2013). Principles are sets of rules,ideals, standards, and values characteristic of a group (Jameton, 1984). Principlism is a theory in which one or more ethical principles are used to address an ethical issue or dilemma. For example, nurses use the principles of beneficence and nonmalefi-cence, balancing the benefit of nursing care and avoiding harm to patients, in everydaypractice. Nurse leaders and managers apply principlism when they respect the rights,responsibilities, and professional autonomy of their nursing staff members. Codes of Ethics A code of ethics is an essential requirement for any profession. It reflects the values and beliefs shared by members, informs the public of the standards of ethical conductfor the profession, and provides rules and principles for self-regulation (Bandman &Bandman, 2002; Burkhardt & Nathaniel, 2008; Guido, 2010). Codes of ethics specificto nurses include the International Council of Nurses ICN Code of Ethics for Nurses, the Canadian Nurses Association (CAN) Code of Ethics for Registered Nurses, and the70 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 70ANA Code of Ethics for Nurses With Interpretive Statements . These codes serve as ethical guides for all practicing nurses in all settings. Box 4-1 is a partial list of nurses asso- ciations worldwide with specific codes of ethics for nurses. In reviewing these codes of ethics, it is clear that globally, nursing focuses on respect for patients and their dignity and right to autonomy. Each set of codes issimilar in its focus on nursing's obligation to uphold professional standards, main-tain competence, promote patient safety, participate in ongoing lifelong learning,and collaborate with health-care team members. Nurse leaders and managers havean obligation to ensure that nursing care provided by those they supervise reflectsthe guidelines set forth in the various codes of ethics. International Council of Nurses Code of Ethics for Nurses The ICN Code of Ethics for Nurses was first adopted in 1953 and has been revised numerous times since, most recently in 2012. The purpose of the ICN Code of Ethics forNurses is to provide \"a guide for action based on social values and needs. . . . The Code must be understood, internalised, and used by nurses in all aspects of their work\"(ICN, 2012, p. 5). The ICN Code of Ethics for Nurses recognizes that the need for nursing is universal and delineates four fundamental responsibilities of nurses: \"to promoteChapter 4 Ethical and Legal Aspects 71 BOX 4-1BOX 4-1 Nurses Associations Worldwide With NursingNurses Associations Worldwide With Nursing Professional Codes of Ethics: A Partial ListProfessional Codes of Ethics: A Partial List NURSES ASSOCIATIONS American Nurses Association Australia Nursing and Midwifery Federation Canadian Nurses AssociationEuropean Nurse Directors AssociationInternational Council of NursesNursing Council of Hong Kong Nursing Council of New Zealand Nursing and Midwifery Council (United Kingdom)Philippine Nurses Association, Inc.

This code of ethics also provides four elements that outline the standards of ethical practice:nurses and people, nurses and practice, nurses and the profession, and nurses andcoworkers. It is a global document and, as such, applies to nurses from countrieswhere national nursing organizations are ICN members (Johnstone, 2009). Canadian Nurses Association Code of Ethics for Registered Nurses The CNA Code of Ethics for Registered Nurses serves as a foundation for nurses' ethical practice and provides a statement of ethical values for nurses and their commitmentto those with health-care needs and those receiving nursing care. The CNA's Code of Ethics is divided into two sections. Part one addresses the core responsibilities central to ethical nursing practice, including providing safe, compassionate, competent, andethical care; promoting health and well-being; promoting and respecting preserving dignity; maintaining privacy and confidentiality; pro-moting justice; and being accountable. Part two describes the ethical endeavors thatnurses must undertake to address and eliminate social inequities (CNA, 2008). American Nurses Association Code of Ethics for Nurses With Interpretive Statements The Nightingale Pledge, drafted in 1893 and modeled after the Hippocratic Oath,was the first code of ethics for nurses (ANA, 2015a). This pledge was revised andadopted as a \"tentative code\" and published in the American Journal of Nursing in 1940 but was never formally adopted until 1950 as the Code for Professional Nurses.It has been subsequently revised a number of times through the years: in 1956,1960, 1968, 1976 (at which time it became Code of Ethics for Nurses With Interpretive Statements ), 1985, 2001, and most recently in 2015 to reflect the influences of societal changes. The initial versions of this code of ethics reflected general attitudes to-ward nursing at the time and included values such as obedience, trustworthiness,loyalty, and adeptness in social etiquette as well as obligations to carry out physi-cians' orders (Murray, 2003). Later versions emphasized nurses' responsibility tothe patient, society, and the nursing profession. Although this code of ethics hasevolved over the past century to mirror changes in society, health care, and thenursing profession, it has consistently addressed the fundamental principles ofbeneficence, nonmaleficence, fidelity, and veracity. The Code of Ethics for Nurses establishes ethical standards for the nursing practice and provides a framework to guide nurses in ethical analysis and decision making.Its purpose is threefold (ANA, 2015a, p. viii): 1.It is a succinct statement of the ethical obligations and duties of every individual who enters the nursing profession. 2.It is the profession's nonnegotiable ethical standard. 3.It is an expression of nursing's own understanding of its commitment to society. The current Code of Ethics for Nurses includes nine provisions with related inter- pretive statements. Provisions one through three address the fundamental values and commitments of the nurse, including dignity and respect for patients; patient72 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 72rights such as self-determination, safety, privacy, and confidentiality; and acting on questionable practice. Provisions four through six describe the nurse's boundariesof duty and loyalty, such as appropriate delegation, accountability, responsibility,maintaining competence, ethical obligations, and integrity. The last three provisionsdescribe the aspects of the nurse's duties beyond individual patient encounters andinclude the nurse's role in the advancement of the profession, responsibilities to thepublic, and maintaining the integrity of the nursing profession (ANA, 2015a). Thenine provisions are presented in Box 4-2. The entire Code of Ethics With Interpretive Statements can be viewed at http://www.nursingworld.org/MainMenuCategories/ EthicsStandards/CodeofEthicsforNurses/Code-of-Ethics-For-Nurses.html. The values and obligations addressed in the ANA Code of Ethics for Nurses apply to all nurses in all roles and in all settings (ANA, 2015a). The ethical standards out-lined are nonnegotiable, and therefore all nurses are obligated to uphold and adhereto the code (ANA, 1994, 2015a). Ethical Dilemmas An ethical dilemma occurs when obligations, principles, rights, values, and beliefs are in conflict. When ethical dilemmas arise, there is not a clear-cut right or wrong solu-tion. When faced with an ethical dilemma, a nurse must make a choice between oramong two or more equally undesirable alternatives. Once a choice has been made,the nurse may continue to believe that neither choice was morally preferable. Moral uncertainty results when a nurse senses there is a moral problem but he or she is not sure of the morally correct action or what moral principles apply (Jameton, 1984).Chapter 4 Ethical and Legal Aspects 73 BOX 4-2BOX 4-2 American Nurses Association Provisions of the American Nurses Association Provisions of the Code Code of Ethics for Nurses With Interpretive Statementsof Ethics for Nurses With Interpretive Statements 1.The nurse practices with compassion and respect for the inherent dignity, worth, and unique attributesof every person. 2.The nurse's primary commitment is to the patient,whether an individual, family, group, community, orpopulation. 3.The nurse promotes, advocates for, and protectsthe rights, health, and safety of the patient. 4.The nurse has authority, accountability, and responsibility for nursing practice; makes deci-sions; and takes action consistent with the obligation to promote health and to provide optimal care. 5.The nurse owes the same duties to self as to others, including the responsibility to promotehealth and safety, preserve wholeness of characterand integrity, maintain competence, and continuepersonal and professional growth. 6.The nurse, through individual and collective effort,establishes, maintains, and improves the ethicalenvironment of the work setting and conditions ofemployment that are conducive to safe, qualityhealth care. 7.The nurse, in all roles and settings, advances theprofession through research and scholarly inquiry,professional standards development, and the generation of both nursing and health policy. 8.The nurse collaborates with other health profes-sionals and the public to protect human rights, promote health diplomacy, and reduce health disparities. 9.The profession of nursing, collectively through itsprofessional organizations, must articulate nursingvalues, maintain the integrity of the profession, andintegrate principles of social justice into nursingand health policy. From ANA, 2015a, p. v.3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 73When a nurse experiences moral uncertainty, he or she is uncomfortable about the situation but cannot explain why. Moral distress results when a nurse knows the right action to take to solve a moral problem but cannot follow his or her moral beliefs because of organizational constraints. Moral distress involves a threat to one's moral integrity (Epstein & Delgado, 2010). Factors contributing to moral distress stem from a nurse's personaltraits and experiences, the work environment, and external influences such as third-party expectations (Burston & Tuckett, 2012). Further, the research supports thatmoral distress can contribute to a decreased quality of care, patient satisfaction,and nurse satisfaction. (See Exploring the Evidence 4-1.) The American Associationof Critical-Care Nurses (2008) suggests that moral distress is a critical and fre-quently ignored problem today. It can restrict a nurse's ability to provide optimalcare and experience job satisfaction. Nurse leaders and managers must be vigilantto identify situations that may result in ethical dilemmas and be prepared to advo-cate for staff experiencing moral distress. Additionally, nurse leaders and managersmust be proactive and seek to implement programs to address moral distress andpromote creating healthy work environments. When a nurse experiences moral distress, he or she may consider speaking out. Overcoming the fear associated with speaking up takes courage, specifically moralcourage. Moral courage requires a steadfast commitment to fundamental moral prin- ciples despite potential risks (Murray, 2010). A morally courageous nurse is pre-pared to confront unethical situations despite the negative consequences, such asemotional anxiety, shame, threats to reputation, horizontal violence, and even jobloss (LaSala & Bjarnason, 2010; Murray, 2010). Examples of nurses using moralcourage include reporting a colleague who is diverting drugs, questioning a health-care provider about an order that is not within a reasonable standard of care, con-fronting a manager about inadequate staffing, and reporting a peer for postingpatient information on a social media site (Butts & Rich, 2013). Nurse leaders and managers should do their best to create and sustain work environments thatpromote moral courage. 74 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND Burston, A. S., & Tuckett, A. G. (2012). Moral distress in nursing: Contributing factors, outcomes and interventions. Nursing Ethics, 20 (3), 312-324. Aim The initial aim was to identify literature on moral distress in terms of contributingfactors, interventions, and outcomes within the aged care environment. However,because of limited findings, the researchers expanded their search to include othercare environments. Methods The investigators searched the literature published from 1980 through 2011 relatedto moral distress in following electronic databases: CINAHL, EVIDENCE 4-13021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 74Chapter 4 Ethical and Legal Aspects 75 Social Sciences Citation Index, and Arts and Humanities Citation Index. The key- words used were moral distress, moral distress scale , nursing home, and long-term care. Key Findings Three core themes emerged related to moral distress: 1) specialist critical nursing,2) specialist nursing, and 3) specialist nonnursing. The findings related to the second theme, specialist nursing, were discussed: 1. Contributing factors to moral distress originate from three primary sources: 1) the individual nurse and factors about the nurse, character traits, and personal worldview; 2) site-specific systems, including factors such asstaffing levels, staffing mix, and type of care or lack of care; and 3) externalinfluences or what researches referred to as the \"world of work,\" which describes the practice setting and can involve feelings of danger or patientand role boundary issues. 2. Outcomes describe the impact or consequences of moral distress. Outcomes are related to: 1) the nurse's personal feelings (self) and create tension be-tween what is done and what ought to be done, resulting in guilt, remorse, regret, feeling of failure, and a sense of personal grief, all of which erode thenurse's personal integrity and values; 2) the nurse's feelings toward others, including feeling powerless toward others in a given situation and possiblyputting the nurse at risk for becoming cynical, calloused, and frustrated; and3) the nurse's feelings toward the system (e.g., the nurse knowing the morallycorrect action to take but finding it impossible to pursue because of systemconstraints, leading nurses to choose to take no action at all). Consequencesrelated to the outcomes of moral distress leads to issues with quality of patient care and patient satisfaction. 3. Interventions identified as appropriate to rectify nurses' moral distress include those that focus on the individual nurse and interventions that are more collabo-rative: 1) the individual approach recommends education focused on improvedunderstanding of moral distress and development of effective coping strategies;and 2) the collaborative approach uses education and fosters participation in aninterprofessional environment where health-care professionals can develop un-derstandings of other health-care professionals and decision-making processesand can participate in forums to discuss patient goals. Implications for Nurse Leaders and Managers Nurse leaders and managers can help nurses by focusing on managing factors thatcontribute to moral distress and employ strategies to help thwart moral distressby: 1) providing an environment where nurses feel safe to discuss ethical issues,share their frustrations, and discuss situations that feel unsafe can foster support;2) assisting nurses with understanding the contributing factors and identifying thesigns of moral distress; and 3) fostering an environment that supports intraprofes-sional and interprofessional teamwork.EXPLORING THE EVIDENCE 4-1\u2014cont'd3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 75Ethical Decision Making A nurse's values and beliefs influence the way he or she approaches and solves eth- ical dilemmas. There are numerous ethical decision-making models in the nursingliterature, many of which are similar. Regardless of the framework or model, ethicaldecision making should be holistic and begin with gathering all the facts. It is crit-ical to think through the issue, feel empathetic toward all persons involved, andavoid knee jerk reactions. There are four key aspects of ethical decision making(Cooper, 2012, p. 608): 1.Identifying an ethical problem and gathering relevant facts 2.Considering all involved in terms of impact, views, and opinions 3.Identifying possible options, and choosing and justifying an option 4.Implementing the decisionThe ANA has published numerous position statements and guidelines to assist nurses dealing with ethical decisions in everyday practice. Box 4-3 provides a list of relevant position statements that can aid in ethical decision making. Nurses atall levels often encounter situations in practice that require them to make decisionsin collaboration with others involved in the situation, such as patients, families,other nurses, and other health-care professionals. Ethics Committees In the early 1990s, The Joint Commission (TJC) recognized the need for a mecha-nism to address ethical issues in health-care organizations and established a stan-dard for accreditation. Since then, health-care organizations seeking accreditationor maintaining accreditation must address ethical issues through an ethics 76 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND BOX 4-3BOX 4-3 American Nurses Association Position StatementsAmerican Nurses Association Position Statements Related to Ethics and Human RightsRelated to Ethics and Human Rights Addressing Nurse Fatigue to Promote Safety and Health: Joint Responsibilities of Registered Nursesand Employers to Reduce Risks Cultural Diversity in Nursing Practice Constituent/State Nurses Associations (C/SNAs) asEthics Resources, Educators, and Advocates Discrimination and Racism in Health Care Euthanasia, Assisted Suicide, and Aid in Dying Forgoing Nutrition and Hydration In Support of Patients' Safe Access to TherapeuticMarijuana Nonpunitive Alcohol and Drug Treatment for Preg-nant and Breastfeeding Women and Their ExposedChildrenNurses' Role in Capital Punishment Nursing Care and Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) andAllow Natural Death (AND) Decisions Privacy and Confidentiality Reduction of Patient Restraint and Seclusion inHealth-Care Settings Registered Nurses' Roles and Responsibilities inProviding Expert Care and Counseling at the End of Life Risk and Responsibility in Providing Nursing Care Stem Cell Research From ANA.

Typically, interprofessional committees or teams provide ethics consultation services when ethical dilemmas arise during the delivery of care. Ethics committees in organizations have three interrelated functions: 1) institu- tional policy review and development, 2) ethics education, and 3) case consultation(Lachman, 2010). Most ethics committees are responsible for developing and review-ing policies and procedures, such as those relating to informed consent, advance directives, and withholding or withdrawing life support measures. Ethics educationis an ongoing process among committee members and throughout an organization.Education for committee members is accomplished through invitation of expertguest speakers, sharing of article and case reviews, and sharing of knowledge byother members that was gleaned from ethics workshops/conferences (Lachman,2010). Organization-wide education occurs through ethics workshops and confer-ences. The nature of ethics committees is interprofessional; nurse leaders and managers frequently participate on ethics committees. A common service provided by an ethics committee is consultation to address ethical issues related to current clinical situations. The goals of consultation in-clude intervening to protect patient rights, making recommendations to resolveethical conflicts, providing moral support for those involved in an ethical situa-tion, and reducing the risk of legal liability. The bedside nurse, health-careprovider, family member, health-care surrogate, or patient can request an ethicsconsultation. In fact, anyone can refer a situation to the ethics committee for review. As part of patient-centered care, nurses must understand that conflict canarise between the patient's wishes and professional care. In some cases, request-ing an ethics consultation can require a nurse to be morally courageous. Nurseleaders and managers must empower patients and nurses to foster a patient-centered approach to ethical decision making. LEGAL ASPECTS OF NURSING PRACTICE Nurses at all levels must engage in responsible and accountable nursing practice.Further, nurses have authority, accountability, and responsibility to make decisions that result in safe, quality, and evidence-based nursing practice (ANA,2015a, 2015b). Accountability is \"to be answerable to oneself and others for one's own choices, decisions and actions as measured against a standard\" (ANA,2015a, p. 41), such as those established by the ANA Code of Ethics for Nurses WithInterpretive Standards , the ANA Nursing Scope and Standards of Practice , and state nurse practice acts (ANA, 2015a, 2015b). To be accountable, nurses at all levelsmust embrace an approach to nursing practice that includes application of ethical principles; respect for the dignity, worth, and autonomy of patients; adherence to the scope and standards of nursing practice and legal and regula-tory agencies; and fulfillment of society's need for conscientious and qualifiednurses (ANA, 2010, 2015b). Nurse leaders and managers must have a complete understanding of the mini- mum standards of clinical practice, the requirements of licensure, regulations thatimpact nursing, federal and/or state legislation in place to protect both health-careChapter 4 Ethical and Legal Aspects 77 3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 77workers and their patients, classifications of law that relate to nursing practice, and malpractice. Additionally, nurse leaders and managers are responsible and account-able for ensuring their nursing staff members have the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to perform their professional responsibilities. Standards for Clinical Practice All nurses must be aware of the minimum standards of care for nursing practice.There are four foundational resources that provide registered nurses in theUnited States with the critical knowledge needed to inform clinical decisionmaking and guide professional nursing practice. First is the nurse practice act of the state in which a nurse practices, discussed in greater detail in the nextsection, \"Licensure and Regulation of Nursing Practice.\" Second is the ANA Code of Ethics for Nurses With Interpretive Statement (2015a), which is discussed earlier in the chapter and details the ethical standards for nurses in all roles and in allsettings. The last two resources are Nursing's Social Policy Statement: The Essenceof the Profession (ANA, 2010), which describes nursing's commitment to society and provides a definition of nursing, and Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice (ANA, 2015b), which presents the standards of professional nursing practice andaccompanying competencies. Nursing's Social Policy Statement: The Essence of the Profession Nursing's Social Policy Statement: The Essence of the Profession defines nursing as \"the protection, promotion, and optimization of health and abilities, prevention of illnessand injury, alleviation of suffering through the diagnosis and treatment of humanresponse, and advocacy in the care of individuals, families, communities, and pop-ulations\" (ANA, 2010, p. 10). Further, it describes the role of professional nursingin society and health care and provides an overview of the essence of nursing prac-tice. The profession of nursing has a contract with society that grants the professionauthority and reflects nursing's core values and strong code of ethics. This socialcontract identifies the profession's active leadership role related to the followingsix social concerns (ANA, 2010, p. 4-5): 1.Organization, delivery, and financing of quality health care 2. Provision for the public's health 3.Expansion of nursing and health-care knowledge and appropriate applicationof technology 4.Expansion of health-care resources and health policy 5.Definitive planning for health policy and regulation 6.Duties under extreme conditions Nurse leaders and managers can use Nursing's Social Policy Statement as a foun- dational resource to reinforce with nursing staff on a regular basis the concepts of autonomy and competence, the scope and standards of nursing practice, and thenursing process. In addition, this resource can provide a basis for developing a unitvision, mission, and philosophy, as well as strategic planning. 78 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 78Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice To provide a complete picture of the dynamic and complex nature of nursing practice, the \"who, what, when, where, why, and how\" of nursing practice mustbe detailed (ANA, 2015b). Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice answers each of these questions and \"describes a competent level of nursing practice and professional performance common to all registered nurses\" (ANA, 2015b, p. 1).This document delineates the professional scope and standards of practice andresponsibilities of all registered nurses in all settings and serves as a basis for the following (ANA, 2015b, pp. 49-50): Quality improvement systems Health-care reimbursement and financing methodologies Development and evaluation of nursing service delivery systems and organiza-tional structures Certification activities Position descriptions and performance appraisals Agency policies, procedures, and protocols Educational offerings Regulatory systems Establishing the legal standard of care Nurse leaders and managers rely on the Scope and Standards of Practice to ensure that staff members provide safe and competent care. Licensure and Regulation of Nursing Practice Health care in the United States is a highly regulated industry. Nursing care canpose a risk of harm to the public if practiced by professionals who are unpreparedor incompetent. Federal and state governments have a responsibility to protectthose receiving health care through licensure of individuals and regulation ofhealth-care organizations. Licensure Licensure is the process by which boards of nursing grant permission to an individual to engage in nursing practice after determining that the applicant has the necessarycompetencies (National Council of State Boards of Nursing [NCSBN], 2014a). In theUnited States and Canada, nursing licensure is mandatory. In the United States, thebasic requirements for a nursing license are graduating from an approved nursingprogram and successfully passing the National Council Licensing Examination forRegistered Nurses (NCLEX-RN), developed by the NCSBN. Nursing licensure as-sures the public that those calling themselves nurses have met regulatory standardsspecific to the nursing profession. Licensure is a way to hold nurses who violatenurse practice acts and standards of practice accountable for their actions and en-sures that foreign-educated nurses have met U.S. standards (NCSBN, 2011a). Nurseleaders and managers must verify and monitor licensure of all nursing staff.Chapter 4 Ethical and Legal Aspects 79 3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 79Regulation The nursing profession ensures that members act in the public's best interest when providing nursing care through professional regulation, self-regulation, and legalregulation (ANA, 2010). Professional regulation consists of the oversight, monitor-ing, and controlling of members based on principles, guidelines, and rules deemedstandard in the profession. Self-regulation is personal accountability for one's professional nursing practice based on those same principles, guidelines, and rules;nurses regulate their own practice by maintaining current knowledge, skills, andattitudes through academic and continuing education. Legal regulation consists ofoversight and monitoring based on applicable statutes and regulations such as licensure, nurse practice acts, civil law, and criminal law (ANA, 2010). Federal andstate regulations are overseen by administrative agencies; two of the most impor-tant are the NCSBN and the state boards of nursing. State Nurse Practice Acts All states and territories of the United States have enacted a nurse practice act (NPA)through state legislature. Each NPA establishes a board of nursing that has the authority to develop rules and regulations to clarify the law. The rules and regulationsmust be consistent with the NPA and undergo a process of public review before enacted (NCSBN, 2014b). All NPAs include the following (NCSBN, 2014b, para. 5): Authority, power, and composite of a state board of nursing Education program standards Requirements for licensure Types of titles and licenses Scope and standards of nursing practice Grounds for disciplinary action, other violations, and possible remedies Nurses are accountable for the rules and regulations that govern nursing practice in any state in which they work. Therefore, it is nurses' responsibility to ensure theyhave a good understanding of their state's NPA. Nurse leaders and managers havea responsibility to ensure that nursing staff members comply with the state NPA. 80 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND LEARNING ACTIVITY 4-1 Check Your State Nurse Practice Act Visit your state's board of nursing Web site, and review your state's nurse practice act. 1. Can you identify the key elements recommended by the NCSBN? 2. How does it reflect the ANA Nursing Scope and Standards of Practice? National Council of State Boards of Nursing Besides developing the NCLEX-RN, the NCSBN is responsible for promoting uni- formity of nursing regulation. The NCSBN is a not-for-profit organization whosemembership consists of a board of nursing members from the United States, theDistrict of Columbia, and the U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam, Northern3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 80Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. The purpose of the NCSBN is to provide an organization through which state boards of nursing collaborate onnursing regulations to promote public health, safety, and welfare (NCSBN, 2014a).The NCSBN also maintains a national database on disciplinary action taken againstnurses, the National Practitioner Data Bank. Important information about NCSBN,licensure, and the NCLEX-RN can be found at www.ncsbn.org. State Boards of Nursing State boards of nursing protect the public by enforcing the NPA to promote safe,competent nursing care. The role of the state board of nursing varies by state buttypically includes the following (NCSBN, 2011a): Enforcing the state's NPA and nurse licensure Accrediting or approving nursing education programs Developing practice standards, policies, and administrative rules and regulations Addressing violations of the NPA Unsafe or incompetent nursing practice should be reported to the state board of nursing. Violations of the NPA or unsafe nursing practice is taken seriously. The state board of nursing reviews each case to determine whether misconduct or unsafe practice has occurred and what actions should be taken. Examples of serious reportable behaviors that violate the NPA include the following (NCSBN,2011b, p. 3): Being impaired by drugs or alcohol while working Stealing from a patient Practicing out of the scope of practice, such as providing treatment that shouldbe provided only by a physician or advanced practice registered nurse Falsifying records Physically or sexually abusing a patient Participating in criminal conduct Nurse leaders and managers are responsible for understanding the state board of nursing regulations and the state NPA. Federal and/or State Legislation Many federal and state laws have been implemented to improve health care and,in turn, affect nursing practice. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act The HIPAA was enacted in 1996 to improve portability and continuity of healthinsurance coverage; combat waste, fraud, and abuse in health insurance andhealth-care delivery; promote the use of medical savings accounts; improve accessto long-term care coverage and services; simplify the administration of health insurance; and protect individuals from wrongful disclosure of identifiable healthinformation (HIPAA, 1996). The privacy regulations extend coverage to all forms of personal records, require consent for routine use and disclosure of health records, protect against unauthorizedChapter 4 Ethical and Legal Aspects 81 3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 81use of medical records for employment purposes, and ensure that health-care providers have necessary information to treat their patients. The privacy and confidentiality regulations went into effect in 2003, with the primary purpose to improve efficiency and effectiveness of health-care systems by standardizing the elec-tronic exchange of administrative and financial data (United States Department ofHealth and Human Services [USDHHS], 2003). The privacy rule protects all identifiable health information or protected health information (PHI). PHI includes information that relates to an individual's past,present, or future physical or mental health or condition; the provision of healthcare to the individual; or the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to the individual (USDHHS, 2015, pp. 1-2). Common examples ofPHI are patient identifiers such as name, address, Social Security number, birth-date, gender, insurance company name, and medical diagnosis. (Basic informationfor health-care providers is available at https://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNProducts/Downloads/HIPAAPrivacyandSecurity.pdf. A HIPAA violation occurs when PHI is inappro-priately used or is disclosed to a person not involved in the patient's care, to a person who does not require the information to provide care, or in a situation inwhich disclosure is not in the patient's best interest (McGowan, 2012). Violationsof HIPAA can result in substantial fines and prison sentences. Patient Self-Determination Act Congress passed the Patient Self-Determination Act (PSDA) in 1990 to ensure thathealth-care organizations inform patients about their rights and institutional poli-cies to accept or refuse treatment and to prepare advance directives (Beauchamp& Childress, 2009). The basic premise of the PSDA is to promote patients as activeparticipants in health-care decisions, thus increasing patient autonomy. The PSDArequires hospitals and other health-care agencies serving Medicare and Medicaidpatients to develop and maintain written policies and procedures and to providewritten information to adults receiving health care. Materials must describe the following: The individual's right under the law to make decisions about medical care, including the right to accept or refuse medical and surgical treatment The individual's right under state law to dictate advance directives such as livingwills or durable power of attorney for health care. The policies and procedures that the institution has developed to honor theserights. Institutions must specify how the advance directives are to be identified,recorded, and retrieved when needed. The legislation requires institutions to provide educational programs on advance directives for their staff and communities. The PDSA prohibits staff from condi-tioning the provision of care or discriminating against individuals in other waysbecause they do or do not have advance directives. Hospitals and nursing homesmust provide all newly admitted patients with written information detailing thesepolicies and procedures, and home health and hospice agencies must provide in-formation when the individual begins to receive care from the agency (PSDA, 1990).82 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 82Safe Medical Devices Act The Safe Medical Devices Act (SMDA) was enacted in 1990 to require health-care agencies to report to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) serious injuries, illness, or death resulting from the use of a medical device (SMDA, 1990). A medicaldevice is any medical product that is not absorbed in the body. When a serious in-jury, illness, or death occurs, the SMDA requires health-care agencies to report tothe FDA within 10 days of the event the following information: name, serial number,and model of the device; name and address of the manufacturer; and a brief descrip-tion of the event. A nurse's responsibility related to an incident involving a medicaldevice covered under the SMDA includes the following (Brent, 2001): Discontinue the use of the device immediately. Follow your agency's policies related to equipment use. Document the incident accurately in the medical record, on an incident report,and on any agency-specific forms. Record the identification number of the device in the medical record and otherforms on a regular basis. Nurse leaders and managers are responsible for making certain that policies and procedures related to equipment use are in place. Further, should equipmentmalfunction, nurse leaders and managers must facilitate processes to sequester theequipment to ensure patient safety. Good Samaritan Laws All states have enacted Good Samaritan laws to encourage health-care professionalsto render care in emergencies. Good Samaritan laws protect anyone who renderscare during an emergency or disaster or at the scene of an accident as long as careis provided at the scene of the emergency, care is not grossly negligent, appropriatestandards of care are used, and care is rendered without pay (Aiken, 2004). GoodSamaritan protection is necessary because, although many may feel a moral duty,health-care professionals are not legally obligated to render care to a stranger in anemergency. Good Samaritan laws vary from state to state, so nurses must becomefamiliar with the law in their state. Disclosure Statutes Federal and state laws require disclosure of health-related information to appropriategovernment agencies to protect the public (Guido, 2010). Nurses as well as otherhealth-care professionals must report suspected child neglect and suspected childabuse to the state-designated officials. Health-care providers are protected from lia-bility if they report suspected child abuse or neglect in good faith but an investigationdetermines the report is groundless (Guido, 2010). Conversely, failure to report suspected child abuse or neglect could result in liability. Some states also requiremandatory reporting of suspected abuse of dependent adults and older adults.Nurses should check their state laws to know the mandatory disclosure requirements. Additionally, some communicable diseases and sexually transmitted diseases must be reported to local or state public health officials. Health-care workers shouldChapter 4 Ethical and Legal Aspects 83 3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 83follow their agency's policies and reporting procedures. In a community setting, it is critical that information is reported to the proper agency. A list of reportable dis-eases is updated annually and is available through the Centers for Disease ControlNational Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System at wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss. Employment Laws Federal and state governments are responsible to enact laws that protect employeesfrom unfair treatment, discrimination, and unsafe work conditions. Because nursesmake up the largest labor force in the health-care industry, nurse leaders and man-agers must keep up to date concerning the laws and regulations that are aimed at protecting the nursing workforce. Table 4-3 is a summary of important federalemployment laws of which nurse leaders and managers must be aware. 84 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND Federal Legislation Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) of 1967, P .L. 90-202Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990,P .L. 101-336; Amendments Act, 2008, P .L. 110-325 Civil Rights Act of 1964, 1991 P .L. 82-352 Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) of 1985, P .L. 99-272 Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) of 1986, 2003, P .L. 95-452 Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993, P .L. 103-3 False Claims Amendments Act of 1986, P .L. 99-562 Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, P .L. 91-595 Table 4-3 Common Federal Employment Legislation Nurse Managers and Leaders Must Know Protection Prohibits discrimination against a person 40 years or older when forming an employment relationship or promotionProhibits discrimination against a person with mental or physicalimpairment in the workplace and requires the employer to makereasonable accommodations to allow employees to perform essential job functions Prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, national origin, orlineage when forming an employment relationship; amended in 1991 to define sexual harassment and the employer's re-sponsibility related to itEnsures employees and their families have health-care coveragefor a specified time after employment is terminated, hours arereduced, or an employee becomes eligible for MedicareEstablishes a right of access to emergency medical care regard-less of a person's citizenship, age, or ability to pay; amended in 2003 to expand the definition of an emergency patient to in-clude persons a reasonably prudent person would believe hadan emergency medical condition and to include the rule that if a person refuses medical treatment, every effort must be madeto obtain the refusal in writingMaintains job protection for an individual for up to 12 weeks ofunpaid leave per year for an employee to care for an ill familymember, after adoption, or for his or her own healthAlso called the \"Whistleblower Law,\" protects employees fromretaliation and threats against discharge when the employee, ingood faith, reports a violation of federal or state laws or rulesEnsures safe and healthy work conditions for employees andprotects employees from workplace hazards such as blood andbody fluid exposure, hazardous materials, and fires3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 84Classifications of Law That Relate to Nursing Practice In the United States, the major classifications of law that apply to nursing practice are contract law, criminal law, and civil law. A voluntary agreement between or among two or more competent people is the basis for contract law . The contract creates an obligation for a person to do or not to do something and creates enforceable rights or legal duties (e.g., an employer-employee agreement) (Brent, 2001). Criminal law relates to conduct that is harmful to society as a whole as well as to an individual victim. Crimes are classified as either a misdemeanor, which is punishableby fines or imprisonment for less than 1 year, or a felony, a more serious offense pun-ishable by imprisonment for more than 1 year or death. Examples of misdemeanorsin health care include a nurse failing to report suspected child abuse or dependentadult abuse (Allen, 2013) or an individual using the title \"nurse\" or \"registered nurse\"without being duly licensed or certified. Examples of felonies in health care includesome HIPAA violations and diversion of controlled substances from a health-care facility. In addition, some violations of the state NPA can be charged as a felony (e.g., using or attempting to use a nursing license that has been suspended or revoked). Civil law pertains to the rights and duties of private citizens and is enforced through the courts as damages or monetary compensation. Tort law is the foun-dation of civil law and is the most common type of law that affects health-careprofessionals (Guido, 2010). A tort is a civil wrong committed against another person or a person's property and includes personal injury inflicted on anotherthrough actions of commission or omission. The law allows the injured person toseek monetary compensation for injuries at the expense of the wrongdoer (Brent,2001). The three types of torts are as follows: 1.Intentional torts: Willful acts that are intentional and cause injury. An intentional tort is a direct violation of a person's legal rights and includes assault, battery, false imprisonment, and fraud. 2.Quasi-intentional torts: Willful acts that cause injury but are unintentional torts. A quasi-intentional tort typically involves communication issues that result indefamation of character, violation of personal privacy, or breach of confidential-ity (Aiken, 2004). 3.Unintentional torts: Careless acts or accidents that cause injury. Negligence and malpractice are examples of unintentional torts. Table 4-4 summarizes the three types of torts as they relate to nursing practice. Negligence and Malpractice As just mentioned, torts are the most frequent causes of legal action taken against health-care professionals, and, of those, the unintentional torts of negligence andmalpractice are the most common. Negligence is a deviation from the standard behavior or actions that an average, prudent person would use in a similar situa-tion. Although often used interchangeably with negligence , malpractice is a more specific term and addresses a professional standard of care. Malpractice, alsoknown as professional negligence , is a deviation from the standard of care that a Chapter 4 Ethical and Legal Aspects 85 3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 85reasonably prudent health-care professional would use in a similar situation. In other words, when a nurse is charged with professional negligence, the nurse's ac-tion or lack of action is compared with what another ordinary, reasonable, and pru-dent nurse would do under the same or similar circumstances. Elements of Malpractice Five essential elements must be present for malpractice to be charged (Reisling,2012): 1.Duty owed the patient 2.Breach of the duty owed the patient 3.Foreseeability of harm 4.Causation 5.Injury or harm 86 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND Torts Intentional Torts Assault BatteryFalse imprisonmentFraud Quasi-intentional Torts Defamation of character Violation of privacy Breach of confidentiality Unintentional Torts Negligence Malpractice (professional negligence) Table 4-4 Three Types of Torts and How They Relate to Nursing Practice Examples in Nursing Practice Threatening to restrain a patient if he or she gets out of bedHolding down a patient to insert a catheteragainst the patient's wishesRestraining a competent patient againsthis or her wishesBilling a patient for services not rendered Charting that a patient is acting crazy (libel); telling another nurse you think apatient is crazy (slander)Looking up your neighbor's blood work on the hospital computer systemPosting information about a patient's medical status on Facebook Failure to assess a patient's IV site according to standard of care Failure to prevent injury to a patient because the IV became infiltratedDescription Intentionally threatening a patient with physical harm Physically harming a patient Intentional confinement of a patientIntentional misrepresentation thatresults in an illegal benefit to self or others Intentional written defamation (libel) or oral defamation (slander) of apatientIntentional intrusion into a patient'sprivacyIntentional sharing of a patient'sprivate health-care information heor she has shared with you Failing to perform an action that a reasonably prudent nurse would doin a similar situationUnintentional injury to a patient asthe result of a breach of duty3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 86If one of these elements is missing, the malpractice claim will not be successful. Duty Owed the Patient The basis of the duty owed is the nurse-patient relationship, which implies that the patient is dependent on the nurse for safe and quality nursing care. Nursesare obligated to deliver care according to established standards based on thenursing process and that represent the minimum requirement for acceptablenursing practice. For example, a standard of care related to medication adminis- tration is to check the patient's medical record for allergies. When administeringmedications to patients, nurses have a duty to follow this standard and alwayscheck for allergies. Breach of the Duty Owed the Patient Nurses must deliver care according to a standard of care that a reasonably prudentnurse under similar circumstances would use. A breach of duty results when care is less than the standard. Using the previous scenario, if a patient is allergic topenicillin and a nurse did not check the patient's medical record for allergies beforeadministering penicillin, the nurse breached the standard of care and thus the dutyowed to the patient. Foreseeability of Harm Certain actions can be expected to have specific consequences. A nurse must haveknowledge about the standard of care and understand that failure to meet the stan-dard may result in harm or injury. For example, all nurses learn safe medicationadministration in foundational nursing courses. All nurses know that neglectingto check the medical record for allergies before administering a medication couldresult in harm to a patient. Causation Any injury that occurs is directly a result of the breach of duty owed to the patient.In other words, the failure to meet the standard of care by action or lack of actioncaused harm or injury to the patient. If the patient in the scenario develops an allergic reaction after the nurse administers the penicillin, there is a cause-and-effectrelationship between failure to check allergies on the medical record and the resultant allergic reaction. Injury or Harm Some type of physical injury must result from the breach of duty. Administrationby the nurse of penicillin to the patient who is allergic could have several sequelae: 1.Nothing happens, and therefore the five elements of malpractice are not present. 2.The patient develops a mild allergic reaction that is not severe and recovers with-out incident. Again, the five elements of malpractice are not present. 3.The patient develops anaphylactic shock and dies.

Lisa observes Bethany stick herself with the sterile IV catheter, thus contaminating the IV catheter. Lisa mentions her observation to Bethany and offers to get another IV catheter. Bethany says, \"It's nobig deal,\" and inserts the IV catheter anyway. 1. What provision(s) in the ANA Code of Ethics With Interpretive Statements could apply to this situation? 2. How should Lisa advocate for the patient? 3. Are the elements of malpractice present in this situation?4. Who is at fault if the patient develops an infection at the IV site?5. What actions should the nurse leader and manager take in this situation? Major Categories of Malpractice Malpractice suits against nurses have increased since 2000 (Reisling, 2012). Research indicates that six common categories of nursing practice have the potential for negligence and possible malpractice (Croke, 2003): 1.Failure to assess and monitor 2.Failure to follow standards of care 3.Failure to communicate 4.Failure to document 5.Failure to act as a patient advocate 6.Failure to use equipment in a responsible manner (See Exploring the Evidence 4-2.) Failing to perform these actions can constitute negligence if the required elements are present. Failure to Assess and Monitor The ANA resource, Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice , describes a competent level of nursing practice and professional performance common to all registered nurses in all settings regardless of role\u2014in other words, the minimum requirementfor acceptable nursing practice. According to these standards, \"The registered nursecollects pertinent data and information relative to the health-care consumer's healthor situation\" (ANA, 2015b, p. 53). Nurses must be accurate in assessing, monitoring,and reporting changes in health status. Failure to complete a shift assessment, implement a plan of care, observe a patient's progress, or accurately interpret a patient's signs and symptoms can be considered negligence. Failure to Follow Standards of Care The ANA standards are \"authoritative statements of the duties that all registerednurses, regardless of role, population, or specialty are expected to perform competently\" (ANA, 2015b, p. 51). Nurses must be knowledgeable about their state's NPA and standards of care, hospital policies and procedures, and3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 88Chapter 4 Ethical and Legal Aspects 89 Croke, E. M. (2003). Nurses, negligence, and malpractice: An analysis based on more than 250 cases against nurses. American Journal of Nursing, 103 (9), 54-63. Aim This article aimed to identify the actions and issues that led to charges of profes-sional negligence against nurses and to identify areas of nursing practice most frequently cited. Methods A total of 253 cases that involved charges of negligence and malpractice againstnurses from 1998 through 2001 were analyzed to identify the actions that promptedthe legal charges and the areas of nursing practice most frequently identified in thecomplaints. Key Findings The six areas of negligence that most frequently resulted in professional negligencewere as follows: 1. Failure to assess and monitor 2. Failure to follow standards of care3. Failure to communicate4. Failure to document5. Failure to act as a patient advocate6. Failure to use equipment in a responsible manner Implications for Nurse Leaders and Managers Nurse leaders and managers must ensure that they as well as their staff are aware ofcurrent standards of practice, rules and regulation, ethical guidelines, and organiza-tional policies and procedures. In addition, they must ensure that nurses providesafe competent care that follows the nursing process. Nurse leaders and managersmust promote effective intraprofessional and interprofessional communication,which includes accurate documentation of nursing care. Finally, nurse leaders andmanagers are responsible to verify that staff members are properly educated andcompetent to use all equipment in a responsible manner.EXPLORING THE EVIDENCE 4-2institution's standardized protocols. Failure to follow standards of care or hospital policies can be considered negligence. Violating the state NPA can alsohave legal implications. Failure to Communicate According to the ANA (2015b) standards, \"The registered nurse communicates effectively in all areas of practice\" (p. 71). Nurses must communicate effectivelythe nature and degree of any changes in a patient's progress. Failure to listen to a patient and act on his or her concerns or failure to ensure effective teaching ofself-care or discharge instructions to a patient can be considered negligence.3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 89Failure to Document Documentation is a critical competency for quality and safe nursing practice and is related to all ANA standards of practice (ANA, 2015b). Documentation must accu-rately reflect the nursing process. Failure to document pertinent assessment informa-tion or a patient's response to nursing interventions can be considered negligence. Failure to Act as a Patient Advocate Advocacy is a fundamental aspect of professional nursing practice and is relatedto all ANA standards of practice (ANA, 2015b). Nurses at all levels are patient advocates, and as such they must support and promote patient rights. Failure toact on incompetent practice, question illegible medical orders, or provide a safe en-vironment for patients can be considered negligence. Similarly, the nurse leadersand managers must support and promote nurses' rights. Failure to advocate fortheir staff members to ensure they have adequate resources, a culture of safety, anda healthy workplace to provide safe and quality care can be considered negligence. Failure to Use Equipment in a Responsible Manner Patient safety is a priority in health care today. Nurses are responsible for coordi-nating and implementing plans of care in accordance with patient safety goals.Nurses must know how equipment functions, follow manufacturer's guidelinesfor operation, check the equipment for safety before use, and place equipment prop-erly during treatment. There is no substitute for nursing knowledge and skill.Therefore, nurses remain \"accountable for their practice even in instances of systemof equipment technology failures\" (ANA, 2015a, p.16). Failure to handle equipmentin a safe manner can be considered negligence. Expert Witnesses In nursing negligence cases, the federal court and all state courts in the UnitedStates require expert nurse witnesses designated by the prosecution and the defenseto establish the standard of care (Myers & Boutier, 2011). The role of the nurse expertwitness is to help educate the jury regarding the nurse's actions in the particularcase and the applicable standard of care (Brent, 2001). Three factors are critical toselecting the best nurse expert witness: The nurse expert must have the necessaryqualifications, must have experience testifying in the role, and must be able to testify accurately and with confidence. Liability In the case of nursing negligence, liability refers to the nurse's responsibility for a possible or actual loss, penalty, burden, or expense that the law requires the nurseto compensate the victim (Brent, 2001). Personal liability defines a nurse's account-ability for professional actions to patients and families, peers, themselves, and ultimately, society (ANA, 2010). In other words, a nurse is accountable for his orher behavior including negligent behavior. The doctrine of respondeat superior , Latin for \"let the master answer,\" holds employ- ers accountable for the negligent actions of their employees, or vicarious liability90 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 90Chapter 4 Ethical and Legal Aspects 91 Advocacy is briefly discussed in Chapter 1 as one of the philosophical underpinnings of nursing. Nursing advocacy encompasses caring, respect for an individual's autonomy, and empowerment. Nurse leaders andmanagers advocate for patients and families, staff, the profession, and themselves on a daily basis. Advocating for Patients and FamiliesThe role of an advocate is to safeguard patients and their families against abuse, unsafe practice, and violationsof their rights (Bandman & Bandman, 2002). Nurses have more contact with patients and their families than any other health-care professional and often develop an understanding of the values, desires, and needs of patientsand their families. Therefore, nurses are in the best position to protect those interests (Bandman & Bandman,2002). To provide patient-centered care, nurses must advocate for patients and their families on an ongoing basis, even if they disagree with a patient's decision. Nurse s must view health care \"through patients' eyes\" (Cronenwett et al., 2007). To be an effective patient advocate, nurse s must ensure that their patients are informed, respect their patient's autonomy, and respect their patient's health-care decisions. Provision three of the ANA Code of Ethics for Nurses With Interpretive Statements states, \"the nurse promotes, advocates for, and protects health and safety, rights of the patient\" (ANA, 2015a, p. 9). Nurse leaders and managers are responsible for ensuring thatnursing care is delivered with respect for the individual rights and preferences of patients (ANA, 2009a). Advocating for Employees Nurse leaders and managers function as employee advocates by ensuring appropriate resource allocation, promoting a positive work environment (T omajan, 2012), and creating and fostering an ethical work climate for all staff. Provision six of the ANA Code of Ethics states, \"The nurse, through individual and collective effort, establishes, maintains, and improves ethical environment of the work setting and conditions of employment that are conducive to safe, quality health care.\" (ANA, 2015a, p. 23). Ideally, nurse leaders and managers collaborate with staff on issues related to workplace conditions and patient care policies to ensure satisfactoryoutcomes (Olson, 2010). Nurse leaders and managers should \"establish, maintain, and promote conditions ofemployment that enable nurses to practice according to accepted standards\" (ANA, 2015a, p. 28). By keepingstaff informed of executive level decisions, nurse leaders and managers promote professional autonomy amongtheir staff (ANA, 2009a). Nurse leaders and managers must also foster an environment that encourages self-care for nursing staff. Creating a culture of self-renewal will help nurses rediscover or maintain their caring values (Turkel & Ray, 2004). Advocating for the Profession Advocating for the profession is addressed by provision seven of the ANA (2015a) Code of Ethics: \"The nurse in all roles and settings, advances the profession through research and scholarly inquiry, professional standardsdevelopment, and the generation of both nursing and health policy\" (p. 27). Nurse leaders and managers canfurther and advocate for the nursing profession by participating in professional nursing organizations andthrough professional publications and presentations (ANA, 2009a). Advocating for Self Provision five of the Code of Ethics states that, \"[t]he nurse owes the same duties to self as to others, including the responsibility to promote health and safety, preserve wholeness of character, and integrity, maintain compe-tence, and continue personal and professional growth\" (ANA, 2015a, p. 19). It is important for nurse leaders andmanagers to practice self-care, manage stress, and connect with those they manage (ANA, 2009a). Practicingself-care is essential to create a caring harmonious work environment (Turkel & Ray, 2004). Modeling self-carewill also influence staff members in their self-renewal. Advocacy3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 91(Guido, 2010). Nurse leaders and managers can avoid issues of vicarious liability by ensuring that staff members are qualified and competent to perform their assignedduties and that they consistently follow policies and procedures. Nurses are account-able for actions delegated to others assisting in providing nursing care. Therefore,nurses may also have vicarious liability related to delegation. (Chapter 11 examinesdelegation in more detail.) Nurse leaders and managers can be considered negligentwhen they do not fulfill specific responsibilities such as the following (Guido, 2010): Failure to orient, educate, and evaluate: Nurse leaders and managers have an ongo- ing duty to ensure that nurses are performing safe and competent care. This dutyrequires nurse leaders and managers to respond promptly to any concerns aboutunsafe or questionable nursing care. They must act immediately to investigate asituation, correct the situation, and evaluate the nurses involved. On a thoroughinvestigation, nurse leaders and managers must follow up and document in thenurses' employment records as evidence that the nurse is competent to practicein the clinical setting. Inappropriate assigning of staff and failure to supervise: Major responsibilities of nurse leaders and managers include delegation, assignments, and supervision of staff.Nurse leaders and managers retain liability when making assignments and delegating tasks; therefore, they must be knowledgeable about staff education,qualifications, and experiences. Unsafe staffing: Many state and federal legislation as well as regulatory agencies mandate adequate and safe staffing in health-care institutions. Nurse leaders andmanagers must address any unsafe staffing issues. Negligent retention practices: Nurse leaders and managers have a duty not to allow staff members to continue to work if they consistently function below the accept-able standard of care. Failure to warn: Nurse leaders and managers must provide factual and objective information to subsequent employers. Failure to warn potential employers ofemployee incompetence or substance misuse can lead to potential liability. The challenges for nurse leaders and managers include determining and pro- viding for educational needs, assessing competency, providing appropriate eval-uations essential to enhance patient safety, and minimizing organizationalliability.92 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND LEARNING ACTIVITY 4-3How Can the Nurse Advocate for the Patient? Mr. H. is very spiritual. He developed cancer of the throat and was admitted for surgical removal of a tumor. After the surgical proce- dure, Mr. H. developed severe inflammation requiring a tracheostomy. His family approaches the surgeon to ask whether Mr. H. could wear an amulet that has heal-ing properties around his neck. The surgeon responds angrily \"No, absolutely not!He is to have nothing around his neck!\" The family is very upset and tells Mr. H.'snurse about the interaction. How can the nurse advocate for Mr. H. and his family?3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 92Chapter 4 Ethical and Legal Aspects 93 Professional Liability Insurance All nurses are vulnerable to malpractice claims. A malpractice suit can significantly impact a nurse's life emotionally and financially. Professional liability insuranceprotects nurses against lawsuits related to alleged errors that occur while deliveringnursing care. Professional liability insurance benefits include payment for the costof legal advice and representation, payment for court costs, settlement, and reim-bursement for lost wages incurred during a malpractice trial. Nurses can be coveredby an individual insurance policy, under an institutional policy, or as a member ofa group such as a nurse-owned corporation (Aiken, 2004). Health-care institutionstypically carry employer-sponsored insurance and cover nurses with representationshould the need arise. However, insurance provided by a health-care institutionlimits protection of the nurse to only activities performed within the scope of employment. In addition, if a nurse is sued for malpractice and as a result the employer pays for damages caused by the nurse's action or inaction, the employercan sue the nurse to be paid back (Aiken, 2004). Therefore, it is in a nurse's best in-terest to carry his or her own malpractice insurance. \"An individual policy providesthe nurse with 24-hour protection regardless of job description and setting\" (Aiken,2004, p. 406). The nurse would be protected when engaging in nursing activitiessuch as volunteer work, consulting, private duty, and administering care to a neighbor (Aiken, 2004). There are numerous arguments against nurses' having professional liability insurance. A common argument is that if a nurse is found liable and has his or herown insurance policy, the monetary award will be higher. This is a fallacy because,to avoid prejudice and ensure justice, neither judge nor jury can be informed aboutinsurance coverage (Guido, 2010). Another common argument is that the patientwill more likely bring a lawsuit if he or she knows that a nurse has insurance. How-ever, a patient would know whether a nurse has his or her own insurance policyonly if the nurse tells the patient. Whether a nurse has insurance coverage has nobearing on whether or not a patient will sue. The bottom line is that having profes-sional liability insurance will not protect a nurse from a lawsuit, but it will help thenurse with attorney fees, court costs, and the financial obligations if a nurse is foundnegligent (Guido, 2010). ETHICAL AND LEGAL ISSUES Some issues nurse leaders and managers face may be viewed from both an ethicaland a legal perspective. In these cases, nurse leaders and managers must have agood understanding of the ethical principles that guide nursing practice as well asthe laws and regulations that govern health care, nursing practice, and employment. Advance Directives According to ANA Code of Ethics for Nurses, nurses have an obligation to be knowledgeable about the moral and legal rights of their patients regarding self-determination (ANA, 2015a). The PDSA, discussed earlier, mandates that all 3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 93patients have the opportunity to initiate an advance directive , which is a document that provides information about a person's desires should he or she become unable to make health-care decisions. In other words, an advance directive pro-vides directions to family and health-care professionals by a person in advanceof becoming ill and incapacitated. Nurses and other health-care professionalshave an ethical and legal duty to respect a patient's advance directive. Nursescan be held liable for violating a patient's advance directive and could be chargedwith battery and malpractice. A nurse's responsibilities related to advance direc-tives include the following: Initiating discussion with a patient about advance directives Providing a patient with written information about advance directives Communicating the presence of an advance directive to all members of thehealth-care team Ensuring that advance directives are current and accurately reflect the patient'swishes Establishing an advance directive or having discussions with families about life- sustaining care can reduce the burden of decision making for loved ones (Hickman& Pinto, 2013). In addition, advance directives can assist with the delivery of patient-centered care. (See Exploring the Evidence 4-3.) There are three types of advance directives: A living will A do not resuscitate (DNR) order A durable power of attorney for health care Living Will A living will is a legal document that details a person's wishes regarding health-care treatments and procedures in the event the person becomes incapacitated andis facing end of life. Living wills are legal in all states, but elements or what is allowed may vary. Nurses must be familiar with the statutes related to living willsin the state and organization in which they practice. Do Not Resuscitate A DNR order indicates the life-sustaining measures that should be withheld in theevent of impending death. In some instances, an allow natural death (AND) orderis initiated, which means that only comfort measures will be provided. As patientadvocates, nurses play an active role in initiating discussions about DNR and ANDorders with patients, families, and members of the health-care team (ANA, 2012).Nurses \"actively participate in assuring the responsible and appropriate use of interventions to optimize the health and well-being of those in their care. This includes acting to minimize unwarranted, unwanted, or unnecessary medical treat-ment and patient suffering\" (ANA, 2015a, p. 2).94 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 94Chapter 4 Ethical and Legal Aspects 95 Hickman, R. L., & Pinto, M. D. (2013). Advance directives lessen the decisional burden of surrogate decision-making for the chronically ill. Journal of Clinical Nursing, 23, 756-765. Aim This article aims to identify the relationships among advance directive status, demographics, and decisional burden of surrogate decision makers of patientswith chronic critical illness. Methods The investigators conducted a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data obtainedfrom 489 surrogate decision makers of patients with chronic critical illness. Theyused questionnaires to collect demographic and role stress data. The Center forEpidemiological Studies Depression Scale was used to determine the surrogate'sdecisional burden. Key Findings The presence of advance directives diminishes the decisional burden of surrogatesby reducing their role stress and lessens the severity of depressive symptoms. Participants who were nonwhite and had low socioeconomic status and low edu-cational levels were less likely to have documentation of an advance directive. The presence of advance directives promotes patient-centered care by improvingthe quality of shared decision making. Implications for Nurse Leaders and Managers Nurse leaders and managers can ensure that nursing staff members are aware of their responsibilities related to advance directives. Further, they can provide education to ensure that nurses understand the positive benefits of advance direc-tives in reducing surrogate role stress and decisional burden as well as promotingpatient-centered care.EXPLORING THE EVIDENCE 4-3 Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care A durable power of attorney for health care is a legal document that identifies a health-care surrogate. The surrogate is a person designated to make health-caredecisions for another person, who is incapacitated. The health-care surrogateshould have a clear understanding of the person's wishes regarding health careand be willing to respect those wishes even if he or she does not agree. By partic-ipating in discussions with surrogates, providing guidance and referrals, andidentifying problems in the decision-making process, nurses will support patientself-determination (ANA, 2015a). 3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 95Nurse leaders and managers must ensure that policies and procedures support the appropriate use of interventions to minimize patient suffering and optimize end-of-life nursing care. Confidentiality and Information Security Every patient has an ethical and legal right to privacy and confidentiality. Nurses arebound by their code of ethics to respect patients' privacy and confidentiality, whichincludes ensuring patient information is secure at all times. The HIPAA, discussedearlier in this chapter, requires that nurses protect all verbal and written communi-cation about patients, including medical records, electronic records, and verbal ex-change of patient information such as patient teaching and change-of-shift report.The HIPAA requires health-care agencies to monitor staff adherence to related poli-cies and procedures, computer privacy, and data security. Nurses must be aware ofinstitutional policies and procedures related to patient privacy and confidentiality. A new area of concern internationally is the use of social media and other elec- tronic communication. Although social networks such as Facebook, Twitter,Snapchat, Instagram, YouTube, and LinkedIn offer opportunities for knowledgeexchange and dissemination among local, national, and global communities, theyalso pose substantial risks. All nurses have an obligation to understand the nature,benefits, and consequences of participating in social networking (ANA, 2011). Misusing social media can have severe consequences, such as disciplinary action by state boards of nursing that range from cautionary letters to licensure suspen-sion. Violation of federal and state laws can result in civil or criminal penalties including fines and imprisonment (Spector & Kappel, 2012). Nurses can also faceliability for defamation, invasion of privacy, and harassment, depending on thetype of postings and social media (NCSBN, 2011c). Nurse leaders and managers are obligated to enforce organizational policies and procedures related to social media and networking and to address any breach ofconfidentiality and privacy immediately. As long as nurses remain aware of theirprofessional obligations, using social networking will not be an issue. The ANA'sPrinciples for Social Networking are listed in Box 4-4. 96 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND BOX 4-4BOX 4-4 American Nurses Association Principles American Nurses Association Principles for Social Networkingfor Social Networking 1.Nurses must not transmit or place online individu- ally identifiable patient information. 2.Nurses must observe ethically prescribed profes-sional patient-nurse boundaries. 3.Nurses should understand that patients, colleagues,institutions, and employers may view postings. 4.Nurses should take advantage of privacy settingsand seek to separate personal and professional information online. 5.Nurses should bring to the attention of appropriateauthorities content that could harm a patient's privacy, rights, or welfare. 6.Nurses should participate in developing institutionalpolicies governing online conduct. From ANA, 2011, pp. 6-7.3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 96Informed Consent Informed consent represents the ethical principle of autonomy and reflects the patient's autonomous decision to accept or refuse health care. Informed consent is also a legal process by which a patient or legal representative voluntarily givespermission for a treatment or procedure. There are two required components to informed consent: \"The patient must be fully informed and there must be voluntaryconsent\" (Guido, 2010, p. 152). Informed consent mandates that the patient mustbe given information in terms he or she understands, alternatives to the plannedprocedure, and the related risks and benefits of all options. This information allowsthe patient to make an informed decision. A nurse's role in obtaining informed consent includes the following (Guido, 2010): Verifying that the health-care provider gave the patient the necessary informationto make an \"informed\" consent Ensuring that the patient understands the information and procedure or treatment Validating that the patient is competent to give consent Witnessing that the patient sign the consent form Notifying the health-care provider if the patient does not understand the proce-dure or treatment Documenting the informed consent process Disruptive Behavior, Incivility, and Bullying In 2008, TJC published a Sentinel Event Alert describing behaviors that underminea culture of safety. Disruptive behavior includes \"overt actions such as verbal outbursts and physical threats, as well as passive activities as refusing to performassigned tasks or quietly exhibiting uncooperative attitudes during routine activi-ties\" (TJC, 2008, para 2). Such behavior threatens patient safety and a healthy workenvironment because of a breakdown in communication and collaboration. Lateral violence, incivility, and bullying are examples of disruptive behaviors often seen on the nursing unit. Lateral violence refers to acts that occur betweennurses. Incivility consists of rude and discourteous actions and includes gossip-ing and spreading rumors. Bullying is described as unharmful actions intendedto humiliate, offend, and cause distress (ANA, 2015c). Bullying can include Chapter 4 Ethical and Legal Aspects 97 LEARNING ACTIVITY 4-4 Is This a Breach of Privacy? Susan is a registered nurse caring for Mr. Jones, who was just admitted for possible pancreatic cancer. Bill, a nurse from a different unit, stops by to visit and tells Susan that Mr. Jones is his neighbor. Later, Susan observesBill at the computer looking at Mr. Jones's electronic health record. 1. What provision(s) in the ANA Code of Ethics could apply to this situation? 2. Do Bill's actions violate HIPAA rules? 3. What action should Susan take? 4. What action should the nurse leader and manager take? 3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 97negative acts perpetrated by one in a higher level of authority, a misuse of power (ANA, 2013, 2015c). Lateral violence, incivility, and bullying have a major impacton nursing, including low staff morale; increased absenteeism; attrition; unman-aged anger leading to insomnia, hypertension, depression, and gastrointestinal dis-orders; and threatened patient care quality (ANA, 2013, 2015c). Nurses must treatall individuals with whom they interact with respect and compassion. The ANACode of Ethics for Nurses asserts that nurses must create an ethical environment and culture of civility and kindness and treat colleagues, coworkers, employees, stu-dents, and others with dignity and respect. Further, \"disregard for the effects ofone's actions on others, bullying, harassment, intimidation, manipulation, threats,or violence are always morally unacceptable behaviors\" (ANA, 2015c, p. 4). Nurses can help combat disruptive behavior by being mindful of their own behavior and stepping in when they see disruptive behavior (ANA, 2009b). Nurseleaders and managers must promote workplace respect and develop and main-tain policies and procedures to address disruptive behavior. Disruptive behavior,incivility, and bullying are discussed further in Chapter 13. Unsafe or Questionable Practice The ANA Code of Ethics for Nurses directs nurses to intervene when unsafe or ques- tionable practice is witnessed. \"Nurses must be alert to and must take appropriateaction in all instances of incompetent, unethical, illegal, or impaired practice, or actions that places the rights or best interests of the patient in jeopardy\" (ANA, 2015a,p. 12). Examples of unsafe or questionable practice include providing substandardnursing care, neglecting to follow hand washing procedures, failure to follow insti-tutional policy and procedures, and practicing while under the influence of alcoholor drugs. A nurse leader or manager who observes a nurse performing unsafe prac-tice should confront the nurse in an effort to change the practice. After speaking tothe nurse, if care continues to be unsafe, a nurse leader or manager must take action(disciplinary action is further discussed in Chapter 10). Nurse leaders and managersmust also support staff members who report unsafe practice by listening and actingon the information provided. In some cases, the unsafe practitioner is reprimandedfor violating policy and procedure. However, nurse leader and managers may be re-quired to report the nurse to the state board of nursing if the NPA is violated. SUMMARY There are many ethical and legal aspects of professional nursing. Nurses must use the ANA Code of Ethics for Nurses , Nursing's Social Policy Statement , Scope and Standards of Practice, and their state NPA to guide their nursing practice daily.Nurses at all levels and in all settings are accountable and responsible for their decisions, judgments, and actions. Nurse leaders and managers play a major role in establishing, maintaining, and monitoring standards of nursing care. Nurseleaders and managers are charged with determining and providing for educationalneeds of their staff and with assessing and evaluating staff competency to optimizepatient safety and minimize organizational liability. 98 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch04_061-101 14/01/17 3:55 PM Page 98SUGGESTED WEBSITES American Association of Legal Nurse Consultants: www.aalnc.org American Nurses Association: www.nursingworld.org Ethics and Compliance Initiative: www.ethics.org Legal Eagle Eye Newsletter for the Nursing Profession: www.nursinglaw.com National Council of State Boards of Nursing: www.ncsbn.org REFERENCES Aiken, T.

Murray, PhD, RN, CNE KEY TERMS Appreciative inquiry Critical thinkingDecision makingIntuitive thinkingProblem solvingReactive thinkingReflective thinkingShared decision making In response to advances in health care since the 1960s, the responsibilities of pro- fessional nurses have evolved to accommodate the complexity of health care, ad- vanced technology, changing demographics of the patient population, and the acuity of patients. Nurses must be able to process an ever-increasing amount of informationto make complex decisions and solve complicated problems in the delivery of pa-tient care (Facione, Facione, & Sanchez, 1994). Nurses must master effective criticalthinking, clinical judgment, clinical reasoning, communication, and assessment skills(American Association of Colleges of Nursing [AACN], 2008). Nurse leaders and managers must not only practice critical thinking and effec- tive decision making but also be role models to their staff. They must develop theintellectual capacities and skills necessary to become disciplined, self-directed, crit-ical thinkers (Heaslip, 2008, para. 1). In addition, they must be experts in decisionmaking and problem solving at various levels of the organization. This chapterLEARNING OUTCOMES Explain the importance of critical thinking skills in the provision of safe and quality care. Describe elements of critical thinking and the cognitive skills necessary tothink critically. Examine how nurse leaders and managers can foster critical thinkingamong staff members. Discuss the relationship between the nursing process and decision making. Describe the benefits of shared decision making. Describe the four steps of appreciative inquiry.3021_Ch05_102-117 14/01/17 3:54 PM Page 102breaks down the processes of critical thinking and decision making, relates them to the nursing process, and describes effective tools nurse leaders and managerscan use when engaged in these processes. Knowledge, skills, and attitudes related to the following core competencies are included in this chapter: patient-centered care, teamwork and collaboration, andinformatics. CRITICAL THINKING Critical thinking is a complicated process that involves skillfully directing the thinking process and imposing intellectual standards on the elements of thought. A more formaldefinition is as follows: \"the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfullyconceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating informationgathered from or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or com-munication, as a guide to belief and action\" (Scriven & Paul, n.d., para. 1). Nursingorganizations and accrediting agencies identify critical thinking as an important skillfor professional nursing practice (AACN, 2008; American Nurses Association [ANA],2015a; National Council of State Boards of Nursing [NCSBN], 2013). Critical thinking in nursing \"includes adherence to intellectual standards, profi- ciency in using reasoning, a commitment to develop and maintain intellectual traitsof the mind and habits of thought and the competent use of thinking skills and abil-ities for sound clinical judgments and safe decision-making\" (Heaslip, 2008, para. 2).Table 5-1 displays various definitions of critical thinking found in the nursing literature. Critical thinking is an important component of professional nursing be-cause it is an essential skill for processing patient data and is inherent in makingsound clinical judgments and safe patient care decisions. Nursing actions require critical thinking to integrate increasingly complex knowledge, skills, technologies,and patient care activities into evidence-based nursing practice (NCSBN, 2013, p. 3).Critical thinking plays an integral role in clinical practice as well as in nursing lead-ership and management. It is a critical process that systematically frames the nurseleader and manager's thoughts, decisions, and actions (Porter-O'Grady et al., 2005). Elements of and Cognitive Skills for Critical Thinking Critical thinking involves eight elements of thought (Heaslip, 2008, para. 5): 1.The problem, question, concern, or issue being thought about by the thinker (i.e., what the thinker is attempting to figure out) 2.The purpose or goal of the thinking (i.e., what does the thinker hope to accomplish?) 3.The frame of reference, point of view, or worldview the thinker holds about theissue or problem 4.The assumptions the thinker holds true about the issue or problem 5.The central concepts, ideas, principles, and theories the thinker uses in reasoningabout the issue or problem 6.The evidence, data, or information provided to support the claims the thinkermakes about the issue or problemChapter 5 Critical Thinking and Decision Making 103 3021_Ch05_102-117 14/01/17 3:54 PM Page 1037.The interpretations, inferences, reasoning, and lines of formulated thought that lead to the thinker's conclusions 8.The implications and consequences that follow from the positions the thinkerholds on the issue or problem Critical thinking is a skill that requires practice and that must be nurtured and reinforced over time (Ignatavicius, 2001). It is more than seeking a solution to an issue or problem\u2014it involves examining and analyzing situations, considering allpoints of view, and identifying options. To think critically and make sound deci-sions, nurse leaders and managers must engage in the processes of reflection, judg-ment, evaluation, and criticism (Zori & Morrison, 2009). There are six essential104 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND Source Masters, 2014 Porter-O'Grady & Malloch, 2013AACN, 2008 Benner, Hughes, Tobin, 1998Facione, Facione, & Sanchez, 1994Definition Critical thinking for clinical decision making is the ability to think in a systematic and logical manner, with openness to question and reflect onthe reasoning process used to ensure safe nursing practice and qualitycare (p. 218).[Critical thinking is] active, purposeful, organized thinking that takes intoconsideration focus, language, frame of reference, attitudes, assumptions,evidence, reasoning, conclusions, implications, and context when decidingwhat to believe or do (pp. 432-433).Critical thinking underlies decision making and involves the process ofquestioning, analyzing, synthesizing, interpreting, inferring, using inductiveand deductive reasoning, using intuition, and creativity (p. 36)Critical thinking involves the application of knowledge and experience toidentify patient problems and to direct clinical judgment and actions thatresult in positive patient outcomes (p. 2)[Critical thinking is] the ability to think in a systematic and logical mannerwith openness to question and reflect on the reasoning process used toensure safe nursing practice and quality care (para 2).Critical thinking is deliberate, purposeful, and informed outcome-focusedthinking that requires careful identification of key problems, issues, andrisks involved. Further, critical thinking requires specific knowledge, skills,and experience (p. 30).Purposeful, outcome-directed thinking is based on a body of scientificknowledge derived from research and other courses of evidence (p. 31)[Critical thinking is] an essential component of professional accountabilityand quality nursing care and includes the cognitive skills of analyzing, ap-plying standards, discriminating, information seeking, logical reasoning,predicting, and transforming knowledge (p. 357).[Critical thinking is] a process influenced by knowledge and experienceusing strategies such as reflective thinking as a part of learning to identifythe issues and opportunities and holistically synthesize the information innursing practice (p. 268).[Critical thinking is] purposive, self-regulatory judgment (p. 349). Table 5-1 Definitions of Critical Thinking in Nursing3021_Ch05_102-117 14/01/17 3:54 PM Page 104cognitive skills necessary to becoming an expert critical thinker (Porter-O'Grady et al., 2005): 1.Interpretation involves clarifying data and circumstances to determine meaning and significance. For nurse leaders and managers, interpretation reflects their abil-ity to comprehend the significance of a wide variety of circumstances, establishpriorities, categorize data, and clarify the related impact on people and systems. 2.Analysis is determining a problem or issue based on assessment data. Nurse leaders and managers engage in analysis to identify relationships among struc-tures, processes, outcomes, and other frameworks of thought with the goals ofexamining various arguments, issues, and themes and determining elementsand origins of the argument. 3.Inference is about drawing conclusions. Nurse leaders and managers draw con- clusions about situations after careful analysis and begin to form a foundationon which an action will be based. 4.Evaluation is determining whether expected outcomes have or have not been met. If outcomes have not been met, evaluation also involves examining why.Nurse leaders and managers engage in evaluation to assess the reliability andcredibility of the descriptions, perceptions, experiences, situations, and relation-ships of these elements to determine their value in the overall process. The nurseleader and manager gains confidence in the evaluation of the outcome, whichwill direct decisions and actions. 5.Explanation is the ability to justify actions with evidence. Nurse leaders and managers establish a viable explanation about the conclusions drawn duringthe evaluation process. The role of the nurse leader and manager is to providesystematic and organized reasoning behind the conclusion so that it can betranslated into a level of understanding for others. 6.Self-regulation is the process of examining one's practice for strengths and weak- nesses in critical thinking and promoting continuous improvement. Nurse lead-ers and managers engage in self-regulation to become more informed and refinetheir skills in problem identification, analysis, and inference and to develop expert critical thinking skills. Reactive, Reflective, and Intuitive Thinking Nurses use critical thinking to explore, understand, analyze, and apply knowledgein various practice situations. Not engaging in critical thinking when caring for patients, making decisions, or dealing with challenging situations can result in theuse of reactive thinking. Reactive thinking is an automatic or kneejerk reaction to sit- uations that has consequences leading to vague or inaccurate reasoning, sloppyand superficial thinking, and poor nursing practice (Heaslip, 2008; Zori & Morrison,2009). Nurse leaders and managers who engage in reactive thinking use automatic,thoughtless responses to solve problems that often result in errors or ineffectivedecision making. Consider the following scenario: Several nurses are going backto school to advance their education, and they approach the nurse manager aboutimplementing a different scheduling method that would allow nurses to workChapter 5 Critical Thinking and Decision Making 105 3021_Ch05_102-117 14/01/17 3:54 PM Page 105every weekend with extra days off during the week, rather than the current practice of scheduling all nurses to work every other weekend. The nurse manager doesnot believe that the proposed scheduling method would be fair to all nurses andrefuses to consider any changes. In this example, the nurse manager does not con-sider input from the staff, makes an assumption without taking any time to thinkabout the decision critically, and does not give staff the opportunity to engage inshared decision making, thus possibly resulting in nurse dissatisfaction. The nurs-ing staff members will probably not challenge the nurse manager's decision be-cause they may not feel comfortable discussing the topic further. Reflective thinkingrestricts innovation and maintains status quo (Zori & Morrison, 2009). Rather, critical thinking should involve some reflection on previous experiences to analyze a situation, make judgments, and draw conclusions. Reflective thinking consists of deliberate thinking and understanding using one's own personal expe-riences and knowledge, and it involves assessing what is known, what needs to beknown, and how to bridge the gap between the two (Masters, 2014). Reflectivethinking requires thoughtful personal self-assessment, analysis, and synthesis ofstrengths, all of which can help nurses develop the skill of self-improvement. Usingreflective thinking, nurses must examine and question underlying assumptionsand their validity (Benner, Hughes, & Sutphen, 2008). When engaged in reflective thinking, nurses (Masters, 2014, p. 221): Determine what information is needed for understanding the issue. Examine what has already been experienced related to an issue. Gather available information. Synthesize the information and opinions. Consider the synthesis from different perspectives and frames of reference. Create some meaning from the relevant information and opinions. Nurse leaders and managers find that using reflective thinking in complex situ- ations is beneficial because it forces them to step back, assess the situation, andthink about how to solve the problem. Reflective thinking can result in fewer errorsand more effective decision making. Considering the situation just discussed, usingreflecting thinking when the staff members makes their request, the nurse managertells the staff members that she will consider alternative scheduling methods. Shereviews the organization's staffing policies and determines that a change is feasible.The nurse leader and manager creates a team and asks for nurses from all shifts to volunteer to be part of the team. At the first meeting, she outlines the currentpolicies and charges the team to determine the number of nurses willing to workweekends and to identify a feasible schedule to ensure safe staffing. After inputfrom all staff members, the team finalizes a feasible schedule, which is then imple-mented. By engaging in reflective thinking, the nurse manager promotes shareddecision making among the staff members, who then feel empowered and satisfiedwith the scheduling process. There are instances in which nurses claim to use intuition or \"gut feelings\" when providing patient care. Intuitive thinking is an instant understanding of knowl- edge without supporting evidence. It has also been described as an intuitive graspor a clear understanding of a situation based on a background of similar situations106 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch05_102-117 14/01/17 3:54 PM Page 106(Benner, 1984). Some reject intuition as an element of critical thinking because it is abstract and seems irrational. However, intuition is a cognitive skill used by nursesto assist assessment of situations and can lead the nurse to take quick action in thedelivery of safe, effective patient care (Robert, Tilley, & Petersen, 2014). Intuitive think-ing is a nonconscious state of knowing that integrates memory and pattern recogni-tion without cognitive direction (Payne, 2015). Expert nurses do not rely on criticalthinking alone; rather, they form an intuitive understanding of a patient's situationbased on previous knowledge, experiences, and pattern recognition (Benner, 1984;Payne, 2015). Nurse leaders and managers use intuitive thinking as they deal withday-to-day unit-level situations. Intuition is based on previous knowledge and experience and triggers a response or reflection to resolve an issue. Modeling Critical Thinking Nurses use critical thinking continually while caring for patients, coordinating care,collaborating with others, advocating for patients, problem solving, resolving issues,and ensuring that safe and quality patient care is provided. One's ability to thinkcritically can be affected by many factors such as age, education, experience, andwork environment. Nurse leaders and managers play a pivotal role in helping staffmembers enhance their critical thinking skills (Ignatavicius, 2001). A major functionof nurse leaders and managers is to be a role model for staff by being critical thinkersthemselves. In addition, staff members rely on nurse leaders and managers to helpsolve clinical, interpersonal, and unit-related problems. Nurse leaders and managerswho use reflective thinking and provide guidance to staff in a credible manner willcreate a sense of trust and safety on the unit (Zori, Nosek, & Musil, 2010). In contrast,nurse leaders and managers who engage in reactive thinking may miss opportuni-ties for self-growth, to role model critical thinking for staff, and to create changesthat are long-lasting and goal driven (Zori & Morrison, 2009). In an evidence-basedpractice world, it is becoming increasingly important that nurse leaders and man-agers articulate to staff the value and application of critical thinking as a normal expectation of professional nursing practice (Porter-O'Grady et al., 2005). Nurseleaders and managers must encourage staff to analyze situations, challenge assump-tions, explore alternative options, and embrace continuous improvement. Enforcingthe expectation of using critical thinking with rewards and recognition can result in a positive work environment. The encouragement of critical thinking by nurseleaders and managers creates a legitimate foundation for accurate and effective decision making on the unit (Porter-O'Grady et al., 2005). DECISION MAKING People, in general, make many decisions in an average day. Some decisions aresmall and are made with little effort (i.e., deciding what to eat for breakfast),whereas others may be more involved and take several days (i.e., purchasing anew car). Regardless of how complex a decision may be, the basic elements ofthe decision-making process are present. Decision making \"is a process of choosing the best alternatives to achieve individual and organizational objectives\" (Guo,Chapter 5 Critical Thinking and Decision Making 107 3021_Ch05_102-117 14/01/17 3:54 PM Page 1072008, p. 118). Nurses at the bedside typically make two types of decisions: 1) patient care decisions, or those that affect direct patient care; and 2) condition-of-work decisions, or those that affect the work environment (Krairiksh & Anthony, 2001). Decisions made by nurse leaders and managers have a broaderscope, in that they can affect many people and can have a greater impact on theoverall unit or organization. Decision making consists of the following steps (McConnell, 2000): 1.Gathering information involves collecting information that will direct the decision- making process. Often, gathering information involves observations. The focusduring this step is to gather data that are worthwhile and pertinent to the decisionto be made. One shortcoming for most people is the tendency to move from observation to conclusion without enough information. 2.Analyzing information and creating alternatives often overlap with gathering infor- mation because, in this step, information is logically arranged and put into context for evaluation. As information is being organized, alternatives emerge.The amount of time spent analyzing and creating alternatives is directly relatedto the weight of the decision to be made. 3.Selecting a preferred alternative comes about during analysis, when often the best alternative emerges. During this step, it is important to consider what is arealistic and feasible alternative, keeping in mind factors such as time, money,quality, personalities, and policies. 4.Implementation consists of taking the selected alternative and putting it into action. 5.Follow-up on implementation includes communication and clarification to ensure that staff members know what is expected of them; checking on the timing andensuring that the change is not overwhelming to staff because of other factors;performing ongoing analysis and monitoring of any circumstances that may require adjustments to the implementation plan; evaluating suggestions fromothers; withdrawing a poor choice, if necessary; admitting mistakes; and, in theend, sticking with the right decision. Decision making is a dynamic process and must include evidence-based research. All nurses have the authority, accountability, and responsibility to make decisions and take action consistent with the obligation to promote health and toprovide optimal patient care (ANA, 2015a). Nurse leaders and managers mustmake autonomous operational decisions with the same considerations. Decision Making and the Nursing Process The ANA (2015a) Nursing Scope and Standards of Practice delineates the competent level of nursing practice and uses the nursing process as a critical-thinking frame-work to guide nursing practice. The nursing process is cyclical and dynamic, inter-personal and collaborative, and universally applicable. It is fundamental to nursingpractice and provides a clinical reasoning approach to patient care that uses six interrelated steps (ANA, 2015a). Nurse leaders and managers integrate the nursingprocess with leadership and management competencies to effectively make deci-sions that guide nursing practice, set strategic goals, create and sustain healthy work108 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch05_102-117 14/01/17 3:54 PM Page 108environments, influence organizational and public policy, resource management (human, material, financial), population health management, legal and regulatorycompliance, and promote safe quality patient outcomes (ANA, 2016). Nurse leadersand managers apply the steps of the nursing process when making decisions at theunit and organizational levels: Assessment involves continually collecting data in a systematic manner relative to an issue, situation, the work environment, or trends. Nurse leaders and man-agers use data collected to problem solve, make decisions, identify gaps in care,and identify patterns and variances related to the situation. Diagnosis (analysis) includes identifying issues, problems, or trends and validating them with stakeholders when possible. Nurse leaders and managers use data tosupport and enhance decision-making and document issues, problems, or trendsto help determine an individualized plan. Outcomes identification includes identifying expected outcomes for an individu- alized plan of care. Nurse leaders and managers identify expected outcomes fora plan developed to address issues, problems, or trends. Planning is the development of an individualized plan in partnership with members of the health-care team and the appropriate stakeholders. The planis prioritized and includes a timeline. Nurse leaders and managers design theplan by considering the current statutes, rules, regulations, and standards andby integrating best practices. Implementation of the plan involves coordinating the implementation of a plan and associated processes in collaboration with the health-care team in a safe and timely manner using evidence-based interventions specific to the issue, prob-lem, or trend (ANA, 2016). Nurse leaders and managers incorporate principlesof systems management, new knowledge, and strategies to initiate change,achieve desired outcomes, and establish strategies to promote health, education,and a safe environment (ANA, 2016). Evaluation involves ongoing evaluation of the outcomes in relation to structures, processes, nurse-sensitive indicators, and stakeholder responses. Nurse leadersand managers use the results of evaluation analysis to make or recommendchanges to policies and procedures as needed. The nursing process encompasses all actions taken by nurses at every level, provides a framework for critical thinking, and forms the foundation of decisionmaking with the goal of safe, quality, and evidence-based nursing care (ANA, 2015a,2016). Table 5-2 shows the relationship between the nursing process and decisionmaking for nurse leaders and managers. Tools for Decision Making Tools for decision making provide nurse leaders and managers a systematic way to collect and manage necessary data and assist in visualizing alternatives.There are numerous tools and techniques available that can be used to ensureeffective decision making. By using a tool for decision making, nurse leadersand managers can approach decision making in an organized and systematicmanner. Chapter 5 Critical Thinking and Decision Making 109 3021_Ch05_102-117 14/01/17 3:54 PM Page 109DECIDE Model Using a decision-making model can help ensure that all steps of decision making are addressed, thereby avoiding jumping to a conclusion before all information iscollected and analyzed. A model for decision making identified by Guo (2008) usesthe acronym DECIDE to represent the steps in the decision-making process. Thesteps of the DECIDE model are listed in Box 5-1. Decision-Making Grid Analysis Decision-making grid analysis is one of the simplest tools a nurse leader and man-ager can use, especially if the decision involves more than one feasible alternative.This technique involves listing options and factors on a table or grid. The possibleoptions or alternatives are listed on the rows of the table, and factors impacting the110 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND Nursing Process Assessment Diagnosis Identification of outcomes Planning Implementation Evaluation Table 5-2 Comparison of Nursing Process and Decision Making for Nurse Leaders and Managers Compiled from ANA, 2016, ANA, 2015a, and Guo, 2008.Example Related to Short Staffing The nurse leader and manager gathers data related to the issue and trends. Data to consider would be unit census, patientacuity, the number of discharges and admis-sions, and staff mix. The nurse leader and manager identifies theproblem, explores possible causes, considersalternative strategies for staffing, and identifiesthe expected outcome. Alternatives to consider may include alteringcurrent staffing methods and increasing stafflevels during peak admission and dischargetimes. The expected outcome is safe staffing. The nurse leader and manager develops astaffing plan that identifies strategies toachieve the expected outcome of safe staffing. The nurse leader and manager implements thestaffing plan in a timely and efficient manner. The nurse leader and manager coordinates the material and the interprofessional and intraprofessional resources needed to imple-ment the plan. The nurse leader and manager evaluates theprogress of the staffing plan and whether theexpected outcome of safe staffing is met. If safe staffing is not met, the cycle beginsagain with assessment.Decision Making D = Define the problem E = Establish the criteria C = Consider alternatives I = Identify the best alternatives D = Develop and implement a plan of action E = Evaluate and monitor the solution and feedback if necessary3021_Ch05_102-117 14/01/17 3:54 PM Page 110decision are listed on the columns. Next, a numerical score (e.g., in a range of 0 to 3) is assigned to each option to indicate poor to very good or not likely to very likely;it is acceptable to use the same score more than once. For example, a nurse manageris determining which shift would be best for a particular unit. Options or alterna-tives include 12-hour shifts, 10-hour shifts, and 8-hour shifts. Next, factors to consider are determined by the nurse manager with staff input and are based onevidence. Factors to be considered in this case are nurse satisfaction, nurse fatigue, patient satisfaction, and potential for adverse events. Then, the nurse man-ager assigns weights first to each option and then to each factor based on impor-tance, with 0 being the least important and 3 being the most important. The weightsfor each option are multiplied by the weights assigned to the factors for a total. Theoption with the highest total becomes the most feasible option.

However, it can also be very useful in decision making for nurses. SWOTstands for S trengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. Strengths and weak- nesses are internal factors, or those within the organization or the unit, whereas3021_Ch05_102-117 14/01/17 3:54 PM Page 111opportunities and threats are seen as external factors, or those outside the organi- zation or unit (Pearce, 2007). Nurse leaders and managers who make decisionsusing a SWOT analysis can improve outcomes for both patients and nurses by iden-tifying the strengths and weaknesses of the staff, areas for improvement, and opportunities for facilitating positive change (Roussel, 2013). SWOT analysis is discussed further in Chapter 8. Shared Decision Making The role of the nurse leader and manager is shifting from making all unit-relateddecisions to designing effective shared decision-making processes. Shared decision making is the inclusion of staff nurses in decision making related to patient care and work methods at the unit and organizational levels. Shared decision making re-quires nurse leaders and managers to involve staff nurses in decisions about hiring,scheduling, and performance evaluations (appraisals), as well as include them ingeneral unit discussions (Graham-Dickerson et al., 2013). Nurses engaged in shareddecision making are empowered to provide effective, efficient, safe, and compassion-ate quality care and have opportunities for ongoing professional growth and devel-opment (ANA, 2015b). Unit cultures with shared decision making foster a healthywork environment and promote safe and quality patient care. Moreover, shared de-cision making is a positive factor in job satisfaction and nurse recruitment and reten-tion (Houser et al., 2012; Scherb, Specht, Loes, & Reed, 2011; Shiparski, 2005). Although not yet the norm in all organizations, shared decision making is a stan- dard in Magnet-recognized organizations and has been shown to have a positiveimpact on nurse satisfaction, nurse recruitment and retention, patient satisfaction,and reduction of adverse events (Houser et al., 2012). The ANA's Code of Ethics for Nurses With Interpretive Statements suggests that nurse leaders and managers are responsible to ensure that nurses are included on teams at the unit and organiza-tional level and in decision-making processes that affect the quality and safety ofpatient care (ANA, 2015b). According to the ANA's Nursing Administration: Scope and Standards of Practice, nurse leaders and managers are encouraged to develop skills in shared decision making (ANA, 2016). Shared decision making is identifiedby the American Organization of Nurse Executives (AONE) as a communicationand relationship-building competency and states that nurse leaders and managersshould \"engage staff and others in decision-making; promote decisions that are patient-centered; and provide an environment conducive to opinion sharing\"(AONE, 2007, p. 4). Appreciative Inquiry In many cases, part of the decision-making process involves problem solving. Problem solving consists of the act of identifying a problem and implementing an ac- tive systematic process to solve that problem. Problem solving requires lookingclosely at problems, failures, and negative outcomes and then finding a solution. One possible approach to problem solving is appreciative inquiry. Appreciative inquiry is a problem-solving strategy that capitalizes on the positive characteristics112 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch05_102-117 14/01/17 3:54 PM Page 112of an outcome by valuing and building on them. The end product of appreciative inquiry is a culture change or the development of a vision or plan (Manion, 2011).Appreciative inquiry is based on the belief that there is something similar in theorganization somewhere that is already working, and it focuses on recognizing andfinding a positive attribute and studying that element to gain insight into handlingthe current issue (Manion, 2011; Meline & Brehm, 2015). Appreciative inquiry is acollaborative process that engages staff in a healthy exchange of knowledge to solveproblems and innovate change. It avoids focusing on the negatives by shifting theperspective to what works best in the organization. There are four stages of appreciate inquiry, commonly referred to as the four Ds. Stage one is discovery, or the discovery phase, and it involves storytelling.

Aim The aims of this study were to explore the perceptions of hospital-based nurses regarding their involvement in decision making and to gain an understanding ofthe ways nurses would like to be involved in decision making. Methods The investigators used a qualitative descriptive design and conducted focus groupswith registered nurses and individual interviews with chief nursing officers from 10 rural and suburban hospitals in Colorado. Key Findings Data were analyzed using components of grounded theory. Seven themes emerged:collaboration, increased involvement, problem identification, formal or informalcommunication, accountability, autonomy in decision making, and empowerment.Involvement in decision making was perceived by all in the study as having a positive impact on the work environment and nurse satisfaction at work. Nurses indicated that being involved in decision making made them feel more confidentand valued by the organization. Further, they described involvement as an invest-ment and a sense of personal ownership of the organization. Implications for Nurse Leaders and Managers Nurse leaders and managers can use the findings of this study to inform theirmanagement styles. The authors suggest that nurse leaders and managers shouldlisten to their staff when they make recommendations and provide feedback onhow the recommendations will be implemented or modified. Further, includingstaff nurses in unit-level decision making can improve patient outcomes and nurse satisfaction.EXPLORING THE EVIDENCE 5-13021_Ch05_102-117 14/01/17 3:54 PM Page 113question answered in this phase is \"What gives life?\" The goal in this first phase is to identify what works best. The next stage is dreaming, or the envisioning phase,during which the question to be answered is \"What might be?\" Staff members thinkahead and imagine a future based on the positives identified during the discoveryphase. Stage three is design, or the co-constructing phase, because the focus duringthis stage is to design the ideal and to identify the structures and processes neces-sary to make the dream a reality. The question asked at this stage is \"What shouldbe?\" The final stage is destiny, or the sustaining phase. The goal of the last phase is to determine how to actualize, sustain, or create the identified characteristics.During the last stage, the focus is on the positive and on empowering everyone tosustain the vision.

Sustaining shared decision making: A biennial task force process. American Nurse Today , 10(3), 52-54. Aim The authors share their experience of using appreciative inquiry to enhance shareddecision making. The nursing division of a hospital in Ohio established a shareddecision-making task force that convenes biennially to critically review currentsuggestions, structures, and processes to improve patient care and professionalnursing practice. Process At the first meeting of the task force each year, a current purpose is defined. Inthe example provided by the authors, the purpose was to influence and enhancethe future of professional nursing practice through evaluation of their shared governance structure and function (p. 53). Once the focus of the appreciative inquiry process is identified, the task force proceeds with discovery, dream, design, and destiny: Discovery: The task force asks the following questions: What is working now? What do we not want to lose? What are our shared decision-making strengths? The task force then focuses on the strengths, to shift the process from problemsolving to appreciating and improving the positive qualities. Dream: The goal in this step is to start a creative process. The team begins this step asking the members to draw a picture to symbolize their dream for thenursing division. During this step, they also engage in brainstorming. Design: The task force identifies the top ideas for improvement from the brain- storming session. Communication, mentoring, and accountability were identi-fied in the example the authors presented. The team then identified a list ofEXPLORING THE EVIDENCE 5-23021_Ch05_102-117 14/01/17 3:54 PM Page 114Chapter 5 Critical Thinking and Decision Making 115 specific desires related to each topic. Next, to merge the dream with reality, the task force asks the following questions: What is the benefit? What actions are needed to make the change? Who will the change affect? Who should be involved? Destiny: The task force envisions their destiny by writing recommendations with detailed rationales and submits them to the leadership council. Outcomes The authors conclude that using appreciative inquiry in their shared decision-making process has enhanced their process and guided the task force in makingtheir dream a reality. Implications for Nurse Leaders and Managers This article provides nurse leaders and managers with an example of the real-lifeapplication of shared decision making and appreciative inquiry in nursing. Theprocesses can be used at both the unit and organizational levels.EXPLORING THE EVIDENCE 5-2\u2014cont'd SUMMARY All nurses, regardless of their role, must develop critical thinking and decision- making skills. Providing safe and quality patient care involves effective critical think-ing skills, and nurse leaders and managers must encourage staff members to be crit-ical thinkers. Critical thinking involves thinking in a systematic and logical way andgenerating, implementing, and evaluating approaches to promoting positive patientand nurse outcomes. Reflective thinking and intuitive thinking are elements of critical thinking, and they are based on well-established experiences and providevaluable insight into decision making. Critical thinking is interrelated with decisionmaking and the nursing process. Nurse leaders and managers achieve outcomes by building on the nursing process when making patient care and unit decisions.Effective nurse leaders and managers model sound critical thinking and decision-making skills as well as foster open communication and give voice to staff by encouraging shared decision making. In turn, nurses find meaning in their workand share a commitment to patient safety and quality (ANA, 2016).

Murray, PhD, RN, CNE Communication is an essential tool for nursing practice because a critical link exists between effective communication and positive patient outcomes. Nurses must communicate effectively with all members of the health-care team, including other nurses, the patient, and the patient's family (American Association of Col-leges of Nursing [AACN], 2008). Effective communication involves two distinctsteps: first, adequately articulating ideas; and second, understanding the listeningaudience with whom one is communicating (Rosenblatt & Davis, 2009). LEARNING OUTCOMES Discuss the importance of effective communication to safe and quality patient care. Identify strategies nurse leaders and managers can use to facilitate effectivecommunication. Describe the communication process. Define verbal and nonverbal communication, and explain why both areneeded for effective communication. Explain the importance of practicing active listening. Define factors that impact communication. Compare and contrast informal and formal communication, and identifyappropriate use of each. Delineate among organizational communication, interprofessional communication, and intraprofessional communication.KEY communication is accurate and timely, enhances quality of care, and fosters a healthy work environment. Mastering the art of communication seems simple because communicating is something people do every day. However, theintricacies of effective communication, such as knowing when communication isblocked or ineffective and registering nonverbal cues, must be studied and prac-ticed. This chapter illustrates communication basics, details the elements of effectivecommunication, and describes the three most common types of communicationused in nursing: organizational, interprofessional, and intraprofessional. Knowledge, skills, and attitudes related to the following core competencies are included in this chapter: patient-centered care and teamwork and collaboration. WHY EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION IS CRITICAL Nurses must be as proficient in communication skills as they are in clinical skills(American Association of Critical-Care Nurses, 2016). In fact, effective communication is as critical to clinical practice as it is to building interprofessional and intrapro-fessional teams, and it is a key element of successful nursing leadership. Effective communication is also vital to each Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN) core competency, particularly patient-centered care, team-work and collaboration, and safety (Cronenwett et al., 2007). To achieve patient-centered care, nurses must effectively communicate with patients and theirfamilies to ensure that patients can make informed decisions and participatefully in their care. Teamwork and collaboration require nurses to be competentin communication skills to function productively on interprofessional and in-traprofessional teams. Most importantly, nurses must understand that ineffectivecommunication, in the form of miscommunication and gaps in communication,can lead to medical errors that jeopardize patient safety. In fact, The Joint Com-mission (TJC, 2014) cites communication errors as a leading root cause of sentinelevents. In 2004, VitalSmarts, in partnership with the American Association of Critical- Care Nurses, conducted a nationwide study to explore specific concerns of health-care professionals related to communication that may contribute to avoidable errors(Maxwell, Grenny, McMillan, Patterson, & Switzler, 2005). The investigators iden-tified seven crucial conversations that health-care professionals frequently fail tohave that could add to unacceptable error rates. The lack of these crucial conversa-tions is still prevalent today, and the conversations relate to \"medical errors, patientsafety, quality of care, staff commitment, employee satisfaction, discretionary effort,and turnover\" (Maxwell et al., 2005, p. 2). The researchers conducted focus groupsand interviews and collected survey data from more than 1,700 participants. Theareas of concern identified were broken rules, mistakes, lack of support, incompe-tence, poor teamwork, disrespect, and micromanagement. Although more than halfof the health-care professionals surveyed witnessed colleagues cutting corners anddemonstrating incompetent practice in these areas, only 1 in 10 discussed their concerns with the coworker. Further, most surveyed did not believe it was their responsibility to address these concerns. The three primary reasons health-care professionals do not speak up regarding their concerns were identified as a person's lack of ability, belief that it was not hisChapter 6 Effective Communication 119 3021_Ch06_118-140 14/01/17 3:54 PM Page 119or her responsibility, and low confidence that speaking up would result in any good. Interestingly, the researchers identified a minority of 5% to 15% of health-care pro-fessionals who did speak up and noted a significant correlation that indicates thathealth-care professionals \"who are confident in their ability to have crucial conver-sations achieve positive outcomes for their patients, for the hospitals, and for them-selves\" (Maxwell et al., 2005, p. 7). In contrast, when health-care professionals donot speak up and address their concerns, morale and productivity suffer, and patientsafety is compromised (Maxwell et al., 2005). The investigators urged health-careorganizations to create cultures of safety in which all employees feel comfortableapproaching each other about concerns. Such an environment will improve produc-tivity, reduce nursing turnover, and increase physician cooperation. Nurses at all levels must communicate effectively in all areas of practice (American Nurses Association [ANA], 2016). However, nurse leaders and managers have an obligation to promote effective communication in the workplace and, essentially,must model effective communication for staff. In fact, nurse managers spend morethan 80% of their time communicating (Roussel & Swansburg, 2013). Characteristicsof effective communicators include respecting what others have to say, having empathy, listening actively, avoiding sarcasm, asking not commanding, avoidingtalking down or up to others, and encouraging input from others (Smith, 2011). Facilitating effective communication and teamwork and ensuring that nurses arecompetent in communication skills are the responsibilities of nurse managers andleaders (Timmins, 2011). Nurse leaders and managers can significantly influencethe use of effective communication by the following (Huston, 2014): Being effective communicators and role models themselves in all settings Establishing and upholding administrative structures to support and require effective communication and teamwork Effectively confronting and managing conflicts that arise from poor communication A nurse leader and manager who is a role model for good communication skills can provide staff nurses with informal support and leadership, which ultimatelycreate positive work environments and improve nurses' confidence, motivation,and morale (Timmins, 2011). BASICS OF COMMUNICATION To succeed in communicating effectively, nurses first become experts in the basicsof communication. The following is a brief review of communication basics. The Communication Process The communication process includes the following elements (Adler & Proctor, 2014; Harkreader, Hogan, & Thobaben, 2007): Sender: The person who begins the transfer of information, thoughts, or ideas,and engages one or more other persons Encoding: The process the sender uses to transmit the message, including verbal language, voice inflection, and body language120 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch06_118-140 14/01/17 3:54 PM Page 120Message: The information or content the sender is transferring, which can be transmitted verbally, nonverbally, and in writing Sensory channel: The manner in which the message is sent, including visual (e.g., facial expressions, posture, and body language), auditory (e.g., spoken word), kinesthetic (e.g., touching and nonverbal communication), and electronic(e.g., media such as e-mail or text message) Receiver: The person or persons whom the sender intended to receive the message Decoding: The process of interpreting the message Feedback: Determines whether the message was received as intended; can be ver- bal and nonverbal and allows the sender to correct or clarify the message sentand verify the message was received accurately Figure 6-1 illustrates the basic model for communication.A fatal flaw in the communication process is overlooking the final step of feedback . As George Bernard Shaw once said, \"The greatest problem in communication is theillusion that it has taken place\" (Shaw, n.d.). Simply sending a message and believingit to be clear and therapeutic does not mean that the message was clear or therapeu-tic to the receiver. For instance, when communicating with a patient who is hearingimpaired, using the auditory channel only most likely will not result in effectivecommunication. Because the receiver must be able to decode the information the sender is transmitting, a hearing-impaired patient would benefit more from thevisual channel than from the auditory channel. Nurses should never assume thatthey have communicated effectively until they have verified through feedback that the receiver clearly understood the message. Verbal and Nonverbal Communication People communicate using a combination of verbal language, or the use of wordsto convey messages by speaking or writing, and nonverbal cues, such as gestures,facial expressions, eye contact, posture, and use of space. Effective communicationresults when verbal and nonverbal messages are congruent. Verbal Communication Verbal communication is a conscious method of communication (Blais & Hayes, 2011; Harkreader et al., 2007). It occurs face to face, by telephone, and through writtenChapter 6 Effective Communication 121 Sender Encoding Decoding Receiver Message Feedback Figure 6-1 The communication process.3021_Ch06_118-140 14/01/17 3:54 PM Page 121messages such as e-mails and memos. The average person uses approximately 20,000 words in an average day to communicate with others (Schuster & Nykolyn,2010). Unfortunately, not all words have the same meaning for everyone, be it because someone speaks English as a second language or someone speaks Englishbut in another part of the world. To communicate effectively, selecting words that are clear and avoiding ambiguous messages are best, as is seeking feedback to ensure that the message was received with the intended meaning (Schuster & Nykolyn, 2010). Effective communication, whether spoken or written, is essential for nurses when dealing with patients, especially when documenting nursing care and pro-viding discharge instructions for patients and families. Precise documentation ofnursing care is vital because it is used by other nurses and health-care professionalsand in administrative records across an organization (ANA, 2010). Clear and un-derstandable discharge instructions can make the difference between a patient'scomplete recovery and a repeat visit to the hospital. For nurse leaders and managers, communicating verbally with staff in an effective matter is also critical. Nurse leaders and managers must convey clearly,typically in writing, information that is important for employees to know, such aspolicies and procedures and performance evaluations. When communicatingthrough memos, e-mail, and faxes, nurse leaders and managers must write profes-sionally and use easily understandable language (Marquis & Huston, 2015). Withwritten communication particularly, clarity is important because feedback is typi-cally not immediate, and it may be some time before nurse leaders and managersare able to address questions and concerns. Regardless of the purpose, effective writ-ten communication must contain language and terminology appropriate to the partyor parties being addressed; correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation; logical organization; and appropriate use and citation of references (Blais & Hayes, 2011). Nonverbal Communication Even in moments of silence, communication continues. Nonverbal communication encompasses behaviors, actions, and facial expressions that transmit messages inlieu of or in addition to verbal communication. Nonverbal communication plays acentral role in human interactions and is crucial in transmitting emotional and relational information (Henry, Fuhrel-Forbis, Rogers, & Eggly, 2012). Nonverbalcommunication can be conscious as well as subconscious and includes eye contact,facial expressions, gestures, posture, body movement, touch, and physical appear-ance. Facial behavior and expressions in particular (e.g., eye contact or lack of, smiling or grimacing) provide valuable clues and can indicate a person's comfortlevel with the topic under discussion. Beyond paying attention to the receiver's nonverbal cues, the speaker must be aware of his or her own body language because it must match the verbal messagebeing sent. Consider a staff nurse who approaches the nurse leader and managerand asks whether he or she has a few minutes to discuss a patient situation. Thenurse leader and manager says \"sure\" but proceeds to continually look at his orher watch, and hence the verbal message sent to the staff nurse is incongruent withthe nonverbal message. In addition, nonverbal communication alone can have great122 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch06_118-140 14/01/17 3:54 PM Page 122impact. Sometimes the mere presence of the nurse manager on the unit sends a message to staff, \"I am interested in what is going on here.\" Never underestimatethe power of nonverbal communication. Active Listening Effective communication requires the ability to listen actively (ANA, 2015). Hearingand listening are two different things: Hearing is the physiological process of soundcommunicating with the hearing apparatus, whereas listening is more active andparticipatory (Rebair, 2012) and requires energy and a high level of concentration(Weaver, 2010). Active listening is broken down into five stages (Rebair, 2012): 1.Receiving: Ensuring the nurse is in a good position to hear information clearly 2.Attending: Engaging in the conversation by adopting positive body language, facial expressions, and gestures 3.Understanding: Gaining an understanding of what is being said and what may not be said 4.Responding: Responding to the patient in a nonjudgmental manner and being aware if anything may have upset him or her 5.Remembering: Recalling previous conversations with the patient to establish a starting point when re-engaging Active listening also requires the nurse to put aside judgment, evaluation, and approval in a concerted effort to be aware of the emotions and attitudes of others (Weaver, 2010). Although nurses are often the senders of messages in the communication process, they also need to practice attentive listening skills to achieve effectivecommunication. Without active listening, a nurse will not be able to determine thepatient's perspective and consequently provide safe and quality nursing care.Nurses should take as many opportunities as possible to be the receiver, by focus-ing on adopting body language, facial expressions, and gestures that are positiveand relay to the sender that they are engaged in the conversation (e.g., being eyelevel with the patient, positioning the body so it is squarely in front of him or her), as well as reducing or blocking out distractions (Rebair, 2012). Respondingappropriately to the information communicated is also necessary and can be accomplished by reflecting back to the person (e.g., \"I heard you say . . .\") or requesting clarification for something that was not understood (e.g., \"I'm not sureI understand . . .\") (Beach, 2010; Rebair, 2012). Actively listening to staff as well as patients is also important. To have a satisfied and productive staff, nurse leaders and managers must hear what employees aresaying as well as what they are not saying. A nurse leader who actively listens em-powers staff, provides information that facilitates work and quality improvement,and speeds up problem solving and decision making (Roussel & Swansburg, 2013).Whether communicating with patients or staff, nurse leaders and managers wholisten to and remember what others says gain rapport and trust for future encoun-ters. \"When trust is high, communication is easy, effortless, instantaneous, and accurate. . . . When trust is low, communication is extremely difficult, exhausting,and ineffective\" (Covey, 1991, p. 138). Chapter 6 Effective Communication 123 3021_Ch06_118-140 14/01/17 3:54 PM Page 123FACTORS THAT IMPACT COMMUNICATION When the message the sender transmits is what the receiver understands, clear and effective communication has taken place. However, elements that alter or affectcommunication can occur at any time during the process. Nurse leaders and managers must be aware of factors that can interfere with message transmission, including gender, generation, values and perceptions, personal space, environment,and roles and relationships. Gender Men and women commonly communicate differently: Typically, men tend to be as-sertive and more verbal, whereas women are more likely to collaborative and usenonverbal cues and metaphors (Marquis & Huston, 2015). In addition, men tendto talk more, disagree more, and focus on the issue rather than the person, whereaswomen overuse descriptive statements and qualifiers and more often relate per-sonal experiences (Sullivan, 2012). Nurse leaders and managers can bridge the gen-der gap by using gender-neutral language in all communication methods and beingaware of how their own gender affects their communication style. Generation The nursing workforce is comprised of individuals spanning four different gener-ations: veterans (1922 to 1945), baby boomers (1946 to 1964), generation X (1965 to1981), and generation Y (1982 to 1999) (Murray, 2013). Each generation comes withits own unique characteristics, values, work ethic, communication style, and expectations of a work environment (Murray, 2013; Strauss & Howe, 1991). Nurseleaders and managers must identify and implement various communication strate-gies to reach all generations. For example, baby boomers prefer personal forms ofcommunication, whereas generations X and Y are more comfortable with technol-ogy and favor electronic forms of communication. Culture A person's culture can influence communication in many ways, whether becauseof the native language of the culture or because of verbal and nonverbal behaviorvariations. Nurse leaders and managers must be attentive to cultural differencesin employees. In one study, health-care professionals identified the ability to adjustlanguage, whether verbal or nonverbal, to the target audience as an important com-munication skill, whether communicating with patients and families or workingin interprofessional and intraprofessional teams (Suter et al., 2009). Values and Perceptions One's own values and perceptions influence how one communicates. Patients, fam-ilies, and other nurses may encode, send, receive, decode, and interpret messagesdifferently based on their own value systems, life experiences, and worldviews.124 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch06_118-140 14/01/17 3:54 PM Page 124Nurse leaders and managers must consider differences in values and perceptions when communicating with patients, families, health-care providers, peers, andmanagers to avoid miscommunication and misunderstandings. Personal Space Personal space, or the space between parties when communication takes place, alsoinfluences communication. What one individual considers appropriate personalspace, an amount that feels comfortable and safe, can differ dramatically from an-other person's view (Hall, 1990; McLaughlin, Olson, & White, 2008). However, thereare commonly accepted parameters for distance between persons communicating,depending on the situation. Environment Environment plays a major role in whether communication is effective, staff is pro-ductive, and teamwork is collaborative. Nurse leaders and managers should striveto create an environment that supports communication as a two-way dialogue inwhich people think and make decisions together and with minimal distractions(American Association of Critical-Care Nurses, 2016). A supportive environment suchas this allows patients and families to feel comfortable enough to share information,ask questions, and offer opinions. In addition, a healthy environment ensures thatstaff members feel more comfortable sharing ideas, asking questions, and offeringsolutions to problems. In contrast, a negative or unhealthy environment promotesone-way communication and a sense that staff and patients have little power. Roles and Relationships A nurse's role and his or her relationships with others influence the communicationprocess. Roles can influence the words people choose, their tone of voice, commu-nication channel, and body language (Blais & Hayes, 2011). For example, nursesmay choose a face-to-face method when communicating with patients and familiesbut may use the telephone to communicate with health-care providers. Nurse lead-ers and managers often use a face-to-face method to communicate sensitive infor-mation to staff and e-mail to communicate policy changes. To be an effective communicator, nurse leaders and managers must also adapt their communication style based on the ability of the individual\u2014whether a patient,family member, or staff member\u2014to process and comprehend the interaction(Smith, 2011). Often, noise occurs during transmission (Fig. 6-2). Noise comprisesthe physical and/or psychological forces that can disrupt effective communication.Physical noise includes conspicuous environmental distractions, such as excessivesounds, activity, physical separation, and interruptions, that interfere with a per-son's ability to listen actively. Psychological noise includes internal distractions,such as one's values, stress and anxiety levels, emotions, and judgments, that impede his or her ability to send or receive a message clearly. Nurse leaders and managers can prevent physical noise by creating a supportive environment with as few distractions as possible, as described earlier. PsychologicalChapter 6 Effective Communication 125 3021_Ch06_118-140 14/01/17 3:54 PM Page 125noise can be reduced by encouraging staff to employ empathy for the patient. Phys- ical touch and caring nonverbal cues also can help establish a calm atmosphere fora patient and his or her family. 126 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND LEARNING ACTIVITY 6-1 Reflect on a Recent Communication Interaction Think about a recent interaction you had or observed that resulted in miscommunication. Consider the following: 1. Were verbal communication and nonverbal communication congruent? 2. What factors may have affected communication (e.g., gender, generations, culture, values, environment)? 3. Could there have been physiological or psychological noise? FORMAL AND INFORMAL COMMUNICATION Communication in health care occurs along two different channels: formal and informal. Formal communication is described as \"a type of verbal presentation or docu- ment intended to share information and which conforms to established professionalrules, standards and processes and avoids using slang terminology\" (\"Formal com-munication,\" 2014). Formal communication follows the line of authority in an orga-nizational hierarchy (Marquis & Huston, 2015), and it also reflects the culture of the organization; communication is planned rather than allowed to occur randomly(Triolo, 2012). Examples of formal communication that nurse leaders and managersmay use include interviewing, counseling, dealing with complaints, managing con-flict, evaluating, and disciplining (Sullivan, 2012). During the formal communicationprocess, it is critical for nurse leaders and managers to maintain professionalism andbe effective communicators by: Using plain, direct language and avoiding jargon Using familiar illustrations to get points across Listening objectively Keeping questions short Giving clear, concise direction or instructions FeedbackSender EncodingNoise Noise NoiseNoise Decoding Receiver Message Figure 6-2 process with noise.3021_Ch06_118-140 14/01/17 3:54 PM Page 126Seeking frequent feedback Providing frequent feedback On the other end of the spectrum, informal communication occurs among staff members at the same or different level in an organization with no formal lines of authority or responsibility (Marquis & Huston, 2015). Informal communication is a \"casual form of information sharing typically used in personal conversations withfriends or family members\" (\"Informal communication,\" 2014). Nurse leaders andmanagers may use informal communication when conversing with patients aboutpersonal business, such as children or pets. Informal communication is used fornurse managers and leaders to establish open lines of communication with staffand to create a culture in the workplace that allows employees to feel connectedwith each other (Parboteeah et al., 2010). One negative example of informal communication is the grapevine. Grapevine com- munication flows quickly and haphazardly at all levels of the organization and becomes more and more distorted as it moves along (Phillips, 2007). Communication on thegrapevine travels in multiple directions at a rapid speed and carries both positive andnegative information. Misinformation can run rampant, thus causing low morale anddecreased productivity. Nurse leaders and managers must monitor the grapevine andintervene quickly to provide accurate information to avert unrest and job dissatisfac-tion among employees. Employees prefer regular communication from nurse leadersand managers, rather than hearing information through the grapevine (Triolo, 2012).To prevent grapevine communication, nurse leaders and managers must share asmuch information as possible with staff; the only information that should not beshared is information protected by law and ethics (Roussel & Swansburg, 2013). TYPES OF COMMUNICATION IN A HEALTH-CARE ENVIRONMENT Three types of communication come into play in a health-care work environment:organizational, interprofessional, and intraprofessional. Nurse must understandand be able to apply all three when communicating. Organizational Communication Health-care systems must communicate important information, such as regulations,policies, and procedures. The goal of organizational communication is to convey the same message across the entire system. The ease with which communication flowsthrough an organization has a great impact on the individual employee because itsets the tone for the climate of the working environment (Parboteeah et al., 2010). Infact, lack of effective communication at the organizational level can result in conflictand poor adherence to guidelines (Parboteeah et al., 2010; Pavlakis et al., 2011). Various directions of communication may be used at the organizational level. Downward communication reflects the hierarchical nature of the organization (e.g., the sending of information by administrators to nurse leaders and managers or by nurse leaders and managers to staff). Downward communication includes directives to employees, expectations for employees, and performance feedback(Phillips, 2007; Sullivan, 2012).Chapter 6 Effective Communication 127 3021_Ch06_118-140 14/01/17 3:54 PM Page 127Lateral communication is the sharing of information among nurse leaders and managers or other staff at the same level. Examples of lateral communication are coordination between units and services, information sharing, problem solving,and conflict management (Phillips, 2007). Communication with others in the organization who are not on the same level in the hierarchy is considered diagonal communication . This occurs, for example, when a nurse leader and manager communicates with the chief financial officer or themedical director (Phillips, 2007). Finally, upward communication is the sending of information up the hierarchal chain (e.g., staff to the nurse manager or leader, or nurse leader and manager to higher-level managers and administrators). Common instances of upward communicationare requests for resources, sharing ideas or suggestions for improvement, and employee grievances (Phillips, 2007; Sullivan, 2012). Organizational communication occurs in staff meetings, group discussions, com- mittee meetings, and in-service education. Written communication is by far themost common form of organizational communication used (Parboteeah et al., 2010).E-mail, faxes, and bulletins posted in high-traffic areas are common forms of organizational written communication. Interprofessional Communication According to the AACN (2008), interprofessional refers to \"working across healthcareprofessions to cooperate, collaborate, communicate, and integrate care in teams to en-sure that care is continuous and reliable\" (p. 37). Effective interprofessional communication fosters patient-centered care and results in quality outcomes. To communicate inter-professionally, nurse leaders and managers must communicate with all members ofthe health-care team, as well as with patients and their families. The InterprofessionalEducation Collaborative Expert Panel (2011) identified communication as one of fourcompetencies for interprofessional collaborative practice; the specific interprofessionalcommunication competencies are listed in Box 6-1. Failure to effectively communicate interprofessionally has been found to be a significant contributing factor associated with many preventable medical errors(Stevens, Bader, Luna, & Johnson, 2011). In fact, evidence suggests that poor inter-professional communication impacts patient safety and quality of care globally.The World Health Organization (2008) identified the lack of communication andcoordination as the number one research priority in developed countries and thenumber three research priority in countries in transition. Specifically, miscommunication between nurses and physicians contributes to med- ication errors, patient injuries, and patient deaths (Kesten, 2011). Part of the challengein combating interprofessional miscommunication between nurses and physicians isthat styles differ between the two disciplines: Nurses are taught to be more descriptive,whereas physicians are taught to communicate in a more concise manner (Thomas,Bertram, & Johnson, 2009). In addition, some traditional health-care environmentsoften support a culture in which nurses are intimidated by physicians, thus leadingto delays in sharing important medical information. Communication between nursesand physicians should be timely, accurate, complete, and unambiguous for care to be128 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch06_118-140 14/01/17 3:54 PM Page 128safe and effective. Effective communication among all health-care professionals is a worldwide goal today (Mitchell, Groves, Mitchell, & Batkin, 2010). Common strategies that enhance and promote interprofessional communication include team rounding, TeamSTEPPS, and SBAR. Interprofessional Team Rounding One strategy that is enhancing communication among health-care professionals,producing quality outcomes, increasing patient satisfaction, reducing error rates,and improving patient safety is interprofessional team rounding (Baldwin, Wittenberg- Lyles, Oliver, & Demiris, 2011). As the coordinator of care, the nurse possesses themajority of information that is valuable to the health-care team. With interprofes-sional team rounding, key members of the interprofessional team gather at specifiedtimes to discuss the progress of the patient's plan of care. The patient and his or herfamily have the opportunity to meet with all members of the health-care team aswell. Each member of the interprofessional team, including the patient and his orher family, contributes during team rounding to provide individual expertise to aholistic plan of care. For example, during interprofessional team rounding, the patient's bedside nurse ensures that patient information is current and available forthe meeting and offers the team insight into care issues, with the goals of advocatingfor the patient and respectfully communicating the patient's wishes to the health-care team (Weaver, 2010). After team rounding, nurse leaders and managers are responsible for communicating the outcome of the interprofessional team round toany members not present and for communicating feedback to the team as needed. Chapter 6 Effective Communication 129 BOX 6-1BOX 6-1 Interprofessional Communication CompetenciesInterprofessional Communication Competencies GENERAL COMPETENCY STATEMENT Communicate with patients, families, communities, and other health professionals in a responsive and responsible manner that supports a team approach to the maintenance of health and the treatment of disease. Specific interprofessional communicationcompetencies: 1.Choose effective communication tools and tech- niques, including information systems and commu-nication technologies, to facilitate discussions andinteractions that enhance team function. 2.Organize and communicate information with patients, families, and health-care team membersin a form that is understandable, and avoid discipline-specific terminology when possible. 3.Express one's knowledge and opinions to teammembers involved in patient care with confidence,clarity, and respect, and work to ensure commonunderstanding of information and treatment andcare decisions. 4.Listen actively, and encourage ideas and opinionsof other team members. 5.Give timely, sensitive, instructive feedback to othersabout their performance on the team, and respondrespectfully as a team member to feedback fromothers. 6.Use respectful language appropriate for a given difficult situation, crucial conversation, or interpro-fessional conflict. 7.Recognize how one's own uniqueness, includingexperience level, expertise, culture, power, and hierarchy within the health-care team, contributesto effective communication, conflict resolution, andpositive interprofessional working relationships. 8.Communicate consistently the importance of teamwork in patient-centered and community-focused care. From Interprofessional Education Collaborative Expert Panel, 2011, p. with permission.3021_Ch06_118-140 14/01/17 3:54 PM Page 129TeamSTEPPS TeamSTEPPS , or Team Strategies and Tools to Enhance Performance and Patient Safety, is an evidence-based teamwork system developed by the U.S. Department of Defense in collaboration with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality(AHRQ) that is aimed at optimizing patient safety outcomes by improving com-munication and teamwork skills among health-care professionals (AHRQ, n.d.).One of the competencies covered by TeamSTEPPS is positive and conflict-free com-munication as a requirement for effective teamwork. The focus of TeamSTEPPS isconcise information exchange techniques, including the Sherman & Eggenberger, 2009): Two-challenge rule: Requires the nurse to voice concerns at least twice to receive ac- knowledgment from another interprofessional team member. The two-challengerule is used when a standard of care is not followed. If the team member does notacknowledge the concern being challenged, the nurse takes stronger action or fol-lows the hospital chain of command. Nurse leaders and managers use this tech-nique when dealing with team members who do not follow policies. Call out: Simultaneously informs team members of important information and assigns tasks during a critical event or situation. Nurse leaders and managersuse this technique when an emergency situation arises on the unit (e.g., respira-tory arrest). Check-back: Requires the nurse to use closed-loop communication and verify that the information that is being received is correct. Nurse leaders and managers usethis technique when assigning care to staff or when clarifying a change in treat-ment or medications. SBAR SBAR , or Situation-Background-Assessment-Recommendation, is a communication tool meant to simplify communication by framing it in the following manner (Institute for Healthcare Improvement, 2014): S = Situation (a concise statement of the problem) B = Background (pertinent and brief information related to the situation) A = Assessment (analysis and considerations of options\u2014what the nurse found or thinks) R = Recommendation (action requested/recommended\u2014what the nurse wants) The SBAR communication tool is an effective method for improving communi- cation within the interdisciplinary health-care team because it assists team membersin organizing and prioritizing their thoughts before communicating with otherhealth-care professionals. It fosters improved critical thinking and professionalcommunication skills by developing a brief synopsis of the reason for the contactbetween providers through an organized and predictable format. When used prop-erly, SBAR allows for an assertive dialogue, the precise relay of crucial information,and an increased situational awareness that can greatly enhance safe delivery ofpatient care by setting expectations for the information communicated and for howinformation is delivered (Stevens et al., 2011). Table 6-1 illustrates the SBAR tool130 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND 3021_Ch06_118-140 14/01/17 3:54 PM Page 130and examples of statements nurses can use to relay information and recommenda- tions to the health-care provider. By enabling the continuous and collaborative exchange of information pertaining to patient care throughout the care environment, the SBAR tool increases the satis-faction level of nurses, physicians, and patients while improving the safety of thecare being delivered. In fact, SBAR can effectively decrease the rate and frequencyof medical errors associated with miscommunication among health-care providers.Teamwork is crucial to the delivery of safe and effective high-quality patient care,and SBAR has been shown to build teamwork and strengthen working relationshipsamong health-care providers. Moreover, it can facilitate proficient communicationand continuity during the transfer of care among nurses, levels of acuity, or otherorganizations (Thomas, Bertram, & Johnson, 2009). It also allows the nurse to expresschanges in patient status successfully and leaves little room for missed or inaccurateinformation being relayed, thereby leading to an increased level of safety and thequality of care given. Research has shown that when SBAR is used, patients havereported an enriched atmosphere of patient protection within the hospital setting(Beckett & Kipnis, 2009). Nurses use SBAR during patient care and shift reports andto communicate an unexpected change in a patient's condition. SBAR has been Chapter 6 Effective Communication 131 S = Situation B = Background A = Assessment R = RecommendationSpecifics to report: Identify self, unit, patient, room number Briefly state problem, when it happened, how severe \"I am concerned about . . .\" Specifics to report could include: Current medications, allergies Recent laboratory results Most recent vital signs Code status Other clinical information Possible phrases: \"I think the problem is . . .\" \"I am not sure what the problem is, but thepatient is getting worse . . .\" Recommendations could include: \"I request that you [say what you want done]: Come into see the patient Talk to family about code status Transfer the patient to the intensive careunitICU If change in treatment, be sure to ask: How often do you want vital signs? When do you want me to call again? Table 6-1 SBAR Tool Based on SBAR Tool developed by Kaiser Permanente (Institute for Healthcare Improvement, 2014).The nurse describes the problem and why he or sheis calling. The nurse provides pertinent information related to thesituation (i.e., the clinicalfacts). The nurse provides an analysis of the situation (i.e.,what he or she thinks theproblem is). The nurse makes recom- mendation(s) (i.e., what heor she believes will resolvethe situation or problem).3021_Ch06_118-140 14/01/17 3:54 PM Page 131132 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND Donahue, M., Miller, M., Smith, L., Dykes, D., & Fitzpatrick, J.

Aim This study had three goals: 1) translation of SBAR for paraprofessionals, 2) reduc-tion of cultural and educational barriers to interprofessional communication, and 3) examination of the Educating and Mentoring Paraprofessionals on Ways to Enhance Reporting (EMPOWER) intervention on barriers to interpersonal communication practices and perceptions of a safety culture using SBAR. Methods The project was implemented in two phases. The first phase focused on surveyingparaprofessional staff members to establish baseline measures related to patientsafety culture. The second phase focused on validation, testing of the EMPOWERtraining module, and recommendations for improving the safety culture by using SBAR. Key Findings The evaluation of the EMPOWER project focused on effectiveness of the SBARtraining for paraprofessionals and reinforcement of SBAR training among all staff members. Initial surveys were conducted among 280 paraprofessionals, and 182 completed the survey. As part of the project, the leadership team beganmaking rounds throughout the hospital to ensure that staff members understoodtheir commitment to a culture of safety. After implementation of the EMPOWERproject, surveys were conducted again and were compared with the first survey.The following key changes were revealed: In the first survey, 33% of the paraprofessionals indicated that when a patient safety event was reported, it felt as if the person was being written up rather than the problem; in the second survey, this percentage dropped to 21.7%. In the first survey, 78% of the paraprofessionals indicated that hospital manage-ment felt that patient safety was a top priority; in the second survey, this per-centage increased to 86%. The use of SBAR by paraprofessionals increased from 74% at the end of the EMPOWER project to 90% after 1 year. Implications for Nurse Leaders and Managers Nurse leaders and managers can learn from this project the importance of recog-nizing paraprofessionals as members of the interprofessional team. The results ofthis study further promote the value of SBAR as an effective tool for increasingteam communication and a standard for enhancing a culture of safety. EXPLORING THE EVIDENCE 6-13021_Ch06_118-140 14/01/17 3:54 PM Page 132applied in many settings, including high-risk departments such as intensive care, emergency departments, and operating rooms, and has yielded improved satisfac-tion of patients and care providers, enhanced quality of clinical outcomes, improvedcommunication among interprofessional team members, and an increase in thesafety of the delivery of patient care (Kesten, 2011). The SBAR technique can also be used to address nonclinical, management issues, such as workload and staffing levels. In one example, staff nurses on a rehabilitationunit used the technique to present poor staffing and workload issues to manage-ment. The tool provided them with a mechanism to present the issues along withrecommendations for improvement in a professional manner (Boaro, Fancott,Baker, Velji, & Andreoli, 2010). Chapter 6 Effective Communication 133 LEARNING ACTIVITY 6-2 Case Study Using SBAR Tracey is a registered nurse caring for a 70-year-old female patient who returned from recovery after abdominal surgery approximately 4 hours ago. On admission to Tracey's unit, the patient's blood pressure was128/80 and pulse was 86. One hour after admission, the patient complained ofpain and indicated that her pain was 8 on a scale of zero to 10. At that time, herabdomen was firm and tender without bowel sounds, and her blood pressure was110/68 with a pulse of 98. Tracey medicated the patient for pain. Two hours afteradmission, the patient continues to complain of abdominal pain and says \"It's theworse pain I've ever had.\" Her abdomen continues to be firm and tender withoutbowel sounds. Her blood pressure is now 90/60, and her pulse is 110. Tracey decides to contact the health-care provider. Using the SBAR tool in Table 6-1, indicate what Tracey should communicate to the health-care provider. S = Situation: B = Background:A = Assessment:R = Recommendation: Intraprofessional Communication Intraprofessional means \"working with healthcare team members within the pro- fession to ensure that care is continuous and reliable\" (AACN, 2008, p.38). Fornurses, intraprofessional communication means working with other nursing staff to deliver safe and quality patient care. In the Principles for Collaborative Relation-ships Between Clinical Nurses and Nurse Managers developed by the ANA and the American Organization of Nurse Executives (AONE) (ANA and AONE, 2012), onefocus is effective communication. The principles of effective communication canbridge the \"us versus them\" divide often prevalent between nursing managementand staff (ANA and AONE, 2012). The principles related to effective intraprofes-sional communication are listed in Box 6-2. 3021_Ch06_118-140 14/01/17 3:54 PM Page 133Nurse-to-Nurse Transitions in Care Health-care organizations have found how important it is to standardize nurse- to-nurse transitions in care. At one time commonly referred to as a handoff and more recently termed a handover to reflect more accurately the two-sided process (Barnsteiner, 2012), these transitions in care occur when a patient is transferredfrom one unit to another, when a nurse must accompany one patient to a proce-dure and leave other patients under the care of another nurse, when a nurse takesa break for lunch, and when there is a change of shift (Chen, Wright, Smith, Jaggers,& Mistry, 2011; Griffin, 2010). The purpose of the nurse-to-nurse handover is toacquaint a nurse who has not cared for the patient with the patient's needs andcondition; to provide an opportunity for education on unfamiliar medications,equipment, and the care process; and to acquaint the nurse with the patient andnot just the tasks (Griffin, 2010). The handover of patient care from one nurse toanother requires effective communication to avoid negative consequences for patients (Barnsteiner, 2012). Handovers also transfer accountability and responsi-bility from one nurse to another (Griffin, 2010). Nurse-to-nurse handovers vary with each facility. For example, handovers in the acute care setting look very different from those in an outpatient care environ-ment. Handovers may also vary from unit to unit in inpatient settings, althoughinpatient care facilities have begun standardizing handovers to reduce errors (Chenet al., 2011; Griffin, 2010). Reports on handovers may be verbal or written and givenin an individual or group format. Many health-care institutions are deciding to\"bring report to the bedside\" in an effort to improve patient satisfaction and reducemedical errors because studies show that increasing patient involvement reduceserrors in communication and the continuum of care (Griffin, 2010). The Institutefor Patient- and Family-Centered Care (2011, para 1) identified four concepts thatapply during nurse-to-nurse handovers, specifically if given at the bedside: 1.Respect and dignity: Nurses must understand and respect the choices of patients and families and honor perspectives. The nurse must clearly communicate those perspectives and choices that directly affect care choices and help to create mean-ingful partnerships among patient, family, and nursing staff. 2.Information sharing: Accurate and unbiased information regarding care choices and plan of care must be shared with patients and families to include them in the care process. Information sharing at the time of nurse-to-nurse report, 134 PART I FOUNDATIONS AND BACKGROUND BOX 6-2BOX 6-2 American Nurses Association and AmericanAmerican Nurses Association and American Organization of Nurse Executives Principles ofOrganization of Nurse Executives Principles of Collaborative Relationships: Effective Communication Collaborative Relationships: Effective Communication 1.Engage in active listening to fully understand and contemplate what is being relayed. 2.Know the intent of a message, as well as the purpose and expectations of that message. 3.Foster an open, safe environment. 4.Whether giving or receiving information, be sure itis accurate. 5.Have people speak to the person they need to speak to, so the right person gets the right information.

Participation must be outlined by the competent adultpatient and may vary from day to day based upon the emotional and physicalwell-being of each party. Staggers, N., & Blaz, J. W. (2013). Research on nursing handoffs for medical and surgical settings: An integrative review. Journal of Advanced Nursing, 69(2), 247-262. Aim The aim of this integrated review was to synthesize outcomes from research ofnursing handoffs on medical surgical units to guide future computerization of the handoff process. Methods The investigators conducted an integrated literature review of studies publishedin peer-reviewed nursing journals between 1980 and March 2011. Studies aboutnurses' perceptions and informal reports were excluded from the review. Thesearch yielded 247 references, of which 62 were duplicates. The references werereviewed and rated for relevance. The studies were classified as relevant, not relevant, or questionable. A total of 81 studies were retrieved by the investigatorsfor additional review and classification. The final sample included 30 researchstudies (20 qualitative, four experimental, and six descriptive). Key Findings All studies examined handoffs from the nursing perspective except two, which tracedpatient-centered handoffs across hospitalizations. One-third of the studies reviewedfound issues with information effectiveness, accuracy, and efficiency. All studies revealed that handoffs are complex processes. Researchers found that structured formats tailored to individual medical and surgical units improved information completeness. The investigators noted that most studies did not address the contextof handoffs, even though context is critical to the computerization of the handoffprocess. The investigators found that the current trend of bedside face-to-face hand-offs in medical and surgical units was not supported in the studies reviewed. In addition, no findings reflected the patient's perspective, which can have implica-tions for the accuracy of information being relayed across units and settings. Implications for Nurse Leaders and Managers Nurse leaders and managers should be aware of these findings to assist in more effective relay of information during handoffs. In addition, the process of bedsidehandoffs that is common practice today in medical and surgical units is not sup-ported by the available evidence.EXPLORING THE EVIDENCE 6-23021_Ch06_118-140 14/01/17 3:54 PM Page 1354.Collaboration: Patients and family members may provide insights into the care process or report process that may be invaluable to future patients. Collaborating with patients and family members, not only regarding the care of the patient butalso in exploring how the process can be more patient centered, provides endlessresources to improving the process of including the patient at bedside report. Patient care handovers can result in important information gaps, omissions, errors, and harm to the patient (Staggers & Blaz, 2013). Potential causes of errors during handovers include the following (Chen et al., 2011, p. 380): Environmental distractions Simultaneous transfer of equipment and knowledge No previous information for the receiving nurse on the patient's history or con-dition, thereby creating a situation in which vast amounts of information areshared in a limited time Clinically unstable patients who require attention during handovers, thus result-ing in a limited time for reviewing medical history It is not possible to eliminate all of these causes for error during the handover process; for instance, if a patient requires care immediately, it must be given. How-ever, standardizing handovers may help to decrease confusion and errors. Whenthe receiving nurse is given information in a format that is familiar, such as SBAR,the information will not seem overwhelming. In addition, this approach providesa standard of care for what information is shared and reminds the nurse who isgiving report to furnish complete information on each point before moving ontothe next (Chen et al., 2011). SUMMARY Communication is one of the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that nurse leaders andmanagers\u2014and in fact all nurses\u2014must use with extreme proficiency. Communi-cating across the organization, among professionals, and among nurses is criticalfor safe and quality patient-centered care. Miscommunication is a source for errorthat could be potentially harmful to patients, so nurse leaders and managers mustgenuinely try to understand what others are saying, listen carefully, and maintaincomposure in difficult situations (Batcheller, 2007). Lack of effective communicationcan impact the health-care work environment and result in misinformation, misun-derstanding, fear, suspicion, insecurity, and job dissatisfaction, as well as compro-mise patient safety and quality of nursing care. Nurse leaders and managers whoare role models for good communication skills can provide staff nurses with infor-mal support and leadership, which ultimately create a positive work environmentand improve nurses' confidence, motivation, and morale (Timmins, 2011).

Since the Institute of Medicine's (IOM)groundbreaking report To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System was released in 2000, there has been tremendous movement toward decreasing errors and im-proving the safety and quality of health care (Kohn, Corrigan, & Donaldson, 2000).Two additional IOM reports in 2004, Patient Safety: Achieving a New Standard for Care(Aspden, Corrigan, Wolcott, & Erickson, 2004) and Keeping Patients Safe: Transform-ing the Work Environment of Nurses (Page, 2004), also brought significant attentionto the need to improve the safety and quality of the care delivered. However, patient safety issues present an ongoing threat to achieving quality health care, and despite significant achievements since the IOM reports were pub-lished, patients remain at risk of serious harm (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation,2014). In 2010, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported thatin a study of 780 Medicare beneficiaries, 13.5% experienced adverse events and13.5% experienced temporary harm events during hospitalization. Further inves-tigation revealed that at least 44% of the events were preventable. The IOM's esti-mate of 44,000 to 98,000 preventable medical errors per year has been challengedby a newer report that reviewed contemporary literature (published between 2006and 2012) to identify types and numbers of preventable adverse events in hospitals(James, 2013). The report's findings suggest that 210,000 to 400,000 deaths each yearin hospitals in the United States are associated with preventable adverse events. Improving safety and quality in health care is not just an issue in the United States; rather, it is a global public health concern. Close to 10% of patients hospital-ized in developed countries will fall victim to preventable errors or adverse events(World Health Organization [WHO], 2014a). In fact, patients are at higher risk ofinjury while hospitalized (1 in 300) than when flying on an airplane (1 in 1,000,000)(WHO, 2014a). As the largest group of health-care professionals\u2014as of 2014, there were 2,661,890 registered nurses in the workforce in the United States (Bureau of Labor Statistics,2014)\u2014nurses are in the key position to impact patient safety and quality care, andin fact they have an ethical obligation to promote safe and quality care. This obligationis reflected in Provision 3 of the ANA Code of Ethics for Nurses With Interpretive State- ments : \"The nurse promotes, advocates for, and protects the rights, health, and safety of the patient\" (American Nurses Association [ANA], 2015a, p. 9). Further, Provision4 states that \"nurses have vested authority, and are accountable and responsible forthe quality of their practice\" (p. 15). In addition, it is the mission of the InternationalCouncil of Nurses (ICN) \"to ensure quality nursing care for all and sound health poli-cies globally\" (2014, para. 1). The ICN also believes that nurses must ensure patientsafety in all aspects of care delivery. According to the ICN, promoting patient safety: involves a wide range of actions in the recruitment, training and retention of health care pro- fessionals, performance improvement, environmental safety and risk management, includinginfection control, safe use of medicines, equipment safety, safe clinical practice, safe environmentof care, and accumulating an integrated body of scientific knowledge focused on patient safetyand the infrastructure to support its development (ICN, 2012, para. 1).Chapter 7 Improving and Managing Safe and Quality Care 143 3021_Ch07_141-173 16/01/17 3:24 PM Page 143Although the nursing profession has an obligation to take the lead in the patient safety and quality movement, nurses need to do more than they have in past decades if there is to be progress (Johnson, 2012). This chapter presents an overview of the prevalence and types of medical errors in health care today and patient safety initiatives underway to addressthem. Further, it discusses the roles of nurses at all levels in ensuring patientsafety, from developing a culture of safety to standardizing processes, and improving patient safety, including using safety initiatives and incorporatingtools for quality improvement (QI). Knowledge, skills, and attitudes related to the following core competencies are included: patient-centered care, teamwork and collaboration, QI, and safety. MEDICAL ERRORS Health care is becoming more complex, and along with increased complexity comesthe growing problem of medical errors. The IOM defines a medical error as \"the failure of a planned action to be completed as intended (i.e., error of execution) or the use ofa wrong plan to achieve an aim (i.e., error in planning)\" (Kohn, Corrigan & Donaldson,2000, p. 28). An injury to a patient caused by medical management rather than the pa-tient's underlying condition is called an adverse event or a patient safety event (The Joint Commission [TJC], 2016a), and most of these events are preventable. Several highlypublicized cases of preventable medical errors spurred numerous initiatives to pro-mote patient safety and improvement of quality of care. Table 7-1 illustrates some ofthese incidents related to preventable errors and the policy outcomes that resulted. There are two types of errors: an error of omission and an error of commission. An error of omission results when an action is not taken or omitted, such as when a nurse does not assess a patient after surgery or does not administer a medication;in both situations, the nurse omitted an action that is a standard of care. An error of commission results when the wrong action is taken or committed. Examples of errors of commission include a nurse giving a medication to the wrong patient or per-forming a procedure incorrectly (e.g., a nurse breaking sterile technique when in-serting a Foley catheter). When an error occurs in the presence of a potential hazard, it is an unsafe act (Reason, 1990). Some unsafe acts do not result from errors but from violations. Aviolation is a deliberate deviation from safe practices as identified by designers,managers, and regulatory agencies to maintain a safe system (Reason, 1990). Forexample, a common standard of care is that nurses must check a patient's nameband before medication administration; neglecting to check a patient's name bandbefore administering medications is a violation. Errors and violations do not alwaysresult in harm or accidents. However, they have the potential to do so. Further, errors can be classified as slips, lapses, and mistakes (Reason, 1990). Slips and lapses are execution failures\u2014in other words, they occur from actionsthat do not result in the intended outcome. Slips are observable by others (e.g., anurse documenting that she gave a medication on the wrong patient's chart),whereas lapses usually involve memory failure and may be apparent only to theperson experiencing the failure (e.g., a nurse forgetting to administer a medicationbut not documenting it anywhere). Mistakes are errors that occur when an action144 PART II PROMOTION OF PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY CARE 3021_Ch07_141-173 16/01/17 3:24 PM Page 144Chapter 7 Improving and Managing Safe and Quality Care 145 Public discussion came about regarding the excessive work hours and lack of supervisionof residents in training. In 2003, the Accredi-tation Council for Graduate Medical Educa-tion (ACGME) established standards dictatinga maximum of 80 work hours/week and nomore than 30 hours/shift. This case was the one of the catalysts for the modern patient safety movement. It resulted in a new focus on medication errors and an impetus for computerized prescribing (Wachter, 2012). TJC established the Universal Protocol forPreventing Wrong Site, Wrong Procedure,and Wrong Person Surgery that became effective July 1, 2004. The three compo-nents of the Universal Protocol are a prepro-cedure verification, site marking, and a timeout (TJC, n.d.).Josie's mother, Sorrel King, has used herexperience to become an advocate for patient safety. She established the JosieKing Foundation to \"prevent others fromdying or being harmed by medical errors\"(Niedowski, 2003). Helen Haskell, Lewis's mother, has worked diligently to ensure that patients and families have access to physicians and rapid response teams (Acquaviva, Haskell, & Johnson, 2013).Thao has become a spokesperson for patient safety and second victims (Quaid,Thao, & Denham, 2010). The Quaids renewed attention to dangerous medical errors and started a patient safetyfoundation (Quaid, Thao, & Denham, 2010). Table 7-1 Medical Error Incidents and Policy Outcomes Libby Zion was an 18-year-old college student with a history of depression who went to the emergency department with complaints of fever, agitation, jerkingbody movements, and disorientation. She was admittedfor hydration and observation but died several hourslater from a possible drug-drug interaction. Of note, an intern and a resident assigned to Libby's care wereworking 36-hour shifts, which are believed to have contributed to the error that caused her death (Lerner,2006).Betsy Lehman was a 39-year-old award-winning healthcolumnist for the Boston Globe who died after a massive overdose of chemotherapy medications (Altman, 1995). Willie King was a 51-year-old man with diabetes who had the wrong foot amputated (Leisner, 1995). Josie King was an 18-month-old little girl admitted with second-degree burns over 60% of her body after fallinginto a bathtub full of hot water. After 2 weeks in the intensive care unit, Josie was transferred to a generalunit, and her family was making plans for her discharge.Josie died 1 week later of severe dehydration that hadgone unnoticed and as a result of an administration of methadone that should not have been given(Niedowski, 2003). Lewis Blackman was a 15-year-old boy admitted for aroutine surgical procedure for pectus excavatum . Four days later, Lewis bled to death from an undetectedperforated ulcer (Monk, 2002). Julie Thao was a registered nurse who unintentionally administered an epidural anesthetic intravenously, instead of an antibiotic. The patient died, and Thao was arrested on felony charges (\"Nurse charged,\" 2007). Dennis Quaid's twins were hospitalized in the neonatalintensive care unit and received heparin overdoses twice. The twins were administered 10,000 units/mL for a catheter flush instead of 10 units/mL (Ornstein,2008).Year Incident Outcome 1984 1994 1995 2001 2002 200620073021_Ch07_141-173 16/01/17 3:24 PM Page 145goes as planned but the action is incorrect. Mistakes are subtler and more complex than slips or lapses. As a result, mistakes are often difficult to detect and pose a greaterdanger to patients than slips or lapses (Reason, 1990). For example, a nurse is told byunlicensed assistive personnel (UAP) that a patient's temperature is elevated. Thenurse checks the patient's chart for an order and administers medication for the fever.Later, the nurse realizes that the UAP told her that the wrong patient had the elevatedtemperature, and so the nurse gave the medication to a patient who had an order butdid not have an elevated temperature. This constitutes a mistake because the actionwas taken with the incorrect patient, and therefore the action was incorrect. To truly ensure safety, any near miss , or a potential error that was discovered be- fore it was carried out, must be monitored. For example, a nurse enters a patient'sroom to administer a medication and realizes that it is the wrong patient. She im-mediately leaves the room with the medication and avoids the commission of anerror. In this situation, a near miss occurred and should be investigated to avoidan actual error in the future. A sentinel event is a patient safety event that results in any of the following: death, permanent harm, and severe temporary harm and intervention required to sustainlife (TJC, 2016c, para. 2). A sentinel event immediate investi-gation and response\" (TJC, 2016a, para. 4). Sentinel events are tracked by TJC. How-ever, reporting a sentinel event is voluntary. Human errors can be viewed from two perspectives: the person approach and the systems approach (Reason, 2000). The person approach focuses on unsafe actsof health-care professionals and errors as the result of human behaviors, such asinattention, forgetfulness, negligence, and incompetence. Organizations that focuson the person approach often attempt to correct human behavior through naming,blaming, shaming, and retraining. The systems approach, however, acknowledgesthat errors happen because humans are not perfect. With this approach, the focusis less on the individual making the error and more on system processes that led tothe error. In fact, errors are expected, and many defenses are in place to safeguardagainst them. Organizations that focus on the systems approach concentrate onchanging the work environment by establishing barriers and safeguards againstthe errors (Reason, 2000). Highly educated and competent nurses make errors;human factors can provide explanations for these errors. Unintentional human errors and system errors account for most preventable adverse events (Denham, 2007). Although most errors have multiple causes, the most commonare related to human factors, communication, and leadership (Shepard, 2011): Human factors include staffing levels, staff education and competency, and staffing shortages. When staffing is inadequate or nurses lack experience, patientsafety is jeopardized. Communication includes intraprofessional and interprofessional communication as well as interactions with patients and their families. Optimal patient outcomesrely on effective communication. Leadership includes leadership and management at all levels, organizational struc- ture, policies and procedures, and practice guidelines. When leadership factorsare inadequate, nurses may make decisions that can result in adverse events ornear misses. 146 PART II PROMOTION OF PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY CARE 3021_Ch07_141-173 16/01/17 3:24 PM Page 146Preventing errors and adverse events relies on a systems approach that reduces the likelihood of patient safety events. Nurse leaders and managers must be able to follow through with the following activities to ensure patient safety (Galt,Paschal, & Gleason, 2011, pp. 8-9): Develop a culture that is founded on the concept of safety for both patientsand staff. Standardize as many processes as possible while simultaneously allowing staffthe independent authority to solve problems in a creative manner as well asavoiding automatic action. Implement initiatives created by health-care organizations to improve safety andquality.Chapter 7 Improving and Managing Safe and Quality Care 147 Second Victim From Denham, 2007. Table 7-2 TRUST Treatment that is just Respect Understanding and compassionSupportive care Transparency and the opportunity to contributeNurses who make an error cannot be held 100% accountable when system failurespredispose them to human errors.All health-care professionals are susceptible to making an error and deserve to betreated with respect should an error occur. Health-care organizations must avoid thename-blame-shame cycle.Nurses who make an error need to be allowed to progress through the stages of grief. Nurses who make an error can experience the signs and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and need psychological support.Improving patient safety requires all health-care professionals to be more honest andtransparent about errors by identifying, disclosing, and reporting medical errors.The primary victim of any medical error is the patient, as well as his or her family. However, there is always a second victim: the nurse or health-care professional involved in an error that injures a patient (Smetzer, 2012).Fatal errors and those that cause major injury or disability can result in stress-related psychological and physio-logical reactions for the nurse involved. Often, second victims experience a medical emergency equivalent topost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Many second victims feel abandoned, isolated, and a loss of security, andthe traumatic event changes their self-perception (Denham, 2007; Smetzer, 2012). The second victim needscompassion, caring, and respect. Provision 1.5 of the ANA Code of Ethics states \"Respect for persons extends to all individuals with whom the nurse interacts. Nurses maintain professional, respectful, and caring relationshipswith colleagues and are committed to fair treatment, transparency, integrity-preserving compromise, and thebest resolution of conflict\" (ANA, 2015a, p. 4). Five rights for second victims have been identified using the acronym TRUST: 1) Treatment that is just, 2) Respect, 3) Understanding and compassion, 4) Supportive care, and 5) Transparency and the opportunity to contribute (Table 7-2; Denham, 2007). Health-care leaders must address the rights of all health-care professionals involved in unintentional harm to patients through systems failures and human errors. Nurse leaders and managers must promote respect for nurse's rights and responsibilities, maintain empathetic andcaring relationships, and establish a supportive and healthy work environment (ANA, 2015b). 3021_Ch07_141-173 16/01/17 3:24 PM Page 147148 PART II PROMOTION OF PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY CARE Analyze complex processes by using appropriate tools. Collect data on errors and incidents within the unit to identify opportunities for improvement and track progress. CREATING A CULTURE OF SAFETY A culture of safety is a blame-free environment in which staff members feel comfort- able reporting errors and near misses. Until the early 2000s, when an error wasmade by a nurse, the approach by management was punitive and involved identi-fying the individual who made the error and requiring that he or she to be namedin an incident report and complete a medication review course. This approach didnot seek the root cause of the error and was not effective in reducing errors. Sadly,this approach still occurs today. A culture of safety supports nurses in that it is non-punitive and emphasizes accountability, excellence, honesty, integrity, and mutualrespect (Johnson, 2012). In a culture of safety, patient and employee safety is the priority, and organiza- tional leadership is committed to providing safe and quality care as well as creatinga safe work environment. A culture of safety develops over time and includes threestages (Page, 2004, pp. 296-298): Stage 1. Safety management is based on rules and regulations: The organiza- tion sees safety as an external requirement imposed by regulatory bodies, andmere compliance with rules and regulations is considered adequate. Stage 2. Good safety performance becomes an organizational goal: Safety is perceived by leadership and management as important, but safety perform-ance is addressed in terms of goals rather than as part of the strategic planand culture of the organization. Stage 3. Safety performance is seen as dynamic and continuously improving: Safety performance is viewed by everyone in the organization as dynamicand in need of continuous improvement in this stage. There is a strong emphasis on communication, training, management style, and improving efficiency and effectiveness. A culture of safety promotes staff engagement and empowerment and focuses on why an error was made rather than who made the error. Embedded within a cul- ture of safety is a just culture, or a culture that is fair to those who make an error. A just culture improves patient safety because it encourages nurses to learn fromeach other's mistakes and to report all errors and near misses without fear of reper-cussion. Nurses are responsible for their own actions and are expected to provideconstructive feedback to their peers (Shepard, 2011; Wachter, 2012). Nurse leaders and managers are responsible for promoting a culture of safety and creating an environment where nursing care is delivered safely and effectively(ANA, 2015b). Creating a culture of safety is hard work; however, once a culture ofsafety is established, \"it is easy to identify its presence, as well as its absence\"(Wachter, 2012, p. 275). Part of creating a culture of safety is encouraging staff members to voice their concerns when they feel that a situation is a safety risk. This can be done througha communication technique called \"CUS,\" a three-step process that assists staff 3021_Ch07_141-173 16/01/17 3:24 PM Page 148members in stopping an activity when they sense or discover a safety breach. CUS stands for the following (TJC, 2012, p. 52): 1.I am Concerned. 2.I am Uncomfortable. 3.This is a Safety issue. Further, nurse leaders and managers can \"promote a process of mistake or error mitigation that recognizes that errors may be the result of system breakdowns or failures to build a good system, as opposed to putting the total blame on individ-uals\" (ANA, 2015b, p. 6). A culture of safety relies on a systems approach that reduces the likelihood of pa- tient safety events. A key aspect of preventing errors and adverse events is to avoidautomatic actions. As nurses become experienced with a specific task, cognitive adap-tive mechanisms kick in and allow for nurses to go on \"autopilot\" (Galt, Fuji, Gleason,& McQuillan, 2011). Unfortunately, this ability to take complex skills and make themroutine can negatively impact patient safety. As tasks and skills become automatic,nurses pay less attention to details, and this deficit can result in variations in care andthe possibility of a patient safety event or error. Evidence shows that varying patternsof care lead to poor clinical outcomes. In contrast, standardizing care can improveclinical outcomes, reduce inefficiencies, and decrease costs (Tsakos et al., 2014). Nurseleaders and managers can intervene by ensuring that nurses use standardized pro-cedures and checklists rather than relying on memory and automatic approaches topatient care. When there are variations in processes and procedures, confusion, delaysin care, and varying levels of nursing care quality can result. Standardizing processesand procedures can help reduce errors and improve quality care. Standardization is the process of developing, agreeing on, and implementing uniform criteria, methods,processes, designs, or practices that can improve patient safety and quality of care(Tsakos et al., 2014). Standardized processes benefit health care by: Providing nurse leaders and managers and nursing staff with a method for com-paring outcomes resulting from standardized processes across the organization Enabling nurse leaders and managers to compare data and interpret relevanceand efficacy of a specific intervention or process Allowing for a way for nurses at all levels (as well as other health-care profes-sionals) to communicate with one another in meaningful ways (i.e., use of stan-dardized terms)Chapter 7 Improving and Managing Safe and Quality Care 149 LEARNING ACTIVITY 7-1 Culture of Blame Versus Culture of Safety Compare and contrast a culture of blame with a culture of safety related to the following: Medication errors Near misses Sentinel events3021_Ch07_141-173 16/01/17 3:24 PM Page 149Increasing the likelihood of user familiarity with technology and equipment that can reduce risk of human errors Allowing nurses at all levels as well as other health-care professionals to learnfrom each other's experiences Standardization can take many forms including using checklists, approved ab- breviations and practice guidelines, electronic health records, and computerizedphysician order entry; storing equipment and supplies in the same location onunits; and designing units using the same floorplan within a facility. Although achallenge, nurse leaders and managers must standardize as many processes as pos-sible while simultaneously allowing staff the independent authority to solve prob-lems in a creative manner. PATIENT SAFETY INITIATIVES Patient safety advocacy groups have emerged since the 1980s in response to con-cerns about the less than stellar quality of the American health-care system and theprevalence of patient safety concerns. The leaders of many of these groups are peo-ple who have had personal experiences with medical errors, thus putting a humanface on patient safety issues (Wachter, 2012). The modern patient safety movementdoes not call for perfection from our health-care professionals; rather, it acknowl-edges that humans make errors and replaces the blame-and-shame game with sys-tems thinking (Wachter, 2012). The following are organizations that have put in place safety initiatives that can be used by nurse leaders and managers to promote safe and quality care. All of thesepatient safety initiatives can positively impact the overall quality of health care. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Established in 1989 as the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research within theDepartment of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Researchand Quality (or AHRQ, which it became in 1999) has always had the mission \"tomake health care safer, higher quality, more accessible, equitable, and affordable\"(AHRQ, 2016, para. 1). In response to the IOM sentinel report To Err Is Human , the AHRQ set out to build a foundation to better understand patient safety. In 2005,the AHRQ established the Patient Safety Network (PSNet), a website featuring essential resources relevant to the patient safety community. Materials are selectedfor inclusion on the site according to the following criteria (AHRQ, n.d., para. 4): Support multidisciplinary, \"systems\" approach to minimizing errors inhealth care Come from a wide range of disciplines and sources Have been written and/or sponsored by credible sources Are of interest to the patient safety community at large, both expert and novice Are of value for gaining insight into and supporting patient safety Nurses at all levels can use PSNet to find tips for preventing medical errors and promoting patient safety. Nurse leaders and managers can use PSNet for150 PART II PROMOTION OF PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY CARE 3021_Ch07_141-173 16/01/17 3:24 PM Page 150suggestions about measuring health-care quality as well as accessing consumer assessment of health plans, evaluation software, report tools, and case studies. American Nurses Association In 1994, the ANA launched an initiative to investigate the impact of health-care restructuring on the safety and quality of patient care and the nursing profession(Montalvo, 2007). The Patient Safety and Quality Initiative focused on educatingregistered nurses about quality measurement, informing the public about safe andquality health care, and investigating methods to evaluate the safety and qualityof patient care empirically. Through this initiative, strong links between nursingactions and patient outcomes were identified (Montalvo, 2007). In 1998, the ANA established the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators (NDNQI), which collects data from participating facilities on 19 nursing-sensitive qual-ity indicators. The NDQI is used by 2,000 hospitals nationwide and reports nationalcomparison information related to nursing-sensitive quality indicators and unit per-formance. Until recently, the NDNQI was managed by the University of Kansas Schoolof Nursing. In 2014, Press Ganey acquired NDQI to offer more specific insights intonursing performance to improve patient experiences and outcomes (Press Ganey,2014). Nurse leaders and managers should use these nursing-sensitive quality indi-cators as part of a comprehensive approach to mea suring and evaluating quality ofcare and assist in improving patient safety. These indicators reflect the characteristicsof the nursing workforce, nursing processes, and patient outcomes, which vary according to the characteristics or processes of nursing (Montalvo & Dunton, 2007, p. 1). In addition, the NDQI also measures characteristics of the nursing workforcethat impact the quality of patient care and the patient's experience such as staffinglevels, nurse turnover, and nurse education and certification (Press Ganey, 2014). Nursing-sensitive quality indicators are indicators that reflect elements of patient care that are directly impacted by the quality and quantity of nursing care and includethe following: Structure indicators relate to the care environment and include staffing levels, hours of nursing care per patient day, nursing skill levels, and education of staff. Process indicators relate to how nursing care is provided and include elements falling under the nursing process (i.e., assessment, diagnosis, planning, interven-tion, and evaluation of nursing care) and job satisfaction. Outcome indicators relate to the results of nursing care and include changes in a pa- tient's health status related to nursing care, such as pressure ulcers and patientfalls. Outcome indicators improve when there is greater quality and quantity ofnursing care. Box 7-1 provides a list of nursing-sensitive quality indicators currently being collected. National Quality Forum The National Quality Forum (NQF) is a nonprofit organization established in 1999in response to the recommendations from the Advisory Commission on ConsumerChapter 7 Improving and Managing Safe and Quality Care 151 3021_Ch07_141-173 16/01/17 3:24 PM Page 151Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry (NQF, 2016a). The NQF is com- mitted to helping the United States achieve better and affordable care and, ulti-mately, improving the overall health of Americans (NQF, 2016c). The NQF isinvolved in the following activities to meet this goal (NQF, 2016c): Setting standards for health-care measurements Recommending measures for use in payment and public reporting programs Identifying and accelerating QI priorities Advancing electronic measurement to capture necessary data needed to measureperformance Providing information and tools to help health-care decision makers One national priority the NQF is focusing on is patient safety. The NQF identifies the following three goals as critical in making health care safer for Americans (NQF,2016b, para. 2): 1.Reduce preventable hospital admissions incidence of adverse health-care-associated conditions. 3.Reduce harm from inappropriate or unnecessary care. The NQF has endorsed a set of nursing-sensitive quality indicators that have been pivotal to understanding nursing's influence on patient outcomes as well as promoting a measure for QI. The nursing-sensitive quality indicators endorsed bythe NQF are indicated by an asterisk in Box 7-1. Nurse leaders and managersshould consider monitoring and measuring these quality indicators as they striveto create an environment of safe and quality care. Institute for Healthcare Improvement The Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) was founded in the late 1980s andis currently a leading innovator in health and health-care improvement in the152 PART II PROMOTION OF PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY CARE BOX 7-1BOX 7-1 Current Nursing-Sensitive Quality IndicatorsCurrent Nursing-Sensitive Quality Indicators *Nursing-sensitive indicators endorsed by the National Quality Forum.

The IHI collaborates with the health-care improvement community to remove improvement roadblocks and launch innova-tions that dramatically improve patient care (IHI, 2016b). The IHI has been responsible for two nationwide initiatives, the 100,000 Lives Campaign and the 5 Million Lives Campaign, which spread best practice changesto thousands of hospitals in the United States. The 100,000 Lives Campaign ranfrom January 2005 through June 2006, with the goal to reduce morbidity and mor-tality significantly in the American health-care system. The IHI called on hospitalsand health-care providers to implement the following interventions to reduce harmand death from medical error (IHI, 2016e, para 3): Deploy rapid response teams to patients at risk of cardiac or respiratory arrest. Deliver reliable, evidence-based care to patients with myocardial infarctions toprevent deaths from heart attacks. Prevent adverse drug events through medication reconciliation, a process of com-paring the patient's list of medications with those ordered by health-careproviders on admission, transfer, and/or discharge. Prevent central line infections by implementing a series of evidence-based stepscalled the \"Central Line Bundle.\" Prevent surgical site infections by administering the appropriate preoperativeantibiotics and at the proper time. Prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia by implementing a series of evidence-based steps called the \"Ventilator Bundle.\" The IHI estimated that more than 2,000 hospitals made a commitment to imple- ment the interventions to reduce harm, and 122,300 lives were saved during the18-month campaign (IHI, 2016e; Saver, 2006). The 5 Million Lives Campaign ran from December 2006 through December 2009. The goal was to reduce illness or medical harm, such as adverse events and surgicalcomplications, and patient mortality significantly. The IHI encouraged hospitalsand health-care providers to continue the efforts begun in the 100,000 Lives Campaign, which nurse leaders and managers should do, as well as employ thefollowing additional strategies to reduce harm and death from medical errors (IHI,2016e, para 2): Prevent pressure ulcers by using evidence-based guidelines. Reduce methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) through basic changesin infection control processes throughout hospitals. Prevent harm from high-alert medications with a focus on anticoagulants, seda-tives, narcotics, and insulin. Reduce surgical complications by reliably implementing changes in care identi-fied by the Surgical Care Improvement Project. Deliver evidence-based care to patients with congestive heart failure to reducereadmissions. Get hospital boards on board by defining and spreading new processes to encourage boards of directors to be more effective in the improvement of care. At the close of the campaign, 4,050 hospitals were enrolled, reflecting an un- precedented commitment to patient safety and quality. The IHI believes that theChapter 7 Improving and Managing Safe and Quality Care 153 3021_Ch07_141-173 16/01/17 3:24 PM Page 153campaign resulted in a massive reduction of patient injuries and tremendous improvement in patient outcomes, \"with more than 2,000 facilities pursuing eachof the Campaign's 12 interventions to reduce infection, surgical complication, med-ication errors, and other forms of unreliable care in facilities. Eight states enrolled100% of their hospitals in the Campaign, and 18 states enrolled over 90% of theirhospitals in the Campaign\" (IHI, 2016e, para 10). The IHI emphasizes that a national study is needed to determine whether 5 million instances of harm wereprevented as a result of the campaign (IHI, 2016e). The Joint Commission TJC, a nonprofit organization founded in 1951, accredits and certifies approximately20,000 health-care organizations in the United States based on established standards(TJC, 2016b). TJC is involved in numerous activities to ensure that patients \"expe-rience the safest, highest quality, best-valued health care across all settings\" (TJCs,2016b). Its mission is to \"continuously improve health care for the public, in col-laboration with other stakeholders, by evaluating health-care organizations and inspiring them to excel in providing safe and effective care of the highest qualityand value\" (TJC, 2016b, para 2). In support of its mission, TJC reviews agency activities in response to sentinel events. TJC is committed to patient safety through initiatives including its Speak Up programs. TJC worked with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid to launch theSpeak Up programs in 2002 with the goal of urging patients to take an active rolein preventing medical errors by becoming informed participants in their care. SpeakUp encourages health-care consumers to do the following (TJC, 2016c): Speak up if you have questions or concerns. If you still do not understand, ask again. It is your body, and you have a right to know. Pay attention to the care you get. Always make sure you are getting the right treatments and medicines by the right health-care professionals. Do not assumeanything. Educate yourself about your illness: Learn about the medical tests you have and your treatment plan. Ask a trusted family member or friend to be your advocate (advisor or supporter). Know what medicines you take and why you take them. Medicine errors are the most common health-care mistake. Use a hospital, clinic, surgery center, or other type of health-care organization that has been carefully checked out. Participate in all decisions about your treatment: You are the center of the health- care team. The Speak Up programs include free brochures, posters, and videos available at www.jointcommission.org/speakup.aspx. The Speak Up programs are very suc-cessful at promoting increased communication with both patients and staff aboutsafety. Nurse leaders and managers should promote the Speak Up programs by including information about them in unit meetings and staff orientation. As advo-cates, nurse leaders and managers should assist patients and their families withobtaining information about Speak Up programs. 154 PART II PROMOTION OF PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY CARE 3021_Ch07_141-173 16/01/17 3:24 PM Page 154TJC also established the National Patient Safety Goals (NPSGs) program in 2002 to assist health-care organizations address patient safety concerns. A panel of patient safety experts works with TJC to identify emerging patient safety issuesand strategies to best address these issues. The first set of NPSGs became effectivein January 2003 and are still updated annually (TJC, 2016d). Nurse leaders andmanagers can keep up with the NPSGs, which address specific clinical areas suchas ambulatory health care, behavioral health care, critical access hospitals, homecare, hospitals, laboratory services, long-term care, and office-based surgery, athttps://www.jointcommission.org/topics/patient_safety.aspx. World Health Organization WHO member states agreed on a resolution on patient safety in 2002 and recog-nized patient safety as a global health-care issue in 2004. Believing that every patient should receive \"safe health care, every time, everywhere,\" the WHOlaunched the Patient Safety Programme in 2004. The WHO defines patient safetyas \"the absence of preventable harm to a patient during the process of health care\"(WHO, 2016, para 3). In 2006, the WHO launched the High 5s Project to address major concerns about patient safety globally. The project derived its name from the WHO's goals to reduce the frequency of five patient safety problems in five countries over 5 years(WHO, 2014b, p. 9). The goals of the High 5s Project were to use standardizationacross multicountry settings and to use a multipronged approach to evaluating thestandard operating protocols (WHO, 2014b). Five standard operating protocols and associated evaluation instruments were de- veloped between 2007 and 2014 to address the following issues (WHO, 2014b, p. 17): 1.Medication accuracy at transitions in care 2.Correct procedure at the correct body site 3.Use of concentrated injectable medicines 4.Communication during patient care handovers 5.Health-care-associated infections The first two standard operating protocols have been implemented by all coun- tries participating in the High 5s Project, including the United States. Nurses at all levels should be aware of these patient safety initiatives and their impact on bestpractices and safe, quality nursing care. Nurse leaders and managers must embracepatient safety initiatives as they establish a work environment that fosters safe,quality care delivery. PRINCIPLES OF QUALITY IMPROVEMENT Florence Nightingale was concerned about quality 150 years ago. She has beencalled \"the woman who discovered quality\" (Meyer & Bishop, 2007, p. 240), andshe could also be considered an evangelist for performance improvement. Whenworking in the British Military hospital system, she worked tirelessly to change theconditions for patients. She collected data, developed tables to display the data,and reported statistics to British leaders. Initially, Nightingale's work was relatedChapter 7 Improving and Managing Safe and Quality Care 155 3021_Ch07_141-173 16/01/17 3:24 PM Page 155to mortality rates in hospitals. However, she soon informed those she reported to that \"hospital mortality statistics have hitherto given little information on the effi-ciency of the hospital, i.e., the extent to which it fulfils the purpose it was estab-lished for, because there are elements of existence of which such statistics havehitherto taken no cognizance\" (Nightingale, 1859, p. 5). She goes on to discuss theneed for better sanitary conditions in hospitals and that surgical operations andtheir results should be monitored. In essence, what Nightingale was referring to iswhat we know today as quality improvement. Quality improvement (QI) as it is used in health care today was first used in industry in the early 1900s. In the 1920s at the Bell Telephone company, a young engineer bythe name of Walter Shewhart explored using statistical methods to identify issues andestablish strategies to improve them. His main premise was that statistical controlwould allow identification of causes of variations in a process. Further, by maintainingcontrol over processes, future outputs could be predicted and allow processes to bemanaged economically (Smith, 2009). His quality methods were used in American industry in the 1930s. He developed various tools such as charts and graphs and prin-ciples of statistical control that resulted in the basic principles of quality control stillused today. Shewhart is known as the modern father of quality control (Tague, 2005). A student of Shewhart's, W. Edwards Deming, worked for the United States Census Bureau in the 1940s and also taught quality control methods to engineersand statisticians. He became disillusioned with many engineers and statisticiansbecause they did not understand or value the benefits of the methods he taught.After World War II, he went to Japan, where he lectured on quality control and sta-tistical and managerial concepts for quality to Japanese engineers and scientists(Tague, 2005). He believed if the Japanese manufacturers applied the principles,they could improve the quality of their products, and those products would be de-sired worldwide (Tague, 2005). He is known for 14 key principles for managementthat are used by managers and leaders to improve business and organizational effectiveness. Deming was a visionary whose belief in continuous improvementled to many theories and teachings that influence quality, management, and lead-ership today (W. Edwards Deming Institute, 2016). Joseph Juran was another engineer interested in statistical control and quality. Like Shewhart, he also worked for Bell and was involved in conducting statisticalquality control. He is often called the \"father of quality.\" Juran developed the Paretoprinciple, which is one of the most useful tools used in management today (JuranGlobal, 2016). He described quality from the customer's perspective and suggestedthat higher quality means that more features will meet customer needs, and higherquality will also include fewer defects. Juran visited Japan and worked with Dem-ing to further teach and help industrial managers understand their responsibilitiesfor quality production. In the 1970s and 1980s, the American auto industry and electronics industries experienced the influx of high-quality products from Japanese competition in theautomotive and electronics industries. The U.S. companies requested assistance fromDeming and Juran to begin quality management and quality control programs ortotal quality management (TQM) (Tague, 2005). TQM is \"any quality managementprogram that addresses all areas of an organization, emphasizes customer satisfac-tion, and uses continuous improvement methods and tools\" (Tague, 2005, p. 14). 156 PART II PROMOTION OF PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY CARE 3021_Ch07_141-173 16/01/17 3:24 PM Page 156Health-care organizations are called to use TQM by implementing QI pro- grams aimed at monitoring, assessing, and improving the quality of health care delivered and to continuously seek higher levels of performance to optimize care.QI entails a systematic and continuous series of actions that leads to measurableimprovement in health care and the health status of specific patient groups (U.S.Department of Health and Human Services [HHS] Health Resources and ServicesAdministration [HRSA], 2011). All QI programs incorporate four key principles(HHS and HRSA, 2011): 1.QI works as systems and processes. 2.There is a focus on patients. 3.There is a focus on being part of the team. 4.There is a focus on the use of data.Successful QI also requires the following elements: \"fostering and sustaining a culture of change and safety, developing and clarifying an understanding of the problem, involving key stakeholders, testing change strategies, and continuousmonitoring of performance and reporting of findings to sustain the change\"(Hughes, 2008, p. 18). In addition, effective QI programs require committed man-agement, an established QI model and processes, and a set of QI tools. There are many frameworks for QI, and most have steps that assist in asking questions, gathering appropriate data, and taking effective and efficient action toaddress the issue (Tague, 2005). The QI process is similar to the nursing process inthat, once a plan is in place to address an issue or problem, it is re-evaluated. TheQI process is cyclical and involves setting standards of care, taking measures ac-cording to standards of care, evaluating care, recommending improvements, ensur-ing that improvements are implemented, and evaluating the improvements. Nurseleaders and managers are integral in the QI process because they are responsible forensuring the safety and quality of nursing care. Nurse leaders and managers canimprove patient safety by applying the QI principles by using a patient-centeredapproach (Galt, Paschal, & Gleason, 2011). The QI process begins with monitoring specific measures that are part of a care process to identify variations in care and compare findings with performance levelsor benchmarks established. If a measure is outside the expected performance level,a problem is identified, and an investigation ensues to determine the root cause ofthe problem. The following steps (illustrated in Fig. 7-1) can be used to monitorand improve performance (Donabedian, 2003): 1.Determining what to monitor: Some activities are directed by government agencies that provide care, pay for care, and assume responsibility for its quality to be monitored. All activities that fall below an expected level of performance mustbe monitored. 2.Determining priorities in monitoring: All activities that could jeopardize patient safety should be monitored. Four characteristics guide determining the priority of a prob-lem: the problem is believed to occur frequently; error or failure in performance is known or believed to occur frequently; when it occurs, such error or failure inperformance is believed or known to have serious consequences to health and iscostly; and the error or failure in question can be rather easily corrected (p. 40).Chapter 7 Improving and Managing Safe and Quality Care 157 3021_Ch07_141-173 16/01/17 3:24 PM Page 1573.Selecting approaches for assessing performance: This step requires the nurse leader or manager to determine the type of information needed (structure, process, or outcome) to make an inference about quality. It is important to avoid focusingonly on outcome measurements and to recognize that there can be weaknessesin the structure and process that lead to failures or poor performance. A combi-nation of approaches is needed for a more comprehensive assessment of quality.By using a combination of approaches, the cause of poor performance or out-come can be attributed to structure and/or process, and this attribution helpsdirect the improvement process. 4.Formulating criteria and standards: A criterion is \"an attribute of structure, process, or outcome that is used to draw an inference about quality\" (p. 60), whereas astandard is \"a specified quantitative measure of magnitude or frequency thatspecifies what is good or less so\" (p. 60). 5.Obtaining the necessary information: Data can be collected from medical records, surveys, financial records, statistical reports, databases, and direct observations.158 PART II PROMOTION OF PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY CARE Identify what to monitor and set priorities Select an approach for assessing performance Formulate criterion and standards and establish performance levels or benchmarks Data collection and analysis-compare results with established benchmarks Evaluate quality Plan and implement small test of change Re-evaluate Figure 7-1 Quality improvement process.3021_Ch07_141-173 16/01/17 3:24 PM Page 1586.Choosing how monitor: Monitoring be prospective (or anticipatory), oc- curring before the event; concurrent, conducted during the course of patient care; and retrospective, occurring after the event. The most frequent type isretrospective. 7.Constructing monitoring systems: Monitoring of activities for improvement should be an organizational endeavor with a specific department or unit responsible toplan, coordinate, direct, and implement the process as a whole. In addition, thereshould be coordinated efforts at the unit level including all personnel involvedin the activity under investigation. 8.Bringing about behavior change: Change is implemented with the goal of changing the structure and/or process and, ultimately, improving the outcome or level ofperformance. Once a QI activity is identified, nurse leaders and managers form an interpro- fessional team to implement the QI process. Nurses at all levels may be part of an intraprofessional or interprofessional team to explore the problem identified. Theteam should be made up of members representing those involved with the prob-lem. Nurse leaders and managers may lead the team or designate a nurse or otherhealth-care professional to facilitate the QI team. For the QI process to be effectiveand successful, nurse leaders and managers must promote teamwork and collabo-ration in the workplace environment. As members of the interprofessional team, nurses should be able to understand and use QI principles and processes as well as outcome measures. Nurses at alllevels must be concerned about what they are responsible for, what is the most inneed of improvement, and what they can improve (Donabedian, 2003). Moreover,nurses at all levels have an obligation to collaborate with others to provide qualityhealth-care services safely (ANA, 2015a). Nurse leaders and managers must fosterstaff involvement in safety initiatives and QI processes to begin changing theprocesses, attitudes, and behaviors of staff (Newhouse & Poe, 2005). They musthelp staff members understand that patient safety and QI are not interchangeablebut should be implemented simultaneously and continuously to make the mostimpact (McFadden, Stock, and Gowen, 2014). MODELS FOR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT Donabedian Model One of the most popular frameworks for assessing quality in health care is the Donabedian Model . This model provides a framework for examining and evaluating the quality of health care by looking at three categories of information that can becollected to draw inferences about the quality of health care: 1) structure, the con-ditions under which care is provided; 2) process, the activities that encompasshealth care; and 3) outcomes, the desirable or undesirable changes in individualsas a result of health care (Donabedian, 2003) (Table 7-3). The model has been usedin health care as well as other industries. Figure 7-2 illustrates the DonabedianModel as it relates to nursing practice. The Donabedian Model provides a starting point for any QI activity, and other QI models can be used to further define and assess safety and quality problems inChapter 7 Improving and Managing Safe and Quality Care 159 3021_Ch07_141-173 16/01/17 3:24 PM Page 159health care. Typically, a health-care agency selects a model or a combination of models that will best fit their organization's mission, vision, and philosophy aswell as the goals and objectives of the improvement activity. Everyone in an or-ganization is part of continuous QI, and nurse leaders and managers often overseeQI initiatives. Lean Model The Lean Model assumes that all processes contain waste and involves the thought process of doing more with less. The model, originated at Toyota and also knownas the Toyota Production System (TPS), is built on four basic principles: 1) allwork processes are highly specified; 2) all customer and supplier relationshipsare clear; 3) pathways between people and process steps are specific and consis-tent; and 4) improvements are made based on scientific methods and at the lowestlevel of the organization (Spear & Bowen, 1999). Factors involved in the successfulapplication of TPS in health care include eliminating non-value-added activitiesassociated with complex processes, work arounds, and rework; involving frontline160 PART II PROMOTION OF PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY CARE Staffing levels will be maintained at a ratio of one nurse for two patients (1:2) on all shifts 7 days/week.Between 5% and 20% of all patients undergoing abdominalsurgery over a 12-month period will receive blood transfusions.Less than 1% of all patients undergoing abdominal surgeryover a 12-month period will die of surgical complications.

A major advantage of the TPS is that frontline workers are empow-ered to identify problems and make improvements at the point of care. In thismodel, nurse leaders and managers provide direction and function as coaches. Six Sigma Model Originally designed as a business strategy, the Six Sigma Model is a rigorous method that encompasses five steps: 1) define, 2) measure, 3) analyze, 4) improve, and 5) control (DMAIC; Table 7-4). Sigma is a letter from the Greek alphabet (/H9268 ) used in statistics and measures variation or spread. Six Sigma refers to six standarddeviations from the mean (Tague, 2005). It is used in QI to define the number ofacceptable errors produced by a process. Six Sigma involves improving, design-ing, and monitoring processes to minimize or reduce waste (Hughes, 2008). Institute for Healthcare Improvement Model of Improvement The IHI Model of Improvement has two parts. First, three fundamental questions areasked, in any order: 1) What are we trying to accomplish? 2) How will we know thata change is an improvement? 3) What changes can we make that will result in im-provement? Second, the plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycle is implemented: Plan involves developing a plan to initiate a small change, dois implementing the plan and collecting data about the process, study includes studying and summarizing the results of the change, and act encompasses three possible actions\u2014adopt the change, adapt the change, or abandon the change. Once the cycle is complete, the process starts overagain (IHI, 2014). Using the PDSA promotes continuous QI. The PDSA cycle is usedto identify issues and improve care (Fig. 7-3). PDSA includes implementing small testsof change to improve care; therefore, it can be integrated with any of the QI models toimplement and evaluate small tests of change. Nurse leaders and managers may usePDSA when implementing any change in procedures and when planning data col-lection and analysis to verify root causes of a problem or error. Failure Modes and Effects Analysis Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) is useful in determining what aspectof a process needs to change. The goals of FMEA are to prevent patient safetyevents by identifying all possible ways a process could result in failure, estimateChapter 7 Improving and Managing Safe and Quality Care 161 Table 7-4 Six Sigma DMAIC Principles From Tague, 2005.Define Define the process and outcome to be improved. Measure Track performance through data collection. Analyze Analyze data to verify poor performance. Improve Use data analysis to inform a plan for improvement. Control Use ongoing monitoring and improvement as needed.3021_Ch07_141-173 16/01/17 3:24 PM Page 161the probability of failure, estimate the consequences of failure, and establish an action plan to prevent potential failures from occurring. The steps in the FMEA process include failure modes, or what could go wrong; failure causes, or why would the failure happen; and failure effects, or what wouldbe the consequences of each failure (Nolan, Resar, Haraden, & Griffin, 2004, p. 9).FMEA is a systematic approach to evaluate a process. Potential failures are priori-tized according to their consequences, with most serious first. Nurse leaders andmanagers may use FMEA before developing plans to modify a process or analyzingfailures in a current process (Tague, 2005). Root Cause Analysis Root cause analysis (RCA) is a \"formalized investigation and problem-solving approach focused on identifying and understanding the underlying causes of anevent as well as potential events that were intercepted . . . used with the under-standing that system, rather than individual factors, are likely the root cause ofmost problems\" (Hughes, 2008, pp. 6-7). Should a sentinel event occur, an RCA isrequired and must be followed by a realistic action plan to address and eliminaterisks (TJC, 2012). An RCA is completed after a patient safety event and includes the sequence of events that led up to the event, possible causal factors and root cause, and an actionplan that identifies specific strategies to reduce the risk of a similar incident occur-ring in the future. A typical action plan should address the following: responsibilityfor implementing and overseeing the plan, pilot testing or a small test of change,162 PART II PROMOTION OF PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY CARE STUDY Data analyis Compare lessons learnedPLAN Plan a change for improvement ACT Adopt Adapt AbandonDO Carry out the plan Document Collect data Figure 7-3 Plan-do-study-act.3021_Ch07_141-173 16/01/17 3:24 PM Page 162Chapter 7 Improving and Managing Safe and Quality Care 163 EXPLORING THE EVIDENCE 7-1 time lines, and an appropriate approach for measuring the effectiveness of the plan. Nurse leaders and managers use RCA to investigate any medical error that occurson their unit. Often, nurse leaders and managers use RCA to find the root cause ofan error and use PDSA to implement a change aimed at improving or alleviatingthe cause.Walker, L. J., O'Connell, M. E., and Giesler. A.L . (2015). Keeping a grasp on patient safety. American Nurse Today, 10(1), 49-50. Aim The aim of this quality improvement project was to remove barriers to gait belt useby providing a visual cue to remind staff to use a gait belt when ambulating patients. Methods The PDSA framework was used to determine whether hanging gait belts on hooksin patients' rooms would increase their use: Plan A target unit was selected to implement the \"test of change.\" Staff was educated about the upcoming change. Project goals were established. Hooks were installed in patients' rooms. Do Audit tools were developed, and preaudit data were collected for 2 weeks toprovide a baseline. Six audits were completed over a 4-month period. Study The QI team used a risk-for-injury screening tool and reviewed patient fallrisk scores, risk for injury scores, mental health status, mobility status, and useof assistive devices The team also looked at missed opportunities where patients could have benefited from a gait belt but one was not used. Act The QI team reported ongoing results and collaborated with staff to foster engagement. Data analysis showed that nurses were identifying patients at risk for falls accurately, and there was an overall increase of 38% in placing gait belts in patients' rooms. Implications for Nurse Leaders and Managers This QI project offers an example of a nurse-driven quality improvement activitythat encouraged patient ambulation and promoted patient safety. Nurse leadersand managers can involve staff in QI initiatives to assist them in identifying areasfor improvement, foster engagement and accountability, and provide consistentsupport for staff during the process.3021_Ch07_141-173 16/01/17 3:24 PM Page 163164 PART II PROMOTION OF PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY CARE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT TOOLS There are many tools available to use in the QI process for different purposes, whether it is to communicate information, determine whether a problem exists,or help in decision making (Boxer & Goldfarb, 2011). QI tools also help to guidedata collection, identify trends and possible problems, and provide a way to dis-play data collected. All nurses participating in the QI process should be able touse basic QI tools, such as run charts, histograms, fishbone diagrams, flow charts,and Pareto charts, to collect, analyze, and display data. Selection of an appropriatetool to analyze and display data is based on the goal of the QI project. When de-termining how to display data, it is important to consider the type of data andthe time period during which the data is collected. For example, monthly dataare best collected over a 13-month period. This provides trends over an entireyear and compares the current month with the same month the previous year(Boxer & Goldfarb, 2011). Run Chart A run chart communicates data, shows trends over time, and reflects how a process is operating (Boxer & Goldfarb, 2011). In a run chart, the vertical axis (y) represents theprocess variable and the horizontal axis (x) represents time. The mean or median ofdata is displayed as a horizontal line and allows nurses and the QI team to see changesin measurements without having to compute statistics. Data points above the medianindicate an improvement in a process, whereas data points below the median reflecta deterioration in the process. Run charts are among the most important tools for de-termining whether a change was effective (IHI, 2016f). QI teams would use run chartsto display trends over time and changes in quality over time. For example, nurse lead-ers and managers would use a run chart to determine whether there was a change inthe number of central line infections after a new dressing change protocol was imple-mented. Figure 7-4 displays an example of a run chart for the number of falls on a unitover a 5-month period. Looking at the chart, falls on the unit were above the medianline in February and April, thus indicating a problem with the fall precaution protocols Figure 7-4 Run chart.014 January FebruaryMedian March April# of FallsRun 8642 May 3021_Ch07_141-173 16/01/17 3:24 PM Page 164during that time. Nurse leaders and managers would use this data to investigate pos- sible causes for the increase in falls during those months. Bar Chart A bar chart is the most common method used to display categorical data, and the scale must start at zero. When using a bar chart, categories are listed along the horizontalaxis, and frequencies or percentages are listed on the vertical axis (Tague, 2005). Nurseleaders and managers would use a bar chart to illustrate categorical data. For exam-ple, in looking at the increase in the number of falls on the unit, the nurse leader andmanager may investigate the staff mix (i.e., number of registered nurses, licensedpractical nurses, technicians) on the unit during those time periods. Figure 7-5 dis-plays an example of a bar chart for the educational level and gender of registerednurses employed in a hospital. Histogram A histogram is a type of bar chart used to display frequency distributions and is useful when the time sequence of events is not available. For QI, histograms assist the team in recognizing and analyzing patterns in numerical data that may not be apparent by looking at data in a table or finding the mean or median of data (IHI, 2016d). Nurse leaders and managers could use a histogram to illustrate the average length of stay of surgical patients on the unit. Figure 7-6 displays an exampleof a histogram for student grades on a dosage calculation test. Fishbone Diagram The fishbone diagram , also known as an Ishikawa diagram or a cause-and-effect dia- gram, is used to identify the many possible causes of a problem and any relationshipsamong the causes (Phillips & Simmonds, 2013). It provides a retrospective review ofChapter 7 Improving and Managing Safe and Quality Care 165 Figure 7-5 Bar chart.0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100% ADN BSN MSN DNP/PhDEducation Levels of Nurses Employed At XYZ Hospital by Gender Female Male3021_Ch07_141-173 16/01/17 3:24 PM Page 165events and can help nurse leaders and managers determine the root causes of a prob- lem. Fishbone diagrams are key tools used to conduct RCAs. They encourage the teamto look at all possible causes and contributing factors of an issue, not just the most ob-vious. The fishbone provides a graphic display of the relationship between an outcomeand possible factors, such as people, processes, equipment, environment, and man-agement. For example, a fishbone diagram would be used by nurse leaders and man-agers if they wanted to investigate a medication error or an event such as a patient'ssuicide. The fishbone allows the QI team to consider all possible causes of the event.Categories of factors that could cause a problem vary depending on the incident. Figure 7-7 illustrates a fishbone diagram and includes people, processes, equipment,environment, management, and materials, but these components are not set in stone.166 PART II PROMOTION OF PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY CARE Figure 7-6 Histogram.0510152025 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 100Number of Students (N=78) Raw Scores on TestStudent Grades on Dosage Calculations Test LEARNING ACTIVITY 7-2 Using a Fishbone Diagram for Central Line Infections Over the past 6 months, patients in the intensive care unit have experienced an increase in central line infections. The nurse leader and manager suspects that the increase is related to more central lines being inserted in the emergency department. A QI team is being formed to identify the root causes of central line infections. Discuss the following with classmates: Who should be on the QI team? Outline the steps in the QI process to use in this situation. What type of QI tools would be used to: Track central line infections Investigate possible causes of infections Identify areas for improvement How would the QI team implement an activity to improve the infection rate, andhow will the team know the activity worked?3021_Ch07_141-173 16/01/17 3:24 PM Page 166Flow Chart A flow chart helps clarify complex processes, shows blocks in activity in the process, and serves as a basis for designing new processes (IHI, 2016c). Flow charts provide a picture of the various steps in a sequential process and allow QI teams to under-stand an existing process, identify complexity in a process, identify non-value-added steps in a process, and develop ideas about how to improve a process. Nurseleaders and managers would use a flow chart to identify problematic areas in theprocess of admitting a patient. Figure 7-8 displays a flow chart related to the patientadmission process. Pareto Chart The Pareto chart resembles a bar chart in which the height of the bars represents frequency, and the bars are arranged on the horizontal axis in order from highestto lowest. The Pareto chart is designed to look at various causes of a specific prob-lem. Based on the 80/20 principle, the Pareto chart is a tool to help determine the\"small portion of causes that account for a large amount of the variance\" in aprocess (Boxer & Goldfarb, 2011, p. 151). Joseph Juran developed the Pareto chartto help managers determine where to focus improvement activities because it Chapter 7 Improving and Managing Safe and Quality Care 167 Figure 7-7 Fishbone diagram.Structure of Problem/Issue ErrorPEOPLE PROCESSFishbone Diagram (Cause and Effect) EQUIPMENT MATERIALSPossible contributing factors Possible contributing factorsPossible contributing factors Possible contributing factorsPossible contributing factorsPossible contributing factors Possible contributing factors Possible contributing factorsPossible contributing factors Possible contributing factorsPossible contributing factorsPossible contributing factors Possible contributing factorsPossible contributing factors Possible contributing factors ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT3021_Ch07_141-173 16/01/17 3:24 Page \"useful many.\" The Pareto chart visually shows areas that are most significant and provides information to help identify where tofocus improvement for the greatest impact. Nurse leaders and managers woulduse a Pareto chart when there are many causes of an issue, such as breaks in isolation procedures, but the QI team wants to focus on the most significant cause.Figure 7-9 illustrates a Pareto chart for identifying possible causes of medicationerrors on a unit during a specific period of time. Based on this chart, the \"vital168 PART II PROMOTION OF PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY CARE Doctor's Office - need for hospitalization determined Transport to Unit (ICU, CCU)Emergency admission?

These are the areas where QI should be focused. The QI tools presented can assist nurses at all levels with measuring processes and outcomes of care.

Journal of Nursing Administration, 44(10), S27-S37. Aim The aim of this study was to investigate how transformational leadership, safetyculture, and continuous QI initiatives are related to objective quality and patientsafety outcome measures. Methods Using a survey methodology, the investigators collected and compared data from204 hospitals in 48 states. They used a questionnaire that measured transformational3021_Ch07_141-173 16/01/17 3:24 PM Page 169170 PART II PROMOTION OF PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY CARE EXPLORING THE EVIDENCE 7-2\u2014cont'd SUMMARY Safety is a basic component of health-care quality. Because nurses are at the front- line of care, have the most contact with patients, and are the last line of defenseagainst medical errors, they have an integral role in discovering and correctingprocesses that can result in an adverse event. In addition, nurses can significantlyinfluence the quality of care provided and are essential members of the QI team.Nurse leaders and managers must promote a culture that focuses on patient andstaff safety by encouraging error reporting, error reduction, and patient safety(ANA, 2016). Nurse leaders and managers are responsible for evaluating the qualityand appropriateness of nursing care (ANA, 2016), and to do so, they must engagenurses in the QI process. SUGGESTED WEBSITES Agency for Healthcare Improvement Patient Safety Organization Program: www. pso.ahrq.gov leadership, safety climate, and continuous QI and compared findings with hospital- acquired infections and process quality scores from the Hospital Compare website.To test four hypotheses, they used Structural Equation Modeling. Key Findings Research findings supported three of the four hypotheses. Transformational lead-ership was positively associated with patient safety climate, process quality scoreswere positively associated with continuous quality improvement initiatives, andcontinuous quality initiatives were positively associated with process qualityscores. However, continuous quality improvement was associated with an increasein hospital-acquired infections, rather than the lower rates hypothesized. The in-vestigators suggest that preventing hospital-acquired infections requires a broadapproach, and continuous quality improvement in many hospitals may be focusedon improving business processes rather than patient safety. They also found thattransformational leadership was directly related to employees' perceptions of astrong safety climate. Implications for Nurse Leaders and Managers Transformational leadership is important to creating and sustaining a positivepatient safety climate. Nurse leaders and managers can use the findings of thisstudy to promote broad continuous quality initiatives and to foster a positive patient safety climate on their units and throughout the health-care organization.Nurse leaders and managers at all levels of an organization must play an activerole in creating a climate where staff members feel comfortable to voice safetyconcerns.3021_Ch07_141-173 16/01/17 3:24 PM Page 170ASQ Quality Tools A to www.asq.org/learn-about-quality/quality-tools.html Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Tools: www.ihi.org/resources/Pages/ Tools/default.aspx Robert W ood Johnson Foundation.

Nurses at all levels must have a good understand- ing of how health-care systems work to be able to function effectively within an organization and deliver safe and quality nursing care. Understanding the nuancesof health-care systems allows nurse leaders and managers to better navigate an organization, recognize the level of complexity, comprehend the need for changeand innovation, and, in turn, see how nurses best play a role in the environment.With knowledge of how different systems work, nurse leaders and managers canbetter facilitate compliance with health-care regulations, identify opportunities andthreats for strategic planning, and manage personnel and units and/or depart-ments effectively. In this chapter, the basic elements of a health-care organization are outlined, in- cluding their role in the continuum of care. In addition, organizational structuresand theories that provide the frameworks for today's health-care environment arediscussed. Knowledge, skills, and attitudes related to the following core competencies are included in this chapter: patient-centered care and quality improvement. BASIC ELEMENTS OF A HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATION Various types of health-care organizations providing different levels of care areneeded in today's society. The variety of care and services received by patients froma variety of health-care providers in a variety of settings constitutes a continuumof care. Continuum of care is defined as \"a concept involving a system that guides and tracks patients over time through a comprehensive array of health services span-ning all levels and intensity of care\" (Young, Clark, Kansky, & Pupo, 2014, para. 1).The continuum of care covers the delivery of health care over a period of time, asexpansive as from birth to end of life, and is important to ensure safe and qualitycare and to decrease fragmentation of care. Nurses at all levels need to develop an understanding of the continuum of care and the basic elements of health-care to integrate health promotion, injury preven-tion, disease prevention, and disease management elements into their nursing prac-tice (American Association of Colleges of Nursing [AACN], 2008). Nurse leadersand managers must be knowledgeable and develop necessary skills to coordinatethe care of patients with many other health-care providers and organizational unitsinvolved in providing care. Understanding the basic types of health-care organi-zations and the levels of services provided across them is the first step in achievinga continuum of care. For-Profit Versus Not-for-Profit Organizations Some health-care organizations are for-profit organizations, meaning they are owned by stockholders, shareholders, or corporate owners. Money brought in isreinvested into the organization to keep it running (e.g., in areas including main-tenance, expansion, purchasing of equipment and supplies) and to develop newservices. A for-profit organization must always have reserve funds to pay the cor-porate owners or the stockholders. As a result, funds may not always be readilyChapter 8 Health-Care Organizations 175 3021_Ch08_174-194 14/01/17 3:53 PM Page 175Figure 8-1 Where nurses work. (Adapted from Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, 2015.)available for certain purposes that can affect nurses and patient care. In contrast, not-for-profit organizations do not have stockholders or shareholders yet must also have funds available to run the organization. Possible sources of funding for not-for-profit organizations are public and/or government funding, grants, privatedonations, or a combination of these sources. A not-for-profit organization typicallyserves a large number of nonpaying patients. This can cause the organization tospend more money than it is bringing in. Additionally, a not-for-profit organizationmay have to cut services or make other changes to ensure a positive cash flow. Types of Health-Care Organizations Hospitals represent the largest type of health-care organization, and, in fact, morenurses work in hospitals than in any other type of health-care organization (Bureauof Labor Statistics, 2015). Other types of health-care organizations include extendedcare facilities, retirement and assisted living facilities, ambulatory care centers,home health care agencies, medical homes, psychiatric care facilities, and substanceabuse treatment facilities. See Figure 8-1 for a breakdown of the types of health-care organizations in which nurses work. Levels of Service Health-care organizations are frequently categorized according to the complexityof the level of care provided throughout the continuum, which can be primarycare, secondary care, or tertiary care. Primary care is the first line of defense and involves health promotion and illness prevention. In a primary care facility, thefocus is on health education and health screening. Examples of primary care facilities include health-care provider's offices, immunization centers, and wellness centers. Secondary care involves emergency care and acute care. In this environment, the focus is on diagnosis, treatment, and limiting disability. Exam-ples of secondary care facilities include hospitals, urgent care centers, ambula-tory care facilities, and birthing centers. Tertiary care involves restoration and rehabilitation. In this environment, the focus is on maintaining and improving (ifappropriate) the current state of health. Examples of tertiary care facilities are reha-bilitation centers, assisted living centers, long-term care facilities, and hospices. 176 PART II PROMOTION OF PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY CARE UnknownGovernmentHome STRUCTURE AND CULTURE, AND STRATEGIC PLANNING The structure and culture of a health-care organization need to be understood by nurse leaders and managers to ensure a safe and healthy work environment. Organizational Structure Organizational structure outlines who is accountable and responsible for the work in an organization and subsequently helps define working relationships. Health-care or-ganizations continue to be fairly traditional, with most having a hierarchical organi-zational structure and reflecting the classical principles of chain of command, unityof command, and span of control (Rundio & Wilson, 2013). Chain of command refers to a formal line of authority from the top to the bottom of the organization. Each unit isconnected to another, and reporting relationships are hierarchical (i.e., a unit's imme-diate manager reporting to the one above). Unity of command suggests that each individ- ual employee is accountable to only one manager, with expectations clearly definedand well understood (Rundio & Wilson, 2013, p. 15). Span of control defines a man- ager's scope of responsibility and reflects the number of employees who report to agiven manager. Theoretically, the goal is to accomplish the work of the organizationby dispersing responsibilities and duties equally so that one individual or unit is notoverburdened. Organizational charts visually represent these principles, with eachunit connected in a hierarchal manner. The goal of an organizational chart is to reflectformal relationships between and among units within an organization. Organizational structures can be centralized or decentralized. A centralized struc- ture, often referred to as tall (or hierarchical), is one in which the authority for decision making is held by a few individuals at the top level of management.Typically, the chief executive officer and administrators hold the highest levelin the organization. They have authority to hire and fire, make financial deci-sions, and implement change. Depending on the levels of management, someauthority may be delegated to those employees reporting to an administrator.In a centralized structure, there is minimal innovation or creativity, and problemsare dealt with by a few leaders and managers; this system sometimes results indelays in decision making. Communication flows from top to bottom and istightly controlled. Nurses may or may not participate in decision making in acentralized structure. Responsibilities of nurse leaders and managers vary de-pending on their position and level in the organization. Figure 8-2 illustrates acentralized org anizational chart. In a decentralized structure , often referred to as flat, authority and power for decision making are shared by a number of individuals across the organization. In this envi-ronment, problems can often be solved at the level where they occur. Typically, staffmembers are responsible for making decisions related to their areas of expertise.Communication flows from the bottom upward and between units. Nurses partic-ipate in decisions that affect their nursing practice and patient care. Nurse leadersand managers foster shared governance and teamwork and collaboration. A decen-tralized structure fosters autonomy at all levels. Figure 8-3 illustrates a decentralizedorganizational chart.

It is shaped by themission, vision, and philosophy of the organization and reflects its values and beliefs as well. The mission statement of an organization describes the organization's overall pur- pose. Being future oriented, the mission statement should reflect the direction toward which the organization intends to head. The vision statement reflects the image for the future the organization plans to create (Roussel, 2013, p. 343). Missionand vision statements often are created by top-level administration. However, whenall staff members are involved in developing mission and vision statements, theywill believe in their abilities and become committed to the organization (Roussel,2013; Rundio & Wilson, 2013). A philosophy is a statement of beliefs, values, concepts, and principles that reflect the ideas, convictions, and attitudes of the organization.The philosophy of an organization becomes the basis for operationalizing the mission and vision of the organization (Tuck, Harris, & Baliko, 2000). Nurse leaders and managers have a major responsibility to model the core values of the organization and ensure that the activities of their unit or department reflectthe vision, mission, and philosophy of the organization. The nursing mission, vision, and philosophy emerge from the organization's and should articulate thenature of the nurse's role, the values of nursing, what nursing should and will be,and what populations are served, as well as a purpose statement (Roussel, 2013).Additionally, the mission, vision, and philosophy of nursing should be known andunderstood by everyone within the organization including health-care providers,patients and families, and the community (Roussel, 2013). The ideal culture in a health-care environment is a culture of safety, as discussed in detail in Chapter 7. Strategic Planning Strategic planning is how an organization defines its future. It aligns an organizationwith defined goals and can be considered a roadmap for the future of an organization (Roussel, 2013; Schaffner, 2009). Strategic planning is defined as \"a contin- uous, systematic process of making risk-taking decisions today with the greatest pos-sible knowledge of their effects on the future; organizing efforts necessary to carryout these decisions and evaluating results of these decisions against expected out-come through reliable feedback mechanisms\" (Drucker, 1974, p. 125). Nurse leadersand managers participate in strategic planning at the organizational and departmentor unit level. Strategic planning forecasts the future success of an organization andbegins by ensuring that its mission, vision, and philosophy are up to date (Conway-Morana, 2009). Steps of the strategic planning process are displayed in Box 8-1. A primary goal of strategic planning is to maximize organizational perform- ance. One strategy used in the planning process is evaluation of the organization'sstrengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, known as SWOT analysis.SWOT analysis can assist nurse leaders and managers in improving care deliveryChapter 8 Health-Care Organizations 179 3021_Ch08_174-194 14/01/17 3:53 PM Page 179by identifying the strengths of the unit and/or staff, areas for improvement, and opportunities for facilitating positive change (Roussel, 2013). The first step in aSWOT analysis is to collect data, which may include staff characteristics, unit census, patient characteristics, and more. Next, the data are analyzed and sortedinto one of the four categories: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Organization or unit strengths and opportunities are viewed as positive or helpful,whereas weaknesses and threats are considered negative or harmful. Additionally,strengths and weaknesses originate internally, whereas opportunities and threatsoriginate externally. Table 8-1 displays a SWOT matrix commonly used in a SWOTanalysis. Nurse leaders and managers lead strategic planning, conduct SWOT analyses, and provide strategic direction for their department and units (American Organization of Nurse Executives [AONE], 2011). Typically, nurse leaders andmanagers also contribute to organizational strategic planning.

Further, nurse leaders and managers are ac-countable for communicating, implementing, and evaluating strategic plans.Employees must have the necessary skills to participate in developing and de-signing care delivery models that support the organization's strategic visions(ANA, 2016). Nurse leaders and managers are critical to ensuring that the nurs-ing strategic goals are in line with the organization's goals. Given the current state of health care and the focus on cost containment, opera- tional efficiencies, and safety and quality mandates, some believe that strategicplanning will need to shift from a traditional business approach to a more futuristicapproach. Impeding this change is the reality that many health-care stakeholderscontinue to be entrenched in an outdated mindset that focuses on financial rewardsfor providing health-care services to the sick, rather than promoting health andpreventing disease (Luzinski, 2014). The enactment of the Patient Protection andAffordable Care Act of 2010 placed pressure on health-care organizations to im-prove their patients' experiences, the safety and quality of care, employee culture,and financial status. This change requires a more futuristic approach to planning,such as using strategic foresight (Luzinski, 2014). Although new to health care,strategic foresight has been used for years in other industries. Strategic foresight is seeing the relevant opportunities that could emerge from the future and strategiz-ing how to make the most of them. Leaders must shift their focus from the currentexisting state of the organization to envisioning the organization 10 years into thefuture (Luzinski, 2014). Futures thinking and foresight are seen as prerequisite competencies for success in the dynamic health-care system (Freed & McLaughlin, 2011; Luzinski, 2014). Futures thinking entails bringing vision to the planning process, seeing the relevant opportunities that are emerging, and creating a desired future. Nurse leaders andmanagers need to become self-aware of their current mental model and embracechanging to futures thinking. Four practices that \"create a culture where the futurecan be assessed and leveraged\" are collaborating, reflecting, envisioning, and strate-gizing (Emelo, 2011, p. 8). Collaboration is needed because foresight emerges fromthe interactive vision of people throughout the organization. Collaborating withpeople with differing perspectives helps leaders better reflect on the past, evaluatecurrent data and trends, and thoughtfully consider possible future options. Fore-sight embraces the past and requires leaders to reflect on previous performance to identify patterns that may indicate actions for the future. Reflecting on the past LEARNING ACTIVITY 8-1 Conducting a SWOT Analysis Think about a personal area in your life you would like to change (i.e., beginning an exercise program). Use a SWOT analysis matrix and identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to the change. 3021_Ch08_174-194 14/01/17 3:53 PM Page 181allows all involved parties to envision the future. Once future opportunities are identified, leaders must strategize approaches to bring the opportunities into reality(Emelo, 2011). Nurses have always been prepared for the future, but now nurse educators are called to help nursing students develop futures thinking. Thinking for thefuture will assist all nurses as well as nurse leaders and managers to \"make decisions in future-oriented ways, develop increased awareness and sensitivityto multiple influences and their interactions that have bearing on the future, takeresponsibility to build and shape desired futures (their own futures, the profes-sion's future, and the future of the health care system)\" (Freed & McLaughlin,2011, p. 177). REGULATION AND ACCREDITATION Nurses at all levels must understand the complex health-care system and the impact of policy, regulations, and accreditation on these systems (AACN, 2008).Nurse leaders and managers are responsible for educating staff on legislative andregulatory processes and interpret the impact on nursing and health-care organi-zations (AONE, 2011). Regulation Health care is a highly regulated industry. Health-care regulatory policies directlyand indirectly influence nursing practice and the nature and functioning of thehealth-care system (AACN, 2008). Regulations are developed and implemented byfederal, state, and local governments, as well as private organizations, and can bevery complex and difficult to understand (Mensik, 2014). Regulations and policiescan affect the quality of patient care, the workplace environment, the availability ofresources, and finances. Nurse leaders and managers need to stay current regardingfederal and state laws and regulations that can affect patient care (AONE, 2011). Accreditation Nurses must have a basic understanding of not only the legislative and regulatoryprocesses but also the accreditation process. Accreditation ensures that health-careorganizations meet certain national quality standards. When health-care organiza-tions are accredited, it means the accrediting agency has conferred deeming statuson the organization and the organization has met Medicare and Medicaid certifi-cation standards (Shi & Singh, 2008). Although accreditation is voluntary, Medicare,Medicaid, and most insurance companies require accreditation by The Joint Commission or the DNV GL through state regulatory agencies to provide funds toan organization. State governments also oversee the licensure and certification ofhealth-care organizations. State standards address the \"physical plant's compliancewith building codes, fire safety, climate, control, space allocations, and sanitation\"(Shi & Singh, 2008, p. 320). State departments of health certify health-care organi-zations through periodic inspections. Certification entitles health-care organizationsto receive Medicare and Medicaid funding. 182 PART II PROMOTION OF PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY CARE 3021_Ch08_174-194 14/01/17 3:53 PM Page 182The Joint Commission The mission of The Joint Commission (TJC) is \"to continuously improve health care for the public, in collaboration with other stakeholders, by evaluating health careorganizations and inspiring them to excel in providing safe and effective care ofthe highest quality and value\" (TJC, 2015, para. 2). TJC accredits more than 20,000health-care organizations in the United States, and the international arm of TJC accredits health-care agencies in more than 90 countries. TJC accreditation can beearned by many types of health-care organizations, including hospitals, doctor'soffices, nursing homes, office-based surgery centers, behavioral health treatmentfacilities, and providers of home care services (TJC, 2015). DNV GL DNV GL was created in a merger between Det Norske Veritas (Norway)and Germanischer Lloyd (Germany). The international organization partners withNational Integrated Accreditation for Healthcare Organizations (NIAHO) to pro-vide accreditation for health-care agencies. The NIAHO standards are based onMedicare Conditions of Participation standards and the International Organizationfor Standardization (ISO) 9001 quality management standards. The ISO 9001 stan-dards provide a framework for organizations to implement quality managementsystems that will streamline processes, maintain efficiency, and increase produc-tivity (ACS Registrars, 2014, para. 1). More than 500 hospitals now have accredita-tion through DNV GL (DNV GL, 2015). Magnet Recognition Program In 1983, the American Academy of Nursing task force on nursing practice in hospi-tals conducted a study to determine what attracted nurses to hospitals (AmericanNurses Credentialing Center [ANCC], 2016e). The study determined that 41 of 163 hospitals could be considered Magnet hospitals\u2014in other words, they possessed qualities that attracted and retained nurses (ANCC, 2016e). A total of 14 qualitieswere identified that distinguished these hospitals from others, and these qualitiesbecame known as the \"Forces of Magnetism\" (Table 8-2). Building on this study, theMagnet Hospital Recognition Program for Excellence in Nursing was approved bythe American Nurses Association in December 1990 (ANCC, 2016e).

Nursing leaders, at all organizational levels, convey a strongsense of advocacy and support for the staff and for the patient. The resultsof quality leadership are evident in nursing practice at the patient's side.Organizational structures are generally flat, rather than tall, and decentral-ized decision making prevails. The organizational structure is dynamic and responsive to change. Strong nursing representation is evident in theorganizational committee structure. Executive-level nursing leaders serveat the executive level of the organization. The chief nursing officer typicallyreports directly to the chief executive officer. The organization has a functioning and productive system of shared decision making.Health-care organization and nursing leaders create an environment supporting participation. Feedback is encouraged, valued, and incorpo-rated from the staff at all levels. Nurses serving in leadership positions are visible, accessible, and committed to effective communication.Salaries and benefits are competitive. Creative and flexible staffing modelsthat support a safe and healthy work environment are used. Personnelpolicies are created with direct care nurse involvement. Significant oppor-tunities for professional growth exist in administrative and clinical tracks.Personnel policies and programs support professional nursing practice,work/life balance, and the delivery of quality care.There are models of care that give nurses responsibility and authority forthe provision of direct patient care. Nurses are accountable for their ownpractice as well as the coordination of care. The models of care (i.e., primary nursing, case management, family-centered, district, and holistic)provide for the continuity of care across the continuum. The models takeinto consideration patients' unique needs and provide skilled nurses andadequate resources to accomplish desired outcomes.Quality is the systematic driving force for nursing and the organization.Nurses serving in leadership positions are responsible for providing an environment that positively influences patient outcomes. There is a pervasive perception among nurses that they provide high-quality care to patients.The organization possesses structures and processes for the measurement of quality and programs for improving the quality of care and services within the organization.The health-care organization provides adequate resources, support, andopportunities for the use of experts, particularly advanced practice nurses.The organization promotes involvement of nurses in professional organiza-tions and among peers in the community.Autonomous nursing care is the ability of a nurse to assess and providenursing actions as appropriate for patient care based on competence, professional expertise, and knowledge. The nurse is expected to practiceautonomously, consistent with professional standards. Independent judgment is expected within the context of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approaches to patient, resident, or client care.Forces Description 1.Quality of Nursing Leadership 2.Organizational Structure 3.Management Style 4.Personnel Policies and Programs 5.Professional Models of Care 6.Quality of Care 7.Quality Improvement 8.Consultation and Resources 9.Autonomy3021_Ch08_174-194 14/01/17 3:53 PM Page 184of Washington Medical Center in Seattle, Washington, became the first ANCC Magnet-designated organization, in 1994. Since then, the Magnet Recognition Program has expanded to include long-term care facilities and health-care organizations in-ternationally (ANCC, 2016e). As of 2015, about 7% of all hospitals in the UnitedStates had achieved Magnet recognition (ANCC, 2016d). Magnet recognition is a credential that organizations earn in recognition for qual- ity patient care, nursing excellence, and innovations in professional nursing practice(ANCC, 2016f). Organizations recognized as Magnet organizations must meet threegoals (para. 8): 1.Promote quality in a setting that supports professional practice. 2.Identify excellence in the delivery of nursing services to patients or residents. 3.Disseminate best practices in nursing services. Chapter 8 Health-Care Organizations 185 Table 8-2 Forces of Magnetism\u2014cont'd From ANCC, 2016c.Forces Description Relationships are established within and among all types of health-care organizations and other community organizations, to develop strong partnerships that support improved client outcomes and the health of thecommunities they serve.Professional nurses are involved in educational activities within the organi-zation and community. Students from a variety of academic programs arewelcomed and supported in the organization; contractual arrangementsare mutually beneficial. There is a development and mentoring programfor staff preceptors for all levels of students (e.g., including students, newgraduates, experienced nurses). In all positions, staff members serve asfaculty and preceptors for students from a variety of academic programs.There is a patient education program that meets the diverse needs of patients in all the care settings of the organization.The services provided by nurses are characterized as essential by othermembers of the health-care team. Nurses are viewed as integral to the health-care organization's ability to provide patient care. Nursing effectively influences systemwide processes.Collaborative working relationships within and among the disciplines arevalued. Mutual respect is based on the premise that all members of thehealth-care team make essential and meaningful contributions in theachievement of clinical outcomes. Conflict management strategies are inplace and are used effectively, when indicated.The health-care organization values and supports the personal and professional growth and development of staff. In addition to quality orientation and in-service education addressed in Force 11 (Nurses asTeachers), emphasis is placed on career development services. Programsthat promote formal education, professional certification, and career development are evident. Competency-based clinical and leadership ormanagement development is promoted, and adequate human and fiscalresources for all professional development programs are provided.10.Community and the Health-care Organization 11.Nurses as 3:53 PM Page 185The ANCC integrated the 14 Forces of Magnetism into the following five model components, which form a framework of excellence in nursing practice and make up the Magnet Model (ANCC, 2016a): 1.Transformational leadership: Nursing leaders at all levels of a Magnet-recognized organization must use futures thinking and demonstrate advocacy and support on behalf of staff and patients to transform values, beliefs, and behaviors. Nurseleaders and managers must be transformational and lead staff \"where they needto be in order to meet the demands of the future\" (para. 6). The Forces of Magnetism represented in this element are Quality of Nursing Leadership andManagement Style. 2.Structural empowerment: Nurse leaders and managers at all levels of a Magnet organization are influential and participate in an innovative environment whereprofessional practice flourishes. Nurse leaders and managers must develop, direct, and empower staff to participate in achieving organizational goals anddesired outcomes. The Forces of Magnetism represented in this element are Organizational Structure; Personnel Policies and Programs; Community and theHealth-Care Organization; Image of Nursing; and Professional Development(para. 8). 3.Exemplary professional practice: Exemplary professional practice in Magnet- recognized organizations is evidenced by a comprehensive understanding of therole of nursing, strong intraprofessional and interprofessional teamwork, andongoing application of new knowledge evidence in practice. Nurse leaders andmanagers must promote interprofessional collaboration and teamwork. TheForces of Magnetism represented include Professional Models of Care, Consul-tation and Resources, Autonomy, Nurses as Teachers, and Interdisciplinary Relationships (para. 9). 4.New knowledge, innovations, and improvements: Magnet-recognized organizations embrace transformational leadership and foster professional empowerment.Nurse leaders and managers must focus on redesigning and redefining practiceto be successful in the future. The Force of Magnetism represented is QualityImprovement (para. 10). 5.Empirical quality results: The empirical measurement of quality outcomes re- lated to nursing leadership and clinical practice in Magnet-recognized organ-izations is imperative. Currently, organizations have some structure andprocesses in place. However, the focus in the future must shift from \"What doyou do?\" or \"How do you do it?\" to \"What difference have you made?\" Nurseleaders and managers must participate in establishing quantitative bench-marks for measuring outcomes related to nursing, the workforce, patients, con-sumers, and the organization. The Force of Magnetism represented is Qualityof Care (paras. 12 to 14). Achieving Magnet status benefits the organization and all stakeholders. Further, Magnet-recognized organizations are able to recruit and retain top-notch nursing talent; improve patient care, patient safety, and staff safety; increase patient satis-faction; foster a collaborative culture; advance nursing standards and professionalpractice; and improve business stability and financial success (ANCC, 2016f). Magnet designation is associated with many positive outcomes for patients and186 PART II PROMOTION OF PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY CARE 3021_Ch08_174-194 14/01/17 3:53 PM Page 186nurses (Ulrich, Buerhaus, Donelan, Norman, & Dittus, 2007). Higher overall patient satisfaction, lower morbidity and mortality rates, decreased numbers of pressureulcers, patient safety, and higher-quality care are evident in Magnet hospitals(ANCC, 2016b). Nurses report job satisfaction, autonomy and control over nursingpractice, fewer injuries, and less burnout than do nurses working in non-Magnetorganizations (Ulrich et al., 2007). Health-care consumers are becoming more awareof the Magnet designation and recognize a Magnet hospital as one with high-quality nursing care. The US News & World Report uses the Magnet designation as a primary competence indicator to rank the best medical centers in 16 specialties.In fact, in 2013, 15 of the 18 medical centers on the US News Best Hospitals in America Honor Roll were Magnet organizations (ANCC, 2016f).Chapter 8 Health-Care Organizations 187 EXPLORING THE EVIDENCE 8-1 ContinuedChen, J., Koren, M. E., Munroe, D. J., & Yao, P . (2014). Is the hospital's magnet status linked to HCAHPS scores? Journal of Nursing Care Quality , 29(4), 327-335. Aim The aims of this study were: 1. To identify the differences in HCAHPS scores between Magnet and non-Magnet hospitals. 2. To assess the extent to which Magnet status and other variables among hospital and nursing characteristics contributed to the HCAHPS scores. Methods This study was a cross-sectional, secondary analysis of data from the Illinois Hospital Report Card. The database houses more than 175 indicators of quality,safety, utilization, and charges for specific procedures and medical conditionsamong Illinois hospitals. The study included all adult acute care hospitals in Illinois with 100 beds or more, available results of HCAHPS, nursing hours per patient day (NHPPD), RN nursing hours per patient day, and RN turnover rate in 2009. The sample consisted of 110 hospitals or 58.8% of total adult acute care hospitals in Illinois.The researchers analyzed data reported between January 2009 and December 2009.Data were analyzed using independent samples t test, Pearson 2, and linear multiple regression. Key Findings Magnet hospitals were significantly more likely to: 1. be teaching hospitals. 2. have a larger number of beds.3. have lower percentages of African American patients and Medicare payments. 4. have more NHPPD and RN-NHPPD than the non-Magnet hospitals.3021_Ch08_174-194 14/01/17 3:53 PM Page 187188 PART II PROMOTION OF PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY CARE EXPLORING THE EVIDENCE 8-1\u2014cont'd ORGANIZATIONAL THEORIES Health-care organizations are called to deliver safe, timely, effective, equitable, evidence-based, patient-centered care. To understand how health-care or ganizations function in today's complicated health-care landscape, nurse leaders and managersneed to be knowledgeable about some theoretical elements that shape organiza-tions and explain organizational behavior. In general, organizations are complex,unpredictable, ambiguous, and, at times, deceptive. As a result, they can be difficultto manage (Bolman & Deal, 2008). Nurse leaders and managers who are able to seebeyond the complexity and apply appropriate organizational theories can influenceorganizational effectiveness. Organizational theory can provide a framework to bring Magnet hospitals received higher scores than non-Magnet hospitals in all of the seven HCAHPS measures with significant differences in all measures, except for \"patients always received help as soon as they wanted.\" Magnet status of the hospital was the second important contributor to the HCAHPS scores, explaining 5% to 13% of the variance in six of the seven HCAHPS measures. Again, the only measure that it did not explain was \"patientsalways received help as soon as they wanted\". The positive association between Magnet status and the HCAHPS scores was most significant in the following two measures: 1. \"Percentage of patients highly satisfied.\" 2. \"Patients would definitely recommend this hospital to friends and family.\" Hospitals with higher RN-NHPPD were more likely to receive higher scores in \"patients always received help as soon as they wanted.\" Hospitals with lower RNturnover rate were more likely to receive higher scores in \"percentage of patientshighly satisfied,\" \"patients would definitely recommend this hospital to friendsand family,\" and \"staff always explained about medicines.\" Implications for Nurse Leaders and Managers The findings of this study support the need to consider RN-NHPPD and RNturnover rates as significant contributors to positive scores on some HCAHPSmeasures. In addition, this study suggests that other factors embedded in Magnethospitals positively influence HCAHPS scores. The investigators suggest that anenvironment that supports professional practice and environmental factors such as structural empowerment and adequate access to support and resources can promote quality of care and improve patient satisfaction. Nurse leaders and managers, even those not working in Magnet hospitals, can use these findings to create a work environment that embraces Magnet characteris-tics with the goals of improving the quality of nursing care and patient satisfactionoutcomes. 3021_Ch08_174-194 14/01/17 3:53 PM Page 188people together to accomplish work (Roussel, 2013). An organizational theory is not one size fits all. In fact, organizational administrators, leaders, and managersmay vacillate among various theoretical concepts based on organizational behavior.Various schools of thought about leadership, management, and human behaviormake up the various organizational theories (Mensik, 2014). Classical Organization Theories Organizational theories became prevalent during the industrial age, when large or-ganizations were first developed; before this period in history, most businesses werefamily owned and run. Max Weber, a German sociologist, believed that a more formalapproach was needed to foster success in the new organizations of the late 1800s andearly 1900s. In turn, he developed the first organizational theory, the bureaucratic man-agement theory, which focused on the structure of formal organizations, the authorityof management, and rules and regulations to improve the success of an organization.He believed that a bureaucratic structure would protect employees from arbitrary de-cisions from supervisors and promote opportunities for employees to become spe-cialists in their work area (Max Weber's theory of bureaucracy, 2009). A subsequentChapter 8 Health-Care Organizations 189 Hospital Consumer Assessment of Health-care Providers and Systems In the past, hospitals collected data on patient satisfaction for internal use and focused on clinical outcomes as the primary measure of effectiveness and quality. Although many hospitals collected data on patient satisfaction,there was no national standard for collecting and publicly reporting the information. Health care is moving from adisease-focused model of care to patient-centered care. Along with this transition, patient satisfaction with carehas become an important indicator of quality health care. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 requires implementation of value-based purchasing (VBP), which bases Medicare reimbursement to hospitals onquality of care. To measure patients' perceptions of their health-care experience, the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey was implemented in 2006 by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS, 2015). The HCAHPS allows valid comparisons across hospitals locally, regionally, and nationally, and it has three major goals (CMS, 2015, para. 2): 1.The standardized survey and implementation protocol produces data that allow objective and meaningful comparisons of hospitals on topics that are important to patients and consumers. 2.Public reporting of HCAHPS results creates new incentives for hospitals to improve quality of care. 3.Public reporting enhances accountability in health care by increasing transparency of the quality of hospitalcare provided in return for the public investment. HCAHPS scores based on four consecutive quarters of patient surveys are publicly reported annually on the Medicare Web site (www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare). A major incentive for hospitals to work toward high quality of care is that hospital payment from CMS through the VBP program is linked to performance on a set of quality measures related to HCAHPS scores (CMS, 2015). Hospitals are working toward identifying and implementing changes that can increase patient satisfactionoutcomes. Studies indicate that quality nursing care is a predictor of higher HCAHPS scores (Chen et al., 2014;Kutney-Lee et al., 2009; Otani, Herrmann, & Kurz, 2010; Wolosin, Ayala, & Fulton, 2012). Additionally, one studyfound a significant link between Magnet hospitals and higher HCAHPS scores (Chen et al., 2014).3021_Ch08_174-194 14/01/17 3:53 PM Page 189theory was the principles of management theory, developed by the engineer Henri Fayol, who is best known for identifying management functions of planning,organization, command, coordination, and control\u2014all of which are still used today(Krenn, 2011). The scientific management theory was developed by another engineer, Frederick Taylor, who used scientific knowledge and mathematical formulas to manage the amount of work that could be accomplished in a specific time period andimprove productivity. Taylor introduced the concept of using financial rewards to increase productivity (Dininni, 2011). In the early 20th century, organizational theories began to explore the underlying differences in human behavior, characteristics, and roles of the work group. MaryParker Follett was a theorist who embraced human relations theory and developedbasic principles of participatory and humanistic management. She advocated forthe principles of negotiation, conflict resolution, and power sharing (Dininni, 2010).All the classical theories were developed in an effort to improve overall organiza-tional management and productivity, as well as define the functions of the managerand create a formal structure for solving problems in the organization. Contemporary Organizational Theories Contemporary organizational theories were built on the classical theories, and,in fact, elements of classical theories are present in many organizations today.However, modern organizations demand new organizational structures to survive as they discover that the linear theories of the past are not effective. Contemporary organizational theories need to reflect patterns, purposes, andprocesses and require a continuum-based, person- and outcome-driven systemdesign (Porter-O'Grady & Malloch, 2013). Emerging theories are cyclical ratherthan linear and require organizations to react with speed and flexibility. Contem-porary organizational theories that can be used to understand the complexity ofhealth-care organizations include the general systems theory, complexity theory,and learning organization theory. General Systems Theory The primary premise of the general systems theory is that \"the whole is greater than the sum of its parts\" (Mensik, 2014, p. 38). The theory is based on two types of sys-tems: an open system, which interacts with systems inside and outside; and a closedsystem, which has little or no interaction outside. Health-care organizations areseen as complex open systems in a dynamic state of flux. Open systems are com-posed of interrelated elements including inputs, throughputs, and outputs. The in-puts are resources such as staff, patients, equipment, and supplies. The work of theorganization is the throughput. The outcome of the work is the output. In the nurs-ing environment, input is nursing personnel and their knowledge, skills, beliefs,and education; throughput involves the management of patient care by nurses; andoutput consists of patient care outcomes (Roussel, 2013). The system is a constantcycle of input, throughput, and output. For example, a hospital is an open system, and within the hospital are depart- ments or units, the subsystems (the laboratory, pharmacy, radiology, various nursing190 PART II PROMOTION OF PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY CARE 3021_Ch08_174-194 14/01/17 3:53 PM Page 190units, and so on). The overall effectiveness of the organization relies on the interde- pendent functioning of the subsystems. Open subsystems have permeable bound-aries and are in constant interaction with other subsystems. In contrast, closedsubsystems do not interact with other subsystems. Nurse leaders and managers need to be flexible and open to new ideas to main- tain the nursing unit as part of the open system. A nurse leader or manager whoworks in a closed-system unit is overly focused on internal functions and does notrecognize that the unit is part of the larger system. This thinking can negatively impact the overall functioning of the organization. By being open to the system,nurse leaders and managers can maximize the functioning of the unit and enhancepatient outcomes (Mensik, 2014). Complexity Theory Complexity theory is derived from the general systems theory, as well as physics, and it suggests that relationships are the key to everything (Mensik, 2014). Some keyconcepts of complexity theory are attractors, patterns, nonlinearity, self-organization,and emergence. Attractors are points of attraction that describe behavior in a complex system in which patterns of energy attract more energy (Crowell, 2011,p. 20). As attractors interrelate in many different nonlinear ways, self-organizationoccurs, and unexpected new ideas or structures emerge. Hierarchical structureswith top-down management approaches are no longer effective in the complexityof health care today. Patient care involves numerous processes with multiple factorsthat influence outcomes in various ways. At any given time, it is impossible to pre-dict patient outcomes with 100% accuracy because many of the factors that influ-ence patients' responses are unknown. Nurse leaders and managers need to abandon linear, controlling, orderly, and predictable approaches to management. Instead, they must embrace the complexityof health care, patients, staff, and the work environment to promote a relationship-oriented structure that is adaptable, self-organizing, and self-renewing. Nurse leadersand managers face situations daily in which stability and instability are present atthe same time (Crowell, 2011). In this paradox, nurse leaders and managers mustbalance three areas of tension in their roles. First, the nurse leader and managermust be efficient and effective, which involves managing the relationship betweenresource inputs and clinical outputs. Nurse leaders and managers are called to do more with less and manage staffing, skill mix, and patient care process whileensuring that safe, effective, evidence-based nursing care is delivered, all in com-pliance with regulations and professional standards. Second, nurse leaders andmanagers are ultimately accountable for the knowledge and competency of nursingstaff and for the relational aspects of nursing care. Finally, nurse leaders and man-agers are responsible for stability and change, by balancing the need to ensure thatpatient care activities are on track and predictable with the drive for innovationand change needed for safe nursing practice (Crowell, 2011, p. 64). Nurse leadersand managers must constantly monitor the balance between stability and completechaos to maximize variety and creativity within the system (Porter-O'Grady & Malloch, 2010). Further, nurse leaders and managers must focus on outcomes, develop fluid roles, and be able to act with speed and adaptability through chaos. Chapter 8 Health-Care Organizations 191 3021_Ch08_174-194 14/01/17 3:53 PM Page 191Learning Organization Theory The learning organization theory was first described by Peter Senge (1990), who suggested that to excel, future organizations will need to \"discover how to tap people's commitment and capacity to learn at all levels in an organization\" (p. 4).He called on leaders to move away from traditional authoritarian \"controllingorganizations\" and instead create learning organizations. Senge (1990) defineda learning organization as an \"organization where people continually expand their capacity to create the results they truly desire, where new and expansive patternsof thinking are nurtured, where collective aspiration is set free, and where peopleare continually learning how to learn together\" (p. 3). Senge (1990) identifiedfive disciplines that organizations need to adopt and practice to become learningorganizations: 1.Systems thinking: The understanding that everything is connected and interdependent 2.Personal mastery: The development of high-level personal proficiency, involv- ing \"the discipline of continually clarifying and deepening our personal vision, of focusing our energies, of developing patience, and of seeing realityobjectively\" (p. 7) 3.Mental models: Deeply ingrained assumptions that influence how a person understands and reacts to the world; understanding current mental modelsthrough reflection and inquiry, resulting in awareness of one's attitudes and perceptions and helping avoid jumping to conclusions and assumptions 4.Building shared vision: The establishment of a \"mutual purpose\" (p. 32) that fosters genuine commitment to the vision and organizational goals, rather thancompliance 5.Team learning: Involving dismissal of assumptions, free-flowing exchange of meaning that allows group members to discover insights they would not attainindividually, and a focus on working toward common goals Members of a learning organization are continually practicing the five disci- plines and are continually learning. Nurse leaders and managers can support a learning organization by involving staff in problem solving and decision making,promoting interprofessional and intraprofessional teamwork, improving com-munication, and empowering staff. In the quest to deliver safe and quality patient care, health-care organizations must seek continuous learning and quality.A learning organization is no longer an ideal but an imperative (Glaser & Overhage, 2013). SUMMARY Health-care organizations are complex systems that are constantly changing and that are moving away from being disease focused to patient centered.Nurses at all levels must understand the basic makeup of these systems as well as the role that organizational structure and culture, regulation and accred-itation, and organizational theories play in the delivery of safe and quality evidence-based care. 192 PART II PROMOTION OF PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY CARE 3021_Ch08_174-194 14/01/17 3:53 PM Page 192SUGGESTED WEBSITE Hospital statements.html REFERENCES ACS Registrars.

Describe the nurse leaders and managers' role in using information technology and informatics.3021_Ch09_195-210 14/01/17 3:53 PM Page 195Nurses deal with volumes of information on a daily basis. Safe and quality nurs- ing care relies on a nurse's ability to obtain adequate and appropriate infor- mation for effective decision making. Part of this includes development of basic computer literacy and information management skills to support all aspects ofnursing practice. Nurse leaders and managers must understand how to integrate nursing infor- matics and health information technology (IT) to ensure the delivery of safe andquality nursing care. They must recognize the importance of nursing data in im-proving practice, monitoring health-care and patient outcome trends, makingjudgments based on those trends, evaluating and revising patient care processes,and collaborating with others in the development of nursing systems (AmericanNurses Association [ANA], 2015; American Organization of Nurse Executives[AONE], 2011). Nursing informatics integrates nursing science, computer science, information sci- ence, and IT to manage and communicate data, information, knowledge, and wisdom(e.g., appropriate use of knowledge to solve human problems) in nursing practice(ANA, 2008, p. 92). Although a relatively new specialty in nursing, informatics is essential to improving patient care and meeting regulatory requirements. This chapter describes the basic elements of informatics and IT as well as pro- vides a brief overview of some of the more technical aspects. Various legislativeand regulatory requirements related to the advancement of informatics and thecritical role informatics plays in the delivery of safe and quality patient care arediscussed. Also presented are common information systems employed in healthcare and the secure use of electronic health records and information systems. Finally, how nurse leaders and managers facilitate the use of IT by staff to improvework efficiency, reduce costs, foster effective communication, and enhance the qual-ity and safety of patient care are discussed. Knowledge, skills, and attitudes related to the following core competencies are included in this chapter: teamwork and collaboration, informatics, and safety. UNDERSTANDING NURSING INFORMATICS To discuss nursing informatics, an understanding of common elements in the spe-cialty is important, as is an at least cursory understanding of the more technicalaspects. Basic Elements of Informatics Information systems are any systems, technology-based or otherwise, that store, process, and manage information at both the individual level and the organiza-tional level. The two major types of information systems are administrative andclinical. Administrative systems encompass both administrative and financial sys-tems. Vendors provide either a suite of applications within a single system to satisfythe organization's patient care needs or best of breed systems, which are designedfor a specific specialty and do not tend to integrate well with other systems. Although most information systems are purchased from a vendor, an infor- mation system may be a home-grown system as well. Most organizations use a196 PART II PROMOTION OF PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY CARE 3021_Ch09_195-210 14/01/17 3:53 PM Page 196vendor-developed system because of the time required to develop a home-grown system. Vendor systems do allow for varying degrees of customization. System acquisition is the process of obtaining an information system. The doc- ument that initiates this process with the vendor is a request for information (RFI)form from the vendor or a request for proposal (RFP) form, depending on the or-ganization. The vendor provides details about the information system in both theseprocesses. The format varies. The selection process extends until the contract issigned for the purchase of the system. Activities that take place during this phaseinclude establishing the steering committee, developing goals and objectives forthe system, determining system requirements, evaluating vendor proposals, con-ducting cost-benefit analysis, holding vendor demonstrations, and conducting con-tract negotiations (Wager, Lee, & Glaser, 2013). The purchase of the information system should be well integrated into the strate- gic plan for the organization. An information system provides an infrastructure forthe organization and requires resources for development, maintenance, and even-tual retirement. Because it is such a large investment, the selection of the informa-tion system should be a thoughtful decision, and it is essential that the processincludes input from the members of the organization, including nurses. Once the system is delivered, the life of the system begins. The system develop- ment life cycle (SDLC) refers to the life of the system. The phases of the SDLC areplanning and analysis, design, implementation, and support and evaluation(Wager, Lee, & Glaser, 2013), as described in Table 9-1. Nurse leaders and managers must be involved in all aspects of the process. They must be included from the beginning and have active roles in the acquisition of in-formation systems, as well as all phases of the SDLC. Information technology (IT) combines computer technology with data and telecom- munications technologies to provide solutions to the health-care industry. Someexamples of the way IT supports safe and quality patient care are through 1) pro-viding cues in the tools that are used for documentation that align with nursingbest practice; 2) providing data elements for data collection; and 3) real-time displayof pertinent patient information. Nursing informatics facilitates decision making in all nursing roles through the use of information systems and technology. An essential part of nursing Chapter 9 Information Technology for Safe and Quality Patient Care 197 Table 9-1 Phases of the System Development Lifecycle From Wager, K. A., Lee F. W., & Glaser, J. P .

Patient records are needed for communication, legal documentation, and billing and reimbursement (Wager,Lee, & Glaser, 2013). Electronic records improve research and quality manage-ment, metrics, data quality, and access to data that support population health.The three most common types of electronic records are the electronic medicalrecord (EMR), the electronic health record (EHR), and the personal health record(PHR). All of these electronic records contain medical information and detailsabout the care provided to the patient. Many people use the terms electronic medical record and electronic health record interchangeably; however, there is a difference between these technologies. The electronic medical record (EMR) is the electronic record of a patient that is used by a single organization. The electronic health record (EHR) is used by more than one organization, provides information throughout the continuum of care, and can be shared by other organizations.The EHR also provides interoperability among systems or locations (Sewell,2016). This means that EHR information can be accessed from more than one location or organization. The personal health record (PHR) is an electronic form of a patient's medical record that the patient can take with him or her or send to a health-care provider (Hebda & Czar 2009). The patient manages the PHR, including setting up, accessing, and updating the record (Wager, Lee, & Glaser,2013). The Institute of Medicine (IOM; 2003) describes eight core functions of an EHR: 1) health and information data, 2) result management, 3) order manage-ment, 4) decision support, 5) electronic communications and connectivity, 6) pa-tient support, 7) administrative processes and reporting, and 8) reporting andpopulation health. The strength of the data in an EHR can be augmented throughthe use of tools for financials and clinical decision support. These tools providethe ability to compare or combine data from clinical, financial, and administra-tive sources, thus supplying an added benefit to the organization. Dependingon the health-care organization, the specialty systems with these tools may bebought from the same vendor or from multiple different vendors; this has a bear-ing on how difficult it will be to integrate patient information across systems orinto one central data repository. Integration of clinical and financial informationis becoming increasingly important in today's health-care environment because of regulatory quality and financial integration. Another benefit of elec-tronic records is that multiple clinicians are able simultaneously to access thepatient's electronic chart, and this eliminates the risk of loss that often resultsfrom tracking paper documentation. Technical Aspects of Informatics As a nurse leader and manager or an informatics nurse, it is extremely beneficialto have some technical level of understanding of an information system. The ITpersonnel who maintain the system and the clinical specialists who actually usethe systems may have entirely different educational backgrounds and may thinkand communicate differently. Understanding these differences will help to improvecommunication between these groups, and that, in turn, promotes safe and qualitypatient care.198 PART II PROMOTION OF PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY CARE 3021_Ch09_195-210 14/01/17 3:53 PM Page 198Network A network is the fundamental framework of an information system that allows elec- tronic devices to transfer information to each other. The Internet is the most com- mon example of a public network. Most health-care organizations have their ownnetworks within the confines of their system, called intranets (Hebda & Czar, 2009).With the advancement of mobile computing in the health-care industry, most organizations also offer access to their network through wireless technology. Thisaccess requires a separate network using wireless antennas for coverage. Data Data comprise a collection of information, facts, or numbers. Nurses collect and manage data constantly when caring for patients. Nurse leaders and managersgather, manage, analyze, and interpret data to ensure effective operation of the unitas well as safe and effective delivery of nursing care. Database The central place that stores data is referred to as a database . Databases provide a key location for data to be stored and retrieved for analysis when needed. This iswhere the importance of discrete data, discussed in more detail later in this chapter,comes into play because these data can be stored in the same place within the data-base and easily compared. (For example, when a nurse documents \"yes\" as a dis-crete response to the question \"Does the patient have a history of falls in the last 6 months?\" it is much easier to find and compare this value in the database.) A clin-ical data repository is a database in which data from all information systems withinan organization is kept and controlled (Hebda & Czar, 2009). Organizations mayextract information from the database and use it to create new knowledge, establishbest practice, or predict outcomes; this extraction is a form of data mining, dis-cussed next (Connolly & Begg, 2005; Sewell, 2016). Data Mining EHRs contain an enormous amount of data. To collect data from these records man-ually is an unrealistic undertaking. Data mining is the process of extracting specific data or knowledge that was previously unknown (Sewell, 2016). This process can be usedto understand patients' symptoms, predict diseases, and identify possible interven-tions (Sewell, 2016). All nurses should have a basic understanding of data mining.Nurse leaders and managers use data mining to extract, predict, evaluate, and applyknowledge to develop best practices in patient care, delivery, staffing and scheduling,error reporting, incident reporting, budgeting, and forecasting and planning. Interfaces The health-care setting is brimming with technological devices that are capable ofgathering and/or analyzing electronic data. Unfortunately, these devices are notChapter 9 Information Technology for Safe and Quality Patient Care 199 3021_Ch09_195-210 14/01/17 3:53 PM Page 199all designed and built by the same manufacturer or with the same purpose in mind, so they often do not communicate with other devices or systems. Interfaces are used to match data points from one system to the other so that this information can becommunicated among systems or sent to a main information system for collectiveuse and analysis. These interfaces can send information as it is gathered (real-timeprocessing) or can function with a delay (batch processing) to save system resources(Hebda & Czar, 2009). Interfaces can also allow devices to communicate directlywith an information system, thereby reducing the time nurses spend manually en-tering the information as well as eliminating data entry errors. For example, ahealth-care organization can use a device to gather vital sign data and transmit itthrough an interface into a patient's medical record. Decision Support Systems With the use of an information system, a health-care organization may choose touse tools called decision support systems , which provide warnings or other decision support methods to help health-care professionals become more aware of certainclinical information (i.e., infection precaution) or use evidence-based practices(Hebda & Czar, 2009). Rules and Alerts Health-care organizations may also use rules and alerts to provide decision sup-port. Rules require an action within the system to trigger or \"fire\" them, such as apatient's being admitted with certain criteria, a laboratory result, or informationdocumented by a health-care professional. For example, during influenza seasonan organization may have a rule that is triggered by all patients admitted with aninpatient status from October through April that reminds the health-care providerto perform influenza screening. A more obtrusive decision support tool is an alert. An alert could be straightfor- ward, such as a warning that a patient has tested positive for a resistant organism(e.g., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA]) and to implement precau- tions per institutional policy. Alerts could also be used to require the nurse to ac-knowledge the warning or select a reason for override (if clinically appropriate).For example, health-care providers may receive an alert when ordering a medica-tion that is contraindicated for the patient. They may acknowledge the warningand remove the order, or they may override it for a valid reason. The risk with alert-ing is that it can lead to \"alert fatigue\" among clinicians, in which they becomeused to the warnings and start to ignore them, often not realizing what the warn-ings said. Rules and alerts should be used on a limited basis and focus on the mostcrucial patient care issues. Standardized Languages Standardized languages are used in information systems to enable understanding among disciplines and across information systems. This common language allowsfor streamlined sharing of information because the same terms are used by everyone200 PART II PROMOTION OF PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY CARE 3021_Ch09_195-210 14/01/17 3:53 PM Page 200to describe the same condition. Standardized language is important for effective data mining and is required for nursing documentation in EHRs (ANA, 2008). Usingstandardized language ensures that medical information as well as nursing actionsand outcomes are included in EHRs and provide data that may need to be analyzed.Health Level Seven International is an American National Standards Institute-accredited nonprofit organization that provides a common platform for informationsystems or devices to exchange information among other systems or devices (HealthLevel Seven International, 2007-2016). HOW INFORMATICS CONTRIBUTES TO PATIENT SAFETY Patient safety is a priority in health care. The IOM published multiple reports onquality and patient safety that affect patients in this country, including the follow-ing: To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System (Kohn, Corrigan, & Donaldson, 2000); Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century (IOM, 2001); Health Professions Education: A Bridge to Quality (Greiner & Knebel, 2003). The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health (IOM, 2011); and Health IT and Patient Safety: Building Safer Systems for Better Care (IOM, 2012). These reports reflect the important safety and quality issues in our health-care sys- tem. The use of evidence-based practice cues within the information system, decisionsupport (rules and alerts), and reminders or tasks that decrease memory-based careall contribute to improved patient outcomes. All nurses are called to assume more ofa leadership role in the integration of informatics in health care (IOM, 2011, 2012). All nurses must be able to locate pertinent information and best practices to be able to provide safe and effective nursing care (Wahoush & Banfield, 2014). Further,nurses must have specific informatics competencies to be able to assist in designinguser-friendly technologies that ensure patient safety and improve care delivery andpatient outcomes (Sewell, 2016). Nurse leaders and managers must be active in theassimilation of information systems and evaluate and revise patient care processesand systems to facilitate safe and effective patient care (AONE, 2011).

Information literacy during entry to practice: Information-seeking behaviors in student nurses and recent nurse graduates.Nurse Education Today, 34 (2014), 208-213. Aim The aim of this study was to describe information-seeking behaviors of studentnurses and registered nurses (RNs) within their clinical settings. Methods This pilot study used a two-phase descriptive cross-sectional design. Participantsincluded senior nursing students, new graduate RNs, and nurse leaders and library3021_Ch09_195-210 14/01/17 3:53 PM Page 201LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY IMPACTS ON INFORMATICS Federal and state governments as well as independent institutions are establishing standards and accreditation guidelines to encourage further implementation ofinformation systems within the health-care setting.202 PART II PROMOTION OF PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY CARE EXPLORING THE EVIDENCE 9-1\u2014cont'd staff. Senior nursing students and new graduate RNs were surveyed to identify the information sources and resources they used in clinical practice. Qualitative interviews were conducted with nurse leaders and library staff to understand theextent of resources available for nurses and how new RNs learned about availableresources. In phase I, 62 undergraduate senior nursing students completed the Nurses Informative Sources Survey. In phase II, 18 new graduate RNs completed theNurses Informative Sources Survey, and six nurse leaders and library staff mem-bers were interviewed. Senior nursing students and new graduate RNs responseswere grouped into three categories of information sources: electronic, print, andinterpersonal. Key Findings Senior nursing students and new graduate RNs reported accessing at least one ex-ample from each category for information to inform their practice. Both groups re-ported that electronic sources of information were mostly used. Nursing studentsreported using print resources more than interpersonal resources, whereas newgraduate RNs reported using interpersonal resources more than print resources. In all, 11% of new graduate RNs reported using personal handheld devices forclinical information, whereas no nursing students used such devices. Both groupsindicated they had limited access to hospital library resources. All nurse leaders and library staff indicated that their organization provided orientation and mentoring for new staff. Library staff reported that they welcomeopportunities to assist new RN staff better access information. However, they also reported that when hospitals encountered financial challenges, services not directly linked to patient care may be reduced. In one example, the library was moved outside of the hospital, thus making it difficult for staff to use the resources. Implications for Nurse Leaders and Managers The findings of this pilot study support that senior nursing students and new grad-uate RNs use various information sources to inform their practice, including per-sonal information devices. Nurse leaders and managers must be aware of currentpractices and consider needed policies and practice guidelines to ensure informa-tion security. In addition, nurse leaders and managers should be advocates for in-formation access by nurses through new library services that provide on-demandinformation in the clinical setting.3021_Ch09_195-210 14/01/17 3:53 PM Page 202Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), dis- cussed in depth in Chapter 4, introduced three rules to protect health information:privacy, security, and breach notification. The HIPAA Privacy Rule was designedto safeguard an individual's health information. The HIPAA Security Rule estab-lished a set of national standards to protect electronic health information. Finally,the Breach Notification Rule requires all health-care organizations to report anydata breaches (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, n.d.). The electronicage introduced a means to minimize patient data loss, but it also introduced a plat-form for making patient information easier to copy and transfer. Health-care or-ganizations need to be vigilant with enforcing data protection policies and/or usesoftware such as data encryption to minimize data breaches. American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) helped to advancethe field of informatics. The health-care component of this bill is known as the HealthInformation Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH Act. Therequirements include metrics to improve patient care, quality, and public health. The ARRA initially provides incentives when metrics are met by both physician practices and hospitals to move toward electronic documentation and processes toimprove patient care. In time, penalties will be assessed if these standards are notachieved. The standards for eligible hospitals and eligible providers are similar. Regulatory Requirements The Joint Commission, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), andthe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services are all regulatory bodies that havestandards that must be met. The EHR assists in meeting these requirements. Data arecollected from the EHR to improve health-care and patient outcomes. The number andtopics of required data vary from year to year as regulatory requirements are updated.There are also many national quality organizations that provide recommendations fororganizations, including Leap Frog, IOM, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality,National Quality Forum, and Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (Newbold, 2013) Many regulatory requirements also have financial implications. One of these is the Meaningful Use program , part of CMS Quality Incentive Programs. Meaningful Use is a CMS program that requires use of the electronic record to improve patient care.The purpose of this program was to move health care to electronic records. Thisprogram ensures that certain required components will be available, thus providing\"meaningful use of the EHR.\" Meaningful Use consists of three stages (CMS, 2016): Stage 1: Data capture and sharing Stage 2: Advanced clinical processesStage 3: Improved outcomes Reporting must be done directly from a certified EHR and must be from discrete data elements.Chapter 9 Information Technology for Safe and Quality Patient Care 203 3021_Ch09_195-210 14/01/17 3:53 PM Page 203INFORMATICS DEPARTMENTS Nurse leaders and managers will work with many types of IT professionals. Table 9-2 outlines some of the roles and responsibilities of this group. USE OF DATA IN INFORMATICS Maintaining a high level of data quality is essential in informatics. Data qualitymust be reliable and effective. Standardizing data can help to provide a higher levelof data quality. Data quality should be kept in mind during design of electronicrecords so that discrete data elements are available. Discrete data elements aremuch easier to pull from the system's data repository than are narrative entry (freetext) data entry elements. These discrete data elements may be used for researchor for meeting regulatory requirements. Data Set A data set is simply a standardized group of data. There are multiple types of data sets, which may be used for billing, research, or other data uses. Data sets are usedto provide a standard set of data on a patient, as well as standard definitions of dataelements. Examples of data sets include the UB-04, which is standard data set re-quired for institutional billing by federal and state governments, and the CMS-1500,which is a similar data set required for noninstitutional health-care settings. Thedata from both of these data sets is used by the CMS for health-care reimbursement,clinical, and population trends (Wager, Lee, & Glaser, 2013). There are several otherstandard data set types for specific settings or data use. Coding Coding is the process of taking the data in a patient's file and applying an industry- standard medical code to the data. Two basic types of coding systems are used in204 PART II PROMOTION OF PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY CARE Table 9-2 Roles and Responsibilities of Informatics Departments IT, information technology.

The ICD-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is the system currently used for coding diagnoses in the United States. CPT is the coding system for procedures. CPT cod-ing manuals are published by the American Medical Association every year. Theyare used widely in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Both of these coding systems are used to provide information for billing, research, and other data purposes. Data Security Data security is a critical aspect in a health-care environment. Patient data can be lost,changed, or held hostage by viruses or malware attacks. There are several tools andmethods used by health-care organizations to maintain data security. The most basiclevel of security includes the use of unique usernames and passwords, biometricidentification, and security token identification. Unique usernames and passwordsallow the system to collect an audit trail of who has accessed the system, when theydid, and often which areas of the information system they accessed. Some systemsare also starting to use biometric identification, such as fingerprint or retina verifica-tion, or devices that provide a randomly generated code for signature (security tokenidentification). Data that are transmitted can be encrypted, and firewalls can be in place to pre- vent unauthorized access. Data encryption is a tool used to protect information thatis transferred electronically (e-mail) or physically (laptop computer). This processtransforms the data into an unreadable form by using mathematical formulas(Hebda & Czar, 2009). A firewall is a mix of hardware and software that aims toprevent unauthorized access to a health-care organization's system (Hebda & Czar,2009). This added security can also create difficulties for internal systems. A firewallmust be taken into account when setting up an interface connection. Nurse leaders and managers are critical to maintaining successful data security. They must take an active role in protecting a health-care organization's informationassets and patient information. Nurse leaders and managers must enforce a culturethat promotes and respects patient information security. They should be involvedin the development and enforcement of organizational security policies that reflectrules and regulations and are designed to reduce or alleviate security risks. In ad-dition, nurse leaders must ensure ongoing education for all staff related to infor-mation security and HIPAA. INFORMATION SYSTEMS USED IN HEALTH CARE All nurses must have an understanding of some basics of information systems. Infor-mation systems are usually composed of several different applications that work together to provide a comprehensive record. An application is a computer program that performs a certain function or activity. Switching between applications can be eitherseamless or very apparent (e.g., selecting another application may require anotherlogin or another window to open). The following subsections describe some of themain information systems and applications used in a health-care information system.Chapter 9 Information Technology for Safe and Quality Patient Care 205 3021_Ch09_195-210 14/01/17 3:53 PM Page 205Electronic Medication Administration Record A common mantra in nursing school is \"if it was not documented, it was not done.\" Documentation is the record of all assessments, treatments, and evaluations. Ap-plications supporting documentation need to be dependable and support the clin-ician's workflow. The application that supports documentation of medications isthe electronic medication administration record (eMAR). The eMAR has multiple features that enhance patient care. It provides a list of medication orders and when they aredue to be administered. Once the medication is administered, it also provides aplace to document medication administration. After medication administration isdocumented, the eMAR also provides historical information regarding medicationsthat have been administered. Computerized Provider Order Entry An important application within an electronic record is the computerized provider order entry (CPOE). This application allows providers within a health-care organization to enter orders directly into a patient's record, thus omitting any transcription errors. It also allows integration of decision support systems (e.g., allergy alerting)and helps standardize patient care by encouraging groups of evidence-based orders(order sets). CPOE also has the potential to improve workflow among ancillaryservices by allowing them to receive notice of an order (e.g., from radiology) im-mediately, rather than depending on someone to monitor paper orders and relaythe order either by fax or pneumatic tube system. Barcode Medication Administration Barcode medication administration is the process in which clinicians use a barcode reader to verify a patient's identity and drug information immediately before giv-ing medication to a patient. This system requires both the patient identifier (wristband) and drug packaging to have a barcode. Barcode medication administrationis one of the best patient safety tools at the point of care (patient bedside). Patient Portals Many vendors of EMR systems have developed Web-based platforms for patientsto access their health information online called patient portals. Patient portalsmay allow the patient to e-mail their provider, request refills, and view informa-tion such as immunizations, medications, and laboratory results (HealthIT.gov,2015). Telehealth Telehealth is a specialty in health care in which electronic devices (e.g., comput-ers) and telecommunication technology are used to serve education and healthcare to clinicians and patients (Hebda & Czar, 2009). An example of Telehealth iswound assessment with care done remotely by supplying a health-care providerwith images or video of the wound.206 PART II PROMOTION OF PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY CARE 3021_Ch09_195-210 14/01/17 3:53 PM Page 206Online Health Information The number of consumers accessing health information online is growing. It is not unusual for patients to arrive for an appointment with their health-care providerequipped with information and questions based on suspect online information.This creates a need to ensure that health-care websites provide credible information.The ability to publish anything on the Internet results in information that may ormay not be reliable and credible. Nurses are in the ideal position to assist patientsand families in evaluating health information available online and guiding themto trusted websites (Sewell, 2016). IMPLEMENTATION OF AN INFORMATICS PROJECT Identifying potential issues in advance of implementation of the project is impor-tant. Superusers can help in this process. Superusers are generally representatives from the local nursing locations who receive enhanced training to help with implementation success and stability over the life of the system. They understandthe new application and can help the staff members in the area integrate the newsystem or application into the future state workflow. Once implementation begins, it is important to remember the following: Productivity will decrease initially while staff members are learning and becomingcomfortable with the change. People learn at different rates and in different ways. Motivation to change comes from a positive assessment of the upcoming change. Communication is the key to successful change management. The environment should be one that does not expect perfection. This approachallows staff to learn and become use to the new system. Addressing change management is essential for any informatics projects, such as the successful transition to a new EHR. Conversion Strategy and Conversion Planning Conversion is that point in time when you switch from one system to another orturn on a new application. Conversion planning needs to take place to ensure asmooth transition. The following questions should be asked: Who is involved? Where will the system be implemented? Chapter 9 Information Technology for Safe and Quality Patient Care 207 LEARNING ACTIVITY 9-1 Evaluating an Online Web Site Use an online evaluation checklist and evaluate two health Web sites: 1. Score both Web sites and discuss how they compare. 2. Describe the strengths and weaknesses of each Web site. Helpful online evaluation tools are available at https://nnlm.gov/outreach/ consumer/evalsite.html. 3021_Ch09_195-210 14/01/17 3:53 PM Page 207When (time and date) will the conversion take place? Is it better to do the conversion at shift change or midshift? How will chart continuity be maintained? Will any information be backloaded into the new system? What activities need to be included, and who will do them? All of these items must be taken into account during the conversion. There should always be a contingency plan in case the change needs to be backed out (reversed). Implementation Support Model Implementation support for conversion to a new electronic system or applicationrequires technical, vendor, education, and support resources. Most sites set up acommand center that has these resources available onsite 24 hours day, 7 days aweek for a designated period of time. In addition to the command center, supportresources are available in the unit. Analysts and educators are placed in the unitsto assist with support as well as superusers. Organizations also often have vendoror consultant assistance with support, especially for \"big bang\" (simultaneous con-version from old to new system) implementations. Superusers play an essential role in implementation support. Different models are used at different organizations. One common model is to have three levels ofsuperuser: expert, shift, and unit. The expert user is the representative who assistedwith design. Shift experts on each shift help with the actual implementation. Theshift expert has both clinical knowledge and supplemental computer training thatis helpful as staff members transition to the new system. The role of the unit leaderis to solve management issues that arise during the implementation. Maintenance The system maintenance phase begins after the implementation and close of theproject. Many of the project team members move on to other activities, but someteam members continue to support the application and make enhancements to thesystem throughout the rest of the system life cycle. Each organization has a philos-ophy regarding the degree of software and coding enhancements that will be madeduring the maintenance phase. Some sites make changes only for additional regu-latory requirements, whereas other sites may do a high level of customization duringthe maintenance phase. All sites must perform upgrades to keep the code for theapplication up to date so that the vendor will continue to support the application. System Downtime Downtime procedures need to be developed and communicated before implemen-tation. Staff members must know how they will obtain information when the sys-tem is down. There may be different levels of downtime that will determine whatcan be accessed in the system. There may be an entire network downtime, whichmay mean that no information is accessible. There may also be partial downtimes,208 PART II PROMOTION OF PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY CARE 3021_Ch09_195-210 14/01/17 3:53 PM Page 208which may affect certain parts of the system that will determine what information is accessible. Downtimes may also be planned or unplanned. Planned downtimes occur when the system is taken down to make some specific changes such as an upgrade or other enhancements to the system. Planning andcommunication are done in advance to lessen the effects of the downtime. Backupsystems are put into place to provide access to important patient data. The backupsystems may be electronic or paper. Unplanned downtimes present additional challenges. These situations do not allow the same preparation as planned downtimes. There needs to be a plan forthese situations. Again, the backup plan may be another electronic system or paper.Another challenge during unplanned downtimes is communication to end usersas the downtime is taking place. These communication avenues must be establishedbefore the downtime. The IT department has formal processes for determiningwhen a downtime has occurred, when downtime processes should start, and whatthose processes are. SUMMARY Nursing informatics is crucial to improving patient safety and patient outcomes.Its importance can be seen in administrative and clinical arenas. Information sys-tems comprise a complex arrangement of hardware and software that, once suc-cessfully put in place, provide the foundation for an enhanced way of providingpatient care. Electronic records provide data necessary to make clinical decisions,do research, and support regulatory requirements. The field of informatics has expanded the potential roles for nurses. Roles for nurses in informatics span from an entry-level position (analyst or educator) toupper-level management. Nursing leaders and managers may be called on to workwith a variety of these technical specialists. Nursing participation is required in allof the phases of an informatics project. All nurses at all levels must have basic informatics skills to manage the large amount of data involved in safe and quality patient care. Nurses must be \"computerfluent, information literate, and informatics knowledgeable\" (Sewell, 2016, p. 17).Nurse leaders and managers have a responsibility to ensure that adequate techno-logical resources are available to staff to provide safe and quality nursing care.

It is estimated that 1.13 million registered nurses (RNs) will be needed by 2022 to fill new jobs and replace retiring nurses (American Nurses Association[ANA], 2014). Several reasons for the ongoing nursing shortage are nurse job dis-satisfaction, unhealthy work environments, lack of recognition for accomplish-ments, and unclear role expectations (Bryant-Hampton, Walton, Carroll, & Strickler,2010; Masters, 2014; Riley, Rolband, James, & Norton, 2009). The continuing nursingshortage, high turnover in nursing, complex health-care systems, increasing patientacuity, and fiscal constraints may influence nurse leaders and managers who areeager to fill nursing positions to make quick and sometimes hasty hiring decisions.However, nurse leaders and managers have a responsibility to hire safe, competentnurses with high integrity (Hader, 2005). Recruiting, developing, and retainingquality staff must be a priority for all nurse leaders and managers. In addition, ad-dressing areas of dissatisfaction to retain experienced nurses is critical to providethe level of complex care needed today. To retain nurses, nurse leaders and man-agers must establish a healthy work environment that creates joy and meaning atwork, creates synergy, and fosters workforce sustainability (American Associationof Critical-Care Nurses, 2005; Lucian Leape Institute, 2013). In this chapter, the nurse leader and manager's role in creating a sustainable workforce is covered, from the recruiting stage through retaining quality nurses.In addition, management of staff is discussed, including the performance reviewprocess and corrective action. Knowledge, skills, and attitudes related to the following core competency are included in this chapter: teamwork and collaboration. CREATING A SUSTAINABLE WORKFORCE It is estimated that more than 1 million RNs will reach retirement age between 2025and 2030 (Health Resources and Service Administration [HRSA] Bureau of HealthProfessions, 2013). In 2000, many RNs were 41 to 45 years old. Those nurses are nowreaching retirement age, yet the smallest numbers of RNs today are 35 to 45 years old,and there has been only a marginal increase in the number of RNs less than 35 yearsold (HRSA Bureau of Health Professions, 2013). To maintain a higher percentage ofexperienced nurses at the bedside, nurse leaders and managers must identify methodsto increase nurse satisfaction and explore creative strategies to accommodate oldernurses. Key elements of the nurse leader and manager's role related to sustaining aquality nursing workforce are displayed in Box 10-1. Nurse leaders and managers alsoneed to bring younger nurses into the workforce to prepare for the retirement of oldernurses. To achieve the goal of creating a sustainable workforce, nurse managers andleaders must be able to recruit, interview, orient, and retain quality nurses of all ages. Recruiting The cost of recruiting and orienting new nurses requires nurse leaders and managersto make hiring decisions carefully and to seek and select the best person for the rightChapter 10 Creating and Managing a Sustainable Workforce 213 3021_Ch10_211-228 16/01/17 10:46 AM Page 213position. Based on the complexity of health care and high acuity of patients, some health-care organizations prefer to hire experienced nurses and/or nurses with baccalaureate degrees or advanced education. However, nurse leaders and man-agers should consider recruiting and hiring a balance of new nurse graduates andexperienced nurses, given the increasing demand for health care, aging babyboomers, and upcoming nurse retirements (McMenamin, 2014). Nurse leaders andmanagers must be committed to recruiting and hiring the brightest and the best. Byemploying new nurse graduates and providing adequate transition-to-practice(TTP) programs, nurse leaders and managers can develop and retain increasinglyexperienced nurses in anticipation of the retirement of aging nurses\u2014essentially,\"growing their own\" experienced nursing workforce (McMenamin, 2014). Attractingtalented nurses requires providing continuing education, up-to-date-technology,professional development, and opportunities for advancement (Roussel, 2013). Interviewing Once a quality applicant is identified, the nurse leader and manager should preparefor interviews by reviewing the applicant's information, resume, and letters of reference and by making notes of key questions to ask during the interview. Theinterview should be scheduled when the nurse leader and manager is available tomeet for an adequate amount of time and without interruption; in addition, it isimportant to ensure that there is ample time for the applicant to ask questions.Some organizations may use a team approach to interviews in which applicantsare also interviewed by a panel of nurses and other staff members. Involving staffcan be an effective approach and reduce bias on the part of the nurse leader andmanager. The focus of the interviews should be on the roles and responsibilitiesoutlined in the position description. A position description reflects current practice standards and provides clear, written expectations about the roles and responsibil-ities of the position. It should also include the name of the person to whom the em-ployee reports. Nurse leaders and managers must treat all applicants equally andas professionals, as well as keeping in mind that applicants may have other posi-tions they are considering. During the interview, the nurse leader and manager must avoid asking ques- tions that are considered inappropriate.

Such information can be obtained after the employee is hired. Some of the laws discussed in Chapter 4 arerelevant during the interview, including the Civil Rights Act, the Age Discrimi-nation in Employment Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Table 10-1provides examples of questions that are illegal to ask and alternative questionsto ask instead. When the nurse leader and manager is interviewing several applicants for the same position, it is important to ask all applicants the samequestions. The interview is a two-way process. While the nurse leader and manager is interviewing applicants to determine whether they are qualified to fill a specificposition, applicants should be assessing the interaction and gathering as much information as possible to be able to make an informed decision to accept or declinean offer. A wise applicant researches the organization before the interview. Review-ing the mission, vision, and philosophy of the organization can help nurses deter-mine whether the organization's values and beliefs are congruent with theirindividual beliefs.

When the cost of recruiting and orienting newstaff is calculated, the estimated average cost of turnover is equivalent to a nurse'sannual salary (Halfer, 2007). In addition, approximately 25% of new graduatenurses will leave their position within the first year (National Council of StateBoards of Nursing [NCSBN], 2015). To retain new graduate nurses, orientation pro-grams need to bridge the gap between the student nurse clinical setting and thereal-world clinical setting. Programs for new nurses that focus on effective TTP andthat include both competency development and role transition have been shownto improve retention rates (Halfer, 2007; Spector et al., 2015). The NCSBN (2015) explored the issue of educating and retaining new nurse graduates since 2005 and found that the inability of new nurse graduates to tran-sition into clinical practice has and will continue to have great consequences forthe nursing profession and patient outcomes. In collaboration with more than35 nursing organizations, the NCSBN worked to develop an evidence-based TTPmodel to assist new nurses as they transition from the classroom to the clinicalsetting (NCSBN, 2015); more information about the TTP model is available onthe NCSBN Web site at www.ncsbn.org/transition-to-practice.htm. StructuredTTP programs that are at least 6 months long and include core competencies,clinical reasoning, regular feedback on progress, self-reflection, and specialtyknowledge in an area of practice improve the quality and safety practice of newgraduate nurses, increase job satisfaction, decrease work stress, and decreaseturnover (Spector et al., 2015). When setting up orientation for new nurses as well as seasoned nurses, the nurse leader and manager must consider the characteristics of the new staff members andselect an appropriate preceptor. The novice-to-expert model can assist with makingsuccessful preceptor assignments (Benner, 1984). Most new graduate nurses exhibitcharacteristics of the novice and advanced beginner stage, and new nurse graduatesdemonstrate marginally acceptable performance (NCSBN, 2011). In many cases, newnurse graduates use context-free rules to guide their actions or may begin to formulatesome guidelines for their actions. New nurse graduates have not developed enoughinsight to discern which tasks are relevant in real-world situations (NCSBN, 2011). The appropriate preceptor is critical to successful on-boarding of new nurses. Novices and advanced beginners do not have past experiences to base decisionson, so their approach to patient care is slow and methodical; they are very focusedon being safe and efficient (Benner, 1984). In addition, the new generation ofnurses needs regular verbal and written feedback to build confidence and self-esteem. The best preceptor for the new nurse graduate may be a nurse who is atthe competent stage (i.e., has about 3 years of experience and is able to demon-strate effective organizational, time management, and planning abilities). Com-petent nurses can differentiate important tasks from less important aspects ofcare. In addition, their time as a new nurse graduate is recent enough that theycan approach the preceptorship with empathy. A less than ideal preceptor is anexpert and proficient nurse because nurses at this stage make rapid decisionsbased on previous experiences, have difficulty putting what they know into216 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS 3021_Ch10_211-228 16/01/17 10:46 AM Page 216words for the new nurse to understand, and may have less patience for the on- going feedback the new nurse graduate requires (Benner, 1984). On its Web site,the NCSBN provides a chart to assist nurse leaders and managers in assigningpreceptors to new nurses (ncsbn.org/Preceptor-NovicetoExpertchar.pdf). Retaining Examining strategies to retain experienced nurses is critical in finding a solutionto the long-term nursing shortage. Inadequate staffing leads to nurse dissatisfac-tion, burnout, and turnover, all of which jeopardizes the quality of patient care.High turnover can have negative consequences on patient safety, nurse satisfaction,and the health-care organization overall as a result of low staff morale, insufficientChapter 10 Creating and Managing a Sustainable Workforce 217 EXPLORING THE EVIDENCE 10-1 Spector, N., Blegen, M. A., Silvestre, J., Barnsteiner, J., Lynn, M. R., Ulrich, B., Fogg, L., & Alexander, M. (2015). Transition to practice study in hospital settings. Journal of Nursing Regulation, 5(4), 24-38. Aim There were three aims to this study: 1. To conduct a randomized, controlled multisite study examining quality and safety, stress, competence, job satisfaction, and retention in new graduate nurses 2. To compare outcomes with a control group of hospitals that had preexisting transition to practice programs 3. To obtain diverse samples that included rural, suburban, and urban hospitals of all sizes Methods A randomized longitudinal multisite design was used to examine the effects of the NCSBN TTP program and other similar programs for new graduates. The researchers recruited 1,088 new RNs from 94 hospitals between July 1, 2011, andSeptember 30, 2011, to participate. Key Findings This study supports that a standardized TTP program improves safety and qual-ity outcomes. The programs in place for at least 2 years had the best outcomesover time. New nurses in hospitals with limited TTP programs had more med-ical errors, felt less competent, experienced more stress, reported less job satisfac-tion, and had twice the turnover rate than did new nurses in hospitals with TTPprograms. Implications for Nurse Leaders and Managers This study provides significant evidence for nurse leaders and managers to support standardized TTP programs for new nurses. 3021_Ch10_211-228 16/01/17 10:46 AM Page 217monitoring of patients, increased errors, poor-quality care, increased patient costs, and decrease in hospital profitability (American Association of Critical-CareNurses, 2016; Page, 2004). Moreover, high turnover threatens the overall experiencelevel of the nursing staff, which, in turn, compromises patient safety (Page, 2004).The number one strategy to retain nurses is by creating and sustaining a healthywork environment. Accomplishing this requires strong nursing leadership at alllevels of the health-care organization, but especially at the unit level, where front-line nurses and nurse leaders and managers work and where patient care is deliv-ered (Sherman & Pross, 2010). Nurse leaders and managers must create a visionfor a healthy work environment and authentically live it (American Association ofCritical-Care Nurses, 2005). A healthy work environment is one in which nurses feel safe from physiological and psychological harm and can find meaning and joy in their work. Nurse leadersand managers are responsible for creating the cultural norms and environment thatresult in workforce safety, meaning, and joy (Lucian Leape Institute, 2013). A workenvironment can be considered healthy and as one that brings meaning and joy tothe worker's life when each nurse is able to answer \"yes\" every day to the followingquestions (Lucian Leape Institute, 2013, p. 15): 1.Am I treated with dignity and respect by everyone? 2.Do I have what I need so I can make a contribution that gives meaning to my life? 3.Am I recognized and thanked for what I do? Meaningful recognition is important in retaining experienced nurses. \"Nurses must be recognized and must recognize others for the value each brings to the work of the organization\" (American Association of Critical-Care Nurses, 2016, p. 29).Nurses who are not recognized often feel invisible, undervalued, and disrespected,feelings that eventually can sap their motivation (American Association of Critical-Care Nurses, 2016). Nurse leaders and managers have an ethical responsibility to\"establish, maintain, and promote conditions of employment that enable nurses topractice according to accepted standards\" (ANA, 2015a, p. 28). Nurse leaders andmanagers can provide recognition, mentoring, coaching, and career or professionaldevelopment opportunities to enhance the nursing workforce. Retaining experi-enced nurses is critical to providing safe and quality care, and a healthy work envi-ronment is paramount to retaining experienced nurses. Healthy work environmentsare discussed further in Chapter 13. MANAGING THE WORKFORCE Daily and ongoing management of the workforce includes many challenges, in-cluding managing generational differences, coaching team members, appraisingperformance, and using corrective action. Managing Generational Differences On any nursing unit, as many as four different generations of nurses may be work-ing side by side. Each generation has its own unique characteristics, work ethic, and218 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS 3021_Ch10_211-228 16/01/17 10:46 AM Page 218expectations of the workplace (Murray, 2013). (The characteristics of each generation are discussed in Chapter 15.) Nurse leaders and managers must identify strategiesto create cohesive partnerships among the different generations to ensure safe andquality nursing care and create a healthy work environment. Stereotypes and judg-mental attitudes about each generation can undermine the nursing team. For exam-ple, often there is the perception that older nurses do not like younger nurses; onthe other end of the spectrum, there is sometimes the assumption by the new gen-eration of nurses that older generations of nurses are old-fashioned and technolog-ically challenged. When generations collide in the workplace, patient care can becompromised. In addition, nurse satisfaction can be affected, resulting in miscom-munication, interpersonal tension, decreased productivity, increased absenteeism,and increased turnover. Nurse leaders and managers must foster a supportive andcollegial environment that brings the various generations together to achieve theircommon goals. Acknowledging what each generation brings to the table and learn-ing from the various generations can decrease tension and enhance personal andprofessional growth, leading to mutual respect (Murray, 2013; Weston, 2006). Improved health and technological advances are allowing older nurses to work longer, and these expert nurses are needed for their skills and experiences to fillmany essential positions (American Organization of Nurse Executives [AONE],2010). In fact, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2013-2014),more than one-third of RNs are more than 50 years old. Many older nurses arehealthy and want to work beyond retirement years. In fact, a new view of aging isbeing recognized today as the average life expectancy increases and the quality oflife in the final decades improves; in fact, a new middle period of life from age 50to 70 years old is emerging, called the third age (Bower & Sadler, 2009). This new paradigm of successful aging is challenging the view of what is \"old\"\u2014and manysay \"60 is the new 40\" (Bower & Sadler, 2009). Third-age nurses are needed today to combat the current and future nursing short- age. They know the health-care system and provide a valuable resource because oftheir experience, knowledge, wisdom, and competence (AONE, 2010; Bower &Sadler, 2009). Nurse leaders and managers have \"a vested interest in ensuring thatqualified and talented nurses are not lost to traditional retirement, but instead redi-rected to other rewarding jobs and careers in nursing\" (Bower & Sadler, 2009, p. 20).They must consider strategies to retain and develop older nurses for new and emerg-ing roles. This approach may involve exploring environmental modifications to meetthe needs of older nurses and prevent injuries because loss of strength and agilitymay affect older nurses' ability to turn, lift, and transfer patients, as well as toleratethe overall physical demands of the job (Page, 2004). To leverage generational differences, nurse managers and leaders can use the following strategies to make the workplace more generationally comfortable(Murray, 2013): Accommodate differences by recognizing the strengths of each generation, anduse those strengths to build a sustainable workforce. Be flexible when giving options in the workplace, and consider alternate sched-uling options. Seek input from staff on recruitment, retention, and staffing mattersthat could decrease turnover and increase job satisfaction.Chapter 10 Creating and Managing a Sustainable Workforce 219 3021_Ch10_211-228 16/01/17 10:46 AM Page 219Use a sophisticated management style, and modify management approaches to address the differences and similarities of each generation. Keeping staff in-formed, providing the big picture, and using rewards, recognition, and feedbackare management strategies that appeal to all generations. Respect competence and initiative, and value the talents and work ethics of eachgeneration, even though they differ. For example, use the expertise and experi-ence of older and seasoned nurses to help develop policies and procedures andset up programs to assist new nurses. Provide younger nurses with opportunitiesto solve problems and contribute to teamwork on their own terms. Nurses ofyounger generations tend to be collaborators and prefer frequent feedback, soprovide them with seasoned mentors who will coach them as they launch theirnursing career. Coaching Staff Members Coaching is the art of guiding another individual toward fulfilling his or her future; to assist a person in achieving his or her goals, a coach helps him or her developand prioritize viable solutions and then act on them (Narayanasamy & Penney,2014; Porter-O'Grady & Malloch, 2013). Coaching is a strategy used by nurse lead-ers and managers to motivate and assist their staff members to improve theirwork performance. Part of coaching includes observing employee performanceand providing ongoing feedback and constant encouragement. Staff membersneed to feel supported by the nurse leader and manager to be successful and excelin their roles (Roussel, 2013). Effective coaching is transformative because it re-sults in significant changes in an individual that motivate him or her to findachievement, fulfillment, and joy in the workplace (Narayanasamy & Penney,2014). An effective coach assists nurses in recognizing opportunities for learningand development. Nurse leaders and managers can use coaching when team building, in managing change, for professional development, and in career planning. The coaching rela-tionship must be built on respect and trust. Nurses being coached must feel safeand secure, valued, and validated by the coach (Narayanasamy & Penney, 2014).To be effective coaches, nurse leaders and managers must become self-aware. Qual-ities of an effective coach are listed in Box 10-2. Coaching is beneficial to sustainingthe workforce because it increases productivity, patient safety, quality of nursingcare, and nurses' confidence and professionalism. 220 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS BOX 10-2BOX 10-2 Characteristics of an Effective CoachCharacteristics of an Effective Coach Compiled from Roussel, 2013; Narayanasamy & Penney, 2014.Be a good listener.

Nurse compe-tencies, performance standards, and educational preparation directly impactpatient safety and quality outcomes. A performance appraisal is a formal evaluation of the work performance of an em- ployee that is conducted by the nurse leader and manager. An effective perform-ance appraisal can foster staff growth and development and promote retention.The employee's performance is evaluated according to the position description andestablished standards of practice. Nurse leaders and managers may use a perform-ance appraisal for the following reasons: To assess a new employee at the conclusion of probationary status to determinewhether the minimum level of performance for a position has been met To provide recognition for accomplishments or constructive feedback when improvement in performance is needed For an annual performance review of the employee's past goals, including per-formance related to position description, and to plan for professional developmentover the next year As with interview questions, some of the laws discussed in Chapter 4 must be considered when conducting a performance appraisal, including the Civil RightsAct, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans With DisabilitiesAct, and the Fair Labor Standards Act. During a performance appraisal, the nurse's performance is weighed against the position description, professional standards of practice, and policies and procedures.The position description reflects legal, regulatory, and accreditation requirements;delineates the employee's roles and responsibilities; and specifies the person to whomthe nurse reports. In addition, the position description outlines expected performancestandards, which are often based on the ANA (2015c) Scope and Standards of Practice and represent the minimal level of acceptable nursing practice. Nurses working in specialtyareas may have standards related to the clinical specialty included in their positiondescription. Performance appraisals should relate only to the nurse's position descrip-tion and expected performance standards and not to the personality of the individual. An effective performance appraisal should promote successful work relation- ships and enhance employee development as well as motivate staff to improve per-formance and productivity (Pearce, 2007). However, nurses may view performanceappraisals as threatening, based on previous negative experiences. Providing fre-quent feedback on a regular basis throughout the review period can lessen fear ofthe process. Nurse leaders and managers should follow these steps when conduct-ing effective performance appraisals (Pearce, 2007): 1.Prepare for the performance appraisal by keeping employee files updated with appropriate data and anecdotal notes that reflect performance observed through-out the review period. This ensures that feedback is based on facts. 2.Plan for the performance appraisal to be conducted in a formal but relaxed at-mosphere. Schedule the performance appraisal at a time that is convenient forthe employee, and ensure there will be no interruptions.Chapter 10 Creating and Managing a Sustainable Workforce 221 3021_Ch10_211-228 16/01/17 10:46 AM Page 2213.Conduct the performance appraisal in such a manner as to encourage produc- tive exchange of ideas and joint problem solving. Review self-appraisal andpeer reviews with the employee, and encourage discussion. 4.Review the employee's achievements and ask whether he or she has achievedgoals set during the previous performance appraisal. 5.Provide the employee feedback on his or her achievements. 6.If the performance appraisal process calls for ratings or scoring, seek input fromthe employee and strive for agreement. 7.Discuss plans for improvement, and assist the employee in identifying areas towork on and developing a realistic plan, but avoid actually developing the planfor the employee. 8.Address the employee's career plans, and offer realistic feedback regarding opportunities for advancements. 9.Assist the employee in developing new goals and objectives for the upcomingyear by using the SMART (specific, measureable, appropriate, realistic, timed)technique. 10.Ask the employee for feedback, including how you can support the employee. 11.Provide an opportunity for the employee to add written comments on the performance appraisal. The performance appraisal should be written and signed by the nurse leader and manager and the employee, and the employee should be provided with a copyof the signed document. Effective nurse leaders and managers use performance appraisals as a way to enhance the work experience for staff, facilitate productivity, promote profession-alism and career development, measure nursing performance, and, ultimately,create joy in the workplace (Roussel, 2013). An important aspect of performance appraisal is a self-assessment or a self- appraisal. A self-appraisal is the process of the employee reflecting on his or her own personal actions and professional performance related to sense of self, values,beliefs, decisions, actions, and outcomes (Porter-O'Grady & Malloch, 2013). Theself-appraisal should include a review of the employee's performance related tothe previous year's goals and list specific accomplishments during the year. Theemployee may want to include feedback from peers as well as from patients andtheir families. An accountable nurse will also acknowledge areas of weakness dur-ing self-appraisal and identify strategies to make changes in practice to improveperformance. Self-appraisal is part of professional autonomy, accountability, andself-regulation in nursing and \"requires personal accountability for the knowledgebase for professional practice, [and reflects] an individual's demonstrated personal222 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS LEARNING ACTIVITY 10-1 Using SMART Use the SMART technique to develop five goals you would like to accomplish during the next year.3021_Ch10_211-228 16/01/17 10:46 AM Page 222control based on principles, guidelines, and rules deemed important\" (ANA, 2010, p. 30). Nurse leaders and managers must also engage in self-appraisal of their ownpractice in relation to professional practice guidelines, standards, statutes, rules,and regulations on a regular basis (ANA, 2016). Another possible element of a performance appraisal is a peer review , in which nurses from common practice areas assess, monitor, and make judgments aboutthe quality of nursing care provided by a nurse peer (Haag-Heitman & George,2011, p. 48). The peer review process also fosters accountability and supports self-regulation. Nurse leaders and managers have a critical role in establishing aneffective peer review process. They may need to coach staff in the peer reviewprocess and encourage the use of constructive feedback versus destructive feed-back. Constructive feedback is supportive, motivates the employee to succeed and grow, and involves showing respect and praising the employee for a job well done(e.g., \"I really appreciate how you handled that difficult patient yesterday\"),whereas destructive feedback includes threats and fear to control employee behavior, by criticizing the employee and making him or her feel humiliated (e.g., \"Are youstupid? You should never walk out of the patient's room with gloves on!\"). Often,nurse leaders and managers are evaluated by superiors based on peer reviews and input from staff related to employee satisfaction, successful recruitment andretention efforts, and quality outcomes. One form of peer review is 360-degree feedback , which is a type of constructive feed- back in which nurses receive feedback from everyone around them\u2014supervisors,peers, physicians, other health-care professionals, and even patients and theirfamilies. Typically, 360-degree feedback is anonymous. The nurse leader andmanager summarizes the feedback and reviews it with the employee. The goalof 360-degree feedback is to provide specific opportunities for the employee touse in his or her development plan. It also provides the nurse leader and man-ager with particular areas in which to coach the nurse for growth and profes-sional development. Peer reviews and 360-degree feedback can be used not only for nurses but also for nurse leaders and managers. Informal and formal feedback on their perform-ance from those they work with as well as from their subordinates can help nurseleaders and managers understand the effects of their leadership style and identifystrengths and weaknesses in their interprofessional and intraprofessional commu-nication skills. This feedback can be used by nurse leaders and managers in theirown professional development. Using Corrective Action The emphasis on patient safety and quality care globally is motivating health-careorganizations to focus attention on recruiting and retaining quality workers. Thismeans keeping excellent employees (the high performers), further developing thegood employees (the middle performers), and forcing the weak or poor employees(the low performers) to leave the organization (Matheny, 2005, p. 296). With regardto middle and low performers, nurse leaders and managers must address deficien-cies and substandard performance immediately to avoid escalation of the behavior.Chapter 10 Creating and Managing a Sustainable Workforce 223 3021_Ch10_211-228 16/01/17 10:46 AM Page 223When substandard performance or deficiencies are identified, these may need to be addressed by the nurse leader and manager through corrective action , a progres- sive process used to improve poor performance. Nurse leaders and managers must explore the deficiencies and determine whether the employee violated rules or policies and procedures or whether thedeficiencies are related to lack of skill or competence. Evidence must be gatheredto establish a case. Minor rule infractions such as tardiness or excessive absencesshould be addressed directly with the employee, and the employee should begiven an opportunity to improve. Typically, this is accomplished through a writ-ten agreement between the employee and the nurse leader and manager thatclearly outlines expected behavior and the consequences should the employeenot meet the expectations. When a major infraction occurs, such as mistreatmentof a patient, use of alcohol at work, or deferring medications from a patient, theemployee should be terminated immediately (more on this later in this section).Nurse leaders and managers are bound by the ANA (2015a) Code of Ethics forNurses with Interpretive Statements to address any and all instances of incompe- tent, unethical, illegal, or impaired practice that compromise the safety or well-being of the patient. Further, any nurse who observes inappropriate behavior or questionable practice by another nurse that jeopardizes the rights or safety of a patient should report these concerns to the supervisor immediately (ANA, 2015a). When establishing a corrective action plan, the nurse leader and manager must first determine the reason for the substandard performance: Is it the result of a lackof knowledge, skill, or experience, or did the employee violate policy or procedure?Next, the nurse leader and manager should address the behavior with a progressivecorrective action plan according to the organization's policy and procedure; theplan may include a verbal reprimand, a written reprimand, suspension with orwithout pay, and termination. Corrective action should include constructive feed-back to improve behavior or performance, rather than destructive feedback, whichdoes not encourage the employee to succeed and can be detrimental to his or her development. Nurse leaders and managers must explore their approach to corrective action and adopt constructive techniques whenever possible. Table 10-2outlines the nurse leader and manager's role in corrective action. Once poor performance is addressed and the employee meets the conditions of the corrective action plan, the incident should not be held against the em-ployee unless the behavior is repeated. It is unfair to bring up poor performancein the next performance appraisal if it has not been a problem since the employeemet the conditions of the corrective action plan. However, if the employee repeats the behavior, and continued efforts to assist him or her in meeting theminimum standards of performance are not successful, termination may be nec-essary (McConnell, 2011). Terminating an employee is a painstaking process. It requires the nurse leader and manager to conduct a thorough investigation of the incident, collect pertinentdata and materials related to performance (e.g., policies and procedures, positiondescription, and standards of practice), and objectively formulate a judgment based224 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS 3021_Ch10_211-228 16/01/17 10:46 AM Page 224on the facts (Cohen, 2006; Hader, 2006). The nurse leader and manager should seek advice from human resources to ensure that the necessary information and docu-ments have been collected to support the termination before contacting the em-ployee to set up a meeting (Cohen, 2006). Planning the meeting in three segmentsis a strategy the nurse leader and manager can use to present the decision in a pro-fessional manner and stay on track. First, the nurse manager or leader should statethe reason for the meeting. Second, details of the incident should be presented. Thenurse leader and manager must stay objective during this phase and present factsrelated to the event and the specific policies and procedures and standards thatwere violated. Third, the employee should be informed of his or her terminationin as straightforward a manner as possible. Terminating an employee is a difficultand stressful task; following a standard procedure, including carefully reviewingall facts, remaining objective, and making an informed decision, only makes it easier(Cohen, 2006; Hader, 2006). Nurse leaders and managers must ensure that reasonable efforts have been taken to help employees succeed. Allowing poor performance to continue without actioncan have a deleterious effect on the work environment. Staff morale can be nega-tively impacted when staff members feel that the poor performance of a nurse isnot dealt with in a timely manner or is ignored. In fact, nurses who are high per-formers may begin to slow down their performance, reduce the quality of theirown work, or leave an organization if they perceive that nurse leaders and man-agers tolerate those who are unwilling or unable to perform at a level necessary todeliver safe and quality care (Matheny, 2005).Chapter 10 Creating and Managing a Sustainable Workforce 225 Table 10-2 Corrective Action Plan First: An informal, verbal reprimand is given. Second: A written reprimand is given. Third: Violation occurs a third time and/or there is no improvement.

In addition, nurseleaders and managers must promote a healthy work environment and implementplans to make the workplace generationally friendly to sustain a competent work-force. Nurse leaders and managers must also effectively manage the workforce. Todo so, nurse leaders and managers must consider the nurse's performance relatedto the position description and organizational performance standards. Performanceappraisals can improve staff morale, productivity, and job satisfaction. Finally,nurse managers and leaders must deal with violations of policies and proceduresand poor performance immediately to avoid escalation of the problem. Regardlessof the reason for poor performance, the goal of corrective action should be to helpthe employee succeed in his or her position. 226 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS Unionization and Collective Bargaining A union is an organization of employees who join together to have a voice and collectively improve working con- ditions (American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations [AFL-CIO], 2015a). The purposebehind unions is to ensure that employees have respect on the job and a voice in improving the quality of thework, products, and services. Unions also provide a counterbalance to the unchecked power of management (International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, n.d.). In 1935, the National Labor Relations Act was establishedto support the rights of workers to form and join unions and participate in collective bargaining (AFL-CIO,2015a). Collective bargaining is the process by which working people \"negotiate a contract with their employersto determine their terms of employment, including pay, benefits, hours, leave, job health and safety policies,ways to balance work and family and more\" (AFL-CIO, 2015b, para. 1). The negotiated contract or collective bargaining agreement is legally binding and enforced under federal and state law. Unions and collective bargaining agreements represent a mechanism for nurses to gain and maintain control over professional practice and \"combat management systems that threaten patient safety, quality of care,and the nurses' work environment\" (Budd, Warino, & Patton, 2004). Additional types of benefits negotiated fornurses include overtime, use of temporary nurses, provisions for continuing education and staff development,whistleblower protection, health provisions (e.g., free vaccinations), and grievance and arbitration procedures(Budd, Warino, & Patton, 2004). The ANA supports the rights of RNs to unionize and participate in collective bargaining (ANA, 2015b). Nurse leaders and managers have a responsibility to ensure that nurses are treated fairly and justly and that they are involved in decisions related to their practice and working conditions (ANA, 2015a, p.24). There are severalnurse unions available for nurses to join. The National Federation of Nurses (NFN; www.nfn.org) is affiliated with theAmerican Federation of Teachers and is one of the leading national labor unions for RNs. The primary functions ofthe NFN are to advocate and provide a voice for RNs at the national level and to provide support, education, and assistance to member associations (Montana, Ohio, Oregon, and Washington State) (NFN, n.d.). The NationalNurses United (NNU; www.nationalnursesunited.org) is the largest union for RNs and has members in every state in the United States. The NNU was formed through the merger of the California Nurses Association/National NursesOrganizing Committee, United American Nurses, and Massachusetts Nurses Association (NNU, 2010-2016). Thegoals of the NNU are to advance the interests of direct care nurses and patients across the United States, organizeall direct-care RNs, promote effective collective bargaining repres entations to all NNU affiliates, expand the voice of direct care RNs, and promote accessible, quality health care for all as a human right (NNU, 2010-2016).3021_Ch10_211-228 16/01/17 10:46 AM Page 226SUGGESTED WEBSITES National Council State Boards of Nursing: NCSBN Transition to Practice: ncsbn.org/transition-to-practice.htm National Council of State Boards of Nursing: NCSBN TTP Novice to Expert Grid: ncsbn.org/Preceptor-NovicetoExpertchar.pdf REFERENCES American Association of Critical-Care Nurses.

The primary goal when organizing patient care is delivering safe and quality nursing care using available resources effectively. In this chapter, the major components of organizing patient care are covered, including identifying, implementing, and monitoring a care delivery model; deter-mining staffing needs for safe and quality care; developing and implementing astaffing plan; monitoring productivity; and evaluating staffing effectiveness. Knowledge, skills, and attitudes related to the following core competencies are included: patient-centered care, teamwork and collaboration, quality improvement,informatics, and safety. CARE DELIVERY MODELS Care delivery models are used to organize and deliver nursing care and focus on structure, process, and outcomes (Duffield, Roche, Diers, Catling-Paull, Blay, 2010; Neisner &Raymond, 2002; Wolf & Greenhouse, 2007). Additionally, care delivery models serveto drive assessments, decisions, planning, organization, and evaluation of structures,processes, and outcomes (Wolf & Greenhouse, 2007). These models have evolved overthe past century in response to issues such as war, politics, economics, social environ-ment, technology, and advances in health care. The care delivery model used in an organization is usually determined by nurse leaders and managers at the executivelevel, with the model chosen reflective of the organizational mission, philosophy, andgoals. Nurse leaders and managers at the unit level should have input regarding themodel chosen to ensure that it is appropriate for the unit, skill mix, number of nursingpersonnel available, and the acuity of the patients. Unit level leaders and managersare also responsible for implementing, monitoring, and evaluating the effectiveness,efficiency, and outcomes of the selected care delivery model. Frontline nurses shouldassist in monitoring and evaluating outcomes of the process. Nursing care delivery models address five questions (Neisner & Raymond, 2002, p. 8): 1.Who is responsible for making decisions about patient care? 2.How long do that person's decisions remain in effect? 3.How is work distributed among staff members: by task or by patient? 4.How is patient care communication handled? 5.How is the whole unit managed?Care delivery models must foster effective communication and also balance the needs of the patients with the competencies and availability of the nursing staff. Models of care provide for continuity of care across the continuum and give nursesthe authority and responsibility for the provision of nursing care (Kaplow & Reed,2008). To be effective, care delivery models should be in alignment with the organ-ization, sustainable over time, and replicable (Wolf & Greenhouse, 2007). Regardlessof the care delivery model employed, nurse leaders and managers have a respon-sibility to ensure that safe and quality patient care is provided by competent nurs-ing staff. The American Organization of Nurse Executives (AONE, 2010) contendsthat nurse leaders and managers will need to participate in redesigning nursing230 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS 3021_Ch11_229-253 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 230care delivery in the future by focusing on patient- and family-centered care, ensur- ing that frontline nurses participate in the decision-making process, and optimizingnursing roles and care across the continuum. In addition, the AONE includes effective use of delivery models as a component of the knowledge of the health-care environment competency (AONE, 2015, p. 6) in the following ways: Demonstrate current knowledge of patient care delivery systems across the continuum. Describe various delivery systems and patient care models and the advantages/disadvantages of each. Assess the effectiveness of new care delivery models. Align care delivery models and staff performance with key safety and economicdrivers. There are many care delivery models in use today, classified as traditional, nontraditional, and contemporary models. Traditional Models Traditional care models are rooted in nursing's historical beginnings. The best-known traditional models of care delivery are total patient care, functional nurs-ing, team nursing, primary nursing, and nursing case management. Many of thesemodels are still in use today, with many newer models incorporating aspects oftraditional models. Total Patient Care Total patient care , also known as case method, is the oldest model of care delivery. At the turn of the 20th century, nursing care took place in the patient's home. The nursewas responsible for complete nursing care of the patient as well as other duties, suchas cooking and cleaning. As nursing care transitioned into the hospital in the 1930s,total patient care remained the principal care delivery model (Tiedeman & Lookin-land, 2004). In the total patient care method, often used in settings such as criticalcare and hospice care, the nurse provides holistic care. When used in a hospital set-ting, total patient care is provided by one nurse during a shift; communication is hi-erarchical, and the charge nurse is responsible for making assignments, interfacingwith physicians, and shift reports. Some variations of this method are in use today. Functional Nursing During World War II, a nursing shortage developed in response to increased de-mands for nurses abroad, resulting in a need to reorganize nursing care in hospitalsstateside. Functional nursing was implemented as a means to accomplish patient care with the assistance of ancillary personnel. In this model, staff members work side byside and are assigned to complete specific tasks, such as passing medications, takingvital signs, and providing hygiene, for all or many patients on a unit (Tiedeman & Lookinland, 2004). Although it was intended to be used as a temporary mode ofcare delivery until nurses returned from the war, with the increase in population afterChapter 11 Organizing Patient Care 231 3021_Ch11_229-253 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 231World War II functional nursing continued in popularity because of efficient man- agement of time, tasks, and resources. Because this model allows care to be providedby a limited number of registered nurses (RNs), it is often used today in long-termcare and ambulatory care facilities. Although the functional model is viewed as effi-cient and cost effective, it can also result in fragmented care because nurses focus onphysician's orders and necessary tasks. This model does not promote autonomy orprofessional development (Tiedeman & Lookinland, 2004). Communication is hier-archical, and the charge nurse is primarily responsible for assigning shifts, supervis-ing tasks, interfacing with physicians, and writing shift reports. Team Nursing In response to criticism of functional nursing, team nursing was designed. In team nursing, licensed and unlicensed personnel collaborate to deliver total care for agroup of patients under the direction of a team leader. Typically, the team leaderis an RN and is responsible for the following: assigning duties to team members,based on licensure, education, ability, and competence; supervising care provided;and providing more complex care. In this model, the team leader must have effective communication skills and the necessary experience to provide strongleadership for his or her team (Tiedeman & Lookinland, 2004). Typically, the teamleader is responsible for interfacing with physicians and providing shift reportsto the oncoming team leader. In some modifications, communication can be hier-archical, and the charge nurse is responsible for related tasks directly. Someadapted versions of team nursing are still in use today on medical-surgical units. Primary Nursing Developed in 1968, primary nursing brought the RN back to the bedside. Initially, this model was developed for inpatient units on which an RN managed care for a groupof patients for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week throughout their hospital stay (Manthey,2009). When the primary nurse is not available, an associate nurse cares for the samegroup of patients and follows the plan of care developed by the primary nurse. The primary nursing model fosters a strong relationship between the nurse and thepatient and his or her family because much of the decision making occurs at thebedside (Tiedeman & Lookinland, 2004). Primary nursing is popular in situationsin which one nurse manages care for an extended number of hours or on a long-term basis, such as in ambulatory care units and home health-care settings (Manthey,2009). In this model, communication is lateral, with the primary nurse being respon-sible for direct care, interfacing with physicians and other members of the health-care team, and providing shift reports. Nursing Case Management In an attempt to improve the cost effectiveness of patient care, nursing case management emerged in the late 1980s (Neisner & Raymond, 2002). Nursing case managementwas borrowed from social work, psychiatric settings, and community health. Thegoal of nursing case management is to organize patient care according to major 232 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS 3021_Ch11_229-253 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 232diagnostic-related groups to achieve measurable quality outcomes while meeting predetermined time frames and costs. Case management focuses on decreasing frag-mented care, improving patient self-care and quality of life, and optimizing use ofresources and decreasing costs (Neisner & Raymond, 2002, p. 11). The RN functionsas a case manager and is assigned to coordinate care for high-risk populations, suchas patients with congestive heart failure, and manage care from admission throughdischarge. Historically, case management was used primarily in the hospital setting,but it now extends to community settings. The RN case manager typically has earnedan advanced degree and rarely provides direct care. Case management improvescommunication among health-care professionals and is identified as an approach toimprove patient safety while transitioning patients among levels of care. Nontraditional Models During the 1980s and into the 1990s, the health-care system experienced many chal-lenges, including pressure to cut health-care expenses. In an effort to reduce costs,hospitals examined strategies to change how patient care was delivered. The resultconsisted of nontraditional models of nursing care that borrowed from team nurs-ing and included the incorporation of unlicensed assistive personnel (UAPs). Themost popular models of nontraditional care delivery are patient-focused care, part-nership models, nonclinical models, and integrated models (Lookinland, Tiedeman,& Crosson, 2005; Neisner & Raymond, 2002). Regardless of the care delivery model used, nurse leaders and managers must ensure that nurses deliver culturally competent, safe, effective, and quality care. Inaddition, nurse leaders and managers must support nursing control of nursingpractice, respect nurses' rights and responsibilities, and respect patients' rights andpreferences (American Nurses Association [ANA], 2015c). Patient-Focused Care Patient-focused care revolves around a multiskilled team approach to nursing care. In this model, the RN functions as the patient care manager and coordinates all patient-related activities. Goals of patient-focused care are to make nursing caremore patient centered rather than caregiver centered, reduce the number of care-givers a patient sees during a hospital stay, and increase direct patient care time forRNs (Jones, DeBaca, & Yarbrough, 1997). In the most extreme forms of patient-focused care, all patient care services are brought to the patient. In some cases, entireunits are decentralized, meaning that all staff members from housekeeping, dietary,physical therapy, and nursing are employees of that specific unit. Ultimately, patient-focused care decreases the cost of providing health care while improvingthe quality of services (Myers, 1998). In this model, communication is lateral, andthe team interfaces with the health-care providers. Partnership Models Partnership models emerged in the late 1980s with the goal of decreasing the cost of nursing care while increasing productivity. Examples include Partnership inChapter 11 Organizing Patient Care 233 3021_Ch11_229-253 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 233Practice (PIP), Partnership to Improve Patient Care (PIPC), and nurse extender models. In the PIP model, the RN hires the UAP , and they work as clinical part-ners on the same schedule; UAPs may be cross-trained to perform skills such asphlebotomy and dressing changes, thus allowing them to work with the RN toprovide direct patient care (Manthey, 1989). The PIPC and nurse extender modelsare similar to the PIP model in that the UAPs are cross-trained to perform addi-tional skills and typically work the same schedules as their RN partners; how-ever, the RN is not involved in hiring (Lookinland, Tiedeman, & Crosson, 2005).Partnership models offer more continuity of care than team nursing and are morecost effective than primary nursing. In partnership models, communication islateral, and RNs coordinate the care, provide direct patient care, and remain accountable for all patients. Nonclinical Models In nonclinical models, UAPs may or may not be partnered with the RN and do notprovide direct patient care. In this model, the UAP's role is supportive and includesnonclinical tasks such as assisting patients with hygiene needs, feeding patients,answering call lights, ordering supplies, and transporting patients (Lookinland,Tiedeman, & Crosson, 2005). In the nonclinical model, RNs are responsible for coordinating care, and communication is lateral. Integrated Models In integrated models, UAPs provide both direct care and indirect care. In somecases, the UAP is responsible for combined duties, such as housekeeping and foodservice (Lookinland, Tiedeman, & Crosson, 2005). RNs may work with only a UAPor with a licensed practical nurse (LPN)/licensed vocational nurse (LVN) and aUAP . The goal of integrated models is to relieve RNs of non-nursing tasks to im-prove the quality of patient care. In this model, the RN coordinates all nursing care,and communication is lateral. Contemporary Models Contemporary models of care, also called innovative models, are the newest approaches to organizing patient care to foster patient safety and quality outcomes.Contemporary models include the Professional Nursing Practice Model, the Differentiated Nursing Practice Model, the Clinical Nurse Leader Model, the Synergy Model for Patient Care, Transforming Care at the Bedside, and the Patient-and Family-Centered Care Model. Professional Nursing Practice Model The Professional Nursing Practice Model provides \"a framework for guiding and align- ing clinical practice, education, administration, and research in order to achievepositive patient and nurse staff outcomes\" (Lineweaver, 2013, p. 14.) This model isidentified as a core feature of Magnet hospitals (Neisner & Raymond, 2002) because234 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS 3021_Ch11_229-253 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 234Magnet hospitals typically have higher RN-to-patient ratios, and many of these hospitals are moving to all-RN staffs. In this model, RNs have greater autonomyand control over practice, and there are higher rates of patient satisfaction, lowerrates of nurse burnout, and safer work environments (Neisner & Raymond, 2002).This model supports the RN's control over the delivery of nursing care as well aseffective interprofessional and intraprofessional communication. Differentiated Nursing Practice Model The Differentiated Nursing Practice Model resulted from a meeting between the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) and the AONE in 1993, when membersof a joint Task Force sat down together to develop a set of formal goals and recom-mendations regarding differentiated nursing practice (AACN-AONE Task Force,1995). Care in this model is differentiated based on the level of education, competence,and clinical expertise of RNs: nurses with an associate degree function as technicalnurses and provide the majority of bedside care; baccalaureate-prepared nurses func-tion on a broader scale, collaborating and facilitating patient care from admissionthrough discharge; and advanced practice nurses function within the broad health-care system and provide care across all settings throughout wellness and death. Thegoals of this model include the following (Neisner & Raymond, 2002, p. 11): Optimal nursing care matching patients' needs with the nurse's competencies Effective and efficient use of scarce nursing resources Equitable compensation Increased career satisfaction among nurses Greater loyalty to the employer Enhanced prestige of the nursing profession In the differentiated nursing practice environment, nurses must be clinically competent and flexible in providing nursing care, and they must value the differingroles. Nurse leaders and managers must match the unique capabilities of nurseswith patient care requirements. Differentiated nursing practice recognizes that allnurses, regardless of education, are needed to provide high-quality, comprehensivecare to all patients in all settings (AACN-AONE Task Force, 1995). Clinical Nurse Leader Model The Clinical Nurse Leader (CNL) Model was developed with the goal to improve the qual- ity of patient care across the continuum and as a way to engage highly skilled clini-cians in outcome-based practice and quality improvement (AACN, 2013). Thegraduate of a Master's degree program, the CNL has responsibilities including de-signing, implementing, and evaluating patient care by coordinating, delegating, andsupervising the care provided by an interprofessional team. The nurse in this role isthe leader in the health-care delivery system and is not in an administrative or man-agerial role. \"The CNL assumes accountability for patient-care outcomes throughassimilation and application of evidence-based information to design, implement,and evaluate patient-care processes and models of care delivery\" (AACN, 2013,para. 4). The CNL is a provider and coordinator of care and fosters interprofessionalChapter 11 Organizing Patient Care 235 3021_Ch11_229-253 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 235and intraprofessional communication. The CNL graduate is eligible to sit for the CNL certification offered by the Commission on Nurse Certification. Synergy Model for Patient Care The American Association of Critical-Care Nurses developed the Synergy Model for Patient Care with the core concepts that the needs of patients and families influence and drive the competencies of nurses and that synergy occurs when the needs andcharacteristics of the patient, clinical unit, or system are matched with the nurse'scompetencies (American Association of Critical-Care Nurses, n.d.). It is a frameworkthat can be used to organize patient care in various settings. Because each patientand family is unique, has characteristics that span the health-illness continuum, andhas varying capacity for health and vulnerability to illness, the model includes eightpatient characteristics (Table 11-1) and eight nursing characteristics (Table 11-2) derived from patients' needs (American Association of Critical-Care Nurses, n.d.).Assessment data collected based on the patient characteristics can assist nurses inthe development of individualized plans of nursing care. This model fosters effectivecommunication and collaboration in achieving optimal, realistic patient and familygoals. Although the model was originally developed for critical care units, it hasbeen used in a variety of clinical settings. Transforming Care at the Bedside A national initiative launched by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement in 2003, Transforming Care at the Bedside (TCAB) is a care model that empowers frontline nurses and nurse leaders and managers to(Lee, Shannon, Rutherford, & Peck, 2008; Rutherford, Moen, & Taylor, 2009): Improve the safety and quality of patient care on medical-surgical units Increase the vitality and retention of nurses236 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS Table 11-1 Synergy Model: Characteristics of Patients and Families With Definitions From American Association of Critical-Care Nurses, n.d., pp. 1-3.Resiliency Vulnerability StabilityComplexityResource availability Participation in care Participation in decision makingPredictabilityThe capacity to return to a restorative level of functioning using compensatory or copingmechanisms; the ability to bounce back quickly after an insultSusceptibility to actual or potential stressors that may adversely affect patient outcomes The ability to maintain steady-state equilibriumThe intricate entanglement of two or more systems (e.g., body, family, therapies)Extent of resources (e.g., technical, fiscal, personal, psychological, and social) the patientor family brings to the situationExtent to which patient or family engages in aspects of careExtent to which patient or family engages in decision making A characteristic that allows one to expect a certain course of events or course of illnessCharacteristics Definitions3021_Ch11_229-253 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 236Engage and improve patients' and their family's experiences of care Improve the effectiveness of the entire health-care team The goal of TCAB is to empower nurses and other health-care team members to redesign work processes to improve the quality of patient care and decrease turnover. The initiative brings the health-care team together to collaborate on im-proving the quality of care. The framework includes \"optimizing communicationamong clinicians and staff\" as one of the four essential building blocks for improving staff vitality and enhancing patient safety (Lee, Shannon, Rutherford,& Peck, 2008, p. 4). Five themes comprise the TCAB model of care (Rutherford,Moen, & Taylor, 2009): 1.Transformational leadership: Leadership and management practices empower frontline staff, and this empowerment is critical to ensuring that innovations are sustained. The success of TCAB depends on the commitment of leaders andmanagers across the health-care system. 2.Safe and reliable care: Health-care teams can respond immediately to changes in a patient's condition. Processes are in place to prevent medication errors, injuriesfrom falls, pressure ulcers, and harm from adverse events. Additionally, the caredelivered is effective and equitable. 3.Vitality and teamwork: When the health-care team functions in a joyful and sup- portive environment, teamwork is effective and communication is optimized.Health-care teams strive for excellence.Chapter 11 Organizing Patient Care 237 Table 11-2 Synergy Model: Nurse Competencies With Definitions From American Association of Critical-Care Nurses, n.d., pp. 4-8.Clinical judgment Advocacy and moral agency Caring practices CollaborationSystems thinking Response to diversityFacilitation of learningClinical inquiry (innovator/evaluator)Clinical reasoning, which includes clinical decision making, critical thinking, and aglobal grasp of the situation, coupled with nursing skills acquired through a process ofintegrating formal and informal experiential knowledge and evidence-based guidelinesWorking on another's behalf and representing the concerns of the patient or familyand nursing staff; serving as a moral agent in identifying and helping to resolve ethical and clinical concerns within and outside the clinical settingNursing activities that create a compassionate, supportive, and therapeutic environ-ment for patients and staff, with the aim of promoting comfort and healing and preventing unwanted sufferingWorking with others (e.g., patients, families, health-care providers) in a way that promotes or encourages each person's contributions toward achieving optimal or realistic patient or family goalsBody of knowledge and tools that allow the nurse to manage whatever environmentaland system resources exist for the patient or family and staffThe sensitivity to recognize, appreciate, and incorporate differences into the provisionof careThe ability to facilitate learning for patients or families, nursing staff, other membersof the health-care team, and communityThe ongoing process of questioning and evaluating practice and providing informedpractice Competencies Definitions3021_Ch11_229-253 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 2374.Patient-centered care: Care is focused on the \"whole person and family, respects individual values and choices and ensures continuity of care\" (p. 13). 5.Value-added care processes: Patient care is free of waste, promotes continuous flow of work, and decreases redundancy. Nurses can spend more time on activities that have value for the patient and family. Since the initiative was launched in 2007, many health-care agencies in the United States and internationally have applied improvement strategies used in TCAB for engaging frontline nurses in deciding on and implementing changes toimprove patient outcomes. The TCAB model has the potential to transform caredelivery and the work environment for nurses and to support interprofessionalteamwork and communication at the bedside (Rutherford, Moen, & Taylor, 2009). Patient- and Family-Centered Care Model Health care is plagued with many problems that require systemwide solutions andpartnerships with health-care professionals, administrators, planners, policy makers,and patients and their families (Conway et al., 2006). For health-care professionalsto provide safe and quality care effectively, a shift is required from provider-centered care to patient-centered care . Additionally, as patients are becoming more knowledgeable and informed, and taking care into their own hands, nurses mustbe prepared to advocate strongly for patients and their families as they navigatethe health-care system. The Institute for Patient- and Family-Centered Care (IPFCC) is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to advance the understanding and practices of patient- and family-centered care and to integrate the core concepts of dignity andrespect, information sharing, participation, and collaboration into all aspects ofhealth care (IPFCC, 2011). The IPFCC defines patient- and family-centered care as: An approach to the planning, delivery, and evaluation of health care that is grounded in mutually beneficial partnerships among health care providers, patients, and families. ... an approach to health care that shapes policies, programs, facility design, and staff day-to-day interactions. It leads to better health outcomes and wiser allocation of resources and greaterpatient and family satisfaction. (IPFCC, 2010, para. 1). Patient- and family-centered care places an emphasis on collaborating and plan- ning care with patients (and their families) of all ages, at all levels of care, and in all health-care settings (Conway et al., 2006). Patient- and family-centered care shouldnever be confused with patient-focused care mentioned earlier in this chapter. In thepatient-focused care model, the RN is the coordinator and planner of care who bringsas many care services to the patient as possible; in patient- and family-centered care,the patient has control over his or her care, and all health-care decisions are madewith the RN as a collaborator in his or her care. The model of patient- and family-centered care is based on four foundational concepts (Conway et al., 2006): 1.Dignity and respect: Health-care professionals listen to and respect the values and choices of the patient and family, and the values, beliefs, and cultural backgrounds of the patient and family are integrated into the planning and delivery of care.238 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS 3021_Ch11_229-253 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 2382.Information sharing: Health-care professionals communicate and share all infor- mation with patients and families in a timely manner. Patients and families receive comprehensive and accurate information to participate in care and deci-sion making effectively. 3.Participation: Patients and families are encouraged and supported in participating in care and decision making at the level they choose. 4.Collaboration: Patients and families as well as health-care professionals and lead- ers collaborate in policy and program development, implementation, and eval-uation; health-care facility design; professional education; and delivery of care(Conway et al., 2006). Nurses are strategically positioned to be the catalysts for integrating this model into practice. The nurse-patient relationship is inherently built on mutual trust, respect, and communication. In patient- and family-centered care, nurses initiateand promote a safe healing environment, respond to individual patients' choices,recognize patients as the source of control, effectively communicate with patientsand their families, and provide all necessary information for patients to make aninformed health-care decision. The model of patient- and family-centered care cantransform the experience of care for patients and families and of caregiving for allhealth-care professionals. STAFFING FOR PATIENT SAFETY Appropriate staffing is critical to the delivery of quality care. \"Appropriate staffing is a match of registered nurse expertise with the needs of the recipient of nursing careservices in the context of the practice setting and situation\" (ANA, 2012, p. 6). Nurseleaders and managers are responsible for making sure to have the appropriate number and mix of nursing staff at all times. Because staffing affects the ability ofa nurse to deliver safe and effective care at every practice level and in all settings,staffing is a complex process (ANA, 2012). Nurse leaders and managers must un-derstand and follow federal, state, and local regulations related to staffing andscheduling; uphold nurse practice acts; verify and track licensure of nursing staff;respect nurses' rights; ensure staff competencies; and substantiate staff compliancewith regulatory and professional standards (ANA, 2015c). Safe staffing results in fewer hospital-acquired infections, reduces nurse fatigue, decreases nurse turnover, reduces hospital costs, improves patient satisfaction, andincreases nurse productivity (ANA, 2015a). Research in the United States specifi-cally indicates that when units are staffed with more RNs, patients experience fewercomplications, fewer urinary tract infections and cases of pneumonia, shorterlengths of stay, and decreased mortality rates (Aiken, Clarke, Sloane, & Silber, 2002; et al., 2011; Unruh, 2008). On an international scale, a Registered Nurse Forecasting (RN4CAST) study reflected similar findings: \"Improved patient-to-nurse staffing ratios, sound nursing work environments, anda better educated nurse workforce are associated with improved nurse wellbeingand better patient outcomes, including higher patient satisfaction and lower patientmortality rates\" (European Commission, 2016, para. 1). Inadequate nurse staffingChapter 11 Organizing Patient Care 239 3021_Ch11_229-253 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 239is often cited as a contributing factor when unanticipated events happen that result in patient injury, disability, or death. In addition, inadequate nurse staffing cancause nurses to experience job dissatisfaction, burnout, high \"intent to quit\" levels,and injury or illness (Unruh, 2008). Safe staffing fosters a positive environment for nursing practice by allowing nurses to apply the knowledge they have gained through education and practiceexperiences efficiently and effectively when caring for patients. Staffing must be effective to achieve positive outcomes for patients and the health-care organization. Ensuring safe staffing is not an easy task for nurse leaders and managers, but it can be achieved by dynamic, multifaceted decision-making processes that considera wide range of variables (ANA, 2012). The greatest challenge faced by nurse lead-ers and managers in maintaining safe staffing is the nursing shortage. Shortage of Nurses The nursing shortage is widespread globally (Knudson, 2013), and it affects allareas of nursing. This shortage is occurring at the same time the U.S. Departmentof Labor is suggesting that the need for nurses in outpatient settings, ambulatorycare centers, outpatient surgery centers, and urgent care centers is rapidly increas-ing. The key to an ample supply of nurses in the future is the nation's ability toproduce new nurses. The number of nurses passing the NCLEX-RN licensure examination increased from 68,561 in 2001 to 142,390 in 2011; although this repre-sents substantial growth in the nursing workforce, this growth is concentrated atthe younger and older ends of the age spectrum, with the fewest RNs between theages of 36 and 45 years old (Health Resources and Services Administration[HRSA], 2013). As of 2013, approximately one-third of the nursing workforce wasolder than 50 years, and the average age of an RN was 46.6 years old. Close to 1 million RNs will be retiring in the next 10 to 15 years, and this change will dra-matically impact the number of nurses, as well as lead to a loss of experience,knowledge, and leadership of seasoned RNs (HRSA, 2013). It is anticipated that the nursing shortage will reach 1.2 million by 2020. Besides the high number of RNs expected to retire in the near future, there are several additional contributing factors (AACN, 2014, pp. 2-4): Nursing school enrollment is not growing fast enough to meet the projected demandfor RN and advanced practice RN services. Although there has been an increase in enrollments in entry-level baccalaureate programs over the past few years, itwill not provide enough RNs to meet the need. The passage of the AffordableCare Act has increased the need for RNs and advanced practice RNs as morethan 32 million Americans have gained access to health-care services. A shortage of nursing school faculty is restricting nursing program enrollments. Nursing schools have been forced to turn away qualified applicants because of insufficientnumbers of faculty, clinical sites, classroom spaces, and clinical preceptors, as wellas budget constraints, with faculty shortages noted as the major reason for not accepting qualified applicants into programs. Changing demographic factors signal a need for more nurses to care for our aging population.The demand for more nurses will increase as more baby boomers reach 60 years240 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS 3021_Ch11_229-253 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 240old and older. However, the current numbers indicate that as the older population increases, the number of nurses available to care for them will decrease. Insufficient staffing is raising the stress level of nurses, impacting job satisfaction, anddriving many nurses to leave the profession. Research supports the notion that the nursing shortage increases personal stress, lowers patient care quality, and causesnurses to leave the profession. High nurse turnover and vacancy rates are affecting access to health care. Newly licensed RNs have a high rate of job change after only 1 year, and the overall RNturnover rates and vacancy rates remain close to 15%. The impact of the nursing shortage is surely felt by nurse leaders and managers as they attempt to staff their patient care areas safely. To provide safe and qualitycare effectively, there are many factors that must be considered by nurse leadersand managers when establishing safe staffing plans. Core Concepts of Staffing Historically, staffing decisions were dictated by the number of patients on the unitand fixed nurse-to-patient ratios; this method did not consider the needs of the patientsor the nurses' levels of education, expertise, and work satisfaction. Staffing and work-load are part of a complex process that can negatively impact patient and nurse out-comes (Unruh, 2008). For example, when nurses believe that they cannot deliverquality care, they become dissatisfied with the work, and this can negatively impactpatient satisfaction and outcomes and becomes \"a vicious cycle: inadequate staffingleads to reduced job performance and diminished patient and nurse satisfaction; theresulting burnout and high turnover rates worsen staffing levels\" (Unruh, 2008, p. 64). To ensure positive patient and nurse outcomes, nurse leaders and managers must consider critical factors, such as number of patients, intensity of care, contex-tual issues, and level of expertise when determining staffing needs. Although costeffectiveness is an important factor in the delivery of safe and quality care, the re-imbursement structure should not influence the staffing plan. Rather, nurse leadersand managers must consider the staffing needs and staffing plan for the unit whendeveloping the fiscal budget. It is critical that health-care organizations considerthe financial impact of patient outcomes when evaluating the cost of nurse staffing. To deal with staffing most effectively, understanding core concepts related to staffing is critical for nurse leaders and managers. Important concepts include full-time equivalent, productive time, average daily census, staffing mix, workload,units of service, nursing hours per patient day (NHPPD), unit intensity, patientacuity, and skill mix. Full-Time Equivalent Full-time equivalent (FTE) is a unit that measures the work of one full-time employee for 1 year (or 52 weeks) based on a 40-hour work week, equating a total of 2,080 paid hours per year. An FTE may comprise one person working full-time or several people sharing the full-time hours. For example, two nurses working 20 hours/week equate to one FTE. Chapter 11 Organizing Patient Care 241 3021_Ch11_229-253 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 241Productive Time Productive time refers to the actual hours worked on the unit caring for patients. In con- trast, nonproductive time refers to benefit time, such as vacation hours, holiday time, sick hours, education time, and jury duty. When determining staffing needs, the manager accounts for nurses who are using benefit time and who in turn need to be replacedby additional staff. To determine available productive time for each FTE, the managermust subtract nonproductive time from the total hours a full-time employee works. Average Daily Census Average daily census (ADC) is the average total number of patients when census is taken (at midnight) over a given period of time, such as weekly, monthly, or yearly.ADC helps nurse leaders and managers project staffing needs of the unit. Staffing Mix Staffing mix refers to the appropriate numbers of RNs, LPNs/LVNs, and UAPs needed on a unit, and it is based on the type of care required for specific patientsand who is qualified to provide such care. Determining the staffing mix requiresnurse leaders and managers to assess staff competency and make sure that all staffmembers have the necessary skills to carry out assigned and delegated tasks. Ahigher-RN staff mix provides more staffing flexibility. Workload and Units of Service Workload is the number of nursing staff members required to deliver care for a spe- cific time period and is dependent on patient care needs. Units of service (UOS) reflect the basic measure of nursing workload based on different types of patient encoun-ters (Table 11-3). Staffing needs vary by clinical setting. UOS assist nurse leadersand managers in determining unit-specific needs for staffing. One example of workload is nursing hours per patient day (NHPPD), which rep- resents the nursing care hours provided to patients by nursing personnel over a24-hour period. NHPPD is usually based on unit census at midnight and reflectsonly nursing staff productive time. NHPPD is discussed further in Chapter 16.The formula to calculate NHPPD is illustrated in Box 11-1 through the calculationof NHPPD for an inpatient medical-surgical unit.242 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS Table 11-3 Units of Service by Type of Unit or Department Emergency department Inpatient unitHome careLabor and deliveryOperating roomPatient visits per dayPatient visits per monthBirths per monthMinutes per caseType of Unit or Department Units of Service (UOS)3021_Ch11_229-253 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 242Unit Intensity Unit intensity takes into account the totality of the patients for whom care is provided and the responsibilities of nursing staff. Unit intensity is very valuable in deter- mining staffing because it takes into consideration admissions, transfers, and discharges (ANA, 2012). However, unit intensity can be difficult to measure in viewof the many factors that influence it, such as severity of illness, patient dependencyfor activities of daily living, complexity of care, and amount of time needed to deliver care (Beglinger, 2006). Patient Acuity Patient acuity represents how patients are categorized according to an assessment of their nursing care needs (Harper & McCully, 2007). It is a critical factor in deter-mining safe staffing. Patient classification systems are tools used to determinestaffing based on patient acuity. Typically, patients with more acute conditions orsicker patients receive higher classification scores to indicate that they need moredirect nursing care. Skill Mix Skill mix refers to the varying levels of education, licensure, certifications, and experience of the staff. Skill mix can include a team made up of various numbersof RNs, LPNs, and UAPs. Determining the skill mix occurs on every shift and depends on many factors, such as the model of care delivery, patient population,patient acuity, competency requirements to care for a specific patient, levels ofexperience and education of staff, and licensure of staff. Nurse leaders and man-agers must know their staff well and understand the scope of practice for eachtype of staff. Appropriate staffing and skill mix can have a positive impact on patient care (Dabney and Kalisch, 2015). RN Scope of Practice The RN scope of practice is fairly consistent nationally and globally and includesall aspects of the nursing process. RNs are licensed personnel who have completeda specific course of study at a state-approved school of nursing and passed theNCLEX-RN examination (National Council of State Boards of Nursing [NCSBN],2016). The responsibilities of RNs include assessment, diagnosis, planning, inter-vention, and evaluation. Patient teaching, discharge planning, evaluating and mon-itoring changes in patient status, and complex patient care that requires specialChapter 11 Organizing Patient Care 243 BOX 11-1BOX 11-1 Calculation of Nursing Hours per Patient Day (NHPPD)Calculation of Nursing Hours per Patient Day (NHPPD) (Nursing staff hours available) / (24-hour census) = NHPPD Example: In a 30-bed medical unit, census at midnight is 28.

Aim The aim of this study was to extend previous research by exploring patient reportsof missed nursing care and determine the relationship between patient reports ofmissed care and unit staffing levels. Methods A secondary analysis was used to determine the relationship between patient reports of missed care and the level of nurse staffing. The sample included 729 patients on 20 units in two hospitals. Missed nursing care was measuredusing the MISSCARE Survey-Patient. This tool consists of 13 questions organ-ized according to three subscales: communication, timeliness, and basic care.Nurse staffing was measured using RNHPPD (total productive RN hours per patient day), NHPPD (total productive nursing hours per patient day, includingRNs, LPNs/LVNs, and UAPs), and RN skill mix (the ratio of RNs to other nursing personnel). Key Findings No significant correlations were found between basic care and the nurse staffingvariables or between communication and the nurse staffing variables. Significantrelationships were found between missed timeliness of care and the three nursestaffing variables. The higher the RNHPPD, the timelier the provision of nursing care (P = 0.0002). The higher the NHPPD, the timelier the provision of nursing care (P = 0.015). The higher the RN skill mix, the timelier the provision of nursing care (P = 0.0004). In addition, RN skill mix was found to be a predictor of missed timeliness. The investigators pointed out that RNs may be more focused than other nursingpersonnel on ensuring that patient needs are responded to quickly, and they suggested that there may also be a lack of teamwork, by citing that low levels of teamwork have been found to be predictive of missed care. Although staffingvariables were not associated with communication and basic care in this study,the researchers emphasized that this finding is in contrast to finding of otherstudies. Implications for Nurse Leaders and Managers First and foremost, nurse leaders and managers must be cognizant of missed nurs-ing care. The findings of this study provide evidence of the positive impact of ap-propriate staffing on patient care. Nurse leaders and managers must advocate forpatients and be able to articulate to upper management that evidence shows thatincreased staffing, especially RN staffing, results in patient reports of more rapidresponses to their needs and, in turn, can positively impact patient satisfaction. EXPLORING THE EVIDENCE 11-13021_Ch11_229-253 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 244knowledge and judgment are also within the scope of practice of the RN. In addi- tion, RNs are responsible for assigning, supervising, and delegating appropriatelyto other team members to ensure that safe and quality care is delivered. Teachingthe theory and practice of nursing and participating in the development of health-care policies, procedures, and systems are also components of the RN's scope ofpractice (NCSBN, 2012). LPN/LVN Scope of Practice The LPN/LVN scope of practice includes physical care, taking vital signs, and ad-ministering medication, and it can vary significantly from state to state. LPN/LVNsare licensed personnel who have completed a specific course of study of a state-approved practical or vocational nursing program and passed the NCLEX-PN ex-amination (NCSBN, 2016). Regardless of their scope of practice, LPN/LVNs alwayswork under the direction or supervision of an RN, advanced practice RN, physi-cian, or other health-care provider designated by the state (NCSBN, 2012). Nurseleaders and managers must be cognizant of their state's nurse practice act to ensurethat LPN/LVNs are being assigned within their scope of practice. UAP Scope of Practice The UAP scope of practice typically includes activities of daily living, hygiene, andphysical care. However, the scope of practice for UAPs also varies from state tostate. UAPs are unlicensed personnel specifically trained to function in an assistiverole to RNs and may or may not be regulated by a state board of nursing. UPAsperform tasks as delegated by an RN (NCSBN, 2016). Staffing Approaches Research on safe staffing has revealed that it is effective in reducing adverse events,improves quality of care received, and improves nurse satisfaction, which in turnreduces costly nurse turnover. Determining adequate staffing levels requires nurseleaders and managers to recognize unique patient care settings, patient flow (admissions, discharges, and transfers), patient acuity, and the skills, education,and experience of the available nursing staff. However, there is not a perfect methodfor determining staffing. The AONE (2010) calls for nurse leaders and managers todevelop core staffing models that support patient-centered care and allow staffmembers to function at the peak of their licensure. Nurse leaders and managerscan use a variety of approaches to safe staffing, such as patient classification sys-tems, ANA's Principles for Nurse Staffing , the Agency for Healthcare and Research Quality nurse staffing model, and National Database of Nursing Quality Indicatorsstaffing benchmarks.Chapter 11 Organizing Patient Care 245 LEARNING ACTIVITY 11-1 Scopes of Practice Review your state nurse practice act (visit www.ncsbn. org/npa.htm). Compare the specific scopes of practice for RNs, LPNs/LVNs, and UAPs. 3021_Ch11_229-253 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 245Patient Classification Systems A patient classification system (PCS) predicts patient needs and requirements for nurs- ing care. A PCS groups patients according to acuity of illness and complexity of nursing activities necessary to care for the patients. Typically, patient acuity dataare collected every shift by nursing staff and are analyzed to project nursing staffneeds for the next shift. The advantage of using a PCS is that it is an objective approach to determining staffing based on patient care needs: a sicker patient requires more nursing care and therefore would have a higher acuity level. How-ever, there are numerous issues regarding use of PCSs, including lack of standard-ization, lack of credibility among nurse leaders and managers, and no considerationof patient flow (Hertel, 2012). Nurse leaders in informatics are investigating the use of information technology with PCSs to assist in effective nurse staffing (Harper, 2012). Information technol-ogy can potentially decrease costs, improve staffing efficiency, and improve qualityof care and patient safety. Information technology incorporated with a meaningfulmodel for nurse staffing, such as the Clinical Demand Index, \"can make staffingbased on evidence a reality\" (Harper, 2012, p. 267). Although there are commercial PCSs for purchase, many health-care organi- zations design their own. Regardless of the type of PCS used, it must be reliableand valid. American Association of Nurses Principles for Safe Staffing The ANA document Principles for Nurse Staffing was initially developed in 1999 to \"focus the health care industry on how complex nurse staffing decisions are andto identify major elements to consider when evaluating safety and appropriatenessof nurse staffing\" (ANA, 2012 p. 3). The ANA (2012) defines appropriate nursestaffing as \"a match of registered nurse expertise with the needs of the recipient of nursing care services in the context of the practice setting and situation\" (p. 6).Evidence demonstrates that nursing care directly impacts the quality of servicesand that, when RN staffing is adequate, adverse events decrease and, overall, patient outcomes improve (ANA, 2012). The evidence linking adequate nursestaffing to improved patient outcomes has continued to grow. After systematically assessing the original principles for scientific relevance, applicability, and gaps, the ANA published the second edition of ANA's Principles for Nurse Staffing in 2012. The updated principles are focused on addressing the complexities of nurse staffing decisions and apply to all types of nurse staffingin all types of health-care settings. To take into account the various health-caresettings and situations, the updated principles are organized into the followingfive categories (ANA, 2012, pp. 7-11): 1.The characteristics and considerations of the health-care consumer: Staffing decisions are based on the number and needs of the individual, families, and populations served. 2.The characteristics and considerations of RNs and other interprofessional team membersand staff: The needs of the populations served determine the appropriate clinical competencies required of the RNs practicing in that clinical setting.246 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS 3021_Ch11_229-253 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 2463.The context of the entire organization in which the nursing services are delivered: Health-care organizations must create work environments that value RNs andother staff as strategic assets and budgeted positions are filled in a timelymanner. 4.The overall practice environment that influences delivery of care: Staffing is a structure and process that affects patient outcomes as well as nursing outcomes. Health-care organizations must recognize that nurse staffing is integral to a culture of safety. 5.The evaluation of staffing plans: Health-care organizations must use flexible staffing plans that demonstrate logical methods for determining staffing levels and skillmix based on evaluation data. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Nurse Staffing Model The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) nurse staffing modelevolved from meta-analysis conducted by investigators (Kane et al., 2007) undercontract with the AHRQ. After reviewing 28 research studies related to the effectsof nurse staffing on patient safety, the investigators found a positive correlationbetween adequate RN staffing levels and patient outcomes. Based on the results,these investigators developed a conceptual framework to guide nurse staffing thatconsiders the complexity of hospital care today and accounts for the following:patient, hospital, and organizational factors; nurse characteristics; nurse staffing;medical care; and the impact of these factors on patient outcomes and length ofstay (Kane et al., 2007). They also identified two key consequences of safe nursestaffing\u2014patient outcomes and nurse outcomes\u2014while recognizing that althoughpatient outcomes are nurses' ultimate concern, nurse outcomes can positively ornegatively affect patient outcomes and therefore must also be considered. TheAHRQ model (Fig. 11-1) provides nurse leaders and managers a realistic frame-work for staffing because it reflects the complex relationships among patient fac-tors, nurse staffing, nurse characteristics, hospital and organizational factors, andpatient outcomes. National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators Staffing Benchmarks In 1994, the ANA launched the Safety and Quality Initiative to explore the empiricallink between nursing care and patient outcomes (Montalvo, 2007). The ANA's find-ings highlighted strong links between nursing actions and patient outcomes. Thefocus of the initiative since the 1990s has been educating RNs about quality mea -surement, informing the public and policy makers about safe and quality healthcare, and investigating research methods and data sources to evaluate safety andquality patient care empirically (Montalvo, 2007). In 1999, the ANA joined with the University of Kansas School of Nursing and the Midwestern Research Institute to form the National Database of NursingQuality Indicators (NDNQI), and together they work to establish definitions,data collection, and benchmarking criteria. The mission of the NDNQI is to aidRNs \"in patient safety and quality improvement efforts by providing research-based national comparative data on nursing care and the relationship to patientChapter 11 Organizing Patient Care 247 3021_Ch11_229-253 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 247outcomes\" (Montalvo, 2007, addition, the NDNQI facilitates the stan- dardization of information on nursing quality and patient outcomes across thenation. Hospitals report unit-level data quarterly, and feedback reports are pro-vided to hospitals quarterly. The ANA developed nursing-sensitive quality indicators to measure patient outcomes most affected by nursing care (Montalvo, 2007):\"Nursing sensitive indicators reflect the structure, process, and outcomes of nurs-ing care. Structure is indicated by the supply, skill level, and education of nursingstaff. Process measures aspects of nursing care such as assessment, interventions,and RN job satisfaction. Patient outcomes are those that improve if there is agreater quantity or quality of nursing care (e.g., pressure ulcers, falls, and IV in-filtrations)\" (NDNQI, 2010, p. 3). In-depth discussion of nursing-sensitive qualityindicators and how they relate to quality care is presented in Chapter 7. The NDNQI measures characteristics of the nursing workforce related to quality of patient care, including staffing levels and turnover as well as other nursing-sensitive quality indicators. Although all the current nursing-sensitive quality in-dicators reflect safe staffing in some way, several indicators such as skill mix andNHPPD, which are discussed earlier in this chapter, are directly correlated tostaffing (NDNQI, 2010). The national database provides benchmark data for specific unit types that nurse leaders and managers can use to establish safe staffing plans. In 2014, Press GaneyAssociates, Inc. acquired the NDNQI from the ANA. The NDNQI data programmeasures nursing quality, improves nurse satisfaction, strengthens the nursingwork environment, assesses staffing levels, and improves reimbursement undercurrent pay-for-performance policies. Currently, the NDNQI collects and evaluates248 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS \u0081 Age \u0081 \u0081 Skill mix\u0081 Nurse staffing ratioNurse Staffing \u0081 Mortality\u0081 Adverse events\u0081 Patient satisfaction\u0081 Nurse quality outcomes\u0081 Length of stayPatient Factors Length of StayMedical care \u0081 Satisfaction\u0081 rate\u0081 Burnout rate Nurse Characteristics Nurse Outcomes Figure 11-1 Conceptual framework of nurse staffing and patient outcomes.

Developing and Implementing a Staffing Plan Nurse leaders and managers must ensure that appropriate staff members are sched-uled during each shift each day to provide safe and quality nursing care. A staffing plan describes the number and type of nursing staff needed from shift to shift and from day to day. When considering a staffing plan, nurse leaders and managersmust consider regulatory requirements (federal and state legislation, as well as stateboards of nursing). Accrediting agencies such as The Joint Commission also haveguidelines for effective staffing that must be considered. Additionally, nurse leadersand managers are bound by standards of practice such as those outlined in theANA Nursing Administration: Scope and Standards of Practice (2015c). The ANA (2015a) supports legislation to empower nurses to establish safe staffing levels that are unit specific and to account for changes in patient needs, patient flow(admissions, discharges, and transfers during a shift), staff experience level, staffeducation, unit layout, and available resources. As of 2015, seven states had sometype of legislation related to staffing that resembled the ANA recommendations(ANA, 2015b). The Registered Nurse Safe Staffing Act of 2015 (H.R. 2083/S. 1132)was introduced in Congress by an RN to empower RNs to drive staffing decisionsin hospitals to improve quality of care (ANA, 2015b). Other requirements of the Registered Nurse Safe Staffing Act include the following (ANA, 2015b): Hospitals that participate in Medicare reimbursement must establish a committee,composed of at least 55% direct-care nurses, to create nurse staffing plans that arespecific to each unit. The practice of \"floating\" nurses would be limited to ensure that RNs are notforced to work on units if they lack the education and experience in that specialty. Hospitals would be held accountable for safe nurse staffing by being requiredto ensure that RNs are not forced to work without orientation in units wherethey are not trained or experienced; develop procedures for receiving and in-vestigating complaints; consider RN educational preparation, professional certifications, and level of clinical experience; consider the number and capacityof available health-care personnel, geography of a unit, and available technol-ogy; and consider the intensity, complexity, and stability of patients. In addition,the act includes whistleblower protections and requires public reporting ofstaffing information. Nursing leaders and managers can also look to Benner's novice-to-expert model for a framework for developing and implementing staffing plans. Benner's modeltakes into account the tasks, competencies, and outcomes RNs can be expected toacquire based on five stages of experience (Benner, 1984): Stage I\u2014Novice: A novice is a nurse with no experience of situations in which they are expected to perform. Typically, the novice performs tasks from a rule-based perspective or a checklist approach. Nursing students are in the noviceChapter 11 Organizing Patient Care 249 3021_Ch11_229-253 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 249stage, as are nurses who change their clinical area of work to one in which they do not have previous experience (pp. 20-21). Stage II\u2014Advanced beginner: An advanced beginner can demonstrate marginally acceptable performance of tasks with enough experience to grasp some mean-ingful aspects of the situation at hand. Newly graduated nurses are consideredadvanced beginners and need support in the clinical setting (pp. 22-25). Stage III\u2014Competent: Competent nurses have 2 or 3 years of experience. The competent nurse can establish a plan of care and can determine which aspectsof a situation are important and which aspects are not priorities (pp. 25-27). Stage IV\u2014Proficient: Proficient nurses have 3 or more years of experience. They perceive the situation as a whole rather than as aspects and use maxims, or subtlechanges nurses recognize based on previous experience, as guides (pp. 27-31). Stage V\u2014Expert: Expert nurses operate from a deep understanding of the total situation and do not rely on analytical principles to understand the situation(pp. 31-36). They use intuitive and reflective thinking in their practice. Nurses transition from one stage to the next as they gain more knowledge and experience, and their performance becomes fluid and flexible depending on the situation. Understanding what stage each member of the nursing staff is in can helpnurse leaders and managers when developing effective staffing plans. Novice andadvanced beginner nurses need more direction and coaching than competent and proficient nurses, whereas expert nurses are able to function independentlyand are great resources for the less experienced nurses. Benner's model has been used over the years as a framework for teaching, as clinical ladders in health-care organizations, and for developing staffing plans. Themodel warns against using nurses interchangeably; rather, nurse leaders and man-agers should use staffing strategies that foster staffing stability and maximize expertclinical performance. Further, staffing should be such that expert nurses are avail-able to advanced beginner nurses, competent nurses, and proficient nurses at alltimes for consultation to ensure safe and quality care. Monitoring Productivity Staffing plans can have a positive or negative effect on staff morale, turnover, and retention, as well as the quality of nursing care delivered. Nurse leaders and managers can find themselves constantly balancing the care requirements ofthe p atients with the needs of nursing staff and the economic and productivity250 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS LEARNING ACTIVITY 11-2 Staffing Plans Determine how well your clinical setting staffs their unit: Do they use a patient classification system? What type do they use? Do they staff strictly by nurse-to-patient ratios? What is the typical nurse-to-patient ratio? What is the typical staff mix on the unit? Does this unit use LPNs/LVNs?3021_Ch11_229-253 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 250expectations of the organization (Roussel, 2013). Productivity is related to the effi- ciency of a nursing staff in delivering nursing care and the effectiveness of the care delivered relative to its quality and appropriateness (Roussel, 2013). These factorscan be very difficult to quantify because they depend on the educational level,competence, and critical thinking skills of the nursing staff. Productivity can bemeasured using the following formula: Required staff hours / Provided staff hours \u00d7100 = Productivity Nurse leaders and managers have a major challenge today balancing safe and quality care with meeting organizational productivity requirements. They mustmonitor staff productivity and evaluate staffing effectiveness on a regular basis.Productivity can be improved by decreasing provided staff hours and maintainingor increasing required staff hours. Productivity is discussed further in Chapter 16. Evaluating Staffing Effectiveness Ensuring positive patient outcomes requires nurse leaders and managers to eval-uate staffing effectiveness daily, weekly, and monthly. When evaluating staffing effectiveness, nurse leaders and managers must consider many of the elements already discussed, including patient acuity trends, staffing overtime, staffing mix,patient satisfaction, and patient outcomes. Variance reports are used to evaluatestaffing effectiveness by comparing planned staffing with budgeted staffing. Thesereports assist in identifying trends in key areas. All nurses have a role in evaluating staffing effectiveness. Nurses are responsible for reporting to nurse leaders and managers any concerns they have related to safestaffing. In return, nurse leaders and managers have a responsibility to investigatestaffing concerns identified by nursing staff and to act immediately on any issuesthat could negatively impact patient or nurse outcomes. SUMMARY Organizing patient care to deliver safe and quality nursing care is a critical rolefor all nurse leaders and managers, whether organizing care for an individual patient in the hospital or at his or her home or whether organizing care for a groupof patients in a community setting such as a skilled nursing facility. Nurse leadersand managers must anticipate patient volume, complexity of patient care needed,admissions, discharges, and transfers when establishing staffing plans to providesafe and quality nursing.

Murray, PhD, RN, CNE KEY TERMS Accountability AssignmentAuthorityDelegateDelegationDelegatorMindful communicationNursing judgmentOverdelegationPrioritizationResponsibilitySupervisionUnderdelegationLEARNING OUTCOMES Describe how the concepts of accountability, assignment, authority, prioritization, responsibility, and supervision pertain to delegation. Outline what can and cannot be delegated and who can and cannot delegate. Describe the five rights of delegation. Explain the four steps of the delegation decision-making process. Identify potential barriers to effective delegation. Describe the nurse leader and manager's role in effective delegation. Nurses at all levels and in all settings are required to assign and delegate tasks to and supervise other health-care workers. To do so effectively, nurses must develop skills in delegation, prioritization, and oversight of nursing care (American Association of Colleges of Nursing [AACN], 2008). Florence Nightingale first talkedabout delegation in 1860: But again, to look to all these things yourself does not mean to do them yourself ... But can you not insure that it is done when not done by yourself? Can you insure that it is not undone whenyour back is turned? ... The former only implies that just what you can do with your own handsis done. The latter that what ought to be done is always done (Nightingale, 1860, p. 29). Effective delegation is considered a core skill for professional nursing practice globally (American Nurses Association [ANA] and the National Council of State Boards of Nursing [NCSBN], 2006; International Council of Nurses [ICN], 2012).The ICN (2008) maintains that nurses are responsible for the delegation of nursing3021_Ch12_254-270 16/01/17 10:35 AM Page 254Chapter 12 Delegating Effectively 255 care and supervision of assistive personnel. The ANA recognizes delegation as an important skill for nurses to deliver safe and effective care: The nurse \"delegatesaccording to the health, safety, and welfare of the healthcare consumer and consid-ering the circumstance, person, task, direction or communication, supervision, eval-uation, as well as the state nurse practice act regulations, institution, and regulatoryentities while maintaining accountability for care\" (ANA, 2015a, p. 61). Moreover,the ANA's Code of Ethics for Nurses with Interpretive Statements states that \"nurses are accountable and responsible for the assignment or delegation of nursing activ-ities. Such assignment or delegation must be consistent with state practice acts, organizational policy, and nursing standards of practice\" (ANA, 2015b, p. 17). Delegation is essential to effective leadership and management as well as man- agerial productivity. As a management principle, delegation is necessary to obtain-ing desired outcomes through the work of nursing staff (NCSBN, 1997). Nurseleaders and managers must delegate many routine tasks to allow themselves timeto handle more complex activities that require higher level of expertise. In this chapter, the key principles of delegation are outlined, including what can be delegated and by whom. Next, the five rights of delegation are covered, followedby a breakdown of the delegation process. Knowledge, skills, and attitudes related to the following core competencies are in- cluded in this chapter: patient-centered care, teamwork and collaboration, and safety. KEY PRINCIPLES OF DELEGATION Delegation requires problem-solving skills, critical thinking skills, and clinical judg-ment. Development of delegation skills begins early in a nurse's academic career,but proficiency is achieved with education and experience. Indeed, delegation canbe difficult for novice nurses because they are still acquiring foundational knowl-edge and skills, have limited experience, and are in the early stages of developingcritical thinking skills (Duffy & McCoy, 2014). Delegation is defined as \"the act of transferring to a competent individual the authority to perform a selected nursingtask in a selected situation, the process for doing the work\" (NCSBN, 2005, p. 1).Additionally, the individual delegating the task retains accountability for the out-come (ANA, 2015a, p. 86). Nurses delegate tasks based on patient needs, potentialfor harm, stability of a patient's condition, complexity of the task, and predictabilityof the outcome. Also taken into consideration are the qualifications and skill levelof the person to whom the task is delegated (ANA, 2012). Nurses must be familiarwith their state nurse practice acts to ensure that they delegate within legal para -meters. Most state nurse practice acts prohibit nurses from delegating certain as-pects of the nursing process to licensed practical nurses (LPNs), licensed vocationalnurses (LVNs), and unlicensed assistive personnel (UAPs). In addition, an individ-ual cannot delegate a task that is not in his or her own scope of practice. Delegationis a management principle used to obtain the desired outcomes through the workof others (NCSBN, 1997). When delegation is used effectively, nurse leaders andmanagers can expand access to nursing care, promote safe and quality nursing care,and facilitate effective use of health-care resources. In the delegation process, the delegator is the registered nurse (RN) who is delegating the task. The delegator must have the appropriate qualifications, 3021_Ch12_254-270 16/01/17 10:35 AM Page 255education, and authority to delegate as determined by the state nurse practice act, other regulatory agencies, and organization policy and procedures. The delegate (also referred to as delegatee) is the person to whom the task is being del- egated, and he or she must also have the appropriate education and skills to carryout the activity. RNs may delegate nursing activities to other RNs, LPNs or LVNs, and UAPs. Accountability is defined by the NCSBN (1995) as \"being responsible and answerable for actions or inactions of self or others in the context of delegation\"(p. 2). In the process of delegation, an RN must comply with the state nurse prac-tice act or regulating bodies and is accountable for the quality of nursing careprovided. Nurses have a professional accountability and obligation not to abusetrust and to be able to justify professional actions (Royal College of Nursing,2015). Nurses are accountable for the decision to delegate and for the tasks delegated to others. In addition, \"nurses are accountable for their professionalpractice and image as well as the outcomes of their own and delegated nursingcare\" (AACN, 2008, p. 9). The health-care organization is also accountable fordelegation. Organizational accountability involves providing sufficient resourcesfor nurses to provide nursing care effectively and safely, including the following(ANA and NCSBN, 2006, p. 3): Providing sufficient staffing with an appropriate staff mix Documenting competencies for all staff providing direct patient care and ensuringthat RNs have access to the information Developing organizational policies on delegation with active participation of allnurses and acknowledging that delegation is a professional right and responsibility Nurse leaders and managers are accountable for \"establishing systems to assess, monitor, verify, communicate ongoing competence requirements in areasrelated to delegation\" (ANA and NCSBN, 2006, p. 2). They set the expectationsfor appropriate delegation and ensure that RNs, LPNs or LVNs, and UAPs areaware of individual roles (Duffy & McCoy, 2014). Additionally, nurse leadersand managers are accountable for providing a safe environment that supportsthe delegation process (ANA, 2015a). An RN has legitimate authority by virtue of his or her professional licensure to delegate specific tasks to other RNs or to a competent LPN, LVN, or UAP . In thedelegation process, nurses have authority to make assessments, diagnose, plannurse care, implement and evaluate nursing care, and exercise nursing judgment. Authority is a \"legal source of power; the right to act or command the actions of others and to have them followed\" (Porter-O'Grady & Malloch, 2013, p. 432). Anurse must have the authority or the right to act or command the actions of othersto carry out patient care activities safely. Authority is based on the state nurse prac-tice act and should also be reflected in a nurse's job description. The organizationmust give the nurse the authority to direct the work of others. Nurse leaders andmanagers have the authority to determine how staff resources will be distributedon the unit based on patient needs. Responsibility is the obligation one has to accomplish work. Additionally, respon- sibility involves the individual's obligation to perform competently at the person'slevel of education. In the delegation process, the nurse is responsible to assess the256 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS 3021_Ch12_254-270 16/01/17 10:35 AM Page 256situation, determine the competence of the delegate and appropriateness of dele- gation, supervise the delegate, evaluate the performance of the delegate, and man-age the results (Porter-O'Grady & Malloch, 2013). Delegates accept responsibilitywhen they agree to perform tasks delegated to them (ANA, 2012; Weydt, 2010).The delegate is responsible for his or her own actions and for accepting only tasksfor which he or she is qualified and providing feedback to the delegator as directed(Porter-O'Grady & Malloch, 2013). Supervision is provision of guidance or direction, oversight, evaluation, and follow-up (ANA and NCSBN, 2006, p. 1). The nurse supervises the activities del-egated by monitoring the delegate's performance of the task or function and ensuring compliance with standards of practice and policies and procedures. Organizational policies and procedures must be in place to support the nurse del-egating a task. In the event the activity is being done inappropriately, there mustbe policy in place to allow the nurse to assess the situation and take back controlof the task if necessary (ANA and NCSBN, 2006). Nurses engaged in \"supervisionof patient care should not be construed as managerial supervisors on behalf ofthe employer under federal labor laws\" (ANA and NCSBN, 2006, p. 1). Assignment describes the distribution of work that each staff member is responsible for during a given time period (ANA and NCSBN, 2006; Duffy & McCoy, 2014).When making an assignment, a nurse designates an individual to be responsible forspecific patients or selected responsibilities the individual is already authorized totake on through the nurse practice act (ANA and NCSBN, 2006; Porter-O'Grady & Malloch, 2013). During the assignment process, a transfer of responsibility andaccountability for the activity occur. The nurse assigning tasks must ensure that theactivity is within the individual's scope of practice. For example, the charge nurseof a unit typically makes the assignment of patient care for nurses on the shift. Thecharge nurse is accountable for his or her decisions related to the assignments buttransfers the accountability for care to the assigned nurses. Prioritization is another important principle of delegation. Although nurses are accustomed to prioritizing nursing care, delegation also requires effective prioritiza-tion. Prioritization is deciding which patient needs or problems require immediate action and which are not urgent and can be addressed at a later time. What Can and Cannot Be Delegated Many state nurse practice acts, regulatory agency guidelines, and institutional poli-cies specify nursing activities that may be delegated. Delegated tasks may involvemonitoring patients, collecting specimens, reporting, providing care, and docu-menting data. The UAP may take vital signs, measure intake and output, and reportthe information to the nurse. The nurse interprets the reported information as partof the assessment and then makes clinical judgments and uses the data to establisha plan of care. Tasks that should not be delegated include aspects of the nursing process (e.g., performing an assessment, formulating a nursing diagnosis, developing andupdating a plan of care for a patient, and evaluating the patient's progress towardachieving goals), as well as communicating with health-care providers, imple-menting orders from health-care providers, providing teaching to patient and/orChapter 12 Delegating Effectively 257 3021_Ch12_254-270 16/01/17 10:35 AM Page 257family, evaluating patient (ANA, 2015a; Anderson, Twibell, & Siela, 2006; Duffy & McCoy, 2014). Table 12-1 displays role-specific nursing activities for professional nurses, LPNs or LVNs, and UAPs. In general, any nurs-ing activity that requires specialized nursing knowledge or nursing judgmentcannot be delegated. Nursing judgment is defined as the educated, informed, and experienced process that a nurse uses to form an opinion and reach a clinical decision based on the analysis of available information (NCSBN, 2005). Further,nursing judgment includes conscious decision making and intuition. Who Can and Cannot Delegate As mentioned earlier, RNs may delegate to other RNs, LPNs or LVNs, and UAPs.In addition, LPNs or LVNs may delegate to a UAP if directed to do so by an RN.An LPN or LVN cannot assign or delegate to an RN. LPNs or LVNs can perform tasks that UAPs are not qualified to do. State nurse practice acts dictate the scope of practice for LPNs or LVNs, although the scopeof practice varies from state to state. Often the role of the LPN or LVN can beconfusing for new nurses or those who have not worked with them before, soall nurses must be knowledgeable about the nurse practice act in their state.Monitoring patients' health status and providing basic nursing care under the258 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS Table 12-1 Specific Nursing Activities of Registered Nurses, Licensed Practical Nurses or Licensed Vocational Nurses, and Unlicensed Assistive Personnel LPNs, licensed practical nurses; LVNs, or LVNs UAPs Under the direction of the RN, can do the following: Assisting a patient with activities of daily living Assisting a patient withhygiene Bed making Assisting with ambula-tion, positioning, andtransferring Dressing Feeding of patients without swallowing precautions Collecting specimens Collecting patient data(e.g., vital signs, weights,and intake and output)and reporting to the RNUnder the direction of RNs, can do all activities that can be done by UAPs plus: Care for stable patients with predictable outcomes Collection of patient data and reportingto RNs Updating of initial RN assessment Implementation of patient care Reinforcement of patient education Basic dressing changes Medication administration (excludingintravenous medications in somestates) Administration of enteral feedings Monitoring of intravenous infusions,blood transfusions, and intravenoussitesCan do all activities that can be done by LPNs or LVNs and UAPs plus: Activities requiring specialized nursing knowledge or nursing judgment Care for unstable patients with unpredictable outcomes All aspects of the nursing process: assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, and evaluation Administration of all medications Initiation and maintenance of intravenous fluids Administration of intravenous medications Blood transfusions Complex dressing changes Sterile procedures3021_Ch12_254-270 16/01/17 10:35 AM Page 258direction of an RN comprise the duties of LPNs or LVNs. Common tasks LPNs or LVNs can perform include those of the UAP in addition to updating initialassessments performed by the RN, reinforcing teaching, and monitoring patientstatus. UAPs are health-care workers who provide low-risk care that does not require nursing knowledge or nursing judgment. UAPs typically assist patients with activities of daily living, such as bed making, bathing, and assisting with dressing,and they provide basic care under the supervision of an RN. Usually, UAPs do nothold a license; however, they may be certified. THE FIVE RIGHTS OF DELEGATION Nurse leaders and managers must work collaboratively with staff nurses to maintainthe integrity of patient care (NCSBN, 1997). The five rights of delegation can be usedas a guide for nurses to clarify critical elements of the delegation decision-makingprocess: The right task is assigned to the right person under the right circumstances with the RN providing the right direction or communication and the right supervision . The five rights of delegation delineate accountability for nurses at all levels. Right Task In the nurse's best judgment, the right task is one that can be safely delegated to aspecific delegate for a specific patient. Appropriate activities for consideration fordelegation include those that (NCSBN, 1997): Frequently occur in the daily care of patients Are within the scope of practice of the LPN or LVN Do not require the UAP to exercise nursing judgment Do not require application of the nursing process Do not have risks that are predictable or beyond minimal Use a standard and unchanging procedure Nurse leaders and managers are responsible for ensuring that appropriate activities for consideration in the delegation process are identified in the LPN orLVN and UAP job description. In addition, nurse leaders and managers must describe the expectations and limitations of activities in organizational policies andprocedures and in standards of practice (NCSBN, 1997).Chapter 12 Delegating Effectively 259 LEARNING ACTIVITY 12-1 Review your state nurse practice act, and determine the following: Does it address delegation? Does it describe specific tasks that can or cannot be delegated? Does it describe who can and cannot delegate? 3021_Ch12_254-270 16/01/17 10:35 AM Page 259Right Circumstances When delegating, the nurse must consider the patient setting, available resources, and other relevant factors. Effective delegation requires the nurse to assess thestatus of patients, analyze the data, and identify patient-specific goals and nurs-ing care needs. In addition, the nurse must match the complexity of the task withthe competency level of the delegate and the amount of supervision needed.Nurse leaders and managers are responsible for assessing the needs of the patientpopulation on the unit or department and identifying collective nursing careneeds, priorities, and resources. Further, ensuring appropriate staffing and skillmix, as well as providing sufficient equipment and supplies, is critical for effectivedelegation. Right Person It is important for nurses to know the competency levels of those on the patientcare team to delegate on an individual and patient-specific basis. Nurse leadersand managers must establish organizational standards consistent with state lawsto ensure educational requirements and competencies of RNs, LPN or LVNs, andUAPs. Nurse leaders and managers should ensure that competence standards related to delegation are integrated into organizational policies and should assessRN, LPN or LVN, and UAP performance routinely. Performance evaluations shouldbe based on standards, and nurse leaders must initiate steps to remedy any failureto meet standards (NCSBN, 1997). Further, it is inappropriate for nurse leaders andmanagers to require nurses to delegate when, in the nurse's professional judgment,delegation is unsafe (NCSBN, 1995, p. 2). Right Direction or Communication Communication is critical to effective delegation. The nurse must provide a clear,concise description of the task, including its objective, limits, and expectations(NCSBN, 1995). Communication between the delegator and the delegate is essentialto safe patient care. Situation-specific communication includes the following(NCSBN, 1997, p. 24): Specific data to be collected and method and timelines for reporting Specific activities to be performed and any patient-specific instruction and limitations The expected result or potential complications and timelines for communicatingsuch information Nurse leaders and managers are responsible for communicating acceptable activities, competencies, and qualifications of all staff members through standardsof practice, role descriptions, and policies and procedures (NCSBN, 1997). Further,nurse leaders and managers must facilitate open communication with all staffmembers and encourage them to express concerns or refuse an assignment, withoutfear of reprisal, if they believe that they do not possess the required skills neededto perform the task safely (ANA, 2015a). 260 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS 3021_Ch12_254-270 16/01/17 10:35 AM Page 260Right Supervision or Evaluation The nurse provides feedback to the delegate as well as appropriate monitoring, evaluation, and intervention as needed. The nurse may supervise the activity orassign supervision to another licensed nurse. The nurse must provide specific di-rections and clear expectations of how the task is to be performed; in addition, thenurse should monitor the performance, obtain and provide feedback, intervene ifneeded, and ensure proper documentation (NCSBN, 1997). Finally, the nurse mustevaluate the entire delegation process and provide feedback to all involved, includ-ing the patient. Nurse leaders and managers are responsible for ensuring that ad-equate human resources are available to provide for sufficient supervision. Nurseleaders and managers also must evaluate the outcomes of the patient populationand use information to develop quality improvement programs and risk manage-ment plans (NCSBN, 1997). THE DELEGATION PROCESS Whatever the task that is delegated, decisions must be made with the goal of deliv-ering safe and quality patient care. As mentioned earlier, the nurse must assess theknowledge, skill, and experience of the delegate, as well as the following (Snyder,Medina, Bell, & Wavra, 2004, p. 10): Potential for harm: The nurse must determine how much risk the activity can cause the individual patient. Complexity of the task: The more complex the task, the less desirable it is to delegate. Only an RN should perform complex tasks. Amount of problem solving and innovation needed: Activities that require special attention, adaptation, or an innovated approach should not be delegated. Unpredictability of outcome: It is not advisable to delegate an activity if the patient's response is unknown or unpredictable. Level of patient interaction: The nurse should avoid delegating activities that may interfere with the nurse's developing a trusting relationship with the patient. Delegation is a complex but necessary process requiring skill in clinical judgment to accomplish safe and effective nursing care in a timely manner. The delegationprocess includes assessment and planning, communication, surveillance and super-vision, and evaluation and feedback. Delegation is based on patient needs and available resources. During the assess- ment and planning steps of the delegation process, the nurse plans for care andspecifies the knowledge and skills required to accomplish the task (ANA andNCSBN, 2006). The nurse determines whether there are any cultural modificationsneeded, whether the patient's condition is stable and predictable, and whether theenvironment in which care will be provided is stable (Duffy & McCoy, 2014). Next,the nurse develops a plan of care with the patient and his or her family. If the nursedetermines that patient needs will be met without jeopardizing safety, then thenurse will proceed to the next step. Clear directions must be given to the delegate, including unique patient infor- mation and expectations regarding what to do, what to report, and when to ask forChapter 12 Delegating Effectively 261 3021_Ch12_254-270 16/01/17 10:35 AM Page 261assistance (ANA and NCSBN, 2006; NCSBN, 2005). Communication must be a two- way process, with the nurse assessing the delegate's understanding of expectationsand providing clarification if needed. Communication should be mindful (Anthony& Vidal, 2010). Mindful communication is an active process in which those involved are focused on attending to, responding to, and perceiving information. In mindfulcommunication, information is continually analyzed and categorized, thus allow-ing for dynamic information processing. The communication process is discussedin depth in Chapter 6. Surveillance and supervision of delegation are related to the nurse's responsi- bility for patient care and include determining the level of supervision required forthe specific situation. Surveillance is the process of observing and staying attunedto the patient's status and staff performance and, if necessary, following up on anyproblems that arise or a changing situation. The nurse must supervise the delegateby monitoring the task and ensuring compliance with standards of practice andpolicies and procedures (ANA and NCSBN, 2006; NCSBN, 2005). Finally, evaluation and feedback are used to assess the effectiveness of the delegation and the outcome and to determine whether there is a need to modifythe plan of care. The nurse evaluates the patient's response to the delegatedtask, including feedback from the patient and/or family during this step. Eval-uation is an important step in the process that is sometimes left out. The nurseshould be prepared to provide feedback to the delegate regarding whether thecare provided was performed correctly, whether the desired patient outcomewas achieved, and any areas for improvement (NCSBN, 2005). Evaluationshould be continuous during the delegation process. When evaluating and pro-viding feedback, the nurse must consider accepting variations in the style inwhich tasks are performed as long as standards of care are met and patient out-comes are appropriate. The nurse monitors the delegation process, providesfeedback to the delegate, obtains feedback from the delegate, considers the ini-tial assessment, modifies the plan of care if necessary, and evaluates the patientoutcome. The four steps of the delegation process are illustrated by the NCSBN Decision Tree for Delegation to Nursing Assistive Personnel in Figure 12-1.262 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS LEARNING ACTIVITY 12-2 Using the Delegation Decision Tree Use the NCSBN decision tree (see Fig. 12-1) and Table 12-1 and determine whether you as the RN would delegate the following tasks to a UAP: Feeding a patient with difficulty swallowing Measuring intake and output Ambulating a patient for the first time after abdominal surgery Evaluating a patient's pain level after receiving pain medication Emptying a urinary drainage bag Checking nasogastric tube placement Monitoring intravenous fluids Administering enteral feedings3021_Ch12_254-270 16/01/17 10:35 AM Page 262Chapter 12 Delegating Effectively 263 Are there laws and rules in place that support the delegation?If not in the licensed nurse's scope of practice, then cannot delegate to the nursing assistive personnel (NAP).

Continued3021_Ch12_254-270 16/01/17 10:35 AM Page 263264 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS Step Two - Communication Communication must be a two-way process. The nurse: \u0081 Assesses the assistant's understanding of - How the task is to be accomplished - When and what information is to be reported, including\u0081 Expected observations to report and record\u0081 Specic client concerns that would require prompt reporting \u0081 Individualizes for the nursing assistive personnel and client situation \u0081 Addresses any unique client requirements and characteristics, and expectations \u0081 Assesses the assistant's understanding of expectations, providing clarication if needed \u0081 Communicates his or her willingness and availability to guide and support assistant \u0081 Ensures appropriate accountability by verifying that the receiving person accepts the delegation and accompanying responsibilityThe nursing assistive personnel: \u0081 Asks questions regarding the delegation and seek clarication of expectations if needed \u0081 Informs the nurse if the assistant has not done a task/function/activity before, or has only done infrequently \u0081 Asks for additional training or supervision \u0081 Afrms understanding of expectations\u0081 Determines the communication method between the nurse and the assistive personnel \u0081 Communicates his or her willingness and availability to guide and support assistant \u0081 Determines the communication and plan of action in emergency situationsDocumentation: Timely, complete, and accurate documentation of provided care\u0081 Facilitates communication with other members of the health- care team \u0081 Records the nursing care provided Step Three - Surveillance and Supervision The purpose of surveillance and monitoring is related to nurse's responsibility for client care within the context of a client population. The nurse supervises the delegation by monitoring the performance of the task or function and assures compli-ance with standards of practice, policies, and procedures. Frequency, level, and nature of monitoring vary with needs of client and experience of assistant. The nurse considers the: \u0081 Client's health care status and stability of condition \u0081 Predictability of responses and risks \u0081 Setting where care occurs\u0081 Availability of resources and support infrastructure \u0081 Complexity of the task being performedThe nurse determines: \u0081 The frequency of onsite supervision and assessment based on:- Needs of the client- Complexity of the delegated function/task/activity - Proximity of nurse's locationThe nurse is responsible for: \u0081 Timely intervening and follow-up on problems and concerns. Examples of the need for intervening include:- Alertness to subtle signs and symptoms (which allows nurse and assistant to be proactive, before a client's condition deteriorates signicantly) - Awareness of assistant's difculties in completing delegated activities - Providing adequate follow-up to problems and/or changing situations is a critical aspect of delegation Step Four - Evaluation and Feedback Evaluation is often the forgotten step in delegation. In considering the effectiveness of delegation, the nurse addresses the following questions: \u0081 Was the delegation successful? - Was the task/function/activity performed correctly?- Was the client's desired and/or expected outcome achieved?- Was the outcome optimal, satisfactory, or unsatisfactory?- Was communication timely and effective?- What went well; what was challenging?- Were there any problems or concerns; if so, how were they addressed? \u0081 Is there a better way to meet the client need?\u0081 Is there a need to adjust the overall plan of care, or should this approach be continued?\u0081 Were there any \"learning moments\" for the assistant and/or the nurse?\u0081 Was appropriate feedback provided to the assistant regarding the performance of the delegation?\u0081 Was the assistant acknowledged for accomplishing the task/activity/function? Figure 12-1\u2014cont'd3021_Ch12_254-270 16/01/17 10:35 AM Page 264BARRIERS TO EFFECIVE DELEGATION Delegation can be very challenging for both the delegator and the delegate, and there are numerous reasons that delegation can be unsuccessful. Unfortunately, ineffective delegation can jeopardize the provision of safe and quality patient carein a timely manner and can result in missed care or omitted care (e.g., ambulatingand turning patients, providing hygiene, documenting input and output, patientteaching, discharge planning) (Kalisch, 2006). Nurse leaders and managers mustimplement strategies to diminish factors contributing to poor delegation (Gravlin& Bittner, 2010). Recognizing potential barriers is the first step in overcoming them(Snyder et al., 2004). Major barriers to effective delegation can be related to the delegator, the delegate, and leadership and management. There are times whendelegation can result in conflict between the delegator and the delegate. In a studyto understand the differences in the perceptions of delegation between nurses andUAPs, investigators found that when conflict occurred during the delegationprocess, nurses and UAPs had different perceptions of the cause of the conflict (Potter, Deshields, and Kuhrik, 2010).Chapter 12 Delegating Effectively 265 EXPLORING THE EVIDENCE 12-1 ContinuedGravlin G., & Bittner, N. (2010). Nurses' and nursing assistants' reports of missed care and delegation. Journal of Nursing Administration , 40(7/8), 329-335. Aim The aim of the study was to measure the reports of RNs and UAPs of missed nursingcare and reasons for missed care; identify factors related to successful delegation asreported by RNs and UAPs; and describe nurse managers' reports of missed care. Methods This study was a descriptive study using the MISSCARE Survey 2 and a delega-tion questionnaire. Surveys and questionnaires were distributed to 568 RNs and232 UAPs. In addition, a unit characteristics questionnaire was distributed to 16 nurse managers. RNs and UAPs were asked to rate factors that contributed to successful delegation and to rate their perceived effectiveness in the delegation process(e.g., assessment, planning, communication, supervision, and evaluation). RNswere also asked questions regarding delegation education, comfort level withdelegation, number of nursing administrators on a routine shift, and the value of a well-educated and experienced UAP to them in their daily practice. UAPs were asked to identify factors that contributed to successful delegation and report about the training they had related to delegation, as well as the numberof RNs delegating to them per shift. The nurse managers were given a questionnaire to collect data about the num- ber of beds on the unit, skill mix during each shift, the number of patients assignedeach shift to the UAP , and the number of RNs delegating each shift to the UAP . 3021_Ch12_254-270 16/01/17 10:35 AM Page 265Delegator-Related Barriers Nurses may not delegate because they are not team players, prefer to work alone, or believe they can perform certain tasks better than others. Insecurity, lack of experience, and poor organizational skills are other reasons nurses do not delegate.The nurse may experience fear when considering delegation (e.g., that it will resultin a negative outcome or that the safety of the patient could be jeopardized) (Snyderet al., 2004). Other nurses fear criticism from other nurses or delegates. Nurses may also delegate too many tasks to a delegate or delegate to only a few select delegates. Overdelegation occurs when the workload is more than the delegate can accomplish in the allotted time frame. In addition, overdelegation can overworksome delegates while leaving others with little to do. Nurses may overdelegatewhen they feel uncomfortable performing certain tasks, are unorganized, or are inexperienced with delegation. Nurse leaders and managers often overdelegate266 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS EXPLORING THE EVIDENCE 12- 1\u2014cont'd Key Findings The sample included 242 RNs (42.2% response) and 99 UAPs (42.6% response). In all, 100% of the nurse managers responded. Findings were as follows: 48.6% of the RNs and 59% of the UAPs reported never having formal educationrelated to delegation. 82% of the RNs indicated that they were comfortable with the delegation process. 83% of the RNs reported that they delegated to two UAPs per shift, whereasUAPs indicated they reported to three to four RNs per shift. An alarming finding was that 65% of the UAPs reported that they were assignedmore than 10 patients each shift. RNs and UAPs reported similar reasons for missed care. The three most commonreasons were: an unexpected increase in patient volume and/or acuity; inadequatenumber of UAPs; and heavy workflow (admissions and discharges). Both RNs and UAPs reported tension or communication breakdowns as reasonsfor missed care, and 69% of RNs indicated that the UAP did not communicatethat care was not done. 88% of the nurse managers indicated that their staff had reported missed care tothem, and 66.7% reported that occurrences of missed care were frequent. Implications for Nurse Leaders and Managers Ineffective delegation and missed care have major implications for patient safetyand quality care. Nurse leaders and managers must be notified of ineffective dele-gation or missed care episodes on the unit. In addition, nurse leaders and managersmust assess the work environment, care delivery methods, and teamwork on theunit to ensure that effective communication is being used among staff members andthat safe and effective care is being provided. To promote safe and effective care,nurse leaders and managers should consider including delegation education andeffective communication when orienting new RNs and UAPs.3021_Ch12_254-270 16/01/17 10:35 AM Page 266when they are unfamiliar with certain responsibilities, especially if staff members are comfortable with the task. In contrast, underdelegation is the failure to transfer authority for a task or the failure to provide clear direction to the delegate. Underdelegation occurs for a variety of rea-sons. Some nurses fear losing control or authority and recognition. In some cases,nurses underdelegate because of a lack of willingness to accept variations in the stylein which tasks are performed. Nurse leaders and managers may underdelegate because they feel insecure or are concerned that more experienced staff membersmay resent them. In addition, they may believe that they can accomplish the taskquicker or do not want to take the time to explain, observe, and evaluate the delegate(Duffy & McCoy, 2014; Porter-O'Grady & Malloch, 2013). Other reasons for under-delegation are fear of the task being done incorrectly or poorly and of depending onothers (Porter-O'Grady & Malloch, 2013). New nurses often underdelegate becausethey are inexperienced with using authority to delegate, fear being disliked, or fearmaking a mistake in the delegation decision-making process (Duffy & McCoy, 2014). Delegatee-Related Barriers The delegate must be reliable and willing to accept delegated tasks; in fact, somedelegates may refuse to accept a delegated task. Lack of confidence or fear of failureon the part of the delegate can impact the delegation process. The delegate maylack experience or confidence. Nurses should consider the following potential rea-sons for refusal and attempt to work with the delegate if possible (Porter-O'Grady& Malloch, 2013, p. 441): Lack of willingness to do the task Lack of skill or comfort with the skill required for the task Feeling overworked or perception of an unfair assignment Physical inability to do the work Leadership- and Management-Related Barriers Leadership and management at the organizational and unit level that do not pro-mote effective delegation can negatively impact patient outcomes. A lack of guide-lines that address who can delegate and what tasks can be delegated does notprovide support for effective delegation. There must be policies and procedures inplace that allow input from nurses and support delegation as a nurse's right andresponsibility. Policies should protect the nurses from inappropriate assignmentsand delegation of inappropriate nursing activities or responsibilities (ANA, 2015b). Job descriptions for RNs, LPNs or LVNs, and UAPs should address the delega- tion process to allow nurses to have the authority to delegate. The nurse's job description must reflect the nurse's authority, responsibility, and accountability fordelegation. The delegate's job description should indicate the type of nursing tasksand skills that he or she can take on. Nurses must also be knowledgeable about thedelegate's job description. Nurse leaders and managers are responsible for validat-ing delegate credentials and qualifications and keeping staff nurses informed. Lack of a supportive environment, poor staffing levels, lack of tolerance for mistakes, and the absence of processes for validation of competencies for delegationChapter 12 Delegating Effectively 267 3021_Ch12_254-270 16/01/17 10:35 AM Page 267268 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS Potter, P ., Deshields, T., & Kuhrik, M.

Aim The aim of this study was to understand RNs' and UAPs' perceptions of delegationpractices in delivery of oncology patient care. Methods This qualitative study used semistructured group interviews to explore the livedexperience of RNs and UAPs. Ten RNs and six UAPs were interviewed in separategroups and asked to describe their experiences with delegation on their nursingunits. The interviews were transcribed verbatim using thematic analysis. Key Findings Major themes in the delegation process emerged from each group. From the RNgroups, themes included the following: Conflict (age, role, work ethic, personality, and management) Communication Roles of RNs and UAPs Teamwork On the UAP side, themes included the following: Conflict (work ethic, role, and personality) Communication Teamwork Initiative Accountability Patient centeredness The participants described conflict as a central theme. Both groups suggested that when RNs delegate activities to UAPs, conflict often occurs, but the groupsperceived the cause of the conflict differently. RNs identified reluctance of someUAPs to accept delegation as the cause of conflict between the two groups. Incontrast, UAPs perceived the cause of conflict to be a breakdown in teamwork between the RN and the UAP . Implications for Nurse Leaders and Managers This study has important implications for patient safety. The clarity and quality of the delegation process influence patient outcomes. Nurse leaders and managersare responsible for ensuring that effective delegation occurs on the unit. They mustdevelop clear guidelines for delegation and educate staff in effective communica-tion and delegation processes. In addition, nurse leaders and managers must cre-ate a unit environment that fosters effective delegation and staff relationships andthat, in turn, can potentially reduce risks for missed care and adverse events.EXPLORING THE EVIDENCE 12-2 3021_Ch12_254-270 16/01/17 10:35 AM Page 268can pose major barriers to effective delegation. The quality of delegation practices on a unit can influence patient safety. Breaking Down Barriers Fostering trusting and respectful relationships among RNs, LPNs or LVNs, andUAPs is critical to effective delegation (Bittner & Gravlin, 2009). Establishing guide-lines, policies, and procedures to support the delegation process promotes delega-tion and offers guidance for nurses engaging in delegation. Including delegationin the job descriptions of all nursing personnel establishes the authority, accounta-bility, and responsibility for delegation. In addition, this allows nurse leaders andmanagers to hold all staff members accountable to principles related to delegationthat are addressed in the job description. Nurse leaders and managers can provideperiodic feedback related to the delegation process to RNS, LPNs or LVNs, andUAPs to promote the development of effective delegation skills. Nurse leaders and managers must focus efforts on creating a supportive environment that promotes effective communication and teamwork. Creating asupportive environment for delegation can facilitate patient care and reducerisks for adverse events and near misses (Potter et al., 2010). Nurse leaders andmanagers should create \"a culture of quality and safety that ensures attentionto detail and honest reporting of omissions of nursing care\" (Kalisch, 2006, p. 312). Nurse leaders and managers are accountable for compromised standardsof care resulting from poor delegation practices. Therefore, nurse leaders andmanagers must promote reporting missed care followed by root cause analysisto determine underlying causes of the problem and identify strategies to improve the delegation process. SUMMARY Delegation is a complex process in nursing practice that requires nursing knowl-edge, nursing judgment, and final accountability for patient care. Effective delega-tion requires all nurses as well as nurse leaders and managers to be knowledgeableabout the principles of delegation, the associated risks and benefits of delegation,and state regulations governing nursing practice. Effective delegation is critical tosafe and quality patient care because it frees the nurse to be able to do more special-ized tasks that involve making nursing judgments and coordinating patient care.Organizations must support nurse leaders and managers in the coordination, supervision, and delegation of care as needed. Effective leadership and managementat the organizational and unit or department level foster successful delegation.

Murray, PhD, RN, CNE KEY behaviorHealthy work environmentIncivilityLateral violenceNurse fatigueVertical violenceWorkplace safetyWorkplace violenceLEARNING OUTCOMES Discuss the elements of a healthy nursing work environment. Identify how nurse leaders and managers can create and sustain a healthy work environment. Describe how effective techniques for safe patient handling and movementimpact patient and nurse safety. Explore the association between nurse fatigue and patient safety. Describe types of workplace violence. The health-care work environment can impact nurses' overall outlook as well as their own safety and the ability to provide safe and quality nursing care to patients. Unhealthy work environments create stress among nurses and can contribute to adverse events. Work environments that are unhealthy also typically lack civility,respect, and courtesy; in turn, ineffective interpersonal relationships and workplaceviolence are often tolerated in such climates. In contrast, a healthy work environmentleads to work satisfaction, increased retention, effective organizational performance,and improved patient outcomes (Sherman & Pross, 2010). In addition, healthy workenvironments support meaningful work, joy in the workplace, and safer patient caredelivery (Lucian Leape Institute, 2013). A healthy work environment also enhancesnurse recruitment and retention and helps sustain an organization's financial viability. Nurse leaders and managers are responsible and accountable for creating and sustaining a safe and supportive work environment for their staff and patients.However, they face extraordinary challenges in creating a healthy work environmentbecause of the increasing demand for and decreasing supply of registered nurses,3021_Ch13_271-293 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 271272 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS reimbursement declines, and constrained resources (Schwarz & Bolton, 2012). To create and sustain a healthy work environment effectively, nurse leaders and man-agers \"must be skilled communicators, team builders, agents for positive change,committed to service, results oriented, and role models for collaborative practice\"(American Association of Critical-Care Nurses, 2014, p. 19). This chapter details theelements needed for a healthy work environment, illustrates common challenges,and identifies realistic strategies for nurse leaders and managers to use to create andsustain a healthy work environment. Knowledge, skills, and attitudes related to the following core competencies are in- cluded in this chapter: teamwork and collaboration, safety, and quality improvement. GUIDELINES FOR BUILDING A HEALTHY WORK ENVIRONMENT Over the years, nursing organizations have worked to identify elements and compe-tencies for a healthy work environment. A healthy work environment \"is one that is safe, empowering, and satisfying not merely the absence of real and perceived physical oremotional threats to health but a place of physical, mental, and social well-being, sup-porting optimal health and safety\" (American Nurses Association [ANA], 2016a). Ahealthy work environment supports excellent nursing care, creates a culture of phys-iological and psychological safety, and gives nurses the satisfaction of knowing thatthey are valued and their work is meaningful. The ANA has developed numerous ini-tiatives, position statements, and brochures focusing what is part of a healthy workenvironment (e.g., safe patient handling and mobility [SPHM] and healthy workinghours) and what is not (e.g., bullying, workplace violence, and nurse fatigue). In 2001,the ANA developed the Nurses' Bill of Rights to help nurses to improve their workenvironment and ensure their ability to provide safe, quality patient care (Wiseman,2001). The ANA (2016b) Bill of Rights outlines seven premises regarding necessaryworkplace expectations for sound professional nursing practice across the UnitedStates (Box 13-1). According to the document, nurses have the right to practice nursing BOX 13-1BOX 13-1 Nurses' Bill of RightsNurses' Bill of Rights From American Nurses Association (2016b), with permission.To maximize the contributions nurses make to society, it is necessary to protect the dignity and autonomy of nurses in the workplace. To that end, the followingrights must be afforded: 1.Nurses have the right to practice in a manner that fulfills their obligations to society and to those whoreceive nursing care. 2.Nurses have the right to practice in environmentsthat allow them to act in accordance with profes-sional standards and legally authorized scopes of practice. 3.Nurses have the right to a work environment that supports and facilitates ethical practice, inaccordance with the Code of Ethics for Nurses with Interpretive Statements. 4.Nurses have the right to advocate for themselvesand their patients freely and openly, without fear of retribution. 5.Nurses have the right to fair compensation for theirwork, consistent with their knowledge, experience,and professional responsibilities. 6.Nurses have the right to a work environment that is safe for themselves and for their patients. 7.Nurses have the right to negotiate the conditions of their employment, either as individuals or collectively, in all practice settings.3021_Ch13_271-293 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 272Chapter 13 Creating and Sustaining a Healthy Work Environment 273 in adherence to professional standards and ethical practice, advocate freely for them- selves and their patients, and practice in a safe work environment (ANA, 2016b). Although the Bill of Rights is a statement of professional rights and not a legal docu-ment, it can assist nurse leaders and managers in the development of organizationalpolicy and in advocating for healthy work environments for staff. In 2002, the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) identified eight hallmarks of a work environment that foster professional nursing practice.The AACN's (2016) hallmarks represent \"characteristics of the practice setting thatbest support professional nursing practice and allow baccalaureate and higher degree nurses to practice to their full potential.\" Intended to apply to all profes-sional practice settings and all types of professional nursing practice, the hallmarksare as follows (2016): 1.Manifest a philosophy of clinical care emphasizing quality, safety, interdisciplinary collaboration, continuity of care, and professional accountability. 2.Recognize the contributions of nurses' expertise on clinical care quality and patient outcomes. 3.Promote executive level nursing leadership. 4.Empower nurses' participation in clinical decision making and organization of clinical care systems. 5.Maintain clinical advancement programs based on education, certification, andadvanced preparation. 6.Demonstrate professional development support for nurses. 7.Create collaborative relationships among members of the health-care team. 8.Use technological advances in clinical care and information systems. Nurse leaders and managers in all practice settings can find these hallmarks useful. These elements are key in creating and sustaining a work environment that recognizes professional nurses for their knowledge and skills as well as ensuringretention of nurses (AACN, 2016). In 2005, the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses developed Standards for Establishing and Sustaining Healthy Work Environments to promote the creation of healthy work environments that support excellence in patient care wherever nursespractice. The organization identified six essential standards for establishing andsustaining a healthy work environment (American Association of Critical-CareNurses, 2016, p. 10): 1.Skilled communication: Nurses must be as proficient in communication skills as they are in clinical skills. 2.True collaboration: Nurses must be relentless in pursuing and fostering true collaboration. 3.Effective decision making: Nurses must be valued and committed partners in making policy, directing and evaluating clinical care, and leading organiza- tional operations. 4.Appropriate staffing: Staffing must ensure the effective match between patient needs and nurse competencies. 5.Meaningful recognition: Nurses must be recognized and must recognize others for the value each brings to the work of the organization.3021_Ch13_271-293 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 2736.Authentic leadership: Nurse leaders must fully embrace the imperative of a healthy work environment, authentically live it, and engage others in its achievement. These standards provide an \"evidence-based framework for organizations to create work environments that encourage nurses and their colleagues in every health-care profession to practice to their utmost potential, ensuring optimal patientoutcomes and professional fulfillment\" (p. 1). These standards also are interde-pendent (Fig. 13-1), and implementing them requires a commitment throughoutthe organization. In fact, all nurses have an ethical obligation to establish and sus-tain work environments conducive to providing safe, quality nursing care (ANA,2015a). Nurses must promote a work environment that demands \"respectful inter-actions among colleagues, mutual peer support, and open identification of difficultissues\" (ANA, 2015a, p. 24). Further, nurses should actively participate in estab-lishing, maintaining, and improving health-care environments and conditions of274 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS Figure 13-1 Interdependence of healthy work environment, clinical excellence, and optimal patient outcomes.

What resulted was a set of guidelines for nurse leadersand managers to use to decrease and control workplace violence in the hospital setting. The AONE Guiding Principles: Mitigating Violence in the Workplace (2014) offers eight principles to reduce lateral and patient and family violence systematically inthe workplace (para. 3): 1.That violence can and does happen anywhere is recognized. 2.Healthy work environments promote positive patient outcomes. 3.All aspects of violence (patient, family and lateral) must be addressed. 4.A multidisciplinary team, including patients and families, is required to address workplace violence. 5.Everyone in the organization is accountable for upholding foundational behaviorstandards, regardless of position or discipline. 6.When members of the health-care team identify an issue that contributes to violence in the workplace, they have an obligation to address it. 7.Intention, commitment, and collaboration of nurses with other health-care professionals at all levels are needed to create a culture shift. 8.Addressing workplace violence may increase the effectiveness of nursing practice and patient care. SAFETY ISSUES IN A HEALTH-CARE ENVIRONMENT An essential element of a healthy work environment is workplace safety , defined by the Lucian Leape Institute (2013) as \"a workplace free from risks of both phys-ical and psychological harm\" (p. 1). Yet, compared with other occupations,health-care workers have a high number of work-related injuries and illnesses(The Joint Commission [TJC], 2012). The prevalence of physiological injuriesamong health-care professionals is much higher than in other industries, andpsychological harm such as emotional abuse, bullying, and disrespectful treat-ment is also common (Lucian Leape Institute, 2013). In 2011, an ANA surveycompleted by 4,614 registered nurses regarding health and safety issues foundthat major safety concerns of nurses are disabling musculoskeletal injuries andthe acute and chronic effects of stress and overwork (L. C. Williams & AssociatesResearch Group, 2011). Although patient safety programs are prevalent throughout health-care systems, focus on nurse safety is not readily apparent: \"Workforce safety in healthcare organizations tends to be considered and managed in silos often unconnected tothe work of patient safety\" (Lucian Leape Institute, 2013, p. 11). However, patientsafety and nurse safety are linked. A systems approach that involves integration ofworkforce safety efforts with patient safety initiatives fosters a healthy work envi-ronment. If conditions exist in a health-care work environment that compromisethe physiological and psychological health of nurses, patient safety is jeopardized.Nurse leaders and managers are responsible for ensuring a safe work environment 3021_Ch13_271-293 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 275and addressing related problems, the most common being improper patient han- dling and mobility, nurse fatigue, and workplace violence. In fact, accrediting agen-cies and the Magnet recognition program include standards that address theseissues because they impact patient safety and nurse outcomes. Safe Patient Handling and Mobility Registered nurses risk musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) on a daily basis throughactivities such as standing for extended periods of time and moving equipment. Inthe 2011 ANA survey, 62% of nurses reported that developing an MSD was a topconcern, 56% indicated that they had experienced musculoskeletal pain that wasmade worse by their job, and 80% of the nurses surveyed who had pain from MSDs276 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS L.

Methods Data were collected through a Web-based survey. A URL link to the survey wassent out to 73,500 registered nurses in the United States in July 2011. Key Findings The major concerns identified by nurses were as follows: Implications for Nurse Leaders and Managers The findings of this study can help nurse leaders and managers as they assessthe workplace for factors that impact worker safety and health. The findings of this study are important to consider when creating and sustaining a healthywork environment.EXPLORING THE EVIDENCE 13-1 Concerns 2001 2011 52% 12 months3021_Ch13_271-293 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 276Chapter 13 Creating and Sustaining a Healthy Work Environment 277 continued working despite experiencing frequent pain (ANA, 2013). The most com- mon tasks that can lead to MSDs include lifting, transferring, and repositioning patients (ANA, 2013). In the daily handling and movement of patients, nurses jeop-ardize their own physical health and the physical health and well-being of theirpatients (Ogg, 2011). Nursing experts contend \"there's no such thing as safe lifting\"when nurses use their bodies as lifting mechanisms (Fitzpatrick, 2014, p. 1). Further,they contend that \"old school teachings about body mechanics have been proveninvalid,\" and nurses as well as nurse leaders and managers must change the tech-niques used to move, transfer, and reposition patients. There are significant clinical consequences of improper and/or awkward patient handling and mobility techniques that can negatively impact the quality of care, patient safety, and patient comfort. The two principle methods for lifting and movingpatients are the two-person lift and the hook-and-toss methods (TJC, 2012). Use ofproper body mechanics and training in lifting techniques have been the sole methodsin the United States used to prevent or minimize injuries related to moving patients,yet these methods alone continuously fail to reduce injuries during the delivery ofpatient care (Krill, Raven, & Staffileno, 2012), and they are still prevalent in nursingcare today (ANA, 2013; TJC, 2012). Use of body mechanics is simply insufficient toprotect nurses from the extremely heavy weight, uncomfortable positioning, and rep-etition associated with manual patient handling. Commonly, manual lifting resultsin microinjuries to the spine that may not be noticeable to the nurse immediately but,when cumulative, can result in a debilitating injury (ANA, 2013). Many barriers to eliminating the risk of harm exist. Nurses cite specifically the lack of a \"no-lift\" policy, the lack of adequate lifting equipment, and inadequatespace on patient care units as major barriers to the development safe patient han-dling measures. Lack of equipment, decreased staffing levels, and the architectureof the environment are the three main modifiable attributes to improving the envi-ronment of care and increasing the safety of patient handling and mobility (Krill,Staffileno, & Raven, 2012). Furthermore, nurses frequently do not report their injuries, most commonly because nurses believe that they would be letting their patients down, they con-sider injuries to be part of the profession (e.g., many nurses believe that back painis expected), and they think that making a report would be pointless (Callison & Nussbaum, 2012). To effect change and to ensure safer patient handling and mobility, nurse leaders and managers must implement Safe Patient Handling and Mobility (SPHM) programsand establish policies to prevent nurses and patient injuries across the care continuum.They must also gain the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to best create an environmentthat focuses on minimizing risk of harm to the workforce and patients alike. A helpful resource for managers and leaders is the set of interprofessional national standards for SPHM developed by the ANA (2013). The SPHM standardsoutline the roles of nurse leaders and managers as well as staff and encompassthe following (ANA, 2013): A culture of safety A formal and sustainable SPHM program throughout the organization An ergonomic-specific approach3021_Ch13_271-293 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 277Inclusion of SPHM technology An effective system of education, training, and maintaining competence Patient-centered assessments and plans of care adapted to meet individual patient needs Reasonable accommodations and postinjury return to work for staff memberswho have been injured A comprehensive evaluation system to evaluate SPHM program status The ANA supports the adoption of \"no-lift\" policies and the elimination of manual handling nationwide (ANA, 2008). However, the Occupational Safety andHealth Administration (OSHA) cannot enforce such policies; rather, it can only require employers to evaluate work environment safety. Currently, 11 states (California, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Rhode Island, Texas, and Washington) have enacted safe patient handling laws. Additionally, Hawaii has a resolution in place callingfor support of safe handling and mobility policies. Of these states, 10 require a comprehensive program in health-care facilities, including an established policy, guidelines for securing appropriate equipment and training, collectionof data, and evaluation (ANA, 2016c). In December 2015, legislation on SPHMwas introduced in the House of Representatives (H.R. 4266) and the Senate (S. 2408). The implementation of SPHM programs involving the use of patient handling equipment and devices, education, ergonomic assessment protocols, no-lift policies,and patient lift teams has facilitated the reduction in incidences of workplace injuries. These programs are believed to improve the quality of care for patients, reduce work-related health-care costs, and improve the safety of patients (Krill,Staffileno, & Raven, 2012). Further, they can increase worker satisfaction and in-crease health-care savings as a result of reductions in worker's compensation, patientfalls and pressure ulcers, and employee turnover (ANA, 2013). Nurse Fatigue Occupations such as nursing that have extended shifts of more than 12.5 hours, rotating shifts, and higher workloads are associated with worker fatigue and sleepdeprivation, both of which can lead to injuries, accidents, and performance errors(TJC, 2012). Nurse fatigue is the \"impaired function resulting from physical labor or mental exertion\" (ANA, 2014, p. 8). Fatigue can be one of three types: physiological,or reduced physical capacity; objective, or reduced productivity; and subjective, a278 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS LEARNING ACTIVITY 13-1 Comparing Policies and Procedures With Safe Patient Handling and Mobility Standards Review the policies and procedures at your current clinical site. Is there a specific policy on safe patient handling and mobility? Compare the policy with the SPHM standards.3021_Ch13_271-293 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 278Chapter 13 Creating and Sustaining a Healthy Work Environment 279 weary or unmotivated feeling (ANA, 2014). Findings from a landmark study (Rogers, Hwang, Scott, Aiken, & Dindes, 2004) indicated that the number of errors and nearmisses registered nurses make are directly related to the number of hours worked.In addition, nurses who work more than 12.5 hours in 24 hours are three times morelikely to make errors than are nurses who work less than 12.5 hours. The Institute ofMedicine (Page, 2004) found that prolonged work hours resulted in negative workerperformance, including slow reaction times, lapses of attention to detail, errors ofomission, and compromised problem-solving. In light of this evidence, the Instituteof Medicine recommended that \"state regulatory bodies should prohibit nursing stafffrom providing patient care in any combination of scheduled shifts, mandatory over-time, or voluntary overtime in excess of 12 hours in any given 24-hour period and inexcess of 60 hours per 7-day period\" (Page, 2004, p. 236). Another common situation that contributes to nurse fatigue and that can jeop- ardize patient safety is the lack of rest breaks during working hours. Nurses arenotorious for not taking meal breaks or rest breaks during a shift. If and when anurse takes a break, he or she will often not completely relinquish patient careresponsibilities (TJC, 2012). Although this practice is not safe for patients ornurses, rest breaks are not mandated by federal regulations, and fewer than 25 states currently have legislation enforcing workers' legal rights to breaks(Witkoski & Dickson, 2010). Even though evidence supports recommendationsthat nurses take uninterrupted breaks, self-care is often sacrificed for patient care.Unfortunately, this is the current cultural attitude, and it puts both patient safetyand nurse safety at risk. There is a well-documented relationship between nurse fatigue and nurse errors that can compromise patient care and safety (ANA, 2014; Bae & Fabry,2014; Rogers et al., 2004; Witkoski & Dickson, 2010). It is critical to safety andquality care that nurses carefully consider their level of fatigue when acceptinga patient assignment that extends beyond the regularly scheduled workday orwork week (ANA, 2006). In fact, nurses have an ethical obligation to practice ina manner that maintains patient and personal safety (ANA, 2014). As a patientadvocate, nurses must be \"alert to and take appropriate action regarding any instances of incompetent, unethical, illegal, or impaired practice by any memberof the healthcare team or the healthcare system or any action on the part of othersthat places the rights or best interests of the patient in jeopardy\" (ANA, 2015a,p. 12). Working when fatigued can place the nurse's safety, as well as the patient's, in jeopardy. Fatigue can result in irritability, reduced motivation, inability to stay focused, diminished reaction time (TJC, 2012), increased risk for errors, decreased memory,increased risk-taking behavior, impaired mood, and ineffective communicationskills. It can also negatively impact the health and well-being of nurses (ANA,2014). In December 2011, TJC issued a Sentinel Event Alert linking health-care worker fatigue and adverse events to high levels of worker fatigue, reduced pro-ductivity, compromised patient safety, and increased risk of personal safety andwell-being (TJC, 2011, para. 1). Nurses at all levels are obligated to seek balance between their personal and pro- fessional lives; fatigue can negatively impact both. Nurses have a responsibility toarrive at work well rested, alert, and prepared to deliver safe, quality nursing care3021_Ch13_271-293 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 279(ANA, 2015a, 2015b). In addition, nurse leaders and managers have an ethical responsibility to foster this balance among their staff members. Nurses and nurse leaders and managers have a joint responsibility in reducing the risk of fatigue and sleepiness in the workplace. Nurses at all levels should adoptevidence-based fatigue countermeasures and personal strategies to reduce the riskof fatigue (ANA, 2014, p. 4). Some examples include sleeping the recommended 7 to 9 hours within a 24-hour period, taking brief rest periods before work shifts,improving overall health, adopting stress management strategies, taking scheduledmeal and rest breaks when working, and taking naps in accordance with organiza-tional policies (ANA, 2014, p. 4). Nurse leaders and managers are responsible for creating and sustaining a healthy work environment that promotes healthy work schedules. The ANA (2014)offers the following evidence-based strategies that nurse leaders and managers canuse to prevent nurse fatigue (pp. 6-7): Limiting shifts nurses work to no more than 12 hours in 24 hours and no morethan 40 hours per week Conducting regular audits to ensure that safe schedule policies are followed Ensuring that nurses are able to take scheduled meal and rest breaks Establishing policies to allow nurses to take naps during long shifts Supporting nurses' decisions to decline working extra shifts or overtime withoutpenalizing them Nurse leaders and managers must be change agents to develop policies that sup- port evidence-based recommendations for dealing with nurse fatigue. They mustmonitor overtime to ensure that staff members are not working fatigued, developflexible work schedules, and implement work schedules with minimal rotation ofshifts (TJC, 2012). Nurse leaders and managers are \"responsible for establishing aculture of safety; a healthy work environment; and for implementing evidenced-based policies, procedures, and strategies that promote health work schedules andthat improve alertness\" (ANA, 2014, p.5). Workplace Violence The health-care industry has a long history of tolerating disrespectful behaviorsthat erode confidence and self-esteem. Many of these behaviors fall under the umbrella of workplace violence and create a culture of fear, diminish staff morale, impact patient safety and job satisfaction, and drain joy and meaning from work(Lucian Leape Institute, 2013). Further, workplace violence in health-care settingsresults in disrupted work relationships, miscommunication, and an unhealthy workenvironment, and it is linked to negative patient and nurse outcomes. A review of the literature suggests that workplace violence is a global problem and is not unique to any one specific nursing specialty (Hockley, 2014). The UnitedStates is believed to have more workplace violence than any other industrializednation in the world, and the incidence of violence is higher for health-care workersthan for those in other occupations (Nelson, 2014).

S., & Redeker, N. S. (2013). Effects of napping on sleepiness and sleep- related performance deficits in night-shift workers: A systematic review. Biological Research for Nursing, 16(2), 134-142. Aim The aim of this study was to critically review and synthesize the literature for evidence of improvements in sleepiness and sleep-related performancedeficits following planned naps taken during work-shift hours by night-shiftworkers. Methods The investigators conducted searches in CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, Health and Safety Science Abstracts, MEDLINE, and PsychoINFO by using the keyword nap along with performance , fatigue , psychomotor vigilance, sleepiness, shift work , employment , and alert . A total of 2,775 abstracts were retrieved and reviewed for eligibility to include in the systematic review. Original research reports of experimental and quasi-experimental studies included the following: 1. A specifically assigned nap ( 2 hours) taken during a night shift or simulated night shift of 7 to 13 hours in duration and beginning at 5:00 p.m. or later and ending between 6:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. 2. Comparison with no-nap conditions3. The measurement of subjective sleepiness or fatigue or objective measures of sleep-related performance deficits including vigilance, cognitive functioning,logical reasoning performance, work tasks and driving, workload, and memory recall Thirteen studies that met the criteria were analyzed by the investigators. Key Findings The findings of this systematic review indicated that planned naps during anight shift or simulated night shift reduced sleepiness and improved sleep-related performance deficits in some populations and in some settings. The investigators suggested that naps are safe to use in the workplace, and they recommended further research to document the effect of naps on work-specificoutcomes (i.e., decision making, errors), as well as larger, randomized controltrials. Implications for Nurse Leaders and Managers This study supports the need for scheduled rest periods for all workers. The findings provide data suggesting that actual scheduled naps can be beneficial fornight-shift workers. Nurse leaders and managers can explore the findings fromthis study and others to identify data to support implementation of rest and napperiods in the workplace. EXPLORING THE EVIDENCE 13-23021_Ch13_271-293 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 281the International Council of Nurses, and Public Services International identified workplace violence as an important universal public health issue (Child & Mentes,2010; Magnavita & Heponiemi, 2011). A meta-analysis of research studies con-ducted in 38 countries revealed that approximately 30% of nurses worldwide arephysically assaulted and injured, and approximately 60% of nurses have experi-enced nonphysical violence (Spector, Zhou, & Che, 2014). The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) uses the following classifications for workplace violence (NIOSH, 2013): Type 1: The perpetrator has criminal intent and no legitimate relationship withthe organization or its employees. Type 2: The perpetrator is the customer or client, patient, family member, or visitorand has a relationship with the organization and becomes violent while receivingservices. This type of workplace violence is very common in health care. Type 3: The perpetrator is another coworker or commits worker-on-worker violence. This type of workplace violence includes incivility and bullying andis very common in health care. Type 4: The perpetrator has a relationship with a worker but no relationship withthe organization. This type of workplace violence involves personal relationships(e.g., an employee is followed to work by his or her spouse with the intent tothreaten or harm the employee). Nonphysical workplace violence includes emotional abuse, intimidation, put- downs, harassment, humiliation, and humor at the expense of a colleague (LucianLeape Institute, 2013). Bullying and incivility are two examples of the most preva-lent nonphysical workplace violence. Bullying is defined as \"repeated, unwanted actions intended to humiliate, offend, and cause distress in recipients\" (ANA, 2015a,p. 3). Bullying harms, undermines, and degrades others and includes hostile remarks, verbal attacks, threats, taunts, intimidation, withholding of support (ANA,2015a; McNamara, 2012; Rocker, 2012). Incivility is defined as \"disrespect, rudeness, and general disdain for others\" (Rocker, 2012, p. 2) that often results in psychologicaland physiological distress for those involved (Griffin & Clark, 2014). Incivility canalso include gossiping, spreading rumors about others, and refusing to assist acoworker. It typically constitutes a continuum of disruptive behavior (Fig. 13-2), with non-verbal behavior (eye rolling) on one end of the spectrum and physical violenceand tragedy on the other (Clark, Barbosa-Leiker, Gill, & Nguyen, 2015). Types of Violence There are several different types of workplace violence: nurse-to-nurse violence, third-party violence, nurse-to-patient violence, patient-to-nurse violence, organizational violence, external violence, sexual harassment, and mass trauma or natural disasters. Nurse-to-Nurse Violence Nurse-to-nurse violence, or physical or nonphysical violence between or amongnurses who have a workplace relationship, has many other names, such as lateral violence, horizontal violence, and vertical violence. Although these terms are usedinterchangeably, each has a slightly different meaning, although all can be considered282 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS 3021_Ch13_271-293 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 282Chapter 13 Creating and Sustaining a Healthy Work Environment 283 forms of bullying and incivility. Nurse-to-nurse violence falls under the NIOSH type 3 classification and is very common in health care. Lateral violence (also known as horizontal violence) consists of bullying or incivility between two or more nursesat the same level. For example, Susan, a registered nurse, is at the end of her shiftand is told that Barb will be her relief. Susan says to several other nurses, \"I hate togive report to Barb. She asks so many annoying questions.\" When Barb arrives forreport, Susan rudely says, \"Don't ask me any questions. I'm tired and want to gohome!\" The nurses who overhear all giggle. In this situation, Susan was gossipingabout Barb and also spoke to her rudely. Both are examples of lateral violence. In contrast, vertical violence consists of bullying or incivility between a nurse subordinate and someone at a higher level (e.g., a manager or charge nurse). Forexample, in a staff meeting, the nurse leader and manager is explaining to everyoneabout an upcoming change related to documentation. Several staff nurses ask aboutwho made the decision to make the change. The nurse leader and manager rollsher eyes, sighs loudly, and says, \"It was my decision, and I do not appreciate youquestioning me!\" In this situation, the nurse leader and manager was disrespectfulto the nurses in the meeting. In addition, the nurse leader and manager made animportant decision without discussing it with the staff members, those who are impacted most by the decision. When staff members are not treated with respect,they will not feel valued or appreciated. Repeated experiences such as this can leadto avoidance, communication blocks, and distractions, which ultimately impact patient safety (Lucian Leape Institute, 2013). Violence among nurses negatively affects the environment of care; roughly 60% of new graduate nurses leave their first nursing position within a year as a result ofDistracting, annoying, or irritating behaviorsAggressive, threatening, or violent behaviors Higher Level of IncivilityLow er Level of Incivility of incivility. From : Clark, C. M., Barbosa-Leiker, C., Gill, L., & Nguyen, D. (2015). Revision and psychometric testing of the incivility in nursing education (INE) survey: Introducing the INE-R. Journal of Nursing Education, 54 (6), 306-315. Reprinted with permission.3021_Ch13_271-293 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 283experiencing workplace violence (Embree & White, 2010). Nurse-to-nurse violence results in a negative community, emotional and physical aftermath, undesirable effects on patient care, and injured associations among coworkers. Nurses must keepin mind that they are called to create \"an ethical environment and culture of civilityand kindness, treating colleagues, coworkers, employees, students, and others withdignity and respect\" (ANA, 2015a, p. 4). Third-Party Violence Third-party violence refers to violence that is witnessed directly or indirectly by others.This often occurs when another witnesses nurse-to-nurse violence. The person whoobserves the violence, the third party, can experience the same harm as the victim ofthe violence. When a nurse observes another nurse being rude or disrespectful to acoworker, he or she can experience the same physiological and/or psychological effects as the victim of the actual violence. Research shows that third-party violencejeopardizes the confidence and security of the individual witness, so the perpetratoris actually inflicting harm on secondary victims (Hockley, 2014). Nurse-to-Patient Violence Nurse-to-patient violence occurs when nurses are violent toward those in their pro-fessional care, with a resulting violation of the nurses' code of ethics (Hockley, 2014).The most blatant example of this type of violence is a nurse hitting a patient. Otherexamples can be using restraints without an order and refusing to administer painmedication in a timely manner. Often this type of violence involves nurses violatingprofessional boundaries (i.e., asking a patient on a date). Nurses must recognize andmaintain boundaries that establish appropriate limits on the nurse-patient relation-ship. If professional boundaries are jeopardized, nurses have an ethical responsibilityto seek assistance and/or remove himself or herself from the situation (ANA, 2015a). Patient-to-Nurse Violence Patient-to-nurse violence involves a patient or family member being violent towarda nurse and falls under the NIOSH type 2 category. A patient hitting or biting a nurseis an example of this type of violence. A family member yelling at a nurse is anotherexample. Factors such as acute disease states, alcohol or drug intoxication, self-harmingbehavior, or a present exacerbation of a psychiatric disease are major contributorsto this type of workplace violence. Intensified states of emotion in patients or theirfamilies (e.g., nervousness, distress, despair, sorrow, irritation, or loss of control) arealso considered contributing factors to the incidence of workplace violence. Typi-cally, male patients or family members are more likely to execute both physical violence and verbal violence toward nurses who are women (Hockley, 2014). Inci-dences of assault against male nurses are more likely to occur in a psychiatric setting,whereas female nurses are more likely to be attacked in other specialty areas, withthe highest occurrence of violence taking place within the emergency departmentand psychiatric care environments (Child & Mentes, 2010). Organizational Violence Organizational violence affects the entire health-care organization and occurs as a result of a changing work environment (Hockley, 2014). For example, excessive 284 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS 3021_Ch13_271-293 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 284Chapter 13 Creating and Sustaining a Healthy Work Environment 285 workloads and unsafe working conditions can be considered forms of workplace violence (International Council of Nurses, 2006). Often, this type of violence tarnishesthe reputation of the organization as well as negatively impacts the employees. External Violence External violence is perpetrated by outside persons entering the workplace or whennurses are going to or from the workplace. This type of violence is type 1 accordingto NIOSH. It is usually random, and the perpetrators typically have criminal intent,such as rape, assault, armed robbery for drugs, or gang reprisals in emergency departments (Hockley, 2014). Sexual Harassment Sexual harassment has not received as much attention in recent nursing literature asworkplace violence, yet it is still prevalent. Sexual harassment includes \"inappropri-ately friendly behavior, sexually based verbal comments, vulgar, sexual language orinappropriate jokes or stories; unwelcome advances or requests for sexual favors;unwanted physical contact of a sexual nature; and sexual innuendo\" (McNamara,2012, p. 536). In a worldwide sample of 151,347 nurses, approximately one-fourth reported experiencing sexual harassment (Spector, Zhou, & Che, 2014). Sexual harassment in nursing occurs between nurses, between nurses and their supervisors, and between nurses and patients or family members. Many nursestake sexual harassment in stride, view it as part of the job, and decide not to reportit. Nurses and nursing students have a right to a workplace free of sexual harass-ment, and there are legal protections. It falls on nurse leaders and managers to beknowledgeable of federal and state legislation and to ensure that policies and pro-cedures are in place and maintained to protect staff from sexual harassment. Mass Trauma or Natural Disasters Workplace violence can also come in the form of mass trauma, such as biochemicalattacks or terrorist attacks, and natural disasters. Nurses' work during mass traumaor natural disasters can be extremely stressful and has the potential to cause serioushealth and mental health issues. However, little research has been done on this typeof violence (Hockley, 2014). LEARNING ACTIVITY 13-2 Reflecting on Workplace Violence During Recent Clinical Experiences Reflect on recent clinical experiences you have had and respond to the following: Have you observed any forms of workplace violence? What type? How did you feel? Were you the victim of workplace violence? What type? How did it make you feel? In the foregoing situations, did you confront the person? What was his or her response? In the foregoing situations, did you inform your clinical instructor or supervisor?What was his or her response? 3021_Ch13_271-293 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 285Contributing and Risk Factors Workplace violence continues to occur for three reasons: because it can, because it is modeled, and because it is left unchecked (McNamara, 2012). TJC (2012) suggeststhat disruptive behaviors that constitute workplace violence stem from individualand systemic factors. Some individuals who may lack interpersonal coping or conflict management skills can be more prone to disruptive behavior than others.Systemic factors include increased productivity demands, cost containment, andstress from fear of litigation. Inadequate information between organization leader-ship and staff and a lack of staff involvement in decisions can also contribute toworkplace violence (Longo, 2012). Another contributing factor is that nurses have been expected to cope with violence and accept abuse as part of the job. The pressure, be it spoken or unspo-ken, put on nurses to remain silent about workplace violence (e.g., more than 80% of incidents of workplace violence go unreported [American Association of Critical-Care Nurses, 2016]) hampers development and implementation of strate-gies to prevent it. In terms of which nurses are more at risk for workplace violence, risk factors involve age, gender, nursing experience, and present or previous history of involve-ment in an abusive relationship. Younger and less experienced nurses are morelikely to be victims of workplace violence. This reality may be attributed to the factthat older, more experienced nurses are in positions of management and experiencefewer patient and family interactions than younger novice nurses. Nurses in theemergency department also face an increased risk of violence, mostly related to the degree of accessibility (i.e., 24-hour access), amplified noise level, diminishedsecurity, elevated stress, and extended wait times (Child & Mentes, 2010). Consequences As a result of the underreporting of workplace violence incidents, there is debateon its prevalence. Research has shown that as few as 16% of nurses actually reportacts of workplace violence. Some nurses ignore workplace violence because of a lack of knowledge, whereas others fear repercussion if they report it (Kaplan,Mestel, & Feldman, 2010). Lack of time and inadequate administrative supporthave been identified as reasons that nurses fail to report events; 50% of nurses whoreported acts of violence felt as if the hospital administrators neglected to act on itand in some instances that management was punitive and insinuated that the staffinstigated the acts of violence (Chapman, Styles, Perry, & Combs, 2010). Nurseswho have been exposed to workplace violence perceive that organizational factorssuch as the environment of care as well as specific personal factors establish thefrequency and character of workplace violence (Chapman et al., 2010). However,the ANA (2015a) contends that any form of workplace violence puts the nursingprofession in jeopardy. Further, the ANA contends that those who witness work-place violence and do not acknowledge it, choose to ignore it, or fail to report it areactually perpetuating it (p. 2). There are many personal consequences of workplace violence, and they can be cumulative. Nurses who are victims of workplace violence can experience286 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS 3021_Ch13_271-293 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 286Chapter 13 Creating and Sustaining a Healthy Work Environment 287 physical and psychological problems as a result. Some physical effects include frequent headaches, gastrointestinal upset, weight loss or gain, sleep distur-bances, hypertension, and decreased energy (Longo, 2012). The psychologicaleffects may include stress, anxiety, nervousness, depression, frustration, mistrust,loss of self-esteem, burnout, emotional exhaustion, and fear (Longo, 2012).Health-care organizations can also be affected. Workplace violence can result in increased absenteeism, decreased worker satisfaction, and increased attrition.In addition, financial issues arise from increased use of sick pay and paying replacement workers (Longo, 2012). Environments of care in which nurses perceive that they have a lack of control, work under authoritarian managers, have limited resources, and feel persecutedwill lead to low morale and a toxic work environment, which fosters work-place violence. In contrast, a supportive environment with positive teamwork mitigates workplace violence (Embree & White, 2010; Hegney, Tuckett, Parker, & Eley, 2010). Strategies to Prevent Workplace Violence There are strategies nurse leaders and managers can use to prevent specific kinds ofworkplace violence, as well as in general. First, nurse leaders and managers must ex-amine the workplace for the presence of elements of an unhealthy environment suchas tolerance of incivility and bullying, high levels of stress and frustration amongstaff members, and a lack of trust among staff members and between staff and man-agement. Next, increasing awareness of workplace violence by providing informationat staff meetings can help prevent workplace violence. Nurse leaders and managerscan model and promote positive and professional behaviors to foster a healthy envi-ronment. In addition, nurse leaders and managers should support the developmentof organizational zero-tolerance workplace violence programs and policies. Methodsto prevent and overcome acts of lateral violence between nurses specifically shouldalso focus on strengthening communication among providers of care. A significantsource of stress for all nurses, especially a new nurse entering practice, lateral violenceamong nurses prohibits the delivery of quality health care. Nurse managers and lead-ers must ensure that communication is open, nonbiased, and respectful at all times.Nurses must be able to trust their colleagues and believe that they work within ateam. Once an incident of workplace violence occurs, nurse leaders and managersshould handle the situation by acknowledging the victim, confronting the perpetra-tor, and informing the perpetrator that such behavior will not be tolerated. In cases of patient-to-nurse violence, evidence suggests that implementing mea - sures to decrease the incidence of patient and family member attacks on health-careproviders has succeeded. First, violence prevention training for staff can curve theonset of an act of violence within the health-care environment and in fact decreasethe overall rates of violent incidents at the hands of patients and family members(Kling, Yassi, Smailes, Lovato, & Koehoorn, 2011). Second, the Alert System hasbeen implemented and found to facilitate a reduction of the prevalence of work-place violence. The system is a violence prevention intervention that includes a riskassessment form nurses can use to assess patients and identify those at an increasedrisk of violence on admission into an acute care setting; if a patient is identified as3021_Ch13_271-293 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 287such, the chart is then flagged for other providers of care so they are aware and can take precautions (e.g., wearing a personal alarm while caring for the patient, havingsecurity within the vicinity, not having objects that may potentially be used as aweapon close to the patient surroundings, and not caring for the patient withoutan additional staff member present) (Kling et al., 2011). To prevent workplace violence on a wider scale, an environment of care that fosters positive collegial relationships, facilitates open communication amonghealth-care providers, and adopts a zero-tolerance policy for abuse must be culti-vated. Nurse leaders and managers can enable an environment of safety that willminimize harm to patients and providers by embracing factors that create a cultureof safety, such as effective communication and an organizational reporting systemfor incidences of workplace violence, as well as valuing the influences that posi-tively impact the quality and safety of the delivery of patient care (Cronenwett et al., 2007). There are several resources that nurse leaders and managers can use to ensure a healthy, safe work environment. TJC (2012) set standards for addressing workplaceviolence or behaviors that undermine a culture of safety as well as addressing thefact that behavior that intimidates others can create an environment of hostility anddisrespect that affects morale, increases staff turnover, and leads to distractions anderrors, all of which compromise patient safety (McNamara, 2012). Nurse leadersand managers can also use the ANA Code of Ethics for Nurses with Interpretive State-ments (2015a), the ANA Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice (2015b), and the ANA position statement Incivility, Bullying, and Workplace Violence (2015c) as guide- lines to create and sustain a healthy work environment free of workplace violence.In addition, OSHA Guidelines for Preventing Workplace Violence for Healthcare and Social Services Workers (OSHA, 2015) is another valuable resource for nurse leaders and managers and provides violence prevention guidelines and effective ways to reduce risk of violence in the workplace. Nurse leaders and managers must also remember that creating and sustaining a healthy work environment is not their sole responsibility, but rather all nursesare accountable for a healthy work environment. Nurses have an individual re-sponsibility to focus on what they can do to affect a healthy work environment. Ina healthy work environment, professionals can use skilled communication toachieve positive outcomes. A model was developed for becoming a skilled com-municator and encouraging nurses to become aware of self-deception, reflective,authentic, mindful, and candid (Kupperschmidt, Kientz, Ward, & Reinholz, 2010).The five factors with operational definitions are displayed in Table 13-1. Nurse leaders and managers can also look to another model that identifies and addresses quality-of-life issues, including workplace violence, for nurses(Todaro-Franceschi, 2015). The model uses the acronym ART, which stands forAcknowledging a problem, Recognizing choices and choosing purposeful actions to take, and Turning toward self and others to reconnect with self and theenvironment in a way that fosters contentment. This model urges nurses to speakup and advocate for themselves rather than remaining silent or \"going along toget along,\" which results in a lose-lose situation. Effective nurse leaders and man-agers understand that their staff members \"want to be heard, understood, andrespected for what they bring to the workplace\" (Todaro-Franceschi, 2015). 288 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS 3021_Ch13_271-293 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 288Chapter 13 Creating and Sustaining a Healthy Work Environment 289 Table 13-1 Five Factors for Becoming a Skilled Communicator From Kupperschmidt, Kientz, Ward, & Reinholz, 2010.1.Becoming authentic 4.Becoming mindful 5.Becoming candidProcess of acknowledging a misconception that is favorable to the person who holds the misperception or failure to see that one has a problemProcess of pondering the meaning of an experience carefully and persistently, creating meaning from past or current events that guidefuture behavior, and self-questioning so situations become more clearand coherentProcess of self-discovery by understanding one's purpose, holding and practicing professional values, practicing with heart, establishingenduring relationships, and practicing self-disciplineProcess of developing a heightened awareness of and alertness toverbal and nonverbal communication, developing present-centeredawareness, and acknowledging and accepting each thought and feeling as it isProcess of purposefully speaking with frankness that is free from biasand risking speaking and hearing the truth Spector, P .

Aim This study aimed to provide a quantitative review to estimate nurses' exposurerates to workplace violence by types of violence, setting, source, and world region. Methods The investigators conducted a meta-analysis of articles using the following keyterms: nurse or nursing and aggression , bullying , sexual harassment , violence , and workplace violence . In all, 1,216 research reports were identified and narrowed down to 271 reports. The investigators reviewed the articles using the followingcriteria: Reports written in English Reports of empirical studies Reports related to violence against nurses A total of 136 research studies were analyzed, including data from 151,347 nurses in 38 countries. Key Findings The investigators explored the rate of violence exposure by looking at the percent-age of the sample that reported each type of violence and whether they were EXPLORING THE EVIDENCE 13-3 Continued3021_Ch13_271-293 14/01/17 3:52 PM Page 289290 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS physically injured. The five types of violence were physical, nonphysical, bullying, sexual harassment, and general violence (meaning nurses were asked if they weresubjected to some type of violence at work). In all, 36.4% of nurses reported beingphysically assaulted, 67.2% reported experiencing a nonphysical assault, 37.1%were bullied, 27.9% reported sexual harassment, and 50.5% indicated that they experienced general violence in their workplace. The majority of physical violencewas performed by patients and families. In contrast, health-care professionals accounted for the majority of nonphysical violence. Implications for Nurse Leaders and Managers This study provides an overview of the presence of workplace violence world-wide. Nurse leaders and managers can use this evidence as they implementworkplace violence prevention programs. Understanding the types of violenceprevalent and the initiators of the violence can help identify the type of programsnecessary. Further, the authors suggested that violence prevention programsshould include patients, families, physicians, nurses, and other health-care professionals.EXPLORING THE EVIDENCE 13- 3\u2014cont'd SUMMARY An unhealthy work environment lacks safe patient mobility equipment, ignores nurse fatigue, and encourages disruptive behaviors. Errors and preventable adverse outcomes, which are common in such environments, contribute to poorpatient satisfaction, increase cost of care, and negatively impact nurse retention.All nurses, regardless of role, have a responsibility to contribute to a safe andhealthy environment that encourages respectful interactions with patients, fami-lies, and colleagues (ANA, 2015a). Nurses at all levels and in all settings have amoral obligation to collaborate to create an environment that fosters respect andis free from workplace violence. Nurse leaders and managers have an ethical andlegal responsibility to provide a safe and healthy work environment. An environ-ment of mutual respect promotes joy and meaning at work and enables nurses tobe more satisfied and able to deliver more effective care. All factors that contributeto an unhealthy work environment must be addressed to ensure quality and pro-mote a culture of safety for both patients and staff. Otherwise, sustaining a cultureof safety becomes impossible.

Discuss emerging change theories. Describe the nurse leader and manager's role in the change process. Identify common human responses to change. Describe types of conflict common in the workplace. Describe five approaches to managing conflict. Change and conflict are ever present in health care today, thanks to constantly evolving technology, new regulations, changing public expectations, increasing environmental concerns, and heavy demand on scarce resources. In turn, nurses must be knowledgeable about the change process and understand that conflict can resultwhen the process is ineffective. In the dynamic environment of health care, changeis inevitable and unpredictable, and it affects staff, patients, and the organizationoverall. Historian and critical feminist Joan Wallach Scott states, \"Those who expectmoments of change to be comfortable and free of conflict have not learned their his-tory\" (Quote Garden, 2016). Change in the work environment can create uncertaintyand elicit emotional responses from employees (Bowers, 2011). Most people do notlike change, and when experiencing change, not all people respond in the same way. Nurses at all levels must develop a basic understanding of change theories and models to fulfill the social mandate for nursing practice outlined in the AmericanNurses Association (ANA, 2010) Nursing's Social Policy Statement, which states3021_Ch14_294-312 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 294Chapter 14 Leading Change and Managing Conflict 295 that nurses must be open to changes and willing to apply new evidence in practice as it emerges. In addition, nurses must embrace change to ensure that safe andquality nursing care is provided. Change can be difficult and is often met with resistance, which can result in con- flict. Nurse leaders and managers are instrumental in facilitating successful changeat both the unit and organizational levels. Successfully leading and managing thechange process are vital leadership skills (Stefancyk, Hancock, & Meadows, 2013).Nurse leaders and managers are called to \"take a leadership role and become earlyadopters in leading change, removing barriers, challenging the status quo, and creating innovative solutions to address nursing workforce issues that contributeto the health of America\" (ANA, 2016, p. 16). Although change is a very common cause of conflict, wise nurse leaders and man- agers recognize that conflict is always present in the workplace (Porter-O'Grady & Malloch, 2013). Further, conflict is dynamic and does not disappear; rather, it canonly be managed. Nurse leaders and managers have a responsibility to acquire theknowledge, skills, and attitudes to manage and lead change, engage staff in consen-sus building, and conflict management (ANA, 2016). In this chapter, traditional and emerging change theories and models are discussed. In addition, guidelines for managing change and innovation and conflict are covered. Knowledge, skills, and attitudes related to the following core competencies are included in this chapter: patient-centered care and teamwork and collaboration. CHANGE THEORIES Change is a dynamic process that results in altering or making something different. Change can be planned or unplanned. Planned change is purposeful, calculated, and collaborative, and it includes the deliberate application of change theories (Mitchell,2013; Roussel, 2013). Change that is purposeful and planned is usually well receivedby staff. In contrast, unplanned change occurs when the need for change is sudden and necessary to manage a crisis. Unplanned change can cause anxiety and stress amongstaff members. Successful nurse leaders and managers manage unplanned change\"through effective communication, adaptability, coordination, and the ability to re-main grounded\" (Erickson, 2014, p. 125). Highly effective nurse leaders and managersdevelop high-functioning, empowered teams whose members know what is expected,remain calm during crisis, and do what is right for the patients (Erickson, 2014).Closely related to and frequently an integral part of change is innovation , the process of creating something new after thoughtful analysis of a phenomenon or situation. Implementing change can be very challenging and yet is necessary for progress. Often, the change process fails because those executing the change neglect to takea structured approach. Planned change is best carried out using a theoretical frame-work or model (Mitchell, 2013; Shirey, 2013). The situation at hand and the type ofchange being implemented help determine the appropriate theory or frameworkto apply, lead, and manage the process, and this approach can result in a sustainablechange (Shirey, 2013). Because not all theories fit all nursing situations, nurse lead-ers and managers must be familiar with various change theories to be able to selecta framework wisely. The most common change theories and models used fall intotwo categories: 1) traditional theories and models and 2) emerging theories. 3021_Ch14_294-312 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 295Traditional Change Theories and Models Traditional change theories and models are linear and suggest that change occurs in a sequential manner. For the change to be successful, the organization or unitmust progress through each stage. These theories require ongoing work to ensurethat goals are met and change is sustained. Table 14-1 provides a comparison oftraditional change theories. Lewin's Force-Field Model (1951) Lewin's Force-Field theory is one of the most widely used theories. Lewin believedthat change results from two field or environmental forces: 1) driving forces (help-ing forces) that attempt to facilitate the change and move it forward and 2) restrain-ing forces (hindering forces) that attempt to impede change and maintain the status296 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS Table 14-1 Comparison of Traditional Change Theories and Models Theory and/ or Model Components in Model When to UseEight-Stage Process of Creating Major Change Establishing a sense of urgency Creating the guidingcoalition Developing a vision and strategy Communicating thechange vision Empowering broad-basedaction Generating short-termwins Consolidating gains andproducing more change Anchoring new approachesin the culture Effective model for rapidlychanging organizations andfor learning organizationsInnovation-DecisionProcess Knowledge Persuasion Decision Implementation Confirmation Model useful inindividual and organizationalchange and veryuseful when implementingtechnologicalchangePhases of Change Model Diagnosing the problem Assessing motivationand capacity forchange Assessing the changeagent's motivation andresources Selecting progressivechange objectives Choosing an appropri-ate role for the changeagent Maintaining the changeafter it has started Terminating the helpingrelationship General model useful formost planned 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 296Chapter 14 Leading Change and Managing Conflict 297 quo. Successful change requires the driving forces to be greater than the restraining forces. This three-step change model involves unfreezing the status quo, movingtoward the new way, and refreezing or stabilizing 2013): 1.The unfreezing stage is the point at which it is determined that change is needed, and driving and restraining forces are identified. The change agent must create a sense of urgency to change, strengthen the driving forces, and weaken the restraining forces for successful change. During this stage, nurse leaders andmanagers can help prepare staff members for the change by helping them rec-ognize the need for change, building trust, and actively engaging staff in thechange process. Motivation to change occurs in this stage. 2.The moving stage begins the initiation of the desired change. Information is gath- ered, the change is planned, and movement toward changing begins in thisstage. During the moving stage, the new innovation is examined, accepted, andtried. This stage requires unfreezing and moving toward a new way of thinkingand behaving. Nurse leaders and managers can facilitate movement by coachingthose affected by the change to overcome fears and engage them in problem-solving and working toward the desired outcome. 3.The refreezing stage involves stabilizing the change and achieving equilibrium. The innovation is incorporated into the routine. The change becomes the newnorm. In this stage, nurse leaders and managers should reinforce the changethrough formal and informal processes including policies, procedures, standardsof care, and other common tools used throughout the organization. This stageis crucial to sustaining change over time. Throughout the process, the nurse leader and manager must employ strategies to increase driving forces and/or decrease restraining forces for the change to be successful. Many other theories are based on Lewin's theory. Lippitt's Phases of Change Model (1958) Lippitt, Watson, and Wesley (1958) expanded Lewin's original theory by identify-ing additional stages of the change process. The Phases of Change Model uses language similar to the nursing process and focuses more on the people involved in the change process than on the change process itself. This model stresses theimportance of communication and rapport with those involved in the process. Themodel follows these seven steps (Lippitt, Watson, & Wesley, 1958; Mensik, 2014;Mitchell, 2013): 1.Diagnosing the problem involves identifying the need for the change and recruiting others to assist with data collection. Effective communication is critical in the first phase to avoid miscommunication through the grapevine. Nurse leadersand managers can spearhead drafting a plan for change at this time. 2.Assessing the motivation and capacity for change is actually assessing the unit or organization for readiness to change. Nurse leaders and managers must com-municate with those affected by the change, respond to concerns, provide rationale for the change, and identify possible resistance to the change.3021_Ch14_294-312 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 2973.Assessing the change agent's motivation and resources must be done for successful change to occur. The change agent must be willing to commit to the change and see the process through to the end. This phase requires nurse leaders and man-agers to identify their role in the change process. They must be realistic aboutthe time commitment necessary and recruit assistance. 4.Selecting progressive change objectives involves clearly defining the change, estab- lishing realistic goals, and developing a plan for change. Nurse leaders and man-agers actively assess their team and delegate appropriate responsibilities duringthis phase of the process. 5.Choosing an appropriate role for the change agent and implementing the plan for change comprise one of the final steps. It is important that nurse leaders andmanagers remain flexible during this stage. 6.Maintaining the change after it has started and as it is being incorporated into the unit or organization culture is critical. Nurse leaders and managers mon-itor the stability of the change as it becomes part of the system. Communica-tion and feedback are critical during this phase to avoid regressing to theprevious state. 7.Terminating the helping relationship once the process has stabilized occurs when the change agent withdraws from the process and the change is evaluated.Nurse leaders and managers continue monitoring and evaluating the changefor sustainability. The role of the change agent is extremely important in Lippitt's model. Nurse leaders and managers most often function in the change agent role and are respon- sible to drive \"the innovation into everyday practice\" (Mensik, 2014, p. 64). Rogers' Innovation-Decision Process (1995) Rogers (1995) broadened Lewin's theory and developed a five-stage innovation-decision process, which consists of a series of actions and choices over time that anindividual or decision-making unit must follow. Further, recognizing the commonbehavioral responses to change that individuals may experience can facilitatechange. The five stages are as follows (Rogers, 1995; Shirey, 2006): 1.Knowledge occurs when an individual or decision-making unit is exposed to an innovation and gains understanding of how it functions. Nurse leaders and man- agers create the need for the innovation and increase motivation among staffmembers to learn more about the innovation. 2.Persuasion occurs when an individual or decision-making unit forms a favorable or unfavorable attitude toward the innovation. The perceived attributes of theinnovation are key in this stage. Nurse leaders and managers can engage staffmembers to share positive experiences with the innovation with their peers topromote favorable attitudes. 3.Decision occurs when an individual or decision-making unit engages in activities to adopt or reject the innovation. To facilitate adoption, nurse leaders and man-agers may want to pilot the innovation on a specific unit. Staff members can thenexperience the desirable qualities of the innovation. 298 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS 3021_Ch14_294-312 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 298Chapter 14 Leading Change and Managing Conflict 299 4.Implementation occurs when an individual or decision-making unit begins using an innovation. Nurse leaders and managers must ensure that adequate technical support and proper infrastructure are available during implementation to avoidstalling the innovation. 5.Confirmation occurs when an individual or decision-making unit seeks reinforce- ment of a decision made or reverses a previous decision to adopt or reject inno-vation (Rogers, 1995, p. 162). Overall, staff members desire to avoid conflict andwork to keep the innovation going. Nurse leaders and managers may provideencouragement and validate that the decision was the correct one (Shirey, 2006).Long-term support may be needed to stabilize the change and help those involved develop self-reliance during this phase. Rogers suggests that, for change to be successful, everyone involved with the change and/or affected by the change must be committed to the change. In addi- tion, nurse leaders and managers must deal with behavioral responses to changeand attempt to figure out how to channel negative responses into support for thechange or innovation (Rogers, 1995). Nurse leaders and managers are involved increating a shared vision for the innovation and provide the leadership needed tosustain the change (Mensik, 2014). Kotter's Eight-Stage Process of Creating Major Change (1996) Kotter (1996) suggested that successful change involves a multistep process thatovercomes all sources of resistance and must be directed by high-quality leadership.He describes eight stages of the change process that can help nurse leaders andmanagers manage change cognitively as well as emotionally (Kotter, 1996): 1.Establishing a sense of urgency involves examining the competition or need for change to improve quality and/or safety. During this stage, nurse leaders and managers must discuss major opportunities and potential crises identified andpresent convincing evidence for the need to change. 2.Creating the guiding coalition means putting together a group with the necessary power to lead the change and getting everyone to work together. Identifyingkey staff members and empowering them to participate in the change process isimportant for nurse leaders and managers during this stage. 3.Developing a vision and strategy means creating a vision to direct the change effort. Nurse leaders and managers spend time during this stage making the visionclear and understandable for everyone. 4.Communicating the change vision to everyone involved in or affected by the change is important, as is having the leader or manager model the behavior expected ofemployees. The goal for nurse leaders and managers is to persuade as many staffmembers as possible to embrace the vision. 5.Empowering broad-based action involves changing systems or structures that undermine the vision, getting rid of obstacles, and encouraging risk takingand nontraditional ideas. Nurse leaders and managers must actively confrontopponents. In addition, they can provide information and assist staff membersto embrace the vision. 3021_Ch14_294-312 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 2996.Generating short-term wins consists of planning for and creating improvements in performance, or \"wins,\" and visibly recognizing and rewarding those respon- sible for the \"wins.\" The focus is on lessening the impact of the cynics, pes-simists, and skeptics by rewarding and motivating staff members embracing thechange (Salmela, Eriksson, & Fagerstr\u00f6m, 2013). 7.Consolidating gains and producing more change include using increased credibility to change systems and processes that do not fit the vision. This stage also involveshiring, promoting, and developing those who can implement the vision, as wellas reinvigorating the process with new projects and themes. 8.Anchoring new approaches in the culture is creating better performance through productivity orientation and through better and more effective leadership andmanagement. In this stage, the connection between behavior and organizationalsuccess is emphasized, as well as ensuring leadership development and succes-sion (Kotter, 1996, p. 21). Nurse leaders and managers focus on sustaining thechange or innovation. Nurse leaders and managers are seen in Kotter's model as important during the various phases of the process because of their keen communication skills, ability to anchor the vision of the change, and skill in persuading staff members to embracethe change (Salmela et al., 2013). 300 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS Salmela, S., Eriksson, K., & Fagerstr\u00f6m, L. (2013). Nurse leaders' perceptions of an approaching organizational change. Qualitative Health Research , 23(5), 689-699. Aim The aim of this study was to understand nurse leaders' perceptions of an approaching organizational change (e.g., a merger between a health-care center and a hospital). Methods This study was a qualitative study using a hermeneutical design and Kotter'sEight-Stage Process of Creating Major Change as a theoretical framework. Seventeen nurse leaders participated in semistructured interviews. The interviews sought to obtain information related to nurse leaders' views of the following: Change and the approaching merger and change process Their roles as leaders during the change process Their previous change experiences Data from the interviews were analyzed using a hermeneutical interpretive process. EXPLORING THE EVIDENCE 14-13021_Ch14_294-312 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 300Chapter 14 Leading Change and Managing Conflict 301 Key Findings The study resulted in three main themes: 1.Positive and active engagement in continuous change: Nurse leaders in the study indicated an understanding of change as part of the daily routine, and they were very willing to participate and influence staff members as nurse leaders. 2.Confidence in change and adaptation without deeper engagement: Nurse leaders in the study had positive attitudes, which enabled them to see the possibilities,and understood that change is necessary. 3.Feelings of insecurity and anxiety: Nurse leaders in the study were experiencing uncertainty about their roles as leaders and anxiety related to the demandsplaced on them currently and anticipated in the future. They also felt as if theywere spectators in the change process. Implications for Nurse Leaders and Managers Nurse leaders and managers are great resources for organizational change.However, according to the authors of the study, nurse leaders and managers are not always included by upper administration when organizational change is being implemented. The findings of this study suggest that nurse leaders and managers are in critical positions to influence organizational change for apositive outcome. Further, including nurse leaders and managers at all levelscan facilitate the change process across the organization.EXPLORING THE EVIDENCE 14- 1\u2014cont'd Emerging Change Theories Traditional theories are useful in providing structure and direction for change. However, the linear models do not recognize the dynamic context in which changeoccurs and the unanticipated human actions and responses. Newer theories areemerging that are more complex than the traditional theories. Systems theory pro-vides the foundation for emerging theories of change. Using a systems approachto change and innovation results in a comprehensive view and realization thatsystems are complex. Human beings, families, organizations, cities, and nationsare all systems with interrelationships among members, and a close look at thoseinterrelationships reveals infinite complexity. Emerging theories are cyclical rather than linear and require organizations to react with speed and flexibility. The newer theories provide another perspectivefrom which to view change and innovation based on complexity science. Complex-ity science recognizes that the world is in continual motion and that a change inone area can result in numerous changes in other areas. Change and innovationfrom the perspective of complexity science are highly interrelated, dynamic, andunpredictable (Porter-O'Grady & Malloch, 2013). Understanding complex systemswhen leading and managing change results in a collective commitment to the3021_Ch14_294-312 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 301change created. Two theories based on complexity science and systems theory, chaos theory and learning organization theory (discussed in detail in Chapter 8),are actually used to understand organizational behavior. Chaos theory and learningorganizations theory are also used to understand change and innovation. Nurseleaders and managers who understand these theories in relation to change and innovation can assist staff through the change process successfully. Chaos Theory Many relate chaos to complete randomness. In fact, the word chaos is derived from the Greek language and means \"formless matter.\" However, even when asystem may appear chaotic and disorderly, there is actually an underlying com-plex order. Chaos theory is nonlinear and unpredictable, and it explains why a small change in one area can have a large affect across an organization. This is also known as the \"butterfly effect,\" or the notion that the flapping of a but-terfly's wings in one part of the world can have a major impact, such as a hurri-cane or tsunami, on the other side of the world (Crowell, 2011; Mensik, 2014;Porter-O'Grady & Malloch, 2010). Nurse leaders and managers must be awareof the complexity of health care, the unit, and the organization. Further, theymust understand that, because of multiple factors, decisions made can result inchanges that were unintended. Learning Organization Theory Learning organization theory was first described by Senge (1990), who suggestedthat to excel, future organizations will need to \"discover how to tap people's com-mitment and capacity to learn at all levels in an organization\" (p. 4). He called onleaders to move away from traditional authoritarian \"controlling organizations\" tolearning organizations. In a learning organization, all staff members are involved inproblem-solving and implementing change and innovation, and this involvementenables the organization to respond quickly to chaos. Senge (1990) defined a learning organization as an \"organization where people continually expand their capacity to create the results they truly desire, where new and expansive patterns of thinkingare nurtured, where collective aspiration is set free, and where people are continuallylearning how to learn together\" (p. 3). Senge identified systems thinking, personalmastery, mental models, building shared vision, and team learning as five disciplinesthat organizations need to adopt and practice to become learning organizations. Members of a learning organization are continually practicing the five disciplines and are continually learning. The more learning that occurs, the more aware themembers become of what they can still learn. In health care, adopting the five disciplines has the potential to result in high-quality and safe patient care. Nurseleaders and managers who help staff members see the larger system build an understanding of complex problems. This understanding enables staff members todevelop long-term changes and work together to impact the whole system, ratherthan pursuing symptomatic fixes to parts of the whole (Senge, Hamilton, & Kania,2015). In turn, change and innovation can be sustained over time.302 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS 3021_Ch14_294-312 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 302Chapter 14 Leading Change and Managing Conflict 303 MANAGING CHANGE AND INNOVATION Managing change and innovation requires nurse leaders and managers to know the who, why, what, when, and how of change (Porter-O'Grady & Malloch, 2013): Who: The who of change are the key stakeholders (e.g., patients and families, employees, communities) related to the work to be changed. To be able to changeor motivate stakeholders, nurse leaders and managers must understand theirown comfort and competence related to change. Nurse leaders and managersmust be self-aware regarding their knowledge or lack of knowledge of the changeprocess, personal comfort with change and risk taking, relationships, conflict,and negotiation skills. Why: The why of change is a reasonable rationale for the change. A lack of understanding for the reason for change can result in resistance and unsuccessfulimplementation of the change and innovation. Given the complexity of healthcare and the limited resources today, change and innovation should be evidencebased and linked to patient safety, quality health care, and improving the workenvironment. What: The what of change is the actual change or innovation being implemented. Identifying what to change is determined after the rationale for the change isclear. Change and innovation may involve revising or creating policies, processes,procedures, and/or standards. Keep in mind that implementing the specificchange may require additional resources and technology as well as educationand competency development for staff. When: The when of change is determining at what point to start the change process and how long it will take to achieve the change. The timing for changecan be directed by the impetus behind the change. However, when to change isbest determined by those who will be most involved with or impacted by theoutcome of the change. How: The how of change involves the techniques or processes needed for successful and sustainable change. Facilitating change and innovation is more than establishing and implementing a plan. It requires four specific competencies (Porter-O'Grady & Malloch, 2013, p. 51): 1.Personal knowledge of and accountability for one's own strengths and limita- tions specific to change and innovation, including technical capability andcomputer literacy 2.Understanding the essence of change and innovation concepts as well as thetools of innovation 3.The ability to collaborate and fully engage team members 4.Competence in embracing vulnerability and risk taking Nurse leaders and managers are responsible for designing innovations to effect change in practice and outcomes (ANA, 2016). The American Organization of Nurse Executives (AONE) established competencies for nurse leaders and man-agers, including communication and relationship building, knowledge of thehealth-care environment, leadership, professionalism, and business skills (AONE, 3021_Ch14_294-312 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 3032015). Change management is considered part of the leadership competency and includes the following skills (AONE, 2015, p. 8): Using change theory to plan for the implementation of organizational changes Serving as a change agent by assisting others in understanding the importance,necessity, impact, and process of change Supporting staff during times of difficult transitions Recognizing one's own reaction to change and striving to remain open to newideas and approaches Adapting leadership style to situational needs Effective nurse leaders and managers should be concerned with both people and productivity during the change process. Nurse leaders and managers must valuestaff and create an environment that supports the change. Managing change meansbeing a change agent, responding effectively to change, adopting change, and beingprepared to deal with barriers to change. Becoming a Change Agent Nurses at all levels can facilitate change. A change agent is one who leads and man- ages the change process, including management of group dynamics, resistance to change, continuous communication, and the momentum toward the desired outcome. The responsibilities of a change agent can include the following: Gathering data necessary to identify a problem that needs to be changed Informing members of the group that change is needed and facilitating them to recognize and acknowledge the need for change Setting goals and objectives for the change and developing a plan Identifying those who will be affected by the change and including them in the process Identifying resisting and driving forces Implementing the change Communicating continuously during the process Providing support during the process Evaluating the change and make modifications to the plan as necessary Change agents must be effective communicators and must excel at interpersonal skills. Change agents need to develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to alignpeople, processes, and purposes to achieve the change and innovation. Nurse lead-ers and managers often find themselves functioning as change agents. As changeagents, nurse leaders and managers are responsible to manage change and assiststaff in the change process. When nurse leaders and managers model a positive and enthusiastic approach to change and innovation, they can inspire staff. Responding to Change Resistance to change is common. Various factors can affect a person's ability to handle change and innovation, such as adaptability, comfort with the status quo,304 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS 3021_Ch14_294-312 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 304Chapter 14 Leading Change and Managing Conflict 305 perceptions of the benefits of the change, and how threatened a person feels by the change. Effective change agents anticipate human responses to change and includestrategies to manage the responses in the plan. Staff members need time to adjustto the thought of change and time to adjust to the actual change. Nurse leaders andmanagers can help staff cope with change by making sure the rationale for thechange is clear and allowing staff members to verbalize concerns and express theiremotions. During the change process, nurse leaders and managers can also helpstaff members cope by ensuring open communication, providing feedback on aregular basis, and empowering them throughout the change process. As change agents, nurse leaders and managers can use several strategies when dealing with resistance. Different strategies work in different situations, so changeagents must consider which strategy is most appropriate for the change or innovationto be successful. Chinn and Benne (1969) described three common change strategiesthat can be useful for nurse leaders and managers during the change process. The normative-reeducative strategy focuses on the relationship needs of staff members, uses peer pressure, and relies on staff members' desires to have satisfactory work relation-ships (Chinn & Benne, 1969). The normative-reeducative strategy is used when someresistance is expected but nurse leaders and managers believe that staff will succumbto peer pressure rather than resist the change. The empirical-rational strategy assumes that staff members are essentially self-interested and providing information and ed-ucation will assist staff in changing behavior and adopting the change or innovation(Chinn & Benne, 1969). Typically, when a change is being implemented the first stepis to explain the need for the change. Once staff members understand the need forchange and perceive personal benefit, they will embrace it. The empirical-rationalstrategy is useful when minimal resistance is expected. The power-coercive strategy is based on power and authority and assumes that staff will respond to authority andthreats of job loss (Chinn & Benne, 1969). This strategy is used when resistance is ex-pected but nurse leaders and managers plan to implement the change regardless ofhow the majority feels. The power-coercive strategy results in rapid change and is oftenperceived by staff members as they must accept the change or find a new place to work. Adopting Change In general, people adopt change at different times during the process. Rogers (1995)suggested that people adopt change in various stages and can be categorized into fivegroups, as he illustrated the categories on a bell curve. Figure 14-1 illustrates the cat-egories of change adopters. The first 2.5% of people to adopt change are the \"innova-tors,\" also known as venturesome. Innovators are willing to take risks. The next 13.5%to embrace the innovation are called \"early adopters\"; they are more discerning whenchoosing to adopt an innovation. The \"early majority\" makes up the next 34% to adoptthe change. Known to be deliberate, the early majority usually interacts with the earlyadopters before making decisions. The \"late majority\" comprises the next 34%, whoare skeptical and reluctant to adopt an innovation until most others have done so. Finally, the last to accept change are the \"laggards\" at 16%, who are stuck in the pasttraditions. Each category has specific characteristics. Nurse leaders must understandeach group and how to focus time and energy appropriately to maximize the changeeffort. Table 14-2 lists the categories of change adopters and related characteristics.3021_Ch14_294-312 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 305Dealing With Barriers to Change Change will happen. Change and innovation are necessary for survival and growth of health care and the nursing profession (Roussel, 2013). Continually facilitating staff to focus on the change or innovation must be a priority for nurse306 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS Innovators 2.5%Early Adopters Majority 34%Late categories.

However, 75% of all change initiatives fail (Manion, 2011, p. 230). Change initiatives typically fail because of poor coordination, ineffectivecommunication, and lack of staff cooperation. Thoughtful planning and ongoingcommunication can help overcome barriers to change. Nurse leaders and man-agers must position themselves to be in the forefront of change and innovation(Shirey, 2006). Further, they must be the coaches, encouragers, and positive rolemodels for change (Anderson, 2014). Nurse leaders and managers must be committed to and exhibit an attitude that supports the change or innovation. When change or innovation is imposed on thestaff in an authoritarian manner, resistance is inevitable. Nurse leaders and man-agers can establish an environment for change by the following means (Roussel,2013, p. 146): Emphasizing relationships among staff members Building mutual trust and confidence Emphasizing interdependence and shared responsibility Ensuring that responsibilities are shared equitably among all groups Managing conflict effectively Supporting careers by permitting job movement Anticipating and rewarding change Modifying the nursing organizational structure to accommodate changes thatprovide staff growth and development Promoting a \"can-do\" attitude Providing predictability and stability Sharing bad news early, when necessary Fostering a shift toward teamwork and process improvement Savvy nurse leaders and managers recognize that there are different strategies for managing change and strive to match approaches to their particular circum-stances to optimize the change process. Ineffective leaders try to make change happen, whereas system leaders focus on creating conditions that can create sustainable change (Senge et al., 2015). MANAGING CONFLICT The health-care system is complex and constantly changing, and various demandsin the workplace can generate conflict among staff members and others. Conflict is a state of disharmony among people and occurs when people have differing views. LEARNING ACTIVITY 14-1 How Do You Respond to Change? Think about a recent experience that involved some type of change on your part. 1. What category of adopters do you fall under? (See Table 14-2.) 2. Do you believe you need improvement in how you respond to change?3. List two or three strategies you can use to improve your response to change. 3021_Ch14_294-312 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 307A little conflict is good and can result in organizational growth. In contrast, too much conflict can paralyze an organization or unit. Conflict, if not managed, canresult in stress for all involved, interfere with the ability to work together, and negatively impact patient care. Further, unmanaged conflict can result in decreasedstaff morale, increased turnover, poor-quality patient care, increased health-carecosts, and patient dissatisfaction (Losa Iglesias & De Bengoa Vallejo, 2012). Com-mon factors that result in conflict can be related to personnel issues, personal issues,work environment, power struggles, differing value systems, and leadership andmanagement styles (Padrutt, 2010). Therefore, all nurses at all levels must under-stand conflict and how it can be managed. Nurse leaders and managers must strive to promote \"ongoing evaluation and continuous improvement of conflict resolution skills\" (ANA, 2016, p. 49). Nurseleaders and managers spend close to one-fourth of their time in conflict managementactivities (Padrutt, 2010; Rundio & Wilson, 2013; Valentine, 2001). It is imperativefor nurse leaders and managers to learn how to deal with conflict and role modeleffective conflict management for staff. When managed effectively, conflict can pro-vide a mechanism through which work can be accomplished. Findings from onestudy suggest that interpersonal conflicts in the workplace should be confronted directly, constructively, and together with those involved (Mahon & Nicotera, 2011).However, nurses in general are highly unlikely to confront conflict and respond byavoidance or withdrawal (Mahon & Nicotera, 2011). Poorly managed conflict canpose additional problems in the workplace such as job dissatisfaction, depression,increased turnover, compromised patient safety, and aggression. Types of Conflict Conflict management requires nurse leaders and managers to assess the situation,identify the type of conflict, and explore perceptions about the conflict with thoseinvolved. The type of conflict directs the conflict management strategy that is used. Intrapersonal Conflict Intrapersonal conflict is an internal conflict, or a conflict coming from within aperson. An individual may be confronted with an issue or situation that createsa sense of discomfort within. An example of intrapersonal conflict is a nurse try-ing to make a decision to go back to school for an advanced degree who may experience conflict between personal and professional goals (e.g., balancing family life and pursuing professional advancement). An individual nurse's intrapersonal conflict can affect others on the unit, thus resulting in interpersonalconflict (Padrutt, 2010). Interpersonal Conflict Interpersonal conflict occurs when there is a disagreement between or among twoor more people. The disagreement can be related to differing values, ethics, goals,beliefs, or priorities. Interpersonal conflict is very common in the workplace. An308 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS 3021_Ch14_294-312 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 308Chapter 14 Leading Change and Managing Conflict 309 example of interpersonal conflict is a difference of opinion between a nurse and a family member regarding a patient's living will. Intergroup Conflict Also common in the workplace is conflict that occurs between groups of people,also called intergroup conflict. For example, the emergency department staff maycomplain that patients are not moved to the intensive care unit in a timely manner,and in turn, staff members in the intensive care unit complain that the emergencydepartment staff is always demanding to transport patients before patients aredischarged, thereby making beds available. Organizational Conflict Organizational conflict can result when there is disagreement between staff andorganizational policies and procedures, standards, or changes being made. Forexample, administration implements a new procedure for nurses to use whendocumenting nursing care without input from the nurses. This can cause organi-zational conflict because administration implements a change without consultingthose it impacts most, nurses at the bedside. Conflict Management Strategies There are five common strategies for conflict management (Thomas & Kilman,1977), and each is used successfully to manage conflict in different situations.Typically, most people use a combination of strategies when dealing with conflict.The five strategies are as follows (Thomas & Kilman, 1977): 1.The avoiding strategy involves withdrawing or hiding from the conflict. The strat- egy is not always effective in resolving conflict and just postpones the conflict. Because the conflict is not resolved, it may reappear again later. 2.Accommodating involves sacrificing one's own needs or goals and trying to satisfy another's desires, needs, or goals. This strategy does not resolve conflict andmay result in future conflict. 3.Individuals who use the competing strategy pursue their own needs, desires, or goals at the expense of others. The competitor wants to win and is not coopera-tive. This strategy is power driven and can result in aggression. 4.Compromising is an effective conflict management strategy. When compromising, everyone gives something up, and everyone gets something they want in return.However, to be effective, those involved must be on an even playing field. 5.Collaborating is the best strategy to use in conflict management because it involves a shared approach to resolving conflict. Shared goals are identified, and a com-mitment to working together is implemented by those involved. Collaboratingis time consuming, but it results in the best chance of a resolution (Padrutt, 2010). Effective conflict management requires those involved to use a variety of strategies based on the situation (Sportsman & Hamilton, 2007). A nurse's perceptions, values,3021_Ch14_294-312 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 309beliefs, and attitudes play a role in the conflict process and how conflict is managed (Whitworth, 2008). Effective nurse leaders and managers recognize the differencesin personalities of staff members and their methods of handling conflict and under-stand the impact the differences can have in the workplace. Ineffective conflict man-agement can result in excessive stress for those involved and negatively impactinterpersonal relationships. In contrast, effective conflict management results in pos-itive outcomes, including improved work relationships and increased productivity. Role of Nurse Leaders and Managers in Addressing Conflict Nurse leaders and managers are challenged to learn to deal with conflict in a waythat will manage the issues at hand while maintaining positive relationships amongstaff members. Establishing open communication and employing active listeningskills can help nurse leaders and managers manage conflict on the unit. Often, chal-lenging individuals can cause conflict among staff. Nurse leaders and managersneed to work to engage all staff members as a team to create safe, quality patientoutcomes. In addition, nurse leaders and managers must encourage positive inter-actions among staff members and health-care providers as part of a healthy workenvironment (Sportsman & Hamilton, 2007). A healthy work environment is dis-cussed in Chapter 13. Nurse leaders and managers need to mediate when interpersonal or inter- group conflict occurs to avoid negative effects on nursing care and patient out-comes. Elements that should be explored include the following (Porter-O'Grady& Malloch, 2013): Mutual respect: Those involved in the conflict may need a reminder to be respectful and focus on the issue and not the other person. Needs versus wants: The nurse leader and manager must help those involved differentiate between what they need and what they want. Compassion and empathy: Those involved in the conflict may need assistance understanding each other and hearing the other person's position. Staying in the \"I\": The nurse leader and manager reminds those involved to focus on \"I\" statements and avoid using \"you\" statements and avoid blaming. When dealing with conflict among staff members, nurse leaders and managers should avoid criticizing or passing judgment on others' opinions. Instead, theymust focus on how team members' behaviors have impacted team outcomes. A successful nurse leader and manager identifies conflict, works with those involved to manage and/or resolve the issues, and moves on (Porter-O'Grady& Malloch, 2013). SUMMARY The rapidly changing health-care environment today requires nurse leaders andmanagers to develop knowledge and skills in leading and managing change andinnovation. Nurse leaders and managers must be skilled in understanding changetheory, serving as change agents, and supporting staff during the change process.310 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS 3021_Ch14_294-312 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 310Chapter 14 Leading Change and Managing Conflict 311 Regardless of how important a change or innovation is, nurse leaders and managers must consider human response and include strategies to help staff members copewith change in the overall plan. Further, nurse leaders and managers must under-stand that conflict can result from change and be willing to apply strategies to man-age change as needed. Nurses at all levels must also understand that conflict is partof change, it can be healthy, and it allows for new ideas to emerge.

Explain the stages of team development. Identify characteristics of an effective team. Describe the role of nurse leaders and managers in fostering teamwork and collaboration. International evidence suggests that teams composed of various health-care pro- fessionals can maximize the strengths of health-care professionals, enhance work processes, and improve patient care outcomes (World Health Organization [WHO], 2010). The complexity of health care globally today requires a collaborative approachto ensure patient safety and quality care. Historically, nurses have been in the habitof working alone, developing plans of care without considering the patient and theirfamily or other health-care professionals. Nurses are called to provide patient-centered care as members of interprofessional teams, emphasizing evidence-basedpractice, quality improvement approaches, and informatics (Cronenwett et al., 2007;Greiner & Knebel, 2003). Nurses must shift their mental models from working insilos to collaborating as members of the health-care team. This chapter discusses teamwork and collaboration, including the stages of team development and the characteristics of an effective team. The role of nurse leadersand managers in fostering teamwork and collaboration is also covered.3021_Ch15_313-326 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 313314 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS Knowledge, skills, and attitudes related to the following core competencies are included in this chapter: patient-centered care and teamwork and collaboration. TEAMWORK AND COLLABORATION Nurses at all levels must gain the knowledge and develop the necessary skills and attitudes to be able to collaborate on intraprofessional and interprofessional teams.Teamwork and collaboration require \"function[ing] effectively within nursing andinterprofessional teams, fostering open communication, mutual respect, and shareddecision-making to achieve quality patient care\" (Cronenwett et al., 2007, p. 125). Intraprofessional teams are teams of nurses at various levels in the organization col- laborating to ensure that patient care is continuous and reliable (American Associ-ation of Colleges of Nursing [AACN], 2008). When intraprofessional relationshipsare strong, synergy is created, and nurses at all levels function as an efficient andeffective team. Teamwork and collaboration are important to safe and quality care and a healthy work environment, whether nurse leaders and managers are building a team onthe unit or across the organization. Nurses at all levels must collaborate and func-tion on various teams important to the overall goal of delivering safe and qualitycare. The American Nurses Association (ANA) and the American Organization ofNurse Executives (AONE) (2011) developed the document Principles for Collaborative Relationships Between Clinical Nurses and Nurse Managers that outlines the necessary principles for intraprofessional teamwork and collaboration: effective communica-tion, authentic relationships, and learning environments and culture. Effective communication requires an understanding of the underlying context of the situation, an appreciation for the tone and emotions of a conversation, and accurateinformation. Principles include the following (ANA and AONE, 2011, para. 5-6): Engaging in active listening to understand and contemplate fully what is beingrelayed Knowing the intent of a message and the purpose and expectations of thatmessage Fostering an open, safe environment Whether giving or receiving information, making sure that it is accurate Having people speak to the person they need to speak to, so the right person getsthe right information Authentic relationships bolster the profession and the quality of care patients receive. Nurses must cultivate caring relationships with each other similar to thenurse-patient relationship, by (ANA and AONE, 2011, para. 7-8): Being true to yourself and being sure that actions match words and that thosearound you are confident that what they see is what they get Empowering others to have ideas, to share those ideas, and to participate in projects that leverage or enact those ideas Recognizing and leveraging each other's strengths Being honest 100% of the time with yourself and with others Respecting the personalities, needs, and wants of others Asking for what you want but staying open to negotiating the difference3021_Ch15_313-326 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 314Chapter 15 Building and Managing Teams 315 Assuming good intent from the words and actions of others and assuming that they are doing their best A learning environment and learning culture support great nursing care and give nurses the satisfaction of knowing that their work is valuable and meaningfulby (ANA and AONE, 2011, p. 9-10): Inspiring innovative and creative thinking Committing to a cycle of evaluating, improving, and celebrating, and valuingwhat is going well Creating a culture of safety, both physically and psychologically Sharing knowledge and learning from mistakes Questioning the status quo\u2014ask \"what if,\" not \"no way\" Nurse leaders and managers must be committed to maintaining a high level of staff involvement, which will enhance job satisfaction and promote staff retention.In turn, staff satisfaction has been attributed to reduced medication errors, decreasedpatient falls, and a decline in patient deaths (LeBlanc, 2014; Wessel, 2015). Interprofessional teams are teams made up of health-care professionals, the patient, and the patient's family working together to collaborate, communicate, and integratecare to ensure that patient care is continuous and reliable (AACN, 2008). Patient-centered care is closely linked to teamwork and collaboration and requires health-careprofessionals to actively involve or give control to the patient and the family in allhealth-care decisions (Disch, 2012). Nurses at all levels must promote patients' capacityfor optimum involvement in their care and problem-solving (ANA, 2015). Further,nurses must establish partnerships with other health-care professionals on interpro-fessional teams based on the recognition of each profession's value and contributions,mutual trust, respect, open discussion, and shared decision making (ANA, 2015).Nurses at all levels have a responsibility to bring their unique nursing perspective tointerprofessional teams to advocate for greater quality care and optimum patient out-comes and to deliver evidence-based, patient-centered care (AACN, 2008). Teamwork is \"sharing one's expertise and relinquishing some autonomy work closely with others, including patients and communities, to achieve better out-comes\" (Interprofessional Education Collaborative Expert Panel [IPEC], 2011, p. 24). Teamwork involves integrating the knowledge, expertise, and experienceof health-care professionals to work collaboratively in planning and deliveringpatient-centered care that is safe, timely, efficient, effective, and equitable (IPEC,2011). Functioning as an effective team member requires nurses at all levels tocollaborate with other team members, patients, and their families, by using avail-able evidence to inform shared decision making and problem-solving. Inspiredby a vision of interprofessional collaborative practice as key to safe, high-quality,accessible, patient-centered care, the IPEC identified four core competency domains of interprofessional collaborative practice (IPEC, 2011): 1.Values and ethics for interprofessional practice requires \"working with individuals of other professions to maintain a climate of mutual respect and shared values\" (p. 19). 2.The general competency statement reflecting roles and responsibilities is \"use the knowledge of one's own role and those of other professions to appropriately assess and address the healthcare needs of the patients and populations served\" (p. 21).3021_Ch15_313-326 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 3153.Interprofessional communication means \"to communicate with patients, families, communities, and other health professionals in a responsive and responsible manner that supports a team approach to the maintenance of health and thetreatment of disease\" (p. 23). 4.The general competency statement for teams and teamwork is to \"apply relationship- building values and the principles of team dynamics to perform effectively indifferent team roles to plan and deliver patient-/population-centered care thatis safe, timely, efficient, effective, and equitable\" (p. 25). Collaboration is working jointly with others in a mutually beneficial and well- defined interprofessional relationship to achieve common goals (Lukas & Andrews,2014; Mensik, 2014). Collaboration is slowly becoming a reality in health care today.Research suggests that collaboration improves coordination, communication, qual-ity, and safety of patient care (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation [RWJF], 2011).Health-care professionals work together on a continuum that reflects the level ofintensity in the working relationship (Lukas & Andrews, 2014). Cooperation is atthe lower end of intensity and involves short, informal relationships in which theparties maintain their individual goals. Next on the continuum is coordination,which is longer term and involves planning and some shared resources and goals.The highest level of intensity is collaboration, which requires commitment to sharedgoals by all parties. Figure 15-1 illustrates this continuum. Collaboration uses theindividual and collective skills and experience of team members, and it allows themto function more effectively and deliver a higher level of services than each wouldbe able to provide alone (RWJF, 2011, p. 1). Teamwork and collaboration requirenurses at all levels to use effective communication skills to collaborate and functionon interprofessional and intraprofessional teams. Nurse leaders and managers need to foster teamwork among staff members not only to improve patient outcomes but also to encourage growth both individuallyand as an organization (Hader, 2013). Improving the use of teamwork and collab-oration can benefit patients, staff, and the overall organization. Teamwork benefitspatients by decreasing adverse events and increasing patient satisfaction. Nursesbenefit from teamwork because it decreases fatigue and burnout and improvesmorale and work satisfaction. The organization benefits because satisfied patientsand nurses decrease litigation and turnover as well as improve the organization'sreputation (The Joint Commission, 2012).316 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS \u0081 Short-term \u0081 Informal relationships\u0081 Separate goals, resources, and \u0081 Some planning \u0081 Division of roles \u0081 Some shared resources, rewards, and risks\u0081 Longer-term \u0081 Pervasive relationships \u0081 Group commitment to common goals \u0081 Everyone contributes resources, share rewards, share leadershipCooperation Coordination Collaboration Figure 15-1 Working together continuum.3021_Ch15_313-326 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 316Chapter 15 Building and Managing Teams 317 TEAM BUILDING There is overwhelming evidence that the quality of teamwork and collaboration can determine whether a patient receives safe, competent, quality care in a timelymanner (Wachter, 2012). As health-care organizations are faced with increasing demands for quality, as well as pressure to control costs and increase productivity,effective team building is an optimum strategy to meet these mandates. All nursesat all levels must engage in teamwork to collaborate with patients, families, andother health-care professionals to deliver safe and quality nursing care (ANA, 2015).Nurse leaders and managers are critical to building successful and satisfying teams(LeBlanc, 2014). They must engage in teamwork as both team builders and teamplayers and provide direction to enhance the effectiveness of the team (ANA, 2016).Effective team building encourages staff commitment, creativity, support, andgrowth of individuals, the unit, and the organization (Roussel, 2013). Teams are formed for different purposes. The nurse leader and manager makes hiring decisions for the purpose of building the intraprofessional nursing team for theunit. This team functions according to specific job descriptions and has clearly definedroles and responsibilities. The intraprofessional nursing team provides specific servicesor nursing care depending on the unit or department. Committees are formal teamswithin the organizational structure. The types of committees used in an organizationor unit are usually determined by the mission, vision, and philosophy. Committeescan be intraprofessional or interprofessional. An example of an intraprofessional com-mittee is a nursing professional practice committee, which includes a registered nursefrom all units or departments within the organization. An example of an interprofes-sional committee is a hospital ethics committee, which may include registerednurses from several units or departments, a physician representative, social workers,a chaplain, a patient advocate, other health-care professionals, and a health-care consumer (often a former patient). Unit or department special task forces or ad hoccommittees are formed to address a particular issue or project in a specific time frame.Members are designated by nurse leaders and managers and are given guidelines forthe work of the team. Typically, a task force or ad hoc committee is time limited andincludes several members who have expertise and/or interest in the special project.An example of a task force is a team working on a quality improvement project. When building teams, nurse leaders and managers ask themselves several key questions (Mensik, 2014): What are the tasks the team needs to accomplish? Are the tasks new or have theybeen done before? Do the tasks require independent or interdependent work? Is representation from various levels of the organization needed? Is geographical, educational, and interprofessional diversity needed? What skill mix is necessary for the team to succeed? Does including team mem-bers with previous experience on successful teams help those members who donot have experience? Finally, nurse leaders and managers should avoid asking the same reliable peo- ple to participate on teams. It may take extra effort, but encouraging new staff mem-bers to participate can bring new perspectives and avoid burn out among the moreexperienced staff members. 3021_Ch15_313-326 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 317Stages of Team Development Nurse leaders and managers must be aware of group dynamics and be prepared to facilitate the work of the team, if needed. All teams go through a series of stagesas they are being formed, begin working, and accomplish their goals. Tuckman(1965) conducted a literature review to explore group process and to isolate com-mon concepts and produce a model of group changes over time. He reviewed 55 articles and identified four stages of group development: forming, storming,norming, and performing. In 1977, Tuckman and Jensen reviewed the literaturepublished since the original four stages were identified and added a fifth stage, adjourning (Tuckman & Jensen, 1977). Tuckman's stages have been used since the1970s to describe the various phases of group development and team building.These stages continue to be discussed in the literature today. Some groups progressthrough five stages of group formation, whereas others may never progress beyondthe third stage. Forming is the initial stage when members of the team first meet each other. Mem- bers share information about themselves, learn about the purpose of the team, andbegin discussion about goals. The work of the team does not start during this phase.Forming can be considered the \"testing and orientation\" stage (Tuckman, 1965).Members look to the leader for direction and avoid controversial topics or chal-lenging anyone's ideas. Everyone is focused on getting along. During the formingstage, nurse leaders and managers help direct the team and assist members in understanding the purpose. Storming occurs as the team begins to work together. Members share their opin- ions about how to get the work of the team accomplished, and a lack of unity commonly results as the team becomes polarized. Intragroup conflict occurs, and,sometimes, the team never progresses beyond this stage. Storming can be charac-terized as \"conflict and polarization around interpersonal issues\" (Tuckman, 1965).To move beyond this stage, the group must adopt a problem-solving mentality andlet go of any personal agendas or goals. When the team is in the storming phase,nurse leaders and managers must remain positive about the work of the team, assistwith resolving conflict, and coach team members through the storm. Norming occurs once the team overcomes resistance and progresses through the storming phase. Everyone gives up individual goals and begins working as a teamtoward the common goal. Norming can be labeled as \"development of group cohe-sion\" (Tuckman, 1965). Group members begin to share ideas, and there is more acceptance among them. Focus becomes the work of the team. Creativity is high dur-ing this phase. Once the team is in the norming phase, nurse leaders and managersshould step back and allow the team members to take responsibility and accounta-bility for their work and progress toward the goal. Performing is the stage in which the members understand their roles, they are flex- ible, and group energy is channeled into meeting the goal. Members accept eachother's individual idiosyncrasies and develop group norms. The team is highlymotivated to accomplish the work during this phase. This stage is characterized as\"functional role-relatedness\" (Tuckman, 1965). The group becomes interdependentwith a strong group identity. At this point, nurse leaders and managers should notneed to be involved and can focus energy on other projects.318 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS 3021_Ch15_313-326 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 318Chapter 15 Building and Managing Teams 319 Adjourning occurs once the work of the group is completed. Although not identi- fied in Tuckman's original work, his subsequent work identified the notion that teams followed a life cycle model, which involved a distinct final stage (Tuckman& Jensen, 1977). The final stage can be emotional as the team disbands. When theteam is beginning to adjourn, nurse leaders and managers should celebrate theirsuccesses and provide recognition to each individual. Knowledge of group dynamics is critical for nurse leaders and managers to improve leadership competencies, facilitate team communication, and foster teamcohesiveness. Creating Synergy As teams are formed and transition into the \"norming\" phase, members becomeinterdependent and work together toward a common goal. Underlying this inter-dependence is the principle of synergy. Synergy catalyzes, unifies, and unleashesthe greatest strengths within people. Further, it fosters creativity, imagining, andintellectual networking (Covey, 2004, p. 265). Synergy can be described as combining strengths of members of a team to result in remarkable outcomes that would nothave been possible if members worked alone (Covey, 2004). Team synergy requiresmembers to value their own expertise as well as others' and enables team membersto be open-minded and willing to listen and learn from each other. Roussel (2013) identified six basic rules for effective nurse leaders and managers to sustain synergy when team building and working with teams: 1.Define a clear purpose or goal . Nurse leaders and managers need to describe the purpose or goal of the team clearly. Each team member must be knowledgeable about the reason they are together. The team members must be able to articulatethe goals, objectives, and purposes of the team. 2.Actively listening. Nurse leaders and managers must set the ground rules for meetings and ensure that members understand them. Only one member or theleader should be talking at any given time. Each team member must be focusedon each individual and listen to what is being said. Active listening is not judg-mental and means being completely absorbed and attentive to the speaker. 3.Maintain honesty . Nurse leaders and managers must model respect for others and encourage members to be open and honest. Each team member must be objective in providing feedback to the speaker. No one should make the speakerfeel belittled or that his or her views are not correct or important. 4.Demonstrate compassion. Nurse leaders and managers should encourage everyoneto participate and make it clear that everyone's opinion is valued. Each teammember should listen in a caring manner to the other's viewpoint. 5.Commit to resolution of conflicts . Nurse leaders and managers need to be open- minded and respect the opinions of each member of team. Each team membermust agree to disagree even though his or her view or opinion is not the same.Team members must work toward a common understanding and acceptance ofthe issue at hand. 6.Be flexible . Nurse leaders and managers must empower team members to share their voice and feel that they will be respected. Each team member must be open3021_Ch15_313-326 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 319and flexible to another individual's perspective. Everyone works together to accomplish the goal or objective. Nurse leaders and managers are key to successful teamwork. They must de- velop skills in intraprofessional and interprofessional team building and commu- nication. Further, they must model expert practice to team members and patients(ANA, 2016). CHARACTERISTICS OF EFFECTIVE TEAMS Teams must do more than merely complete tasks; the members must be able to interact, coordinate, cooperate, and embrace a shared understanding of the teamgoals and objectives, available resources, and constraints under which the teammust work (Salas, Sims, & Burke, 2005). The following characteristics of successfulteams were identified by Salas and colleagues (pp. 560-561): Team leadership involves the ability to direct and coordinate the activities of team members. It includes the following: assessing team performance; assigning tasks;developing team knowledge, skills, and abilities; motivating team members;planning and organizing; and establishing a positive atmosphere. All team mem-bers may lead the team once in a while. However, someone is needed to coordi-nate and support the work of the team. Mutual performance monitoring is the ability to develop common understandings of the team environment and apply appropriate task strategies to monitor teammember performance accurately. This is critical to success of the team. Everyoneneeds to be aware of other team members' work; as one team member completesa task, others need to step up and help, and this approach reflects the principleof backup. Backup behavior is the ability to anticipate other team members' needs through an accurate understanding of their responsibilities. This includes the ability to shiftassignments or tasks among members to achieve balance during high periods ofworkload or pressure. Adaptability is the ability to adjust strategies based on information gathered from the environment through the use of backup behavior and reallocation of teamresources. This also involves altering the course of action in response to internalor external changing conditions.320 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS LEARNING ACTIVITY 15-1 Am I a Team Player?

How did you score? 3021_Ch15_313-326 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 320Chapter 15 Building and Managing Teams 321 Team orientation is the ability to consider other team member's behaviors during group interactions, as well as the belief in the importance of the team goals over personal goals. Team members view their work as \"our work,\" not \"my work\"(Kalisch & Schoville, 2012). Shared mental models comprise an organizing knowledge structure of the relation- ships among the tasks the team is engaged in and how the team members will in-teract. \"Team members who have shared mental models have the same idea ofwhat needs to be done, by whom, and by when\" (Kalisch & Schoville, 2012, p. 53). Mutual trust is the shared belief that team members will perform their roles and protect the interests of their teammates. Team members must have trust in otherteam members that the work will be completed correctly and in a timely manner. Closed-loop communication is the exchange of information between a sender and a receiver irrespective of the medium. This type of communication is effectiveand efficient. Salas and colleagues (2005) described team leadership, mutual performance monitoring, backup behavior, adaptability, and team orientation as the five corecomponents that promote team effectiveness. They described shared mental mod-els, mutual trust, and closed-loop communication as coordinating mechanismsthat are critical to melding together the five core components. Team memberswho have shared mental models have an understanding of what needs to bedone, by whom, and by when (Kalisch & Schoville, 2012, p. 53). Team membersmust communicate effectively, and there must be shared trust to feel confidentthat team members will complete their work in a timely manner. Nurse leadersand manager have a role in fostering all of these characteristics to ensure optimalteam success. LEADING AND MANAGING TEAMS Nurse leaders and managers serve key roles within the professional practice setting, profession, health-care industry, and society (ANA, 2016). They model\"expert leadership practice to interprofessional team members and healthcareconsumers\" (ANA, 2016, p. 51). In fact, nurse leaders and managers are fundamental to building effective teams, but they may not always be the leaderof the team. Regardless of who the team leader is, the leader must facilitate the work of the team by using effective meeting skills and frequent remindersabout the team mission, goal, and accomplishments. LeBlanc (2014) suggests that the TEEAMS approach is one way in which nurse leaders and managers can create and lead successful teams. The key factors of TEEAMS are as follows: Time: Nurse leaders and managers must recognize the importance of spending adequate, quality, and face time with the team. LeBlanc suggests that schedulingregular time with staff members to round with them, engage in conversations,and get to know the team can be beneficial. 3021_Ch15_313-326 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 321Empowerment: Nurse leaders and managers must understand that empowerment is important to building a strong team. Empowering the team shows that nurse leaders and managers have trust in their team to make appropriate decisionswith minimal intervention: \"Productive teams are empowered teams!\" (LeBlanc,2014, p. 50). Enthusiasm: Nurse leaders and managers must be committed to the team's suc- cess and demonstrate enthusiasm for the individuals on the team as well as theteam as a whole. Enthusiasm is contagious and results in getting team membersexcited about the work and the team goals. Appreciation: Appreciation is meaningful recognition of a job well done. Everyone needs recognition for his or her work at times. Nurse leaders and managers mustshow appreciation to individuals for their work toward team goals. This appre-ciation builds team members' self-esteem and self-image. Improved self-esteemand self-image can be translated into improved patient outcomes, increased intraprofessional and interprofessional communication, and a willingness to continue to work toward organizational goals. Management: Managing teams and holding them accountable are major roles of nurse leaders and managers. Critical to these roles is ensuring that team membersare clear about their goals and understand job expectations and performance parameters. It is the nurse leader and manager's responsibility that staff membershave the resources necessary to perform their duties as individuals and as mem-bers of a team. Support: All nurses at all levels need support to accomplish their work. Nurse leaders and managers must support their team including their personal, profes-sional, and organizational needs. Strategies that nurse leaders and managers canuse to support staff members include being accessible, engaging in daily round-ing, promptly returning calls, and creating an atmosphere that encourages workengagement. Effective nurse leadership and management can have a positive impact on manager-staff relationships and team experiences, as well as enhance job satisfac-tion and promote staff retention. Nurse leaders and managers lead teams towardsuccess, encourage and mentor members, provide constructive criticism, and cele-brate success (Hader, 2013). Clinical nurses and nurse leaders and managers worktogether with the shared goal of safe and quality patient-centered care.322 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS LEARNING ACTIVITY 15-2 Complete the Group Effectiveness Assessment Think about a group you are involved with such as a study group or your clinical group.

C., Callaghan, M., Cooper, A. L., Brandman, J., & O'Leary, K. J. (2015). Assessing interprofessional teamwork inpatient medical oncology units. Journalof Oncology Practice , 11(1):19-22. Aim The aim of this study was to characterize teamwork among professionals in the in-patient oncology setting and to determine what barriers exist to establishingstrong interprofessional collaboration. Methods The investigators conducted a cross-sectional study in the hematology-oncologyservices of an academic hospital. All nurses, residents, fellows, and attendingphysicians on the units were invited to participate in the study. The Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ) was distributed to 193 eligible participants. Key Findings Of the participants, 129 (67%) completed the study. Teamwork scores differed significantly across professional types. Physicians, residents, and hospitalists rated their collaboration with nurses as high or very high. In contrast, nurses ratedcollaboration with physicians, residents, and hospitalists as poor. Barriers to collaboration were also scored differently. Nurses believed that negative communication among some professionals was the most significant obstacle to collaboration, whereas hospitalists identified difficulty reaching otherproviders as the major obstacle, and physicians rated teamwork and collaborationhighly and did not report any major barriers. Implications for Nurse Leaders and Managers Although this study was conducted in the oncology setting, the researchers indicatedthat previous studies conducted in other hospital settings found similar results.Nurse leaders and managers need to be aware of the possible differences in the perceptions of collaboration and teamwork of interprofessional team members and encourage effective communication among all health-care professionals. EXPLORING THE EVIDENCE 15-1 To sustain team synergy, nurse leaders and managers must lead meetings effec- tively. There is nothing more de-energizing than attending a mandatory meeting where there is not a clear purpose or agenda and the meeting seems to drift aim-lessly from topic to topic. Developing the competency of leading an efficient andsuccessful meeting is critical. First and foremost, nurse leaders and managers mustavoid holding unnecessary meetings. Typically, staff meetings and committee meet-ings are held monthly, and times may or may not vary. Best practice is to schedulemonthly staff meetings on the same day (i.e., the third Monday of the month) andthe same time (i.e., 7:30 a.m. for night shift staff and 7:30 p.m. for day shift). Com-mittee meetings or task force meetings are typically scheduled monthly also. 3021_Ch15_313-326 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 323Regardless of the type of meeting, an agenda should be prepared several days ahead of the meeting and sent to team members for review. This agenda informs members about what will be addressed and allows them to come to the meetingprepared. Meetings should begin and end on time. This shows team members thatthey are respected and their time is valued. Nurse leaders and managers shouldbegin with a statement of the purpose or goals of the meeting and establish groundrules. Taking control of the meeting from the beginning sets the tone and helps keepchit chat to a minimum, thus keeping the meeting on track. In addition, team mem-bers should be reminded to show respect for those presenting by actively listeningand refraining from checking telephone messages, texts, or e-mails. Throughoutthe meeting, the leader should encourage participation of team members. The meet-ing should be concluded by summarizing what was presented, describing the nextsteps or actions to be taken, and asking the team members whether they have anyquestions. Allow time at the end of the meeting for team members to talk about issues or concerns. A summary of the meeting should be sent out or made availableto the team shortly after the meeting. An example of a typical agenda for a nursingteam meeting is displayed in Table 15-1.324 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS Table 15-1 Staff Meeting Template DATE/TIME: PRESENT: Time Topic Presenter Nurse leader andmanager (or designee) Nurse leader and manager (or designee) Nurse leader and manager (or designee)Chair, QI teamChair, ProfessionalPractice team Nurse leader and manager (or designee) All Nurse leader and manager (or designee)Welcome Introductions Call meeting to order Signing of attendance sheet by everyone present Recognition of staff achievements Announcements for staff Budget report Brief presentation of budget information staff membersneed to know to help them with fiscal responsibility New policy presentation(s) Team project reports QI team Professional Practice team New business Presentation of anything new since the last meeting Open discussion The opportunity for staff to discuss issues and concerns Adjournment7:30 a.m.-7:35 a.m. 7:35 a.m.-7:45 a.m. 7:45 a.m.-8:15 -8:45 a.m. 8:45 a.m. -9:10 9:10 a.m. - 9:30 a.m.9:30 a.m. 3021_Ch15_313-326 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 324Chapter 15 Building and Managing Teams 325 SUMMARY Today, nurses must learn to work on intraprofessional and interprofessional teams to achieve the shared goal of delivering safe and quality care. Intraprofessionalteamwork contributes to overall nurse satisfaction, which in turn leads to saferand higher-quality care. To work in interprofessional teams requires a shift in thehealth-care culture of individual experts to a cooperative and collaborative teamenvironment. Team members integrate expertise and optimize care for patients.Nurses must be relentless in pursuing and fostering a sense of team and partner-ship across all health-care professions (ANA, 2010). Nurse leaders and managerscan positively impact the stability needed to accommodate the dynamics and com-plexity of the health-care system by collaborating with patients and families, intraprofessional and interprofessional colleagues, the community, and otherstakeholders to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. Nurse leaders and man-agers are critical to the development of successful work teams. A strong synergisticrelationship between staff members and nurse leaders and managers results insafe and quality patient-centered care.

Murray, PhD, RN, CNE KEY TERMS Break-even analysis budgetingLEARNING OUTCOMES Understand why budgeting is a critical skill for nurse leaders and managers. Examine issues nurse leaders and managers face when attempting to balance cost containment, cost effectiveness, and quality care. Define basic budget terminology. Explain the steps in the budget process. Describe different types of budgets. Compare and contrast different budgeting methods. In today's health-care delivery system, all nurses have a duty to provide value- added and cost-effective nursing care (Seifert, 2012), and there is added pressure to do so in keeping with the current trend to move to a value-driven budget process that focuses on patient-centered outcomes. In their ongoing commitment to the pro-fession, nurses should use \"their skills, knowledge, and abilities to act as visionaries,promoting safe practice environments, and supporting resourceful, accessible, andcost-effective delivery of health care to serve the ever changing needs of the popu-lation\" (American Nurses Association [ANA], 2010, p. 26). In addition, nurses mustparticipate in and lead efforts to minimize costs and unnecessary duplication ofservices as well as conserve resources. However, it falls to nurse leaders and man-agers to actually balance and align budgets. Nurse leaders and managers must 3021_Ch16_327-344 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 327become astute financial planners with a keen understanding of fiscal planning, budget forecasting, and cost containment. In turn, they have a tremendous amountof influence on costs related to managing personnel, supplies, and lengths of stay.In this chapter, nurse leaders and managers discover why budgeting skill is a nec-essary core competency, develop an understanding of how budgeting directly impacts patient safety, and learn the basics of the budgeting process. Knowledge, skills, and attitudes related to the following core competencies are included in this chapter: patient-centered care and informatics. BUDGETING AS A CORE COMPETENCY In any industry, including health care, the overall goal of the budgeting process isto gain high-quality value for every dollar spent (Porter-O'Grady & Malloch, 2013).Budgeting is an ongoing activity that requires nurse leaders and managers to de-velop fiscal literacy to monitor the financial status of a specific unit or units andultimately provide quality cost-effective nursing care. Nurse leaders and managersare responsible and accountable for operating and capital budgets as well as daily,weekly, and annual productivity. Nurse leaders and managers may be responsiblefor an individual cost center or several cost centers depending on their role withinthe organization. For example, the manager of a surgical intensive care unit is responsible for the cost center for just that unit; the director of critical care servicesis responsible for overseeing the cost centers of the surgical intensive care unit,medical intensive care unit, cardiac care unit, and cardiac telemetry unit; and the chief nursing officer is responsible for managing all nursing cost centers. Nomatter how many cost centers they oversee, nurse leaders and managers must haveadequate knowledge of the process to be effective. The main purpose of a nursing budget is to determine how to allocate the fiscal resources necessary to accomplish the objectives, programs, and activities of nurs-ing services; the budgeting process provides nurse leaders and managers with thenecessary tools to ensure that resources benefit patients and the organization, ratherthan being wasted (Finkler & McHugh, 2008; Swansburg, 1997). The budgetingprocess has a direct effect on the quantity and quality of the nursing care provided.Nurses at all levels should be involved in the budget process to ensure that ade-quate and appropriate resources are available to deliver safe, quality care. To budgeteffectively, nurse leaders and managers must develop specific knowledge in fiscalmanagement and financial outcomes and skills in budgeting and monetary man-agement (ANA, 2016). In addition, nurse leaders and managers must ensure thatresources are allocated \"to optimize the provision of quality, safe, and cost-effectivecare\" (ANA, 2016, p. 57). The American Organization of Nurse Executives (AONE) identifies financial management as a core competency for nurses in management or executive posi-tions. Financial management falls under the domain of business skills and includesthe following components (AONE, 2015, p. 10): Articulate business models for health-care organizations and fundamental concepts of economics.328 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS 3021_Ch16_327-344 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 328Describe general accounting principles and define basic accounting terms. Analyze financial statements. Manage financial resources by developing business plans. Establish procedures to ensure accurate charging mechanisms. Educate patient care team members on financial implications of patient care decisions. COST CONTAINMENT AND EFFECTIVENESS Nurse leaders and managers are charged with developing, implementing, evalu-ating, and monitoring a cost-effective budget. It is crucial for nurse leaders andmanagers to make sound fiscal decisions and spend their budgets wisely when itcomes to activities that affect safe and quality patient care, patient satisfaction, andnurse satisfaction (Swearingen, 2009). New policies and reimbursement structuresin the current health-care system directly impact the nursing budget. As the cost ofhealth care continues to rise, the health-care system is focusing more on improvingpatient outcomes, controlling costs, and providing financial rewards to health-careorganizations that can do both (Anderson & Danna, 2013). Nurse leaders and man-agers must be knowledgeable about the changing reimbursement based on quality.In fact, the link between quality performance measures and reimbursement requiresnurse leaders and managers to be vigilant in monitoring and increasing nurses'time delivering direct care when necessary (Swearingen, 2009). Nurse leaders andmanagers have a direct impact on patient care outcomes, the costs associated withpatient care, and the financial stability of the nursing unit or department. Effective nurse leaders and managers recognize that they have control over unit activities that contribute to the budget, such as supply costs and the amount of wastethat occurs. Further, expenditures and waste result from the actions of all individualsworking on the unit. Engaging staff members in the budget process and emphasiz-ing the financial impact on the unit when supplies are wasted or not charged canenable managers to maintain better control over the budget (Waxman, 2005). In fact,nurse leaders and managers have minimal success in controlling the budget withoutthe cooperation of all unit staff members (Finkler & McHugh, 2008). Although thereare aspects of the budget that managers cannot control, such as the amount of rev-enue generated, patient acuity, and benefit packages for staff (Waxman, 2005), nurseleaders and managers must focus time and energy on the areas they can control,rather than activities that are out of their reach. Technology and automation havehelped nurse leaders and managers manage the budget process and make informedcost-effective decisions. Tools such as variance reports, staffing spreadsheets, fore-casting software, and dashboards can help nurse leaders and managers oversee theunit budget, monitor trends, and make informed budget changes as needed. Although the implications of effective budgeting are important, budgeting is a complicated process that may not come naturally to all nurses. In turn, nurse lead-ers and managers must make it a priority to become experts in the basics of thebudgeting process to be able to advocate for and allocate resources for safe, timely,effective, efficient, equitable patient-centered care.Chapter 16 Budgeting Concepts 329 3021_Ch16_327-344 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 329THE BUDGET PROCESS A nursing budget is a systematic plan that provides the best estimate of nursing expenses and revenues, and it is most effectively stated in terms of attainable objectives. A prerequisite for the nurse leader and manager to setting a budget isunderstanding budget terminology and basic formulas. Basic budget terminologyand related formulas are listed in Table 16-1. The budget process can be compared to the nursing process (Marquis & Huston, 2012). Similar to the nursing care plan, the budget plan is expressed infinancial terms and carried out within a specific time frame. To deliver qualitycare, nurses must know how to develop and implement a nursing care plan. Inturn, nurse leaders and managers must know how to develop, implement, andmanage a budget plan (Anderson & Danna, 2013). To forecast a budget, it is necessary first to assess the current needs in terms of operating expenses, labor,supplies, and equipment. The second step is to diagnose or determine a cost-effective budget that maximizes the use of resources as well as ensures safe, qual-ity care. Third is to plan and develop a realistic budget. Implementing the budgetis the fourth step and includes ongoing monitoring and analysis of the monthlybudget to identify any variances. Finally, the last step is evaluation (Marquis & Huston, 2012). 330 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS Table 16-1 Basic Budget Terminology and Formulas Average daily census (ADC) Break-even quantityCost per unit of service (CPUOS) Full-time equivalent (FTE) Nursing hours per patient-day (NHPPD) costsper patientTotal staff numbers average hourly rate \u00d7hours per shift/ADC 1 employee working 8 hoursper day \u00d75 days \u00d752 weeks = 2,080 hours/year Productive nursing hours worked in 24 hours/patientcensus for 24 hoursOutput \u00d7 100 input Monthly budgeted expense -monthly actual expense =variance in $Variance in $/monthly budgeted expense = % of varianceThe average number of patients on theunit on any given day over a period of timeThe number of patients needed to breakevenTotal cost divided by units of service The equivalent of one full-time employee working for 1 year; can be a combinationof employees working part-time to equalone full-time employeeThe amount of productive nursing carehours per patient day in a 24-hour period Measure of the input required for the output Deviation from the projected budget Terminology Description Formula 3021_Ch16_327-344 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 330Assessment During the assessment phase, nurse leaders and managers must gather data and assess the needs for the upcoming fiscal year. This process includes determiningworkload and patient care hours, forecasting nonproductive work hours, estimat-ing costs of supplies and services, and projecting unit capital expenses. Addition-ally, nurse leaders and managers should examine the present nursing activities aswell as those planned for the future. Typically, expenses and revenues are analyzedfrom the previous fiscal year, and any deviations from the projected budget theprevious year are examined closely to avoid similar deviations in the future. Diagnosis The diagnosis phase involves determining the nursing productivity goal for theupcoming fiscal year. Productivity is related to the delivery of nursing care as wellas the effectiveness of that care relative to patient outcomes. Nurse leaders andmanagers must evaluate unit goals from the previous year to ensure that these goalsare in alignment with the organization's current mission and philosophy, and theymust revise or develop new goals for the future year if necessary. The projectedbudget is based on programs and activities needed to accomplish the nursing pro-ductivity goal as well as the organization's broader goals and fiscal projections. Planning A successful budget provides an annual plan that guides effective use of human andmaterial resources, nursing services, and management of the environment to improveproductivity. In addition, a good budget considers the needs of the unit as well asthe organization and places available resources in the appropriate places where theaccomplishment of goals will be greatest (Finkler, Jones, & Kovner, 2014). Budgetworksheets are used during the planning step to assist nursing leaders and managersin preparing their budgets. The planning stage is key to ensuring that patients receivecost-effective and safe nursing care from satisfied nursing staff members. Ideally, thebudget is somewhat flexible to allow for fluctuations in patient numbers and acuity. During the planning process, nurse leaders and managers may need to determine whether a program or service will lose money, make money, or break even. Theprocess used to determine the profitability of a service is called break-even analysis (Finkler & McHugh, 2008). Break-even analysis is useful in forecasting revenues fora specific unit or service. If total revenues are greater than total expenses, there is aprofit, and if total revenues are less than total expenses, there is a loss. When rev-enues are equal to expenses and there is not a profit or a loss, the program or servicewill just break even (Finkler & McHugh, 2008). In nursing, the break-even quantityis the number of patients needed to break even (see Table 16-3 for the formula tocalculate break-even quantity). The price is the cost for each patient or the averageamount collected per patient. When the variable costs per patient are lower than thebreak-even quantity, there is a loss, and when they are higher, there is a profit. Thebreak-even analysis is also useful to determine direct care hours for the nursing unit.Chapter 16 Budgeting Concepts 331 3021_Ch16_327-344 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 331Implementation On each unit, the nurse leader and manager directs, evaluates, and executes all budget-related activities. During implementation phase, the nurse leader and man-ager must attempt to keep the unit functioning within the budget plan. Prioritiza-tion is critical, and it is important for nurse leaders and managers to engage all staffmembers in the process and motivate them to work within the constraints of thebudget. To promote fiscal awareness among all nursing staff members, nurse lead-ers and managers should meet with staff early in the implementation stage to explain the budget or the upcoming year, discuss variances that occurred in theprevious budget year, and encourage input regarding any deviations. The more informed the staff members are about the budget goals and the plans to meet thosegoals, the more likely it is that the budget goals will be met. Evaluation The evaluation phase of the budget process begins once the budget is imple-mented and continues through the next year when a new budget is set. Becausethe nursing budget establishes the financial standards for the unit, nurse leadersand managers are accountable to address any deviations in the budget and takeappropriate action to avoid excess or inadequate money at the end of the budgetyear. Expense and revenue reports as well as comparisons between projectedbudget and actual budget are often provided to nurse leaders and managers bythe financial department on a regular basis, usually monthly and quarterly. During the evaluation phase, nurse leaders and managers must review reports ona regular basis for any deviations, or variances , from the projected budget. The actual results are compared with budgeted expectations and the difference between the two results in the variance and are analyzed to determine cause, withcorrective action taken when necessary. The goal of variance analysis is tostrengthen the accuracy of budget forecasting and minimize crisis managementwhen a deviation does occur (Porter-O'Grady & Malloch, 2013). Ideally, a flexiblebudget was set during the planning stage to allow for some variances on a monthlybasis. Should variances become significant, adjustments may be necessary. Variations occur most often in the areas of finances, staffing, and supplies (Porter-O'Grady & Malloch, 2013). Variances can be positive, meaning better thanexpected, or negative, meaning not as good as expected. Regardless of the type ofvariance, nurse leaders and managers must provide a written explanation to uppermanagement, explaining or justifying why the numbers are greater or less than thebudgeted amount; this amount can be a percentage or a dollar amount. Table 16-2illustrates a typical unit budget report for 1 month. Although all variances are important to analyze, staffing variances are typi- cally the greatest concern for nurse leaders and managers. Nurse leaders andmanagers vigilantly monitor the required number of nursing staff needed to carefor patients safely and compare those numbers with the actual nursing staffavailable. Staffing variances occur when there is a difference between requirednursing care hours and actual nursing care hours. A staffing variance can fall ateither end of the spectrum: not enough staff to care for patients safely or too332 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS 3021_Ch16_327-344 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 332many staff members scheduled for the number and acuity of patients on the unit. Nurse leaders and managers must analyze the causes of the individual staff vari-ances as well as variances in total nursing care hours (Porter-O'Grady & Malloch,2013). When variances become significant, strategies to avoid them in the futureshould be implemented and documented. In addition, nurse leaders and man-agers should monitor trends in variances to assist in addressing workload issues. Productivity As part of the ongoing evaluation of the budget, nurse leaders and managers mustmonitor productivity. Productivity is the ratio of output (e.g., products or services) to input (e.g., resources used). Output factors depend on the particular health-careagency and the type and frequency of services they provide (e.g., procedures, deliv-eries, clinic visits, admissions, home visits); output factors also include patient satis-faction and patient outcomes. Input factors include the skill level and experience ofstaff and can be impacted by patient acuity, unit layout, and nursing management.To maintain or increase productivity, the nurse leader and manager must examinefactors that affect both output and input, by keeping in mind that decreasing outputsor increasing inputs typically increases productivity. Productivity should ideally be the perfect blend of efficiency and safe care. Even small variations up or down can impact these factors. Consider the follow-ing example: If the standard of care is 6 nursing hours per patient day (NHPPD)and the census of the unit is 32 patients, then 192 hours of care per day areneeded to care for the patients. To reach 100% productivity, the nurse managerneeds 192 hours of care provided by his or her staff: 192 hours needed/192 hours provided \u00d7 100 = 100% productivity If the number of hours provided decreases for some reason, according to the equation, productivity actually rises: 192 hours needed/175 hours provided \u00d7 100 = 110% productivityChapter 16 Budgeting Concepts 333 solutions 2,250 (880) (79) 4,440 4,340 100Oxygen cannulas 550 500 50 9 2,200 2,310 (110)Suction catheters 750 600 150 20 3,000 3,100 (100)Sterile water 1,200 1,124 76 6.3 3,920 to-Date to-Date Budgeted Items Expense Expense in $ in % Budget Actual Variance *The monthly expenses for IV solutions and IV primary sets were higher than the budgeted expenses, with variances of ($1,378) o r (61.2%) and ($880) or (79%), respectively. However, the year-to-date actual and variance are within the budgeted expense. The nurse lea der and manager must explain this variance and identify causes of the overage to ensure that the overall budget for the year is met. IV, intravenous.3021_Ch16_327-344 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 333However, fewer hours of care provided will likely mean that the quality of care may not be adequate. If the hours provided are increased according to the following: 192 hours needed/200 hours provided \u00d7 100 = 96% productivity then, although the quality of care may be greater with more hours of care provided,productivity is decreased and therefore is less efficient. The key is finding a balancebetween safe, quality patient care and cost containment. Efficiency, or taking care not to waste resources such as supplies, equipment, and human capital, is obviously critical when considering productivity. Another impor-tant element is effectiveness, or providing care based on evidence and avoiding un-deruse and overuse of resources. Evaluating system inefficiencies and eliminatingoutdated processes can help increase effectiveness and efficiency (Porter-O'Grady& Malloch, 2013). When considering efficiency and effectiveness, nurse leaders andmanagers must take into account necessary care activities, value-added care activi-ties, and non-value-added care activities (Upenieks, Akhavan, & Kotlerman, 2008). Necessary Care Activities Necessary care activities are those activities that are \"essential in delivering patient care and do not directly benefit the patient\" (Upenieks, Akhavan, & Kotlerman,2008, p. 295). Calling primary care providers, transcribing orders, and documentingmedication administration are examples of necessary care activities. When nursesare engaged in necessary care activities, they are not providing patient care, yet theactivity is important to patient safety and quality care. Value-Added Care Activities Nursing activities that are performed by registered nurses (RNs), are patient-centered, and directly benefit the patient are considered value-added care activities (Upenieks, Akhavan, & Kotlerman, 2008). Some examples of value-added activ-ities, which are typically performed by RNs, include direct care activities such asthe following: assessment; taking of vital signs; wound care; medication admin-istration; communication with the patient, family, and care team; and care rounds.Indirect care activities that are also value added include chart review, handoffs,and care conferences (Upenieks, Akhavan, & Kotlerman, 2008). Non-Value-Added Care Activities Nursing activities that are performed by RNs and do not benefit the patient and arenot necessary to delivering patient care are non-value-added care activities (Upenieks, Akhavan, & Kotlerman, 2008). Non-value-added activities include looking forequipment or people, waiting for telephone calls, and waiting for patient transport.Such activities constitute wasted time that could possibly be avoided if systems andprocesses worked more efficiently (Storfjell, Ohlson, Omoike, Fitzpatrick, & Wetasin,2009). Nurse leaders and managers often overlook decreasing or eliminating non-value-added work when making adjustments for variances. Non-value-addedcare activities can lead to increased costs and nurse dissatisfaction, both of whichimpact patient safety and quality of care (Storfjell et al., 2009). 334 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS 3021_Ch16_327-344 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 334Chapter 16 Budgeting Concepts 335 Twigg, D.

Aim The aim of this study was to assess the economic impact of increased nursinghours of care on health outcomes in adult teaching hospitals. Methods This study had a longitudinal design with a retrospective analysis of a cohort of multiday-stay patients admitted to adult teaching hospitals in Perth, Australia.The investigators conducted a secondary analysis of data obtained in 2010 on hospital morbidity and staffing from September 2000 through June 2004 to analyzenursing-sensitive outcomes after implementing staffing using the nursing hoursper patient day (NHPPD) staffing method. Key Findings NHPPD increased from 3,466,811.84 registered nurse (RN) hours to 3,876,798.96RN hours after implementation. In all, 1,357 nursing-sensitive outcomes were prevented after implementation, including: 145 surgical wound infections 173 pulmonary failures 541 ulcers, cases of gastritis, episode of upper gastrointestinal bleeding 343 episodes of shock or cardiac arrest 155 cases of failure to rescue Based on the nursing-sensitive outcomes prevented, the investigators esti- mated that the net cost savings as a result of implementing the NHPPD staffingmethod was $12,108,948 Australian dollars, and the cost per life gained was$4,324 Australian dollars. Implications for Nurse Leaders and Managers Implementing the NHPPD staffing method resulted in increasing RN staffing and decreasing adverse nursing-sensitive outcomes. The findings of this study discount the common belief that increasing staffing is not cost effective. Nurseleaders and managers can use this type of research to support increasing staffingas a cost-effective patient safety intervention. The investigators emphasized thatthese results fall within the cost-effectiveness thresholds of the United States, theUnited Kingdom, and Sweden.EXPLORING THE EVIDENCE 16-13021_Ch16_327-344 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 335TYPES OF BUDGETS The budget process is basically the same, no matter the budget, and in fact, different budgets are needed for different purposes, although they are generally preparedat the same time because decisions about one type of budget may impact another.There are three major types of budgets that comprise a nursing budget: operatingbudget, personnel budget, and capital budget. Operating Budget The operating budget is the overall plan for a nursing department and accounts for expenses and revenues related to the day-to-day operation of the nursing unit for a fiscal year, which is a 12-month period that either typically coincides with thecalendar year or runs from July 1 to June 30. The operating budget includes all unitexpenses (e.g., costs related to providing care to patients) and revenues (e.g., incomefrom providing such services). Expenses Expenses include the total cost of running the nursing unit. The two main categoriesof expenses are as follows: personnel salaries, which include normal wages, over-time, paid holidays, benefits, shift differentials, and other paid time; and nonsalaryexpenses, which include medical and surgical supplies, office supplies, equipmentrental, and repair and maintenance of equipment. Expenses are typically broken down into line items, which represent specific categories of costs such as office supplies, surgical supplies, and medications. Common expenses or costs included in the operating budget are either fixed orvariable and can be direct or indirect: Fixed expenses do not change over the budget period, regardless of the volume of patients or activity level of the organization. Examples of fixed expenses includeadministrative salaries, rental or mortgage payments, insurance premiums, utilities, and taxes. Variable expenses fluctuate depending on patient volume and acuity or on activity level of the organization. Examples of variable expenses include patient care supplies, medications, linen, and food. If the number or acuity level of patientsincreases, more supplies, medications, linens, and food will be needed, resultingin higher variable expenses. The personnel budget is also an example of a vari-able expense because staffing can vary depending on the patient census and levelof acuity. Direct expenses directly affect patient care and include the costs of providing patient care. Examples of direct expenses include personnel salaries, medical andsurgical supplies, and medications. Indirect expenses are necessary for daily operations of the organization but do not affect patient care. Examples of indirect expenses include utilities, building main-tenance, and salaries of ancillary staff members such as security guards or parkingattendants. 336 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS 3021_Ch16_327-344 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 336Revenues Revenue is income from services provided and varies depending on the type of unit and organization. Although nursing is not considered a revenue-producing industry,revenue is generated and is projected for a nursing unit from the average daily census (ADC) or number of procedures done. Nursing revenue in a hospital is included with the room charges. However, nursing revenue can be generated inother ways, such as by patient visits or procedures (Anderson & Danna, 2013). Othersources of revenue can include grants, donations, gifts, third-party payers, Medicaid,Medicare, and income from gift shops, parking fees, and vending machines. Personnel Budget The personnel budget allocates expenses related to nursing personnel. This budget is part of the operating budget and is typically the largest budget in the organization.This budget is also very time-consuming to establish and manage. The personnelbudget is directly related to the ability of nurse leaders and managers to supervisetheir staff and requires vigilant monitoring of fluctuating patient census and acuityto avoid overstaffing or understaffing (Marquis & Huston, 2012). Nurse leadersand managers must consider the staffing needs and staffing plan for the unit whendeveloping the fiscal budget. The personnel budget includes expenses for regularsalaries, hourly differentials, overtime, and nonproductive time. To develop the personnel budget, nurse leaders and managers must consider some of the core staffing concepts introduced in Chapter 11. First, they must deter-mine the full-time equivalents (FTEs) needed to staff their unit to maintain safe,quality patient care for 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 52 weeks per year (Finkler& McHugh, 2008). An FTE position equals 40 work hours per week for 52 weeks ayear, or 2,080 hours per year. Next, the nurse leader and manager must forecast staffing needs based on the ADC. The ADC provides a measure of the unit activity and is calculated by averag-ing the census at midnight each day over a period of time. In forecasting FTEs, thenurse leader and manager must also consider staffing for days off and calculate non-productive time (i.e., paid time when staff members are not providing patient care)to determine an estimate of the number of FTEs needed to replace staff. Table 16-3illustrates how to calculate FTE requirements for nonproductive time. The steps forcalculating FTEs for a telemetry unit are illustrated in Box 16- 1. Once FTEs are determined, they must be converted to dollar values to make realistic cost-effective decisions in the budget process (Rohloff, 2006). When con-verting FTEs to costs, the hourly rate, shift differentials, projected overtime, andorientation time must be considered. Again, the nurse leader and manager refersto the previous year to forecast these additional labor costs. Finally, workload must be used as the basis for quantifying the productive hours needed to deliver nursing care. Workload is measured differently depending on theclinical setting (e.g., in the operating room, it is based on minutes per surgical case;and in home care, it is measured by the number of nursing visits per month). Althoughtools to measure workload in outpatient and ambulatory care centers are limited, numerous tools are available to measure workload in the acute care setting (Dickson,Chapter 16 Budgeting Concepts 337 3021_Ch16_327-344 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 337Cramer, & Peckham, 2010). How workload in acute care settings is measured varies depending on how the organization calculates workload measures and the type ofunit and agency. For example, in a hospital medical-surgical unit, workload may bebased on acuity by using a patient classification system (see Chapter 11). The ANANational Database of Nursing Quality Indicators provides an alternative to using patient acuity systems to determine staffing by instead using NHPPD. The measureis considered a reliable metric for establishing staffing and scheduling patterns (National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators, 2010). Figure 16-1 illustrates elements of NHPPD. Using NHPPD based on the previous budget year to forecaststaffing needs for the upcoming year is an appropriate and cost-effective approach(Porter-O'Grady & Malloch, 2013; Twigg, Geelhoed, Bremner, & Duffield, PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS BOX 16-1BOX 16-1 Determining Full-Time Equivalents Needed on a UnitDetermining Full-Time Equivalents Needed on a Unit Example: A 32-bed telemetry unit with an average daily census of 32 patients uses a nurse-to-patientratio of 1:4.

Over the past year, the unit has had an average daily census of 48. You staff your unit using nursing hours perpatient-day (NHPPD). Complete the following tasks: 1. Calculate the NHPPD. 2. Based on the NHPPD, calculate the full-time equivalents needed to staff the unit: Daily Weekly Monthly3021_Ch16_327-344 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 339Capital Budget The capital budget includes equipment, furniture, technology hardware and soft- ware, and building renovations, and it is separate from the operating and per- sonnel budget processes. The minimum value of a capital item can varydepending on the organization, and any item costing less than the minimum isconsidered a routine expense. Typically, items that are included in the capitalbudget have a minimum value of $1,000 and have an expected performance lifeof more than 1 year. To compile a capital budget, nurse leaders and managersshould seek input from staff to identify items that meet the cost limit and havea multiyear life. In addition, nurse leaders and managers must develop an understanding of the financial implications of leasing versus purchasing equip-ment, the expected life of equipment, and estimated costs of maintenance (Contino, 2004). Other considerations include projected patient needs, how thebudget will affect revenues and expenses, and funds available. Once the decisionis made regarding the needed capital items or assets, the request goes through a separate review and approval process at the organizational level (Finkler & McHugh, 2008). BUDGETING METHODS Different health-care organizations may use different budgeting methods. The typeof method is determined by the administration and aligns with the organization'smission and goals. The three common types of budgeting methods are incrementalbudgeting, performance budgeting, and zero-based budgeting. Incremental Budgeting Also called the flat-percentage method, incremental budgeting involves multiplying the current year's budget by a predetermined figure based on the cost of living,consumer price index, or inflation rate and then using that number to project forthe next fiscal year. The major advantages of incremental budgeting are that it isvery simple and it requires little expertise (Marquis & Huston, 2015). However,this method is inefficient and does not encourage prioritization of needs for thefuture, nor does it facilitate motivation to contain costs. Incremental budgetingis commonly used in determining household or personal budgets because thosebudgets are usually based on annual income and are adjusted according to increases in annual income. 340 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS LEARNING ACTIVITY 16-2 Comparing Budgets Describe the differences among an operating budget, a personnel budget, and a capital budget. What comprises each type of budget?3021_Ch16_327-344 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 340Performance Budgeting Performance budgeting emphasizes outcomes and results rather than activities and out- puts. Typical budgeting processes do not reflect goals related to cost-effectiveness, patient safety, and quality of nursing care. Performance budgeting, also called outcomebudgeting, can help determine the amount of money needed to provide value-addednursing care, non-value-added nursing care, and quality nursing care, as well as toensure patient and staff satisfaction and to control costs. Performance budgeting mea - sures multiple outcomes of the nursing unit. Rather than focusing on the resourcesused, it provides a picture of where resources are used and their relationship with thegoals of the nursing unit as well as the organization (Finkler & McHugh, 2008). Although performance budgeting can be time consuming, by using this method of budgeting, nurse leaders and managers can easily demonstrate quality of nurs-ing care and its relation to budget cuts. Performance budgeting evolves from theoperating budget and links outcomes to the consumption of financial resources. Zero-Based Budgeting In zero-based budgeting , nurse leaders and managers start the budget from zero each year as if each item or program was brand new. Zero-based budgeting requires nurseleaders and managers to prioritize and justify or rejustify requested funds meticu-lously on an annual basis. Supporting rationale must be provided for each plannedrevenue and expense. The goal is to have zero funds left at the end of the fiscal year.Therefore, rather than basing the budget on the past year, nurse leaders and managersare required to provide a rationale for all expenditures (Finkler, Jones, & Kovner,2014). The advantage of zero-based budgeting is that it forces managers to set prior-ities, avoid waste, use resources efficiently, and seek input from peers and staff in theprocess (Marquis & Huston, 2012). Zero-based budgeting also encourages commu-nication and coordination between managers and their staff. A major disadvantageof zero-based budgeting is that it is labor intensive. In addition, zero-based budgetingrequires nurse leaders and managers to have special training in the budget process. Zero-based budgeting uses decision packages to assist nurse leaders and man- agers in the process of prioritizing and justifying budget needs. The elements ofdecision packages include the following (Marquis & Huston, 2015, p. 216): Listing all current and proposed objectives or activities in the department Identifying alternative plans for carrying out activities Determining the costs of each alternative Identifying the consequences of continuing or discontinuing an activity SUMMARY The budget process is ongoing and cyclical, much like the nursing process. Whenplanning a budget, nurse leaders and managers are required to think ahead, anticipate changes, establish goals, and coordinate realistic plans. An importantChapter 16 Budgeting Concepts 341 3021_Ch16_327-344 14/01/17 3:51 PM Page 341342 PART III LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS element to the budgeting process is forecasting. Nurse leaders and managers must have a clear understanding of the following to manage their unit budgetseffectively: the budgeted ADC for the unit, the process the organization uses tomeasure unit productivity, the organization's policies, and the state regulations(Waxman, 2005). Involving staff nurses in the budget process helps them understand the rela- tionship between health-care costs and delivery of safe, quality patient care. Additionally, nurse leaders and managers who maintain transparency in thebudget process and encourage staff participation in managing cost-effectivework practices foster positive nurse outcomes. Nurse leaders and managers aswell as staff must engage in the process by identifying patient outcomes andeliminate interventions that do not add value to those outcomes. The budgetprocess is ongoing and requires all nurses to strive for cost containment withoutjeopardizing safe, quality patient care.

Identify strategies for professional growth. Discuss what it means to be a lifelong learner. Identify several self-care techniques to use when beginning a career in nursing. Today\u2014and in the years to come\u2014nurses have unique opportunities to influence health care in the United States and globally. The Institute of Medicine (2011) report The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health suggested that the envisioned future of health care is one that makes quality care accessible to the diverse populations of the United States, intentionally promotes wellness and disease pre-vention, reliably improves health outcomes, and provides compassionate care acrossthe life span (p. 2). To meet this envisioned future will require raising educationallevels and competencies of nurses and fostering intraprofessional and interprofes-sional collaboration to improve patient safety and quality of care. The Quality andSafety Education for Nurses (QSEN) initiative has gained momentum and is beingintegrated into nursing textbooks, accreditation and certification standards, and licensure examinations (Armstrong, 2010). Entry-level nurses are educated using a3021_Ch17_345-366 14/01/17 3:50 PM Page 346Chapter 17 Transitioning From Student to Professional Nurse 347 core set of nursing competencies to promote patient safety and quality care. How- ever, retention of new nurse graduates is a major issue for the profession that hasgrave consequences for nurse safety, patient safety, and quality of nursing care. This chapter outlines how nurses can develop a career plan for the future. Strategies for professional growth are also covered, as is what it means to be a lifelong learner.Finally, self-care techniques to use when beginning a career in nursing are discussed. Knowledge, skills, and attitudes related to the following core competencies are included in this chapter: teamwork and collaboration, evidence-based care, andinformatics. CAREER PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT The current job market is promising for new nurse graduates. According to theAmerican Nurses Association (ANA, 2014a), the percentage of job offers at the timeof graduation for nurses with a baccalaureate degree in nursing (BSN) is 59% com-pared with other college graduates (29.3%). A total of 1.13 million new registerednurses (RNs) will be needed by 2022 to fill new jobs and to replace retiring nurses(ANA, 2014a). Finding the right position at an organization where education is valued and advanced education is supported and promoted is essential to long-term successand job satisfaction as a nurse. The American Association of Colleges of Nursing(AACN, 2015) identified hallmarks or characteristics of the practice setting thatbest support professional nursing practice (Box 17-1). When present, these hall-marks allow baccalaureate and higher-degree nurses to practice to their full potential. These eight hallmarks are included in the AACN (2016) brochure What Every Nursing Student Should Know When Seeking Employment to assist nursing students and new nurse graduates in making the best decision on where to seekemployment following graduation. Preparing a Strategic Career Plan Besides considering where they want to work for their first nursing position, new nurse graduates should be preparing a strategic career plan before graduatingfrom nursing school. A strategic career plan is the roadmap to a nurse's success.The initial step in strategic career planning in nursing is developing specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely, or SMART, goals. Using the SMARTtechnique to outline a plan for the future can be valuable to new nurse graduatesas they begin career planning and development. Once goals are established, nursesshould identify specific action steps necessary to meet each goal and set a timelinefor completing each step. Before implementing the action steps, nurses need to takeinventory of available resources and consider who and what will help implementeach step. The last step is identifying the indicators of success. This step requiresnurses to determine the indicators that will help evaluate whether or not the goals were met (Donner & Wheeler, 2001). Career plans are dynamic and shouldbe reviewed and revised as personal and professional circumstances change. Careerplanning is important for nurses at all levels because it can be useful to evaluate anurse's present work situation and shape his or her future in the nursing profession. 3021_Ch17_345-366 14/01/17 3:50 PM Page 347348 PART IV MANAGING YOUR FUTURE IN NURSING BOX 17-1BOX 17-1 Hallmarks of the Professional Nursing PracticeHallmarks of the Professional Nursing Practice EnvironmentEnvironment These hallmarks are present in health-care systems, hospitals, organizations, or practice environments that: 1.Manifest a philosophy of clinical care emphasizing quality, safety, interdisciplinarycollaboration, continuity of care, and professional accountability. For example: The organization has a philosophy and missionstatement that reflect these criteria. Nursing staff members have meaningful inputinto policy development and operational management of issues related to clinical quality,safety, and clinical outcomes evaluation. Nurse staffing patterns have an adequate number of qualified nurses to meet patients'needs, including consideration of the complexityof patient care. Nursing is represented on the organization'sstaff committees that govern policy and operations. The organization has a formal program of performance improvement that includes a focuson nursing practice, safety, continuity of care,and outcomes. Nursing staff members assume responsibilityand accountability for their own nursing practice. 2.Recognize contributions of nurses' knowledgeand expertise to clinical care quality and patient outcomes. For example: The organization differentiates the practice rolesof nurses based on educational preparation, certification, and advanced preparation. The organization has a compensation and reward system that recognizes role distinctionsamong staff nurses and other expert nurses,(e.g., based on clinical expertise, reflective of nursing practice, education, or advanced credentialing). The organization's performance improvementprogram has criteria to evaluate whether nursingcare practices are based on the most current research evidence. Professional and educational credentials ofmembers of all disciplines, including nurses, arerecognized by title on name tags and reports. Nurses and members of other disciplines participate in media events, public relations announcements, marketing of clinical services,and strategic planning. Nurses are encouraged to be mentors to lessexperienced colleagues and to share their enthusiasm about professional nursing withinthe organization and the community. Advanced nursing roles, including clinical nursespecialists, nurse practitioners, scientists, educators, and other advanced practice roles,are used in the organization to support and enhance nursing care. 3.Promote executive level nursing leadership.For example: The nurse executive participates in the governing body. The nurse executive reports to the highest-leveloperations or corporate officer. The nurse executive has the authority and accountability for all nursing or patient care delivery, financial resources, and personnel. The nurse executive is supported by adequatemanagerial and support staff. 4.Empower nurses' participation in clinical decision making and organization of clinicalcare systems. For example: A decentralized, unit-based program or team organizational structure exists for decision making. Organization or system-wide committee andcommunication structures include nurses. Nurses have a demonstrated leadership role inperformance improvement of clinical care andthe organization of clinical care systems. A utilization review system is in place for nursinganalysis and correction of clinical care errorsand patient safety concerns. Staff nurses have the authority to develop andexecute nursing care orders and actions and tocontrol their practice. 5.Maintain clinical advancement programs basedon education, certification, and advancedpreparation. For example: Financial rewards are available for clinical advancement and education. Opportunities are available for promotion andlongevity related to education, clinical expertise,and professional contributions. 3021_Ch17_345-366 14/01/17 3:50 PM Page 348Developing a Resume A resume is a record of a nurse's education, employment history, accomplish- ments, and achievements. A well-designed and well-thought-out resume can help a new nurse graduate gain an advantage over others. As a new graduate, anurse should develop a resume that includes any work experience in health care,volunteer experiences, and special accomplishments during education such asawards and honors received, scholarly assignments, memberships in student organizations, and any leadership positions held. Keep in mind that every activity does not belong on the resume. In fact, most nurse leaders and managersspend approximately 30 seconds reviewing the typical resume (Hood, 2014).Therefore, a resume must present a concise picture of the nurse's strengths, Chapter 17 Transitioning From Student to Professional Nurse 349 BOX 17-1BOX 17-1 Hallmarks of the Professional Nursing PracticeHallmarks of the Professional Nursing Practice Environment\u2014cont'dEnvironment\u2014cont'd Peer review and patient, collegial, and managerial input are available for performanceevaluation on an annual or routine basis. Individuals in nursing leadership and manage-ment positions have appropriate education and credentials aligned with their role and responsibilities. 6.Demonstrate professional development supportfor nurses. For example: Professional continuing education opportunitiesare available and supported. Resource support exists for advanced educationin nursing, including registered nurse (RN)-to-Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) completionprograms and graduate degree programs. Preceptorships, organized orientation programs,retooling or refresher programs, residency programs, internships, or other educational programs are available and encouraged. Incentive programs exist for RN education for interested licensed practical nurses and non-nurse health-care personnel. Long-term career support program targeted to specific populations of nurses, such as older individuals, home care or operating room nurses, or nurses from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Specialty certification and advanced credentials are encouraged, promoted, and recognized. Advanced practice nurses (APNs), nurse researchers, and nurse educators are employedand used in leadership roles to support clinicalnursing practice. Linkages are developed between health-care institutions and baccalaureate or graduateschools of nursing to provide support for continuing education, collaborative research,and clinical educational affiliations. 7.Create collaborative relationships amongmembers of the health-care provider team. For example: Professional nurses, physicians, and other health-care professionals practice collaboratively andparticipate in standing organizational committees,bioethics committees, the governing structure,and the institutional review processes. Professional nurses have appropriate oversightand supervisory authority of unlicensed membersof the nursing care team. An interdisciplinary team peer review process is used, especially in the review of patient careerrors. 8.Use technological advances in clinical care and information systems. For example: Documentation is supported through appropriateapplication of technology to the patient careprocess. Appropriate equipment, supplies, and technologyare available to optimize the efficient delivery ofquality nursing care. Resource requirements are quantified andmonitored to ensure appropriate resource allocation.

A cover letter should always accompany the resume. The cover letter is how the nurse introduces himself or herself to the prospective employer.An effective cover letter is addressed to a specific person and includes the following: The reason the nurse is applying for a specific position A brief statement of the nurse's qualifications for the position, including strengthsand experiences related to the position A statement expressing appreciation to the prospective employer for consideration For an example of a cover letter for a new nurse graduate see Figure 17-2. Interviewing The interview process can be stressful for all nurses. To lessen anxiety, nursesshould prepare for the interview by learning about the organization ahead oftime. Seeking out the following information can be very helpful in preparing forthe interview and lessening anxiety: The organization's mission, vision, and philosophy (see Chapter 7 for more information) Accreditation status and Magnet status Length of orientation or residency program Nurse-to-patient ratio and professional practice model Whether the nursing service uses a shared governance model If unable to determine this information beforehand, the nurse should plan to ask about it during the interview. Preparing a few questions to ask during the interviewprocess is appropriate and shows forethought. In fact, asking thoughtful questionsspecific to the organization, unit, and position shows the prospective employer thatthe nurse has put forth effort to learn about the organization and is sincerely inter-ested in the position. Additionally, the nurse should plan to arrive to the interviewa few minutes early. It is a good idea to ask for clear directions to the facility, specificbuilding, and office where the interview will take place. If the interview is in anarea the nurse is not familiar with, visiting the site a few days before, identifyingthe building, and checking out the parking can be helpful. Professional dress is amust, as is comfort. This is not the time to be tugging on a jacket that does not fitproperly or limping because of blisters from new shoes.

The basic educa-tion of new nurse graduates \"cannot alone meet the requirements for the newlylicensed nurse to be confident and competent as they transition into his or herprofessional role\" (American Organization of Nurse Executives [AONE], 2010,para. 1). Factors such as the increasing complexity of health care, the nursingshortage, high-acuity patients, and the looming retirement of many experiencednurses support the critical need for the successful transition of new nurse grad-uates from the academic setting to the clinical practice setting. One of the recom-mendations of the IOM (2011) is to implement \"nurse residency programs toprovide nurses with an appropriate transition to practice and develop a morecompetent nursing workforce\" (p. 148). According to the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN, 2016), new nurses care for patients in a complex health-care environment and experiencehigh levels of stress that cause 25% of these nurses to leave a position within thefirst year of nursing practice. These factors negatively influence safe and qualitycare and result in poor health-care outcomes. In an integrative review, Rush andcolleagues (2013) found that transition to practice (TTP) programs that integrateformal and informal education, preceptorships, mentorships, and unit-specificorientations are significantly effective in retraining new nurse graduates. The NCSBN developed an evidence-based TTP program to ensure successfultransition from the academic setting to the practice setting. The model integrateseducation, practice, and regulations for successful transition from the classroomto the clinical practice setting and beyond (NCSBN, 2016). Current research suggests that residency programs can reduce turnover rates in the first year of practice and promote growth in clinical decision making andleadership skills (Al-Dossery, Kitsana, & Maddox, 2013). Spector and colleagues(2015) conducted a study to examine the impact of the NCSBN TTP program onquality and safety and new nurse graduate stress, competence, job satisfaction,and retention. These investigators found that a substantial improvement in qual-ity and safety outcomes as well as in self-reported stress, competence, and jobsatisfaction. AONE (2010) has made a commitment to the success of new nurses by develop- ing guiding principles for new nurses' transition to practice. The guidelines recog-nize the importance of the successful transition of new nurses to promote qualityoutcomes (Box 17-2). Moreover, the principles outline the importance of the nurseleader and manager's support for the transition, the need for preceptors with astrong desire to teach and coach new nurses, the value of strategies for stress man-agement, and effective policies and procedures related to zero tolerance of lateralviolence (AONE, 2010). Nurse leaders and managers are vital to the success of TTP programs. They pro- vide support for knowledge acquisition and build new nurse graduates' confidencein skills (D'Addona, Pinto, Oliver, Turcotte, & Lavoie-Tremblay, 2015). In addition,nurse leaders and managers are critical in the socialization of new nurse graduatesby providing a safe environment where new nurses can share concerns and receivesupport. Chapter 17 Transitioning From Student to Professional Nurse 353 3021_Ch17_345-366 14/01/17 3:50 PM Page 353PRECEPTORS AND MENTORS An effective orientation program can be critical to retaining new nurses. The most common form of orientation program for new nurse graduates involves the use ofpreceptors. Typically, a preceptor is a staff nurse who is recognized for his or her clinical competence, leadership abilities, organizational skills, and desire to orientnew nurse graduates. The role of the preceptor is to ensure that the new nurse graduate expands his or her basic nursing education and further develops theknowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to function competently in the nursingposition. The preceptor serves as a role model as well as provides the new nursegraduate an orientation to the unit, socialization within the unit culture, assistancewith skill mastery, and a resource regarding policies and procedures. The new nurse graduate typically demonstrates marginally acceptable perform- ance as an advanced beginner, according to Benner's (1984) Novice-to-Expertmodel. The competent nurse, the third stage of Benner's model, is an appropriatepreceptor for the novice or advanced beginner (NCSBN, 2016) because he or sheexperiences a sense of mastery in the clinical setting and can discern relevant fromirrelevant assessment data (Benner, 1984). Different from a preceptor, a mentor is an experienced individual (who may or may not be a nurse) who is willing to maintain a long-term relationship, empow-ering, nurturing, advising, and guiding the new nurse graduate throughout his orher professional career (Masters, 2014). The mentoring relationship can benefitnurses at all levels, not just new nurse graduates. When selecting a mentor, nurses354 PART IV MANAGING YOUR FUTURE IN NURSING BOX 17-2BOX 17-2 American Organization of Nurse Executives GuidingAmerican Organization of Nurse Executives Guiding Principles for the Newly Licensed Nurse's TransitionPrinciples for the Newly Licensed Nurse's Transition Into Practice Into Practice Commitment for newly licensed nurse transition into practice occurs across all levels of the organization: Senior leadership Nursing leadership Peers Medical staff Interdisciplinary colleagues The nurse manager must achieve and is account-able for the leadership competencies that supportthe transition of the newly licensed nurse into his or her professional role. Preceptors demonstrate professional competency and have a strong desire to teach, coach, and mentor. Preceptors are prepared and supported by qualifiednurse educators. A structured transition into practice occurs in allsettings and for all levels of academic preparation: A continuous focus on evidence-based tech-niques and outcomes that foster patient safetyand quality is evident throughout the transitionprocess. Widely diverse ages, ethnicity, backgrounds, and experiences of new graduates are taken intoaccount when developing educational, social, and cultural supports. The transition process is customized to the specific individual and practice area. Social affiliation supports are in place to mitigatethe emotional stressor role. Organizations have in place policies and practices related to zero tolerance of lateral violence. Posttransition support programs are in place to aid in the retention of the newly licensed nurse. Collaborative relationships exist with academic institutions that support dialogue to address preparation for practice gaps. From AONE, 2010. 3021_Ch17_345-366 14/01/17 3:50 PM Page 354should consider someone who is easy to communicate with and willing to commit time to the mentoring relationship. \"All nurses have a responsibility to mentorthose who come after them, whether by helping a new nurse become oriented or by taking on more formal responsibilities as a teacher of nursing students or a preceptor\" (IOM, 2011, p. 244). An effective mentor inspires and challenges thenew nurse to a high level of professionalism. The mentoring relationship can bemutually beneficial and result in growth for both the new nurse and the mentor(Grossman & Valiga, 2013). STRATEGIES FOR PROFESSIONAL GROWTH Nurses today cannot stop learning just because they have earned their degree, attained licensure, and become working nurses (Johnson, 2015). Health care is rap-idly changing and requires nurses to keep up with those changes to provide safeand quality care. Patients deserve to have highly competent nurses who are adeptat caring for them across all settings (IOM, 2011). For nurses to thrive in this com-plex environment, they must be committed to lifelong learning. It is imperativethat nurses maintain current knowledge by reading professional journals, attendingcontinuing education offerings, and seeking certification in their specialties to en-hance and validate their knowledge and skills in clinical practice (Johnson, 2015). Competence is situational and dynamic and requires performing at an expected level that integrates knowledge, skills, attitudes, and nursing judgment (ANA, 2015c, p. 44). Nurses must attain and maintain competencies after graduating from nurs-ing school. Competence is both an ongoing process and an outcome (ANA, 2014b,2015c). Therefore, attaining and maintaining competence are important. Being acompetent nurse has both legal and ethical implications. \"The ability to perform atthe expected level requires a process of lifelong learning. Registered nurses mustcontinually reassess their competencies and identify needs for additional knowl-edge, skills, personal growth, and integrative learning experiences\" (ANA, 2015c,p. 45). Competence affects not only the safety and quality of care but also self-respect, self-esteem, and meaningfulness of work (ANA, 2015a). Ensuring that nurses maintain competence is the shared responsibility of the pro- fession, individual nurses, professional organizations, regulatory agencies, creden-tialing agencies, and nurse leaders and managers (ANA, 2010, 2014b). Nurse leadersand managers must be committed to providing an environment that is conducive tocompetent nursing practice. \"Employers who provide opportunities for professionaldevelopment and continuing education promote a positive practice environment inwhich nurses can maintain and enhance skills and competencies\" (ANA, 2015c, p. 47). In essence, nurses at all levels must embrace a culture of nursing competence,a culture in which shared beliefs, attitudes, and values promote lifelong learning result in an environment of safe and quality care (Porter-O'Grady & Malloch, 2013). Becoming a Lifelong Learner Inherent in the ability to provide competent, safe, quality nursing care is a commit-ment to lifelong learning. A lifelong learner is one who seeks continuing education opportunities to increase his or her knowledge and skills and improve his or herChapter 17 Transitioning From Student to Professional Nurse 355 3021_Ch17_345-366 14/01/17 3:50 PM Page 355attitudes throughout his or her professional and personal life. According to Provi- sion 5.1 of the ANA Code of Ethics for Nurses With Interpretive Statements , nurses have a responsibility to maintain competence and continuation of professional growth,which requires a commitment to lifelong learning (ANA, 2015a). In an address toher nursing students in May, 1872, Florence Nightingale said: For us who Nurse, our Nursing is a thing, which, unless in it we are making progress every year, every month, every week, take my word for it we are going back. . . . The more experiencewe gain, the more progress we can make. The progress you make in your year's training with usis as nothing to what you must make every year after your year's training is over. . . . A womanwho thinks in herself: \"Now I am a 'full' Nurse, a 'skilled' Nurse, I have learnt all that there isto be learnt\": take my word for it, she does not know what a Nurse is, and she never will know;she is gone back already. . . . Conceit and Nursing cannot exist in the same person, any morethan new patches on an old garment. . . . Every year of her service a good Nurse will say: \"I learn something every day.\" (Florence Nightingale to her nurses, 1914, p. 1) . Lifelong learning includes learning about new concepts, issues, and controversies relevant to evolving nursing practice. Learning can occur through many activities such as continuing education, networking with colleagues, reading professional literature, achieving specialty certification, and pursuing advanced degrees in nursing (ANA, 2015a). To attain and maintain the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary for pro- fessional practice, nurses must engage in continuous formal, informal, and reflec-tive learning activities (ANA, 2014b). Formal learning occurs through engaging instructured, academic, and professional development activities, whereas informallearning is related to the experiential learning that occurs in the workplace, com-munity, and home settings (ANA, 2014b). According to the ANA, reflective learning \"represents recurrent thoughtful personal self-assessment, analysis, and synthesisof strengths and opportunities for improvement\" (2014b, p. 4). Weaknesses and opportunities identified through reflective learning should be what drive a nurse'splan for career development and lifelong learning. Continuing Education Once licensed, RNs must maintain current licensure to continue nursing practice.Depending on the state, the requirements for license renewal may include renewalfees, current work address, current home address, notification of criminal activities,and proof of a specific number of continuing education hours. Nurses attain andmaintain competencies during their professional career through continuing education activities. Continuing education is often provided by hospitals, commu-nity agencies, professional organizations, and professional meetings and can beprovided in various formats (i.e., face to face, online, self-study, conferences, work-shops, and seminars). The American Nurses Credentialing Center is responsiblefor accrediting standards of continuing education programs and courses. Contin-uing education credits reflect the length of programs. One credit of continuing education is equivalent to 50 minutes. In some states, university and college course-work may meet continuing education requirements. Different states may have different numbers of continuing education hours required for license renewal.356 PART IV MANAGING YOUR FUTURE IN NURSING 3021_Ch17_345-366 14/01/17 3:50 PM Page 356Nurses can find a summary of each state's renewal requirements on the NCSBN Web site, available at www.ncsbn.org/contact-bon.htm. Specialty Certification Specialty certification validates specific knowledge, skills, and attitudes demon- strated by a nurse in a specialized area of practice (Box 17-3). Certified nursesare role models of professional accountability (Altman, 2011). By becoming cer-tified, nurses demonstrate they are responsible for their own practice by seekingfurther education and being motivated to provide high-quality nursing care. In addition, nurses who continually renew their certification demonstrate their commitment to increasing their knowledge in their nursing specialty (Foster, 2012). Nurse leaders and managers prefer to hire certified nurses if possible because they have a proven knowledge base, documented experience in their clinical specialty, and a demonstrated commitment to lifelong learning and career advance-ment (Altman, 2011; Stromborg, Niebuhr, & Prevost, 2005). In addition, researchsuggests that specialty certification improves patient safety outcomes (Boltz,Chapter 17 Transitioning From Student to Professional Nurse 357 BOX 17-3BOX 17-3 Specialty CertificationsSpecialty Certifications NURSE PRACTITIONER (NP) CERTIFICATIONS Acute Care NP Adult NPAdult-Gerontology Acute Care NPAdult-Gerontology Primary Care NPAdult-Psychiatric-Mental Secic, 2013; Kendall-Gallagher & Blegen, 2009). Nurse leaders and managers can promote certification by seeking certificationthemselves and advocating for organizational support for certification such as financial incentives, public recognition, and including credentials on name tags.Specialty certification has a positive impact on staff, patients, and the organization(Altman, 2011).358 PART IV MANAGING YOUR FUTURE IN NURSING Boltz, M., Capezuti, E., Wagner, L., Rosenberg, M., & Secic, M.

Aim The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between nurse certifica-tion and unit-level nursing-sensitive quality indicators that primarily serve olderadults. Methods A descriptive retrospective design and multivariate regression technique wereused to study units involved in the Nurses Improving Care for Health systemElders (NICHE). The sample included 35 medical units and 9 medical-surgicalunits in 35 hospitals. The investigators collected data on the following: Nurse certification: the percentage of RNs certified in any specialty and the percentage certified by the American Nurses Credentialing Center in Geronto-logical Nursing Nursing-sensitive unit-level quality indicators from the previous quarter includingpatient fall rates, patient falls with injuries, presence of pressure ulcers, and use of restraints Unit-level data such as RN staffing, nursing care hours per patient-day, skillmix, percentage of RNs with bachelor's degrees, and percentage of RN hourssupplied by contract or agency nurses Key Findings The researchers found a significant inverse relationship between nurse certificationand fall rates (p = 0.05) but no significant relationship between nurse certificationand falls with injury, pressure ulcers, and use of restraints. The investigators discussed the small sample size as a limitation and the reason for the lack of significant findings. Implications for Nurse Leaders and Managers The researchers concluded that nursing-sensitive outcomes in hospitalized older adults may be affected by nurse certification. Nurse leaders and managersshould consider nurse certification as a strategy to improve patient outcomes in hospitalized older adults. Further, certification can promote nurse satisfaction.EXPLORING THE EVIDENCE 17-13021_Ch17_345-366 14/01/17 3:50 PM Page 358Advanced Degrees Safe and quality care depends on nurse leaders and managers hiring a well-educated workforce. Research indicates that care provided by nurses at the baccalaureate leveland higher results in lower mortality rates, fewer medication errors, and better patient outcomes (AACN, 2014). In its report The Future of Nursing, the IOM recog- nized that associate degree nurses are essential for the current health-care system.However, the IOM recommended that 80% of all nurses obtain a baccalaureate degree or higher by 2020 and that the number of nurses with doctorates double by2020 (IOM, 2011). Increasing the percentage of baccalaureate-prepared nurses to 80%by 2020 is \"necessary to move the nursing workforce to an expanded set of compe-tencies, especially in the domains of community and public health, leadership, sys-tems improvement and change, research, and health policy\" (IOM, 2011, p. 173). TheTri-Council for Nursing, an alliance of the AACN, ANA, AONE, and the NationalLeague for Nursing, contend that more nurses with baccalaureate and higher degrees in nursing are needed to provide safe, quality care needed in the currentand future complex health-care system (Tri-Council for Nursing, 2010). Nurse leaders and managers play a pivotal role in the educational future of nursing. First and foremost, nurse leaders and managers must seek advanced de-grees themselves. Next, nurse leaders and managers must support other nurses who want to pursue further education. The AACN encourages nurse leaders andmanagers to \"foster practice environments that embrace lifelong learning and offersincentives to nurses seeking to advance their education to the baccalaureate and higher degree levels\" (AACN, 2014, para. 2). Nurse leaders and managers canbecome involved at the organizational level by spearheading initiatives to establishor increase tuition reimbursement programs for nurses with a desire to return toschool and other staff members who are pursuing additional education in nursingor another health-care field. Contributing to the Nursing Profession Membership in professional nursing organizations can provide many opportu-nities to contribute to the profession. Part of being a professional is belonging to a professional organization. Nursing professional organizations are vital tothe profession today and in the future. Members of professional organizationswork collectively to \"define and promote standards of behavior and practice\"(Beyers, 2013, p. 388). The primary roles of professional organizations include professional develop- ment, advancing the profession, developing and promoting health-care policy,and advocacy for members and consumers of health care. All nurses at all levelsmust contribute to \"the advancement of the profession through knowledge development, evaluation, dissemination, and application to practice\" (ANA,2015c, p. 27). In fact, nurses are expected to use current research and evidence intheir practice. Nurses should also contribute to the profession by leading andserving on institutional or health policy committees. Nurse leaders and managersshould participate in the promotion and implementation of health policies. Nurseleaders and managers are responsible to ensure that the organization supportsChapter 17 Transitioning From Student to Professional Nurse 359 3021_Ch17_345-366 14/01/17 3:50 PM Page 359nursing research and evidence-based practice. They must become involved at the administrative level to promote and create processes and structures that are conducive to scholarly inquiry (ANA, 2015a). In addition, nurse leaders and man-agers should promote communication of information and advancement of theprofession through writing, publishing, and presentations for professional or layaudiences (ANA, 2016). Nurse leaders and managers are also responsible for pro-moting the advancement of the profession by participating and encouraging staffparticipation in professional organizations. BALANCING PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL LIFE Nurses at all levels are responsible for delivering high-quality, safe, patient carein a complex health-care environment. To be able to meet this responsibility consistently, nurses \"must have the capacity to fully engage and to be fully pres-ent in their practice and in their life\" (Interprofessional Institute for Self-Care,n.d., para. 1). Nurses are very focused on caring for others, often to their owndetriment. Caring for others before oneself can result in an environment thatsaps energy and jeopardizes personal health. What many nurses do not under-stand is that caring for oneself is foundational to being able to care for others(Cranick, Miller, Allen, Ewell, & Whittington, 2015). Self-care is \"choosing behaviors that balance the effects of emotional and physical stressors. These behaviors can include exercising, eating nutritious foods, getting enough sleep,practicing self-centering activities, abstaining from substance abuse, and pursu-ing creative outlets\" (Richards, Sheen, & Mazzer, 2014, p. 3). Nurses have a dutyto take care of their own health and safety just as they care for their patients(ANA, 2015c). Provision 5 of the ANA Code of Ethics for Nurses With InterpretiveStatements states \"the nurse owes the same duties to self as to others, including the responsibility to promote health and safety, preserve wholeness of characterand integrity, maintain competence, and continue personal and professionalgrowth\" (ANA, 2015a, p. 19). Sadly, many nurses easily become trapped in anunhealthy cycle of putting others before themselves and depleting their energyand time for self-care. The resulting fatigue from the lack of self-care is linkedto an increased risk of errors, memory deficits, impaired mood, miscommunica-tion, and overall poor performance that can jeopardize patient safety and qualityof nursing care (ANA, 2014a). Personal wellness is important. Nursing students should begin self-care during their educational program. Habits developed early in one's career can have last-ing effects. According to the ANA, a healthy nurse is \"one who actively focuses on creating and maintaining a balance and synergy of physical, intellectual, emo-tional, social, spiritual, personal, and professional wellbeing. A healthy nurselives life to the fullest capacity, across the wellness/illness continuum, as they become stronger role models, advocates, and educators, personally, for theirfamilies, their communities and work environments, and ultimately for their patients\" (ANA, 2015b, para. 1). Being healthy is not only important for nurses,it is also important for the quality of nursing care (Letvak, 2012). Nurses at all360 PART IV MANAGING YOUR FUTURE IN NURSING 3021_Ch17_345-366 14/01/17 3:50 PM Page 360levels have a responsibility to engage in evidence-based self-care strategies to reduce the risk of fatigue. Richards and colleagues (2014) suggest that self-careshould focus on six areas (Richards et al., 2014): 1.Physical self-care: \"Physical self-care includes proper nutrition, emphasizing dis- ease prevention and management, regular cardiovascular and strength building exercise, adequate sleep and rest, and an understanding of personal self-careroutines\" (p. 9). 2.Mental self-care: \"Mental self-care focuses on flexibility, stress-reducing practices, open-mindedness, and constant learning: these are the pillars of a healthy mentalenvironment\" (p. 17). 3.Emotional self-care: Emotional self-care involves identifying where unresolved emotional pain is eroding self-care and focuses on understanding inaccuracies,challenging negative beliefs, and changing how one thinks (p. 25). 4.Spiritual self-care: Spiritual self-care is a reflection of the belief in a higher power that provides a connection to the universe. Beliefs may or may not bebased in organized religion, but the spirit reflected is unique to the individual(p. 27). 5.Relationship self-care: An individual's life is affected, either positively or nega- tively, by the quality of the relationships in which they are involved. Self-carecan be challenged by toxic relationships. Therefore, to be a healthy nurse mayrequire eliminating toxic people from one's life (p. 29). 6.Choice self-care: When nurses make choices from self-compassion, the choices are in line with core values. Choosing to create a life of improved self-care may takesome work, but nurses will have a renewed sense of freedom (p. 30). Nurses at all levels should model health maintenance and health promotion measures for their patients, seek health care when needed, and avoid unnecessary health or safety risks in personal and professional activities (ANA, 2015c). Nurse leaders and managers have an ethical responsibility to foster balance within their units by promoting healthy lifestyles and encouraging nurses to maketime for self-care (ANA, 2015c; Cranick et al., 2015). The ANA identifies five healthyconstructs that are important to foster a work environment conducive to supportinghealthy nurses (ANA, 2015a, p. 24): 1.Calling to care: Caring is the interpersonal, compassionate offering of self by which the healthy nurse builds relationships with patients and their families. 2.Priority to self-care: Self-care and supportive environments enable the healthy nurse to increase the ability to manage the physical and emotional stressors ofthe work and home environments effectively. 3.Opportunity to role model: The healthy nurse confidently recognizes and identi- fies personal health challenges in himself or herself and in the patients, therebyenabling the nurse and the patients to overcome these challenges in a collabo-rative, nonaccusatory manner. 4.Responsibility to educate: Using nonjudgmental approaches, considering adult learning patterns and readiness to change, the healthy nurse empowers himselfChapter 17 Transitioning From Student to Professional Nurse 361 3021_Ch17_345-366 14/01/17 3:50 PM Page 361or herself and others by sharing health, safety, and wellness knowledge and skills, resources, and attitudes. 5.Authority to advocate: The healthy nurse is empowered to advocate on numerous levels including personally, interpersonally, within the work environment andthe community, and at the local, state, and national levels in policy developmentand advocacy. Nurse leaders and managers should implement evidence-based policies, pro- cedures, and strategies that promote healthy work schedules, improve alertness, and discourage nurses from working extra hours that may contribute to fatigue(ANA, 2014a, p. 5). 362 PART IV MANAGING YOUR FUTURE IN NURSING Cranick, L., Miller, A., Allen, K., Ewell, A., & Whittington, K. (2015). Does RN perception of self-care impact job satisfaction? Nursing Management , 46(5), 16-18. Aim The purpose of this study was to determine whether engaging in self-care has apositive impact on a nurse's level of job satisfaction. Methods A descriptive study was conducted using an online survey that was emailed to RNsworking in a rural multihospital system to determine the relationship of how nursesfeel about their participation in self-care with their personal feelings of job satisfac-tion. The questionnaire included four categories of questions: interpersonal relation-ships with other nurses, nurses' assessments of their own ability to perform the jobeffectively, personal feelings about how the organization promotes self-care, and personal habits regarding self-care and well-being in their private lives. Key Findings The investigators reported that 182 RNs responded to the survey. A positive corre-lation was found between a nurse's job satisfaction and the amount of self-careparticipated in each week. In addition, there was a significant correlation with various factors related to job satisfaction such as experiencing anxiety (p 0.01), looking forward to coming to work (p 0.01, and being in a good mood while at work (p .0.01). However, only 4.42% of the participants indicated that they were satisfied with their organization's efforts to promote self-care. Implications for Nurse Leaders and Managers Nurse leaders and managers must understand that job satisfaction is one deter-minant of nursing turnover and that higher job satisfaction can have a positiveimpact on patient outcomes. Two strategies supported by this study are reinforc-ing healthy lifestyles for nurses and encouraging self-care attitudes and methodsin the workplace. Nurse leaders and managers should assist staff in recognizingthe importance of self-care and encourage staff members to support each other toensure uninterrupted break times. EXPLORING THE EVIDENCE 17-23021_Ch17_345-366 14/01/17 3:50 PM Page 362FUTURE DIRECTIONS Conceptualizing the future can be difficult and demanding. In a classic article by Henchey (1978), four types of futures are presented, each with different charac-teristics and purposes. Interestingly, they are still relevant to consider today. The plausible future , or what could be, focuses on what may occur based on current and projected trends. The probable future is what will likely occur and actually reflects the present state with minimal changes. Looking at the probable futureis the catalyst that motivates people to want and explore possible futures(Henchey, 1978). The possible future , or what may be, considers all possible situa- tions that could occur. The possibilities inspire people to explore the perfect futureor what Henchey calls the preferable future. The preferable future is what should be and begins with a vision and a roadmap to get there. Nurses and nurse leadersand managers can shape the preferable future. The preferred future is one in which nurses provide safe, quality care in a healthy work and optimal healing environment. The Lucian Leape Institute (2013)described the future healthy and safe workplace: Innovation, critical thinking, and technological and scientific advancement would be intrinsic to the work, without loss of compassion and relationship. Each day, all members of the workforcewould learn something new and experience a sense of meaning and joy. All members of the workforce would be able to identify their contributions to the minute. Management would hold workforce safety and experience as a non-negotiable requirement. . . . Patients and familieswould participate as partners in their care. They would enter the health care organization witha sense of relief and confidence that they would be respected, cared for, and safe in the hands ofinspired care teams who clearly find their work meaningful (pp. 22-23). Nurse leaders and managers can contribute significantly to this preferred future by honoring and respecting staff and protecting the physical, psychological, and emotional safety of these staff members. This culture of respect creates joy andmeaning in the workplace, which results in safe and quality health care. Nurse leaders and managers must be aware of possible trends in the future so that the profession can be influenced positively. Ideally, nurse leaders and managerswill be a leading force in creating the future of health care, not just reacting andadapting to future changes (Grossman & Valiga, 2016). For nurses to thrive in the anticipated increasingly complex health-care environ- ment of the future will require the following (Johnson, 2015, pp. 90-91): Lifelong learning through formal and informal education Ability to implement practice changes rapidly and wellChapter 17 Transitioning From Student to Professional Nurse 363 LEARNING ACTIVITY 17-2 Take the HealthyNurse Health Risk Appraisal (HRA) Available at: http://www.anahra.org/ Register for and take the HealthyNurse Health Risk Appraisal survey.

Whatever goal a nurse pursues,the key is planning to obtain the necessary experience, the proper education, and specialty certification, if appropriate, to develop the knowledge, skills, andattitudes that will prepare the nurse for a long-term career in a dynamic, complexhealth-care environment. Continued competence is critical to the nursing profes-sion as well as ensuring safe, quality nursing care. Nurses must be committed tolifelong learning, which includes career planning and advanced education(AACN, 2008). All nurses should strive for balance between personal life and pro-fessional life. Further, all nurses should support each other's needs for balance between personal and work life. No one can predict the future. However, visual-izing or envisioning several possibilities and developing goals for a preferable future will allow nurses to shape their future.
