It's actually a growing problem", "sitename": "The Dallas Morning News", "date": "2012-12-22", "cleaned_text": "Valerie Wigglesworth's recent series The Burden of Lead is an excellent example of the long-lasting effects of lead contamination, providing compelling proof that the health and environmental threats from lead continue long after smelters close their doors. It is important that your readers understand this is not a problem confined to Dallas. Mexican lead contamination is happening unabated due to the growing exportation of used car and truck batteries from the United States. Last year, 754 million pounds of American Spent Lead Acid Batteries (SLABs) were exported to Mexican recyclers operating under virtually no regulatory control. These facilities have lead air emissions some 20 times higher than those of domestic recyclers and are not required to undertake employee blood-lead screening considered routine in the United States. A recent Commission for Environmental Cooperation study on this issue noted that none of the Mexican facilities recycling American SLABs would be approved for a U.S. license. This exportation to low-cost Mexican facilities prevents domestic recyclers from investing in and improving facilities, thus harming American communities and workers. It's time to stop destroying the environment and threatening communities by ending the practice of exporting SLABs. Let's support clean, responsible American recycling. Diane Cullo, Alexandria, Va. Let's conduct smart redevelopment We at the West Dallas Chamber want to commend Valerie Wigglesworth for her series on the long-term effects of lead on communities across the Dallas-Fort Worth area. It is an important reminder that as we redevelop a neighborhood for future generations, we must give meaningful consideration as to how the redevelopment could affect the health of the people now living in that community, whether it be Frisco, West Dallas, Uptown or South Dallas. Sadly, the harmful effects of development undertaken years or decades ago persist to this day. You are wise to continue to shine a light on that. The good news is, thanks to the removal of lead-producing businesses in Frisco, West Dallas, etc., the generation growing up in those communities today will no doubt live healthier lives than their predecessors did. Developers need not be concerned about coming in and helping to refashion these neighborhoods for a greener tomorrow \u2014 and they are not, if the hubbub being generated by the developers of such West Dallas projects as Trinity Groves, Sylvan/Thirty, the Villas of Dilbeck Court, etc., is any indication.
