In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, several diverse vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 have been developed and deployed for use in a large number of individuals, and have been reported to protect against symptomatic COVID-19 cases and deaths. However, the application of vaccines has a series of limitations, including protective failure for variants of concern, unavailability of individuals due to immune deficiency, and the disappearance of immune protection for increasing infections in vaccinated individuals. These aspects raise the question of how to modulate the immune system that contributes to the COVID-19 vaccine protective effects. Herbal medicines are widely used for their immune regulatory abilities in clinics. More attractively, herbal medicines have been well accepted for their positive role in the COVID-19 prevention and suppression through regulation of the immune system. This review presents a brief overview of the strategy of COVID-19 vaccination and the response of the immune system to vaccines, the regulatory effects and mechanisms of herbal medicine in immune-related macrophages, natural killer cells, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes T and B cells, and how they help vaccines work. Later in the article, the potential role and application of herbal medicines in the most recent COVID-19 vaccination are discussed. This article provides new insights into herbal medicines as promising alternative supplements that may benefit from COVID-19 vaccination. Graphical abstract: Introduction Despite rapid progress in understanding the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), treatment options for this disease remain limited. As vaccination is one of the most successful and effective medical interventions for preventing infectious diseases, much effort has been made to develop COVID-19 vaccines. A series of vaccines are being well deployed and have consequently reduced mortality, prolonged life expectancy, and improved quality of life, as expected[ [1](#R1)- [3](#R3)]. However, in addition to the safety of vaccination in immune-deficient patients[ [4](#R4)- [5](#R5)], the emergence of viral mutants with decreased sensitivity to vaccines[ [6](#R6)- [7](#R7)] and the unclear magnitude and duration of vaccine-induced immune responses and memory with different vaccine platforms require distinct demands and supplemental therapies[ [8](#R8)] in combination with vaccination for COVID-19 control and prevention. The novel, safe, and accessible strategies to enhance the immune effects of a vaccine, thus promoting body-specific and non-specific immunity, are therefore necessary and highly desirable[ [9](#R9)]. Herbal medicines have been widely used to treat various diseases worldwide. However, partially owing to their unclear mechanism and undefined active components, their effectiveness and applications are far from being accepted. In early 2018, an article on \"why Chinese medicine is heading for clinics around the world\" was reported in Nature. For the first time, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized traditional medicine as an influential global medical compendium[ [10](#R10)]. More attractively, it has been shown that the application of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) results in better clinical outcomes for patients with COVID-19 after evaluation of the report focused on outcomes from the reports as well as from 12 randomized controlled trials that had been registered and published[ [10](#R10)]. However, compared with the definite advantages for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, the benefits of herbal medicines for the prevention and protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection are largely unknown. Normally, to block pathogen inbreak, the treatment should enhance the immune system of the body to defend the \"enemy\" strongly and immediately; herbal medicines have a long and promising history in this regard. The regulation of the immune system by herbal medicines, including anti-inflammation, regulation of innate immunity, and balancing of cytokine levels, has also been widely observed in COVID-19[ [11](#R11)]. However, several knowledge gaps remain in terms of our understanding of herbal medicines in relation to immune reactivity during COVID-19 vaccination. This article provides an overview of the immune response during vaccination and the potential role of medicinal herbs in promoting effective immune responses during vaccination, which may be beneficial for COVID-19 vaccination in the future. Vaccine strategy of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines play vital roles in the prevention of diseases and the reduction of morbidity and mortality caused by viral or bacterial infections[ [12](#R12)- [13](#R13)]. During the pandemic COVID-19, extensive efforts have been made to develop and manufacture COVID-19 vaccines. Traditionally, a vaccine contains a carefully chosen molecular entity called the vaccine antigen(s), which is the target of vaccination-induced immune response[ [14](#R14)- [15](#R15)]. Consistently, vaccines of SARS-CoV-2 frequently use spike (S) protein or its S1 subunit, or the receptor binding domain (RBD) in S1 as vaccine antigens because of their ability to induce neutralizing antibody production, which may block host cell entry and inhibit infection. Two mRNA-based vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 and Moderna mRNA-1273) encoded with the stabilized ectodomain version of the S protein showed more than 94% efficacy in preventing COVID-19[ [16](#R16)- [19](#R19)], and elicited natural antibodies[ [20](#R20), [21](#R21)]. Ideally, a designed vaccine is desired to induce complete protection or sterile immunity; however, due to possible safety concerns, it may have issues with incomplete immune induction[ [22](#R22)]. Thus, improving immunity is considered an effective strategy to reduce susceptibility to disease and increase bodily defenses against pathogen invasion[ [23](#R23)- [24](#R24)]. In addition, viral evolution has occurred during the high global burden of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Numerous SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic[ [25](#R25)]. The and Omicron (B.1.1.529) [26](#R26)- [27](#R27)]. Currently, Omicron (BA.4 and BA.5) is the latest variant of concern (VOC) and has become dominant globally since early 2022. The virologic and immunological features associated with VOCs indicate that a larger number of specific mutations in S proteins lead to increased infectious and transmissibility and/or easy escape of vaccination-induced immune responses[ [28](#R28)]. Evaluation of herbal regulations on host immunity, especially during COVID-19 vaccination, may also help respond to the adaptive system induced by different vaccine platforms. Immune responses to vaccination The human immune system is a complex and well-organized system that supports and protects the body against foreign substances called pathogens[ [29](#R29)- [30](#R30)] through two basic elements: the innate and adaptive immune systems[ [31](#R31)]. Similarly, when vaccinating, the whole immune response is experienced, as stimulated by the antigens received from vaccines that carry epitopes with strong antigenicity but low titer[ [32](#R32)]. To avoid an improper response when the body encounters viruses for the first time, vaccination is highly recommended to pre-educate cells of the immune system. At the early stage of the response to the antigen, pre-existing immune cells such as macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and neutrophils in the blood and tissues are the first to identify, capture, and destroy invading pathogens in a rapid response to virtually all pathogens, and consequently initiate inflammation at the local infectious site[ [33](#R33)]. Subsequently, the adaptive immune system is activated, providing long-term systemic protection. A set of leukocytes and lymphocytes, T and B cells, are responsible for the adaptive responses[ [34](#R34)]. The cellular immune response in infected cells is mediated by T lymphocytes. Helper T cells are involved in the overall adaptive immune response, and cytotoxic T cells play a significant role in the clearance of pathogen-infected cells[ [35](#R35)- [36](#R36)]. Additionally, B cell-derived plasma cells produce antibodies, particularly neutralizing antibodies specific to the antigen that will effectively prevent the pathogens from entering the host cells, thus limiting the infection and protecting the body from further infection at a later stage[ [9](#R9)]. Herbal medicines regulate the immune system and may contribute to the vaccination Researchers are attempting to strengthen the human immune system against infections and prevent pathogens from invading. Herbal medicines and their natural bioactive components exhibit various immune regulatory activities through distinct interactions with immune cells. (Table [(Table11](/pmc/articles/PMC9746255/table/T1/)) Table 1 that the crude extract of Polygonum cuspidatum stimulated immune responses in normal BALB/c mice partly by increasing splenic NK cell cytotoxicity. It also helped NK cells isolated from mouse spleen destroy target YAC-1 cells.||Not mentioned||[4546]| |2||The seeds of Astragalus complanatus||Flavonoid||It has been shown that the flavonoid component from the seeds of Astragalus complanatus up-regulated the expression of NK-92 cell activating receptor NKG2D and NKp44, which in turn affects NK-92 cells, serving as an immune stimulator of NK (CD40/MHCII/CD80/CD86) and increased level of nitric oxide (NO) in a dose dependent manner. Interestingly, blockage of NO by iNOS inhibitor slightly decreased CD40 and mRNA expressions [96](#R96)] [97](#R97)] relationships cells are cytotoxic granular lymphoid cells that play a key role in initiating the primary immune response[ [37](#R37)- [38](#R38)]. When viruses or bacteria infect, NK cells are immediately activated by the release of cytolytic granules containing inflammatory cytokines and chemokines[ [39](#R39)]. During vaccination, NK cells are also involved and affected[ [40](#R40)- [43](#R43)]. The secreted factors may further recruit components that subsequently activate innate and adaptive immune responses. It is known that ligand-receptor interactions between NK cell surfaces and pathogens control and mediate NK activation[ [44](#R44)]. The major receptors responsible for include NKp46, NKp30, NKp44, and NKG2D[ [45](#R45)]. Several herbal medicines have exhibited their ability to stimulate NK cell proliferation and enhance NK cell toxicity. Polygonum cuspidatum is widely distributed in China and Japan owing to its lipid regulation, anti-infection, and anti-inflammatory effects[ [46](#R46)]. The crude extract of P. cuspidatum has been found to stimulate immune responses in BALB/c mice by increasing splenic NK cell cytotoxicity. It also helps NK cells destroy the targeted YAC-1 cells[ [47](#R47)]. A flavonoid component from the seeds upregulates the expression of NKG2D and NKp44 in NK cells, which in turn stimulates NK-92 cells and serves as an immune stimulator of NK cells for therapeutic treatment[ [48](#R48)]. Commercial Shenmai injection is a TCM that was officially included in the 2015 edition of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. It has been reported that Shenmai injection in patients with gastric cancer significantly increased the activity of NK cells in serum[ [49](#R49)]. Recently, the availability of Shenmai injections for COVID-19 has been evaluated by molecular docking and network pharmacology. Data showed that 22 compounds and 16 targets were predicted in the Shenmai injection that was shared with COVID-19[ [50](#R50)]. Macrophages Macrophages represent the first line of host defense behind the epithelial barrier, with a variety of complex bactericidal functions, including surveillance, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and destruction of target organisms[ [51](#R51)- [52](#R52)]. Similar to the recognition of NK cells by receptors, macrophage activation is mainly achieved through specific receptors. There are three types of receptors on macrophages, including pattern recognition receptors and CD86)[ a result of binding and medication, multi-signaling pathways such as Nuclear factor kappa B (MAPK), and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase(PI3K) /protein kinaseB(AKT) are involved and activated in the host defense following vaccination. Resveratrol is a natural compound widely distributed in the red grape skin, Japanese knotweed (P. cuspidatum), peanuts, and blueberries[ [57](#R57)]. It has been reported that resveratrol enhances the immune response by upregulation of CD86 and MHC-II expression in macrophages from a vaccine of pseudorabies virus-immunized mice, and the expression of TLR4, inhibitor N-terminal kinase resveratrol-treated group[ [58](#R58)]. Cordyceps militaris is a medicinal herb with variety of functions, such as anti-inflammatory activity[ [59](#R59)]. Pharmacological research has shown that polysaccharides isolated from C. militaris upregulated the uptake of Nitric Oxide (NO), Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF-), promoted phagocytosis, and activated NF-B and MAPK pathways through DECIN-1 and TLR2 in mouse peritoneal and RAW264.7 macrophages, indicating a role in immune modulation[ [60](#R60)]. The polysaccharides isolated from Citrus (IL-6), Interleukin-12 (IL-12, TNF- signaling[ [61](#R61)]. Ganoderma atrum polysaccharides have been demonstrated to induce an immune response by recognizing the mannose receptor and TLR4 through the NF-B pathway in macrophages[ [62](#R62)]. Another polysaccharide from dried \"Shixia\" longan pulp significantly enhanced the phagocytic function of macrophages and promoted the production of NO, IL-1, IL-6 and active extract from Astragalus membranaceus, have been reported to activate the TLR4/MyD88-dependent signaling pathway in RAW 264.7 root, a medicinal herb in southern China, has been used to inhibit upper respiratory infections in folk medicine for years[ [65](#R65)]. Polysaccharides from R. minima root remarkably enhanced the phagocytic ability of macrophages and promoted NO release and secretion of TNF-, IL-6, and MCP-1, and are thus considered promising immune enhancers used in functional foods or drugs[ [66](#R66)]. Persimmon leaves are commonly used to treat infectious diseases[ [60](#R60)]. One study showed that polysaccharides from persimmon leaves activated TLR2-mediated NF-B activation iNOS, TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6 in which immune stimulators[ [67](#R67)]. Dendritic cells Dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial for linking innate to specific adaptive immunity, which is associated with their activation and maturation status[ [68](#R68)]. As bone marrow-derived cells, DCs may be generated from multiple precursor cells including lymphoid and myeloid progenitors. Before activation, DCs reside in the periphery, where they take up antigens. Once activated, they migrate to lymphoid organs and present processed antigens to T cells[ [69](#R69)]. By upregulating co-stimulatory and surface molecule expression and cytokines, DCs elicit a potent immune response[ [70](#R70)- [71](#R71)]. Given the central role of DC in controlling the immune response, DCs are considered a critical cell type and potential target when vaccine injection is completed. Saikosaponin-d is a triterpenoid saponin derived from Bupleurum falcatum L. Its anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antiviral properties have been demonstrated in carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats and acetic acid-induced vascular permeability RAW 264.7, and cancer [73](#R73)]. Saikosaponin-d reduced the differentiation human with condylomata expression[ [74](#R74)]. Saikosaponin-d also highly promoted DC maturation by increasing the expression of CD40, CD83, CD80, and CD86, whereas the function of mature DCs, including IL-12 secretion and lymphocyte growth stimulation, was significantly elevated in response to Saikosaponin-d treatment[ [74](#R74)]. Polysaccharides are a series of compounds that have attracted considerable attention because of their intrinsic immunomodulatory characteristics[ [75](#R75)]. Data have shown that crude polysaccharides derived from carrot pomace increased both the fraction of CD11c+ MHCII+ cells and the expression of CD40 and CD80 in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and the and vaccine-specific antibody titers in cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppressed experiencing an vaccine challenge[ [76](#R76)]. A polysaccharide derived from Rehmannia glutinosa has been found to induce the activation and maturation of DCs with altered dendritic morphology and increased expression of co-stimulatory molecules[ [77](#R77)- the activation of DCs by R. glutinosa polysaccharides was dependent on the ERK, p38, and JNK signaling pathways[ [78](#R78)]. Similarly, it has been reported that a polysaccharide isolated from Chrysanthemum zawadskii Herbich var. latilobum leaves induced the maturation of DCs through the activation of MAPK and NF-B signaling pathways, which subsequently activate naive T cells to polarize CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and induce the production of IFN- and IL-2 in vitro[ [79](#R79)]. Three types membranaceus, Ganoderma lucidum, and Radix ophiopogonis were characterized and tested their immunoactivities. They significantly elongated dendrites, reduced their phagocytic abilities, the in BMDCs[ [80](#R80)]. Polysaccharides isolated from Annona DC maturation by upregulating Th1-polarizing cytokine secretion and surface molecule expression, which in enhanced the antigen-presenting ability[ [81](#R81)]. Similar to macrophages, DCs have important toll-like their membranes. Distinct polysaccharides purified from through TLR4 signaling. Adaptive immune system The adaptive immune system is the second line of defense that defends against pathogen-specific invasion, mainly through T and B lymphocytes. Briefly, T lymphocytes function by mediating cellular immunity and adjusting immunity, whereas B lymphocytes mainly participate in humoral immunity. In contrast to immediate innate immunity, adaptive immunity develops upon pathogen exposure and is long-lasting and sustained by memory cells. T lymphocytes T lymphocytes (also referred to as T cells) are pluripotent stem cells derived from the bone marrow, where pre-T cells migrate and mature in the thymus and export to the periphery[ [86](#R86)]. Diverse T cell types are involved in the immune system. Naive T cells are first activated by either antigen-specific signals delivered by the T cell receptor or by the interaction of CD28 on T cells and CD80 or CD86 on antigen-presenting cells[ [87](#R87)]. Once activated, naive T cells rapidly differentiate into helper T cells (CD4+ T cells/Th cells), cytotoxic T cells (CD8+ T cells), and regulatory T cells. More subsets of CD4+ T cells, including T helper 1 (Th1), T helper 2 (Th2), and follicular helper T cells (Tfh)[ [88](#R88)], are differentiated with multiple functions. Th1 cells have the ability to promote the proliferation, differentiation, and maturation of CD8+ T cells and enhance the cells provide an excellent auxiliary function for antibody production by B cells, especially IgE antibodies[ [89](#R89)- [90](#R90)]. Tfh cells differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells and memory B cells[ [90](#R90)]. Unlike assisted CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells directly kill infected cells, clear intracellular pathogens, and secrete cytokines such as IFN- and TNF[ [91](#R91)]. The dynamic balances of Th1/Th2 and CD4+/CD8+ ratios are thus considered remarkable markers of immune status and body homeostasis maintenance[ [92](#R92)- [93](#R93)]. Many herbal medicines enhance immunity by regulating T-cell-related functions. A series of natural compounds isolated from medicinal herbs, such as astragalus polysaccharides, epididymal polysaccharides, propolis flavonoids, lymphocyte proliferation[ [94](#R94)]. The widely distributed compound resveratrol[ [57](#R57)] also increases the number of T lymphocytes when used as an immune adjuvant in a pseudorabies virus vaccine[ [58](#R58)]. The differentiation and ratio of subsets in CD4+ T cells have also been investigated when drugs are administered. A Chinese commercial medicine named Yanyankang powder inhibited the differentiation of Th0 to Th1 cells but promoted Th0 to Th2 cells in autoimmune uveitis rats but upregulation of [96](#R96)]. Herbal Scolopendra subspinipes mutilans L. Koch has been used for cancer treatment for hundreds of years in China, and its immunostimulatory activity has been shown to accelerate the Th1/Th2 ratio and increase the number of CD4+ T cells[ [97](#R97)]. Similarly, Shashen Maidong decoction, a representative prescription for nourishing Yin and generating body fluid, blocked the Th1/Th2 imbalance by increasing IFN- and decreasing IL-4[ [98](#R98)]. In addition, the antigen-specific Tfh response plays a vital role in enhancing the protective effects of vaccines. It has been found that a Lycium barbarum-derived polysaccharide played a variety of immune-modulatory functions through activation of CXCR5+ PD-1+ Tfh cells, as induction of [99](#R99)]. The CD4+/CD8+ ratio was observed herb-regulated immune responses. Polysaccharides from R. minima significantly upregulated both the percentage of CD4+ T lymphocytes and splenocyte ratio, which effectively alleviated cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression in mice[ Chinese lactiflora, and Ophiopogon japonicus increased the CD4+/CD8+ humoral and cellular immune functions in immunosuppressed mice[ [100](#R100)]. Another report showed a similar effect of a commercialized Fuzheng Qingjie granule on [101](#R101)]. B lymphocytes One of the main protective processes induced by vaccines is antibody production from B lymphocytes (B cells), which can directly recognize extracellular antigenic moieties of pathogens through their immunoglobulin B-call receptor present in the outer membrane and become activated and differentiate into plasma cells to produce specific antibodies[ [102](#R102)]. The association between antibody response to different vaccines and dynamic immune repertoire changes in different cell subsets may not be equal, and there are several host- and vaccine-specific factors modulating an antibody response in B cells, which may contribute to the loss of vaccine efficacy[ [103](#R103)]. Several studies have shown that B cells are the major target cells of herbal medicines. A natural polysaccharide-derived Advax adjuvant showed its immunologically activity that mice immunized with inactivated influenza virus vaccine in Advax had significantly higher frequencies of influenza-specific B cells secreting IgG and IgM in the bone marrow and spleen than mice immunized with vaccine alone[ [104](#R104)]. Polysaccharide IIP-A-1 isolated from the Chinese herb Isatis indigotica root has been reported to activate influenza H1N1 and hepatitis B surface antigen vaccines[ [105](#R105)]. Another polysaccharide, IIP-2, isolated from I. indigotica root, enhanced the titer of neutralizing antibodies and promoted the activation of lymph node B cells and the recruitment of B cells in the serum. Administration of inactivated rabies virus mixed with IIP-2 provided complete protection against HuNPB3 rabies infection[ [106](#R106)]. A polysaccharide isolated from R. P. markedly increased polyclonal IgM production and B-cell proliferation[ [107](#R107)]. It has been demonstrated that Coriolus versicolor mushroom polysaccharides bound and induced B cell activation using membrane Ig and TLR4 as potential immune receptors. C. versicolor mushroom polysaccharides activate mouse B cells through the MAPK and NF-B signaling pathways[ [108](#R108)]. Polysaccharides extracted from alfalfa grass activated splenic B cells by TLR4 through the MAPK/p38 pathway, and selectively improved the cell viability and IgM production of B cells but did not affect T cell viability[ [109](#R109)]. Polysaccharides separated from the roots of Acanthopanax koreanum, grandiflorum, and Acanthopanax senticosus stimulate B cells through CD19 and CD79b, suggesting that these polysaccharides may directly bind to the mIg of B cells[ [110](#R110)- [112](#R112)]. The potential roles of herbal medicines in the regulation of COVID-19 vaccination The information described earlier shows that herbal medicines modulate the immune response in multiple ways on different scales, which may help to generate or optimize vaccine strategies (Figure [(Figure1).1](/pmc/articles/PMC9746255/figure/F1/)). When a novel vaccine market is available, its protective function, associated immune response, and vaccination schedules are evaluated. COVID-19 vaccines have been designed and marketed by numerous countries and companies worldwide to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the dynamic immune responses and protective effects of vaccines remain elusive. Researchers have been devoted to uncovering the immune responses after COVID-19 vaccination. A study in China found that the inactivated virus COVID-19 vaccine CoronaVac had 65.9% effectiveness against COVID-19, 90.3% against intensive care, and 86.3% against death[ [113](#R113)] through induction of robust circulating and memory B cell and T cell responses[ [114](#R114)]. In a prospective cohort of 100 individuals who received SARS-CoV-2 CoronaVac[ [114](#R114)], spike-specific IgG responses peaked after two doses and rapidly declined in 8 to 10 weeks after the booster dose. Spike-specific circulating and memory B cells were effectively induced, followed by a decrease after 8 to 10 weeks, as well. SARS-CoV-2-specific circulating CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells were detected 2 weeks after the booster dose and sustained over time, and memory CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells were identified as SARS-CoV-2-specific 8 to 10 weeks after the booster dose. Another study performed head-to-head comparisons of T cells, B cells, and antibody responses, with a particular interest in immune memory, to four diverse vaccines, namely, Moderna mRNA-1273, results showed that immunological responses on memory CD4+ T cells were consistent, whereas other responses varied, which may be dependent on distinct vaccine design insights. For example, cTfh and CD4-CTL were highly expressed after mRNA or NVX30CoV2373 vaccination, comparable CD8+ T cell frequencies were induced by mRNA and Ad26.COV2.S vaccines, and mRNA vaccines had substantial declines in neutralizing antibodies, whereas memory T cells and B cells were comparatively stable over 6 months. Importantly, the issue of protective immunity against different variants was evaluated. Studies on the impact of a large panel of variants on memory T and B cells, particularly in the context of COVID-19 vaccination, have shown that T cells of vaccines recognize SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron, in which B cell RBD memory recognition of Omicron is reduced. A median of 11 CD4 and 10 CD8 spike epitopes have been recognized in vaccines[ [115](#R115)]. One of the definite responses is the normal immune reaction that helps produce pre-existing immune cells and antibodies. Several studies on SARS-CoV-2 immunity have reported the occurrence of pre-existing immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in the population, including pre-existing antibodies and immune cells, especially specific memory T cells[ [116](#R116)- [119](#R119)]. The understanding and evidence of herbal medicines in the regulation of COVID-19 vaccines are still unclear, and their potential effects and anticipated benefits have not been thoroughly considered. However, previous findings of herbs suggest that herbal medication enhances the human immune abilities with vaccine immunization, which seems to greatly affect body defense and may benefit from their definite regulation of immunity. It may strengthen the innate immune system by NK and macrophage proliferation or secretion, reinforce the DC function to bridge the innate and adaptive immune system, or alter the patterns of evolution of antibodies arising from specific and defined antigens, such as delivery systems with T or B lymphocytes or adjuvantation to target and trigger effective adaptive immunity of the COVID-19 vaccine. In addition, it affects the response among individuals in a variation in the degree of disease, and some individuals with herbal assistants may exhibit a better response to vaccination, such as significant increases in serum nAb responses against vaccine-matched and emerging variants. Conclusion Although a large knowledge gap remains to be filled in herb-regulated vaccine responses, the advances discussed in this article have expanded our insights into numerous applications, including COVID-19 vaccines. This review may provide a framework for understanding herbs in vaccine strategies, and the limitations of vaccines may be alleviated the immunoregulatory activities of medicinal herbs. The COVID-19 vaccination currently requires further identification and confirmation, which is a result of increased interest and encouraged research efforts.
