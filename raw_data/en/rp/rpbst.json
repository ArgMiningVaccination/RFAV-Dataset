HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing iii Executive Summary The objective of this health technology assessment (HTA) short report was to evaluate the benefits and harms associated with vitamin B12 tests (i.e. serum B12, holotranscobalamin [holoTC] and methylmalonic acid [MMA]) in patients with a clinical suspicion of, or at high risk for, vitamin B12 deficiency. In addition, legal, social, ethical and organisational issues associated with vitamin B12 testing were considered. The applicability of such findings has been discussed within the Swiss context. Clinical evaluation Systematic literature searches were conducted to identify existing systematic review (SR) evidence addressing the research questions. In addition, primary literature was sought to fill gaps in existing SR evidence, and to update existing SRs where appropriate. D irect evidence evaluating the impact of B12 testing on patient -relevant outcomes from randomised or non- randomised trials was sought with priority. In the absence of direct evidence, a linked evidence approach was undertaken. De novo meta- analysis was outside the scope of this evaluation. Direct evidence No direct evidence evaluating the impact of B12 testing on patient -relevant outcome s was identified. Linked evidence: test accuracy One existing SR evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of serum B12 testing (searches up to November 2009) was identified (k = 36) . No existing reviews of holoTC or MMA were identified. In addition, six primary studies published since November 2009 were included. Of these, six evaluated vitamin B12 (n = 15,608) , five evaluated holoTC (n = 15,531) , and two evaluated MMA (n = 11,910) . All primary studies were considered to be at risk of bias. Sensitivity of the vitamin B12 test against MMA as a reference standard ranged from 52% to 72%, reported by one SR and three primary diagnostic accuracy studies. Specificity ranged from 41% to 81%. A primary study conducted in Switzerland with a large sample size and novel reference standard (4cB12 method) reported sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 78 % in identifying patients with subclinical vitamin B12 deficiency. The quality of evidence was very low. Two paired single -gate diagnostic accuracy stud ies (n = 2,638) and one paired two- gate diagnostic accuracy study (n = 360) that investigated holoTC as an index test and used MMA as a reference standard reported sensitivity ranging from 56% to 83%, and specificity from 51 % HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing iv to 60%. The paired two- gate diagnostic accuracy study t hat employ ed the 4cB12 model as a reference standard reported sensitivity and specificity of 86 % and 81%, respectively, in possibl y deficient cases (n = 51) . The quality of evidence was low. One paired single- gate diagnostic accuracy study used MMA as an i ndex test , one us ed holoTC as a reference standard (n = 77), and one used a 4cB12 model (n = 11,833) . The holoTC study reported sensitivity and specificity of 40% and 94% , respectively (low quality ). The 4cB12 study reported sensitivity and specificity of 82% and 83%, respectively ( low quality ). Serum B12 measured with holoTC as the reference standard typically yielded lower sensitivity and specificity compared to studies that used 4cB12 as the reference standard. The quality of evidence was low. Linked evi dence: change in management Three cross -sectional studies evaluated the impact of MMA and B12 testing on clinical management decisions (n = 608) . No studies regarding holoTC testing were identified. Two of these studies concluded that hospital patients who received test results indicating low levels of vitamin B12 or MMA were not managed according to recommendations. One study reported that MMA was followed up appropriately in Danish GP clinics , however , it was often used as a screening test in asymptomatic patients . The s tudies were at a high risk of bias. Linked evidence: effectiveness of change in management Eight SRs reviewed vitamin B12 supplementation in patients with a B12 deficiency . The studies reviewed populations with vitamin B12 deficiency relate d to a gastrointestinal disorder, pernicious anaemia, before and/or after bariatric surgery, neurodegenerative disorder and/or cognitive impairment, or of unknown aetiology. These studies investigated differences between the dosage and route of vitamin B12 supplement ation . In participants with deficient vitamin B12 levels, high doses (i.e. 1,000 \u00b5g) of orally administered vitamin B12 was found to be as effective as intramuscular administration in correcting vitamin B12 deficiency and achieving clinical responses. The reviews did not evaluate the safety of supplementation. The risk of bias in the included reviews range d from low to high. Five SRs and 30 primary research studies investigated the natural course of vitamin B12 deficiency. These studies reported that insufficient vitamin B12 levels, when left untreated, can lead to conditions ranging from mild to severe (e.g., neurological abnormalities, cognitive impairment, haematological abnormalities, complications during pregnancy). HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing v Social, legal, ethical an d organisational issues Systematic and non- systematic searches identified 22 relevant studies of primary and secondary research. Social and organisational issues related to B12 testing included the medicalisation of vitamins and the subsequent rise in unnecessary testing. Physicians recommended several way to reduce unnecessary vitamin B12 testing in practice: additional educational resources and contemporary guidelines, longer consultation times, and removal of vitamin B12 tests from testing kits. A key et hical concern was related to false positives and false negatives ; however, the potential harm caused by these erroneous outcomes is minimised because it takes several years for vitamin B12 levels to become depleted , vitamin deficiency is treatable through supplementation, and physicians are likely to prescribe supplementation for borderline cases of vitamin B12 deficiency. No legal issues were identified. Conclusion There is currently no evidence directly measuring the impact of B12 tests on patient reported outcomes. Similarly, there do not appear to be widely accepted clinical standards for the indications, number and order of tests, and diagnostic thresholds for B12 testing in Swiss practice. Evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of B12 tests is complicated by the absence of an established reference standard, the presence of confounding factors (e.g. renal insufficiency, age), and variable reference thresholds for diagnosis. The current evidence does not inform the most appropriate test, or combination of tes ts to investigate a patient with suspected, or at high risk of, B12 deficiency, nor the utility of such tests on impacting patient -relevant outcomes.

technology assessment (HTA) short report is to generate a focused assessment of various aspects of a health technology. The HTA short report format does not include a scoping phase. The analytic methods applied to assess the value of using a health technology are described. The analytical process is systematic and transparent, and it involves multiple stakeholders. The domains covered may include clinical effectiveness and safety , and legal, social, ethical and organisational issues. The purpose is to inform health policy and decision- making to promote an efficient, sustainable, equitable and high- quality health system.HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 1 1 Policy question and context In the past five years, there has been a marked incre ase in the use of vitamin B12 test ing in Switzerland, specifically in relation to tests for vitamin B12, transcobalamin II and III, holotranscobalamin ( holoTC), and methylmalonic acid (MMA) . The accompanying rise in expenditure for these tests, covered under mandatory health insurance, rose from CHF 39.6 Mio in 2015 to CHF 65.2 Mio in 2019 . It has been questioned whether vitamin B12 testing in patients at risk of B12 deficiency , and in patients with a clinical suspicion of B12 deficiency , is essential prior to commencing vitamin B12 supplementation. 2 Medical background 2.1 Medical context of the technology/disease 2.1.1 Function and sources of vitamin B12 Vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin, is a water -soluble compound with roles in the production of red blood cells, synthesis of thymidine for generation of deoxyribonucleic acid, and maintenance of the myelin coating of neurons.1 Vitamin B12 contains the metal ion cobalt, and hence 'cobalamin' is used to refer to compounds that have vitamin B12 activity. Humans depend on the dietary intake of vitamin B12, with sufficient amounts found naturally in animal - derived food products such as meat, poultry, fish, shellfish, eggs, milk , and milk products.2 3 Vitamin B12 is not commonly found in plant -based foods,4 5 although various types of edible algae (i.e. nori) and nutritional yeast have been found to contain substantial amounts of vitamin B12.6 Trace levels of vitamin B12 have also been detected in fermented beans and vegetables, along with edible mushrooms, beans , and vegetables grown in soil enriched using organic fertilisers or hydroponics.6 Fortified foods such as breakfast cereals are a readily available source of vitamin B12, often providing an important proportion of daily intake. 3 7 Examples of sources of dietary vitamin B12 are presented in Table 1. To prevent and treat a vitamin B12 deficiency, vitamin B12 can also be supplemented via intramuscular, oral, and nasal routes. 8 A number of formulation of supplemental vitamin B12 exist, including methylcobalamin, hydroxocobalamin, and cyanocobalamin. The use of each formulation differs depending on the condit ion or symptoms being treated.

Notes *The estimated vitamin B12 content in fortified breakfast cereals varies considerably. Source Adapted from N ational Institute of Health 20209 and US Department of Agriculture 201710 2.1.2 Mechanism of vitamin B12 absorption Salivary glands and stomach parietal cells excrete the protein haptocorrin, which forms a complex with dietary vitamin B12. This binding protects the vitamin from degradation by stomach acid and proteases , allowing it to move through the gastrointestinal tract to the terminal ileum . Here, pancreatic enzymes release the vitamin from the protein. The vitamin is subsequently available to bind to the intrinsic factor protein (IF), which transports vitamin B12 into the blood stream for distribution around the body. After its release into the bloodstream, the vitamin binds to the protein transcobalamin II, becoming holoTC, which is considered the 'active ' B12 form.11 HoloTC can then be transported into the cells for metabolism. Alternatively, the vitamin binds to haptocorrin and is not taken up by cells. This is the case for approximately 80% of absorbed vitamin B12.12 Interruption of any of these steps places a person at risk of developing vitamin B12 deficiency. However, stores of excess vitamin B12 in the liver may take several years to deplete before ultimately resulting in a deficiency. 3 An IF -independent pathway results in the passive absorption of a small amount of dietary vitamin B12 (approximately 1%) .13 As demonstrated by untreated individuals with abnormal IF production or function, malabsorption patients cannot exclusively rely on passive diffusion long term. HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 3 2.1.3 Causes of vitamin B12 def iciency A deficiency is defined as a lack of vitamin B12 within cellular/metabolic processes that may cause symptoms and morbidities if untreated. The term ' deficiency ' describes the condition independent of its aetiology (i.e. malnutrition or malabsorption). Within this report, cases with low vitamin B12 intake (e.g. vegan diet) are referred to as malnutrition, and cases with low/poor absorption (e.g. post -bariatric surgery) are referred to as malabsorption . There are a variety of causes that lead to vitam in B12 deficiency within specific high- risk groups. The likelihood of developing vitamin B12 deficiency increases with age, with adults older than 60 years at the greatest risk .14 In this group, the primary cause of vitamin B12 deficiency is pernicious anaemia and malabsorption of food- bound vitamin B12.15 Other groups at risk of dietary deficiency include those who do not consume anim al-based food products (particularly pregnant and lactating women) .15 16 In less common cases, deficiency may be due to hereditary vitamin B12 metabolic diseases leading to the inability to metabolise and absorb vi tamin B12. Malabsorption of bound vitamin B12 is characterised by the inability to absorb food- and/or protein- bound vitamin B12.17 Malabsorption of food- bound vitamin B12 is most often caused by atrophic gastritis,17 a chronic inflammatory condition characterised by atrophy of the oxyntic glands , which results in reduced secretion of gastric acid and IF.3 Atrophic gastritis commonly leads to diminished gastric function and can result in bacterial overgrowth in the stomach and small intestine, leading to vitamin B12 malabsorption. 14 Atrophic gastritis affects 10% to 30% of adults over 60 years of age.14 Another cause of malabsorption of food- bound vitamin B12 is pernicious anaemia, an autoimmune disease occurring in end stage atrophic gastritis.18 19 Pernicious anaemia is the result of autoimmune antibodies that des troy parietal cells in the stomach or bind to IF , thereby preventing its interaction with vitamin B12 or its receptor on the ileum.20 The destruction of these cells and blocking of IF causes decreased secretion of acid and enz ymes crucial in releasing food- bound vitamin B12, ultimately leading to malabsorption.18 Pernicious anaemia affects approximately 1% to 2% of adults over 60 years of age.21 Both atrophic gastritis and pernicious anaemia have also been associated with Helicobacter pylori infection,9 18 22 a bacterium causing chronic inflammation of the stomach, which can progress to peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer, and can also lead to increased chances of having gastric surgery.8 9 22 Other less common causes of vitamin B12 deficiency resulting from malabsorption include alcoholism, and the use of drugs such as antacids (i.e. proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonists), HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 4 biguanides (i .e. , and colchicine.4 6 Gastrointestinal ( GI) surgery, including gastric resection and bariatric surgery, may cause the loss of cells that secrete IF and hydrochloric acid,24 resulting in a reduced amount of vitamin B12 able to be absorbed from foods.24 Other GI disorders such as Crohn's disease, Whipple's disease and coeliac disease may also result in vitamin B12 deficiency due to the inability to absorb food- bound vitamin B12.25 Dietary deficiency Vitamin B12 deficiency may arise in those who consume a strict vegetarian or vegan diet due to the nonconsumption of animal -based f ood products, which are the main source of vitamin B12 in the human diet.17 22 Pregnant or lactating women who follow a strict vegetarian or vegan diet are also at an increased risk of vitamin B12 deficiency.9 26 During pregnancy, vitamin B12 crosses the placental barrier. It is also present in breast milk. Therefore, women who do not consume animal -based food products may have very low reserves of vitamin B12, placing their foetus and breastfeeding children at risk of deficiency.9 26 Hereditary vitamin B12 metabolism diseases In rare cases, hereditary diseases affecting the metabolism of vitamin B12 have been found in infants. For ex ample, Imerslund- Gr\u00e4sbeck syndrome is a hereditary vitamin B12 malabsorption syndrome that causes neurological disorders and megaloblastic anaemia in affected patients. 27 Another hereditary condition with similar symptoms is found i n patients with congenital pernicious anaemia (i.e. IF deficiency), leading to the inability to absorb vitamin B12 due to the lack of IF.28 2.2 Incidence or prevalence of the disease There is limited published literature to inform the prevalence rates of vitamin B12 deficiency in Switzerland (Table 23). Therefore, the prevalence rates from other World Health Organisation ( WHO )- Mortality Stratum A are presented, noting the applicability to Switzerland is uncertain. In addition, the following prevalence est imates likely underestimate the true rates as many patients may be unaware they are deficient (and hence are not tested) , owing to the asymptomatic nature of the disorder. The prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency reported in the literature varies considerably, with 2.7% of adults in the United States of America (USA), 8.3% of adults in the United Kingdom (UK) and 14.7% of adults in Germany diagnosed with low serum or plasma B12 concentrations (less than 130 to 148 picomoles per litre (pmol/L)). 29 In Switzerland , the incidence of vitamin B12 deficiency has been reported as 8.0% in people aged 60 to 69 years, to 13.4% for those aged 70 to 79, and 19.0% for those aged 80 HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 5 and older.30 The incidence of pernicious anaemia also increases with age, and is a main cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in 15% to 20% of cases.31 The prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency varies among specific risk populations ( Table 2 ). For example, the highest prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency was observed in vegetarians with the lowest prevalence observed in pregnant women.32 Table 2 The prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency stratified by clinical condition Clinical condition Prevalence rate of vitamin B12 deficiency Achlorhydria (absence of hydrochloric acid in the stomach) 20% of those age >65 years Vegetarianism 53% of of metformin users Pregnancy 10% of women after 28 days pregnancy Source Moore 201232 2.3 Natural course and/or burden of the disease People with a clinical suspicion of vitamin B12 deficiency may have symptoms ranging from mild (e.g. fatigue) to severe (e.g. dementia and polyneuropathies).16 Symptoms vary among patients and are often ambiguous. This is particularly true in the elderly , and subclinical cases.16 Individuals with B12 deficiency may also be asymptomatic and not present with symptoms for several years.3 Symptoms and signs associated with vitamin B12 deficiency are presented in Table 3. HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 6 Table 3 Symptoms and signs of vitamin B12 deficiency Body system/organs involved Cognitive impairment, including dementia -like symptoms and acute psychosis Gait abnormalities Irritability Loss of proprioception and vibratory 2.4 Diagnostic and treatment pathway(s) 2.4.1 Diagnostic pathway There are four main tests that can be performed to investigate vitamin B12 levels , but there is currently no single reference test available that can confirm a diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency. Each test (total serum B12, holoTC, MMA, and homocysteine) is susceptible to confounding factors. A total serum B12 test is used as a firs t-line test where there is cause to suspect deficiency. The result may be positive, negative or in a grey zone (i.e. an area of uncertainty between positive and negative results ). A positive result or a grey zone result is commonly investigated via a second -line test that may be holoTC, MMA or homocysteine ( Hcy). Performing these tests in addition to the serum B12 test increases test sensitivity and specificity of the testing cascade, ultimately reducing false positive and false negative rates.33 34 However, diagnostic thresholds for each test var y according to different guidelines , countr ies, or testing laborator ies (see Section 9 for further information). Likewise, recomm endations for these tests , and the order in which they are recommended, vary across guidelines.16 HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 7 The diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency is further complicated if a patient's signs and/or symptoms do not correlate with test results. Some people with positive test results may be asymptomatic , while others who are symptomatic can have test results within the normal range.16 Therefore, the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency and subsequent treatment recommendations require a consideration of the test results and the clinical picture.16 Figure 1 depicts two possible pathway s for diagnosis and treatment in patients with a clinical sus picion or higher risk of vitamin B12 deficiency . Figure 1 Pathway for diagnosi ng and treat ing patients with clinical suspicion or at risk of vitamin B12 deficiency Abbreviations Hcy = homocysteine, = micrograms. Source Guidance described in Devalia 201416 was used to create this figure. Total vitamin B12 Quantifying total serum or plasma vitamin B12 is the most common and direct method used in the assessment of a suspected B12 deficiency. However, the test is susceptible to confounding factors such as genetic polymorphisms, age, and renal impairment. 34 Anti-IF antibodies in pernicious anaemia can interfere with the assay and lead to false negative or even elevated results.35 36 Furthermore, the type of assay and method used may have an affect on accuracy.37 Up to 80% of circulating vitamin B12 is HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 8 not available for cellular uptake.11 It is recommended that the diagnostic results are considered in the context of the clinical situation.11 37 The only publicly available Swiss guidelin e, published by MediX , suggest s total serum/plasma B12 a s a first -line test to investigate suspicion of vitamin B12 deficiency , or to test at -risk patients.38 HoloTC Up to 80% of circulating B12 is bound to the protein haptocorrin, forming a compound known as holoha ptocorrin. This binding prevents interactions between B12 and the transport protein transcobalamin II that is responsible for transporting vitamin B12 into cells for metabolism. This transport only occurs when vitamin B12 and transcobalamin II are bou nd, forming holoTC. Vitamin B12 testing does not differentiate between holoTC and holohaptocorrin, therefore total vitamin B12 status results often do not give a true picture of the fraction of circulating B12 that can be used in cellular metabolic processes.11 Measurin g holoTC therefore seems to be a valuable tool in the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency.11 However, the advantages of measuring holoTC instead of vitamin B12 are not consistent across the literature, with Swiss practice guidelines only recommending the use of hol oTC to diagnose deficiency in pregnant women.38 Similar to the total B12 test ( Figure 1), holoTC has a grey zone and variable thresholds among guidelines. Recommendations against the us e of holoTC as a first line test often c ite the high cost of the test.33 MMA MMA is a biomarker used to assess vitamin B12 tissue status. Cellular MMA is produced during the breakdown of proteins and is a crucial substrate during succinyl -CoA production and catabolism of amino acids and odd- chain fatty acids.11 Vitamin B12 acts as a catalyst in the conversion of MMA -CoA to succinyl -CoA (see Figure 2 ).39 40 A reduction of activity in this pathway due to limited vitamin B12 results in an accumulation of MMA, which is re garded as a biomarker for vitamin B12 deficiency. However, this biomarker test is sensitive to factors such as renal insufficiency, age, bacterial overgrowth, hypovolaemia, and enzyme defects.34 41 Patient context is an important consideration when deciding whether to test MMA levels. Swiss and other clinical practice guidelines suggest using MMA as a second- line test to confirm a deficiency after a low or grey zone serum B12 result.3 38 HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 9 Figure 2 The role of vitamin B12 in the pathway of succinyl -CoA and methionine from MMA and homocysteine + folic acid Abbreviations CoA = coenzyme A, MMA = methylmalonic acid. Source Oh 200340 Other tests for B12 deficiency Vitamin B12 and holoTC tests are the focus of this report, with some discussion of MMA testing. Two additional blood tests (i.e. H cy and mean corpuscular value [MCV ]) are mentioned in the literature and may be used by some clinicians in assessing serum B12 status. These tests are outside of the scope of this report as they are non- specific and of less relevance to the Swiss context . The Swiss guideline (MediX)38 discusses how Hcy and MCV may be used as indicators of vitamin B12 deficiency in the laboratory, however these tes ts are not described in the diagnostic pathway. - Hcy: In vitamin B12 deficiency, the metabolites MMA and Hcy accumulate as the pathway becomes limited by the unavailabi lity of vitamin B12 (see Figure 2 ). These produc ts are considered to be sensitive biomarkers that are useful for indicating a vitamin B12 deficiency at the tissue level. Hcy has many confounding factors and other diseases associated with its elevation , such as folate deficiency . Consequently, it is non- specific and inaccurate when used alone. When used in combination with other tests, Hcy is comparatively more useful for detecting a vitamin B12 deficiency than when used alone.42 - MCV: MCV is a measure of the volume of red blood cells. A systematic review ( SR) reported that up to 84% of B12- deficient patients will be overlooked if MCV is used to select patients for further evaluation (based on results obtained from an anaemic and non- anaemic population) .43 - 4cB12: A model has been recently developed by Fedosov (2010) , which incorporates all four vitamin B12 tests (serum B12, MMA, holoTC, and Hcy).44 The values obtained from the tests, along with a patient 's age, are input into a formula (depicted below). The equation can HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 10 categorise patients into groups of low or subclinical vitamin B12, and possible or probable vitamin B12 Treatment pathways Patient context is important when considering treatment options. Factors such as aetiology and symptoms influence decisions concerning the dosage, frequency, and route of drug administration. Treatment guidelines vary among countries. The British Journal of Haematology guidelines developed by Devalia (2014) recommend that a patient with pernicious anaemia, malabsorption or experiencing neurological symptoms should receive 1,000 micrograms ( \u00b5g) of intramuscular (IM) hydroxocobalamin on alternate days until no further improvement is observed, with review after 3 weeks of treatment .16 Subsequently, the same dose is to be administered once every 2 months to maintain serum vitamin B12 levels. For o ther patients, administration of 1,000 \u00b5g of IM hydroxocobalamin is recommended 3 times per week for 2 weeks, followed by the same dose every 3 months as maintenance. An alternate drug, cyanocobalamin, can be delivered orally or parenterally. Hydroxocobalamin and cyanocobalamin availability and preference vary among countries.38 In Switzerland, patients with either pernicious anaemia, who have undergone gastric surgery , or are following a vegan diet typically receive either 1,000 \u00b5g of cyanocobalamin or 1,000 \u00b5g of hydroxocobalamin. Subcutaneous or IM administration is recommended on days 1, 3, and 5 (or days 1-5), then weekly for 1 month, followed by every 1 to 3 months.38 Alternatively, oral therapy with high dose vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin 1,000 \u00b5g) is also recommended.38 HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 11 3 Technology 3.1 Technology description Individuals at high risk of vitamin B12 deficiency, or who present with signs and symptoms indicative of vitamin B12 deficiency or pernicious anaemia, are currently advised to have their vitamin B12 levels evaluated.3 16 Currently, there are no restrictions around vitamin B12 testing in clinical practice in Switzerland (i.e. frequency of testing), therefore, testing is at the sole discretion of the physician. Testing of vitamin B12, holoTC , and MMA has increased significantly in Switzerland over the past decade, particularly total serum vitamin B12 ( Table 4). Consequently, the use of vitamin B12 testing is under investigation. Table 4 Number of claims and costs of various B12 tests in Switzerland, 2012 to 2019 Year 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Number of tests MMA 0 0 1 1 3 8 3,999 11,064 HoloTC 0 1 0 0 Total 684 2,321 102,196 1.3 Mio 1.6 Mio Mio Sum reimbursed (CHF) by mandatory insura nce MMA 0 0 47 56 187 376 440,603 1.2 Mio HoloTC 0 61 0 0 B12 testing thresholds for diagnosing deficiency For each test, there is no clear consensus around the most appropriate reference values and thresholds for diagnosing vitamin B12 deficiency. This lack of standardisation is likely to impact the reported diagnostic accuracy of each test in different populations and settings. Additionally, this will also influence the interpretation of test results and is therefore an important consideration when evaluating this technology. See Section 9, Table 23 for further details of current thresholds used to diagnose vitamin B12 deficiency. HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 12 3.2 Alternati ve technologies The alternative to testing is either watch- and-wait or initiation of supplementation. A watch- and-wait approach involves monitoring a patient's symptoms. A change in management will occur when there is a change in symptoms. Alternatively, physicians may initiate supplementation if the patient has risk factors or symptoms associated with B12 deficiency. In Switzerland, vitamin B12 supplementation is typically 1,000 \u00b5g delivered intramuscularly , subcutaneously, orally . The frequency and route of B12 supplementation is dependent on the type and severity of symptoms.38 3.3 Regulatory status / provider In Switzerland, total serum B12, holoTC , and MMA testing is reimbursed under mandatory health insurance through the Analysenliste (German) , Liste des Analys es (French) or Elenco delle Analisi (Italian) (Table 5). Testing is not restricted for total serum B12 or holoTC, however, MMA is used as a second- tier test which acts to confirm a prior vitamin B12 test.

For example, in 201 2 Ontario, Canada, delisted the vitamin B12 test .46 In Australia (2015) limits have been placed on the reimbursement of B12 testing, whereby s erum vitamin B12 testing is limited to one test per year, and the biomarkers holoTC or MMA may be tested when serum B12 is low or equivocal .47 In North Carolina (2019) 48 MMA and vitamin B12 testing is covered, excluding under the following circumstances: Vitamin B12 and MMA testing is not covered when screening healthy or asymptomatic patients , Hcy is not covered for vitamin B12 status confirmation, and H oloTC is not covered for screening testing or confirmation of B12. HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 13 4 HTA key questions The aim of this HTA short report was to investigate the following research question: 1. In patients with a clinical suspicion of vitamin B12 deficiency, or at high risk of vitamin B12 deficiency, is vitamin B12 (total serum B12, holoTC , and/or MMA) prior to vitamin B12 safe and effective compared to no serum B12 testing? In the absence of direct evidence on the safety and effectiveness of vitamin B12 testing, a linked evidence approach was undertaken to investigate the following research questions: 2. In patients with a clinical suspicion of vitamin B12 deficiency, or at high risk of vitamin B12 deficiency, what is the diagnostic accuracy of vitamin B12 testing? 3. In patients with a clinical suspicion of vitamin B12 deficiency, or at high risk of vitamin B12 deficiency, does vitamin B 12 testing prior to vitamin B12 supplementation change patient management (i.e. the commencement, route and frequency of supplementation), compared to no testing? 4. Do changes in patient management as a result of vitamin B12 testing impact patient outcomes? a. Do alterations in management impact patients with vitamin B12 deficiency (i.e. true positives)? b. Do alterations in management impact patients suspected of vitamin B12 deficiency who are incorrectly diagnosed (i.e. false positive and false negatives)? HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 14 5 Metho dology 5.1 Literature search 5.1.1 Databases and other sources The review methods were defined a priori in a protocol that underwent independent, anonymous peer review. Systematic literature searches were conducted to identify (a) existing SRs (search date up to 18 October 2020), and (b) primary studies addressing gaps in existing SRs addressing the research questions (search date up to 4 November 2020). The searches were performed in five biomedical databases (Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, York CRD, INAHTA HTA database). For the SR searches, a methodological search filter published by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health was used to limit the search results by publication type.49 In addition, grey literature searches were conducted on HTA agency and specialty websites. The search strategies are presented in Appendix A ( Table 26 to Table 37). 5.1.2 Inclusion and exclusion criteria The population, intervention, comparator, outcome (PICO) criteria for studies evaluating the direct effectiveness and safety of B12 testing is outlined in Table 6. No additional limits were used.

HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 15 As direct evidence was not available, a linked evidence approach was undertaken to evaluate the impact of vitamin B12 testing on patient outcomes. The first step in the linked evidence approach was to investigate the performance of the test ( Research Question 2, Table 7). Subsequently, the impact of the test outcomes on patient management was evalu ated ( Research Question 3, Table 8). The final step in the linked evidence approach was to investigate the impact of any potential changes in management on patient outcomes ( Research Question 4, Table 9). No additional limits were used.

HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 17 5.2 Study selection Studies were selected in accordance with the four separate PICO boxes presented in Table 6 to Table 9 relating to (a) direct evidence on the impact of testing on clinical outcomes , (b) diagnostic accuracy, (c) change in management , and (d) effectiveness of the change in management. For the selection of SRs, two independent revi ewers assessed all citations by title and abstract using Rayyan (Qatar Computing Research Institute),51 with disagreements settled by consensus. For the selection of primary studies, the first 300 studies were assessed by two reviewers to determine inter -rater reliability. Disagreement of <5% was defined a priori as an acceptable cut -off to justify splitting the study selection of the remaining articles by title and abstract. All artic les deemed potentially relevant were then reviewed by full text by the same two reviewers independently (VF and LA) , with disagreements settled by consensus. Where consensus could not be reached, conflicts were resolved by a third reviewer (TV). Case series including less than 10 participants were excluded. 5.3 Data extraction One reviewer independently extracted data into a standardised template, which was checked against the original study record by a second reviewer. Disagreements were settled by discussion, or by a third independent reviewer where consensus could not be reached. Data of interest included: Study information: country, year, number of institutions, study design, inclusion/exclusion criteria, withdrawals, length of follow -up, any noteworthy feat ures or limitations in the study. Demographic information: number of participants, age, sex, comorbidities, indication. Intervention and comparator: type and method of intervention/comparator (including index test, type, dose and administration route of the supplement ), concomitant interventions. Outcomes of interest: baseline, final or change from baseline scores in any of the pre- defined outcomes outlined in Table 6 to Table 9. For the purposes of this report, sensitivity and specificity were the primary diagnostic outcomes of interest.

HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 18 5.4 Risk of bias assessment Two independent researchers conducted the risk of bias assessments, with differences settled via consensus, or by an independent reviewer where consensus could not be reached. Risk of bias was assessed by different tools depending on the study design. Included SRs were appraised using the A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) checklist;52 Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network ( SIGN ) case cont rol quality checklist ,53 and cohort study quality checklist;54 diagnostic accuracy studies were appraised using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) tool ; 55 single -arm trials by the Institute of Health Economics (IHE) quality appraisal checklist for case series.56 Several items in the IHE checklist were modified to be more applicable to studies of the natural course of disease . These changes are outlined in Section 6.4.4 . 5.5 Data synthesis De novo meta- analysis was explicitly beyond the scope of this HTA short report. The results of existing reviews and primary studies included in the review have been summarised narratively. The overall strength of evidence for outcomes relating to comparative interve ntions were evaluated using the GRADE approach.57 HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 19 6 Clinical effectiveness and s afety 6.1 Summary statement clinical effectiveness and safety Direct evidence No direct evidence investigating the effectiveness of B12 testing was identified. Linked evidence Diagnostic accuracy The sensitivity of the vi tamin B12 test against MMA as a reference standard ranged from 52% to 72%, reported by one SR and meta- analysis (k = 36) , and three additional primary studies (n = 2,998) . These studies included patients with a suspected vitamin B12 deficiency . Two studies reported that 19% and 24% of patient had low B12 of an elevated biomarker (n = 1,719) , and one study reported 69% of participants fell into the grey zone of holoTC (n = 1,279) . One study exclusively included patients with neurological symptoms . Specificit y ranged from 41% to 81%. A primary study conducted in Switzerland with a large sample size of participants who had concomitant results for serum B12, MMA, holoTC, and Hcy tests (n = 11,833, of which 9 % were low or deficient of B12) . They used a novel reference standard (4cB12 method) and reported sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 78 % in identifying patients with subclinical vitamin B12 deficiency. Three primary studies that investigated holoTC against MMA as a reference standard reported test sensitivi ty ranging from 56% to 83%, and specificity from 51 % to 60%. The Swiss study that employed the 4cB12 model as a reference standard reported sensitivity and specificity of 8 6% and 81%, respectively, in possibl y deficient cases . MMA was investigated as an i ndex test by the Swiss study using the 4cB12 reference standard , and a second primary stud y using holoTC as a reference standard in patients with suspected deficiency from a natural medicin e clinic (n = 77) . These studies reported sensitivity ranges between 40% to 82 %, and specificity ranges between 83% to 94% in subclinical cases. Evidence included in the SR and meta- analysis were evaluated as having a high risk of bias . The six primary studies were generally low risk to unclear . Domains performing poorly were typically in patient selection and reference standard. GRADE was also used to assess the quality of the evidence for the Swiss study . The evidence was very low in respect to serum B12 and low for holoTC and MMA. HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 20 Change in management Two studies evaluated the impact of B12 testing on patient management and concluded that hospital patients who received a B12 test indicating low levels of B12 or MMA were not managed according to recommendations based on the test result . One study reported that MMA was used appropriately in Danish general practice clinics. Reference values for MMA were 0.05- 0.37 \u00b5mol/L for samples collected up until 30 June 1996 and 0.08- 0.28 \u00b5mol onwards. The cut off for serum B12 was <200 pmol/L. No studies regarding holoTC testing were identified. The threshold used for serum vitamin B12 deficiency was <184 pmol/L58 or <200 pmol/L.59 60 For MMA, a defined as >0.37 micromoles per litre (\u00b5mo l/L) when tested prior to June 30 1996, and >0.28 \u00b5mol/L afterwards.59 60 The studies were appraised against the IHE case series checklist. Generally , studies were evaluated as having a low to moderate risk of bias. Effectiveness of change in management In patients that are correctly identified as B12 deficient, B12 supplementation was found to be effective at achieving a clinical response. Cases that are incorrectly classified as healthy (i.e. false negatives) could face mild to severe consequences (e.g., neurological abnormalities, cognitive impairment, haematological abnormalities, complications during pregnancy). The SRs pertaining to supplementation were appraised with the AMSTAR tool . The risk of bias of the SRs ranged from low to high. The evidence base for natural history studies was appraised using a modified IHE case series checklist and SIGN quality appraisal tool. The studies generally performed with low to moderate risk of bias. 6.2 Search results The res ults of the study selection process are presented in Figure 3. The search results from each database are reported in Table 24 to Table 31, Appendix A . After the removal of duplicates, 6,919 records were screened by title/abstract. A total of 287 studies were reviewed by full text, of which 13 SRs and 38 primary studies met the inclusion criteria.

The study charact eristics of such studies are described below. 6.3.1 Diagnostic accuracy A single SR (including meta- analysis ) was included for diagnostic accuracy. This SR, authored by Willis (2011),34 searched for studies published between 1990 and November 2009 across 7 databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL/PsychINFO, Wed of Sciences, Current Contents and Informit Health Databases) see Table 38. The review included 54 primary studies, of which 36 reported outcomes appropriate for meta- analysis. The included studies were stratified within subgroups of clinical indication (patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms, previous vitamin B12 deficiencies, no defined indications, and enzyme immunoassay, radioassay, radioimmunoassay, microbiological assay). 54 studies included in the Willis SR , 13 were two -gated24 61 -72 and 41 were single- gated studies.37 73-112 The mean or median age of the patients ranged from 31 -80 years. Participants were older than 60 years in 71 % (k = 48) of studies reporting on age. Age and sex were reported in 89 % and 83% of studies, respectively. Men compris ed 55% (k = 45) of participants among included studies. Patients with a suspected vitamin B12 deficiency due to a prior investigation comprised 33% (k = 18) of studies. Studies enrolling patients with unknown vitamin B12 status were also included (39 %, k = 21). The clinical indication was not specified in 48% (k = 26) of included studies. Of the studies that presented clinical information, 3 6% (k = 10) of studies included patients with suspected or prior vitamin B12 deficiency, 25% (k = 7) of studies with neuropsychiatric (suspected or confirmed) conditions , 11% (k = 3) patients with gastric disorders, and 29 % (k = 8) of studies with some other clinical indication. In 41 % of studies, patients were enrolled in studies without knowledge of their vitamin B12 st atus. The studies were based in Australia (k = 2),64 65 Belgium (k = 2)61 99 Canada (k = 1),104 Denmark (k = 4),88 89 97 98 France (k = 1),73 Germany (k = 3),70 86 101 Hong Kong (k = 1),90 India (k = 1),105 Jordan (k = 1),83 New Zealand (k = 1),91 Norway (k = 2),75 87 South Africa (k = 1),71 Sweden (k = 7),66-69 93 94 111 the Netherlands (k = 1),110 UK (k = 6),72 81 82 84 95 112 and the USA (k = 19).24 37 62 63 74 76 78 -80 85 92 96 10 0 102 103 106 - 109 One study did not specify the country of origin.77 The included studies used MMA (k = 18) , Hcy (k = 18), HoloTC (k = 4), or clinical reference (k = 6) as reference tests . Citations were not provi ded for the studies included in the meta- analysis. The r emaining included studies used MMA/creatinine ratios, or various combinations of Hcy, MMA, and holoTC. All studies included in the SR by Willis (2011)34 used serum B12 as the index test. Various thresholds w ere used across the included studies, which are outlined in Table 45. All primary studies used vitamin B12 as an index test,33 113 -117 all but one116 looked at holoTC as an index test, and three studies also analysed MMA as an index test.33 116 117 HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 23 In total, 6 additional diagnostic test accuracy studies (n = 15,608 patients) published after the search date of the Willis (2011)34 review were included in the present review. The studies were prospective (k = 4)113 114 116 117 or retrospective (k = 2) .33 115 The diagnostic test accuracy studies were based in Switzerland (k = 1),33 the Netherlands (k = 1),113 UK (k = 1),117 or Germany (k = 3).114-116 One study did not report any patient demographics besides age.114 Across the remaining five studies, 50% of included patients were male.33 113 115- 117 All patients were aged between 19 to 100 years. The mean age was 66 years across 4 studies113 115-117 and the median age was 60 years across two studies.33 114 One study was conducted at a natural medicine clinic, which had a notably high enrolment of vegan and vegetarian participants.116 The r emaining studies did not report on the ratios of vegetarian and vegan patients to omnivorous patients. The clinical indication for the studies included sampl es referred for vitamin B12 determination,33 114 neurological or cognitive signs or symptoms of deficiency,115-117 or individuals tested for moderate, low or very low B12.113 Diagnostic thresholds for each test were variable among the included primary studies included in this report, and in the Willis review (see Appendix B , Table 45). Mean or median vitamin B12, holoTC, or MMA levels of the included participants have been summarised in Table 11. The majority of the included participants did not have measurements suggesting a vitamin B12 deficiency as in dicated by the respective reference test. The prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency in Switzerland is unknown. One study that investigated older people, found that the prevalence was 8%, 13%, and 19% in patients who were in their 60s, 70, and 80s respective ly.30 Index and reference tests for each included primary study are presented in Table 15.

Notes Values presented as mean (range) unless otherwise specified. = Median values 6.3.2 Change in management Three cross -sectional studies comprising 608 participants (51 % male)58-60 investigated changes in patient management in response to vitamin B12 (k = 1) 58 or MMA test results (k = 2) .59 60 No studies investigated the impact of holoTC testing on management decisions. The studies were located in Denmark (k = 2)59 60 and USA (k = 1).58 The median ages were 7759 and 81 years60 (ranging from 19- 98 years). Carmel (1986) provided limited data on age,58 instead reporting that 45% of participants were aged >60 years, 31% aged 40- 60 years, and 24% of participants aged <40 years.58 The threshold for B12 deficiency was <184 pmol/L58 or <200 pmol/L.59 60 For MMA, a deficiency was defined as >0.37 micromoles per litre (\u00b5mol/L) when tested prior to June 30 1996, and >0.28 \u00b5mol/L afterwards.59 60 Carmel only investigated the serum B12 test .58 HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 25 6.3.3 Effecti veness of change in management Supplementation The literature search identified eight SRs that reviewed the supplementation of vitamin B12 in patients with a vitamin B12 deficiency.8 19 32 118 -122 The year of publ ication of the included studies ranged from 2006 to 2018. The number of studies included in each SR ranged from 2 to 43 studies of varying study designs. The number of participants included in each SR ranged between 93119 and 1,277,122 with a total of 3,958 participants across all studies. The populations of interest included patients with vitamin B12 deficiency related to gastrointestinal (GI) disorders,118 patients with pernicious anaemia,19 patients before and/or after bariatric surgery,120 122 patients with neurodegenerative and/or cognitive impairment,32 and patients with a vitamin B12 deficiency.8 119 122 The age of included participants varied from 23 to 92 years, however, most patients were above the age of 65. Five of the SRs diagnosed deficiency using only serum vitamin B12 levels,19 32 118 120 122 and three SRs used serum vitamin B12, MMA , and Hcy.8 119 121 Four SRs compared oral vitamin B12 therapy to IM vitamin B12 therapy,8 19 118 119 two SRs compared various doses of oral vitamin B12,32 120 one SR compared oral supplementation to no supplementation (or a different supplementation vitam in B12 regimen),122 and one SR compared oral and IM vitamin B12 supplementation to placebo.121 Supplemental dosage of vitamin B12 ranged from 1,000 \u00b5g to 2,000 \u00b5g across the included studies. Table 12 provides a summary of study characteristics for the included SRs on the supplementation of vitamin B12 in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency. A detailed table of the included studies on the supplementation of vitamin B12 can be found in Table 40, Section 12.1, Appendix B .

HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 27 Natural course of disease Five SRs investigating the natural course of vitamin B12 deficiency were included (See Table 41).32 123- 126 The year of publication of the included studies ranged from 2003 to 2016. The number of studies included in each SR ranged from 9 to 57 studies of various study designs , including case reports, observational, case- control, cross sectional, longitudinal, cohort, placebo controlled, meta- analysis, literature review, and cell culture/invitro . The populations of interest included patients with neurodegenerative disease and cognitive impairment,32 older patients,123 healthy pregnant women,125 and women with a prior, or current neural tube defect (NTD) -affected pregnancy.124 126 In the included studies, the age of patients ranged from 18 years125 to 99 years;123 this large spread is due to one study investigating healthy pregnant women and another investigating geriatric patients. Two SRs diagnosed vitamin B12 deficiency using only serum vitamin B12;32 123 one used serum vitamin B12, MMA one used serum B12, MMA, holoTC, Hcy or testing of cord blood;125 and one used serum or plasma vitamin B12, MMA, holoTC and amniotic fluid B12.124 Thirty primary research studies investigating the natural course of vitamin B12 deficiency were also included (see Table 44). The year of publication of the included studies ranged from 1965 to 2019. Six studies were conducted in the USA,74 127-131 five studies were conducted in the Netherlands,132-136 three in Canada ,137-139 Denmark,97 140 141 and France,142-144 two in both the UK81 145 and Israel,146 147 and one each in Cyprus,148 Czech Republic,149 Finland,150 Germany,151 Ireland152 and Sweden.153 All 30 studies were observational in nature with varying study design, including 2 cross -sectional studies, 4 cohort studies, 13 case -control studies and 11 case series. The included patients were mostly older (aged 60 and above) females. One study exclusively evaluated pregnant women and their foetuses/children. To assess vitamin B12 levels, 15 studies tested only total serum B12,74 97 129 130 135 139 141 143 145 146 148 149 151-153 4 studies tested total serum B12 and Hcy ,132 136 142 144 1 study tested total serum B12 and holoTC ,133 1 study tested total serum B12 and MMA ,147 1 study tested total serum B12, methylcitric acid , Hcy and MMA ,137 1 study tested total serum B12, Hcy and MMA ,131 1 study tested only holoTC ,138 and 1 study tested only MMA.140 Five studies did not specify the t ypes of test utilised.81 127 128 134 150 HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 28 6.4 Risk of b ias 6.4.1 Systematic reviews The AMSTAR tool was used to assess the quality of reporting of the included 13 SRs.52 Five of the 13 SRs were considered to be of low risk of bias and satisfied more than 70% of AMSTAR criteria.8 34 119 122 125 Two of these low bias reviews were Cochrane reviews.8 119 Points were lost in high bias reviews for shortcomings such as the inability to combine study results (not deemed possible in three of the five SRs).8 119 122 The most common shortcomings included: an unavailable list of excluded studies, a lack of description of use of grey literature, and lack of clarity on an a priori design (providing reference to a published protocol and inclusion/exclusion criteria). Four SRs were graded 'yes' for more than 30%, but less than 70% of the criteria.118 121 123 126 All SRs included conflict -of-interest information. All four studies had an absent or only partially available list of included and excluded studies. All studies were graded down due to a lack of a priori design.118 121 123 126 Three of four did not employ duplicated study selection and data extraction.118 121 126 Four of the thirteen SRs were graded as having a high risk of bias , and satisfied <30% of the criteria . There were several shortcomings such as lacking an a priori design, lacking comprehensive literature search, inclusion of grey literature, duplicate study ex traction, or quality assessment of studies.19 32 120 124 6.4.2 Diagnostic accuracy studies For the evaluation of diagnostic accuracy from primary studies, Willis (2011)34 assessed studies using the QUADAS tool; additional prim ary studies included in the present review were evaluated using QUADAS -2. The tool evaluates risk of bias and applicability of three domains (patient selection, index test(s) and reference standard(s)), and an additional risk of bias domain (flow and timing). The evidence base included by Willis (2011)34 was graded poorly against the QUADAS criteria. Unclear spectrum bias was observed across approximately 70% of the evidence base. Verification bias was high in the included studies. Verification bias is introduced when not all samples are tested with the same reference test ; 85% and 100% of studies had low differential and incorporation bias, respectively. Due to a lack of a reference standard for vitamin B12 testing, reference tests were graded as uncertain for both applicability and risk of bias domains of the QUADAS -2 criteria. One study117 was graded as high-risk in this domain as they utilised a red cell cobalamin test , which currently appears unestablished in the lite rature. All studies were graded with a low risk of bias in flow and timing. Generally, index tests performed well for risk of bias and applicability. One study114 was judged down as their study design led to thresholds that were notably different from what is observed in the literature and clinical practice HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 29 guidelines. Two studies113 116 were judge d as having a high risk of bias due to not pre- specifying diagnostic thresholds. Evidence quality was mixed for patient selection ; three of six studies had uncertain risk of bias due to little clinical data available.33 114 115 Two studies performed poorly due to a lack of patient data.113 116 For similar reasons, two of six studies scored uncertain risk in the applicability domain.113 114 Three additional studies were judged to have a high risk of bias as the recruited samples were from subpopulations (neuropsychiatric115 or elderly117 patients). One study had a high level of vegetarian and vegan participants as they were recruited from a natural medicine- oriented clinic.116 The QUADAS -2 tool evaluation of the six diagnostic accuracy studies have been presented in Table 47, Appendix C. 6.4.3 Change in m anagement studies A quality appraisal checklist for case series studies developed by IHE was used to evaluate the risk of bias in the change in management studies , which were cross sectional by design. For further details pertaining to this evaluation, see Table 48, Appendix C . Items 7, 9, 13, 16, and 18 were considered not applicable (NA) in the evaluation of the included studies. Across the evidence base, all studies satisfied 9 of the 15 items (Table 48). These were items 1, 5, 6, 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 19. No study explicitly reported blinding of outcome assessors or reported both competing interests and sources of support. Carmel (1986) was judged as having a low risk of bias against the IHE checklist.58 The study was judged down due to recruiting in a single centre, not blinding, and not reporting on conflict of interest. Hvas (2000) was also judged as low risk of bias . Both Hvas (2000) and Hvas (2002) were retrospective and unblinded.59 60 Although the outcomes were subjectively measured, the studies used specific criteria and alternative objective measures were not available. Consequently , item 12 was considered only partially satisfied for both studies.59 60 Conflict s of interest were not reported. 6.4.4 Natural course of disease studies The quality of single- arm trials investigating the natural course of vitamin B12 deficiency was appraised using the IHE quality appraisal checklist , and the quality of case- control and cohort trials was appraised using the SIGN quality appraisal tools. Cross -sectional studies were evaluated using the case- control tool, noting the applicability of certain domains was uncertain. Thus, the assessment of bias of these studies is limited. Summaries of the risk of bias are presented in Table 49 to Table 51. For the assessment of single- arm trials, the IHE checklist was modified to better assess the natural course of disease studies. Questions relating to \"whether the intervention was clearly described\" was amended to \"whether the method of diagnos is was clearly described.\" Further, the question relating to adverse events was not applicable to the appraised study design, given interventions were not frequently utilised. HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 30 The quality and bias issues were similar across the case- control and single- arm trials. Therefore, both study designs are discussed together. Overall, the studies were of moderate quality. Studies generally stated their objectives, described the diagnostic thresholds and co- interventions appropriately, defined outcomes a priori and us ed suitable methods to assess each outcome. The conclusions were generally consistent with the results. All cohort studies appropriately and clearly addressed the aim with clearly defined outcomes and used a reliable method of measuring exposure. No study assessed or accounted for the likelihood that the subjects may have the outcome at the time of enrolment, made comparisons between full participants and those lost to follow up by exposure status, and blinding was not performed or accounted for. These studies (k = 4) were judged as moderate to high risk of bias. Key limitations related to the under -reporting of certain methodological domains and the lack of appropriate statistical tests. For example, in several trials it was not reported whether studies were prospectively or retrospectively performed or whether patients were recruited consecutively. The eligibility criteria were often limited to inclusion criteria, with few studies reporting exclusion criteria, an effect more pronounced in older publications. Most trials reported a study characteristics table; however, the variables presented were often limited to age, sex and vitamin status. It was unclear whether patients were at a similar point in the disease because comorbidities and other concurrent dis eases were not reported and vitamin B12 levels did not correlate with symptom severity. 16 Further, conflicts of interest were partially (limited to source of funding) or not stated and it was not reported whether the outcome assessors were blinded to disease status or treatments. The lack of blinding was not a substantive issue for objective outcomes such as vitamin status. However, for outcomes involving judgement (e.g. depression scores), knowledge of the disease status could potentially influence reporting. The appropriateness of the statistical analysis var ied across the included trials. Several trials attempted to correct for potential confounding variables (e.g. age and education level) using multivariate analysis, whereas others did not. These studies performed basic statistical comparisons or described t he results narratively. Lastly, the lack of power calculations (in most trials) and the absence of appropriate statistical tests, raised uncertainties as to how generalisable the results are to the broader intended population. 6.5 Applicability of evidence base to Switzerland The assessment of applicability aims to determine how generalisable the studies included in the HTA are to the Swiss context. It involves the comparison of demographic and clinical characteristics in the included trials to Swiss practice. There was limited published literature reporting the demographics of, and clinical characteristics associated with, vitamin B12 deficiency in Switzerland. An overview of the Swiss clinical characteristics are provided in Table 13. HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 31 Table 13 Characteristics of vitamin B12 testing in Switzerland Parameter Characteristics Demographics Age: older adults (>55 years)154 Sex: equal % of males and females to mostly female30 154 Comorbidities: unknown % of patients with renal failure: unknown Vitamin B12 deficiency thresholds Risch 2015 Treatment Treatment for deficiency38 IM or subcutaneous 1,000 \u00b5g of cyanocobalamin or hydroxocobalamin on day 1, 3 and 5 or days 1- 5, then once per week for 1 month and then every 1 -3 months thereafter Oral therapy also available (1,000 \u00b5g) Settings General practitioner, endocrinologist, haematologist Primary care setting or hospital Abbreviations B12 = vitamin B12, holoTC = holotranscobalamin II, IM = intramuscular, MMA = methylmalonic acid, NA = not applicable, pmol/L picomoles Diagnostic accuracy The studies included in Willis (2011)34 were from Asia, Europe, and North America, with most patients from the UK and USA. It is unclear to what extent the included patients were reflective of Swiss patients with B12 deficiency owing to an absence of published literature evaluating vitamin deficiency in Switzerland. This has important implications when considering the applica bility of the results because the accuracy of vitamin B12 tests are dependent on specific demographic factors, such as the presence of renal insufficiency and the age of the patient. Without knowing these demographic factors in Switzerland, it is unclear how applicable the results are. The thresholds for vitamin deficiency (using serum B12) used by the trials included in Willis (2011) 34 were broadly consistent with those listed in the MediX guidelines38 and those calculated by Risch HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 32 (2015).30 The thresholds used to determine B12 deficiency using MMA were variable in Willis (2011) ;34 however, they fell within the range reported in the Swiss studies. Importantly, i t was unclear to what extent the MediX guideline is utilised in, and is representative of, contemporary Swiss practice. Likewise, it was uncert ain whether the patients included in Risch (2015)30 are reflective of the general Swiss population who may be tested for vitamin B12 deficiency. 6.5.2 Change in management The change in management studies were performed in Denmark in the 2000's59 60 and USA in the 1980's.58 It is unclear to what extent these studies are applicable to the Swiss context given the absence of information specific to Switzerland. Additionally, there were likely regional and temporal differences in practice that exist between the included studies and contemporary Swiss practice. The thresholds for serum B12 deficiency were higher in the included trials compared to the MediX guideline38 and the study by Risch (2015).30 The MMA cut -off in Carmel (1986)58 and Hvas (2000 and 2002)59 60 were above those in MediX guideline38 but not Risch (2015).30 However, the revised MMA cut-off in Hvas (2000 and 2002)59 60 was similar to current Swiss guidelines . 6.5.3 Effectiveness of change in management The applicability of the change in management studies are uncertain. The trials include diverse populations with varying indications and causes of vitamin B12 deficiency. It is unclear to what extent these match the demographic profile of patients with vitamin B12 deficiency in Switzerland. The reference levels for B12 deficiency using serum vitamin B12 are similar in the primary studies and the MediX guidelines. 38 However, it was unclear whether the SRs evaluating the natural course of disease align with the guidelines as the cut -off values varied. The SRs evaluating supplementation are broadly congruent to the MediX guidelines,38 both recommend oral and IM supplementation. However, the frequency of dosing, pr eferred route of administration and indication differ. 6.6 Results: Direct evidence of clinical effectiveness No direct evidence on the effectiveness of vitamin B12 testing was identified. Therefore, a linked evidence analysis was conducted. 6.7 Results: Linked ev idence of clinical effectiveness Based on the available literature, it was not possible t o separate the results of included studies into the two key populations under investigation in this review. Therefore, the results presented in this section are predominantly reflective of a broad population of patients tested for suspected B12 deficiency . HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 33 6.7.1 Diagnostic accuracy A single SR (including meta- analysis) was identified that reviewed the diagnostic accuracy of serum vitamin B12 tests against reference tests MM A, holoTC, Hcy , and clinical diagnosis.34 Clinical reference refers to response to treatment. No SRs were identified that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of MMA or holoTC as an index test . Among all subgroups, the meta- analysis reported that the serum vitamin B12 test ha d a positive likelihood ratio close to one. This suggests the test is inefficient in differentiating between deficient and healthy patients. Low sensitivity was determined, with variable specificity (Table 14). These findings were highly heterogeneous. The meta- analysis demonstrated low sensitivity and variable specificity among all reference methods and subgroups. The estimated sensitivity was higher in two-gated studies compared to single -gated studies , and specificity was highest in single -gated studies with unknown vitamin B12 status . Sensitivity was lowest when Hcy was used as a reference test ( Table 14) . Average specificity was relatively similar across reference tests ; however , the range was highly variable (0.36 - 0.96). The v ariability of specificity was still high (0.68- 0.89) when considering only MMA and holoTC as reference tests, which are the focus of this short report. Thresholds were variable across the s tudies included in the Willis (2011) review.34 These are summarised in Appendix B , Table 45. Table 14 Sensitivity and specificity of serum vitamin B12 testing against reference tests MMA, Hcy, holoT C, and clinical reference 34 Reference standard Number of studies (number of patients) Sensitivity (95% CI) oloTC = holotranscobalamin II, MMA = methylmalonic acid, NR = not reported. Source Willis 201134 Using Hcy and MMA as reference test s, studies measuring vitamin B12 with a chemiluminescent assay performed with significantly lower sensitivity than studies performing radioassays (most commonly used). Although not a focus, findings by Willis (2011)34 suggest that age does not influence test sens itivity or specificity (contrary to previous suggestions by others) .155-157 Furthermore, they reported no influence of clinical indication or assay type on diagnostic performance. S tudies that enrolled healthy controls reported higher s ensitivities (possibly impacted by selection bias) than single -gated studies that exclusively enrolled patients with an unknown vitamin B12 status. Studies performed in general practice had low sensitivity (MMA 0.43; Hcy 0.24). HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 34 Notably, these findings were affected by the quality and limitations of the evidence base. Imperfect reference standards pose a challenge to the evaluation of diagnostic accuracy. Primary research published after 2009 was included to supplement the findings of the Willis (2011) review (k = 6).33 113 -117 Test specificity and sensitivity is greatly influenced by the selected cut -off value. Table 15 demonstrates the broad thresholds used across the primary studies and the variability of sensitivity and specificity reported . The primary studies (k = 6) found the sensitivity and specificity of the tests was generally poor when the threshold was similar to current guidelines.

Notes A Results are presented from a subpopulation with a \"possible\" or \"probable\" B12 deficiency. 6.7.2 Change in management Three change in management studies were identified.58-60 The studies addressed the role of vitamin B12 testing in clinical decision -making regarding the commencement of vitamin B12 supplementation. These comprised two groups ; Hvas (2000 and 2002)59 60 investigated management decisions in relation to plasma MMA test results ; Carmel (1986)58 investigated management decisions to serum vitamin B12 HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 36 test results . Table 43 (Appendix B ) provides a summary of results for the included change in management studies. Hvas (2000)59 addressed how plasma MMA test results were used during treatment decision- making in Denmark district hospitals. Plasma B12 cut -off values ranged from 200- 600 pmol/L in healthy patients. Plasma MMA laboratory reference ranges were 0.05 -0.37 \u00b5mol/L until 30 June 1996 and 0.08- 0.28 \u00b5mol/L thereafter. To account for renal insufficiency, plasma creatinine levels were also measured. The reference interval used was 55- 120 \u00b5mol/L. Medical records of patients with plasma MMA measurements above the plasma MMA laboratory cut -off values (n = 177) were obtained from 3 hospitals between 1995 and 1996. Plasma MMA was measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Hvas (2000)59 found that in 177 patients, no action was taken in 62% of cases based on the MMA test result (median plasma MMA = 0.46 \u00b5mol/L; this is an elevated value indicative of deficiency ). A vitam in B12 deficiency was diagnosed in 22% of cases. In 12% of patients, some action was taken without a diagnosis. If plasma MMA was above 0.99 \u00b5mol/L (well above the laboratory established reference values), 68% of physicians responded. There was also a response in 32% of patients with low plasma MMA. There was no tendency to react when plasma MMA was below 1.00 \u00b5mol/L. Plasma vitamin B12 was measured in 72% of patients. Despite returning normal plasma vitamin B12 results (61%), 18% of patients were diagnosed with a vitamin B12 deficiency. Six of 177 (3%) patients were diagnosed as non-deficient, irrespective of their results presenting a strong indication of deficiency, including plasma MMA >0.99 \u00b5mol/L and plasma vitamin B12 <200 pmol/L. Contrary to general recommendations, physicians were using plasma MMA as a primary diagnostic test. Furthermore, the plasma MMA test was ordered simultaneously with the plasma vitamin B12 test. Plasma vitamin B12 was only determined prior to a plasma MMA test in 10% of cases . The treatment pathway after MMA testing in the district hospital is depicted in Figure 4. This demonstrated\u2014in the author's judgement \u2014the extent to which diagnosed deficient patients were not followed- up for further testing. Further examinations refer to testing of plasma homocysteine, antibodies against parietal cells or IF, schilling test or dicopac test, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, or bone marrow testing. The authors judgement was based on current recommendations incorporating test results of elevated plasma MMA (until June 30 1996, >0.37 \u00b5mol/L, >0.28 \u00b5mol/L onwards Report: Vitamin B12 37 Figure 4 Pathway of vitamin B12 deficient individu als in three Danish district hospitals59 Source Hvas 200059 It is notable that this study only investigated three hospitals and may not necessarily reflect the clinical practice across all Danish hospitals. Hvas (2000)59 noted t he lack of continuity between physician and patient may contribute to inconsistent management decisions and failure to respond to increased plasma MMA. Doctors requesting tests were often different to the doctors making the evaluation. The same group (Hvas 2000)59 published a second study in 2002 examining the use of plasma MMA in general practice between 1997 and 1998.60 The study included 181 patients with MMA >0.28 \u00b5mol/L that were registered at any one of 10 practices in Aarhus County. The group searched for reactions under the same conditions as the study previously described.59 There was no reaction from general practitioners (GPs) in 29% of cases. A reaction was reported in the remaining 71% of patients. In 56% of cases vitamin B12 therapy was commenced (median MMA = 0.51 \u00b5mol/L) and MMA testing was repeated in 19 patients. There was a significant association between a reaction from a GP and plasma MMA. Unlike the findings by Hvas (2000), in a hospital setting the GPs generally followed current recommendations for beginning vitamin B12 therapy in 84% of patients with plasma MMA above the cut-off (0.44 \u00b5mol/L). Often plasma MMA was used for screening. It was suggested that patients with only sl ightly increased plasma MMA were over -treated. Carmel (1986)58 investigated 250 patients with low serum vitamin B12 levels. Patients were grouped into three categories. Group one included patients who received ade quate management (adequate investigation ruling in or out a deficiency, further workup to determine cause of deficiency, and vitamin B12 therapy begun in diagnosed individuals) ; 34% of patients belong ed to this group. Group two comprised 42% of cases where no physician action was taken after a low serum vitamin B12 measurement was obtained. To fit the criteria of 'no response', no further diagnostic testing was HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 38 performed, no supplementation commenced, and failure to note low levels in daily notes or dischar ge forms. The third group contained 24% of the cohort. These were individuals who received suboptimal management. This was defined as individuals with low serum B12, and who received inadequate or no work up. Individuals in this group sometimes received supplementation without evidence that it was required. Supplements were usually administered orally regardless of the disease aetiology. In 10 patients a single parenteral injection was administered without follow -up or long- term supplementation appointments . Eight patients received no therapy at all despite a low vitamin B12 measurement. This study did not consider renal insufficiency or creatinine values, and was published prior to the mainstream use of reference tests. The results from Carmel (1986)58 suggest that patients were not managed appropriately at this medical centre, and support findings from the Danish district hospitals assessed by Hvas 2000.59 However, Hvas (2000)59 and Carmel ( 1986 )58 reflect management in 1995- 1996 and 1983- 1984, respectively. The applicability of these findings to current practice is questionable and the limitations of these results should be considered. Hvas (2000) 59 was performed shortly after plasma MMA testing became common practice. Over the following two decades since the publication of this study, it is possible a more widespread understanding of MMA testing allows for management decisions in- line with clinica l recommendations. 6.7.3 Effectiveness of change in management Supplementation (false positive test results) Patients that receive a positive test result will be subject to B12 supplementation. In false positive cases, these patients will be subject to any pot ential safety issues associated with this treatment , with none of the potential benefits . Potential safety issues associated with vitamin B12 supplementation are discussed in Section 6.8. Supplementation (true positive test results) Patients that receive a true positive test result will be subject to supplementation therapy , in which case the benefits and harms of B12 supplementation should be considered. Eight SRs were identified relating to vitamin B12 supplementation in people at risk of, or with a clinical suspicion of , vitamin B12 deficiency.19 32 118 -122 126 The studies investigated the differences between dosage and IM and orally administered vitamin B12 supplements. In some studies, this was performed comparatively to no treatment or placebo. In participants (of varying populations) with deficient/low HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 39 vitamin B12 levels, high doses of orally admi nistered vitamin B12 was found to be as effective as IM administration in correcting vitamin B12 deficiency,8 122 prophylaxis in bariatric surgery patients,120 and treating pernicious anaemia.19 High doses of oral vitamin B12 was also found to be as effective as IM administration in achieving clinical,118 neurological,119 and haematological responses ;119 however , it was found that caution should be taken when supplementing oral vitamin B12 in patients with severe neurological manifestations as IM supplementation is the preferred method to elicit a rapid response .118 In post -bariatric and Roux -en-Y surgery patients, there was contrasting evidence between two of the reviews. Mawahar (2018)120 suggested that an oral dosage of 1,000 \u00b5g may be appropriate to prevent the development of vitamin B12 deficiency. Smelt (2017)122 suggested that 350 \u00b5g (orally administered) was sufficient. In older patients with and without vitamin B12 deficie ncy, vitamin B12 supplementation had no effect on haematocrit, MCV and RBC levels.121 Table 16 provides a summary of study characteristics for the included SRs on the treatm ent effectiveness of vitamin B12 supplementation.

However, oral treatment was cheaper. Low Abbreviations B12 = vitamin B12, k = number of = intramuscular, mg bypass, \u00b5g = micrograms. No supplementation (true negatives) Patients that receive a true negative result will avoid unnecessary supplementation. Symptomatic individuals may be followed up 1- 2 months after presentation to confirm their vitamin B12 status (See the 'test' pathway in Figure 1). The prevalence of negati ve individuals in samples from patients with suspected vitamin B12 deficiency is high (81.4% with normal MMA,114 90.4% by (incorporating serum B12, holoTC, MMA, and homocysteine test results) .33 Without testing, these symptom atic individuals will likely undergo the 'no test' pathway as depicted in Figure 1. Natural course of the disease (false negatives) Patients that receive a false negative test result will be subject to the natural, untreated course of the disease. Five SRs that investigated the natural course of vitamin B12 deficiency were included.32 123 -126 Studies found that insufficient vitamin B12 levels left untreated can lead to conditions ranging from mild to severe. Insufficient vitamin B12 levels were found to be associated with Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, Parkinson's disease and cognitive impairment,32 depression,123 and NTDs.124 126 An association was found between vitamin B12 insufficiencies and low birth weight , however, much of the effect was attributable to studies from India and may not be applicable to a broader population.125 Additionally, 30 primary research studies that investigated the natural course of vitamin B12 deficiency were also included.74 81 97 127-153 Studies reported vitamin B12 deficiency when left untreated can lead to conditions ranging from mild to severe. However, s everal studies also reported a lack of association between B12 and symptoms.

This is a safe and commonly performed procedure. The main risks associated with the vitamin B12 tests are related to their low diagnostic accuracy, leading to false negative and false positive results. Vitamin B12 supplementation may be administered by oral or IM routes. These are safe and commonly used routes for administration of medication.119 Due to the water -soluble nature of vitamin B12 supplements (in the form of hydroxocobalamin or cyanocobalamin), overdose or over -prescription is considered highly unlikely.158 The reported side effects of hydroxocobalamin and cyanocobalamin are rare, mild and temporary.159 160 Rarely, cases of anaphylaxis after supplementation therapy have been reported.161 162 Evidence from the identified five systematic reviews suggest that oral and IM therapies have equal safety.8 119 Consequently, safety concerns are low, even in the case of a false positive result. The natural progression of a vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to severe and per manent disease (see Section 6.7.3). Therefore, there are safety concerns regarding false negative results in which the patient remains untreated and the disease may progress. 6.9 GRADE summary of findings The follow ing tables ( Table 18 ,Table 19 and Table 20) summarise the overall strength of evidence supporting the key findings related to the dia gnostic accuracy of the three index tests under investigation. Outcomes related to the impact of B12 testing on management decisions are not summarised in the GRADE tables due to the absence of contemporary evidence relevant to the research question. Simil arly, the effectiveness of these management decisions (i.e. on true positive, true negative, HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 43 false positive, and false negative patients) are not reported in the GRADE tables, as they are not the main focus of the review. Evidence from primary studies of t otal B12 that was summarised in the report narratively is not represented in the GRADE tables, due to the risk of misinterpreting unweighted ranges of reported values in contrast to the results of the meta- analysis results reported by Willis (2011) .34 Instead, only the results of the Willis (2011)34 meta- analysis are reported in the summary of findings table for this index test. For the remaining index tests (i.e. holoTC and MMA) , it was not appropriate to report ranges of accuracy across the included primary studies bec ause studies used difference reference standards. Instead, the results from Campos (2020) are summarised in the summary of findings tables, as this study included the largest sample size with the most generalisable patient population ( i.e. conducted in Swi tzerland).33 Swiss -specific prevalence estimates were used to calculate the estimates for the number of results (i.e. true positives, true negative, false positives, false negatives) per 1,000 tested patients, noting that these estimates are only relevant to a general population above the age of 60.30 The estimated preval ence of B12 deficiency in other subgroups of the target population defined in the PICO (i.e. patients with suspected, or high risk of, B12 deficiency), is unknown. In addition, there are no summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity for these subgroups. Consequently, the absolute effects could not be expressed in the summary of findings table. The certainty of evidence supporting an outcome, as scored according to the GRADE approach, is defined into the following categories: 57 High certainty : We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect. Moderate certainty : We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. Low certainty : Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. Very low certainty : We have very li ttle confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.

HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 47 7 Legal, social, ethical issues 7.1 Summary statement legal issues The literature addressing legal, social and ethical issues associated with vitamin B12 testing was limited; therefore, the scope was broadened to include issues associated with vitamin tests and diagnostic tests in general. Many of these issues are likely appli cable to vitamin B12 tests, albeit the potential impact is minimised owing to the relatively innocuous nature of the t est. No legal issues associated with vitamin B12 testing were identified. Patients generally have a positive perception of vitamin B12 tests and vitamin testing more broadly. However, there was a disconnect between patients' expectations of testing and cl inical recommendations by their GPs. This sometimes led to dissatisfaction with, and distrust of the GP. Physicians acknowledge both medical and non- medical reasons for ordering vitamin B12 tests. The non-medical indications and ambiguous nature of vitami n B12 deficiency may contribute to the high rate of testing. Educational programs, updating clinical guidelines, improving patient -physician communication, and enabling longer consultations may aid in reducing unnecessary testing. All tests have a degree of uncertainty, which contributes to false negative and false positives. The harm caused by these erroneous outcomes is minimised in the context of vitamin B12 because the condition is relatively easily addressed through supplementation, treatments and test s are safe, and physicians are likely to prescribe supplementation for borderline cases of deficiency. 7.2 Methods Literature identified from systematic and non- systematic searches was used to address legal, social and ethical issues. Search terms used for t he systematic search are outlined in Appendix A , Table 34 to Table 36. The non- systematic search involved targeted searches of Google and PubMed using the systematic searches were conducted by a single reviewer, who identified 15 additional studies. A PRISMA chart was not provided, owing to the use of systematic and non- systematic searches. Results of the literature searches have been summarised using narrative synthesis. HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 48 7.3 Evidence table No studies evaluated legal issues. The assessment of ethical and social issues included 22 studies ( Table 21) consisting of primary (k = 14) and secondary (k = 8) research. Primary research studies were performed mostly in Sweden (k = 3), the Netherlands (k = 2) or Israel (k = 2), with frequently studied populations being GPs and patients with vitamin B12 deficiency. Primary research predominantly consisted of surveying or interviewing patients and physicians to ascertain attitudes, barriers and facilitators to vitamin B12 testing and treatm ents. Secondary research studies included database analyses (k = 3), published literature reviews (k = 4) , and an economic analysis of vitamin supplementation (k = 1). The reviews summarised the contemporary management of vitamin B12 deficiency , the datab ase analyses aimed to evaluate the prescribing practices of physicians , and the economic analysis evaluated the cost of switching from IM to oral supplementation. It is unclear to what extent the identified studies represent the Swiss context, owing to the lack of Swiss - specific studies and the publication dates of included trials. Several studies were published between 2000 and 2010, coinciding with the introduction of MMA and holoTC tests and oral supplementation, so it is unclear to what extent these pu blications reflect current practice. It is also unclear if studies evaluating prescribing practices in Canada are applicable to Switzerland, given management guidelines and reimbursement practices likely differ between the countries. There was limited literature addressing ethical issues associated with vitamin B12 testing and supplementation. Most studies considered the broader context of diagnostic testing. Therefore, in the absence of literature addressing vitamin B12 tests, studies discussing diagnostic testing were included. The applicability of these studies varies, as the potential harm and consequences of vitamin B12 testing is comparatively minor compared to other diagnostic tests (e.g. genetic tests) ; however, the broader implications remain releva nt and caveats are noted throughout the following section.

Thus, patients' perceptions m ay conflict with current medical recommendations suggesting patients should refrain from being tested if they are feeling well. It is unclear why patients' perceptions of vitamin testing have shifted ; however, increasing media attention has been suggested to be a key contributing factor . 167 175 Of patients referred for vitamin D or B12 testing (i.e. have presented with fatigue, depression, weight loss, myalgia or are part of a risk group) many have had negative experiences with their GP.167 Patients believed that their GP had insufficient knowledge of vitamin testing, leading to distrust and dissatisfaction. Patients were also unhappy with physicians who refrained from testi ng and would continue to request testing until they received a referral. Many patients persisted because they believed there was no suitable alternative to vitamin testing, however, other surveyed patients were satisfied if HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 51 their GP was able to sufficientl y explain why testing was not required. To improve satisfaction further, patients wanted GPs to provide more testing and pay more attention to vitamin deficiencies in practice.167 Patients indicated for vitamin testing predominately sourced their information from the internet and were willing to accept this information as it provided an explanation for their symptoms. However, they were confused by the differing thresholds for vitamin deficiency and the discordance between published guidelines. These concerns undermined their confidence in their GP because they found it difficult to accept that the GP had sourced the correct information.167 Patients with unspecified vitamin B12 deficiency were satisfied with oral supplementation and IM B12 injections with no clear preference between the two treatments.169 173 When compared to IM injections, patients receiving oral supplementation reported reduced travel and healthcare visits as key drivers of satisfaction.169 Oral supplement users further reported additional benefits of the avoidance of needles and complications associated with injections.173 Patients who preferred IM injections believed that oral therapy reduced compliance, was more inconvenient and had quest ionable efficacy.169 173 Patients with pernicious anaemia were dissatisfied with their treatment for vitamin B12 deficiency (mostly IM injections). The reasons underscoring this dissatisfaction were not reported.181 7.5.2 Physician perception of vitamin tests and treatments Vitamin B12 tests are among the most prescribed tests in clinical practice, with GPs ordering a median of two tests per week. 168 GPs acknowledge the high rate of testing and note that vitamin B12 tests cannot be performed for every case of suspected vitamin B12 deficiency.168 They are also aware of the sensitivity and specificity limitations of vitamin B12 tests.170 171 As such, GPs believed one diagnosis for every ten tests was an acceptable testing rate.170 Physicians are aware of the importance of reducing low -value healthcare, particularly vitamin B12 tests, to improve the quality and cost -efficiency of the healthcare system.167 168 However, GPs note it is difficult to convince patients to refrain from testing. One survey reported only 9% of patients could be convinced to withhold from vitamin testing. 168 GPs note low education levels and limited language capabilities are key barriers underscoring the reluctance of patients to refrain from testing.167 Additional barriers identified by GPs include inconsistent guidelin es and recommendations, the lack of association between vitamin levels and symptoms, peer attitude towards testing, and the perceptions and hype towards vitamin testing in the media.167 168 Important facilitators i dentified to reduce unnecessary testing were additional education programs, updated clinical guidelines, improved communication strategies, longer consultation times, removal of vitamin B12 tests from testing sets and feedback.167 HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 52 Physicians acknowledge there are both medical and non- medical reasons for ordering vitamin B12 tests. Medical indications for testing vitamin B12 levels include low haemoglobin, neurological symptoms or the presence of certain risk factors (e.g. vegetarian or vegan diet).167 170 171 Non-medical reasons for testing include providing reassurance to patients, acceding to patients' requests and insufficient time to discuss alternatives or justify why testing is unnecessary.167 Other physician -related factors associated with an increased propensity to prescribe vitamin B12 tests include female GP, geriatricians, larger urban clinics and greater numbers of vitamin B12 -deficient patients.163 167 170 171 174 180 There was relatively little information regarding the utilisation of vitamin B12 treatments by physicians. Despite the relatively high testing rates , it is unclear if prescriptions for vitamin B12 are equally high, with one survey noting most physicians had prescribed 10 or fewer oral vitamin B12 supplements within the previous year (noting, the number of IM B12 was not reported in the study).166 Canadian physicians preferred IM treatments compared to oral supplements, with approximately half of surveyed clinicians exclusively using IM B12, although the indication for supplementation was not reported.166 Physicians generally held positive perceptions towards oral vitamin B12 supplementation.166 Physicians who believed oral supplementation was effective thought it would reduce costs and avoid discomfort associated with injections. Additionally, p hysicians who believed oral supplementation was not efficacious raised concerns that patients would not be able or willing to pay for the medication; they noted single injections were more convenient an d likely result in higher compliance than daily tablets and they were unsure about the existing literature.166 Further, many physicians reported patients may not accept switching from injections to oral therapy and they were unsure which oral supplement to use. It is unclear to what extent these findings can be generalised to Swiss practice as oral supplementation appears to be more accepted (as inferred by its inclusion into the MediX guidelines 38) since the publication of these surveys. There was relatively little information regarding when to prescribe vitamin B12 in Switzerland. The lack of guidelines and accepted treatment thresholds compound this problem (see Section 10). When considering patients with borderline vitamin B12 deficiency, Australian GPs were in favour of initiating vitamin B12 supplementation, providing additional dietary advice and subsequent retesting. 163 GPs would not recommend or were neutral toward testing additional biomarkers. GPs who did not perceive an overuse problem and those who were more receptive to patients' requests were more likely to prescribe vitamin B12 supplements. Factors such as the sex of the physi cian, elapsed time since last vitamin B12 education and the frequency of evaluating vitamin B12 deficiency, did not influence likelihood to prescribe vitamin B12.163 HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 53 7.6 Ethical results 7.6.1 Vulnerable patient groups Malnutrition and vitamin B12 disorders are relatively common among older adults, with prevalence increasing with age.178 182 As with younger patients, symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency in older patients are relatively non- specific and often undetectable, however, the cause differs slightly.17 157 Dietary and lifestyle factors are common causes of deficiency in younger adults. In contrast, pernicious anaemia, GI disorders (gastri tis and Helicobacter pylori infections) and previous GI surgery are common factors contributing to vitamin B12 deficiency in older adults. 17 157 Vitamin B12 deficiency in older adults may increase the risk of devel oping neuropsychiatric illnesses ;157 however, it is not associated with frailty165 or mortality,177 suggesting the impact of vitamin B12 deficiency is limited. Individuals who are vegetarian or vegan are at greater risk of developing vitamin B12 deficiency because natural sources of vitamin B12 are generally limited to animal products.183 184 The incidence of vitamin B12 deficiency in these populations ranges from 0% to 81%185 and given the increasing popularity of these lifestyles,164 overall incidence is likely to increase in the coming years. Individuals who are pregnant or breastfeeding, neonates and children are also at risk of vitamin B12 deficiency.184 Vitamin B12 requirements increase during pregnancy in order to meet the nutritional demands of the mother and the foetus. Deficiency is particularly harmful during this per iod as vitamin B12 is necessary for the myelination of neurons and neurodevelopment, and deficiency can result in delayed growth. 15 Given that the presentation of vitamin B12 deficiency is relatively non- specific i n children and they are dependent on their caregiver for food, children and neonates represent a particularly vulnerable group. 7.6.2 Perceived benefits and harms of vitamin B12 testing Non- maleficence and beneficence of diagnostic tests are linked to the method of testing and the specificity and sensitivity of the test. All tests have a degree of uncertainty (see Section 6.7 for sensitivity and specificity of vitamin B12 tests), which will influence the rate of false positives and false negatives. Both misclassifications may harm the individual, with less sensitive tests likely to cause greater harm. False positives can result in further tests or treatments in otherwise healthy patients and thus expose the individual t o additional harm. 186 In vitamin B12 deficiency, the severity of false positives is relatively minor, as the harms and costs attributable to further testing (blood tests) and treatments (supplementation) are minimal. False positives may also confer psychological harm due to anxiety and stigma associated with the disorder, and cause patients to lose confidence in their medical practitioner. 186 Again, these harms are minimised because vitamin deficiencies are readily correctable using supplements. Whi le the potential for harm is low, costs associated with an incorrect diagnosis HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 54 remain, specifically, the costs associated with supplementation. This will disproportionately impact individuals of low socioeconomic status and may result in psychological harm . False negatives may result in treatments being delayed or withheld due to an incorrect diagnosis. This may result in the individual developing adverse events associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. These adverse events are often irreversible (owing to ne uronal death) and would result in ongoing disability and costs15 (see Section 6.7.3 for further details). The costs are likely exacerbated in infants and young children w ho have a longer life expectancy. If the correct diagnosis is subsequently ascertained, treatment efficacy may be altered, additional treatments may be required and the prognosis may be poorer.186 However, the harm associated with false negatives are potentially minimised for vitamin B12 deficiency given it takes several years to deplete B12 reserves, multiple testing may correct the diagnosis, physicians are likely to prescribe supplementation for borderline cases of deficiency, and deficiency can be readily addressed through supplementation.15 163 Irrespective of the result, the testi ng process itself can cause physical harm due to the test procedure or mental harm owing to the anxiety and stigma associated with the diagnosis. In the case of vitamin B12 deficiency, potential adverse effects of the test are outweighed by the potential benefit to the individual with suspected deficiency, with early diagnosis and treatment mitigating any possible complications attributable to the disorder. Treatment for vitamin B12 deficiency is relatively safe and affordable. However, patients not indicat ed for the test, are exposing themselves to additional harm \u2014 albeit relatively minor \u2014which is unlikely to improve their overall health (noting it may alleviate anxiety). HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 55 8 Organisational issues 8.1 Summary statement organisational issues If vitamin B12 testing were to be delisted or limited , physicians would likely initiate supplementation in patients at risk of, or suspected of, vitamin B12 deficiency without prior testing. This is unlikely to cause additional harm , but may increase unnecessary supplementation use. Studies have reported patients have a willingness to transition from injections to oral supplementation ; however, rates of compliance may decrease. Currently, there are no registered oral vitamin B12 products reimbursed in Switzerland. Utilisation of vitamin B12 tests and IM injections has increased over the past several years in both Switzerland and Canada. Many of the tests and treatments are considered unnecessary and may reflect the increased medicalisation of vitamins. 8.2 Methods Literature identi fied from systematic and non- systematic searches was used to address organisational issues. The search terms used for the systematic search are outlined in Appendix A , Table 37. The non-systematic search involved targeted searches of Google and PubMed using the searches were conducted by a single revie wer, who identified four additional studies. A PRISMA chart was not provided owing to the use of systematic and non- systematic searches. Results of the literature searches have been summarised using narrative synthesis. 8.3 Evidence table The assessment of or ganisational issues included primary (k = 4) and secondary research studies (k = 4) (Table 22). The primary research studies surveyed physicians or patients to identify barriers and facilitators to vitamin testing a nd gauge their willingness to transition from IM B12 injections to oral supplements. Secondary research consisted of a SR of the safety and effectiveness of vitamin B12 supplementation and retrospective analyses of databases to determine the prescribing and utilisation of vitamin B12 tests and injections in Switzerland and Canada.

For example, following an online program to reduce low -value healthcare services in the Netherlands, GPs were more likely to suggest supplementation rather than testing.167 Further, when considering a borderline case of vitamin B12 deficiency, Australian GPs were more likely to initiate supplementation and were ambivalent to, or would not recommend, further testing.163 Lastly, a survey of Swedish GPs showed that they would prophylactically treat patients at risk of vitamin B12 deficiency,171 reinforcing the notion that physicians would likely initiate supplementation if testing were HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 57 restricted. An increased rate of supplementation is unlikely to cause harm, owing to the relatively safe profile of vitamin B12.8 Increas ed supplementation may result in many patients using vitamin supplements unnecessarily. Delisting or limiting vitamin B12 tests may also switch the first -line treatment from injections to oral supplements. When surveyed, approximately 75% of patients indi cated a willingness to transition from IM to oral supplementation.169 Patients reported reduced travel time, costs , and healthcare visits as key reasons for their satisfaction with switching from IM to oral supplem entation.169 Other studies noted a transition from IM to oral supplementation would result in further healthcare savings due to reduced nursing time.179 Importantly, oral and IM vitamin B12 exhibit equivalent safety and effectiveness.8 Compliance is lower with oral therapy, however, with a survey of Canadian patients noting 92% had forgotten to take the medication in a six -month period.169 This may result in inadequate treatment and additional healthcare costs from ongoing management of the disorder. 8.4.2 Medicalisation of vitamin supplementation and testing Public interest in vitamins and vitamin testing has increased substantially over the past ten years as inferred by google trend searches for 'vitamin B12'.187 Correspondingly, there has been increased demand and prescribing of vitamin B12 tests in Switzerland.154 It is unclear if the inci dence of vitamin B12 deficiency has also increased; many tests may have been unnecessary, merely reflecting public demand. In support of this possibility, approximately 75% of surveyed GPs had ordered one or more unnecessary vitamin B12 test in the previous week. 167 In Canada, 64% of vitamin B12 injections were considered inappropriate based on the patient's symptoms and prior vitamin B12 levels.176 While the medicalisation of vitamins may improve an individual's health status, unnecessary testing and treatments can further increase healthcare expenditure. For example, in Canada, the estimated cost associated with unnecessary vitamin B12 injections was 45.6 million in 2018.176 There are several reasons underscoring this increased medicalisation, for example, increased media attention, patient awareness and willingness of physicians to maintain the patient -doctor relationship likely contribute to the over -testing and medicalisation of vitamins.167 HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 58 9 Additional issues Clinical practice guidelines ( published after 2009) were sought via non-systematic search for inclusion in this report . Guidelines published in countries similar to Switzerland are a good source of information on the management of vitamin B12 deficiency in similar populations, and may highlight notable issues similar among health care systems. Five guidelines and one expert consensus statement were identified from the literature (Table 23).3 16 31 38 188 189 Additional treatment management pathways (predominan tly from the N ational Health Service) and expert opinions were also identified; however, these were omitted because they failed to provide recommendations or did not provide sufficient explanation or evidence justifying their pathway. The guidelines were from Europe (k = 3), North America (k = 2) , and Australia (k = 1). One guideline was from Switzerland, however, it is unclear how closely this is followed in practice. Most of the guidelines and the consensus statement were reflective of adults with a clinical suspicion of, or at high risk for, vitamin B12 defic iency. One guideline evaluated suspected vitamin B12 deficiency in pregnant women. Most guidelines were in accordance with their recommendations for first -line tests, namely serum vitamin B12 tests and/or blood cell count/blood film examination. However, t here is a lack of consensus regarding second- line tests and thresholds to infer vitamin B12 deficiency. For example, several guidelines recommend plasma or serum MMA , Hcy or holoTC tests, whereas other guidelines do not mention the tests or suggest holoTC as a first -line test. It is unclear why the guidelines differ in their recommendations and it is uncertain whether it is reflective of regional differences in clinical practice. Furthermore, the diagnostic threshold to infer deficiency using serum vitamin B12 levels varies between <75 pmol/L to <178 pmol/L. Likewise, the threshold for deficiency using MMA varied in two guidelines. The reason underscoring the different threshold is uncertain, but it may relate to the different testing kits (which influences the diagnostic accuracy) or the baseline vitamin B12 in the studied population.

HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 63 10 Discussion This HTA short report aimed to evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of vitamin B12 testing. The tests under investigation included vitamin B12, holoTC or MMA tests of patient serum, plasma or urine. The review focused on initial testing to diagnose a vitamin B12 deficiency, rather than follow -up or monitoring tests. The safety an d effectiveness of vitamin B12 supplementation was compared to no supplementation. Clinical management decisions regarding the route and frequency of the therapy were considered out of the scope of this report. Across the evidence base, the serum vitamin B 12 test was accepted as imperfect and prone to confounding factors. Additionally, inconsistencies within the literature were well recognised. The holoTC test has been proposed as a possible replacement as a first -line test to improve diagnostic accuracy in women >50 years.33 Regardless of the first -line test, the total vitamin B12 or holoTC test often need to be supported with second- line testing in order to obtain highly sensitive and specific test results. ROC analyses report ed highly variable sensitivities and specificities within the literature.34 In sum mary , the sensitivity and specificity of each of the test vary widely and there is no general agreement on the type of reference standards to be used. Published summary estimated of sensitivity and specificity for serum vitamin B12 tests are hardly interpr etable, in part due to the wide range of thresholds used and high concerns regarding applicability. It may be reasonable to use a sequential testing strategy involving several tests to reduce misclassifications, but such strategy has not yet been formally evaluated. Studies evaluating how vitamin B12 tests affect management decisions in practice compared to current recommendations were examined in this report. Two primary studies suggested that the decisions made by health practitioners were not significant ly influenced by the measured vitamin B12 level. 58 59 Often the doctor did not follow official recommendations and proceeded to supplement (or not) irrespective of the test result. In contrast, a single study based across 10 GPs found that vitamin B12 tests were considered and significantly influenced clinical management decisions.60 There is ongoing debate in the literature regarding the route and frequency of supplementati on, however this is not a focus of the report. Vitamin B12 supplementation was demonstrated as an effective treatment of a vitamin B12 deficiency in populations with vitamin B12 deficiency resulting from GI disease, pernicious anaemia, or of unspecified cause. The natural course of the disease can lead to an array of conditions ranging from mild to severe and permanent. A considerable portion of the evidence base was focused on the progression of deficiency in pregnant women and in infants. HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 64 10.1 Comparison to pr ior reviews and HTA reports The Australian Government Department of Health (2014)190 produced an HTA for the assessment of vitamin B12 testing. This HTA relied primarily on the Willis (2011)34 review described in the current report. In summarising the evidence, the HTA noted that the diagnosis of conditions potentially amenable to vitamin B12 supplementation on the basis of a single serum vitamin B12 test is not an accurate way to identify those who are deficient. In terms of the performance of the holoTC test, the Australian Government Department of Health (2014) drew on nine primary studies that compared the performance of holoTC to that of total vitamin B12 for identification of patients with vitamin B12 deficiency.190 All studies but one reported that the holoTC test's performance was comparable to, or better than, that of the vitamin B12 test, although a number of limitations were identified. The conclusion was that the evidence was insufficient to establish holoTC testing as an alternative to either total serum vitamin B12, or levels of MMA or Hcy in the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency. Hvas (2003),191 the Danish group that contributed to change in management studies to this report,59 60 subsequently published an HTA. The report was based on their prior publi cations reporting on the clinical utility of MMA in Denmark. They concluded that Vitamin B12 and MMA testing rates increased despite a lack of evidence regarding their clinical benefits. Hvas (2002 and 2000)59 60 describes MMA testing as technically accurate but limited, as age and renal insufficiency are strong confounding factors. The test has a high sensitivity but uncertain specificity . The report emphasised that MMA was not effective as a first -line test, howev er this was based on short -term studies. Findings from the Australian and Danish HTAs support the conclusions drawn in this current report. 10.2 Limitations in the included SRs 10.2.1 Diagnostic accuracy Willis (2011)34 was judged as having a low risk of bias . The review did not discuss the likelihood of publication bias Table 46 . The review was limited by the poor quality of the included studies (as assessed by the QUADAS tool) , by restricted inclusion of English published literatur e, and by the statistical model used to obtain summary estimates for sensitivity and specificity while insufficiently accounting for threshold differences. 10.2.2 Change in management An HTA by Hvas (2003)191 was judged to have a high risk of bias against the AMSTAR criteria (28%). T he study performed a comprehensive literature search, and a list of included studies along with the study characteristics were provided, but was limited in all other domains. This demonstrated that primary studies were required to further support the findings Table 46. HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 65 10.2.3 Effectiveness of change in management studies Four of the 13 SRs satisfied more that 70% of the AMSTAR criteria.8 119 122 125 Four of the 13 SRs performed poorly against the AMSTAR checklist, and satisfied less than 30% of criteria.19 32 120 124 In the SRs that assessed the natural course of vitamin B12 defi ciency, the threshold to diagnose a vitamin B12 deficiency differed, with two of the studies defining deficiency to be a serum vitamin B12 level <150 pmol/L,32 126 whereas the other three studies did not provide this information. A common confounding factor across the three SRs that focused on maternal vitamin B12 status,124-126 was that maternal folate status was not adjusted for in the included studies, which could confound the results. In the SRs that assessed the supplementation of vitamin B12, there was substantial heterogeneity, as methods of administration, dosage , and follow -up duration differed. Of note, the cut -off to define vitamin B12 deficiency differed across each SR. Three of the included SRs included very few studies ,8 119 121 making the results less generalisable to the populations of interest that were investigated. Additionally, a common limitation reported in multiple SRs was the small sample sizes of the included studies and lack of standardised reporting of outcome measures. 19 119 122 10.3 Limitations in the primary studies Across all domains of the linked analysis, the patient populations included in the studies could not be easily separated according to the two defined groups outlined in this review, namely, patients being tested based on a clinical suspicion of B12 deficiency, and those at a high risk of B12 deficiency. The patient populations in the included studies were largely from samples of patients tested without a defined reason for testing. 10.3.1 Diagnostic accuracy Comparison of sensitivity and specificity of B12, holoTC , and MMA tests among studies is limited due to variabl e thresholds and reference standards used. There is a trade- off relationship between sensitivity and specificity at different thresholds. Consequently, thresholds for both the index test and the reference standard should be the same or very similar among s tudies to allow for the interpretation of summary point estimates of sensitivity and specificity . However, this was not the case among the identified evidence base, leading to a degree of uncertainty. Two diagnostic accuracy studies used reference tests w ith unestablished internal validity (red cell cobalamin test and 4cB12 model). Furthermore, the 4cB12 model incorporates all four tests for vitamin B12 and its biomarkers (B12, holoTC, MMA , and Hcy). Thus, there is overlap between the reference test and index test. While Campos (2020) 33 included a large sample size, the lack of clinical data about the population increased the risk of bias. The inclusion criteria required all four tests to have been performed simultaneously on the samples. This potentially selects for participants with a particular presentation of HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 66 disease which lead to a deviation from the recommended testing cascade. The study design allowed for the direct comparison of index tests and allowed the effects of age as a confounding factor to be mitigated. Diagnostic accuracy studies gener ally did not exclude samples/participants based on creatinine value or kidney function (excluding two of six studies).113 116 However, abnormal renal function was often noted as a confounding factor ,33 and in three studies the effects of kidney function on the diagnostic accuracy was investigated.114 115 117 Clinical data was not always available or reported among the six studies. Pernicious anaemia anti -IF antibodies can interact with the assays, affecting sensitivity and specificity of the tests. For this reason, the proportion of patients included with anti -IF antibodies may be significant. Similarly, in no case was haptocorrin deficiency investigated, likely due to the lack of clinical data available. However, it was occasionally raised as a confounding factor.33 117 Clinical data was limited for most studies. This was a limitation as testing thresholds were variable among patient groups. Most studies recruited a large sample size; however, Schwarz (2015)116 included a small sample size (n = 77). The smaller sample size for this study limit ed the impact of the findings. Two studies performed their analyses retrospectively.33 115 Just one of six studies recruited patients from multiple centres.113 10.3.2 Change in management The results of this component of the link ed evidence were limited due to the small volum e of studies focusing on change in management that were identified, and the age of the studies. Although the studies were generally of good quality, these limitations common among the studies limit the generalisability of the findings. 10.3.3 Natural course of d isease The primary studies investigating the natural course of vitamin B12 generally did not report whether they were prospectively or retrospectively performed, or whether consecutive patients were recruited into the trial. Additionally, very little infor mation was provided to decipher whether the included participants were at a similar point in the disease being investigated, though all used a predefined criterion to diagnose vitamin B12 deficiency. Depending on the nature of the study, some studies repor ted their results narratively, and other reporting resulting using basic statistical comparison. Lastly, the lack of power calculations (in most trials) and the absence of appropriate statistical tests raised uncertainties as to how generalizable the resul ts are to the broader intended population. 10.4 Methodological limitations The number of patient subgroups who undergo vitamin B12 testing is extensive and often non- specific. Consequently, they were not able to be separated and, for the purpose of this review , have been pooled HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 67 as a broad population of individuals who require vitamin B12 testing due to clinical suspicion or being at risk of a vitamin B12 deficiency. Due to the outcomes reported in the included studies, it was not possible to update the meta- analysis performed by Willis (2011).34 No meta- analysis could be performed on the six primary accuracy studies published after the inclusion period of the Willis review (November 2009). Consequently, the conclusions of the evidence base drawn from narratively descri bed outcomes may be limited. The Willis (2011) review focuses on serum B12 tests only .34 Therefore, holoTC or MMA publications prior to 2009 may not have been captured; however, a non-systematic search for studies published prior to 2009 was performed to evaluate the risk of missing studies, and no studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria were identified. The evidence- base for diagnostic accuracy and change in management studies does not specify whether testing of the patient was an initial test or prompted by m onitoring of at -risk patients. Additionally, study characteristics were scarcely described. The inclusion criteria were limited to studies published in English, German, French or Italian with an English abstract. Consequently, studies published in other languages may have been missed in the screening process. 10.5 Legal, social, ethical and organisational issues The social and organisational issues were relate d to the medicalisation of vitamins. Over the past 10 years the public's awareness of vitamin supplementation has increased.187 The increased awareness reflects the positive portrayal of vitamin supplements in the media192 and the pervading view that supplementation is necessary for maintaining a healthy lifestyle in the general population.167 175 These factors have fostered a positive perception of vitamin B12 testing among patients and has likely contributed to the increased demand for vitamin testing. However, it is unclear whether the incidence of vitamin B12 defi ciency has increased. Physicians acknowledged the increased demand and utilisation of vitamin B12 tests and admitted finding it difficult to convince patients to refrain from testing (which often results in negative experiences for patients). 167 168 This further increases the number of unnecessary tests. However, physicians also note that complying with a patient's request has some merit because providing non- indicated tests strengthens their relationship with the patient.167 Strategies to reduce unnecessary testing in practice relate to improved educational resources and guidelines, longer consultation times , and removal of vitamin B12 tests from testing sets.167 If vitamin B12 tests were limited, physicians would likely initiate supplementation earlier in the treatment pathway. This would likely reduce healthcare expenditure but likely increase out -of-pocket costs for the patient bec ause oral supplementation is only reimbursed in Switzerland as a b- complex cocktail or multivitamin .38 There is no reimbursed mono- B12 oral supplement. Importantly, patients are satisfied with treatments for vitamin B12 (including oral and IM).169 173 Patients who prefer oral supplements report reduced travel and healthcare visits and the avoidance of painful injections as key drivers of their HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 68 satisfaction. Whereas patients who prefer IM supplementation noted oral therapy reduced compliance, was more inconvenient and had questionable efficacy.169 173 The key ethical concern related to the uncertainty associated with diagnostic tests. The sensitivity and specificity of vitamin B12 tests are variable (see Section 6 ), resulting in false positives and false negatives and thus erroneous diagnoses. Incorrect diagnoses potentially harm patients, as they may develop adverse events owing to an untreated illness or they may undergo unnecessary treatments and tests.186 In the context of vitamin B12 deficiency, the potential f or harm owing to a false positive result is relatively minor. For example, subsequent blood tests and treatments (supplements) are safe and relatively innocuous.8 False negative results have the potential to cause harm if the vitamin deficiency remains untreated owing to the development of severe adverse events (e.g. polyneuropathy, peripheral nerve dysfunction and sensory deficits). However, given physicians are likely to prescribe supplements for borderline cases,163 it takes several years for vitamin B12 levels to deplete, and vitamin deficiency is relatively easily addressed through supplementation, the potential for harm owi ng to false negatives is reduced.15 HTA Short Report: Vitamin B12 Testing 69 11 Conclusions Vitamin B12 tests reported moderately low sensitivity and specificity. The diagnostic accuracy was variable among the evidence base due to the reference tests and patient populations included. In patients with subclinical deficiency, vitamin B12 specificity was relatively similar between the Willis (2011)34 review and the Swiss study by Campos (2020) .33 Sensitivity was comparatively reduced in results by Willis (2011), particularly when MMA was used as a reference test. The reported susceptibility of the tests to confounding factors such as age and renal function was variable.33 34 The current evidence does not inform the most appropriate test, or combination of tests , to investigate a patient with suspected, or high risk of, B12 deficiency, nor the utility of such tests on impacting patient outcomes. Due to the variable accuracy and utility of the individual index tests in the testing cascade, and the absence of an accepted reference test, designing an ideal diagnostic accuracy study is challenging. Therefore, the most useful study design to address this research question would be a randomised controlled trial, in which patients are randomised to receive testing (all tests, f ollowing the recommended testing cascade) or no testing, with patients in both groups followed- up over time to measure the impacts of differing treatment strategies on patient -relevant outcomes . In the absence of such evidence, further research into the optimal reference standard is needed in order for the diagnostic validity of different diagnostic pathways to be rigorously evaluated. Vitamin B12 and MMA tests did not seem to change patient management in hospitals, however, they were used in decision- makin g in GP clinics. These findings were limited as they were from a small evidence base and over two decades old. Furthermore, how accurately the Danish and USA healthcare systems reflect Swiss healthcare during the testing cascade remains unclear. No study addressing holoTC testing was identified. In patients that are correctly identified as B12 deficient, B12 supplementation was found to be effective at achieving a clinical response. Cases that are incorrectly classified as healthy (i.e. false negatives) cou ld face mild to severe consequences (e.g., neurological abnormalities, cognitive impairment, haematological abnormalities, complications during pregnancy). Cases that are correctly identified as true positives could avoid unnecessary supplementation. The m ain social and organisational issues were related to the medicalisation of vitamins and the subsequent rise in unnecessary testing. To reduce unnecessary testing, physicians propose improved education resources, longer consultation times and removal of vit amin B12 tests from grouped testing kits. The ethical concerns related to erroneous diagnoses owing to false positives and false negatives. The impact of these erroneous outcomes is minimised in the context of vitamin B12 deficiency because supplements and blood tests are relatively safe and it takes several years for vitamin B12 reserves to deplete.
