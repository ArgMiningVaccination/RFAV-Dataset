The number of people with asthma and the death rate from this condition have been increasing since the late 1980s. Environmental pollution may be one of the causes of this growing epidemic. Work exposure to flour or cotton dust, animal fur, smoke, and a wide variety of chemicals has been linked to increased risk of asthma.1 Findings from animal and human studies confirm that DTP (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis) and tetanus vaccinations can induce [ allergic ](topic.jhtml?docId=hn-1006005#hn-1006005-need-to-know) responses,2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 and can increase the risk of allergies, including allergic asthma. An analysis of data from nearly 14,000 infants and children revealed that having a history of asthma is twice as great among those who were vaccinated with DTP or tetanus vaccines than among those who were not.7 Symptoms An asthma attack usually begins with sudden fits of wheezing, coughing, or shortness of breath. However, it may also begin insidiously with slowly increasing manifestations of respiratory distress. A sensation of tightness in the chest is also common. Healthy Lifestyle Tips Being overweight increases the risk of asthma.8 Obese people with asthma may improve their lung-function symptoms and overall health status by engaging in a [ weight-loss ](topic.jhtml?docId=hn-1054002#hn-1054002-need-to-know) program. A controlled study found that weight loss resulted in significant decreases in episodes of shortness of breath, increases in overall breathing capacity, and decreases in the need for medication to control symptoms.9 Holistic Options A set of breathing exercises called Buteyko breathing techniques has been reported to significantly reduce the need for prescription drugs for people with asthma.10 Although the people in this controlled trial experienced an improved quality of life while doing these exercises, objective measures of breathing capacity did not improve, despite the decreased need for drugs. Antibiotic use during the first year or two of life has been associated with an increased risk of asthma in preliminary studies.11 , 12 Whether this association might result from [ allergic ](topic.jhtml?docId=hn-1006005#hn-1006005-need-to-know) versus non-allergic effects remains unknown. However, the association does suggest that, until more is known, gratuitous use of antibiotics in early childhood (e.g., to inappropriately treat viral diseases) should be reconsidered. Of course, the appropriate use of antibiotics in the treatment of [ infections ](topic.jhtml?docId=hn-1038000#hn-1038000-need-to-know) as necessary should not be avoided. Concerns should be discussed with the prescribing physician. [ Acupuncture ](topic.jhtml?docId=hn-2936000#hn-2936000-001) might be useful for some asthmatics. Case reports13 , 14 and preliminary trials15 , 16 , 17 have suggested acupuncture may be helpful for people with asthma, either as a treatment for an acute attack or as a longer term therapy for reducing the number or severity of attacks, decreasing the need for medications, and so on. Placebo-controlled trials using sham (\"fake\") acupuncture, however, have been quite contradictory, many of them showing a strong placebo effect that is not significantly improved upon by real acupuncture.18 , 19 , 20 , 21 It is possible that needle insertion in non-acupuncture points has a stimulating effect that benefits asthma. The success of acupuncture may also depend on other factors, such as the type of asthma being treated and certain characteristics of the patient. Nonetheless, since some controlled research has demonstrated positive effects of real acupuncture, people with asthma may want to consider a trial of acupuncture treatment to see if it helps their individual cases. [ Chiropractic ](topic.jhtml?docId=hn-2943006#hn-2943006-001) physicians have reported that manipulation may be helpful for patients with asthma.22 , 23 , 24 In a controlled study, chronic asthmatics received either real or sham chiropractic manipulations for four weeks, after which the treatments were switched for another four weeks. No improvement in measurements of lung function was found at the end of the study. In addition, while both the manipulation and the sham treatment groups reported significant decreases in asthma frequency and severity, there were no differences between the treatments.25 A larger controlled study compared chiropractic manipulation to sham manual treatments in children whose asthma was still a problem despite usual medical management.26 Both groups experienced a significant decrease in symptoms and need for medication, as well as small increases in ability to breathe. These benefits lasted for four months after the treatments were discontinued. Although there was no additional benefit of chiropractic compared to the sham treatments, it is possible that improvements in both groups were real, rather than placebo effects. The sham therapy, which consisted of \"soft tissue massage and gentle palpation [touching],\" may have had real effects. More research is needed to address this confusing issue. [] Eating Right The right diet is the key to managing many diseases and to improving general quality of life. For this condition, scientific research has found benefit in the following healthy eating tips. |Recommendation||Why| |Get your vitamin C|| | Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that may protect against asthma. Children with asthma have been shown to wheeze significantly less if they eat lots of vitamin C-rich fruit, such as citrus fruit, strawberries, and currants. |Try a vegan diet|| | A vegan diet in conjunction with other dietary changes\u2014such as avoiding caffeine, sugar, salt, and chlorinated tap water\u2014can lead to improvements. A vegan (pure vegetarian) diet given for one year in conjunction with many specific dietary changes (such as avoidance of |Watch the salt|| | Too much salt may aggravate asthma symptoms, particularly in men. Cutting back may help keep airways clear. Studies suggest that high salt intake may have an adverse effect on asthma, particularly in men. In a small, preliminary trial, doubling salt intake for one month led to a small increase in airway reactivity (indicating a worsening of asthma) in men with asthma, as well as in non-asthmatics. Several double-blind trials have provided limited evidence of clinical improvement following a period of sodium restriction. It is difficult to compare the results of these studies because they used different amounts of sodium restriction. However, they consistently suggest that increased dietary sodium may aggravate asthma symptoms, especially in men. |Look at food additives|| | Some asthmatics react to food additives and chemicals. A doctor or an allergist can help determine if you are chemically sensitive. Some asthmatics react to food additives, such as sulfites, tartrazine (yellow dye #5), and sodium benzoate, as well as natural salicylates (aspirin-like substances found in many foods). A doctor or an allergist can help determine whether chemical sensitivities are present. |Uncover food allergies|| | Unrecognized food allergy can aggravate asthma. Try an elimination diet to uncover potential problem foods. A healthcare professional must supervise this test because it is possibile to trigger a severe asthma attack during the reintroduction. Although most people with asthma do not suffer from [] Supplements [What Are Star Ratings?](#HwStarRatingExplanationWrapper) Our proprietary \"Star-Rating\" system was developed to help you easily understand the amount of scientific support behind each supplement in relation to a specific health condition. While there is no way to predict whether a vitamin, mineral, or herb will successfully treat or prevent associated health conditions, our unique ratings tell you how well these supplements are understood by some in the medical community, and whether studies have found them to be effective for other people. For over a decade, our team has combed through thousands of research articles published in reputable journals. To help you make educated decisions, and to better understand controversial or confusing supplements, our medical experts have digested the science into these three easy-to-follow ratings. We hope this provides you with a helpful resource to make informed decisions towards your health and well-being. 3 Stars Reliable and relatively consistent scientific data showing a substantial health benefit. 2 Stars Contradictory, insufficient, or preliminary studies suggesting a health benefit or minimal health benefit. 1 Star For an herb, supported by traditional use but minimal or no scientific evidence. For a supplement, little scientific support. |Supplement||Why| | | 2 Stars Amrita Bindu 250 to 500 mg twice per day | | Amrita Bindu is an Ayurvedic herbal preparation shown to have antioxidant activity. In one study, some children with severe asthma who received amrita bindu were able to stop their asthma medications and were no longer having asthma attacks. Amrita Bindu is an Ayurvedic herbal preparation that contains a mixture of 13 salts and spices. It has been shown to have | | 2 Stars Beta-Carotene 64 mg a day of natural supplement | | Some researchers have suggested that exercise-related asthma attacks might be caused by free-radical damage caused by the exercise. Supplementing with beta-carotene, an antioxidant, protects against free-radical damage and may prevent these attacks. Caution: Synthetic beta-carotene has been linked to increased risk of lung cancer in smokers. Until more is known, smokers should avoid all beta-carotene supplements. Some researchers have suggested that asthma attacks triggered by exercise might be caused by free-radical damage caused by the exercise. | | 2 Stars Boswellia 300 mg three times per day of a resin extract | | In one trial, people with acute bronchial asthma who took powdered boswellia resin extract had significantly fewer asthma attacks and improved measurements of breathing capacity. One double-blind trial has investigated the effects of the | | 2 Stars Butterbur Adults: 50 mg three times per day for adults; children: 50 to150 mg per day, depending on body size | | In one study, asthma patients taking inhaled steroids who also took butterbur extract saw significant improvement in airflow. In a double-blind study, adult asthma patients taking inhaled steroids took either | | 2 Stars Fish Oil Consult a doctor | | Research shows that fish oil partially reduces reactions to allergens that can trigger asthma attacks. It has also been shown in one study to prevent exercise-induced asthma attacks. Double-blind research shows that | | 2 Stars Green-Lipped Mussel 50 mg of omega-3 fatty acids twice per day | | In a study of people with asthma, supplementing with a proprietary extract of New Zealand green-lipped mussel (Lyprinol) significantly decreased wheezing and improved airflow. In a double-blind study of people with asthma, supplementation with a proprietary extract of New Zealand green-lipped mussel (Lyprinol) twice a day for 8 weeks significantly decreased daytime wheezing and improved airflow through the bronchi. Each capsule of Lyprinol contains 50 mg of omega-3 fatty acids. | | 2 Stars Holy Basil 500 mg three times per day | | Animal studies have found that extracts of holy basil help keep the bronchial airway passages clear. In two trials, asthma patients who took holy basil had better breathing function and fewer attacks. Animal studies have found that extracts of | | 2 Stars Ivy Leaf 25 drops of a leaf extract twice per day | | A study involving children with bronchial asthma suggested that ivy leaf was effective in increasing the amount of oxygen in the lungs. A controlled trial on children with bronchial asthma suggested that 25 drops of | | 2 Stars Lycopene 30 mg daily | | Lycopene, an antioxidant found in tomatoes, helps reduce exercise-related asthma attacks. | | 2 Stars Magnesium 300 to 400 mg daily | | People with asthma frequently have low magnesium levels. Supplementing with the mineral might help prevent asthma attacks because magnesium can prevent bronchial spasms. | | 2 Stars Picrorhiza 400 to 1,500 mg of powdered root per day | | Two preliminary trials have shown picrorhiza to improve asthma symptoms. Two preliminary trials have shown | | 2 Stars Pycnogenol 1 mg per pound of body weight per day, in two divided doses | | In one trial, supplementing with Pycnogenol improved lung function and asthma symptoms and reduced the need for rescue medication in children with asthma. In a double-blind trial, supplementing with Pycnogenol significantly improved lung function and asthma symptoms and significantly reduced the need for rescue medication in a group of children (ages 6 to 18 years) with asthma. In contrast, no significant changes were seen in the placebo group. The amount of Pycnogenol used was 1 mg per pound of body weight per day, in two divided doses, for three months. | | 2 Stars Saiboku-to Refer to label instructions | | In preliminary trials, saiboku-to, a traditional Japanese herbal formula with numerous anti-inflammatory actions, has been shown to reduce asthma symptoms and the need for steroid medication. In three preliminary trials on people with asthma, a traditional Japanese herbal formula known as saiboku-to has been shown to reduce symptoms and enable some people to reduce their use of steroid medication. Saiboku-to has been extensively studied in the laboratory and has been shown to have numerous anti-inflammatory actions. Some of these studies used 2.5 grams three times per day of saiboku-to. A traditional Chinese or Japanese medicine practitioner should be consulted for more information. Saiboku-to contains | | 2 Stars Selenium 100 mcg daily | | Asthma involves free-radical damage that selenium might protect against. In one trial, supplementing with sodium selenite (a form of selenium) improved symptoms in some patients. People with low levels of | | 2 Stars Tylophora 150 to 400 mg daily of powdered leaf | | Tylophora has been shown to benefit people with asthma in a variety of ways, including relieving asthma symptoms, increasing the lungs' capacity for oxygen, and reducing nighttime shortness of breath. Different preparations of | | 2 Stars Vitamin B6 100 to 200 mg daily | | Vitamin B6 deficiency is common in asthmatics. Supplementing with the vitamin may decrease the frequency and severity of asthma attacks. | | 2 Stars Vitamin C 1,000 to 1,500 mg daily | | Supplementing with vitamin C reduces the tendency of the bronchial passages to go into spasm, an action that has been confirmed in double-blind research. Supplementation with 1 gram of | | 2 Stars Vitamin D 1,200 IU per day for 15 to 17 weeks | | One study found that daily supplementation with vitamin D during the winter months significantly reduced the amount of times the children experienced asthma attacks. In a double-blind study of Japanese children (average age, ten years), supplementation with 1,200 IU per day of vitamin D for 15 to 17 weeks during the winter significantly reduced the incidence of asthma attacks compared with a placebo. In another double-blind study, however, vitamin D (2,000 IU per day for 15 weeks) did not provide any clear benefit in children with asthma. Vitamin D has not been found to be beneficial for adults with asthma. | | 1 Star Betaine Hydrochloride Refer to label instructions | | Used under medical supervision, betaine HCl may help restore stomach acid levels and improve asthma symptoms. A study conducted many years ago showed that 80% of children with asthma had hypochlorhydria ( | | 1 Star Bromelain Refer to label instructions | | Bromelain reduces the thickness of mucus, which may be beneficial for people with asthma. | | 1 Star Coleus 50 to 100 mg of an extract standardized to 18% forskolin, taken two to three times per day | | One trial found that a constituent of coleus, called forskolin, when inhaled, could decrease lung spasms in asthmatics. A small double-blind trial found that a constituent of | | 1 Star Elecampane Refer to label instructions | | Elecampane has been used traditionally to treat coughs associated with asthma. Traditionally, herbs that have a soothing action on bronchioles are also used for asthma. These include | | 1 Star Ginkgo Refer to label instructions | | Supplementing with the herb Ginkgo biloba may improve asthma, as its extracts block the action of a compound that contributes to asthma symptoms. | | 1 Star Hyssop Refer to label instructions | | Hyssop, which has a soothing effect on bronchioles, has traditionally been used for asthma. Traditionally, herbs that have a soothing action on bronchioles are also used for asthma. These include | | 1 Star Khella Refer to label instructions | | Khella is considered an anti-spasmodic. Though it is not strong enough to stop acute asthma attacks, it has been recommended by German herbal medicine practitioners for chronic asthma symptoms. Eclectic physicians\u2014doctors in turn-of-the-century North America who used herbs as their main medicine\u2014considered | | 1 Star L-Carnitine Refer to label instructions | | In a double-blind trial, supplementing with L-carnitine improved lung function and overall asthma control, compared with a placebo, in children with asthma. In a double-blind trial, supplementing with L-carnitine (1,050 mg each morning for six months) improved lung function and overall asthma control, compared with a placebo, in Egyptian children with asthma. | | 1 Star Licorice Refer to label instructions | | Licorice, which has a soothing effect on bronchioles, has traditionally been used for asthma. Traditionally, herbs that have a soothing action on bronchioles are also used for asthma. These include | | 1 Star Lobelia Refer to label instructions | | Lobelia has been used traditionally to treat coughs and spasms in the lungs from all kinds of causes. Eclectic physicians\u2014doctors in turn-of-the-century North America who used herbs as their main medicine\u2014considered | | 1 Star Marshmallow Refer to label instructions | | Marshmallow, which has a soothing effect on bronchioles, has traditionally been used for asthma. Traditionally, herbs that have a soothing action on bronchioles are also used for asthma. These include | | 1 Star Molybdenum Refer to label instructions | | The trace mineral molybdenum helps the body detoxify sulfites, which can trigger asthma attacks. In some people with asthma, symptoms can be triggered by ingestion of food additives known as sulfites. Pretreatment with a large amount of | | 1 Star Mullein Refer to label instructions | | Mullein, which has a soothing effect on bronchioles, has traditionally been used for asthma. Traditionally, herbs that have a soothing action on bronchioles are also used for asthma. These include | | 1 Star Onion Refer to label instructions | | Onion may act as an anti-inflammatory in people with asthma. | | 1 Star Quercetin Refer to label instructions | | Quercetin, a flavonoid found in many plants, has an inhibiting action on lipoxygenase, an enzyme that contributes to problems with asthma. | | 1 Star Thymus Extracts Refer to label instructions | | A thymus extract known as thymomodulin has been shown to improve the symptoms and course of asthma, presumably as the result of restoration of proper immune function control. The oral administration of a | | 1 Star Vitamin B12 Refer to label instructions | | In some people, asthma symptoms can be triggered by ingesting sulfites, a food additive. Pretreatment with a large amount of vitamin B12 reduced some children's asthmatic reaction to sulfites in one trial. In some people with asthma, symptoms can be triggered by ingestion of food additives known as sulfites. Pretreatment with a large amount of | | 1 Star Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and Selenium Refer to label instructions | | There is some evidence that a combination of antioxidants vitamin E, vitamin C, and selenium may help prevent asthma thought to be caused by air pollution. There is some evidence that combinations of antioxidants such as vitamin E, vitamin C, and selenium may help improve symptoms of asthma throught to be caused by air pollution. In one double-blind study, 46 Dutch bicyclists were randomly assigned to receive a placebo or 100 mg of vitamin E and 500 mg of vitamin C daily for 15 weeks. Lung function was measured before and after each training session on 380 different occasions, and ambient ozone concentrations were measured during each training session. After analysis, researchers concluded that bicyclists with the vitamins C and E blunted the adverse effects of ozone on measures of lung function. In another double-blind study, 17 adults (18 to 39 years old) were randomly assigned to receive either 400 IU per day of vitamin E and 500 mg per day of vitamin C or a placebo for five weeks. Tests showing improved measures of lung function led researchers to conclude that supplementation with vitamins C and E inhibited the decline in pulmonary function induced in asthmatics by exposure to air pollutants. Also using a double-blind design, another study of 158 children with asthma living in Mexico City were randomly assigned to receive, a daily supplement containing 50 mg of vitamin E and 250 mg of vitamin C or a placebo. Tests results suggested that supplementing with vitamins C and E may reduce the adverse effect of ozone exposure on lung function of children with moderate to severe asthma.
