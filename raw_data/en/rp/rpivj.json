Outlaw Mobile Convention Center Keynote Speaker: John Smoltz, Baseball Hall of Fame Join us for the 12th Annual Hope for Healing Our annual Hope for Healing is one of the ways we invite you to partner with us to provide restorative, life-saving healing for the more than 100,000 people in our region, and to share the hope of Jesus. The story of Victory began with Founders, Dr. Robert and Tami Lightfoot serving thousands of patients during an overseas medical mission trip and has transitioned to serving and caring for over 35,000 patients who are uninsured over the last two decades. The decision to delay or forgo healthcare for many usually results in a negative outcome physically and financially, which also impacts their emotional and spiritual health. Currently, there are 100,000 adults from Mobile and Baldwin County that represent family, friends, co-workers, and our community who rely on a hospital for their primary care when their health becomes a crisis. God has orchestrated Victory for 21 years and the next 20 years will be the continuation of His faithfulness as we expand to comprehensively care for the complete needs of our community. The evening includes dinner and inspirational testimonies from the founding to present-day partnerships who are furthering the impact in the lives of our patients. 5:00 P.M. - VIP Reception with Keynote Speaker, John Smoltz 5:30 P.M. - Main Event Doors Open 6:00 P.M. - Dinner & Program Sponsorship Opportunities Make a direct impact on the lives of our uninsured neighbors by providing transformational healing and hope.
