No fillers, preservatives, or artificial flavors, ever. That's pretty powerful stuff. FOR YOU Our Clean Lean Protein is regularly tested for safe microbial activity, heavy metals, pesticides, and common allergens. Rest assured you are in safe hands. AND THE PLANET Sustainable from farm to jar, these high-quality, environmentally friendly pods of fuel are grown cleanly, processed consciously, and delivered to you in 100% recyclable tubs. Go ahead, read the fine print Good things come in small packages. Meet our European golden peas, the foundation of Clean Lean Protein\u2014a simple product that works with nature, not against it. WATER-BASED PROCESSING The isolation process, which is how we extract the protein from the peas, is entirely water-based and free from harmful chemicals. HYPOALLERGENIC Nuzest's pea protein isolate, and Clean Lean Protein, are free from all major allergens. We meet the most stringent gluten-free requirements in the world. Enjoy your protein with peace of mind. EASY TO DIGEST Protein supplements get a bad rap for causing bloating, but our plant-based protein is free from gums, fillers, and masking agents\u2014the common culprits behind GI discomfort. Bonus: our isolation process removes nearly all anti-nutritional elements that interfere with digestion, including 100% of the lectins. SWEET BY NATURE Get the benefits without the bitterness. We use Thaumatin, an extract from the West African Katemfe fruit, to add an all-natural sweetness to our protein. "}
