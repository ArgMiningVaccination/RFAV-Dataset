The College, founded and operated by The Sisters of the Third Order of Saint Francis, is enriched by the heritage of the Sisters who have a mission of caring and commitment to quality health care. The College provides nursing education programs at the undergraduate and the graduate levels. The upper div ision baccalaureate program prepares the student for the practice of professional nursing. This program builds on and incorporates theories, concepts, and principles from behavioral, natural, and social sciences. The graduate program builds on the prior nu rsing knowledge and experiences to prepare the nurse for the advanced roles in nursing. The College serves the community by educating competent entry level and advanced practitioners in a tradition of excellence in nursing, who deliver caring, comprehensiv e, and complex care responsive to the changing needs of society in a dynamic healthcare environment. The faculty and students of the College participate in both scholarly and service activities that contribute to knowledge development related to education, nursing, and healthcare. VISION While representing a standard of excellence, Saint Francis Medical Center College of Nursing will obtain local, regional, and national recognition by providing the highest quality undergraduate and graduate nursing education programs, as well as the best practicum experiences. This will in turn prepare competent, caring nurses who deliver the highest quality care, education, and leadership. PHILOSOPHY The philosophy of Saint Francis Medical Center College of Nursing, developed by the faculty, is congruent with the Corporate Philosophy and Corporate Mission Statement of the Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis. It is in accord with Catholic philosophy and follows the ideals of St. Francis of Assisi who had a great love f or God and humankind, especially the sick and the poor. Philosophy of Nursing We believe each person is created by God with a mortal body and an immortal soul whose ultimate aim is eternal salvation. We believe each person, born with intellect and free wi ll, has personal dignity and natural rights with associated responsibilities to God, humankind, and society. The individual, as a member of society, is an adaptive being who is constantly interacting with the environment while striving toward self -actualiz ation throughout the life cycle. We believe society is a multicultural system composed of interdependent individuals, families, groups and communities. Society has the responsibility to provide a health care system, which is responsive to changing knowledg e, technology, and human resources, and is accessible to its members. The faculty believes health is a dynamic state in which the individual adapts to one's internal and external environments so that there is a state of physical, emotional, intellectual, social and spiritual well -being. We believe that health encompasses both wellness and illness. Inherent in the individual's rights is the right to attain optimal health and the right to health care. We believe professional nursing is an art and an applie d science which builds on the behavioral, natural, and social sciences. Nursing utilizes selected concepts, theories, principles, and research in the implementation of the nursing process. The nurse, through application of the nursing process, assists the patient in achieving optimal health status by facilitating adaptation within the individual's social system. As the health care system changes, the professional nurse must be prepared to assume a variety of emerging roles. The goals of nursing are the prom otion and maintenance of health, the care and rehabilitation of the sick and the injured, and the support 3 of the dying. To achieve the goals of nursing, the professional nurse collaborates with the patient, family, and members of the interprofessional heal th care team in planning and providing care, and in promoting health of the individual, the family, and the community. We believe caring is an essential element of both the art and science of nursing. Caring permeates all areas of nursing practice and facilitates the achievement of nursing goals. Caring is a helping relationship which is influenced by cultural and spiritual values and which promotes growth and self -actualization of the patient and the nurse. Philosophy of Nursing Education The faculty believes that the purpose of nursing education is to promote a student centered learning environment that develops critical thinking, skills of inquiry, creative thinking and problem solving in the process of obtaining knowledge. The faculty believes that learning, a life-long process, occurs when the individual is an active participant. Learning is both an independent and interdependent process. We believe that students learn through cyclical processes in which theory and practice reinforce one another. T he faculty accepts responsibility as educators to foster a student centered learning environment which maximizes each individual's unique potential. The learner in a student centered learning environment draws from previous experiences to make meaning of current situations. We believe that the student is a unique individual who has intrinsic worth, is deserving of respect, and is capable of making informed decisions regarding learning. The faculty recognizes that the learner comes from a sociocultural background with diverse life experiences and varied attitudes and values. The faculty believes that the student is at the center of the curriculum and is an active participant in learning and \"coming to know\". The faculty acts as a guide and facilitator in the learning process and is responsible for the development, implementation, and evaluation of the learning experience. Planned learning activities advance intellectual inquiry, self -reflection, critical thinking, effective communication, and self -directed, independent learning. We believe that the goal of the academic programs is to facilitate deep learning which involves the critical analysis of new ideas, linking them to already known theories, concepts and principles. This type of learning leads to unde rstanding and long- term retention of concepts so that they may be used as the basis for problem solving in unfamiliar contexts. Deep learning promotes understanding and application for life. Baccalaureate and Graduate Education The faculty believes that the baccalaureate nursing education builds upon and incorporates the natural and social sciences and the liberal arts. This broad foundation provides the understanding of humankind and society necessary for the learner to begin the implementation of the nursing process. We believe professional nursing education integrates theories, principles, and knowledge from the general studies with nursing theories, concepts, and experiences. Baccalaureate nursing education prepares the graduate for the practice of professional nursing as a generalist who is able to function independently and interdependently with individuals, families and groups in a variety of health care settings. Graduate nursing education prepares the individual for advanced nursing practice. The g raduate is prepared to function autonomously in a variety of roles and settings. Students integrate theory, research, and practice for the improvement of patient care and the advancement of nursing practice and the profession. We believe the Judeo -Christian tenets underlying the nursing education at Saint Francis Medical Center College of Nursing promote values essential for the personal and professional philosophy of God and humankind. These values, inculcated throughout the curricula, guide the learner to evolve into an ethical and accountable professional nurse. 4 STATEMENT OF VALUES The philosophy of Saint Francis Medical Center College of Nursing, developed by the faculty, is congruent with the Corporate Philosophy and Corporate Mission Statement of T he Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis. It is in accord with Catholic philosophy and flows from the ideals of St. Francis of Assisi who had a great love for God and humankind, especially the sick and the poor. The following values flow from this phi losophy and permeate all aspects of the College. The purposes of the College of Nursing Value Statements are to: support the mission and philosophy, provide direction for the day -to-day activities and decisions, specify how individuals should behave, and provide meaning to each person's work. The Values are: I. Personal & Professional Development - Learning - is a lifelong, interactive process in which critical thinking and intellectual inquiry skills are developed and a change of behavior, attitude or t hought patterns occur. Learners are valued as unique individuals, with diverse life experiences and varied attitudes and values, who are active participants in the process. Caring - develops helping relationships influenced by cultural and spiritual values and promotes the growth and self -actualization of the patient, nurse, student, and employee. The College values open and honest communication, which fosters trusting relationships among ourselves and those we serve. Leadership - is facilitating action by de veloping people to achieve and maintain change Yoder -Wise and Kowalski, 2006). Leadership embraces the importance of responsibility, accountability, and commitment. It is the ability to have a vision for the College, enable and empower others to attain the vision through using and developing trusting relationships. Personal worth & dignity - recognizes the unique value of each person as an individual, regardless of race, color, age, gender, ethnic background, or religion. Born with intellect and free will, t he individual is a member of society and an adaptive being who is constantly interacting with the environment while striving toward self -actualization throughout the life cycle. II. Service Integrity - believes in Judeo -Christian tenets, which permeate t he curriculum and promote the ethical values of human dignity, justice, service, and respect for life. These values provide a foundation for the institution in its practices and relationships and are essential in the College's commitment to high standards of institutional and individual integrity. Responsibility - is the obligation to accomplish a task or assignment (Wise and Kolwaski, 2006). Accepting responsibility for one's work or life provides a sense of inner control, which leads to owning responsible for what is happening in one's life (Barker, Sullivan and Emery, 2006). Accountability - is defined as the act of accepting ownership for one's responsibilities and the results or the lack of results, without blame and rationalizations. Accountability focus es on outcomes (Wise and Kolwaski, 2006). Accountability is a personal choice to demonstrate ownership necessary for achieving the desired, clearly identified outcomes and results. We believe that each employee will ask what else I can do to achieve, advan ce, grow, or enhance the achievement of the outcomes of the College and their personal life (O'Grady & Malloch, 2003). The College accepts responsibility and holds each other accountable for carrying out the Mission of the College through quality nursing education, qualified faculty, and sufficient 5 support for excellence in student learning outcomes. The College educates students about valuing and commitment to personal and professional accountability. III. Quality -includes excellence. We believe in achi eving the best results possible not just doing a job. Excellence- is the commitment to quality nursing education programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels.

COLLEGE GOALS Saint Francis Medical Center Col lege of Nursing offers educational opportunities which: Prepare the graduate to practice professional nursing in a variety of roles and health care settings. Provide the essential foundation for graduate study in nursing. Foster the commitment to personal and professional growth and accountability. ORGANIZING FRAMEWORK The organizing framework incorporates theories, concepts, and principles from behavioral, natural, and social sciences. This framework is developed from the four major concepts of the nursing metaparadigm (person, health, nursing, and environment) as well as the concepts of society and student centered learning. Each of the major concepts has a number of subconcepts. Person is conceptualized as an individual, a member of society, and an adaptive being that is constantly interacting with the environment while striving toward self -actualization throughout the life cycle. A person is a holistic being created by God with responsibilities to God, humankind, and society. All persons have both bas ic and higher level needs whereas each individual has a unique combination of physical, emotional, social, intellectual, and spiritual needs which may vary in priority. The term \"person\" refers not only to patients and families, but also to students. Health is a state of being, which is relative and dynamic; has physical, emotional, social, cultural, and spiritual dimensions; and encompasses wellness and illness. Wellness is a state in which all aspects of a person's functioning are balanced, purposeful, and directed toward attaining one's optimal health. Health promotion is a major focus of professional nursing practice. Illness is an abnormal process in which any aspect of a person's functioning is diminished or impaired as compared with one's previous c ondition. Nursing , an art and an applied science, is a practice discipline characterized by caring. The art of nursing is demonstrated in the development of a caring relationship through the application of communication skills and teaching/learning princ iples in interactions which are influenced by cultural and spiritual values and which promote the growth and self -actualization of 6 the patient and/or nurse. The goals of nursing, to promote and maintain health, rehabilitate and restore the sick and injured , and support the critically ill and/or dying, are achieved through the nursing process. This analytical approach of assessing, diagnosing, planning, implementing, and evaluating pervades all areas of nursing. Nursing, as an applied science based on theory , requires critical thinking and intellectual inquiry and is expanded by nursing research which provides the empirical foundation for evidence -based practice. Exposure to nursing theory enhances the nursing process. Professional nursing is actualized through the roles of caregiver, educator, leader, manager, advocate, and researcher. The graduate has expanded roles to include management, leadership, caregiver, researcher and educator. These expanded roles include responsibilities in the management of outcom es, risks, services, and resources; case management; program development and evaluation; and interprofessional team management. The graduate prepared nurse uses advanced knowledge and critical thinking skills to respond to the changing health care environm ent. Environment is conceptualized as a dynamic milieu of internal and external stimuli, circumstances, and influences which surround and affect persons. By a process of interaction and adaptation, a varying degree of balance between the internal and ext ernal environment is maintained. The adaptive response is dependent upon the individual's rational attributes, genetic endowment, growth and development, learning emanating from past experiences, perceptions of the present, and speculations on the future. In the selection of student learning experiences, situations are chosen for the promotion and maintenance of patient health; for the rehabilitation and restoration of the sick and injured; and for the support of those who are in crisis or dying. Graduate s tudent learning opportunities focus on assessing the effectiveness of interprofessional collaboration, identifying factors (e.g., culture, finances, regulatory requirements, external demands, and other contextual variables in the environment of care) that influence outcomes, identifying significant organizational relationships that are facilitators or barriers to any proposed change, and identifying differences created by organizational culture that occur between and among departments, teams, and/or groups within an organization that can affect how a change is implemented. Society encompasses the individual, family, population groups, and community. Society is defined as a multicultural system composed of interdependent individuals, families, groups, and communities. Communities may be national, international, or broad groupings of people having common traditions, institutions, and collective activities and interests. Persistent and growing underserved, rural, and vulnerable populations are a major focus of contemporary professional nursing. Numerous societal demands require creative interventions, alternative settings and new partnerships and coalitions to maximize health care delivery and decrease health disparities. Student centered learning places th e responsibility for learning on the student who works cooperatively with peers and faculty to establish mutual learning goals. The premise of student centered learning is that students will have greater motivation to learn if they perceive that they have a vested interest in their own learning. Instead of the teacher being the sole, infallible source of information, the teacher shares control of the learning environment. Students are encouraged to explore, experiment, and discover on their own and in coope ration with peers. An important aspect of student centered learning is the practice of experiential learning. Such intellectual exercise facilitates the student's ability to make connections in such a way that the student is able to successfully apply prev iously learned concepts to new and unfamiliar situations. The primary concepts for the undergraduate curriculum progress from the promotion and maintenance of health to support in crisis and dying; and environment. All other concepts and subconcepts are pervasive, including quality and safety which are integral to the programs. 7 In the graduate curriculum, the pervasive concepts are theory, role development, caring/communication, leadership, critical thinking, therapeutic nursing interventions, research, environment, culture and ethics. Additional skill sets are incorporated into nursing courses which include health care policy, finance, current practice of nursing, current trends in health care, current trends in education, community concepts, health ca re delivery, values and accountability. Subconcepts, as identified by the college, further define and expand the major concepts of person, health, nursing, environment, society, and student centered learning as follows: PERSON: A person is an individual created by God with a mortal body and an immortal soul whose ultimate aim is eternal salvation. An individual has personal dignity and natural rights with associated responsibilities to God, self, and others. A person is a member of society who has a dependent role, an interdependent role, and an independent role in the family, group, or community in which the person functions. A person is an adaptive being who is constantly responding to alterations in the environment to achieve an integration of physical, emotional, intellectual, social, cultural and spiritual health. All persons have needs , which are perceived and/or unperceived physical, emotional, intellectual, social, and spiritual requirements. As persons pass through developmental stages of life stri ving toward self -actualization, their need progresses from the basic to higher levels. HEALTH: Wellness is a state in which all aspects of a person's functioning are balanced, purposeful, and directed toward attaining one's full potential. Illness is an abnormal process in which any aspect of a person's functioning is diminished or impaired as compared with one's previous condition. Dimensions of health are the physical, emotional, intellectual, social, cultural, and spiritual aspects of a person. Healt h promotion includes encouraging healthy lifestyles, creating supportive environments for health, strengthening community action, reorienting health services to place primary focus on promoting health and preventing disease, and building healthy public pol icy (Turner as cited in Pender, 20) NURSING: The nursing process is a systematic method of organizing the delivery of evidence -based nursing care. Components of the process are: assessing health status and health potential, formulating nursing diagnoses , planning individualized interventions, implementing planned care, and evaluating the patient's response. Graduate nursing education prepares the nurse to function autonomously in a variety of roles, and integrates theory, research, and practice for the i mprovement of patient care and the advancement of the nursing profession. The art of nursing is the skill manifested in the competent, caring management of patient care. Caring is the helping relationship which is influenced by spiritual and cultural value s and which promotes the growth and self -actualization of the patient and/or nurse. The concept of caring encompasses the processes of interaction, communication, and teaching/learning. 8 Nursing is an applied science, which integrates theory, research and p ractice to provide an empirical foundation for best practices. The goals of nursing are the promotion and maintenance of health, the restoration and rehabilitation of the sick and injured, and the support of the critically ill and /or dying. The professio nal nurse functions in the interrelated roles of care giver, educator, leader, advocate, facilitator, researcher, and manager. The graduate functions with advanced expertise in the expanded roles of clinician, which includes caregiver, manager, and leader ; and educator, which includes teacher, scholar and collaborator. The professional nurse is accountable and liable for her/his actions, willing to be judged against performance expectations, willing to live with the results of one's actions and be able to determine where those results were successful and where they need change or modification. ENVIRONMENT: The internal environment consists of the set of factors inside a person that may influence one's health, e.g. genetic factors, physiological processes, psychological variables, intellectual and spiritual dimensions. The external environment consists of the set of factors outside and distinct from a person that may influence one's health, e.g. physical, social, cultural, and economic variables. Within the global healthcare environment, the graduate nurse will incorporate creative problem solving to discover innovative alternative solutions to system problems, to develop innovative solutions that can be generalized across differing population groups and/or specialties, and to lead nursing and interprofessional groups in implementing innovative patient care programs that address patient care issues across the full continuum of care, different population groups, and/or different specialties. SOCIETY: An individual is a member of society who has a role in a family, group, and community. A family is the basic unit of society; two or more people living together with shared emotional and economic involvement; a group of people who interact with care and concern for each other. A population group is a number of persons considered together because of common interests or similarities. A community is an interacting population, people with common interest living in a particular area; people with common history or soci al, economic, and political interests. A global community describes all populations worldwide who interact with one another and share information and resources. Common concerns of the global community include vulnerability and health disparity. STUDENT CE NTERED LEARNING: The student is an active participant in the learning process. The student assumes responsibility for his/her own learning. The student and teacher form a partnership for the achievement of learning outcomes. The student works collaboratively with peers, faculty, and health care staff to master concepts as outlined by the curriculum. The student, through the process of experiential learning , is able to appropriately employ previously learned information when faced with new situations. The c urriculum emphasizes experiential learning which affords students the opportunity to integrate abstract, conceptual knowledge into concrete applications, leading to broader, more 9 enduring learning outcomes. Dewey (1916) describes the process of making connections through experience as follows: To \"learn from experience\" is to make a backward and forward connection between what we do to things and what we suffer or enjoy from things in consequence (p. 140). Experience is crucial to the process of learning because it brings people together and encourages participation. This is abundantly evident in the realm of nursing education due to the essential component of clinical experience. The real -world \"hands -on\" experiences in the clinical setting which allow the student to work with actual patients, as well as simulated experiences in the clinical laboratory, are invaluable to the student's development as a competent practitioner. With respect to curriculum development at the College of Nursing, for an experi ence to be a valuable learning process the student must have the opportunity for, and be guided towards \"reflective thought\" so that the relevance of the experience can be assessed and the experience can be placed into context. According to Dewey ( [1910] , 1991) it is the teacher's duty to foster intellectual curiosity by keeping alive, the sacred spark of wonder and to fan the flame that already glows...[and to] protect the spirit of inquiry, to keep it from becoming blas\u00e9 ...wooden from routine, fossilized t hrough dogmatic instruction, or dissipated by random exercise upon trivial things (p. 34). The concept of \"reflective thought\" enables the student to refuse to accept something at face value so that he/she may suspend judgment in order to allow for furthe r inquiry. The challenge of reflective thought is to develop the ability to suspend conclusions and master the ability to search for further evidence. It is essential to maintain a state of doubt while conducting systematic and protracted inquiry (Dewey [1910], 1991). \"Deep learning\" in a concept -based curriculum facilitates the learners' ability to: Search for meaning; Focus on the central concepts needed to solve a problem; Interact actively with peers, faculty, and member of the healthcare team; Identif y connections between different modules of study; Relate new and previous knowledge; Link course content to real life; Develop an intrinsic curiosity in the subject; Have time to pursue interests, through good time management; Have a positive educational experience that promotes confidence in the ability to understand and succeed. We believe that a concept -based curriculum emphasizes the \"inquiry\" model of learning and moves students away from the \"memorization\" model, which does not result in deep learning . 10 The curriculum of the College is designed to meet or exceed contemporary standards of higher education by: Creating collaborative opportunities with local, regional, national and international communities; Promoting learning as a lifelong process; Integrating theory and practice which fosters the ability of students to comprehend and apply fundamental concepts: Fostering the students' ability to relate abstract ideas to the concrete practical realities of life (Kolb, 1984) Addressing the unique c oncerns of a growing segment of the student population - older students who \"demand that the relevance and application of ideas be demonstrated and tested against their own accumulated experience and wisdom\". (Kolb, 1984) Facilitating the development of time-management and teamwork skills in response to societal and workplace expectations; Developing partnerships with students, faculty, and employers to provide graduates with the knowledge, skills and experience they need to lead successful professional lives.

BACCALAUREATE CURRICULUM The curriculum for the Bachelor of Science in Nursing Degree offered by the College of Nursing consists of a total of 124 semester hours of course work. These hours are divided as follows: BSN Curriculum Pre-Nursing Semester Hours Nursing Major Semester Hours Total Semester Hours Starting prior to Fall 2014 term 62 62 124 Starting Fall 2014 term and later 59 65 124 The curriculum was designed by the faculty so that each course contributes to the overall program. The curriculum is based upon the mission and philosophy of the College . Courses required in the pre -nursing sequence prepare the student for the study of the nu rsing major. The organizing framework gives direction to the sequencing of courses in the nursing major and explains the major concepts developed in the courses. Successful completion of the curriculum enables the graduate to meet the curriculum o utcomes . PRE -NURSING The required pre -nursing sequence is composed of : Pre-nursing Requirements: Required Credit Hours: Anatomy and Physiology 8 Microbiology 3 to 4 Chemistry 4 Nutrition 2 to 3 Social and Behavioral Sciences 15 Communication Skills 9 Human ities and Fine Arts 9 Mathematics 6 Elective(s) 1 to 3 Totals 59 to 62 13 The requirements of the pre -nursing curriculum incorporate both the General Education Core Curriculum adopted by the Illinois Board of Higher Education (IBHE) and the specific cour ses required to support the nursing major. The required pre -nursing courses enhance the student's ability to think logically, reason, formulate ideas, and communicate effectively. They also enhance the student's natural abilities, stimulate creativity, and encourage a willingness to explore new ideas. Humanities and fine arts contribute to the art of nursing which is demonstrated in sensitivity to the human condition, the appreciation of individuality, and the development of creativity. The study of philos ophy contributes to the student's understanding of self and the beliefs and values of others. It gives the student the opportunity to explore value systems and develop critical thinking. Philosophical concepts brought to the upper division courses are the foundation for understanding values, concepts, and standards underlying nursing practice. These concepts provide a basic understanding especially for the course, Ethics and Health Care Implications. They provide the basis for decision -making based on Jude o-Christian tenets in the ethical dilemmas in nursing practice discussed throughout the various courses in the nursing major. Written and oral communication and language skills are essential to the development of the individual as both a contributing member of society and a practicing professional within the health care system. Communication skills are used in: the implementation of the nursing process; the development of therapeutic nurse- client relationships; the transfer of knowledge; the application of teaching -learning principles in client education; the application of management skills such as decision -making, conflict management, and motivational strategies; the utilization of research; and the process of self -evaluation. The study of mathematics an d statistics enables the student to develop skills which are necessary for intellectual inquiry, critical analysis, and synthesis of data. These studies are used by the professional nurse to monitor client status, interpret data, understand the research pr ocess and findings, and implement therapeutic nursing interventions. Computer literacy is required in response to expanded technology in both health care and society for the individual's personal, educational, and professional endeavors. Students use micro computers for computer assisted instruction, writing papers, testing with computerized client simulations, and accessing computerized databases in the library. The required social and behavioral sciences introduce the students to the study of human behavi or and include topics such as personality, emotions, intelligence, growth and development through the lifespan, cultures, groups, roles, and society. These courses provide the basis for understanding clients as persons, members of families, communities, and society. Concepts and principles from the social and behavioral sciences are integral to the study of nursing, health, person, society, and environment. The understanding of individuals and their interactions in society enables students to begin to dev elop the art of caring which is essential to the practice of professional nursing. The study of the physical and life sciences provides an understanding of the physical aspects of persons, their environment, and their adaptation to internal and external e nvironments. The role of nutrients and dietary requirements of individuals throughout the life cycle is studied as part of the course work in this category. Knowledge acquired in the physical and life sciences provides the foundation for the study of healt h-related alterations and the related nursing care. NURSING Active learning is an integral part of nursing education and helps to promote critical thinking. Students are required to take a learning strategies course their first semester at the College that will build upon their individual learning style. The nursing courses in the first semester of the junior year introduce the interrelated concepts of nursing, person, health, society, and environment. Nursing, caring, communication skills and teaching -learning principles are introduced as the basis for effective implementation of the nursing process throughout the curriculum. Students discuss cultural and spiritual beliefs and practices that foster the view of each 14 individual as a holistic being. Focusing on the person as a member of society, the student assesses the individual's physical, emotional, social, cultural, intellectual, and spiritual needs. The student is introduced to professional standards and nursing theory models as it relates to practice. The student studies concepts of nursing care related to the promotion and maintenance of client health and begins to use the nursing process in the clinical setting in predictable situations. Psychomotor skills basic to the delivery of nursing care and the use of the nursing process are developed. The student recognizes methods of problem solving which requires intellectual inquiry and critical thinking. The roles and characteristics of the professional nurse, with emphasis on the roles of care giver and ed ucator, are discussed. Drug classifications with related actions, effects, and interactions are studied as well as the roles and responsibilities of the professional nurse in drug therapy. Students apply knowledge of physiological needs to the study of he alth-related alterations. Students clarify their own values, begin to assume the characteristics of a professional nurse, and accept responsibility for learning by meeting the course objectives. In the nursing courses in the second semester of the junior year and the first semester of the senior year, students focus on the body of nursing knowledge necessary for the use of the nursing process with clients in states of wellness or illness to facilitate the promotion, maintenance, restoration, or rehabilitat ion of health. The student continues to promote and maintain health, synthesizing previous learning with current courses. The student cares for: families across the lifespan, focusing on women's health, mental health, geriatrics, and children and adults in acute care settings. Nurse -client interactions occur primarily in predictable situations; however, the student recognizes the potential for change and initiates immediate nursing actions in unpredictable situations. The student assists the client in meet ing physical, emotional, social, cultural, intellectual, and spiritual needs with specific course emphasis on higher level needs. Integrated throughout these semesters are the nursing responsibilities associated with therapeutic interventions. The nursing process is used to facilitate client's adaptation to achieve optimal health. Caring relationships are developed with clients using communication skills and principles of teaching/learning. The student interacts with members of the health team in a variety of health settings including the acute care setting and the community. The student develops an understanding of the research process and uses research findings in exploring nursing care alternatives and in formulating the rationale for nursing diagnoses a nd interventions. The professional nursing roles actualized by the student in these semesters are mainly those of care giver, facilitator, and educator. Interactions with families and groups provide opportunities for the student to develop leadership skill s. Ethical decision- making emphasizing the Judeo- Christian tenets and ethical issues related to health care are studied. The student integrates ethical, legal and accepted standards of professional nursing practice with own values. Critical analysis and in tellectual inquiry are fostered throughout the courses. The student participates in the selection of learning experiences to achieve course objectives. In the nursing courses in the second semester of the senior year, the student implements the nursing pr ocess with individuals, families or groups in the community and acute care settings . The student cares for clients with complex health problems in primarily unpredictable situations. Previous learning is synthesized with concepts of management in the nursi ng care of clients with complex problems. Throughout this semester, the student has increased opportunities to use critical analysis and intellectual inquiry. Caring is expressed in interactions with patients, families , peers, and the health care team. The student selects and uses appropriate services to assist clients' adaptation within their environment. Leadership skills and principles of management are demonstrated in the delivery of health care and in collaboration with health care team members. The st udent evaluates and applies research findings to nursing practice. The professional roles assumed in this semester are care giver, advocate, educator, facilitator, leader, manager, and researcher. Professional issues, perspectives, and nursing theories/mod els are studied in relation to their impact on nursing as a profession, the individual, and society. The commitment to professional growth and continued learning fostered throughout the curriculum is further enhanced by the student's participation in the s election and design of learning experiences, particularly in the independent study and elective courses. 15 REGISTERED NURSE TO BACCALAUREATE DEGREE (RN - BSN) The College of Nursing offers registered nurses the opportunity for advanced placement in the bac calaureate nursing program. The educational plan for the registered nurse shares the purposes and objectives of the generic nursing program.

Adapted from the Sout hern Council on Collegiate Education in Nursing Guidelines w ith minor additions or changes Revised A&P 1/16/2015, College Senate 5/21/2015 Procedure Notifying College of Disability and Request for Accommodations 1. Students should notify the Dean of the Undergraduate Program of disabilities for which they are asking for reasonable accommodations. 2. Students should submit accep table documentation (See Documentation Guidelines) to the Dean at least two weeks prior to the start of the semester in which accommodations are being requested. 3. The Dean will review the documentation and if necessary talk with the students regarding the request. The Dean reserves the right to determine which accommodation(s) are reasonable. 4. The Dean will notify the student in writing of accommodations that are being granted for the disability specified in the documentation. 5. Omission of required i nformation or false or misleading information provided by the student on the request for accommodations, disabilities documentation, or in any communication with the College may result in disciplinary action or dismissal according to the Professional Stand ards section in the Student Handbook . Notifying Faculty of Accommodations 1. Upon receipt of the notification letter from the Dean, the student should contact the Dean to obtain the Instructor Notification Forms for each course. It is the responsibility of the student to inform course instructors of needed and approved accommodations. 2. Students are to meet with each course instructor and provide copies of the Instructor Notification Form to the instructor during the first two weeks of the semester. 3. Each semester that the student is enrolled, the student should contact the Dean of the Undergraduate Program to obtain Instructor Notification Forms for courses during the semester. 31 Saint Francis Medical Center College of Nursing Peoria, Illinois Instructor Notification Form has provided the College of Nursing with appropriate documentation for requested accommodations based on identified disabilities. The above named student has been granted the following reasonable accommodations for the se mester: Sue Brown, RN, PhD Date Dean , Undergraduate Program 32 Access Services Student and College Responsibilities College Responsibilities Saint Francis Medical Center College of Nursing is committed to making its pro grams accessible to all students. Through the Offices of the Dean of the Undergraduate Program, the College will work with students, staff and faculty to provide timely, equitable access to all aspects of the programs offered. Additional assistance is avai lable to students through the offices of the Academic Development Center, Health Nurse, and Counselor. Services will include, but are not limited to intake and review of disability documentation from students, working with students to make determinations f or reasonable accommodations, coordinating services and accommodations and providing direct accommodations as needed. Student Responsibilities It is the responsibility of the student with a disability who is seeking accommodations to: Inform the College of Nursing of any disability in which the student is requesting reasonable accommodations. This is done through scheduling an appointment with the Dean of the Undergraduate Program on campus and submitting the required supporting documentation (See Docume ntation Guidelines) . Provide documentation that shows the current impact the disability has upon performance in classes. Students need to be knowledgeable about their disability so that they can discuss the disability and reasonable accommodation requests with the Dean. Request specific accommodations in a timely manner each semester for each class in which the student is enrolled and is requesting accommodations. The student needs to meet with each course instructor individually and discuss accommodations for each class, each semester. The Dean of the Undergraduate Program will provide students with Instructor Notification Form s for each class in which accommodations are granted to assist the student in this notification process. Obtain the Instructor N otification Form from the Dean's Office and to notify the instructor the first week of the semester so that the instructor can assist the student with the needed accommodations. The faculty member will work with the Dean to set up the testing accommodation s. Asking for testing accommodations one day prior to an exam is not timely by the student. Students should verify testing arrangements with the faculty at least two days before the test is to be taken. Students should contact the Dean of the Underg raduat e Program in room 606 for questions or assistance. The phone number is 309- 655-2206. Confidentiality All documentation and information submitted to the Dean of the Undergraduate Program will be kept in a file in the Dean's office that is separate from th e student's academic, financial, and other records at the College. After the student has delivered the required documentation to the Dean, the documentation becomes the property of Saint Francis Medical Center College of Nursing. Documentation will not be returned to the student. If a student needs a copy of the documentation once it has been submitted to the College, the student will need to obtain the documentation from the originating source. 33 Documentation will be kept on file for up to three years afte r the student has taken courses. Inactivity for six consecutive semesters may cause the student's file to be purged, in which case the student would need to reapply, including resubmission of documentation. Documentation Students must submit comprehensiv e documentation of their disability consisting of a diagnostic statement from a qualified profession al in the appropriate discipline. Documentation should address how the disability currently impacts the student's access to the College physically or academ ically. All documentation needs to be signed by the professional conducting the evaluation. Individualized Education Plans (IEPs), section 504 plans and Summary of Performances (SOPs) are not accepted as sole documentation of a student's disability. Any of these forms may be submitted in conjunction with other forms of documentation in order to assist in obtaining a complete profile of the student and student's needs. Students may bring a copy of any of the above along with other documentation of their di sability to assist the student in discussing the disability with the Dean of the Undergraduate Program. Students should refer to the Documentation Guidelines for acceptable documentation. A diagnostic report may include specific recommendations for accomm odations. These recommendations will be reviewed by the Dean to determine if the accommodation recommended is reasonable for the course. Any accommodations that provide the student with information or assistance that would compromise the integrity of the t est results or course outcomes are generally not considered reasonable. A prior history of an accommodation, without the demonstration of a current need, does not in and of itself insure the accommodation will be granted by the College. Each accommodation recommended by a qualified evaluator should include a rationale and be supported with specific test results or clinical observations. Documentation Guidelines Learning Disabilities The most recent complete diagnostic evaluation from a qualified professi onal, generally a clinical psychologist, should be submitted. A partial psychological evaluation, consisting of select pages from a full report will be considered incomplete and cannot be accepted. The specific diagnosis must be included in the evaluation. Names of tests administered and the actual test scores must be included in the evaluation along with a discussion of the significance of the scores. How the disability impacts learning, recommendations for specific learning strategies, academic support services, and prescribed medications(s), a s well as any other treatments, should all be included in the psychological report. Reports must be current and should be based on adult norms. Common tests used to diagnosis learning disabilities include the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and Wechsler Individual Achievement Test. A Psychological evaluation from a grade school would not be an acceptable form of documentation for an adult student at the College. The College has made arrangements with a local organiz ation that will perform a comprehensive learning disability assessment. Contact the Dean of the Undergraduate Program for more information. Cost for the assessment is the responsibility of the student. Attention Deficit Disorder The most recent psych ological evaluation or complete physician's report is required. A note from a student's physician or primary healthcare provider stating the student has Attention Deficit Disorder and needs testing accommodation will not suffice as complete documentation. How the disability impacts learning, recommendations for specific learning strategies, academic support services, and prescribed medications(s), as well as any other treatments should all be included in the psychological report. Cost for the assessment is the responsibility of the student. 34 Health Impairments, Physical Disability or Orthopedic Impairments The College of Nursing Core Performance Standards identifies the skills and performance standards that are considered essential requirements for the Coll ege of Nursing program. Students who have health, physical or orthopedic impairments or disabilities that impact their ability to meet these requirements need to meet with the Dean of the Undergraduate Program. Students should provide an appropriate report discussing the impact of the disability upon access and ability to meet to perform the standards outline in the College of Nursing Core Performance Standards. Medical, occupational or physical therapy reports discussing the impact of the disability on access are examples of appropriate documentation. Cost for the assessment is the responsibility of the student. Approved College Senate 5/7/2010 ACADEMIC ADVISEMENT/PL AN OF STUDY Each student will be assigned an academic advisor. Registration for the first semester will occur after the student has met with the advisor to discuss personal and educational goals and to develop a plan of study approved by the advisor. The student is responsible for scheduling this meeting. The student is also responsible for sche duling a meeting with the advisor prior to registering each subsequent semester to review the plan of study and revise it as needed. Registration for courses cannot occur until the student and advisor review the plan of study. The Plan of Study form for undergraduate students can be found in Appendix A of the Student Handbook. Undergraduate Student Classification : Students who have completed all of the required pre - nursing courses and are enrolled in the College pursuing a deg ree may be either part -time or full -time. Students carrying twelve or more semester hours are considered full -time. A student may enroll in a maximum of ten semester hours as a student - at-large. Graduate Student Classification: Unconditional acceptance is given to all applicants who meet all the admission criteria and are approved by the Graduate Committee. Conditional acceptance is given to applicants who do not meet all the admission criteria such as applicants with less than a 2.8 GPA (and greater than a 2.5) or those needing to complete the graduate statistics course with a minimum grade of \"B\" or better. At the time of admission, the Graduate Committee may specify other conditions for the applicant that would need to be fulfilled in order to progress in the program. To have conditional acceptance status removed for the person with less than a 2.8 GPA, the student must complete twelve semester hours of course work with a minimum grade of \"B\" in each course. Students must complete the statistics prerequi site course within the first 9 credit hours in the Graduate Program. Students whose GPA is between 2.5 and 2.79 may be required to have an interview and provide a writing sample (approved Faculty Organization 3/18/05). Students enrolled in the College pur suing a Master's degree may be either full -time or part-time. Students enrolled in nine or more semester hours during a semester of an academic year or six or more semester hours during the summer session are full -time. Students enrolled in less than nine semester hours during a semester of an academic year or less than six semester hours during the summer session are part -time. A student may enroll in a maximum of nine semester hours as a student -at-large. All graduate students must be continuously enrolle d either full -time or part-time each semester. 35 Nondiscriminatory Policy The College admits qualified students without regard to national or ethnic origin, race, color, creed, sex, age, or disability that does not interfere with nursing performance or ot her legally protected category applicable to the College. International Students The RN -BSN and graduate students must be United States citizens to be admitted into their respective programs. Credit Hours The College of Nursing is on a semester system. One semester is sixteen weeks with an examination period provided at the end of each semester. One theory credit hour equals one clock hour or 50 minutes. Clinical hours are defined as three (3) clock hours equaling one credit hour in the undergraduate program and (4) clock hours equaling one credit hour in the graduate program. . REGISTRATION Course Placement Policy The College of Nursing strives to provide quality learning opportunities for students while maintaining the established student to faculty ratio. Seats in classes and clinical sections are limited ; therefore students are assigned in the following rank order: 1. Full-time students progressing successfully 2. Part-time students and RNs progressing successfully 3. Students who withdrew passing. These students will be assigned to clinical slots in the order that their letter requesting to repeat the class is received. 4. Students who were successfully progressing in the program and took a leave of absence. 5. Students who failed a course or who withdrew failing and wish to retake the class. 6. Transfer students from another c ollege of nursing. 7. Students applying for readmission to the College . If more than one student within the same category of the rank order seeks placement in a clinical course, (e.g., two part -time students and RNs progressing successfully), then the student's CON GPA would be the discerning factor in determining who would get assigned to the clinical course. The Students C alled to Active Military Duty Policy will apply to students who must withdr aw from the College due to orders for active military duty. Approved 3/27/2009 , Rev. 5/21/2015 Auditing a Course Courses without a laboratory or clinical component may be audited on a space available basis after all credit enrollments have been served. A student auditing a course is exempt from examinations, presentations and papers, but all other expectations remain the same. An auditor does not receive a grade or credit for the course. At the completion of the course , the transcript will show \"AU\" if attendance has been satisfactory or \"AX\" if not. A student must register for the course during the registration period and pay the regular tuition. To change from audit to credit or credit to audit, the student follows the Change in Registration Policy. Reviewed by A & P Committee: 4/23/10, 9/26/2014, 11/21/2014, 2/26/2016 36 STUDENT -AT-LARGE Students -at-large are students who wish to take classes but are not pursuing a degree or post grad certificate at the College. Students- at-large may earn credit for a maximum of 9 hours of credit. Students wishing to transfer the course credits to another college or university are advised to verify transferability with the receiving school prior to taking a course.

Courses taken as a student -at-large would be included in the GPA if the student decides to pursue a degree or certificate at the College (with the exception of 499 Statistics, when taken as a prerequisite). Students- at-large are subject to all College policies and must maintain a GPA of 2.0 or higher for undergraduate courses and 3.0 or higher for graduate level co urses in order to continue taking courses at the College. Students who have been academically dismissed may not take courses as a student -at-large. TRANSFER OF CREDIT The request for transfer of credit must be approved by the Dean of the appropriate program. Any student who plans on enrolling in a course at another institution while enrolled at the College should discuss this with the Dean of the appropriate program prior to enrollment. Only courses that are approved will be considered for transfer. Continuing education courses will not be considered for transfer. The student may request up to 9 hours of transfer credit. In the evaluation of courses from regionally accredited institutions, course descriptions and prerequisites, as listed in the catalogs of those institutions , will be studied. When information given is insufficient, it will be the student's responsibility to provide additional materials, such as the course outline or syllabus. To be eligible for transfer credit, the student must have: 1. Completed the course at a regionally accredited institution; 2. Achieved a grade of \"C\" or higher for undergr aduate or \"B\" or better for graduate students ; and 3. Completed the course within the last 5 years. To request transfer of credit, the student should submit: 1. An official transcript showing the course title, and grade; and 2. A catalog course description and course syllabus (if available). Quarter hours submitted for transfer credits are converted to semester hours based on the following formula: one quarter hour equals 2/3 of a semester hour. If a student transfers from one program to another, credit approved for the other program will not automatically be transferred. ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD (EHR) All students registered for courses wit h a clinical /practicum component are required to complete an electronic health record (EHR) training session , if applicable to the course. Sessions may be offered either through the College or through the OSF SFMC Learning Academy. As changes to the EHR occur, students may be required to complete mandatory training regarding these updates. Training, whether it is the initial training or the update training, may require the completion of an assigned web- based training (WBT) module PRIOR to the scheduled trai ning session. Failure to complete this WBT 37 will result in the student not being allowed to attend the scheduled training class, which could lead to the student being unable to participate in the clinical /practicum experience. If a student misses his/her s cheduled initial EHR training session, he/she is responsible for attending the next scheduled student class offered at either the College or through OSF SFMC Learning Academy. If there are no more student classes scheduled, student s should attend the next EHR session offered by the OSF SFMC or OSF SFMC Learning Academy. Any clinical experiences the student misses due to missing or not completing the required EHR training will be considered unexcused. Students may be advised to withdraw from the course if unable to meet clinical /practicum outcomes .

These considerations involve the weather forecast, status of snow removal, class cancellations, and the maint enance of essential College services. Decisions concerning class cancellations or College closure are undertaken by the President or designated Dean in the absence of the President. The possible decisions are: 1. Full College operations including scheduled classes with campus offices and facilities operational remain in effect. 2. Classes are cancelled with campus offices and facilities remaining operational. Employees should exercise judgment in terms of travel conditions. Designated essential College staff is required to report for duty as possible. 3. An emergency closure of the College is authorized due to a severe weather emergency. Classes are cancelled and all offices and facilities are closed. Among the options outlined above, condition 1 will apply in most circumstances. As a general rule, the College is always open. Employees and students need to decide whether travel from their location to the College will be hazardous. It is the personal responsibility of all faculty, staff, and students to make their own decisions and judgments concerning travel conditions and the danger of attending classes or coming to work under conditions which they personally believe to be unsafe.

Any student or member of the faculty wishing to conduct research on human subjects or anyone who would like to conduct research on faculty or studen ts at the College, must have the study reviewed by the Saint Francis Medical Center College of Nursing Research Committee. Research involving procedures not normally a part of the regular patient care or students' professional activities of the unit, clini c, or department must be reviewed by the College Research Committee. a. Submission of proposals for research should be made in writing to the Research Committee by submitting the proposal to the Dean of the Graduate Program two weeks prior to the meeting da te. The researcher, and the researcher's advisor, if the researcher is a student, should attend the Research Committee meeting in order to facilitate the process. b. Research from student investigators must provide written approval from the appropriate research advisor. c. Investigators desiring to do research on a unit, clinic, or department must obtain written permission from the manager prior to submitting the proposal to the Research Committee and get formal approval from the Professional Nursing Council. d. If the researcher plans to publish the findings, it is expected that the confidentiality of institution and human subjects will be respected. e. The Research committee meets as needed and is activated by the Dean of the Graduate Program. Approval of proposals by the Research Committee is dependent upon the analysis of factors which might affect the specific unit/population involved in the investigation: compliance with ethical concerns and protection of subjects; the number of projects in which a group of patients or staff members is already involved; the complexity of care, condition of patients, number of personal contacts and the amount of stress already affecting the patients or staff . CHANGE IN COURSE REG ISTRATION Course registration changes are per mitted without academic penalty during the first week of classes. Students should obtain an Add/Drop Form from the Office of the Registrar (or learning management system for graduate students) and secure the required signatures. After the first week , no c ourses may be added, and courses dropped are subject to the Course Withdrawal Policy. Course Withdrawal A student who wishes to withdraw from a course must request the appropriate form from the Registrar (or learning management system for graduate students) and obtain the necessary signatures. A student, who is authorized to withdraw from a course prior to the established date, will receive a grade of \"W\". The student should contact the Student Finance Office to determine the impact withdrawal will have on student's financial aid or billing statement per refund policies. Students receiving any financial aid may be subject to repayment of monies received. A student who withdraws from a course after the established date will receive a grade of \"WP\" withdrew passing, or \"WF\" withdrew failing, depending upon the level of course work at the time of withdrawal. A WF is the same as failing a course. No credit or quality points are given for either grade; however, the grade of \"WF\" is included in the calculation o f the student's grade point average. If the WF is a second course failure for a student, the student will be academically dismissed at the end of the semester but may continue in the other courses in which he/she is currently enrolled. Non -attendance or ve rbal notification to an employee 45 other than Registrar or Dean does not constitute a course withdrawal and will result in a failing grade. A student who withdraws from a course is no longer enrolled in the course and may no longer attend class. Undergraduat e students cannot withdraw from a single course more than one time , and graduate students cannot withdraw from a single course more than twice. A withdrawal of any type from the same course that exceeds the limit will result in academic dismissal from th e College.

(HESI) Exams Policy Purpose : To ensure student success in an academic environment that promotes a tradition of excellence in nursing education and enable the achievement of our success measure of \"NCLEX pass rates will be maintained at 90% for the first time writer .\" Objectives : 1. To foster a tradition of excellence in nursing education by use of a test with documented reliability and validity enabling the predict ion of the student's ability to successfully complete the program and pass the NCLEX -RN EXAM . 2. To provide students experience in testing in a computer environment as occurs with the NCLEX - RN EXAM . 3. To provide students immediate feedback upon completion of t he achievement tests. 4. To provide faculty advisors data to assist advisees in developing a successful plan of study in prepar ing for the NCLEX -RN EXAM . Scope : This academic testing policy covers all students prior to attending the College, at the com pletion of the J-2 academic semester as well as at the completion of the S -2 academic semester. Definitions : 1) Evolve Reach , powered by Health Education Systems, Incorporated (HESI) is a testing company that has products to help students pass the NCLEX -RN exam . Questions are developed by experts to reflect questions on the actual NCLEX -RN exam s, and all items have evidence- based reliability and validity to ensure accurate measurement of test scores and prediction of NCLEX -RN exam ination success. Immediate diagnostic reports are provided to identify areas that need further study. 2) Admission Assessment (A2) assesses academic readiness and identifies the student's learni ng style. Remediation is included. The A2 is used for assessment purposes only. 3) Our Mid -Curricular (MC) Exam , a custom made test developed by HESI, was constructed based on the first half of our curriculum and allows for a comprehensive evaluation of stude nts' knowledge after the Ju nior year in the BSN curriculum. A HESI on -line nursing tutorial and remediation program, will be used for those students who do not meet the benchmark score on the MC exam to provide assistance in their identified areas of need . 4) The Exit Exam (E2) evaluates student readiness for the NCLEX -RN exam , with predictive accuracy of 98.5%. Remediation is also available for this exam. General Guidelines: The A2, MC and E2 are all required exams. Students will take all HESI exams via computer at an off -campus site. The A2 will be taken prior to the beginning of the first semester. The MC and E2 exams will be taken at the end of the semester. Dates, times, and location of testing for the MC and E2 are available to students by mid -seme ster. Students are responsible for scheduling a testing time and providing their own transportation to the testing site. Students will know their results immediately following completion of the test. Students will complete a confidentiality statement at the time of HESI test taking, as these are secured exams. 51 All HESI tests include free remediation. Mid-Curricular (MC) Exam The MC exam reflects the curriculum of the junior year at the College. If the student does not attain the required 900 HESI score , the student will identify areas of weakness from his/her HESI exam. The student will do this by reviewing the exam results sent to the student in an email from HESI. The student may contact his/her advisor if any questions arise regarding HESI remediat ion. Students will be required to complete HESI remediation if the benchmark score of 900 is not achieved. Students must complete all of the required remediation no later than 9 AM on the Wednesday prior to the beginning of classes for the next academic term. Successful completion of the HESI mid -curricular exam is a prerequisite to Conceptual Basis for Nursing III. Successful completion is defined as achievement of a HESI score of 900 or greater or completion of assigned remediation. The College may admin istratively drop the student from Clinical Nursing III if the assigned remediation is not completed as required. This is a required college test. Failure to take the exam during the scheduled time is regarded as attaining less than the satisfactory score and the student will be required to complete the required remediation . HESI Exit Exam (E2) The Exit Exam is a part of the course grade for Conceptual Basis to Nursing IV Theory course. Students will not be allowed to retake the E2 for the purpose of im proving their course grade. Students are highly encouraged to complete remediation to improve performance on the NCLEX exam Revised and approved by Admission and Progression Committee 5- 2-14 College Senate Revised 5/22/2014 Retention The retention p rogram of the College of Nursing begins with the policy of accepting those students for admission who can be expected to successfully complete the program . Thereafter, student retention is facilitated through positive student interactions with faculty members in supportive, caring relationships. Faculty strives to be actively interested, approachable, available and accessible to students. Student involvement with faculty promotes an environment conducive to learning, fosters the development of self -esteem and self -actualization, and encourages intellectual inquiry. Positive interactions with faculty members contribute directly to student persistence in obtaining their degrees. Retention is promoted when faculty expectations of students are realistic, consi stent, and clearly understood by both parties. A variety of teaching strategies encourage student interest and participation. Retention is further facilitated when students receive early and frequent feedback regarding their academic progress. Frequent meetings with academic advisors provide opportunities to develop supportive faculty/student relationships, solicit student feedback, and direct students to resources available for academic or personal assistance. Support services foster program completion through contributions to student health and welfare. Good health practices are encouraged and assistance with health problems is available. The Counselor provides individual counseling , which includes teaching time and stress management skills, relaxation skills especially those related to test anxiety, and positive coping skills. The Academic Development 52 Center (ADC) provides individual assistance to students, as well as g roup sessions . Presentations on study skills and test taking skills, which are open to all students, are offered each semester . Language services for English language learners (ELL) students are also available. Resident Assistants (RA), the Students Offering Support group (SOS), and the Peer Teacher Program provide peer connectedness and s upport, which promotes retention for undergraduate students. The availability of financial assistance and financial literacy counseling through the Financial Aid Office further facilitates retention.

Procedures : The sections include definitions and procedures related to administrative, academic concerns, and site management. Administrative Definitions Distance Learning : Saint Francis Medical Center College of N ursing defines distance learning as a course whose delivery is predomina ntly online. This physical separation is bridged through the use of technology. Learning can take place synchronously, asynchronously, or a combination of both. Content delivery methods may include audio, video, computer technologies, internet, wireless communication devices, conferencing, DVDs, and CDs. Through interactivity students will create a connection between themselves, faculty, and their classmates. All students are accountabl e for their own learning and are expected to collaborate with faculty and other participants. Faculty members are responsible for creating safe and engaging environments for students to learn and interact while facilitating learning events. This is congrue nt with the mission and philosophy of the College. Blended or Hybrid Learning : involves the integration of online educational elements (as described above) into a traditional face -to-face course. Blended or Hybrid courses are taught in the traditional classroom setting and use a Learning Management System to distribute syllabi and course materials along with the integration of other features such as journaling, grade book, threaded discussions, dropbox, and email, which may replace inseat class attendance. All students are accountable for their own learning and are expected to collaborate with faculty and other participants. Faculty members are responsible for creating safe and engaging environments for students to learn and interact while facilitating lear ning events. Traditional Learning : involves courses that deliver content in the classroom, clinical, and may include web-enhanced activities that do not replace classroom attendance. Courses with the predominate amount of instruction occurring in clinica l settings with both the instructor/preceptor and student at the same place at the same time are considered traditional courses. All students are accountable for their own learning and are expected to collaborate with faculty and other participants. Facult y members are responsible for creating safe and engaging environments for student learning and interaction while facilitating learning activities. Learning Management System (LMS): is the software program used to deliver courses to students through the online format. The LMS used by Saint Francis Medical Center College of Nursing is eCollege. Student Information System (SIS): is a software program used for maintaining student records which contain the student's name, address, courses, and grades. The SIS used by Saint Francis Medical Center College of Nursing is SonisWeb. 54 Areas of Responsibility The College Board, administration, faculty, and students share in determining the desirability and the feasibility of using distance learning systems. The Col lege Board oversees the resources and implementation of the program. The Deans collaborate with the designated faculty, the Curriculum Committee, Graduate Committee, and College Senate to appropriately assign courses delivered online. The faculty assures t he rigor of the program and quality of instruction by retaining responsibilities for the curriculum, course development, implementation, evaluation and revision of the program. The Faculty agrees with the 1999 AAUP Statement on Distance Education, which as serts the fundamental principle that: As with all other curricular matters, the faculty should have primary responsibility for determining the policies and practices of the institution in regard to distance education. The rules governing distance education and its technologies should be approved by vote of the faculty... and published and distributed to all concerned. Students enrolled in distance learning courses will be expected to comply with course requirements. Administration will approve and overs ee technology acquisition and allocation of funds to support technology needs and provide academic, clerical, and technical assistance and provide faculty time for adequate preparation for course delivery. Administration will ensure that appropriate librar y resources and student support services are available, based on need. The Instructional Design and Technology Specialist will serve as support for the distance learning courses and/or programs offered through the distance learning equipment. Accountabili ty All students are accountable for their own learning and are expected to collaborate with faculty and other participants. Faculty members are responsible for creating safe and engaging environments for student learning and interaction while facilitating learning activities.

Revised and approved by Admission and Progression Committee on 1 /17/2013, 11/17/2015 Revised and Approved at College Senate: 4/2011; Effective Fall 2011, Rev 5/22/2014, 3/18/2016 Ethical and Professional Conduct Policy Scope -The E thical and Professional Conduct Policy establishes guidelines for faculty to use in cases of academic dishonesty, including cheating on tests and plagiarism, and unethical clinical behavior. Purpose -The purpose of the E thical and Professional Conduct Policy is to \"uphold our responsibility to create, maintain, and contribute to environments that support the growth of virtues...such as honesty\" ( American Nurses Association Code of Ethics 6.1), to support Saint Francis Medical Center College of Nursing (the College) values of integrity and justice, and to hold students accountable for professional an d moral behavior expected of nurses. Detailed Policy Statement -As a community dedicated to the principled pursuit of knowledge and truth, the College regards integrity and honesty as foundational to all aspects of education and the 61 nursing profession. W e understand ethical and professional conduct in terms of five fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility (Center for Academic Integrity, 1999). The College thus expects the following of its students, faculty, and staff: \"Intellectual and personal honesty in learning, teaching, research, and service\" (p. 5). \"Mutual trust and the free exchange of ideas\" (p. 6). \"Respect of a wide range opinions, ideas, and persons\" (p. 8). \"Fairness in the interaction of students, faculty, staff, and administrators\" (p. 7). \"Personal responsibility for choices and the importance of action in the face of wrong doing\" (p. 9). This policy was based upon the assumption that most students want to grow and flourish in the following values. There fore, the CON invites students to commit to the following habits of excellence appropriate for professional formation and which establish a foundation for professional development. The professional nurse: Seeks the formation of one's character through the development of the virtues of wisdom, honesty, courage, compassion and patience (American Nurses Association, 2001). Communicates respect for the inherent dignity of persons (peers, patients, and faculty/staff/administration) as the basis for compassionate responses. Preserves, strengthens, and demonstrates personal moral respect and integrity as foundations of wholeness of character, in the formation of knowledge, skill, and trust. Recognizes and appreciates diversity of persons and seeks to grow in h abits of effective and excellent communication and collaboration. Interprets and accepts this SFMC -CON Honor Pledge and commitment as an orientation toward the American Nurses Association (ANA) Code of Ethics. Practices moral self -reflection so as to ap preciate the promise of accountability and responsibility in the life of the student nurse, which links each classroom/learning activity to the professional care of patients. Lives moral virtues and follows ethical principles (autonomy, beneficence, just ice and autonomy) within a learning community which seeks to also live the core values of OSF (teamwork, supportive work environment, trust, and stewardship). Definitions: Academic honesty constitutes behaviors that demonstrate truthfulness, tru st, fairness, respect, and responsibility in academic and clinical settings (Center for Academic Integrity, 1999). Academic dishonesty consists of activities such as cheating on examinations, plagiarizing, presenting someone else's work as his/her own, r eceiving improper assistance on assignments, and intentionally facilitating cheating on the part of others (Elzubeir and Rizk, 2003). Plagiarism - \"In an instructional setting, plagiarism occurs when a writer deliberately uses someone else's language, ideas, or other original (not common -knowledge) material without acknowledging its source\" (Council of Writing Program Administrators, 2003, p.1). Misuse of Sources- \"A student who attempts (even if clumsily) to identify and credit his or her source, but who misuses a specific citation format or incorrectly uses quotation marks or other forms of 62 identifying material taken from other sources, has not plagiarized. Instead, such a student should be considered to have failed to cite and document sources appropria tely.\" (Council of Writing Program Administrators, 2003, p. 2). \"Cheating -an act or an attempted act of deception by which a student seeks to misrepresent that he or she has mastered information that has not been mastered. Cheating includes, but is not l imited to: Copying all or any portion of another's academic or clinical work and submitting it, in part or in its entirety, as one's own; Allowing another person to copy one's own academic or clinical work \u2014whether intentionally or recklessly; The use or possession of a class textbook, notes, test questions, clinical paperwork or any other material in order to complete or prepare academic [or clinical] work without prior approval of the faculty; Collaboration with any other person on an academic or clinic al exercise, including collaboration on a take -home, online, or make -up academic [or clinical] exercise without prior approval of the faculty; The use of electronic instruments, such as cell phones, pagers, Personal Digital Assistants (PDA), or personal r esponse systems (i.e. clickers), etc. in order to access or share information without prior approval of the faculty; or Completion of academic [or clinical] work for another person, or permitting someone else to complete academic or clinical work for oneself, including through the use of personal response systems such as clickers\" (University of Delaware, 2010). Fabrication or Falsification of Data -\"constructing observations or data out of one's head, as if it were true, or borrowing the observations of ot hers as if they were one's own genuine data\" (Yale College, 2010). Multiple submissions -\"submitting the same work, such as a paper, (or substantially the same work) for more than one assignment or course\" unless approved by course faculty (Yale College, 20 10). Unethical Clinical Behavior -behavior that is dishonest, may put the client's safety and best interest at risk, or disadvantages the healthcare institution. Some examples include but are not limited to: failing to act as a patient advocate, breaching confidentiality, stealing, falsifying documentation, or coming to clinical under the influence of drugs or alcohol (Hilbert, 1985). Violations of academic honesty will result in disciplinary action. Actions will include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: Automatic failure of the work Automatic failure of the course Dismissal from the College Saint Francis Medical Center College of Nursing Honor Code As member of the community at Saint Francis Medical Center College of Nursing, I commit myself to act honestly, responsibly, and ethically, in all aspects of campus life.

The wording is written for employees, but students will be held to the same social media policy as employees and must also comply . The College of Nursing also follows the guidelines on social media and networking for nurses developed by the American Nurses Association ( ANA) and the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN).

Harassment, bullying, discrimination or retaliation that would not be permissible in the workplace is not permissible between co -workers on- line. 2. Keep in mind that you are more likely to resolve work -related complaints by speaking directly with your co- workers than by posting c omplaints to a social media outlet. 3. Make sure you are always honest and accurate when posting information or news, and if you make a mistake, correct it quickly. Remember that the Internet archives almost everything; therefore, even deleted postings can be searched. Never post any information or rumors that you know to be false about OSF Healthcare System, its employees, or its patients. 4. Social media activities should be consistent with the OSF Standards of Conduct. The same principles and guidelines found in all OSF policies apply to your activities online. Carefully read all of OSF Healthcare System's ethical and discrimination/harassment rules in order to ensure that your postings are consistent with these policies. 5. Employees should only express personal opinions, recommendations or endorsements on social media. Where your connection to OSF Healthcare System is apparent, make it clear that you are speaking for yourself and not on behalf of OSF Healthcare System. In those circumstances, you should include t his disclaimer: \"The views expressed on this [blog; website] are my own and do not reflect the views of my employer.\" If the site has an \"About me\" section, add the above disclaimer to your blog or social media profile. Do not create a link from your blog, website or other social networking site to an OSF Healthcare System website without identifying yourself as an OSF Healthcare System employee. 6. Do not share confidential or proprietary information that you acquire in the course of your employment with OSF Healthcare System. Examples of confidential or propriety information include protected health information (as defined by HIPAA), information about prospective OSF 68 business plans, trade secrets, systems, processes, products, know -how, technology, internal reports, policies, procedures, or other internal business -related confidential communications. Maintain patient privacy as required by HIPAA and all other relevant rules, regulations and policies.

Unless explicitly given permission to do so by your operating unit's Marketing and Communications Department, do NO T speak on behalf of OSF Healthcare System or represent yourself as a spokesperson for OSF Healthcare System. 8.

Any OSF HealthCare employee who abuses the Social Media Policy is subject to the Positive Discipline Policy. The College follows the guidelines on social media and networking for nurses developed by the American Nurses Association (ANA) and th e National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) as outlined below. ANA's Principles for Social Networking and the Nurse (https://www.nursingworld.org ) (August 2011) Nurses must not transmit or place onlin e individually identifiable patient information. Nurses must observe ethically prescribed professional patient -nurse boundaries. Nurses should understand that patients, colleagues, institutions, and employers may view postings. Nurses should take advantage of privacy settings and seek to separate personal and professional information online. Nurses should bring content that could arm a patient's' privacy, rights, or welfare to the attention of appropriate authorities. Nurses should participate in developing institutional policies governing online conduct. ANA's 6 tips to Avoid Problems (https://www.nursingworld.org ) (August 2011) Remember that standards of professionalism are the same online as in any other cir cumstance. Do not share or post information or photos gained through the nurse -patient relationship. Maintain professional boundaries in the use of electronic media. Online contact with patients blurs this boundary. Don't make disparaging remarks about pat ients, employers, or co -workers, even if they are not identified. Do not take photos or videos of patients on personal devices, including cell phones. Promptly report a breach of confidentiality or privacy. 69 The College of Nursing also recommends review of the NCSBN white paper, \"A Nurse's Guide to the Use of Social Media\" found at https://ncsbn.org/Social_Media.pdf . Students must adhere to all clinical agency policies regarding confidentiality, as well as use of social media. Inappropriate use of social media is a violation of the College's Professional Standards policy related to confidentiality and HIPAA located in the Student Handbook . Violations of the Professional Standards will be referred to the appropriate person/committee: College Administration, the Admission & Progression Committee, Graduate Committee, or the Judicial Board. Disciplinary action will include but is not limited to: reprimand, fines, suspension, or dismissal from the College. October 2010 References American Nurses Association (ANA). (2011).

Dissatisfaction with a grade is not a sufficient reason to appeal the grade. In order to provide a mechanism for the fair resolution of disagreements, the College has developed an Appeal Procedure for students. Students have the right to appeal grades, academic or student policies, and disciplinary action resulting from violation of academic or student policies. All parts of the Appeal Procedure will be private and all persons present will consider all information presented to be confidential. However, if the student discloses info rmation discussed during a meeting, the student's interest in the confidentiality will be deemed waived. 74 The student has the right to appeal any decision. At either a Student Appeal or a Disciplinary Action Appeal, a student is entitled to be accompanied at the hearing by a fellow student, parent or representative, who may be an attorney. I. Academic Appeal Procedure The student initiating an appeal should be prepared to document evidence for the appeal. At this time, the student may seek the assistan ce of the academic advisor. Appeals should be settled at the lowest possible level. A student appealing a grade may continue in the academic program during the review process unless there is reason to believe such continuance would jeopardize the well - being of the student or others. The appeal should be initiated within ten (10) business days after the grade is issued by the Instructor or Registrar. If the specified time limits are not met by the student, the issue shall not be subject to further appeal. Ea ch appeal step listed below must be accomplished before proceeding to the next step. The decision at each step will be documented. 1. The student should make a sincere effort to resolve the issue with the instructor assigning the grade or faculty member in charge of the course. 2. If the issue is unresolved, the student should submit a written request for a meeting with the appropriate Dean within ten (10) business days . If the appropriate Dean is the instructor assigning the grade, the written request sh ould be submitted to the other Dean. The request shall specify the nature of the issue and attempts made to resolve the issue. The Dean shall meet with the student within ten (10) business days of the receipt of the request. The student is given adequate n otice in writing at this step and all subsequent steps of the date, time, and place of the meeting. The Dean makes a decision which resolves the issue or recommends that it is taken to the Admission and Progression Committee or the Graduate Committee ( for graduate students ). 3. If unresolved, the student submits a formal written appeal to the Admission and Progression Committee or Graduate Committee chairperson within ten (10) business days of the meeting with the Dean. 4. The student and instructor shall be given due notice of the date and time of the Admission and Progression Committee or Graduate Committee Meeting. The meeting will be held within ten (10) business days of the student's request. The President will not be in attendance at the arranged Comm ittee Meeting . Each party may present evidence or witnesses to the issue. The committee may question each party. Following a period of closed deliberation, the decision of the Committee will be forwarded in writing to both parties and the President within three business days following the meeting. 5. If the decision of the Committee is unacceptable to the student or instructor, either may file a written notice of intent to further appeal to the President within three (3) business days of receipt of the deci sion. 6. The President shall have a maximum of ten (10) business days to call a meeting of both parties to resolve the situation. The President will review all current records or documentation relating to the appeal. No new documentation may be introduced at this time. If necessary to avoid undue hardship or injustice to either party, the President may extend the ten (10) day limitation. 7. The President may approve or reverse the decision of the Committee. 8. The written decision of the President shall be sent to both parties and the appropriate Dean no later than three (3) business days following the appeal meeting . 9.

Disciplinary Appeal Procedure For the appeal process regarding disciplinary actions, th e disciplinary appeal procedure set forth below will be used. 75 Judicial Board A Judicial Board is formed to act on cases of violations of the Student Code of Conduct/Professional Standards. (See Professional Conduct) The Judicial Board shall consist o f: 1. Three faculty members. 2. Chairperson shall be a faculty member elected by the Board. 3. Two students selected by the Judicial Board. The faculty representatives will be elected as provided in the by -laws of the College Senate. A quorum of the Boa rd shall consist of all members.

All decisions require a majority vote ex cept for dismissal or suspension, which require an affirmative vote of at least four. In the event the College recommends suspension or dismissal of the student, such suspension or dismissal shall be put on hold during the appeal/hearing procedure set for th below. Only if the recommendation of suspension or dismissal is based on violation of Professional Standards which places students, faculty, patients or any other person in immediate harm or danger will the student be suspended during the appeal/hearing procedure. In no event, will the student be dismissed from the College until the President has rendered a final decision under the disciplinary appeal procedure. Appeal/Hearing Procedure 1. The student must submit a written request to appeal within fi ve (5) business days of receiving such a disciplinary action. The written request must be accompanied by rationale for a hearing to the President within five (5) business days of receipt of the decision.

If non -emerg ency transport is needed, call Advanced Medical Transport (494 -6200) and advise them of the need for a non- emergency transport. 2. If the person is unconscious or in respiratory distress, notify 911 immediately. 3. If doubt or concern in regards to the situation, contact the health nurse or counselor who will arrange for assistance. In their absence, notify administration, faculty or staff to respond to the urgent need. 4. Provide the emergency transport with information regarding the situation, age, sex, current status, what started the situation and what is currently taking place. 5. Direct someone to meet the emergency personnel at the designated door and bring them to the person in distress. 6. While waiting for assistance, stay with the person by remaining with them until help arrives. This new policy will allow us to act quickly and benefit all to the best of our ability. 112 The desired outcome will be that all who need emergency assistance in a situation understand that SFMC College of Nursing has the ethical and mo ral right to call \"911\" for help when the party in distress is unable to make the decision for themselves. The person who was in need of assistance will be responsible for the cost obtained (financial responsibility will not be that of SFMC CON). This p olicy will benefit all by allowing us to care and provide care for those in need. It will also establish boundaries or financial responsibility being that of the person.

Earth quake Potential Most tremors are west of the Rocky Mountains. However 39 states are a potential target for earthquakes. Saint Francis Medical Center College of Nursing is on the north edge of a potentially major quake area. II. Occur suddenly and with little or no warning. III. Affect entire communities thereby usually making community services unavailable for assistance. IV. Injuries are caused by: A. Building collapse or damage, such as falling brick, light fixtures, collapsing walls, etc. B. Flying glass from broken windows. C. Overturned bookcases, fixtures, furniture, appliances, equipment, etc. D. Fires from broken gas lines, etc. This danger could be aggravated by a lack of water caused by broken mains. E. Fallen power lines. F. Drastic human reaction resulting from fear. V. What To Do During the Shaking Occurrence A. Don't panic. The motion is frightening but, unless it shakes something down on top of you, it is harmless. Keep calm and ride it out. The earth DOES NOT yawn open, gulp down a neighborhood and slam shut. Reassure students, residents, other employees and visitors. B. If INDOORS, stay indoors. Take cover under desk, tables, in doorways, halls and against wall. Stay away from glass. C. Do NOT use candles, matches or any open flam e, either during or after a tremor. Put out ALL fires. D. If OUTSIDE, move away from buildings and utility wires. Once in the open, stay there until shaking stops, do not attempt to remain standing. Do not run through, to, or near buildings. The greatest danger from falling debris is just outside doorways and close to outer walls. E. If in a moving vehicle, stop as quickly as safety permits, but stay in vehicle. A car will jiggle fearsomely on its springs during the earthquake; but it is a good place to stay until the shaking stops. F. If in a high- rise building, get under a desk or similar heavy furniture. DO NOT dash for exits, since stairways may be broken and/or jammed with people. NEVER use elevators. G. Keep residents, students, visitors, and other e mployees out of stairwells and elevators. H. The most important thing to remember is to remain calm. Reassure and assist students, residents, visitors and other employees. DO NOT ABANDON YOUR POST. 114 IV. What To Do After the Shaking Occurrence A. STAY C ALM. B. Assemble personnel at predetermined location. Take a head count of employees, residents, students, and known visitors. C Shut off/conserve all unnecessary utilities, equipment and hazardous material supply lines. D. Put out or contain fires as required. E. If you smell gas, open windows and notify Security. Leave rooms and areas with heavy gas leakage. F. Do not use telephones except to report emergencies. G. Assess damage, supplies needed, functioning capability, etc. H. Notify President /Dean or C ollege Staff of assessed status. I. Stand by in your immediate area for internal directions. J. Give aid to others in your area as it is available. K. Check for injuries. Do not move injured persons unless in immediate danger of further injury. L. Immediat ely clean up spilled liquids and other harmful materials. M. DO NOT eat or drink anything from open containers near shattered glass. N. DO NOT touch downed power lines or objects touched by the downed or shorted power supply lines. O.

One way caring is reflected is the commitment to maintaining a healthy drug and alcohol free environment. I want to address with you briefly a matter of great importance to all of us. One of the pitfalls on any campus is drug and alcohol abuse. Monroe (2009) states that there is an increased risk for alcohol and substance dependence by nurses and nursing students. Alco hol and drug use has been found to interfere with succeeding with classroom and exam performance, the quality of clinical performance, and patient care. I hope this section of the Student Handbook helps you to make healthy informed decisions. The Drug/Alc ohol Abuse Prevention Section in the Student Handbook has important points for you to consider as you make decisions about drugs and alcohol. First I want you to be safe. Some of the common risk factors are binge -drinking and driving under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol, which puts you at risk for injury and death. Alcohol and drug abuse can lead to impaired judgment. You cannot protect yourself as effective while under the influence of drugs and alcohol. According to the law, you must be 21 or ol der to consume alcohol; otherwise you are at risk for arrest. I challenge you to make the best of your time here at the College of Nursing both socially and academically. This Handbook and the programs provided at the College of Nursing are designed to as sist you with making the best choices. I ask you to commit yourself to being responsible for your own well -being and that of your fellow students and employees. Best wishes, Patricia A. Stockert, RN, PhD President 128 INTRODUCTION This information has been prepared to fulfill the requirements of the Drug- Free Workplace Act of 1988 (Public Law 101- 690), and Section 22 of The Drug- Free Schools and Communities Act Amendments of 1989 (Public Law 101- 226).

In an effort to a ssist you in becoming responsible colleagues within the nursing profession, the following information has been prepared.

BINGE DRINKING According to Nakate (2011), binge drinking is \"heavy consumption of alcohol, approximately 5 standard drinks for men and 4 drinks for women usually in a short span of time\". Consuming the same number of drinks over a long span of time is not considered to be binge drinking. If this type of heavy drinking occurs 3 times in a period of 2 weeks it is considered to be heavy binge drinking. College students are among the fastest growing group of people who binge drink. Some of the factors involved are peer pressure, trying to \"fit in\", or just be more social. Even though the legal drinking age in the US is 21, the growing number of college students who suffer from alcohol addiction show that the age limit is defied in most cases. In 2003, the percentage of first -semester boys and girls who binged at least twice a week was 41 and 34 respectively. 132 Among college students high concentrations of alcohol can have the following effects: Drinking affects sleeping patterns. Irregular sleeping patterns can cause problems with concentration, poor grades, ultimately leading to dropping out of college. Drinking can lead to anger and irritation severing relations with friends and family. Depression can be a result of heavy alcohol consumption. Intoxication leads to losing control of your actions and ability to think clearly. This can lead to violent criminal behavior. Drinking and driving is a dangerous to human lives. College students who drink and drive account for more than 50% of all accidents. College students face many challenges and binge drinking is one of them. As you can see there are many consequences of bi nge drinking and some of them are permanent. Binge drinking not only impacts our health negatively but also impacts those around us.

These are drugs that are sometimes used to assist a sexual assault. They can be slipped into your drink when you are not looking. The drugs often have no color, smell, or taste so you can't tell if you are being drugged. The drugs can make you become weak, confused or even pass out so that you are unable to refuse sex or defend yourself. The 3 most common date rape drugs are: Rohypnol, GHB and Ketam ine. Rohypnol (flunitrazepam) is also known as: Circles R-2 Rope Forget Pill Rib Rophies La Rochas Roach Ruffies Lunch Money Roopies What it does : Loss of muscle control Amnesia Loss of consciousness Dizzy Difficulty with motor movements Nausea/stomach problems Confusion Low blood pressure Drunk feeling Problems talking Problems seeing Death Rohypnol is being replaced in some parts of the US with clonazepam (Klonipen) and alprazolam (Xanax). It comes as a pill or can be ground into a powder. This drug also may contain a dye that can turn your drink bright blue or cloudy. If you have a dark drink, it may be hard to notice a color change. GHB (gamma h ydroxybutyric acid) is also known as: Bedtime Scoop G-Juice Liquid Ecstasy Cherry Meth Gook Liquid X Easy Lay Goop PM Energy Drink Great Hormones Salt Water G Grievous Bodily Harm Soap Gamma 10 Liquid E Somatomax Georgia Home Boy GBH Vita-G What i t does: Relaxation Drowsiness Dizziness Nausea Problems seeing Loss of Consciousness Seizures Amnesia Problems breathing Tremors Sweating Vomiting Slow heart rate Dream like feeling Coma Death GHB comes as an odorless, colorless liquid, a white powder and a pill. It may give your drink a salty taste. Sweet and fruit juice drinks can mask the salty taste. Ketamine is also known as: Black Hole Bump Cat Valium Green Jet K K-Hole Special K Kit Kat Psychedelic Heroin Purple Super Acid What it does: Distorted sight and sound perception Lost sense of time and identity Out of body experience Dream like feeling Feeling out of control Impaired motor function Problems breathing Convulsions Vomiting Memory problems Numbness Loss of coordination Aggress ive or violent behavior Depression High blood pressure Slurred speech 134 Ketamine comes as a liquid and a white powder. The club- drug Ecstasy can be slipped into a drink. It can also be taken willingly to make a person feel 'lovey -dovey\" towards others. I t lowers a person's ability to give reasoned consent while under the influence. Even if a victim of sexual assault drank alcohol or willingly took drugs, the victim is NOT at fault for being assaulted. You cannot 'ask for it' or cause it to happen. If you suspect you have been drugged, you should seek medical assistance. If an assault has occurred, you should not have to pay for any drug testing, as it will be covered under the Sexual Assault Survivors Emergency Treatment Act (SASETA). However, if there has been no assault, but you would like testing, you may have to pay for it yourself.

If a student withdraws from the College or any course(s) at any time without having completed the official process, no refund credit will be made. The College reserves the right to modify the refund schedule as circumstances may dictate. Fall and Spring Semester Summer Session Week s 1 & 2: 100% Refund Week 1 : 100 % Refund Week 3: 40% Refund Week 2 : 20% Refund Week 4: 20% Refund After Week 4: 0% Refund Additional Notes: The student's allocation of any refund is distributed only after the requirements of federal and non- federal aid programs are satis fied. See the Financial Aid Return of Funds Policy for additional information. Financial Aid Return of Funds Policy Federal Title IV Funds1 The Higher Education Amendments of 1998, Public Law 105- 244 mandate the way funds paid toward a student's education are to be calculated when a recipient of Title IV funds withdraws from the semester. A statutory federal formula is applied through the 60% point of each semester to determine the amount of Title IV funds a student has earned at the \"date of withdrawal \"2. (After the 60% point in the semester, a student has earned 100% of the Title IV funds.) The amount of unearned Title IV aid disbursed 3 to the student must be returned. The institution and the student share the responsibility in returning funds. (The division of returning funds will depend on what funds were received and how they were disbursed.) Title IV funds returned by the College must be in the following order: Unsubsidized loan, Subsidized loan, PLUS Loan, Pell. Eligible earned aid not disbursed prior to withdrawing will be applied first to any outstanding student account balance for allowable charges. Statutory Federal Formula Earned Percentage of Title IV Aid Determine the calendar days completed in the semester of enrollment divided by t he total calendar days in the semester of enrollment (exclude scheduled breaks of 5 days or more AND days that the student was on an official approved leave of absence 4). Unearned Percentage of Title IV Aid 100% Aid Disbursed - % Earned Aid = % Unearned Aid (Title IV Return) Example: Days Completed - 19 \u00f7 Total Days in the Semester 115 = .1652 = 16.5% Earned Aid 100% Aid Disbursed - 16.5% Earned Aid = 83.5% Unearned Aid (Title IV Return) $5,000.00 Aid Disbursed - $825.00 Earne d Aid = $4,175.00 Unearned Aid (Title IV Return) Effective Date: Semesters beginning on or after July 1, 2000 1Federal Title IV Funds (at SFMC CON) - Pell Grant, Federal Stafford Student Loans (Subsidized and Unsubsidized) and Federal PLUS loan. 147 2 Date of withdrawal - A student who wishes to withdraw from a semester must request the appropriate form from the Registrar or Associate Dean and obtain the necessary signatures. Non -attendance or verbal notification to an employee other than the Registrar or Associate Dean does not constitute a withdrawal. The date of withdrawal is the date the form is filed. 3 Disbursed - Aid that has been applied to the student's account for tuition, fees and other allowable charges and/or aid that was disbursed directly to the student or parent (PLUS loan). 4 Leave of Absence - The student must follow the leave of absence policy as written in College publications (Catalog, Student Handbook, SFMC CON Website).

Quantitative Measurement (Credit Hours) Each semester, the student must successfully complete two thirds (or more) of cumulative credit hours attempted (rounded up to the nearest whole credit hour). Grades of C (graduate program only), D, F, U, W, WF, WP or I are not counted as successful completion of credit hours, but are counted as attempted credit hours. If a grade change report is received from the Director of Admissions/Registrar, Satisfactory Academic Progress will be re -evaluated to determine eligibility to receive further financial assistance.

ADDITIONAL COLLEGE POLICIES AND INFORMATION FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT The information presented here is in compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974. The Act requires that students be informed annually of their rights and of the College 's policies and procedures in compliance. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) afford students certain rights with respect to their education records. They ar e: (1) The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days of the day the College receives a request for access. (2) The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the student believes are inaccurat e or misleading. (3) The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception, which permits disclosure wi thout consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the College in an administrative, 153 supervisory, academic or research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the College has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the College Board; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or griev ance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility. Upon request, the College discloses education records without consent to officials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll, after, making a reasonable attempt to notify the student of the records request. (4) The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the College to comply with the requirements of FERPA.

At the formal hearing, a College administrative person or a person who has no direct interest in the problem will represent the College . The student will be given a copy of the record prior to the meeting, if desired. The cost of each copy, $2 per sheet, will be paid by the student. The student will be given a fair hearing and will be permitted to present evidence to the issue being discussed. The student will receive a written decision within thirty days. A copy of the decision and of the student's request will be placed in the student's file. This part of the Act is to insure that the record is not inaccurate, misleading or in violatio n of the student's rights. It does not permit the student to challenge a grade.

Copies of requests and of the student's consent will be kept in the student's file. Each copy released to a third party or to the student will be at the expense of the student. All transcripts and other materials will carry the College Seal. The Act provides for the College to release information to personnel of the College who are determined by the College to have legitimate educational interest and to officials of other schools in which the s tudent intends to enroll. The student will be notified of the request; receive a copy of the requested material if desired; and have the opportunity to challenge the record. The student is charged for each copy of the material sent to these schools and to the student.

Student signature:______________________________________________ Date:___________________ College Support Representative:__________________________________ NO.: Appearance OSF Saint Francis Medical Center ____________________________________________________________________________________ OSF HealthCare is dedicated to having all employees present a professional appearance to those we serve. An organization may be judged not only by the quality of its services but by the appearance of those providing the services. Therefore, whi le freedom of individual expression and changing styles and fashion are recognized, it remains important to convey a sense of professionalism to patients and their families, visitors and business associates. Appropriate clothing and good habits in personal hygiene are important aspects in personal appearance. It is the responsibility of all OSF leadership to assure that employees are dressed in an acceptable manner consistent with their specific environment, and appropriate for interaction with individual s they come in contact with. In order for OSF HealthCare to continue to maintain a professional atmosphere, attitude, and to promote safety for all employees, the following information is intended to serve as a guide to help define appropriate dress for em ployees in various settings. It is not intended to be all inclusive. Rather, it sets the general parameters for proper attire and allows employees to make intelligent judgments about items that are not specifically addressed. Department leadership is respo nsible for interpretation of the guidelines, and as necessary, may require more stringent or restrictive, but not more lenient, dress codes, as deemed necessary by their functions. Department specific requirements must be approved by the appropriate Vice P resident. If there is any doubt about whether an article of apparel is appropriate, assume it is not. When in doubt, dress conservatively. All clothing must be neat & clean, properly fitted, and meet the job specific requirements.

Sexual misconduct, like unlawful harassment on the basis of race, age, disability, religion or any other protected class, is a form of discrimination expr essly prohibited by law. Sexual misconduct is a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, of Title IX of the Education Act Amendments of 1972, and of the Illinois Human Rights Act. The College will not tolerate, condone or subject anyone to such misconduct. In addition to being illegal, sexual misconduct violates the dignity of the individual and the integrity of the College as an institution of learning. Likewise, the College does not tolerate domestic violence, dating violence or stalking , regardless of whether these acts are based on an individual's sex. Domestic violence, dating violence and stalking are crimes in Illinois and are subject to criminal prosecution. Academic freedom can exist only when each person is free to pursue ideas in a non- threatening, non- coercive atmosphere of mutual respect. The College is therefore committed to fully investigating and addressing any instances of sexual misconduct, domestic or dating violence and stalking of which it receives notice. Students perpetrating such acts will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including expulsion. And, employees perpetrating such acts will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Accordingly, the College has adopted the following policy (hereinafter referred to as the \"Policy\"). JURISDICTION This Policy applies to everyone who is a part of the College community, including students, employees, visitors, volunteers and contractors, regardless of sex, sexual orientation or gender ide ntity. It includes conduct occurring on campus, as well as conduct occurring off -campus that is related to the College's programs or activities, or which may create a hostile environment on campus or in a College program or activity. NOTE ON TERMINOLOGY Throughout this Policy, the term \"victim\" is often used to denote an individual who is alleged to have been victimized by sexual misconduct, domestic or dating violence or stalking. Likewise, the term \"perpetrator\" is, at times, used to denote the individu al alleged to have engaged in one of these acts. The use of these terms is consistent with the language of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 and should not be construed as a pre -judgment as to whether a violation of this Policy occurr ed. It should further be noted that this Policy uses the umbrella term \"sexual misconduct\" to encompass a range of conduct, including sexual harassment, sexual assault and sexual exploitation. By using the term \"misconduct,\" the College does not intend to diminish the serious nature of any type of sexual harassment, violence or exploitation. Finally, the term \"employee\" is used throughout this Policy and is intended to include all faculty members, administrators, staff and other employees of the College. 183 PROHIBITED CONDUCT Sexual Assault What Is Prohibited No person may engage in sexual assault . Definitions Sexual Assault \"Sexual assault\" is actual or attempted sexual contact with another person without that person's consent . Sexual assault includes, but is not limited to: Intentional touching of another person's intimate parts without that person's consent ; or Other intentional sexual contact with another person without that person's consent ; or Coercing, forcing, or attempting to coerce or force a person to touch another person's intimate parts without that person's consent ; or Penetration, no matter how slight, of (1) the vagina or anus of a person by any body part of another person or by an object, or (2) the mouth of a person by a sex organ of ano ther person, without that person's consent . Consent (Applicable to Sexual Assault) \"Consent\" must be informed, voluntary and mutual, and can be withdrawn at any time. There is no consent when there is force, expressed or implied, or when coercion, intimidation, threat or duress is used. Whether a person has taken advantage of a position of influence over another person may be a factor in determining consent. Silence or absence of resistance does not imply consent. Past consent to sexual activity with an other person does not imply ongoing future consent with that person or consent to that same sexual activity with another person. Evidence of a prior consensual dating relationship between the parties by itself does not imply consent or preclude a finding of sexual misconduct. If a person is mentally or physically incapacitated or impaired so that such person cannot understand the fact, nature or extent of the sexual situation, there is no consent; this includes impairment or incapacitation due to alcohol o r drug consumption that meets this standard, or being asleep or unconscious. Sexual Exploitation What Is Prohibited No person may engage in sexual exploitation . Definitions Sexual Exploitation \"Sexual exploitation\" occurs when a person takes sexual advan tage of another person for the benefit of anyone other than that person without that person's consent . Examples of behavior that could rise to the level of sexual exploitation include: Prostituting another person; Recording images (e.g., video, photograph ) or audio of another person's sexual activity, intimate body parts or nakedness without that person's consent ; Distributing images (e.g., video, photograph) or audio of another person's sexual activity, intimate body parts or nakedness, if the individual distributing the images or audio knows or should have known that the 184 person depicted in the images or audio did not consent to such disclosure and objects to such disclosure; and, Viewing another person's sexual activity, intimate body parts or nakedness i n a place where that person would have a reasonable expectation of privacy, without that person's consent , and for the purpose of arousing or gratifying sexual desire. Consent (Applicable to Sexual Exploitation) \"Consent\" must be informed, voluntary and m utual, and can be withdrawn at any time. There is no consent when there is force, expressed or implied, or when coercion, intimidation, threats or duress is used. Whether a person has taken advantage of a position of influence over another person may be a factor in determining consent. Silence or absence of resistance does not imply consent. Past consent to a particular activity with another person does not imply ongoing future consent with that person or consent to that same activity with another perso n. Evidence of a prior consensual dating relationship between the parties by itself does not imply consent or preclude a finding of sexual misconduct. If a person is mentally or physically incapacitated or impaired so that such person cannot understand the fact, nature or extent of the situation, there is no consent; this includes impairment or incapacitation due to alcohol or drug consumption that meets this standard, or being asleep or unconscious. Sex-Based Harassment What Is Prohibited No person may engage in sex -based harassment that creates a hostile environment in or under any program or activity of this College. No person who is an employee or agent of this College (including a student employee) may condition a decision or benefit on a student's o r employee's submission to sex-based harassment . Definitions Sex-Based Harassment \"Sex -based harassment\" includes sexual harassment and gender -based harassment . Sexual Harassment \"Sexual harassment\" is unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, including, but not limited to, unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or nonverbal conduct of a sexual nature, including sexual assault and sexual exploitation. In addition, depending on the facts, dating violence, domestic violence and s talking may also be for ms of sexual harassment . (See \"Sexual Assault\" on page 183, \"Sexual Exploitation\" on page 183, \"Domestic and Dating Violence\" on page 187, and \"Stalking\" on page 187 .) Gender -Based Harassment \"Gender -based harassment\" is unwe lcome conduct of a nonsexual nature based on a person's actual or perceived sex, including conduct based on gender identity, gender expression and nonconformity with gender stereotypes. 185 Unwelcome Conduct is considered \"unwelcome\" if the person did not request or invite it and considered the conduct to be undesirable or offensive. Unwelcome conduct may take various forms, including, name -calling, graphic or written statements (including the use of cell phones or the Internet) or other conduct that may be physically threatening, harmful or humiliating. Unwelcome conduct does not have to include intent to harm, be directed at a specific target or involve repeated incidents. Unwelcome conduct can involve persons of the same or opposite sex. Participation in the conduct or the failure to complain does not always mean that the conduct was welcome. The fact that a person may have welcomed some conduct does not necessarily mean that the person welcomed other conduct. Also, the fact that a person requested or inv ited conduct on one occasion does not mean that the conduct is welcome on a subsequent occasion. Hostile Environment A \"hostile environment\" exists when sex- based harassment is sufficiently serious to deny or limit a person's ability to participate in or b enefit from the College's programs or activities. A hostile environment can be created by anyone involved in a College's program or activity (e.g., employees, students, campus visitors, etc.). In determining whether sex-based harassment has created a ho stile environment, the College considers the conduct in question from both a subjective and objective perspective. It will be necessary, but not enough, that the conduct was unwelcome to the person who was harassed. But the College will also need to find that a reasonable person in the person's position would have perceived the conduct as undesirable or offensive in order for that conduct to create or contribute to a hostile environment. To make the ultimate determination of whether a hostile environment exists for a person or persons, the College considers a variety of factors related to the severity, persistence or pervasiveness of the sex -based harassment , including: (1) the type, frequency and duration of the conduct; (2) the identity and relationships of persons involved; (3) the number of individuals involved; (4) the location of the conduct and the context in which it occurred; and (5) the degree to which the conduct affected one or more person's education or employment. The more severe the sex -based harassment , the less need there is to show a repetitive series of incidents to find a hostile environment. Indeed, a single instance of sexual assault may be sufficient to create a hostile environment. Likewise, a series of incidents may be sufficient even if the sex -based harassment is not particularly severe. Sexual Harassment by Higher Education Representative What Is Prohibited No higher education representative may make any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors to a student. No higher education representative may exhibit any conduct of a sexual nature toward a student, when such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with the student's educational performance or creating an intimidating, offensive or hostil e educational environment . No higher education representative may exhibit any conduct of a sexual nature toward a student when the higher education representative either explicitly or implicitly makes the student's submission to such conduct a term or con dition of, or uses the student's submission to or rejection of such conduct as a basis for, determining any academic decision . 186 Definitions Higher Education Representative A \"higher education representative\" includes the president, chancellor or other hold er of any executive office on the administrative staff of an institution of higher education, and any member of the faculty of an institution of higher education, including, but not limited to, a dean or associate or assistant dean, a professor or associat e or assistant professor and a full - or part -time instructor or visiting professor, including a graduate assistant or other student who is employed on a temporary basis of less than full -time as a teacher or instructor of any course or program of academic, business or vocational instruction offered by or through an institution of higher education. Unwelcome Conduct is considered \"unwelcome\" if the person did not request or invite it and considered the conduct to be undesirable or offensive. Unwelcome condu ct may take various forms, including name -calling, graphic or written statements (including the use of cell phones or the Internet) or other conduct that may be physically threatening, harmful or humiliating. Unwelcome conduct does not have to include inte nt to harm, be directed at a specific target or involve repeated incidents. Unwelcome conduct can involve persons of the same or opposite sex. Participation in the conduct or the failure to complain does not always mean that the conduct was welcome. The fact that a person may have welcomed some conduct does not necessarily mean that the person welcomed other conduct. Also, the fact that a person requested or invited conduct on one occasion does not mean that the conduct is welcome on a subsequent occasion. Hostile Educational Environment (Applicable to Sexual Harassment by Higher Education Representative) A \"hostile educational environment\" includes conduct which is severe or pervasive and which is objectively and subjectively offensive. Conduct is objec tively offensive if a reasonable person would find such conduct to be egregious. Factors that will be considered when determining if an environment is objectively offensive include the frequency and severity of the conduct, whether it is humiliating or physically threatening and whether it unreasonably interferes with the student's educational performance. Academic Decision An \"academic decision\" includes, but is not limited to: Whether the student will be admitted to an institution of higher education; The educational performance required or expected of the student; The attendance or assignment requirements applicable to the student; The courses, fields of study or programs, including honors and graduate programs, to which the student will be admitted; The placement or course proficiency requirements that are applicable to the student; The quality of instruction the student will receive; The tuition or fee requirements that are applicable to the student; The scholarship opportunities that are available to the student; The extracurricular teams the student will be a member of or the extracurricular competitions in which the student will participate; The grade the student will receive in any examination or in any course or program of instruction in which the student is enrolled; The progress of the student toward successful completion of or graduation from any course or program of instruction in which the student is enrolled; and The degree, if any, the student will receive. 187 Domestic and Dating Violence What Is Prohibited No person shall engage in domestic violence or dating violence against any member of the College community, including students, employees, visitors, volunteers and contractors. Definitions Domestic Violence The term \"domestic violence\" incl udes physical abuse committed by: A current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim; A person with whom the victim shares a child in common; A person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse or intimate partner; A person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or family violence laws of the State of Illinois; or Any other person against an adult or youth victim who is protected from that person's acts under the domestic or family violence laws of the State of Illinois. Dating Violence The term \"dating violence\" includes physical abuse committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim. Physical Abuse \"Physical abuse\" includ es, but is not limited to: Sexual abuse; Knowing or reckless use of physical force, confinement or restraint; Knowing, repeated and unnecessary sleep deprivation; and Knowing or reckless conduct which creates an immediate risk of physical harm. Stalking What Is Prohibited No person shall engage in the stalking of any member of the College community, including students, employees, visitors, volunteers and contractors. Definition Stalking \"Stalking\" is a course of conduct (i.e., a pattern of actions compose d of more than one act over a period of time, however short, evidencing a continuity of conduct) directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to fear for his or her safety or the safety of others or suffer substantial emotional distre ss. Stalking includes any behaviors or activities occurring on more than one occasion that collectively instill fear in a victim and/or threaten her or his safety, mental health or physical health. Such behaviors and activities may include, but are not l imited to, the following: 188 Non-consensual communication, including face -to-face communication, telephone calls, voice messages, e-mails, text messages, written letters, gifts or any other communications that are undesired and place another person in fear; Use of online, electronic or digital technologies, including: o Posting of pictures or information in chat rooms or on Web sites o Sending unwanted/unsolicited email, text messages or talk requests o Posting private or public messages on Internet sites, social ne tworking sites and/or school bulletin boards o Installing spyware on a victim's computer o Using Global Positioning Systems (GPS) to monitor a victim; Pursuing, following, waiting or showing up uninvited at or near a residence, workplace, classroom or other pl aces frequented by the victim; Surveillance or other types of observation including staring, \"peeping\"; Trespassing; Vandalism; Non-consensual touching; Direct verbal or physical threats; Gathering information about an individual from friends, family, and/ or co -workers; Threats to harm self or others, including pets; and Defamation - lying to others about the victim. Retaliation Prohibited The College prohibits retaliation of any kind (including intimidating, threatening, coercing or in any way discrimina ting) against those who file a complaint or third -party report of a violation of this Policy or who otherwise participate in the investigative and/or disciplinary process. The College will take strong responsive action, up to and including expulsion or t ermination of employment, if retaliation occurs. Intimidation Prohibited The College prohibits intimidation of any kind against any member of the College community with the purpose or intent of: preventing that person from reporting a violation of this Policy; causing that person to withdraw a complaint or recant a statement related to the violation of this Policy; or discouraging participation in the College's investigative and/or disciplinary process. The College will take strong responsive action i f such intimidation occurs. \"Prohibited Acts\" Defined Throughout this Policy, all of the underlined acts above shall be referred to as \"Prohibited Acts.\" Note on First Amendment Rights This Policy does not impair the exercise of rights protected under t he First Amendment. The College applies and enforces this Policy in a manner that respects the First Amendment rights of students, employees and others. 189 COMPLAINT AND ADJUDI CATION PROCEDURE A. Right to an Advisor At all times during the complaint, investigat ion and adjudication process, the complainant and respondent each have the right to have an advisor present. This advisor can be anyone of the party's choosing, other than a member of the Title IX Team, who has agreed to serve that function, including an advocate, attorney, friend or family member. However, this advisor may not participate in the College's investigation or adjudication process other than by providing the party with advice and/or support. Reporting Procedures Any member of the College co mmunity who has been a victim of sexual misconduct, domestic or dating violence or stalking has a number of reporting options. Formal Reporting to College Prohibited Acts may be reported to the College by notifying any employee of the College, including t he Title IX Coordinator. Kevin Stephens , the Title IX Coordinator, may be reached by phone at (309) 655- 2291, by email at kevin.n.stephens@osfhealthcare.org , or in person at 511 NE Greenle af Street , Peoria, IL in room 622. All employees of the College are required to notify the Title IX Coordinator of any notice they receive of a Prohibited Act while acting as employees of the College. It should be noted that the College employs health care providers and priests as faculty members. Though discussions with these individuals outside the College, when they are providing health care services or pastoral counseling, may be confidential, any notice they receive of a Prohibited Act while they are acting as employees of the College will be reported to the Title IX Coordinator. All such reports of Prohibited Acts will be investigated by the College as set forth in the \"Investigation Procedures \" on page 191 of this Policy. Formal Reporting to Law Enfor cement Reports to law enforcement may also be made at any time, regardless of whether a report has been made to the College. The Peoria Police Department can be contacted at any time at (309) 673 -4521 (non- emergency) or 911 for emergency. Reports to la w enforcement will not automatically be shared with the College by the police; therefore, if a victim of a Prohibited Act wishes for the College to also investigate the matter, s/he should also make a report to the College. Privileged or Confidential Disclosures The College encourages victims of Prohibited Acts to talk to somebody in order to get the support they need. Regardless of whether a victim wishes to make a report to the College and/or law enforcement, a number of resources are available for confi dential or privileged discussions regarding Prohibited Acts. See \"Reporting and Confidentiality\" on page 196 of this Policy for further information on confidentiality rules with respect to various resources. Third -Party Reporting Anyone can report a Prohibited Act to the College, regardless of whether the person making the complaint was the victim of the Prohibited Act. Third -party reports may be made to any employee of the College, 190 including the Title IX Coordinator. Such reports will be investigated per \"Investigation Procedures\" on page 191 of this Policy. Anonymous Reporting Anyone, including a victim, can make an anonymous report of a Prohibited Act to the College by contacting the Title IX Coordinator and requesting to make an anonymous report. The complainant may request that this report be kept confidential and/or not be investigated by the College. If an individual discloses a Prohibited Act to the College but wishes to maintain confidentiality or requests that no investigation into a parti cular incident be conducted, the College, through the Title IX Coordinator, must weigh that request against the College's obligation to provide a safe, non- discriminatory environment for all students, including the victim. Please see \"Requesting Confiden tiality from the Colleg e\" on page 198 of this handbook for further information on how such a request will be considered. Amnesty Any individual participating in the investigation or adjudication of a complaint involving an alleged Prohibited Act (includ ing the complainant, respondent and witnesses) will be given amnesty from any student conduct policy of the College, including the College's drug and alcohol policy, for all acts discovered during the course of the College's investigation that are material ly relevant to the Prohibited Act being investigated or adjudicated. For example, should the College learn during an investigation into a reported sexual assault that the complainant and respondent were both violating the College's alcohol policies at th e time of the incident, the College will grant amnesty to both complaint and respondent for that particular violation of the alcohol policy. This grant of amnesty is intended to encourage open and honest reporting of information needed for the College to fully and fairly investigate allegations of Prohibited Acts. Interim Safety and Accom modative Measures Once the College has notice of a potential Prohibited Act, it will immediately seek to ensure that the complainant is safe and is being provided the re sources that are needed, regardless of whether the victim wishes to make a formal complaint and/or participate in the College's investigation. The College will remain ever mindful of the victim's well- being and will take ongoing steps to protect the victim from retaliation or harm and work with the victim to create a safety plan. The College will: Assist the victim in accessing available victim advocacy, academic support, counseling, disability, health or mental health services and legal assistance both on and off campus; Provide other security and support, which could include issuing a no- contact order, helping arrange a change of working arrangements or course schedules (including for the alleged perpetrator pending the outcome of an investigation) or a djustments to assignments or tests; and Inform the victim of the right to report a crime to campus or local law enforcement and provide the victim with assistance if the victim wishes to do so. Because the College is under a continuing obligation to addre ss Prohibited Acts campus -wide, reports of Prohibited Acts (including non- identifying reports) will also prompt the College to consider broader remedial action, such as: increased monitoring, supervision or security at specific locations; increased educati on and prevention efforts, including to targeted population groups; conducting climate assessments/victimization surveys; and/or revisiting its policies and practices. 191 Investigation Procedures The College's Title IX Coordinator is responsible for overseei ng the College's response to reports and compl aints of Prohibited Acts. Unless a complainant specifically requests that an investigation not take place, the Title IX Coordinator will order and oversee an investigation into any reports of Prohibited Acts. (For further information on the Title IX Coordinator's role and responsibilities, see \"Title IX Coordinator\" on page 193 of this Policy.) Should the complainant request that no investigation be performed, the Title IX Coordinator will exercise best effor ts to comply with that request; however, should the nature of the facts known suggest an ongoing threat to the complainant or the campus community or otherwise demonstrate a compelling need to proceed with an investigation, the Title IX Coordinator may proceed with an investigation despite the complainant's request to the contrary. Should the complainant wish to make a formal complaint but also request that her/his identity remain confident, the ability of the College to investigate her/his complaint may b e limited. (Please see \"Reporting and Confidentiality\" on page 196 of this Policy for further information.) The Title IX Coordinator will choose an investigator to investigate alleged Prohibited Acts on a case- by-case basis. Any such investigator will be trained and qualified to perform investigations into the specific type of Prohibited Act being alleged and will be neutral and impartial. Investigations will be thorough and prompt. They will likely include interviews with the complainant, respondent and witnesses, and the gathering, review and analysis of relevant evidence. Investigations will be conducted with utmost attention to maintaining the privacy of complainants and respondents. Consistent with the College's mission and values, the complai nant and respondent will be provided equitable rights and will be treated fairly and respectfully throughout the investigation. Both complainant and respondent will receive notice of any formal investigation conducted in order to give both parties the opportunity to offer their accounts, provide names of witnesses and offer any other relevant evidence to the investigator. The College will not hold any hearing or quasi -judicial proceeding on these matters other than the investigation itself. At the conclu sion of the investigation, the investigator will provide a written report to the Title IX Coordinator setting forth her/his findings of fact and an opinion as to whether a Prohibited Act occurred. The investigator will use the preponderance of the evidenc e standard when making findings of fact and determining whether a Prohibited Act occurred. A \"preponderance of the evidence\" means that a particular finding is more likely than not (i.e., is supported by the greater weight of the credible evidence). When weighing the evidence in a sexual misconduct matter, the investigator shall not take into account evidence regarding the complainant's previous sexual behavior with persons other than the respondent if such evidence is presented for the purpose of dispara ging the complainant's character or suggesting that it is more likely than not that the complainant would have consented to the act(s) at issue. Adjudication Procedures Upon receipt of the investigator's report, the Title IX Coordinator will meet with the College's Title IX Team, which will review the report and determine whether to adopt the findings of the investigator. (See \"Title IX Team\" on page 201 of this Policy for further information on the Title IX Team.) Any member of the Title IX Team hav ing a conflict of interest with respect to any party to the complaint that might cause a reasonable person to question her/his objectivity shall recuse her/himself from the adjudication of the particular matter. Neither the parties nor their advisors are entitled to be present during the meetings of the Title IX Team. The Title IX Team will conclude that a Prohibited Act occurred only if it finds that such a conclusion is supported by a preponderance of the evidence. 192 In the event the Title IX Team concl udes that a Prohibited Act occurred, it will determine the appropriate responsive action to be taken, which may include remedies and/or accommodations to the victim, remedies to the College community and sanctions for the person found in violation. Remedi es to the victim may include, but are not limited to: continuation of interim measures, issuance of no- contact orders, allowing a student to withdraw from or retake a class without penalty, providing access to tutoring and providing access to counseling. Remedies to the College community may include, but are not limited to: training and educational programs, and implementation of additional safety or security measures. Sanctions against the respondent may include, but are not limited to: no- contact orders , suspension, expulsion, demotion and termination of employment, as applicable. If the victim wishes, an appropriate responsive action may be mediation between the parties, facilitated by the College. However, mediation is not appropriate and will not be used if there has been a finding of that a sexual assault occurred. The Title IX Coordinator shall provide simultaneous written notice to the complainant and respondent of its conclusions and responsive actions, options and procedures for appeal, any changes to the result and when such results become final. For purposes of this Policy, \"simultaneous\" shall mean as close together in time as reasonably possible without requiring the complainant and respondent to be physically present in the same place a t the same time. The College will not require a party to abide by any nondisclosure agreement, in writing or otherwise, that would prevent the re -disclosure of information related to the outcome of the adjudication. Appeal Procedures Either the complain ant or respondent may appeal the Title IX Team's conclusions, sanctions or other responsive actions to the President of the College in writing within five (5) business days of receiving written notice of those conclusions and responsive actions from the Ti tle IX Coordinator. However, an appeal may only be made on the following grounds: That a member of the Title IX Team had a conflict of interest that should have precluded him/her from participating in the adjudication. That additional relevant information has become available that was not considered by the investigator and/or Title IX Team. That the investigation and/or adjudication procedures set forth in this Policy were not followed by the investigator and/or Title IX Team. Upon receipt of an appeal, the President of the College will either reject or accept the appeal within five (5) business days. The President of the College will use the preponderance of the evidence standard when considering the appeal. Any rejection of an appeal by the President of the College shall be final. In the event the President of the College accepts the appeal, s/he shall send the matter back to the Title IX Team with one of the following instructions: 1) that a member or members of the Title IX Team recuse her/himsel f; 2) that the Title IX Team send the matter back to the investigator for consideration of additional evidence; or 3) that the Title IX Team and/or investigator comply with the investigation and/or adjudication procedures set forth in this Policy, specifyi ng what procedures have not been properly followed, and reconsider the matter using the proper procedures. 193 Timeframe The College will strive to resolve any matter falling under this Policy within sixty (60) days of receiving notice of a Prohibited Act, including investigation, adjudication and appeal. OPTIONS FOR ASSISTAN CE A. Options for Assistan ce Following a Sexual Assault or Other Prohibited Act The College is committed to providing assistance to any member of the College community who is a victim of sexual misconduct or other Prohibited Act. What to Do If You Are the Victim of Sexual Assault In the immediate aftermath of a sexual assault, the most important thing is for the victim to get to a safe place. Whether it be the victim's home, a friend's ho me or with a family member, immediate safety is what matters most. When a feeling of safety has been achieved, it is vital for the victim to receive medical attention, and strongly recommended for the victim to receive a forensic examination. DNA evidence is an integral part of a law enforcement investigation that can build a strong case to show that a sexual assault occurred and to show that the defendant is the source of any biological material left on the victim's body. Victims should make every effort to save anything that might contain the perpetrator's DNA and should not: Bathe or shower; Use the restroom; Change clothes; Comb hair; Clean up the crime scene; or Move anything the perpetrator may have touched. Even if the victim has not yet decided to report the crime, receiving a forensic medical exam and keeping the evidence safe from damage will improve the chances that the police can access and test the stored evidence at a later date. Resources for I mmediate Assistan ce The resources below are avai lable to anyone who has been the victim of sexual assault or any other Prohibited Act. Title IX Coordinator At the College, the Title IX Coordinator, Kevin Stephens , can be contacted at (309) 655- 2291 at any time to assist a victim in connecting with tra ined advocates and counselors who can provide an immediate response in a crisis situation, regardless of whether the victim wishes to make an official report or participate in the institutional disciplinary or criminal process.

Talking a bout What Happened The College encourages victims of sexual assault and other Prohibited Acts to talk to somebody in order to can get the support they need, and so the College can respond appropriately. This Policy is intended to make the College community aware of the various reporting and confidential disclosure options available - so individuals can make informed choices about where to turn should they become a victim of a Prohibited Act. The College encourages victims to talk to someone identified in one or more of these groups. The Options Privileged and Confidential Communications Victims who wish to speak with someone in confidence without triggering an investigation by the College have several options. Professional Counselors Professional, licensed counselors who provide mental health counseling (including those who act in that role under the supervision of a licensed counselor) will not report any information about an incident to the College without a victim's permission. Following is the contact in formation for these individuals provided by the College at no charge to the victim: OSF HealthCare Employee Assistance Program (800) 433- 7916 (This service is available to students as well as employees of the College.) Off-Campus Counselors and Advocates Off-campus counselors, advocates and health care providers will also generally maintain confidentiality and not share information with the College unless the victim requests the disclosure and signs a consent or waiver form. Following is contact informati on for such off -campus resources: Center for Prevention of Abuse (sexual assault resources) (309) 691- 0551 720 Joan Court Peoria, IL www.centerforpreventionofabuse.org 197 Agape Counseling (309) 692- 4433 2001 West Willow Knolls Drive, Peoria, IL 61614 www.agapecounselors.net Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence Illinois Domestic Violence Coalition National Sexual Assault Hotline: 800 -656-HOPE (4673) Illinois Domestic Violence Help Line (877) 863- 6338 Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN) (800) 656- HOPE www.rainn.org Exceptions to Confidentiality While professional and non- professional counselors and advocates may maintain a victim's confidentiality with respect to the College, they may have reporting or other obligations under state law. Examples of such instances under Illinois law include the following: Physicians, nurses and/or medical facility administrators are required to noti fy local law enforcement when an individual who is not accompanied by a law enforcement official requests treatment at a medical facility and reasonably appears to be the victim of a crime; and Physicians, clinical psychologists, and other qualified exami ners must report to the Illinois Department of Human Services any person who is determined to pose a clear and present danger to himself, herself or others. Other categories of individuals, including therapists, are legally permitted to disclose information when they determine such disclosure to be necessary in order to protect against an imminent risk of injury to self or others. Such disclosure may include disclosure to law enforcement. Communications Which Are Not Privileged or Confidential Reporting to a College Employee When a victim tells a College employee about a Prohibited Act, the victim can expect the College to take immediate and appropriate steps to investigate what happened and to resolve the matter promptly and equitably. A College employe e must report to the Title IX Coordinator all relevant details about the incident shared by the victim that the College will need to determine what happened - including the names of the victim and alleged perpetrator(s), any witnesses and any other relevan t facts, including the date, time and specific location of the alleged incident. To the extent possible, information reported to a College employee will be shared only with people responsible for handling the College's response to the report. A College em ployee should not share information with law enforcement without the victim's consent or unless the victim has also reported the incident to law enforcement. 198 Before a victim reveals any information to a College employee, the employee should try to ensure t hat the victim understands the employee's reporting obligations - and, if the victim wants to maintain confidentiality, direct the victim to confidential resources. If the victim wants to tell the College employee what happened but also maintain confidenti ality, the employee should tell the victim that the College will consider the request, but cannot guarantee that the College will be able to honor it. In reporting the details of the incident to the Title IX Coordinator, the employee will also inform the Coordinator of the victim's request for confidentiality. College employees will not pressure a victim to request confidentiality, but will honor and support the victim's wishes, including for the College to fully investigate an incident. By the same token , College employees will not pressure a victim to make a full report if the victim is not ready or does not wish to do so. Requesting Confidentiality from the College If a victim discloses an incident to a College employee but wishes to maintain confidenti ality or requests that no investigation into a particular incident be conducted or disciplinary action taken, the College, through the Title IX Coordinator, must weigh that request against the College's obligation to provide a safe, non - discriminatory envi ronment for all students, including the victim. (For further information on how the decision to investigate is made, see \"Investigation Procedures\" on page 191 of this Policy.) If the College honors the request for confidentiality, a victim must underst and that the College's ability to meaningfully investigate the incident and pursue disciplinary action against the alleged perpetrator(s) may be limited. Although rare, there are times when the College may not be able to honor a victim's request for confidentiality in order to provide a safe, non- discriminatory environment for all students. The College's Title IX Coordinator will evaluate requests for confidentiality once an employee is on notice of alleged Prohibited Act. When weighing a victim's request for confidentiality or request that no investigation or discipline be pursued, the Title IX Coordinator will consider a range of factors, including the following: The increased risk that the alleged perpetrator will commit additional acts of misconduct or violence, such as: whether there have been other complaints about the same alleged perpetrator whether the alleged perpetrator has a history of arrests or records from a prior school indicating a history of violence whether the alleged perpetrator threatened further sexual violence or other violence against the victim or others whether sexual violence was committed by multiple perpetrators; whether sexual or other violence was perpetrated with a weapon; whether the victim is a minor; whether the College possesses other means to obtain relevant evidence (e.g., security cameras or personnel, physical evidence); and whether the victim's report reveals a pattern of perpetration (e.g., via illicit use of drugs or alcohol) at a given location or by a particular g roup. The presence of one or more of these factors could lead the College to investigate and, if appropriate, pursue disciplinary action. If none of these factors is present, the College will likely respect the victim's request for confidentiality. If the College determines that it cannot maintain a victim's confidentiality, the College will inform the victim prior to starting an investigation and will, to the extent possible, only share information with people responsible for handling the College's respo nse. The College will not require a victim to participate in any investigation or disciplinary proceeding if the victim does not wish to do so. 199 If the College determines that it can respect a victim's request for confidentiality, the College will also tak e immediate action as necessary to protect and assist the victim. Miscellaneous Take Back the Night and Other Public Awareness Events Public awareness events such as \"Take Back the Night,\" the Clothesline Project, candlelight vigils, protests, \"survivor sp eak outs\" or other forums in which students disclose incidents of sexual violence are not considered notice to the College of sexual violence for purposes of triggering its obligation to investigate any particular incident(s). Such events may, however, re veal the need for campus- wide education and prevention efforts, and the College will provide information about students' Title IX rights at these events. Clery Act Reporting Certain campus officials have a duty to report sexual misconduct and certain other Prohibited Acts for federal statistical reporting purposes under the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (the \"Clery Act\"). All personally -identifiable information is kept confidential - neither the identity of the victim or offender are ever revealed in the College's annual Campus Security Report - but statistical information regarding the type, date and general location of the incident (i.e., on- campus, off - campus, etc.) may be published. This report helps to provide the community with a clear picture of the extent and nature of campus crime, to ensure greater community safety. Emergency Notifications and Timely Warnings Victims of sexual misconduct and certain other Prohibited Acts should also be aware tha t College administrators must issue immediate timely warnings for incidents reported to them that are confirmed to pose a substantial threat of bodily harm or danger to members of the campus community. The College will ensure that a victim's name and other identifying information is not disclosed, while still providing enough information for community members to make safety decisions in light of the danger. When it has been determined that a crime creates a threat of continuing danger to the campus community, a crime alert will be posted throughout the campus, and an e -mail will be sent to the campus community. Kevin Stephens, Assistant Dean Support Services, will be responsible for issuing the timely warnings. TITLE IX COORDINATOR A. Role of the Title IX Co ordinator Pursuant to federal law1, the College's Title IX Coordinator has primary responsibility for coordinating the College's efforts to comply with and carry out its responsibilities under Title IX, which prohibits sex discrimination in all the operations of this College, as well as retaliation for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by Title IX. Sexual misconduct against students, including sexual harassment, sexual assault and sexual exploitation, can be a form of sex discri mination under Title IX, as can domestic or dating violence or stalking. The Title IX coordinator oversees the College's response to reports and complaints that involve possible sex discrimination to monitor outcomes, identify and address any patterns, and assess effects on the campus climate, so the College can address issues that affect the wider school community. A member of the College community should contact the Title IX Coordinator in order to: Seek information or training about individuals' rights a nd courses of action available to resolve reports or complaints that involve potential sex discrimination, including Prohibited Acts; 1 See Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and the U.S. Department of Education's implementing regulations at 34 C.F.R. Part 106. 200 File a complaint or make a report of sex discrimination, including Prohibited Acts; Notify the College of an incident or p olicy or procedure that may raise potential Title IX concerns; Get information about available resources (including confidential resources) and support services relating to sex discrimination, including Prohibited Acts; and Ask questions about the College' s policies and procedures related to sex discrimination, including this Policy. Functions and Responsibilities of the Title IX Coordinator The Title IX Coordinator's functions and responsibilities include the following: Training for Students and Employees The Title IX Coordinator provides or facilitates ongoing training, consultation and technical assistance on Title IX for all students and employees, including: Regular training for employees outlining their rights and obligations under Title IX, including the appropriate response to reports of sexual misconduct, the obligation to report sexual misconduct to appropriate College officials and the extent to which counselors and advocates may keep a report confidential; and Regular training for students outlining their rights under Title IX; with regard to sexual misconduct, this training will include: what constitutes sexual misconduct and when it creates a hostile environment, the definition of consent, reporting options (including reports to employees, campus and local law enforcement, and confidential reporting to counselors or advocates), the grievance procedures used to process complaints, applicable disciplinary code provisions relating to sexual misconduct and the consequences of violating those provisions, the role of alcohol and drugs in sexual misconduct, the effects of trauma, strategies and skills for bystander intervention, the offices or individuals with whom students can speak confidentially, the offices or individuals who can provide support serv ices, the employees who must report incidents to the Title IX coordinator and Title IX's protections against retaliation. Investigations The College is responsible for conducting adequate, reliable and impartial investigations of reports and complaints of sexual misconduct. The Title IX Coordinator oversees many aspects of this response, including: Determining whether the report or complaint alleges conduct that may, upon investigation, constitute a Prohibited Act; Appointing an investigative team upon su ch determination; Making certain that individual reports and complaints are handled properly and in a prompt and timely manner; Informing all parties regarding the grievance process; Confirming that all parties have been notified of grievance decisions and of the right to, and procedures for, appeal, if applicable; Maintaining information and documentation related to the investigation in a secure manner; and Monitoring compliance with timeframes specified in the grievance procedures. The Title IX Coordina tor also evaluates requests for confidentiality by those who report or complain about a Prohibited Act in the context of the College's responsibility to provide a safe and nondiscriminatory environment for all students. 201 Remedies, Including Interim Measures Upon learning of a report or complaint of a Prohibited Act, the Title IX Coordinator will promptly take steps to ensure the complainant's equal access to the College's programs and activities and to protect the complainant, as necessary. Such steps inc lude taking interim measures before the final outcome of any investigation, providing remedial measures after the final outcome of investigation and making the complainant aware of all available resources, including victim advocacy, academic support, counseling, disability services, health and mental health services, and legal assistance. Upon a finding that a Prohibited Act occurred, the Title IX Coordinator determines whether campus -wide remedies should be adopted in response, including review and revisio n of the College's policies, increased monitoring, supervision or security at specific locations, and increased education and prevention efforts. If the Title IX Team finds that an individual engaged in a Prohibited Act, the Title IX Coordinator reviews proposed sanctions before they are imposed to ensure that they, along with the College's interim and long - term measures taken in response to the sexual misconduct, are reasonably calculated to stop the sexual misconduct and prevent its recurrence. Monitoring and Advising In order to address sexual misconduct on campus and ensure ongoing compliance with Title IX, the Title IX Coordinator: Coordinates campus climate surveys; Analyzes data collected by any climate surveys to assess the rates and nature of sexual misconduct, any location hot -spots or risk factors; knowledge of the College's sexual misconduct policies, procedures and resources and the consequences of violating such policies; and the effectiveness of the College's efforts to ensure that the College is free from sexual misconduct; Reviews regularly all reports and complaints raising potential Title IX issues throughout the College to ensure that the College responded consistent with its Title IX obligations, even if the report or complaint was initially filed or raised with another individual; Reviews regularly all reports and complaints raising potential Title IX issues throughout the College to identify and address any patterns; Reviews regularly the College's policies and procedures to ensure that t hey comply with the requirements of Title IX; Organizes and maintains files related to grievances, reports, complaints and other records of potential sex discrimination, including sexual misconduct, in a secure manner; Assesses regularly the College's comp liance with, and the effectiveness of, policies and procedures related to sex discrimination, including sexual misconduct, and recommends modifications where appropriate; Consults regularly with the President of the College and campus stakeholders to promote campus -wide awareness and discussion of Title IX -related issues, and develop and implement any modifications of policies and procedures to prevent and eliminate sex discrimination, including sexual misconduct; and Ensures that appropriate policies and p rocedures are in place for working with local law enforcement and coordinating with local victim advocacy organizations and service providers, including rape crisis centers.
