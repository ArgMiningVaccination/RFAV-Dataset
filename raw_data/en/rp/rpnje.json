Smuggled mig rants are vulnerable to exploita tion and their liv es are often put a t r isk:thousands of people ha ve suffoca ted in container s,per ished in deser ts or dro wned a t sea while being smuggled to another countr y.The smuggling of mig rants and the activities rela ted to it genera te enor mous profits for the cr iminals in volved and fuel cor ruption and organized cr ime. The Conference of the P arties to the United Na tions Con vention against T ransnational Organ - ized Cr ime in its decision 4/5 on the implementa tion of the Protocol against the Smuggling of Mig rants by Land, Sea and Air,supplementing the United Na tions Con vention against T ransnational Organized Cr ime,w elcomed the effor under taken to pro vide guidance and infor mation on best practices in the areas of training and capacity-b uilding, as w ell as a ware- ness-raising stra tegies to prev ent and comba t the smuggling of mig rants. The T oolkit is an example of such effor ts. The Smuggling of Mig rants Protocol sets out three clear goals: Prev enting and comba ting the smuggling of mig rants Protecting the r ights of smuggled mig rants Promoting coopera tion among Sta tes par ties to those ends The goals of this T oolkit are the same. The promising practices and recommended resources included in it are by no means an exhaustiv e collection of successful, crea tive and inno vative responses to addressing the smuggling of mig rants. Ho wever, they pro vide examples of such initia tives and demonstra te the range of resources a vailable to those in volved in effor ts to counter the smuggling of mig rants. The T oolkit is intended to pro vide guidance, sho wcase promising practices and recommend resources in thema tic areas . It is hoped tha t the T oolkit will inspire and help polic ymakers, la w enforcement officer s,judges, prosecutor s,victim ser vice pro viders and member s of civil society to pla y their par t in the global effor t to comba t the smuggling of mig rants. ivHow to use the Toolkit TheT oolkit is intended to assist those w orking to prev ent and comba t the smuggling of mig rants.

The movement ofpeople worldwide hasresulted inmany stories that have contributed tothe ofhumanity. People have moved allover theglobe foravariety ofreasons: to ofthis ofmigrants undermines thecapacity ofStates tosafeguard their own sovereignty and thereby reduces theopportunities available tomigrants to move toother countries legally and safely. The cost ofthesmuggling ofmigrants isoften measurable interms oflives lost. Positive links between migration and development The money thatmigrants send home tofamily andfriends indeveloping countries billion in2005. This money isused primarily topurchase consumer goods, stimulate local economies and help start small businesses, and thisgenerally hasamultiplier effect onnational incomes. Through thereceipt ofremittances, many poor people canhave access forthefirst time to financial services, such asthose offered bybanks, credit unions and microfinance institutions. The report ontherelationship isapowerful driver of international migration. The attraction hasintensified asincome differentials among countries continue togrow. This holds true notonly regarding thelarge andgrowing differentials between high- and low-income countries, butalso with regard tothe more dynamic andthelessdynamic developing countries. \"51. Many advanced anddynamic economies need migrant workers tofilljobs that cannot beoutsourced andthatdonotfindlocal willing low-skilled workers inadvanced economies, many ofwhom arethemselves migrants who arrived inearlier waves. However, most migrants complement theskills ofdomestic workers instead ofcompeting with them. Byperforming tasks that either would goundone orcost more, migrants allow citizens toperform other, more productive andbetter- paid jobs.They alsomaintain viable economic Byenlarging thelabour force and thepool ofconsumers and by contributing their entrepreneurial capacities, migrants boost economic growth in receiving countries. \"53.Atthepoint oforigin, deeper poverty does notlead automatically tohigher migration. The people generally donothave theresources tobear thecosts and risks ofinternational migration. International migrants areusually drawn from middle-income households. However, when migrants establish themselves abroad, they help friends and relatives tofollow and,intheprocess, thecosts and risks both oforigin andofdestination. Itspotential benefits arelarger than the potential gains from freer international trade, particularly fordeveloping countries.\" Negative links between migration and development \"17.The experience ofmigration hasalso evolved insome less positive ways.

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) notes thatinmore than 40countries around theworld, violent conflict hastorn farmland, andcities. Throughout theworld today, there aresome 35million survivors ofconflict\u201410 million refugees and 25million internally displaced persons. Conflict hasdestroyed homes and livelihoods in countless communities; individuals have been exposed tosexual violence and maimed, tortured andkilled. Another cause ofdisplacement leading tomigration isnatural disaster. Droughts, cyclones, floods andmudslides cause unimaginable devastation. In2008 alone, more than 300disasters killed more than 235,000 people, affected more than 200 million others andcaused losses anddamage worth $181 billion. Disasters take anenormous tollnotonly onlives, butalso onlivelihoods, homes, basic social services and community infrastructure. Moreover, such destruction typically hasadisproportionate impact onthepoorest and most vulnerable populations, including women, children, youth andtheelderly. Anexamination oftheproblems thattheMillennium Development Goals setouttoaddress offers insight into theroot causes ofmigration. Goal 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger TheWorld Bank's latest estimates show that1.4billion people indeveloping countries were poverty absolute poverty.

The fact that 1.4billion people indeveloping countries areliving in extreme poverty (according to2005 World Bank statistics) highlights thefactthat formany people, health care may notbeaffordable andwhen they liveinremote areas, may notbe physically accessible. Further, thehealth-care services thatareavailable (where affordable and accessible) may notbeadequate health-care This thesignificant movement ofhealth-care workers toplaces where there arebetter working inrespect practitioners that they have left,which hasinturn exacerbated thehealth-care crisis asadriving force of migration. Such health-care issues arenever more evident than inthecontext ofHIV/AIDS, they willhave access toadequate health care.The stigmatization that many people living with HIV orAIDS orboth isanother influential Loss ofhousehold income through thedeath ordisability ofaformer migrant worker promotes migration, astheir families must seek other means toearn anincome.

Vulnerability of mobile populations to HIV/AIDS People who have already begun tomigrate can beparticularly vulnerable tocontracting HIV/AIDS, depending which migration istiedtothespread ofHIV/AIDS: Migrants' multi-local social networks create opportunities for wider sexual networking Mobility andtransience canencourage ormake people vulnerable tohigh-risk sexual behaviour Mobility makes people more difficult toreach through interventions (preventative education, condom provision, HIV testing and counselling, post-infection treatment andcare) Migrant communities areoften socially, economically in terms both oflegal rights andprotection andofdiscrimination andxenophobia.

With businesses closing down, employers requesting fewer foreign workers andGovernments halting therecruitment ofnew foreign labour, many people willtake and anincreased demand forcheaper goods and services isputting pressure ontheprotectionist environment, leading togreater vulnerability toexploitation of both regular and irregular migrants. Additional vulnerability may arise owing toincreased competition with national workers forscarce jobs anddiminished investments incommunity welfare. National workers may benefit from more support than foreign workers. Even under difficult conditions, however, therights ofsmuggled migrants andofthevictims oftrafficking inpersons that candidates formigration\u2014be itlegal orillegal\u2014are likely topostpone their migration decisions, while those already present inacountry\u2014whether legally orillegally\u2014may stay there waiting for thecrisis topass.Others note that nomass returns ofmigrant workers have been observed, butnew outflows from some countries oforigin have slowed characteristic, 22 TOOLKIT TOCOMBAT initsability totrack andrespond tothechanged tactics oftraffickers.

Inother situations, thesmuggler controls every aspect ofthesmuggling process, destination ortoreturn home. situations, themigrant andthesmuggler willnegotiate extensively over matters oftravel anddestination. Vulnerability of migrants to smugglers of migrants Many migrants intend tomigrate independently ofsmugglers ofmigrants. However, as circumventing therestrictions onmovement becomes more challenging andasenvironments inthecourse ofthejourney become more unfamiliar, migrants may resort totheservices of smugglers ofmigrants. The more amigrant feels displaced (for example, notknowing enroute), thegreater willbe. Recommended resources Heckman, Friedrich. T owards a better understanding of human smuggling.

Evidence showed that thetraffickers placed advertisements innewspapers forworkers needed to pick tomatoes. Persons providing information onworking conditions and departure dates over the phone introduced themselves using false personal data. Phone numbers featured injoboffers were changed frequently. The charge forthejourney was about \u20ac150; workers were charged another \u20ac150 upon arrival. Transport was provided byprivate companies aswell asbyindividual carriers. Recruited workers were transported directly toplantations, where work organization and supervision were inthehands ofpeople ofthesame nationality astheworkers, aswell asother nationalities. Workers and subjected tophysical and psychological violence. Inorder toprevent them from contacting anyone ontheoutside, during theworking day they were surveyed byguards and atnight they were locked inthepremises where they slept; inmany cases, their mobile phones and documents were taken away. One ofthemethods used toforce thepeople recruited towork was tocharge them during the first few weeks oftheir stay abroad, with excessive fees for, inter alia, accommodation and electricity and forgoing shopping. The charges were sohigh and theearnings solow that the victims didnot manage tocover the alleged debt, even after afew months. The work kept increasing. Thevictims were accommodated inpremises completely unfit forhumans, mainly ruined buildings with nowater, electricity orfurnishings; in many cases, victims were forced toliveintents.

Small- scale smugglers generally arrange allaspects ofthesmuggling operation themselves rather than employing other actors intheprocess. Within larger smuggling networks, there isaclear division ofwork among theactors involved. Individuals who head smuggling networks areoften theactors most difficult toidentify and bring tojustice. Unless their activities arestopped, the smuggling ofmigrants will continue. oftheroles played byactors much likethemanager employ orsubcon- tract other individuals participating intheoperation. The coordinator/organizer oversees the whole process against coordinators/organizers. They often have \"employees\" who amore contact between smugglers andprospective migrants seeking ways tomigrate. Recruiters often lure such persons into illegal migration bydeliberately misinforming them about both themigration process andconditions inthe destination They prey onvulnerable persons canbefound.4 TOOLKIT TOCOMBAT SMUGGLING OFMIGRANTS Relationships Recruiters often collaborate Inmany they areresident inthecountry oforigin ortransit, language know themigrants personally.

Detectives found dry embossing stamps bearing official passport crests ready to be placed on the front covers of the counterfeit passports. A thorough search of the premises revealed two safes containing numerous documents and on open display were in excess of 300 blank Spanish, Italian and Portuguese passports and 400 blank Portuguese identity cards. t here was evidence that numerous false documents, including utility bills, had been made and sold, and that orders were being prepared, with numerous passport 20 TOOLKIT TOCOMBAT SMUGGLING OFMIGRANTS photographs awaiting use.

There isnocomprehensive, universally accepted definition ofcorruption. Attempts todevelop such adefinition invariably meet with legal, criminological and,inmany countries, political problems. The United Nations Convention against Corruption, rather than defining thephenomenon, provides forawide range ofacts toestablish those civil The Convention addresses, inter alia, preventive measures, criminalization, lawenforcement, international cooperation andrecovery ofassets obtained astheabuse canalsobeunderstood Active orpassive bribery Trading ininfluence Breach oftrust Accounting offences. Corruption in the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the United Nations Convention against Corruption The United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime covers many substantive andprocedural issues relating tocorruption. Many ofitsprovisions uselanguage identical tothatoftheUnited against differences between thetwoinstruments: Criminalization articles 15and16oftheUnited Nations Convention against Corruption and article 8oftheUnited Nations Convention against Trans national Organized Crime Criminalization ofobstruction ofjustice: article 23oftheUnited Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and article 25ofthe United Nations Convention against Corruption23 TOOL 2:ACTORS AND PROCESSES INTHE SMUGGLING OFMIGRANTS Criminalization ofmoney-laundering: article 23oftheUnited Nations Convention against Corruption and article 6ofthe United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.

Nafi was waiting forhim. Nafi explained that ontheflight from Karachi with Suleiman there had been another 50illegal immi- grants, their journey organized byseveral other agents inPakistan.

Presentation delivered attheMobility, Ethnicity and Society Conference, University ofBristol, 16-17 March 200625 TOOL 2:ACTORS AND PROCESSES INTHE SMUGGLING How does corruption harm societies? Corruption isaserious crime thatweakens societies, inter alia,by: Hindering social and economic development and increasing poverty bydiverting domestic andforeign investment away from where itismost needed Weakening education andhealth systems, thus depriving people ofthebasic building blocks ofadecent life Undermining democracy bydistorting electoral processes and also undermining government institutions, thus potentially leading topolitical instability Exacerbating inequality and injustice byperverting therule oflawand punishing victims ofcrime through corrupt rulings. Promising practices Strategies against corruption The Council ofEurope Programme against Corruption and Organised Crime inSouth- Eastern Europe suggests various strategies units Organization ofmulti-agency training Prevention: codes guidelines, governing atrisk Targeting ofofficials susceptible tocorruption More systematic useofinformation provided bymigrants andbynon-governmental andcivil society organizations Engagement ofnon-governmental organizations community monitoring investigations Organization ofawareness campaigns ofinternational systems Organization ofregional networks Seeking oftechnical assistance from international organizations andbilateral donors. What can States and individuals do to fight corruption? Say\"No\" tocorruption. 26 Ratify andenact theUnited Nations Convention against Corruption. Countries that successfully tackle corruption are far more legitimate in the eyes of their citizens, thus creating stability and trust. Know what theConvention requires ofyour Government anditsofficials. Rooting out corruption facilitates social and economic development. Educate thepublic about theGovernment's responsibility tobecorruption-free. Equitable and fair justice for all is crucial to a country's stability and growth. It also helps to fight crime effectively. Raise awareness among thepublic, themedia and Governments about thecost of corruption tokeyservices such ashealth andeducation. Society as a whole benefits from basic services that function effectively. Educate theyouth ofyour country about what ethical behaviour andcorruption are and how tofight corruption, and encourage them todemand their right tosuch information. One of the ways to ensure a brighter future is to ensure that future generations of citizens are brought up to expect corruption-free countries. Report incidents ofcorruption. Create an environment in which the rule of law prevails. Refuse toparticipate inanyactivities thatarenotlegal andtransparent. A corruption- free business environment encourages both domestic and foreign investment. Foster economic stability byenforcing policies ofzero tolerance towards corruption. A transparent and open business community is the cornerstone of any strong democracy. Recommended resources Anti-Slavery International, Transparency International andtheUnited Nations Office onCrime.

I do not know, somewhere where I can stay.OK,atthemoment wecanoffer you North America orone atourexpense. How much does it cost and how long do I have to wait? The fee to North America is $10,000 and we can arrange everything within two or three weeks. ForoneoftheWestern European countries, thefeeis$8,000; thiswillalsotake two orthree weeks.

The second step isthedesert crossing itself, which isvery difficult anddangerous. Atthis stage, almost allmigrants must establish contact with middlemen inorder tocontinue the journey with drivers who know theroutes in which aretransported forseveral days, usually several hubs. often speak oftheir journey as themost dangerous part oftheir thetravellers Migrants areoften leftoutside hubs bysmugglers who fear detection. Migrants travelling without smugglers may hide forseveral days while looking forsmugglers totake them to their desired destination; thewaiting time canbevery long. They may beintroduced to smugglers bydrivers who brought them tothehub ormay find smugglers without help.If they need tosave money tofinance their onward travel, they may remain atthehub for several months, oreven years. Migrants often lodge ingroups with fellow nationals who arealready integrated intothelocal community and who may beable affinities and areoften controlled byagroup leader who forbids newcomers from having contact with persons outside thegroup. Insome cases, migrants liveincamps ofseveral hundred people, where they lack facilities andresources andthethreat ofviolence from criminal organizations themigrants have nochoice in that across thedesert, ajourney that around 10days.

As the boat moved off, we began singing gospel music to keep our spirits up. It helped us not to think about the danger. After many hours, lots of us, including me, were vomiting. One girl who had been vomiting severely died. I can't say what happened to her body. I try never to think about it. \"After many hours of this, a big wave came and covered the boat. Everyone was shouting, water was pouring into the boat. I thought we were dead. W e were all crying, we had no idea which direction we were going in or which direction we had come from. Everyone was panicking but then the engine suddenly started again. W e all worked hard to bail out the water and we continued the journey. W e were at sea for another three or four hours. I remember thinking it felt like the ocean kept opening up, swallowing our boat and spitting it back out again. W e were rescued by the police as we neared the coastline. Moments after they picked us all up, our boat broke in two. If we had not been rescued, we would certainly have died at sea. The other two boats disappeared. T o this day I don't know what happened to them. \" Morgan, a survivor of smuggling by sea Source: BBC, 12September 2006. One ofthemost dangerous 61,413 migrants.2 2International 3February 2009.

These instruments also provide aframework forStates tocollaborate with each other toprevent smuggling ofmigrants takes place across borders and cannot beaddressed without joint international efforts andinternational cooperation. Agrowing number ofbilateral, regional and global agreements reflect the increasing recognition thattransnational crime must beaddressed through international cooperation. As criminal groups operate across borders, judicial systems must dothesame. The most relevant international instruments with regard tocombating thesmuggling of migrants are: The United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (Organized Crime Convention) The Protocol toPrevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking inPersons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (Trafficking inPersons Protocol) The Protocol against theSmuggling ofMigrants byLand, SeaandAir,supplementing theUnited Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (Smuggling ofMigrants Protocol) States that areserious about Trafficking inPersons Protocol andtheSmuggling ofMigrants Protocol. Organized Crime Convention The Organized Crime Convention establishes general measures against transnational organized crime, while itsProtocols focus onspecific crimes. Each Protocol must beread asthecase established bytheProtocols arealso considered offences under theConvention itself. The Organized Crime Convention andtheProtocols thereto establish minimum standards; States parties arebound standards, butmay adopt stricter measures.3 tOOl 3:InteRnatIOnal legal fRaMewORk The Organized Crime Convention andtheSmuggling ofMigrants Protocol enable States to tackle thecrime ofthesmuggling ofmigrants inacomprehensive manner. This isimportant because smuggling operations areoften only one part ofcriminal activities. The groups involved inthesmuggling ofmigrants also tend toengage inother illicit activities, such as trafficking inpersons, drugs, weapons orother illicit commodities, corruption, or money-laundering. The Organized Crime Convention facilitates theinvestigation and prosecution ofallthese criminal activities inacomprehensive, cross-border global approach. Itspurpose istopromote cooperation Itseeks toincrease thenumber ofStates thattake effective measures against and strengthen international cooperation. Itrespects thedifferences and specificities toremove some oftheexisting barriers toeffective transnational collaboration. The Convention covers offences that form part oftheprofit-making activities oforganized criminal groups; itssupplementary Protocols target specific types oforganized criminal activity that require specialized provisions. Smuggling of Migrants Protocol The Smuggling ofMigrants Protocol hasthree purposes, which aresetoutinitsarticle 2: Inaddition forms ofinternational cooperation, theConvention andthetwoProtocols setstandards on both substantive and procedural lawinorder toassist States parties inharmonizing their legislation and eliminating differences that canhamper prompt and effective international cooperation.

Article 1oftheSmuggling ofMigrants Protocol and article 37oftheOrganized Crime Convention establish thefollowing basic principles governing therelationship between the twoinstruments: No State can be a party to the Protocol unless it is also a party to the Convention Simultaneous ratification oraccession ispermitted, butaState totheobligations ofthe Convention. The Convention and the Protocol must be interpreted together Ininterpreting thevarious instruments, allrelevant instruments should beconsidered and provisions using similar orparallel language should begiven generally similar meaning. Ininterpreting aProtocol, thepurpose must alsobeconsidered, which may modify insome cases. The provisions ofaparticular Protocol arebinding onStates parties only ifthey are parties tothat Protocol. The provisions of the Convention apply to the Protocol, mutatis mutandis Inapplying provisions oftheConvention that arise under theProtocol, butmodifications should notbemade unless required, and then only totheextent necessary. This general rule does notapply where aProtocol specifically excludes it. Offences established under the Protocol will also be regarded as offences established in accordance with the Convention This principle, which iscomparable incertain respects tothemutatis mutandis require- ment, isacritical within thescope ofthebasic Convention provisions governing forms ofinternational cooperation, such asextradition (article 16ofthe Convention) andmutual legal assistance (article 18oftheConvention). This principle also links theProtocol and Convention bymaking other mandatory provisions oftheConvention applicable articles 12to14(confiscation), article 15(jurisdiction), article 16 (extradition), article 18(mutual legal assistance), article 20(special investigative techniques), article 27(law enforcement cooperation), articles 29and 30(training, technical assistance and economic development) and article 34 (implementation oftheConvention) apply equally totheoffences established under element ofdomestic legislation toimplement theProtocol.

National governmental ornon-governmental actors should initiate assessments and conduct them jointly with local Government and civil society actors. National authorities should also draw upon theexpertise ofresearch institutes. External actors canfacilitate assessments, asthey may besensitive tolocal economic, social, cultural, civil andpolitical circumstances. Findings should beopenly shared with stakeholders fordiscussion. Clear frameworks and questionnaires should bedeveloped before information is gathered. Needs assessments should begin atthemost basic level toconsider such issues as: The extent towhich Government agencies and non-governmental organizations are initiated tobuild cooperation between Government agencies andnon-governmental organizations The extent towhich theGovernment ismaking funds available tocombat smuggling ofmigrants andassist smuggled migrants who may bevictims ofcrime Initial consultations with Government andnon-governmental agencies should thecountry perceives forDemocratic Institutions andHuman Rights.

This is followed by a preparatory desk review, an analysis of the relevant stakeholders and the identification of a contact point in the State in question. The following factors need to be determined: The number ofstakeholders tobeinterviewed bytheassessor The number ofassessment missions totheState inquestion The timeframe oftheoverall project Preparatory desk review The preparatory desk review will be carried out by the assessor prior to the assessment missions. During this phase, existing data and information on the State in question will be evaluated in accordance with the overall purpose of the project. In order to come to reliable conclusions during an assessment, the quality and reliability of the information has to be analysed. While media and anecdotal reports should be taken into account during the assessment process, they should not be used in place of quantitative and qualitative data from reliable sources. Below are examples of the types of questions that need to be asked when carrying out a needs assessment of criminal justice capacities to combat the smuggling of migrants. National actors Which Government offices andnational institutions deal with illegal migration? -What aretheir CoMBA tSMUGGlING oF MIGRANtS Which Government offices andnational institutions (including ministries, intelligence services, border guards, police, prosecution andthejudiciary) deal with thesmuggling -What aretheir respective mandates?

The sixkeyPrinciples byGCIM I . Migrating out of choice: migration and the global economy Women, men and children should beable torealize their potential, meet their needs, exercise their human rights and fulfil their aspirations intheir country oforigin, and hence migrate out ofchoice rather than necessity.those women and men who migrate and enter theglobal labour36 toolKIt to CoMBA tSMUGGlING oF MIGRANtS market should beable todosoinasafe and authorized manner, and because they and their skills arevalued and needed bytheStates and societies that receive them. II . Reinforcing economic and developmental impact therolethat migrants play inpromoting development andpoverty they make towards theprosperity ofdestination countries, should be recognized and reinforced. International migration should become anintegral part ofnational, regional and global strategies foreconomic growth, inboth thedeveloping and developed world. III . Addressing irregular migration States, exercising their sovereign right todetermine who enters and remains ontheir territory should fulfil their responsibility and obligation toprotect therights ofmigrants and toreadmit totheir country oforigin. Instemming irregular migration, States should actively cooperate with one another, ensuring that their efforts donot jeopardize human rights, including theright ofrefugees toseek asylum. Governments should consult with employers, trade unions and civil society onthisissue. IV . Strengthening social cohesion through integration Migrants and citizens ofdestination countries should respect their legal obligations and benefit from amutual process ofadaptation and integration that accommodates cultural diversity and fosters social cohesion.the integration process should beactively supported bylocal and national authorities, employers and members ofcivil society, and should bebased onacommitment to non-discrimination and gender equity. Itshould also beinformed byanobjective public, political and media discourse oninternational migration. V . Protecting the rights of migrants thelegal andnormative framework affecting international migrants should bestrengthened, imple- mented more effectively and applied inanon-discriminatory manner, soastoprotect thehuman rights and labour standards that should beenjoyed byallmigrant women and men. Respecting theprovisions ofthislegal and normative framework, States and other stakeholders must address migration issues inamore consistent and coherent manner. VI . Enhancing governance: coherence, capacity and cooperation the governance ofinternational migration should beenhanced byimproved coherence and strengthened capacity atthenational level; greater consultation and cooperation between States atthe regional level; and more effective dialogue and cooperation among Governments and between international organizations attheglobal level. Such efforts must bebased onabetter appreciation oftheclose linkages that exist between international migration and development and other keypolicy issues, including trade, aid, state security, human security and human rights. The GCIM recommendations onaddressing irregular migration areasfollows: States andother stakeholders should engage inanobjective debate about thenegative consequences andtheprevention ofirregular migration. Border control policies should form part ofalong-term approach totheissue of irregular migration that addresses thesocio-economic, governance andhuman rights37 tool 4: PRoBlEM ASSESSMENt AND StRA tEGY DEVEloPMENt deficits that prompt people toleave their own country. This approach must bebased oninter-State dialogue andcooperation. States should address theconditions that promote irregular migration byproviding additional opportunities forregular migration andbytaking action against employers who engage migrants with irregular status. States should resolve thesituation ofmigrants with irregular status bymeans ofreturn orregularization. States must strengthen their efforts tocombat thedistinct criminal phenomena of smuggling ofmigrants and human trafficking. Inboth cases, perpetrators must be prosecuted, thedemand forexploitative services eradicated andappropriate protection andassistance provided tovictims.

Extradition is the surrender by one State of a person present on its territory to another State that seeks this person either for the purpose of prosecution, or for the purpose of enforcing a sentence. For a long time, extradition was largely a matter of reciprocity or comity. Even now, in the absence of a binding treaty, there is no international obligation to extradite. However, there is a growing trend towards recognizing the duty to extradite or prosecute, in particular in relation to certain international crimes, including smuggling of migrants. Some of the most important concerns in relation to extradition are discussed below. Existence of a legal basis for extradition In general, some States require a treaty to extradite and some do not. In States that do require a treaty, bilateral and multilateral treaties can provide the basis for extradition. Multilateral treaties like the Organized Crime Convention are very efficient with regard to extradition as they provide an obligatory basis for extradition, valid for all States parties. Requirements for the application of article 16 on extradition Article 16 of the Organized Crime Convention applies when an offence covered by the Convention involves an organized criminal group and the person sought for extradition is \"located in the territory of the requested State Party\". There is no need to prove that the offence was transnational in nature for the purposes of extradition in cases involving the smuggling of migrants. Dual criminality The requesting State must prove that the criminal offence involving the person who is the subject of the request for extradition is punishable under the domestic law of both the requested and requesting States. This rule has come to be applied less strictly as a result of attempts to list acts that are offences under the Convention and therefore punishable in the jurisdictions of all States parties. Specificity This principle obligates States to specify the offences for which the extradition request is being sent and obligates the requesting State to prosecute only those offences.16 TOOLKIT sought hasalready been Non-extradition of nationals The reluctance ofStates toextradite their own nationals appears tobelessening inmany cases. The Organized Crime Convention includes national, Where extradition isrequested therequested with therequirements ofitsdomestic law. The differences between theprosecutorial practices under common lawandcontinental law systems canmake effective interregional andinternational cooperation thesmuggling aswellasclose coordination with foreign counterparts canmake asignificant contribution tosimplifying extradition procedures.

Cooperation in practice Cooperation between States onreturn issues cantakeplace formally orinformally. Informal mechanisms may bearranged through personal contacts andidentified contact points between counterpart agencies. These mechanisms suffice when returning unlawful migrants inallbutthemost complex cases. Formal mechanisms canbeintheform ofMemorandums ofUnderstanding, exchanges ofDiplomatic Notes orSafe Third Country Agreements (where national legislation requires it). Where informal arrangements areinefficient, bilateral return agreements that facilitate thespeedy oftheir citizens relyoncooperation between States inoperational matters such asestablishing identity andconfirming travel documentation. While many States have found bilateral agreements helpful, others consider that they areredundant inview ofexisting principles ininternational lawobliging states toreadmit areadmission orreturn agreement inplace, return isinthe prevention ofunlawful orunauthorized movements. Inthiscontext, continued cooperation and between states onarange ofissues, including those related toreturn, isimportant.
