History reveals that mortality caused by measles, mumps, polio, diptheria, smallpox, and even scarlet fever (which had no vaccine), were already on the decline even before the vaccines were introduced. These rates continue to decline at the same pace even after the introduction of the vaccines - not faster which one might think. For example, in 1900, the mortality rate from measles was 13.3 deaths in 100,000; in 1940, the mortality rate was 0.5 in 100,000, and in 1960, the mortality rate was just 0.2 deaths in 100,000. The measles vaccine was not introduced until 1963. Thanks to our country becoming more industrialized - such as adopting better hygiene habits, improving sanitation, having better access to clean foods and water, and better educating ourselves \u2014 our nation's disease rates and their mortality rates have decreased as a result.
