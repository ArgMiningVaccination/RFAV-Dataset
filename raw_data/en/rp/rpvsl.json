The following vaccines can now be obtained by NYS Medicaid members, 18 years of age and older: COVID -19 Hepatitis A Hepatitis B Herpes zoster (shingles) Human papillomavirus Influenza (2 years of Measles, mumps, and rubella Meningococcal Pneumococcal Respirator y syncytial virus Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis Varicella NYS Medicaid coverage policy and billing guidance for the administration of COVID -19 vaccines can be found here. Please note: while the COVID -19 vaccines are still provided at no charge, the claim is billed as one single procedure code, with reimbursement for administration included in that code. The following conditions apply: Only Medicaid- enrolled pharmacies will receive reimbursement for immunization services. Services must be provided and documented in accordance with state laws and regulations, including the reporting of all immunizations administered to persons less than 19 years of age to either the State Department of Health (DOH), using the New York State Immunization Information System (NYSIIS), or to the New York Citywide Immunization Registry (CIR). Additional information can be found here. Pharmacies will only be able to bill for Medicaid non- dual-eligible enrollees . Dual-eligible enrollees will continue to access immunization services through Medicare. Medicaid managed care (MMC) enrollees will now access immunization services through NYRx at the pharmacy . Reimbursement for these vaccines may be based on a patient -specific order or non-patient specific order. These orders must be kept on file at the pharmacy. For patient -specific orders, the ordering prescriber\u00b4s National Provider Identification (NPI) is required on the claim for the claim to be paid. Vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for individuals younger than 19 years of age are provided to Medicaid members, both fee -for-service (FFS) and MMC, free of charge by the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program. o Pharmacies wishing to administer VFC -available vaccines to Medicaid members younger than 19 years of age may enroll in the VFC program. Note: The VFC program is currently enrolling pharmacies to receive the influenza vaccine only. Pharmacies immunizing patients 18 years of age with pneumococcal, meningococcal, tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, human papillomavirus, measles, mumps, and rubella, and varicella vaccines may not bill Medicaid for the costs of these vaccines. Patients younger than 19 years of age, and enrolled in Medicaid, are VFC -eligible and may receive these vaccines through a VFC healthcare practice or clinic. Pharma cies that bill Medicaid for the cost of vaccines that are available through the VFC Program are subject to recovery of payment. o Pharmacies that are not enrolled in the VFC program may choose to provide vaccines for members younger than 19 years of age, at no charge to the member or Medicaid program, and will be reimbursed an administration fee of $ 25.10 by NYS Medicaid. o Additional information on the VFC Program, based on location, can be found at the following links: New York City Outside New York City Billing Instructions to NYRx: Consistent with Medicaid immunization policy, pharmacies will bill the administration fee and, when applicable, acquisition cost of the vaccine using the appropriate procedure codes. Procedure codes can be found here. Please note: National Drug Codes (NDCs) are not to be used for billing the vaccine product to NYRx . Reimbursement for the cost of the vaccine for individuals 19 years of age and older will be made at no more than the actual acquisition cost to the pharmacy.

Billing for Immunizations of Members 19 Years of Age and Older: For administration of multiple vaccines on the same date to members 19 years of age and older, procedure code \"90471\" should be used for administration of the first vaccine and \"90472\" for administration of any other vaccines administered on that day. One line should be billed for \"90472\" indicating the additional number of vaccines administered (insert quantity of 1 or 2). Billing for Immunizations for Members younger than 19 Years of Age: For VFC-eligible vaccines , whether enrolled in the VFC Program or not, the pharmacy would submit procedure code \"90460\" (administration of free vaccine) for administration of first or subsequent doses, then submit the appropriate vaccine procedure code(s) with a cost of $0.00. A system edit will ensure that, when there is an incoming claim for the administrative fee (procedure code \"90460\" ), there is also a claim in history for a VFC - eligib le vaccine procedure code, reimbursed at $0.00.
