These are our favorite herbs and essential oils to use for celebrating the esbat. Celebrating the Full Moon Around the world and throughout history it is well documented that we are affected by the cycles of the moon. Through time our ancestors have honored the moon cycle in various ways. Pagans and Heathens may have Full Moon Celebrations to honor the God or Goddess of the moon. Solitary Practitioners tend to find their own way to incorporate these cycles into their daily practice. Many Christian and Jewish holidays are also based off of this moon cycle. The cycle affects the earth through the ocean tides and is believed to also affect our emotions. Full Moon on our YouTube Channel Full Moon Energy The intention of the Full Moon is \"Completion of the Cycle and Release of the Old Pattern\". As we draw closer to the full moon we should be focusing on tying up our loose ends, finishing the things that we have started, and letting go of the things that no longer serve us. It is a good time to work on kicking bad habits to the curb, cleaning, cleansing, and detoxing our homes or our own energy fields (Aura), or breaking off relations with those who are causing you harm. Below is a list of herbs and oils that are associated with the full moon. Using these ingredients to create your pagan crafted loose incense, offering herbs, anointing oils, and ritual baths are ways to help align your energies with these intentions and to honor this part of the Esbat Cycle. Are you ready to celebrate and move forward in balance?
