All of us hope that each of you find this a useful resource in your work with, and involving, animals and the law. The editors have designed this book principally to serve as an edited collection of Tennessee statutes relating to animals. Because these statutes were collected and edited, the collection is necessarily incomplete. The criteria and process used by the editors in selecting statutes of interest to our target audiences were thoughtfully conceived. However, the choices they made may differ from those that you would make. We welcome feedback from you\u2014including suggestions for future editions\u2014as to how we can better edit this resource to serve your needs. Moreover, especially because this book is a selective collection of statutory law available on a specific date, readers should not rely on this book as a source of legal advice. The legislature of the State of Tennessee can and will add, modify, and repeal laws in every legislative session. Additionally, courts have the opportunity to interpret and add to the law with each new case that properly comes before them. Finally, ordinances and other rules serve to make these laws applicable and enforceable on a local level. The interaction of these sources of regulation is complex and the rules of conduct that result from that interaction are best identified and explained by attorneys licensed to practice in the State of Tennessee that are familiar with the applicable statutes, court cases, ordinances, and other rules. We urge you to seek counsel from these legal advisors in interpreting and using the statutes presented in this book; a mere reading of the statutes is not enough to ensure complete understanding. With all that having been said, we offer you this volume for use in your work. Use this resource well, use it often; and, as requested above, do give us your feedback on its contents. We look forward to hearing from you.

The acknowledgements provided here only touch upon those who have been essential to the production of this resource. However, one thing is clear. This volume is made possible by its core sponsors: The Companion Animal Initiative of Tennessee at the University of Tennessee College of Veterinary Medicine and the Animal Legal Defense Fund Student Chapter at the University of Tennessee College of Law. The two Colleges provide research funding and administrative support for this effort at a time when human and money capital are somewhat scarce. The editors are especially grateful for the ongoing support and assistance provided by the Colleges, and for the foundational work done on this book by former Companion Animal Initiative of Tennessee director Teresa Fisher, former College of Veterinary Medicine students Kara Campadonico and Clarivel Hernandez, and former College of Law students Kelli Braud, McKenna Cox, Cherie DuBois, and Anne Kemp. 5 Table of Contents \u00a7 4-3-203 Department of Agriculture powers and duties .................................................................... 22 \u00a7 4-3-610 Acquiring dogs for detection of drugs 22 \u00a7 4-5-208 Emergency rules ................................................................................................................. 22 \u00a7 4-7-106 (Tennessee Highway Patrol) Enforcement of animal disease laws ...................................... 23 \u00a7 4-7-115 (Tennessee Highway Patrol) Use of dogs to detect drugs .................................................... 23 \u00a7 5-1-115 Removal of vegetation and debris from certain lots ........................................................... 24 \u00a7 5-1-120 Power to regulate stray animals \u00a7 5-9-110 Animal welfare ................................................................................................................... 26 \u00a7 6-2-201 authority generally -- general powers ................................................................ 26 \u00a7 6-19-101 Powers under city manager -- general powers .................................................................. 26 \u00a7 6-54-113 Removal of vegetation and debris from certain lots ......................................................... 30 \u00a7 6-54-135 Allowing pet dogs in outdoor dining areas at restaurants ................................................. 32 \u00a7 7-5-103 Metropolitan establishments -- part definitions ........................................................... 33 \u00a7 7-63-101 Municipal violations -- Citation or complaint in lieu of arrest ........................................... 34 \u00a7 7-63-201 Sanitation, litter control and animal control -- issuance of summons -- copies .................. 34 \u00a7 7-81-207 Powers of assembly [relevant .......................................... 34 \u00a7 7-86-307 Plan for providing statewide 911 and enhanced wireless 911 service.

Such rules and regulations shall be promulgated in accordance with the provisions of the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, compiled in chapter 5 of this title, except as otherwise provided by law. (B) The enactment of a federal declaration of an extraordinary emergency or issuance of an emergency federal order or similar federal enactment that relates to the spread of plant or animal disease, the spread of pests from state to state, the protection of the food or feed supply, or that otherwise relates matters generally regulated by the department shall be deemed to constitute sufficient evidence of an immediate danger to the public health, safety or welfare of such a nature to justify the enactment of emergency rules for purposes of \u00a7 4-5-208(a). \u00a7 4-3-610 Acquiring dogs for detection of drugs (a) The state of Tennessee, acting though the commissioner and department of correction, is authorized to assist counties and municipalities in acquiring dogs trained to detect marijuana and other illicit substances for use in jails and workhouses for the purposes set out in \u00a7 41-1-118. (b) Sheriffs, police chiefs and other local law enforcement officials are encouraged to utilize the dogs provided for in subsection (a). \u00a7 4-5-208 Emergency rules (a) An agency may, upon stating its reasons in writing for making such findings, proceed 23 without prior notice or hearing to adopt an emergency rule, if the agency finds that: (1) An immediate danger to the public health, safety or welfare exists, and the nature of this danger is such that the use of any other form of rulemaking authorized by this chapter would not adequately protect the public; (2) The rule only delays the effective date of another rule that is not yet effective; (3) It is required by the constitution or court order; (4) It is required by an agency of the federal government and adoption of the rule through ordinary rulemaking procedures described in this chapter might jeopardize the loss of a federal program or funds; or (5) The agency is required by an enactment of the general assembly to implement rules within a prescribed period of time that precludes utilization of rulemaking procedures described elsewhere in this chapter for the promulgation of permanent rules. (b) The emergency rule shall become effective immediately, unless otherwise stated in the rule, upon a copy of the rule and a copy of the written statement of the reasons for the rule being filed with the secretary of state. The emergency rule may be effective for a period of not longer than one hundred eighty (180) days. An agency shall not adopt the same or a substantially similar emergency rule within one (1) calendar year from its first adoption, unless the agency clearly establishes that it could not reasonably be foreseen during the initial one hundred eighty-day period that the emergency would continue or would likely recur during the next nine (9) months. The adoption of the same or substantially similar rule through ordinary rulemaking procedures authorized by this chapter shall not be precluded by this section. (c) The agency shall take steps to make emergency rules known to persons who will be affected by the rules. The secretary of state shall post the emergency rule filing to the administrative register web site within two (4) business days of filing. An emergency rule filing shall remain on the administrative register website until the filing expires. The secretary of state shall update relevant rules to reflect the filing and the expiration of emergency rules. (d) In any action contesting a rule adopted in reliance upon this section, the burden of persuasion shall be upon the agency to demonstrate that the rule meets the criteria established by this section. (e) An agency's finding of an emergency pursuant to this section shall not be based upon the agency's failure to timely process and file rules through the normal rulemaking process. \u00a7 4-7-106 (Tennessee Highway Patrol) Enforcement of animal disease laws (a) The Tennessee highway patrol is granted the further authority, and it is its duty, to enforce title 44, chapter 2, part 1, relative to the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases among domestic animals and protection to the livestock industry.

The cost shall be a lien upon the property in favor of the county. These costs shall be placed upon the tax rolls of the county as a lien upon the property and shall be collected in the same manner as the county's taxes are collected, when the county causes a notice thereof to be filed in the office of the register of deeds of the county in which the property lies, second only to liens of the state, county and municipality for taxes, any lien of the county for special assessments and any valid lien, right or interest in such property duly recorded or duly perfected by filing, prior to the filing of such notice.

The county shall provide for a hearing upon request of the person aggrieved by the determination made pursuant to subsection (b). A request for a hearing shall be made within ten (10) days following the receipt of the notice issued pursuant to subsection (b). Failure to make the request within this time shall without exception constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing. 25 (2) Any person aggrieved by an order or act of the board, agency or commission under this subsection (d) may seek judicial review of the order or act. The time period established in subsection (c) shall be stayed during the pendency of a hearing.

These honeybees perform a pollination function that is essential to the propagation of many species of flowering plants in Tennessee. These flowering plants include many agricultural crops, wildflowers, and forest plants that are of great importance to all Tennesseans, and the honeybees are the major pollinator for most of these plants. Therefore, the state should take appropriate actions to help assure the continued availability of an adequate population of honeybee pollinators. Honeybees, like other animal species, are afflicted by a variety of contagious diseases and pests that can cause serious population reductions. The natural behavior of honeybees cause them to be interactive with bees from other colonies and therefore vulnerable to transmission of some diseases and pests. Therefore, persons involved in the keeping of bees in a given area can engage in beekeeping practices that will have a real and direct impact on the honeybees and beekeeping in surrounding areas. This chapter enables and provides for the development of regulatory programs for beekeeping activities in the state as may be needed to help protect honeybees from diseases, pests, and other threats that could seriously reduce the availability of the honeybee pollinators. \u00a7 44-15-102 Chapter definitions As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires: (1) \"Abandoned apiaries\" means an apiary that has not been subjected to at least the minimal beekeeping practices necessary to maintain the bees in a healthy, productive, and safe condition so that the honeybees and beekeepers in surrounding areas will not be adversely affected; (2) \"Advisory committee\" or \"ATAC\" means the apicultural technical advisory committee that is established pursuant to this chapter; (3) \"Apiary\" means a collection of one (1) or more colonies of bees in beehives at a location.

Prior to the public recordation of any instrument evidencing an indebtedness, including, but not limited to, mortgages, deeds of trust, conditional sales contracts, financing statements contemplated by the Uniform Commercial Code, compiled in title 47, and liens on personalty, other than on motor vehicles, there shall be paid a tax, for state purposes only, of eleven and one half cents (11.5\u00a2) on each one hundred dollars ($100) of the indebtedness so evidenced. (1) The tax shall not be required for the recordation statements filed pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code, compiled in title 47, that secure an interest solely in investment property, as defined in \u00a7 47-9-102(a) as amended by chapter 846, \u00a7 1 of the Acts of 2000, and mortgages or deeds of trust issued under the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Act, as compiled in title 47, chapter 30, and that are labeled on the face under such chapter. (2) In any case where the consideration or stipulation of indebtedness does not appear on the face of the instrument being offered for record, the recording official shall require a separate statement, to be made under oath, indicating the amount of the indebtedness so secured. (3) This tax shall be paid to and collected by county registers, the secretary of state, and any other official who may receive any instrument other than for liens on motor vehicles in accordance with the motor vehicle title law of this state, for recordation in accordance with the laws of this state, and registration is forbidden until such tax 180 has been paid. (4) The incidence of the tax provided by this section is declared to be upon the mortgagor, grantor or debtor, evidenced by the instrument offered for recordation. It shall not, however, apply with respect to the first two thousand dollars ($2,000) of the indebtedness. (5) (A) As used in this section, \"indebtedness\" means the principal debt or obligation which is reasonably contemplated by the parties to be included within the terms of the agreement. \"Indebtedness\" does not include any amount of interest, collection expense including, but not limited to, attorney's fees and expenses incurred in preserving, protecting, improving, or insuring property which serves as collateral for the indebtedness, or any other amount, other than the principal debt or obligation, for which a debtor becomes liable unless such amount is added to the principal debt or obligation, and is used to calculate additional interest pursuant to refinancing, reamortization, amendment or similar transaction or occurrence. (B) If the instrument is given to secure the performance by the mortgagor, grantor, debtor or any other person of an obligation other than the payment of a specific sum of money, and a maximum amount secured is not expressed in the instrument, such instrument shall be taxable upon the value of the property covered by the instrument, which value shall be deemed to be the indebtedness secured by such instrument for such purposes. Such instrument shall not be recorded, unless, at the time of presenting the instrument, there is filed a sworn statement by the owner of the property covered thereby of the value of the property. Such amount shall be the basis of assessing the tax imposed under this subsection (b). No subsequent change in the value of the property shall result in the imposition of additional tax. (C) (i) Every recorded instrument evidencing an indebtedness must contain, either on the face of the instrument or in an attached sworn statement, the following language: \"Maximum principal indebtedness for Tennessee recording tax purposes is $.\" The holder of the indebtedness shall state the amount of the indebtedness, and that amount shall be the basis of assessing the tax imposed by this subsection (b). Such statement may be relied upon only by the department of revenue and by the receiving official charged with the duty of recordation and collection of tax, and such statement shall not constitute notice of any kind to any other party of the amount of indebtedness secured by the instrument. (ii) Notwithstanding subdivision (b)(5)(C)(i), an instrument described in subdivision (b)(5)(B) shall instead contain, either on the face of the instrument or in an attached sworn statement, the following language: \"Secures obligation other than payment of specific sum \u2014 valuation statement submitted herewith.\" (iii) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, an official charged with the collection of the tax imposed by this subsection (b) shall not record any instrument evidencing an indebtedness, unless it contains the statement required by this subdivision (b)(5)(C) and tax is properly paid, based upon the amount contained in that statement or in the valuation statement, as appropriate. (D) When the instrument being offered for registration, recording, or filing secures, or evidences the securing of, a line of credit or other indebtedness arising from more than one (1) advance or extension of credit, the amount of which will, or 181 may, vary from time to time, the tax shall be computed and paid on the maximum amount of the indebtedness as stated in the instrument or the accompanying sworn statement, and the reduction or subsequent increasing of the amount of the indebtedness within such limits shall not result in additional tax. (6) Imposition of a transfer tax as levied under subsection (a) with respect to an instrument evidencing an indebtedness shall not operate to exonerate such instrument from the tax levied under this subsection (b), if such tax would otherwise be appropriate. Furthermore, an instrument evidencing transfer of any interest in real estate that is subject to the transfer tax shall, nevertheless, be subject to the tax levied under this subsection (b) also, when such instrument evidences an indebtedness either by showing in the instrument that a vendor's lien is retained, or by referring in the instrument to such a lien being evidenced by another instrument not being offered for public recordation. (7) (A) (i) If some of the property securing the payment of the indebtedness is located in Tennessee and some is located outside of Tennessee, as an optional method of computing the tax, the tax may be apportioned and paid on the basis of the ratio of the value of the Tennessee collateral to the value of all collateral, by applying the following mathematical formula: value of Tennessee collateral / value of total collateral = % x indebtedness = taxable Tennessee indebtedness (ii) If the tax is apportioned pursuant to this subdivision (b)(7), no evidence of the calculation or statement of tax shall be required in addition to the statement required by subdivision (b)(5)(C), which shall be completed with the amount resulting from the calculation made pursuant to subdivision (b)(7)(A)(i). (B) For purposes of the apportionment calculation allowed in subdivision (b)(7)(A)(i): (i) \"Collateral\" means any real property or personal property securing the indebtedness evidenced by the instrument to be filed or recorded; (ii) \"Mobile goods\" means goods that are mobile and that are of a type normally used in more than one (1) jurisdiction, such as trailers, rolling stock, airplanes, shipping containers, road building and construction machinery, commercial harvesting machinery and the like; (iii) \"Taxable Tennessee indebtedness\" means the amount of indebtedness on which tax is to be calculated as provided in subdivision (b)(4), with the two-thousand-dollar ($2,000) exemption to be applied to the taxable Tennessee indebtedness; (iv) \"Tennessee collateral\" means all collateral in which a security interest, deed of trust, mortgage lien or other consensual lien is perfected by filing or recording one or more instruments in the state of Tennessee or by other methods where the laws of the state of Tennessee govern perfection; provided, however, that the Tennessee collateral of a debtor that is located in Tennessee, as determined pursuant to \u00a7 47-9-307, does not include such debtor's interests in: (a) Any personal property physically located outside the state of Tennessee, including goods, other than mobile goods, and any property that is of a type in which a security interest could be perfected by possession under Tennessee law if such property were located in Tennessee, such as certificated securities, chattel paper, documents, instruments and money; or (b) Any intangible property and mobile goods, unless such debtor's chief executive office is also located in the state of Tennessee. Any subsequent 182 change in the location of the debtor or any collateral, in the facts supporting the categorization of any particular collateral, or in the relative quantities or values of collateral shall not in itself result in the imposition of additional tax; (v) \"Total collateral\" means all collateral, including the Tennessee collateral; and (vi) \"Value\" of collateral means the value that the collateral would command at a fair and voluntary sale. (8) In the event of an increase in the indebtedness beyond the amount stated subsequent to the filing or recordation of the instrument, the holder of the indebtedness shall pay the tax on the amount of the increase. Such a payment shall be due on the date the increase occurs, but may be made without penalty if made within sixty (60) days after the increase occurs. Thereafter, such payment may be made only upon payment of the penalty provided in subdivision (b)(12) based on the amount of the increase in the indebtedness. (9) Section \u00a7 67-4-206 and \u00a7 67-4-217 shall not apply to the tax imposed by this subsection (b). (10) (A) Nonpayment or underpayment of tax on an indebtedness, or failure timely to pay tax on an increase in indebtedness, shall not affect or impair the effectiveness, validity, priority, or enforceability of the security interest or lien created or evidenced by the instrument, it being declared the legislative intent that the effectiveness, validity, priority, and enforceability of security interest and liens are governed solely by law applicable to security interests and liens, and not by this title. (B) Such nonpayment, underpayment, or failure to pay, until cured, shall result in the imposition of a tax lien, in the amount of any tax and penalties unpaid and owing under this subsection (b), in favor of the department of revenue as described in subdivision (b)(11), shall subject the holder of the indebtedness to a penalty as described in subdivision (b)(12), and shall subject the holder of the indebtedness to the disability described in subdivision (b)(13). (11) The tax lien described in subdivision (b)(10) shall arise at the time the tax is due and shall at that time attach to any property, either real or personal, tangible or intangible, subject to the instrument until: (A) The lien or security interest of the instrument is released with respect to any property; or (B) Any property is transferred in settlement or realization of the lien or security interest, whereupon the tax lien shall automatically be released from such property and attach to any proceeds thereof. The department may not levy upon or sell any property subject to the tax lien until notice of the tax lien has been recorded pursuant to \u00a7 67-1-1403 but notwithstanding such section, the department otherwise shall not be required to record any notice of the tax lien. The tax lien shall be superior to all liens and security interest under Tennessee law, except: (i) Those enumerated in \u00a7 67-1-1403(c)(2)-(4) that were recorded, filed or perfected, respectively, prior to attachment of the tax lien; and (ii) County and municipal ad valorem taxes. (12) It is the duty of every holder of an indebtedness, including an individual, business entity of any organizational structure, or governmental entity, to collect the tax imposed by this subsection (b) from the debtor and to remit the tax as required by this subsection (b). Except as provided in subdivision (b)(8), if the holder of the indebtedness fails to pay or underpays the tax imposed by this subsection (b), the holder of the indebtedness shall be liable for a penalty, in addition to the tax, in the 183 amount of two hundred fifty dollars ($250) or double the unpaid tax due, whichever is greater. (13) The holder of an indebtedness evidenced or secured by an instrument upon the recording or filing of which tax is owing under this section may not maintain an action on such indebtedness, other than an action limited to the enforcement of the holder's security interest or lien, against the debtor until such nonpayment is cured. If such an action is commenced and a cure is not effected within a time limit set by the court, the debtor may obtain a dismissal of such action, without prejudice to refiling in the event of a subsequent cure of nonpayment. Notwithstanding the terms of the instrument, if a cure is not effected until after the filing of a motion or pleading in which the holder's noncompliance with this subsection (b) is raised, the holder may not thereafter charge the debtor with the costs of curing such noncompliance. (c) Any oath required in subsections (a) and (b) shall not be introduced as evidence in any proceeding conducted in connection with any condemnation action for the purpose of indicating the value of such real property. (d) Reports and Payment of Tax to the Commissioner. (1) The county register and other officials charged with the collection of taxes imposed under this section shall report all collections to the department on forms prescribed by the commissioner, in the same manner and under the same conditions as county clerks collect and report revenue under parts 2-6 of this chapter. (2) (A) For collecting and reporting taxes levied under this section, county registers shall be entitled to retain as commission five percent (5%) of the taxes so collected. (B) Notwithstanding subdivision (d)(2)(A) or any other law to the contrary, fifty-two percent (52%) of the five percent (5%) commission provided by subdivision (d)(2)(A) shall be remitted to the state treasurer and credited to the general fund of the state. (3) The county registers shall also be entitled to receive as a fee for issuing each receipt for taxes imposed in this section the sum of one dollar ($1.00), to be paid when the tax receipt is issued. The fee, however, shall not be applicable nor collectible by any state officials charged with the collection of taxes imposed under this section. (e) Instruments made pursuant to mergers, consolidations, sales or transfers of substantially all of the assets in this state of corporations, pursuant to plans of reorganization, are exempt from this section. (f) (1) The recording and rerecording of all transfers of realty in which a municipality is the grantee or transferee and all instruments evidencing an indebtedness in which a municipality is the holder or owner of the indebtedness shall be exempt from this section. The recording and rerecording of all instruments evidencing an indebtedness of any health and educational facility corporation formed pursuant to title 48, chapter 101, part 3 shall also be exempt from this section. (2) For the purposes of this subsection (f), \"municipality\" means the state of Tennessee or any county or incorporated city or town, utility district, school district, power district, sanitary district, or other municipal, quasi-municipal, or governmental body or political subdivision in this state, and any agency, authority, branch, bureau, commission, corporation, department or instrumentality thereof now or later authorized to be created. (3) The recording or rerecording of any transfer of realty to or from any municipality and any evidence of indebtedness of or to any municipality, as defined in 184 subsection (a), prior to May 11, 1971, and otherwise validly made, is declared to be valid and effective, notwithstanding any failure to pay the tax formerly imposed by this section, and any such recording or rerecording is ratified, approved and confirmed, and no tax shall be imposed or collected on account of any such recording or rerecording. (g) Wetland Acquisition Fund. (1) Three and one fourth cents (3.25\u00a2) of the tax levied by subsection (a) shall be credited to a special agency account in the state general fund known as the 1986 wetland acquisition fund; provided, that such funds shall not be obligated or expended to acquire any interest in real property through condemnation or the power of eminent domain. Expenditures from such fund shall only be made to implement and effectuate the purposes of title 11, chapter 14, part 4. The fund may be expended to maintain and enhance state-owned property that is under the agency's jurisdiction. Funds deposited in such fund shall not revert at the end of any fiscal year, and all interest accruing on investments and deposits of the fund not otherwise expended shall be returned to and made a part of the fund. (2) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, the commissioner of finance and administration, with the written approval of the executive director of the Tennessee wildlife resources agency, is authorized, subject to legislative appropriation, to transfer funds from the 1986 wetland acquisition fund to the Tennessee heritage conservation trust fund, created in title 11, chapter 7, part 1. For the purposes of \u00a7 11-7-103(h), \"other available sources\" also shall not include any funds transferred to the Tennessee heritage conservation trust fund from the 1986 wetland acquisition fund pursuant to this subdivision (g)(2). (h) Exception for Certain Facilities. (1) With respect to any facility as defined in subdivision (h)(2)(A): (A) The taxes paid under subsection (a) shall not exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) in the aggregate; and (B) The taxes paid under subsection (b) shall not exceed five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) in the aggregate. (2) (A) As used in this subsection (h), \"facility\" means any real or personal property that is constructed, acquired or developed for the principal purpose of manufacturing, processing, fabricating or assembling any manufactured products and includes, but is not limited to, all or any part of or any interest in any land and building, including office, administration or other buildings, any improvement to the facilities and all real and personal properties, including, but is not limited to, equipment and machinery deemed necessary in connection with the facility, whether or not now in existence. (B) As used in this subsection (h), \"related indebtedness\" means indebtedness relating to or incurred to finance a portion of or otherwise in connection with a facility, which shall be evidenced by instruments, including, but not limited to, mortgages, deeds of trust, conditional sales contracts, financing statements contemplated by the Uniform Commercial Code, compiled in title 47, and liens on personalty, notwithstanding the fact that portions of such indebtedness may be held by different holders, owners, trustees or other secured parties (holders) of indebtedness or portions of indebtedness relating to the facility. (3) In order to qualify for the exception provided under this subsection (h), prior to the public recordation of any instrument evidencing a transfer of an interest in realty or of any instrument evidencing a related indebtedness under this section, the grantee or transferee of the interest in such realty or the holder of related indebtedness must submit a sworn statement declaring the amount of tax paid for recording instruments 185 by or on behalf of the person, corporation, or other entity that owns, leases or otherwise operates the facility, referred to in this subsection (h) as the taxpayer, under both subsection (a), with respect to the transfer of realty pertaining to the facility, and subsection (b), with respect to related indebtedness, and a copy of each receipt for the taxes paid for recording such instruments or other evidence of such payments. No tax will be due, if the taxes paid by or on behalf of the taxpayer for recording such instruments pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) relating to the facility and any related indebtedness equal an aggregate amount of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000), as the case may be. If less than the aggregate amount of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000), as the case may be, in taxes for recording instruments pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) relating to the facility and any related indebtedness has been paid by or on behalf of the taxpayer prior to the proposed recordation of any instrument evidencing a transfer of an interest in realty or related indebtedness, the grantee or transferee of an interest in such realty or the holder of related indebtedness must pay or cause to be paid the amount of tax due, calculated in accordance with this section, which amount shall be no more than the difference between one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000), and the aggregate amount of such taxes paid by or on behalf of the taxpayer for recording instruments pertaining to the facility and any related indebtedness pursuant to subsections (a) and (b).

(i) Local Parks Land Acquisition Fund. (1) One and three fourths cents (1.75\u00a2) of the tax levied by subsection (a) shall be credited to a special agency account in the state general fund known as the local parks land acquisition fund. The moneys in this fund shall be used only for grants to county and municipal governments to implement and carry out the purposes set forth in subdivision (i)(3); provided, that the commissioner of environment and conservation may allocate not more than three and one-half percent (3.5%) of the moneys in this fund for the administration of the fund. Funds deposited in such fund shall not revert at the end of any fiscal year, and all interest accruing on investments and deposits of the fund not otherwise expended shall be returned to and made a part of the fund. (2) (A) The commissioner of environment and conservation, the commissioner of agriculture and the director of the wildlife resources agency shall jointly establish priorities for the appropriate allocation of funds, deposited in the local parks land acquisition fund.

(B) At least sixty percent (60%) of the funds allocated annually shall go to municipal governments. (3) County and municipal governments may use the funds allocated under this section for the purchase of land for parks, natural areas, greenways, and for the purchase of land for recreation facilities. Such funds may also be used for trail development and capital projects in parks, natural areas, and greenways. (4) (A) Any county or municipal government that receives a grant under this section must match the grant with an equal amount of money for each project. The 186 matching money provided by the local government may be used to purchase additional land or to develop facilities on the land that is purchased with the grant. Rather than providing matching money, the local government may provide as its match a tract of land not previously used for park or recreational purposes that will be dedicated entirely for park or recreational purposes after receipt of the grant and that is independently appraised as having the same, or greater, value as the amount of the state grant.

(5) Acquisition pursuant to this subsection (j) of property classified under chapter 5, part 10 of this title, shall not constitute a change in the use of the property, and no rollback taxes shall become due solely as a result of such acquisition. (6) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, the commissioner of finance and administration, with the written approval of the commissioner of environment and conservation, is authorized, subject to legislative appropriation, to transfer funds from the state lands acquisition fund to the Tennessee heritage conservation trust fund, created in title 11, chapter 7, part 1.

The commissioner of environment and conservation, commissioner of agriculture and the director of the wildlife resources agency shall jointly establish priorities for the appropriate allocation of funds deposited in the agricultural resources conservation fund. No project shall receive any such funds unless each such official has approved such expenditure. The commissioner of agriculture may promulgate regulations to implement this subsection (l). (3) Expenditures from the agricultural resources conservation fund shall be made for the promotion and implementation of agricultural management practices that conserve and protect natural resources associated with agricultural production, 188 including, but not limited to, soil, water, air, plants and animals.

No more than ten percent (10%) of the annual appropriation from this fund may be used for management costs associated with technical assistance to accomplish the purposes of the fund and/or the administration of the fund. It is the intent of the general assembly that the highest priority of the agricultural resources conservation fund is to abate and prevent nonpoint source water pollution that may be associated with agricultural production; therefore, the commissioner of agriculture may spend no more than fifteen percent (15%) of the annual appropriations from the fund for the combined purposes of preventing or remedying air, noise, dust, and odor pollution, or similar nuisance type environmental problems associated with agricultural production. The commissioner of agriculture may expend agricultural resources conservation funds as matching dollars to secure additional funding to fulfill the purposes for which the fund was established.

(D) In any county with a population of not less than four hundred thirty-two thousand two hundred (432,200) nor more than four-hundred thirty-two thousand three hundred (432,300), according to the 2010 federal census or any subsequent federal census, or within a municipality located within such county, if a nonprofit children's hospital changes the use of one (1) or more parcels of land or portions thereof for the purpose of carrying out one (1) or more of the exempt purposes for which the institution was created or exists, the institution may claim and file an application for exemption under this section or \u00a767-5-213, and the effective date of such exemption shall be up to three (3) years prior to the date of application, or the date the institution began to use the property for exempt purposes, whichever is later. In determining the date that a qualifying institution begins using property for an exempt purpose, subsection (g) applies to the full extent of both improvements and underlying real property so that the entire property, to the extent that the full value of underlying land and any improvements thereon, is considered to be occupied and used by the qualifying institution or its officers purely and exclusively for the institution's purposes from and after the commencement of construction of improvements. This subdivision (b)(3)(D) applies to properties acquired before May 15, 2018, so that such properties are not subject to taxation under this chapter while owned by the qualifying institution and used for one (1) or more of the exempt purposes for which the institution was created or exists, and any property taxes paid on such property that were collected prior to May 15, 2018, shall be refunded. (4) All questions of exemption under this section shall be subject to review and final determination by the board; provided, that any determination by the board is subject to judicial review by petition of certiorari to the appropriate chancery court. All other provisions of law notwithstanding, no property shall be entitled to judicial review of its status under this statute, except as provided by the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, compiled in title 4, chapter 5, and only after the exhaustion of administrative remedies as provided in this section. (5) The state board of equalization may revoke any exemption approved under this section, either in whole or in part, if it determines that the exemption was approved on the basis of fraud, misrepresentation, or erroneous information, that the current owner of the property does not qualify for exemption, or that the property is not actually being used for an exempt purpose. Property is not actually being used for an exempt purpose if the property is not currently in use, has been abandoned, is not suitable for human habitation, or is being used for a nonexempt purpose. The executive secretary of the board may initiate proceedings for revocation on the executive secretary's own motion or upon the written complaint of any person upon a determination of probable cause. Revocation shall not be retroactive, unless the order of revocation incorporates a finding of fraud or misrepresentation on the part of the applicant or failure of the applicant to give notice of a change in the use or ownership of the property as required by this section. (c) As used in this section, \"charitable institution\" includes any nonprofit organization or association devoting its efforts and property, or any portion thereof, exclusively to the improvement of human rights and/or conditions in the community.

System: Functions & Jurisdictions The Federal Court System: When you should file in federal court There are federal courts located in every state. Tennessee has three separate federal districts located in West, Middle, and East Tennessee. Tennessee is part of the Sixth Circuit, along with Kentucky, Ohio, and Michigan. Generally, in order for a case to be heard in federal court, the case must meet certain threshold requirements. First, under the U.S. Constitution, federal courts exercise only judicial powers. This means that federal judges may interpret the law only by resolving actual legal disputes. A court cannot attempt to correct a legal problem just because it thinks one exists, nor can it answer a hypothetical legal question. Instead, an actual person or persons must be damaged by another or by a law. This person or persons must then bring a legal action in order to redress his or her wrong. Second, assuming there is an actual case, the plaintiff in a federal lawsuit must have legal \"standing\" to ask the court for a decision. \"Standing\" refers to the requirement that the plaintiff suffer an actual harm by the defendant or by an applicable law. Third, the case must present a type of dispute that the questionable law was designed to address. The case must also involve a complaint that the court has the power to remedy. In other words, the court must be authorized, under the Constitution or a federal law, to hear the case and grant appropriate relief to the plaintiff. Finally, the case must present an ongoing problem that the court is permitted to resolve. The harm cannot be theoretical or without merit. Moreover, the federal courts only can decide the types of cases allowed by Congress under, or otherwise identified in, the Constitution. The details of federal jurisdiction are complex and beyond the scope of this brief description. However, federal courts hear two main types of cases: (1) cases involving federal law questions, and (2) cases involving diversity jurisdiction. a. Federal Question Jurisdiction: A case that involves a question of federal law may be filed in a federal court. In general, federal courts may decide cases that involve the U.S. government, the U.S. Constitution, federal laws, or controversies between states or between the United States and foreign governments. b. Diversity Jurisdiction: A case may be filed in federal court based on diversity of citizenship, where the parties are citizens of different states, or citizens of the United States and another country. To make sure the court is fair to the out-of-state party, the U.S. Constitution allows these cases to be heard in federal court. **Only Diversity Jurisdiction cases involving more than $75,000 in potential damages for each plaintiff may be filed in federal court. Claims below that amount must be pursued in state court. Additionally, any Diversity Jurisdiction case, regardless of the amount of money involved, may be brought in a state court rather than a federal court. For a more complete explanation of who may file in federal court and when, see Rules 8, 12, and 17(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Although federal courts are located in every state, they are not the only forum available 281 to those who want to file suit. In fact, the great majority of legal disputes in American courts are addressed in the state courts. For example, state courts have jurisdiction over virtually all divorce and child custody matters, probate and inheritance issues, real estate questions, and juvenile matters, and they handle most criminal cases, contract disputes, traffic violations, and personal injury cases. (See Appendix One.) The Federal Courts: How They Work Trial Courts: The United States District Courts are the general trial courts in the federal court system. There also are two special federal trial courts that have the authority to hear certain types of cases throughout the country: the Court of International Trade and the United States Court of Federal Claims. 1. District Court: Within limits set by Congress and the Constitution, the district courts have jurisdiction to hear nearly all categories of federal cases, including both civil and criminal matters. There are ninety-four federal judicial districts, including at least one district in each state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Each district also includes a United States Bankruptcy Court. Three territories of the United States \u2014 the Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands \u2014 have district courts that hear federal cases, including bankruptcy cases. 2. Court of International Trade: The Court of International Trade addresses cases involving international trade and customs issues only. 3. The United States Court of Federal Claims: The United States Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction over most claims for money damages against the United States, disputes over federal contracts, unlawful \"takings\" of private property by the federal government, and a variety of other claims against the United States. Appellate Courts: The ninety-four judicial districts are organized into twelve regional circuits, each of which has a United States Court of Appeals. A thirteenth Court of Appeals hears cases involving certain specialized matters. 1. Court of Appeals: A Court of Appeals hears cases appealed from the district courts located within its circuit, as well as appeals from decisions of federal administrative agencies. There are twelve regional branches of the Court of Appeals. 2. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit: The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals can hear specialized cases from anywhere in the country, such as those involving patent laws and cases decided by the Court of International Trade and the United States Court of Federal Claims. There is only one Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The United States Supreme Court The United States Supreme Court consists of the Chief Justice of the United States and eight associate justices. The United States Supreme Court may decide which cases it wishes to hear, as long as it abides by certain guidelines established by Congress. The United States Supreme Court only hears a fraction of the cases it is asked to decide each year. Those cases may begin in the federal or state courts, and they usually involve important questions about the U.S. Constitution or federal law. (See \"Understanding the Federal Courts,\" www.uscourts.gov/understand03/index.html) 282 APPENDIX THREE: Federal Animal Protection Statutes Airborne Hunting Act 16 U.S.C. \u00a7742j-1 (2008) The Airborne Hunting Act criminalizes shooting any bird, fish, or other animal while in an aircraft, using an aircraft to harass any bird, fish, or other animal, or knowingly participating in these activities. People employed or authorized by either the state or federal government to administer or protect \"land, water, wildlife, domesticated animals, human life, or crops\" are exempted from this statute. Animal Damage Control Act 7 U.S.C. \u00a78351 (2008) This statute authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct wildlife services programs concerning injurious animal species and to take any action necessary to conduct those programs. It also authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to enter agreements with states, individuals, public and private agencies, and others in order to control mammals and birds that are a nuisance or harbor zoonotic diseases. Urban rodent control is exempted from the scope of this program. Animal Enterprise Terrorism 18 U.S.C. \u00a743 (2008) This statute criminalizes using or conspiring to interstate or foreign commerce or the mail to physically disrupt animal enterprises. Criminal disruptions include loss of property (including animals and records), criminal trespass, harassment, and intentionally placing a person in fear of death or serious bodily injury. The statute also delineates types of penalties, which include fines, imprisonment, and restitution. Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act of 2007 18 U.S.C \u00a749 (2014) This statute amends the federal criminal code to impose a fine or prison term of up to five years on someone who violated with Animal Welfare Act by doing any of the following: (1) sponsoring or exhibiting an animal in an animal fighting venture; (2) buying, selling, transporting, delivering, or receiving for purposes of transportation, in interstate or foreign commerce, any dog or other animal for participation in an animal fighting venture; and (3) using the mails or other instrumentality of interstate commerce to promote or further an animal fighting venture; and (4) buying, selling, delivering, or transporting sharp instruments for use in animal fighting venture. Someone who knowingly attends an animal flight can be fined or imprisoned for up to one year.

A US District Court and a US Appeals Court ruled that this statute was unconstitutional in U.S. v. Stevens. Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act 16 U.S.C. \u00a7668-668d (2008) This act creates both civil and criminal liability for knowingly, or with wanton disregard for the consequences, engaging in the taking, possessing, transporting, exporting, importing, selling, purchasing, bartering or offering to sell, purchase, or barter any American or golden eagle, alive or dead, or any part of a nest or egg. Furthermore, this act abrogates the right of Indian tribes to take bald and golden eagles for religious 283 purposes, so that such taking is illegal unless the Secretary of the Interior has determined that \"it is compatible with the preservation\" of the species. Depictions of Animal Cruelty 18 U.S.C. \u00a748 (2008) This statute criminalizes (felony) knowingly creating, selling, or possessing a depiction of animal cruelty (maiming, mutilating, torturing, wounding, or killing an animal if illegal under state or federal law) and intending to use the depiction for commercial gain in interstate or foreign commerce. However, depictions with \"serious religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value\" are exempt. A US District Court and a US Appeals Court ruled that this statute was unconstitutional in U.S. v. Stevens. The US Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in April 2009. Dog and Cat Protection Act of 2000 19 U.S.C. \u00a71308 (2008) This statute creates civil and criminal liabilities for importing or exporting any dog or cat fur product, introducing such products into interstate commerce, and advertising or offering to sell such products in interstate commerce. Endangered Species Act 16 U.S.C. \u00a71531-44 (2008) This act attempts to preserve species in recognition of their \"esthetic, ecological, educational, historical, recreational, and scientific value to the Nation.\" The act allows the Secretary of the Interior, and in some cases the Secretary of Commerce, to determine which species are threatened or endangered (\"any species which is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range\"), to designate the critical habitats of these species, and to create protective regulations and recovery plans. The Secretary of the Interior is generally charged with the establishment and implementation of recovery plans, although such duties fall to the Secretary of Agriculture with respect to the National Forest System. Such conservation measures could include land acquisition and management, while the act also generally prohibits the possession, transportation, delivery, or sell of threatened or endangered species in interstate or foreign commerce. Furthermore, the act requires the federal government to cooperate with the several states \"to the maximum extent practicable\" to conserve threatened and endangered species. Fair Housing Act 42 U.S.C. \u00a73604 (2008) This statute requires that all public and private housing (with exceptions) allow Seeing Eye dogs, even if the housing otherwise has a \"no pets\" policy. Federal Law Enforcement Animal Protection Act of 2000 18 U.S.C. \u00a71368 (2004). Federal Law Enforcement Animal Protection Act of 2000 18. U.S.C. \u00a71368 (2008) This statute criminalizes willful and malicious harm to any police animal, or any conspiracy or attempt to do the same. Such activity results in one year of imprisonment, unless the police animal suffers serious bodily injury, in which case the penalty is ten years of imprisonment. Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act 16 U.S.C. \u00a72901-12 (2008) This act focuses on nongame wildlife, which have been neglected because past programs focused instead on commercially important species. The act requires states to create detailed conservation plans for \"nongame fish and wildlife\" that must be approved by the Secretary of the Interior. The act also allots reimbursement to the states. 284 Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act 16 U.S.C. \u00a7661-667 (2008) This act authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to assist and cooperate with federal agencies and public and private organizations to develop, protect, rear, and stock all species of wildlife and to protect their habitats in order to control losses from disease and minimize the damage of overpopulation. Both the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the Department of the Interior must be consulted whenever a body of water is to be diverted in order to determine the possible losses and benefits to wildlife. The act also focuses on administering certain lands and wildlife refuges in order to conserve, maintain, and manage the wildlife thereon. Horse Protection Act 15 U.S.C. \u00a71821-31 (2008) Finding that \"the soring of horses is cruel and inhumane,\" this act prohibits shipping, delivering, receiving, selling, or showing a sore horse. A horse is considered sore if: a blistering, irritating, chemical, or other agent has been applied to any limb; any limb has been burned, cut, or lacerated; or a tack, screw, or nail has been injected into any limb. The act sets up an inspection system for horse shows, exhibitions, and auctions. The Secretary of Agriculture enforces this act. Common or contract carriers are exempt unless they had reason to believe that the horse that they carried was sore. Humane Slaughter Act 7 U.S.C. \u00a71901-1906 (2008) This act requires slaughter houses to employ humane techniques in the slaughter of cattle, calves, horses, mules, sheep, swine, and other livestock. A technique is considered to be humane if the animal is \"rendered insensible to pain by a single blow or gunshot or an electrical, chemical or other means that is rapid and effective.\" The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to foster research to develop new methods of humane slaughter. Religious slaughter, including the requisite handling or preparation of livestock for religious purposes, is exempted from this act. Lacy Act 18 U.S.C. \u00a741-49 (2008) This act prohibits hunting, trapping, disturbing, or injuring wildlife on any land set aside as a sanctuary, refugee, or breeding ground for that wildlife, while also prohibiting the destruction of U.S. property in such lands and waters. It also outlaws the importation of any species that the Secretary of the Interior has declared to be injurious to humans, agriculture, horticulture, or wildlife. The act prohibits polluting watering holes on public land for the purpose of trapping, killing, wounding, or maiming animals. It is also illegal to damage or interfere with the operation of an animal enterprise via interstate or foreign commerce or the mail. The act also refers to specific species, such as by prohibiting the transportation, delivery, sell, or purchase of water hyacinths and prohibiting the use of aircraft or motor vehicles to hunt, capture, or kill any wild and unbranded horse or burro. National Agricultural Research, Extension, 7 U.S.C. \u00a73191-3202 (2008) and Teaching Policy Act of 1977 This act promotes the general welfare through \"the improved health and productivity of domestic livestock, poultry, aquatic animals,\" and other animals essential to the food supply; improves horse health; facilitates effective treatment of animal and poultry diseases; improves ways to control organisms and residue in human food of animal origin; improves housing and management for well being of livestock; minimizes losses of livestock and poultry because of transportation; controls animal diseases to protect humans; improves animal birth control; and improves animal health and the general welfare of animals. 285 Sikes Act 16 U.S.C. \u00a7670a-670o (2008) This act authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and the head of each state's Fish and Wildlife Agency to enact conservation and rehabilitation programs for natural resources. The first part of the act describes such programs on military installations, with the cooperation of the Secretary of Defense, while the second part of the act creates similar programs on public lands. The act deals with issues such as hunting and the creation of recreational sites that provide access for disabled veterans. Tariff Act of 1930 19 U.S.C. \u00a71527 (2008) This section of the Tariff Act of 1930 prohibits importing into the United States any wild mammal or bird, alive or dead, or any part or product of any wild mammal or bird, if the laws or regulations of the wild mammal or bird's country of origin restrict its \"taking, killing, possession, or exportation to the United States,\" unless accompanied by a certification from the United States Consul that the mammal or bird \"has not been acquired or exported in violation of the laws of regulations of such country.\" Anything imported in violation of this statute is subject to seizure and forfeiture under customs laws. This statute excludes importation prohibited by any other law, items imported for science or education, and importation of certain migratory game birds brought into the country by sportspeople returning from hunting trips. Twenty-Eight Hour Law 49 U.S.C. \u00a780502 (2008) This law requires that animals being transported on any type of vehicle or vessel must not be confined for more than 28 consecutive hours without being unloaded for food, water, and rest. The law applies in interstate travel and travel between the U.S. and its territories and possessions. Sheep may be confined for as long as 36 consecutive hours. Animals may be confined for more than 28 hours if: unloading must be postponed due to accidental or unavoidable causes; or the custodian of the animals makes a written request for an extension to 36 hours. The law also makes an exception for animals that are transported in a way that provides food, water, space, and opportunities to rest. Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992 16 U.S.C. \u00a74901-4916 (2008) This act attempts to protect \"wild-caught exotic birds\" in order to meet international treaty obligations concerning endangered species and to respect and protect habitats in foreign nations. The United States assists conservation and management programs in the foreign nations that are points of origin for exotic birds. The act also limits or prohibits the importation of certain species of wild birds into the United States, while capture and transportation methods are monitored to insure that wild birds are treated humanely. 286 APPENDIX FOUR: TN Court System: Functions and Jurisdictions Tennessee Court System: When you file in State Court The great majority of legal disputes in American courts are handled in state courts. State courts have the exclusive power to exercise control over certain cases in certain geographical and subject areas. This power is known as jurisdiction. For example, state courts have jurisdiction over virtually all divorce and child custody matters, probate and inheritance issues, real estate questions, and juvenile matters. State courts also handle most criminal cases, contract disputes, traffic violations, and personal injury cases in the state of Tennessee. Tennessee Court System: How it Works (a) Courts of Limited Jurisdiction Courts of Limited Jurisdiction are funded at the county level and only can hear certain types of cases. Below are examples of Courts of Limited Jurisdiction: a. Juvenile Court handles cases dealing with juvenile mental health, paternity, and cases involving minors that are alleged to be delinquent, unruly, dependent, and neglected. If a county has no Juvenile Court, the General Sessions Court hears cases involving juveniles. In some cases, Juvenile Court may also have concurrent, or simultaneous, jurisdiction with Circuit, Chancery, and Probate Courts. This means that both the Juvenile and other courts have the ability to hear the same case. b. General Sessions Court deals with cases about mental health, preliminary hearings in civil matters, domestic relations, estate/probate, small claims, misdemeanors, Driving While Intoxicated/Driving Under the Influence, traffic, and some juvenile matters. This court's jurisdiction varies from county to county, depending on local ordinance. i. Civil Jurisdiction is restricted by certain monetary limits and types of actions determined by local ordinance. ii. Criminal Jurisdiction is limited to preliminary hearings in felony cases and trials in misdemeanor cases where the defendant waives the right to a grand jury investigation and a trial in either Circuit Court or Criminal Court. iii. Juvenile Jurisdiction cases are heard in General Sessions Court, except in those counties where the legislature has established a separate Juvenile Court. c. Municipal Court, or \"city court,\" hears minor criminal cases. Approximately three hundred Tennessee cities have a Municipal Court. A Municipal Court's jurisdiction is limited to violations of city ordinances, most commonly and traffic violations. Many crimes involving animals are heard by Municipal Courts. (b) Trial Courts The Tennessee state trial courts consist of the Probate Court, Chancery Court, Circuit Court, and Criminal Court. Tennessee's ninety-five counties are divided into thirty-one judicial districts. As provided in the state constitution, each judicial district contains a Circuit Court and Chancery Court. About one-third of the judicial districts feature specialized Criminal Courts, and a few districts have separate Probate Courts to handle wills and estates. Trial Courts are the lowest level of court review for most cases, but 287 some cases may begin in Courts of Limited Jurisdiction. (See Courts of Limited Jurisdiction, above.) a. Probate Court hears cases on estates, wills, conservatorships, and guardianships. These courts do not exist in every county. If a county does not have a Probate Court, these cases are handled in Circuit Court. b. Chancery Court hears domestic relations and civil cases. Generally, presiding Chancellors will hear and decide cases before the Chancery Court, but jury trials are available in certain cases. c. Circuit Court hears domestic relations, civil, and, in some jurisdictions, criminal cases. Circuit Courts also hear appeals from Courts of Limited Jurisdiction. d. Criminal Court hears only criminal cases. The Criminal Court also may hear misdemeanor appeals from lower courts. Criminal Courts do not exist in all Tennessee counties. In counties lacking a Criminal Court, the Circuit Court hears criminal cases at the trial level. (c) Intermediate Appellate Courts The Court of Appeals and Court of Criminal Appeals review civil and criminal decisions made by the Trial Courts. a. The Court of Appeals hears civil appeals. Additionally, the court holds oral argument in administrative agency, and juvenile appeals. Currently composed of twelve judges, the Court of Appeals hears most appeals of civil cases from lower courts. The Court of Appeals meets in Knoxville, Nashville, and Jackson. Normally, the Court of Appeals hears cases in panels of three judges. Because it is strictly an appellate body, the Court of Appeals does not take testimony or admit evidence. It merely reviews the records of lower courts to determine whether there is reversible error. In reviewing lower court proceedings, the Court of Appeals is guided by the briefs submitted by attorneys which appear before it to make arguments orally and answer questions from the judges. Like most court proceedings, these oral arguments are open to the public. Cases are decided in private conferences, but the court releases its decision to the public in the form of a written opinion. Decisions of the Court of Appeals may be appealed to the Tennessee Supreme Court, but that court hears appeals only at its discretion. Thus, the decision of the Court of Appeals is final in most instances. b. The Court of Criminal Appeals hears capital, criminal, and juvenile appeals. These matters include felony and misdemeanor convictions, as well as post conviction petitions. Composed of twelve judges, the Court of Criminal Appeals operates in essentially the same way as its civil counterpart (the Court of Appeals), but its jurisdiction is limited to criminal actions. (d) The Tennessee Supreme Court The Tennessee Supreme Court is the highest court in the state. The majority of the Supreme Court's caseload comes from appeals from lower state court decisions. Also known as the \"Court of Last Resort,\" the Tennessee Supreme Court consists of five justices who hear civil and criminal appeals. The Tennessee Supreme Court also has a special panel that hears only Worker's Compensation cases. The Tennessee Supreme 288 Court has the final word on all questions of state law. The state constitution requires that the Tennessee Supreme Court meet in Knoxville, Nashville, and Jackson. While sitting in each of these cities, the Tennessee Supreme Court hears appeals from its respective division of the state. The creation of the intermediate appellate courts to handle routine civil and criminal appeals has enabled the Tennessee Supreme Court to concentrate on the most important issues of state law. The only cases that may bypass the intermediate level are those in which the principal question is whether a state statute or a local ordinance is constitutional. There is often a special need for a speedy decision in cases involving state taxes, the right to hold or retain public office, or issues of constitutional law. In such cases, the Tennessee Supreme Court may decide to hear a case even without a decision by the Court of Appeals as long as one of the parties to the case requests Tennessee Supreme Court review. The only cases in which the Tennessee Supreme Court must grant review are those involving the death penalty, disciplinary actions against attorneys, and tenure of teachers. Thus, for the most part, the Tennessee Supreme Court has control over its agenda. In addition to supervising how other judges interpret state law, the Tennessee Supreme Court plays an important role in supervising the administration of the state court system. To this end, the Tennessee Supreme Court determines the rules of procedure for itself and all the other state courts. 289 APPENDIX FIVE: Tennessee Sentencing Guidelines The Tennessee Sentencing Guidelines consist of statutes and related comments that help judges decide what sentences to give defendants if they are found guilty in a Tennessee court of law. Sections of the Tennessee Sentencing Commission's Comments have been included only where the Editors deemed them necessary. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a740-35-101 (2008): Short Title This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the \"Tennessee Criminal Sentencing Reform Act of 1989.\" SENTENCING COMMISSION COMMENTS: . . . [A]ll felony offenses are classified based on severity of offense with letter designations: the most serious felonies graded as Class A and the least serious as Class E. Misdemeanors are similarly graded. The substantive criminal code revision sets forth the class of each felony or misdemeanor based on the nature of the offense. One attribute of this classification system is to treat like offenses the same for punishment purposes. Thus, all theft and theft related offenses are \"graded\" based on the amount of property taken. The classification of offenses also permits the construction of a sentencing grid so that the potential sentence for each offender can be rapidly ascertained. Each felony class carries a maximum and minimum sentence. Thus, a Class A felony can be punished from between 15 and 60 years. See \u00a740-35-112. The 15 to 60 year span is divided into three ranges called Range I, Range II and Range III. The \"range\" determination is based upon the number of prior convictions which, in turn, determines the potential span for that particular offender. Thus, a Range I sentence for a Class A felony is 15 to 25 years. A Range II sentence for a Class A felony is 25 to 40 years, and a Range III sentence is from 40 to 60 years. . . Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a740-35-102 (2008): Purpose of chapter The foremost purpose of this chapter is to promote justice, as manifested by \u00a7 40-35-103. In so doing, the following principles are adopted: (1) Every defendant shall be punished by the imposition of a sentence justly deserved in relation to the seriousness of the offense; (2) This chapter is to assure fair and consistent treatment of all defendants by eliminating unjustified disparity in sentencing and providing a fair sense of predictability of the criminal law and its sanctions; (3) Punishment shall be imposed to prevent crime and promote respect for the law by: (A) Providing an effective general deterrent to those likely to violate the criminal laws of this state; (B) Restraining defendants with a lengthy history of criminal conduct; (C) Encouraging effective rehabilitation of those defendants, where reasonably feasible, by promoting the use of alternative sentencing and correctional programs that elicit voluntary cooperation of defendants; and (D) Encouraging restitution to victims where appropriate; (4) Sentencing should exclude all considerations respecting race, gender, creed, religion, national origin and social status of the individual; (5) In recognition that state prison capacities and the funds to build and maintain them are limited, convicted felons committing the most severe offenses, possessing criminal histories evincing a clear disregard for the laws and morals of society and evincing failure of past efforts at rehabilitation shall be given first priority regarding 290 sentencing involving incarceration; and (6) (A) A defendant who does not fall within the parameters of subdivision (5), and who is an especially mitigated or standard offender convicted of a Class C, D or E felony, should be considered as a favorable candidate for alternative sentencing options in the absence of evidence to the contrary; however, a defendant's prior convictions shall be considered evidence to the contrary and, therefore, a defendant who is being sentenced for a third or subsequent felony conviction involving separate periods of incarceration or supervision shall not be considered a favorable candidate for alternative sentencing; (B) As used in subdivision (6)(A), \"separate periods of incarceration or supervision\" means that the defendant serves and is released or discharged from a period of incarceration or supervision for the commission of a felony prior to committing another felony; (C) If a defendant with at least three (3) felony convictions is otherwise eligible, that defendant may still be considered a favorable candidate for any alternative sentencing that is within the jurisdiction of and deemed appropriate by a drug court; (D) A court shall consider, but is not bound by, the advisory sentencing guideline in this subdivision (6). Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a740-35-103 (2008): Sentencing considerations To implement the purposes of this chapter, the following principles apply: (1) Sentences involving confinement should be based on the following considerations: (A) Confinement is necessary to protect society by restraining a defendant who has a long history of criminal conduct; (B) Confinement is necessary to avoid depreciating the seriousness of the offense or confinement is particularly suited to provide an effective deterrence to others likely to commit similar offenses; or (C) Measures less restrictive than confinement have frequently or recently been applied unsuccessfully to the defendant; (2) The sentence imposed should be no greater than that deserved for the offense committed; (3) Inequalities in sentences that are unrelated to a purpose of this chapter should be avoided; (4) The sentence imposed should be the least severe measure necessary to achieve the purposes for which the sentence is imposed; (5) The potential or lack of potential for the rehabilitation or treatment of the defendant should be considered in determining the sentence alternative or length of a term to be imposed. The length of a term of probation may reflect the length of a treatment or rehabilitation program in which participation is a condition of the sentence; (6) Trial judges are encouraged to use alternatives to incarceration that include requirements of reparation, victim compensation, community service or all of these; and (7) Available community-based alternatives to confinement and the benefits that imposing such alternatives may provide to the community should be considered when the offense is nonviolent and the defendant is the primary caregiver of a dependent child. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a740-35-104 (2008): Sentencing alternatives (a) A defendant convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor in this state shall be sentenced in accordance with this chapter. 291 (b) (1) A defendant who is convicted of a felony after November 1, 1989, and who is sentenced to a total sentence of at least one (1) year but not more than three (3) years, shall not be sentenced to serve the sentence in the department of correction, if the legislative body for the county from which the defendant is being sentenced has either contracted with the department, or has passed a resolution that expresses an intent to contract for the purpose of housing convicted felons with such sentences. If the sentencing court concludes that incarceration is the appropriate sentencing alternative, the defendant must be sentenced to the local jail or workhouse and not to the department. (2) A defendant who is convicted of a felony after November 1, 1989, and who is sentenced to at least one (1) year but not more than six (6) years, shall not be sentenced to serve the sentence in the department of correction if the defendant is being sentenced from a county with a population of not less than four hundred seventy-seven thousand eight hundred eleven (477,811), according to the 1980 federal census or any subsequent federal census, and the legislative body for the county has contracted with the department or has passed a resolution that expresses an intent to contract for the purpose of housing convicted felons with such sentences. If the sentencing court concludes that incarceration is the appropriate sentencing alternative, the defendant must be sentenced to the local jail or workhouse and not to the department. (c) The following sentencing alternatives in any appropriate combination are authorized for defendants otherwise eligible under this chapter: (1) Payment of a fine either alone or in addition to any other sentence authorized by this subsection (c); (2) Payment of restitution to the victim or victims either alone or in addition to any other sentence authorized by this subsection (c); (3) A sentence of confinement that is suspended upon a term of probation supervision that may include community service or restitution, or both; (4) A sentence of periodic confinement that may be served in a local jail or workhouse in conjunction with a term of probation; (5) A sentence of continuous confinement to be served in a local jail or workhouse in conjunction with a term of probation; (6) A sentence of continuous confinement in a local jail or workhouse; (7) Work release in accordance with \u00a7 40-35-315; (8) A sentence of continuous confinement in the department of correction if the conviction is for a felony and the sentence is at least one (1) year, unless: (A) The sentence is prohibited by subsection (b); or (B) The defendant is convicted of a violation of \u00a7 39-14-103, involving property valued at less than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500), and the defendant is sentenced as an especially mitigated offender as defined in \u00a7 40-35-109 or a standard offender as defined in \u00a7 40-35-105; or (9) A community-based alternative to incarceration as a condition of probation, such as participation in a day reporting center program, a recovery and treatment program, or another appropriate community-based program. A defendant may be ordered to participate in a recovery and treatment program only if such a program is indicated by the results of a clinical assessment. (d) This chapter does not deprive a court of any authority conferred by law, including, but not limited to, \u00a7 40-35-313, to decree a forfeiture of property, suspend or cancel a license, remove a person from office or impose costs and other monetary obligations if specifically authorized by law. 292 (e) This chapter does not prevent a court from imposing a sentence of death specifically authorized by law. (f) The court shall strongly consider utilizing available and appropriate sentencing alternatives for any defendant who, as appropriately documented, including through a validated risk and needs assessment under \u00a7 40-35-207(a)(10), has a behavioral health need, such as a mental illness as defined in \u00a7 33-1-101, or is chemically dependent as defined in \u00a7 16-22-103. The court has sole discretion whether to utilize available sentencing alternatives under this subsection (f). Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a740-35-110 (2008): Classification of offenses (a) Felonies are classified, for the purpose of sentencing, into five (5) categories: (1) Class A felonies; (2) Class B felonies; (3) Class C felonies; (4) Class D felonies; and (5) Class E felonies. (b) An offense designated a felony without specification as to category is a Class E felony. (c) Misdemeanors are classified, for the purpose of sentencing, into three (3) categories: (1) Class A misdemeanors; (2) Class B misdemeanors; and (3) Class C misdemeanors. (d) An offense designated as a misdemeanor without specification as to category is a Class A misdemeanor. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a740-35-111: Authorized terms of imprisonment and fines for felonies and misdemeanors (a) A sentence for a felony is a determinate sentence. (b) The authorized terms of imprisonment and fines for felonies are: (1) Class A felony, not less than fifteen (15) nor more than sixty (60) years.

(d) A sentence for a misdemeanor is a determinate sentence. (e) The authorized terms of imprisonment and fines for misdemeanors are: (1) Class A misdemeanor, not greater than eleven (11) months, twenty-nine (29) days or a fine not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500), or both, unless otherwise provided by statute; (2) Class B misdemeanor, not greater than six (6) months or a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500), or both, unless otherwise provided by statute; and (3) Class C misdemeanor, not greater than thirty (30) days or a fine not to exceed fifty dollars ($50.00), or both, unless otherwise provided by statute.

after July 1, 1982, and prior to November 1, 1989, except first degree murder, which shall be punished by death or life imprisonment. SENTENCING COMMISSION COMMENTS This section classifies felony offenses in title 39 which were in existence prior to November 1, 1989. This classification of prior offenses serves two purposes. First, prior felonies are used to determine whether and to what extent a defendant's sentence should be enhanced. Since felonies have only recently been classified, this section designates the appropriate grade of the pre-November 1, 1989 conviction for purposes of the classification determination. For example, if a defendant is convicted of aggravated arson and has pre-November 1, 1989 convictions for second degree murder and aggravated rape, it is necessary to ascertain the classification of those prior convictions to determine whether the defendant's aggravated arson sentence can be enhanced into Range II or Range III. Second degree murder and aggravated rape are 303 classified as Class A felonies. Under the criteria for sentencing as a persistent offender in \u00a7 40-35-107, the defendant must receive a Range III sentence. Second, persons sentenced on or after November 1, 1989, for an offense committed between July 1, 1982 and November 1, 1989, must be sentenced under the provisions of this chapter. See, \u00a7 40-35-117(b). The new definitions and classifications cannot be utilized for offenses which occurred prior to November 1, 1989, because, in many instances, the elements of the offense are completely different. Consequently, except for first degree murder pursuant to \u00a7 39-11-117(b), this section sets forth the felony classification which is to be utilized for those offenses which occurred prior to November 1, 1989, when the sentencing takes place after that date. For example, if a defendant is convicted for the offense of first degree burglary which occurred prior to November 1, 1989, but the defendant is sentenced after that date, then this table of classification discloses that first degree burglary is punished as a Class C felony. As noted in \u00a7 40- 35-111(b)(3), a Class C felony carries a sentence of not less than 3 nor more than 15 years. The precise sentence within that classification depends on the defendant's prior record which determines whether the defendant will be sentenced within Range I, II, or III. The classification of prior offenses in this section determines sentencing for those offenses which were in existence prior to November 1, 1989, as set forth in title 39. It should be noted, however, that first degree murder is classified as a Class A felony in this section. However, pursuant to \u00a7 39-11-117(b), this classification is only utilized where the first degree murder conviction is part of the prior record of a defendant being sentenced for a subsequent offense. In all instances, both prior to November 1, 1989, and after that date, first degree murder is punished as a capital offense. The offenses contained in titles other than title 39 have been amended directly by altering the punishment with specified felony or misdemeanor classifications. Since the elements of those offenses have not been changed, the punishment for those offenses can be ascertained by referring directly to the particular statute itself. These classifications shall be used for sentencing after November 1, 1989, if the offense was committed on or after July 1, 1982, and prior to November 1, 1989, except first degree murder, which shall be punished by death or life imprisonment. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a740-35-119 (2008): Classification of prior unclassified felony offenses Any prior felony offense committed between July 1, 1982, and November 1, 1989, which has not been classified pursuant to \u00a7 40-35-118 or otherwise, is a Class E felony. 304 MITIGATING FACTORS The following statutes detail how a sentence may be reduced due to circumstances making a crime less severe. The statutes also explain who may have his or her sentences reduced. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a740-34-108: Maximum reduction of sentence (a) (1) (A) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, no sentence credits authorized by \u00a7 41-21-236 or any other provision of law, or no sentence contract authorized by this chapter or any other provision of law shall have the effect of reducing the amount of time an inmate must serve before the inmate's earliest release eligibility date, undiminished by the sentence credits, by more than thirty-five percent (35%). (B) For inmates sentenced for offenses committed on or after January 1, 1988, no sentence credits or no sentence contract shall have the effect of reducing the amount of time an inmate must serve before the inmate's earliest release eligibility date, undiminished by the sentence credits, by more than thirty percent (30%). (2) The sentencing commission shall review the effect of these provisions as part of its duties under law. (b) As used in this section, \"sentence credits\" includes any credit, whether called such or not, that results in a reduction of the amount of time an inmate must serve on the original sentence or sentences. This section shall not be applicable when the powers granted pursuant to title 41, chapter 1 are in effect to reduce prison overcrowding. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a740-35-109: Especially mitigated offender (a) The court may find the defendant is an especially mitigated offender, if: (1) The defendant has no prior felony convictions; and (2) The court finds mitigating, but no enhancement factors. (b) If the court finds the defendant an especially mitigated offender, the court shall reduce the defendant's statutory Range I minimum sentence by ten percent (10%), or reduce the release eligibility date to twenty percent (20%) of the sentence, or both reductions. If the court employs both reductions, the calculation for release eligibility shall be made by first reducing the sentence and then reducing the release eligibility to twenty percent (20%). (c) If the defendant is found to be an especially mitigated offender, the judgment of conviction shall so reflect. (d) The finding that a defendant is or is not an especially mitigated offender is appealable by either party. SENTENCING COMMISSION COMMENTS: As noted in the comments to \u00a7 40-35-101, sentences have been divided into one of three ranges. The sentencing ranges are governed by the presence or absence of prior convictions. If a defendant has little or no prior criminal record, such defendant would normally be sentenced within Range I as a standard offender. See \u00a7 40-35-105. However, there are instances where the trial judge may desire to depart from even the minimum sentence for a Range I offender and impose lesser penalties. In such instances, the judge may designate the defendant as an \"especially mitigated offender\" under the provisions of this section. If the judge designates the defendant for this category, the judge has the option of reducing the minimum sentence by 10 percent or reducing the release eligibility date to 20 percent or both options. [. . .] 305 Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a740-35-113 (2008): Mitigating factors If appropriate for the offense, mitigating factors may include, but are not limited to: (1) The defendant's criminal conduct neither caused nor threatened serious bodily injury; (2) The defendant acted under strong provocation; (3) Substantial grounds exist tending to excuse or justify the defendant's criminal conduct, though failing to establish a defense; (4) The defendant played a minor role in the commission of the offense; (5) Before detection, the defendant compensated or made a good faith attempt to compensate the victim of criminal conduct for the damage or injury the victim sustained; (6) The defendant, because of youth or old age, lacked substantial judgment in committing the offense; (7) The defendant was motivated by a desire to provide necessities for the defendant's family or the defendant's self; (8) The defendant was suffering from a mental or physical condition that significantly reduced the defendant's culpability for the offense; however, the voluntary use of intoxicants does not fall within the purview of this factor; (9) The defendant assisted the authorities in uncovering offenses committed by other persons or in detecting or apprehending other persons who had committed the offenses; (10) The defendant assisted the authorities in locating or recovering any property or person involved in the crime; (11) The defendant, although guilty of the crime, committed the offense under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely that a sustained intent to violate the law motivated the criminal conduct; (12) The defendant acted under duress or under the domination of another person, even though the duress or the domination of another person is not sufficient to constitute a defense to the crime; and (13) Any other factor consistent with the purposes of this chapter. SENTENCING COMMISSION COMMENTS: [. . .] It should be observed that the list is not exclusive and the final portion of this section provides that the trial judge may consider \"any other factor consistent with the purposes of this chapter.\" There has been a tendency to perceive mitigating factors as \"statutory\" and \"non-statutory\" in the sense that the latter are somehow of less significance than the former. The commission believes that appropriate sentencing determinations should be made on the basis of all relevant information presented to the trial judge. [. . .] ENHANCEMENT FACTORS The following statutes define and categorize certain offenders for the purposes of sentencing. Generally, the more often the person breaks the law, the longer the sentence. If the enhancement factors are especially severe, bail may be revoked. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a740-35-105 (2008): Standard offender (a) A \"standard offender\" is a defendant not sentenced as: (1) A multiple offender, as defined by \u00a7 40-35-106; (2) A persistent offender, as defined by \u00a7 40-35-107; (3) A career offender, as defined by \u00a7 40-35-108; (4) An especially mitigated offender, as defined by \u00a7 40-35-109; or (5) A repeat violent offender, as defined by \u00a7 40-35-120. 306 (b) The sentence for a standard offender is within Range I.

In the event that a felony from a jurisdiction other than Tennessee is not a named felony in this state, the elements of the offense shall be used by the Tennessee court to determine what classification the offense is given. (c) A defendant who is found by the court beyond a reasonable doubt to be a multiple offender shall receive a sentence within Range II.

(c) A defendant who is found by the court beyond a reasonable doubt to be a persistent offender shall receive a sentence within Range III.

(2) For purposes of subdivision (a)(6), the offenses that were repealed on November 1, 1989, and are listed in \u00a7 40-35-118(a) as Class A or B felonies against a person, with the exception of the offense of robbery by use of a deadly weapon, are classified as violent offenses. (e) In determining the number of prior convictions a defendant has received: (1) \"Prior conviction\" means a defendant serves and is released from a period of incarceration for the commission of an offense or offenses so that a defendant must: (A) To qualify under subdivision (a)(1) and (a)(2), have served two (2) separate periods of incarceration for the commission of at least two (2) of the predicate offenses designated in subdivision (b)(1) or (b)(2) before committing an offense designated in subdivision (b)(1); (B) To qualify under subdivision (a)(3) and (a)(4), at least one (1) separate period of incarceration for the commission of a predicate offense designated in subdivision (c)(1) or (c)(2) before committing an offense designated in subdivision (c)(1); or (C) To qualify under subdivision (a)(5) and (a)(6), at least one (1) separate period of incarceration for the commission of a predicate offense designated in subdivision (d)(1) or (d)(2), with the exception of the prior offense of robbery by use of a deadly weapon as listed in \u00a7 40-35-118(a), before committing an offense designated in subdivision (d)(1); (2) \"Separate period of incarceration\" includes a sentence to a community correction program pursuant to chapter 36 of this title, a sentence to split confinement pursuant to \u00a7 40-35-306 or a sentence to a periodic confinement pursuant to \u00a7 40-35-307. Any offense designated as a violent offense pursuant to subsection (b), (c) or (d) that is committed while incarcerated or committed while the prisoner is assigned to a program whereby the prisoner enjoys the privilege of supervised release into the community, including, but not limited to, work release, educational release, restitution release, medical furlough or that is committed while on escape status from any correctional institution shall be considered as a separate period of incarceration; (3) A finding or adjudication that a defendant committed an act as a juvenile that is designated a predicate offense under subsection (b), (c) or (d) if committed by an adult, and that resulted in a transfer of the juvenile to criminal court pursuant to \u00a7 37-1-134, or similar statutes of other states or jurisdictions, shall not be considered a prior conviction for the purposes of this section unless the juvenile was convicted of the predicate offense in a criminal court and sentenced to confinement in the department of correction; and (4) \"Prior convictions\" include convictions under the laws of any other state, government or country that, if committed in this state, would have constituted a predicate offense in subsection (b), (c) or (d) if there are separate periods of incarceration in the other state as required by subdivision (e)(1). If a felony from a jurisdiction other than Tennessee is not a named predicate offense specified in subsection (b), (c) or (d) in this state and if the elements of the felony are the same as a designated predicate offense, it shall be considered a prior conviction; provided, that there are separate periods of incarceration in the other state as required in subdivision (e)(1). 314 (f) The court shall refuse to accept a plea agreement that fails to recommend that a defendant with a sufficient number of designated prior convictions be sentenced as a repeat violent offender. If the judge refuses to accept the plea agreement, this does not prevent the district attorney general, in accordance with Rule 7 of the Tennessee Rules of Criminal Procedure, from amending the indicted offense to an offense that is not designated as a violent offense in subsection (b) or (c). (g) The court shall sentence a defendant who has been convicted of any offense listed in subdivision (b)(1), (c)(1) or (d)(1) to imprisonment for life without possibility of parole if the court finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is a repeat violent offender as defined in subsection (a). (h) The finding that a defendant is or is not a repeat violent offender is appealable by either party. (i) (1) (A) A charge as a repeat violent offender shall be tried within one hundred eighty (180) days of the arraignment on the indictment pursuant to Rule 10 of the Tennessee Rules of Criminal Procedure unless delay is caused by: (i) The defendant; (ii) An examination for competency; (iii) A competency hearing; (iv) An adjudication of incompetency for trial; (v) A continuance allowed after a court's determination of the defendant's physical incapacity for a trial; or (vi) An interlocutory appeal. (B) A continuance may be granted to any party, including the court, for good cause shown. (2) The district attorney general shall file a statement with the court and the defense counsel within forty-five (45) days of the arraignment pursuant to Rule 10 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure that the defendant is a repeat violent offender. The statement, which shall not be made known to the jury determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant, shall set forth the dates of the prior periods of incarceration, as well as the nature of the prior conviction offenses. If the notice is not filed within forty-five (45) days of the arraignment, the defendant shall be granted a continuance so that the defendant will have forty-five (45) days between receipt of notice and trial. (3) Failure to comply with this subsection (i) does not require release of a person from custody or a dismissal of charges. SPECIAL OFFENSES Many times, the Sentencing Commission will set out special punishments for crimes it considers especially offensive or problematic, such as gang activity. Knowledge of this information may be useful if, for instance, the person involved in an animal crime is also a member of a gang and has prior such offenses that may or may not involve animals. In this case, a harsher punishment than that originally available may be sought. 315 Tenn.

Smith, University of Tennessee College of Law, Candidate for J.D., Class of 2010 Brehann E. Eldridge, Accredited Pet Trainer, University of Tennessee College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources, Candidate for B.S., Animal Science, Class of 2009 Introduction The controversies surrounding animal fighting are in no way new to the state of Tennessee. In order to appreciate how far reaching an impact there may be, it is important to consider the history underlying this issue. Understanding exactly what animal fighting means to the people and animals involved is also imperative. Over the next few pages, this article will attempt to shed light on animal fighting. In addition to providing background and a legal perspective, proposals will be presented for consideration in an attempt to solve Tennessee's current issues. Although many issues affecting fighting animals are the same, there are distinct issues that vary between fighting cocks and dogs. For this reason, these two common species will be presented separately at times. Cockfighting: A Brief Explanation Cockfighting is described by The Humane Society of the United States as \"a centuries- old blood sport in which two or more specially bred birds, known as gamecocks, are placed in an enclosure to fight, for the primary purposes of gambling and entertainment. The fights can last over half an hour and often result in the death of one, if not both, of the birds involved.1 Even birds that are not killed in the course of the fight suffer extreme pain and injuries. Punctured lungs, broken bones, and gouged eyes are not uncommon in the ring.2 Many of these injuries are the result of gaffs, steel spikes affixed to the birds' legs to cause extra damage.3 The harm caused by cockfighting extends beyond the birds. Law enforcement officials have linked cockfighting rings to gambling and illegal drugs.4 It is especially disturbing to note that young children are often present at these fights, engendering a conception of animals as worthless and insignificant.5 Although cockfighting has long been part of many cultures, this cultural importance can often be overplayed. In a 1997 survey conducted in Arizona, only 34% of Anglos disagreed that \"cockfighting is an important part of Hispanic culture.\" Conversely, 70% of Hispanics disagreed with the statement.6 Additionally, 95% of Hispanics polled felt that cockfighting was \"cruel and inhumane.\"7 This survey demonstrates a clear misunderstanding in the cultural value of cockfighting but may also represent an inherent prejudice. Latin cultures are not the only ones with a 1 Id. 2 Id. 3 Id. 4 Id. 5 Id. 6 www.idausa.org/campaigns/sport/cock/cockfighting.html 7 Id. 319 reputation for cockfighting. Culture within the Southeastern United States also reflects the presence of such events. The most obvious sign may be the fact that the University of South Carolina still uses the gamecock as its mascot. Cockfighting is currently a criminal offense in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Severity of punishment differs widely from state to state. Some states provide for punishment of cockfighting, possession of birds for fighting, being present as a spectator at a fight, and possession of implements used for cockfighting all as felonies. Other states view some of these as misdemeanors, including cockfighting itself. Hawaii, Georgia, Idaho, Mississippi, and Alabama consider cockfighting the only crime in the list above.8 The state of Tennessee considers cockfighting a Class A Misdemeanor, although this may soon be changing as discussed later in the article. Dog Fighting: A Brief Explanation Dog fighting is similar in many respects to cockfighting. Two dogs, most frequently Pit Bulls, are placed in a ring and made to fight until one is unable to continue. These fights often result in serious injury and/or death. Even if the losing dog is not killed, they are often shot or abandoned by their owners.9 Even winning dogs frequently suffer severe damage to their eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. Dogs that are seen as \"useless\" because of the injuries they have suffered are also shot, abandoned, or otherwise disposed of. Like cockfighting, dog fighting is also linked to gambling rings and illegal drugs. Fights provide ample opportunity for such activities to take place in a secluded, often secretive environment. There have also been links between dog fighting and street gang activities, a major issue in large urban areas.10 Although dog fighting does not share as many of the long-standing cultural influences of cockfighting, it is slowly being popularized within American pop culture. This connection seems especially true with the culture surrounding rap music. Jay-Z's video for \"99 Problems\" contains images associated with dog fighting.11 His video is not the only example. Artist DMX named his album, Grand Champ, in honor of fighting dogs.12 The cover of the album portrays a Pit Bull showing marked signs of aggression. DMX had previously pled guilty to animal cruelty charges stemming from 13 neglected Pit Bulls in his possession.13 Dog fighting is currently a felony in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Like cockfighting, severity of punishments varies widely between individual states. Although all states treat dog fighting as a crime, being a spectator to a fight or possession of dogs meant for fighting might be a misdemeanor or legal altogether. Both Montana and Hawaii provide no punishment for being a spectator at a dog fight.14 Tennessee provides for punishment of dog fighting and possession of fighting dogs as a Class E Felony, but being a spectator is defined as merely a Class C Misdemeanor, the lowest classification in Tennessee's statutory system. 8 www.hsus.org/web-files/PDF/cockfighting_statelaws.pdf 9 www.hsus.org/acf/fighting/dogfight/ 10 www.animalsheltering.org/resource_library/magazine_articles/jul_aug_2006/dogfighting_investigations_where_we_ stand.html 11 http://www.hsus.org/acf/news/jay-z_dogfighting.html 12 Id. 13 Id. 14 www.hsus.org/acf/fighting/dogfight/ranking_state_dogfighting_laws.html 320 Why Can't We Stop Animal Fighting Now? One of the most glaring issues in animal fighting today is the lack of prosecutions taking place in Tennessee. This is true in spite of the fact that animal fighting incidents are on the rise in rural and urban areas alike.15 There are several problems, both social and political in nature, that have contributed to this problem. One major problem with regulation within the state of Tennessee involves the inability of humane officers to effectively carry out their duties. Although Tennessee does provide these officers with the ability to intervene in crimes and arrest perpetrators, they are made to do this without the benefit of being armed.16 As previously stated, animal fighting is linked to illegal gambling, drug distribution, and gang activity. Because of these connections, participants in animal fighting are often dangerous criminals in other respects. To deprive humane officers of the protection or force needed to affect such arrests is to effectively negate all their powers. Another major obstacle to enforcement rests in the laws themselves. Criminal statutes relating to animal fighting vary widely from state to state. This causes not only confusion among citizens and law enforcement officials, but it also provides criminally-minded individuals with an opportunity to circumvent unfavorable laws. These issues frequently occur within an individual state as well. In Tennessee, dog fighting is punished as a Class E Felony.17 Sentencing guidelines provide that this sort of crime should be punished with a prison sentence of not less than 1 year.18 In contrast, cockfighting is considered a Class A Misdemeanor, one step lower in Tennessee's statutory scheme than dog fighting.19 Consequently, cockfighting does not carry as harsh a punishment.20 Beyond this, crimes such as being a spectator at such a fight, possession of fighting animals, or possession of implements carry even lower criminal penalties.21 These relatively low penalties pose another problem for enforcement. Large sums of money, often in the tens of thousands range, can change hands during animal fighting events.22 Because the fines, sentences, and enforcement related to animal fighting laws are relatively low, individuals are provided with the possibility of a high reward for very little risk. Just for perspective, stealing an equivalent amount of money could be as high as a Class B Felony, some three classifications higher than the highest classification for any type of animal fighting found in Tenn. Code Ann. 39-14-203.23 The Impact Does Not End With Injured Animals The consequences of animal fighting extend beyond the physical injuries suffered by the animals. As previously cited, animal fighting rings have been linked with illegal gambling, drugs, and gang activity.24 Despite the inherent evil posed by fighting animals, these effects are equally as disturbing. Fighting rings circulate large sums of 15 www.hsus.org/hsus_field/animal_fighting_the_final_round/ 16 Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-14-210 17 Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-14-203(c)(1) 18 Tenn.

Code Ann. \u00a7 39-14-105 24 Supra notes 5,11 321 money that help to fund these other illegal activities. This helps to create a subculture were violence, animal cruelty, drug use, and moral complacency are readily accepted. Animal fighting also has other effects on the animals involved. This is seen most commonly with the Pit Bulls that are a favorite of dog fighters. Pit Bulls have suffered physical pain in the ring and severe damage to their reputation within the community. They are often thought of as overly aggressive, which has led to two distinct problems for the breed. One serious issue with Pit Bulls, namely those who were previously fighting dogs, is that they are difficult to place for adoption with humane services. These animals have often been so rigorously trained to fight that they are rendered incapable of normal social behavior. This frequently leads to these animals being put down. This is not always the case thankfully. In the recently publicized case of Michael Vick, only one of the 47 surviving dogs was euthanized.25 This was the result of the judge ruling that all the dogs should be evaluated individually, in the face of expert opinion that they should all be put down.26 Another serious problem arising from dog fighting that is currently affecting Tennessee is the proposal of so-called \"Dangerous Dog Laws.\" These laws typically ban the possession and/or breeding of a certain breed of dog, almost always including the aforementioned Pit Bull. Although these laws criminalize the possession of dogs used for fighting, they also limit the freedom of dog owners who wish to own one of the breeds merely for pleasure and companionship. It is farfetched to believe these ordinances would have any effect of dog fighting. Fighting is itself a criminal offense of a more severe nature that possession. There is also the same issue of enforcement and prosecution by the state that limits the effectiveness of current animal fighting statutes. There may also be some disparate impact on other pet owners. Theft of dogs, cats, and other small pets is a common practice amongst dog fighters.27 These animals are used as \"bait\" to assist in training the dogs to kill another animal. The frequency of these financial and emotional losses is hard to estimate accurately. What Are We Doing To Make a Change? There are efforts being made locally and nationally to stop animal fighting. Many of the major national organizations, such as the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) and the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), have organized programs to raise awareness of dog fighting. These organizations also provide information to people willing to volunteer their time and money to stop such atrocities. More information can be found by visiting the websites of these organizations at www.aspca.org and www.hsus.org respectively. On a local level, the Tennessee legislature is considering a bill that would raise cockfighting to a felony offense.28 Although this increase in penalty is admirable, a 25 Id. 26 Id. 27 Id. 322 closer look at the bill might reveal that it still will not meet the need. This proposed legislation merely increases fines, without providing for prison sentences in association with cockfighting.29 As previously mentioned, the amount of money involved in cockfighting renders fines nearly useless, unless they are of such an extreme amount to serve as an actual deterrent. A Final Word Although steps have been made through education, legislations, and enforcement to limit the impact of animal fighting, there is still work to do. The ASPCA and HSUS can only do so much without the assistance of volunteers.
