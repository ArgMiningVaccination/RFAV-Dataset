She has been attuned as a reiki master level 2 from Northwest Healing Studio as well as completed her 8 month Reiki Intuitive energy healing mentorship and level 3 Reiki master training and attunement. She has been on the journey of intuitive healing and processing for years. A healing session can be strictly silent hands on energy healing or it can be more an emotional talk therapy session with intuitive hands on healing as needed. She uses all her facets to create and hold space for the client. Her passion is to reignite the spark within every client and to empower and lift the vibrations and energy of each one she touches. She believes everyone has the innate ability to radiate and function at their highest good and her intention is to help usher that in. She feels strongly that each parent and family can feel empowered in their role given the right tools, knowledge, and support. Her passion is rooted in her deep respect and belief in the way of all the ancestors that did this work for centuries before and the ideology that it takes a village. After having her own postpartum doula practice she is thrilled to be joining the Glow family of practitioners to more fully build each client's \"village\". In working alongside all the practitioners at Glow she is confident that it provides a safety net of all the components of care and an integrated approach that is rare to find in the postpartum period and the health care system.

She was an early childhood educator for many years and has worked with infants through toddlerhood and their families for the last 15 years. She has a holistic approach and likes to meet her clients where they are and support them in whatever way they need. She brings all her knowledge to the table and pulls from the parts that seem to be most beneficial and relevant to the client. Rachel was born in San Francisco,raised in Seattle and lived in LA and NY. She now calls Seattle her home where she lives with her partner, children and two dogs. When not with clients you can find her trying to snuggle her \"not-so-baby-babies\", doing barre, meditating, reading, watering her plants, eating an abundance of kale and kimchi and trying with limited success to read her partner his horoscope.

I am a graduate of the State University of New York at Buffalo's School of Social Work, where I earned my Master's of Social Work (MSW) degree. I have developed a breadth of experience from hospital employment that included medical case management, dialysis care, inpatient psychiatric and chemical dependency treatment, and outpatient mental health counseling, as well as from Community College counseling, where I provided academic, career and personal counseling to the students and faculty. My Approach My approach to therapy is holistic, from a Strengths-Based, Mindful perspective, acknowledging that all people have strengths - often untapped or unrecognized. Strengths-Based Social Work practice is an empowering alternative to traditional therapies. Traditional psychotherapy more often defines an individual's poor functioning in terms of psychiatric diagnoses. My approach, in collaboration with the patient, is to uncover or rediscover the patient's own abilities. I view my patients as resourceful and resilient in the face of adversity, and empower them to be active participants in the healing process. My work is informed by and grounded in Transpersonal Social Work Theory (Body and Spirit), and reflects my professional training in Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, Reality Therapy, Family Systems, Mindfulness, and Body Awareness. I have a special interest in Integrative Mental Health (our brains are not separate from our bodies!). I work with all individuals struggling with chronic illness and pain, depression and anxiety, as well as those overwhelmed by transitions in life, but I have a particular personal interest in supporting and managing the stress and anxiety associated with fertility issues by employing a mindfulness approach. More About Tina I joined the staff at Glow Natural Health Center in November 2009 when my husband, our pets, and I took on the challenge of uprooting ourselves from our home in New York State and moving to Seattle to be near our daughter Lindsey, son-in-law Joel, and new grandchild Eli. I believe real growth and transformation can result from changes we make in our lives, even though change can be uncomfortable or downright scary. However, challenging oneself can be very empowering! I am enjoying the abundant cultural opportunities that Seattle provides as well as furthering my life-long interest in nature in the incredible beauty of the Pacific NW. The therapeutic relationship between patient and therapist is a special one. To help you assess whether or not we make a good connection, I offer a free 30-minute consult.

Born and raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico, I moved to Seattle in 2013 to pursue a higher education in Visual Art. Although painting is still a passion of mine, my interest quickly turned to physical activity and sport during my time at university - the main focus of this being rugby. Three shoulder joint separations, two concussions, and one broken fibula later, I realized that recovery and preventative care (outside of what western medicine typically suggests) is an extremely powerful and important tool - in sport, AND in life. Enter massage therapy. Experimenting helping my own body function as best it could in every facet of life - from getting quality sleep to playing rugby - led me to enroll and graduate from Discovery Point School of Massage, where I learned how important treating the whole human is. I love to mix working with the intricate mechanical structures of the human body and caring for the nervous system of each person - striving to calm, and subdue our \"fight or flight\" instincts.

This is in additional charge for those using insurance as well as time of service pay. Joanna is credentialed with Regence, Premera, Lifewise, Aetna, Kaiser PPO and Medical PIP for those patients who have been in an Auto Accident. Joanna has always moved through the world kinesthetically and loved puzzles. The road to becoming a LMT took the scenic route and is filled with decades in the hospitality industry, severe car accidents, head injuries, falls and recovering from all of them. These experiences fuel Johanna's desire to constantly become a better therapist. Each session aims to meet the body where it is, facilitate a resolution of tension and pain while increasing range of motion. The techniques used are usually non-invasive and effective for a variety of physical ailments including: autoimmune issues, nerve issues, stress and other medical complications. Johanna spends her time cooking, growing food and medicinal plants, sewing, tango dancing, hiking and throwing the perfect dinner gathering. More about Johanna and their 8 month road trip around the country in 2021 can be found at machenamano.com SOMATIC PAIN AND TRAUMA RESPONSE RESOLUTION How is massage related to trauma resolution? And who has trauma? Most people have experienced trauma in their life. Regardless if it was physical, emotional, mental etc, sometimes the brain has difficulty distinguishing between physical danger and mental/emotional stress. The effects of trauma can manifest as pain or inability to move past a state of flight, flight, freeze response, regardless if the experience was physically disabling (car accidents, falls or surgery) or incidents we play off as not being a big deal or ancient history. Repetitive movement (constantly reaching high on a shelf, or stagnant unsupportive posture at a desk for years) is another method which causes a pain and trauma response \"out of nowhere\". Your session will address the disconnect between body, brain and nervous system that can develop from trauma. The result is an increased range and ease of motion, decrease in muscle tension and long term pain resolution. What does that MEAN and what will it feel like? Your session will not feel like a \"regular massage\". But by moving your body out of a state of distress, you will feel better long term. The techniques used by Joanna are: Strain/Counterstrain, Craniosacral, Lymphatic Drainage Technique, Myofascial, Active and Passive release, reciprocal inhibition. If those words are unfamiliar, don't worry, explanations and why each method is used will be explained. Another commonality is increasing communication between your brain, muscle tissue, and nervous system. The experience is not aggressive or invasive and makes no demands which forces the tissue to comply. There can be a lot of sensation, but it is always productive. Oil is rarely used, and little to no swedish massage is utilized. Most sessions can be performed in workout or yoga clothes. While relaxation isn't the main goal, clients feel a deep release of tension, decrease in pain and pure delight at their increased movement at the end of the session.
