This two - day course (14 CEUs) is offered by the VHA Office o f Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation (OPCC&CT) and is designed for providers from all different health backgrounds to help them incorporate nutrition recommendations into Veterans' Personal Health Plans (PHPs). It is informed by the latest research in nutrition and draws from the wisdom of dietitians and functional nutrition practitioners from throughout the VA and beyond. The focus of this course is not to mandate how nutrition guidance is given to Veterans, but rather to offer a learning environment that supports curiosity, exploration, and open discussion of topics that can at times be somewhat complex or controversial. During this course, participants will have an opportunity to explore a number of nutrition -related topics, ranging from h ow foods affect our bodies at a molecular level to how best to support Veterans in making changes related to their eating patterns. Participants will be introduced to a series of Whole Health tools and techniques, as well as an array of nutrition resources to support their clinical work. Areas of focus will include optimizing nutrition for specific disease states, preventing chronic diseases, collaborating effectively with dietitians and other care team members, and sharing nutrition success stories from t hroughout the VA. The research that is presented will be supported by a series of patient vignettes focused on how food and drink can influence pain, mental health, and gastrointestinal function. The latest knowledge on fats, proteins, carbohydrates and v arious micronutrients will be discussed. Mindful awareness, environmental effects on food, and healthy cooking tips will also be addressed. Participants will take time to assess their own nutrition practices and build on their professional skills with mot ivational interviewing and personal health planning with food and drink as a specific focus. They will practice with partners and in small groups. This course can accommodate up to 100 participants, including dietitians, providers, and others who incorpo rate nutrition recommendations into health plans. Participants would ideally represent diverse teams and departments either within one given facility or from multiple facilities. The goal would be that they take what they learn back to their respective t eams.
