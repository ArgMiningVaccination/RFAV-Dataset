It crosses borders, disciplines, time, religions, and ways of knowing and healing to benefit individuals, communities and the environment. From a Holistic perspective, health includes all aspects of a person-mind, body, spirit, community, culture and environment as continuum that can not be reduced to parts. St. Catherine's approach to holistic health also embraces the important role of art, ecology, culture, and social justice among the areas affecting our health and well-being. Courses throughout the program are designed to offer you space to make positive changes in your personal or professional lives to manifest meaning and purpose. Bring your passion for creating healthier and more vibrant communities by learning and integrating holistic practices both personally and professionally. Our academic and experiential MAHS program gives you the tools to integrate holistic health into a variety of professions and fields. Opportunities for skill development, empowerment, and transformation prepare you to play a leading role in the evolution of health and healing. Our graduates apply their research-based knowledge, entrepreneurial spirit, caring, and creativity in a wide variety of capacities. In the United States, holistic health took root during the 1960s and '70s. Concern about our environment was growing, women and cultural minorities were demanding a voice and new opportunities, and ease of travel and communications opened up the world. Today, holistic healing is an important approach to health and healing. Thirty-eight percent of people surveyed recently by the National Institutes of Health's [National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine](http://nccam.nih.gov/) were using complementary and alternative medicine therapies, including deep breathing exercises, meditation, chiropractic care, massage, yoga, or nutrition.
