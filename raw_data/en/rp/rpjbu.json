[Vitiligo](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/vitiligo/) is an unpleasant skin condition where a loss of pigment (melanin) of skin cells, which impart normal color to your skin, occurs resulting in white patches on the affected skin. Even though vitiligo happens to be a harmless skin disorder medically, it affects the social life of the patient adversely. Vitiligo-affected skin area varies from person to person. It can affect various parts of your body, and it can also affect the eyes, hair, and area within the mouth. It is a photosensitive condition such that vitiligo-affected areas are more sensitive to sunlight than the rest of the skin. Occurrence Of Vitiligo: [Vitiligo causes](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/vitiligo/vitiligo-causes.aspx) due to either of the two processes which are mentioned below: 1. Melanin Cell Destruction: This causes the loss of normal skin color resulting in white patches of vitiligo. 2. Defective Melanin Formation Process: Due to the faulty melanin formation process, normal skin color is not formed resulting in patches of vitiligo. You can find vitiligo-affected individuals throughout the world. Vitiligo happens to affect about 2% of the total global population, which includes the population comprising white skin individuals. Around 8% of the total Indian & Mexican population tends to suffer from this skin disorder. As per the survey carried out by the American Academy of Dermatology, about 1% to 2% of Americans in the USA tend to suffer from vitiligo. Both males & females happen to get affected by vitiligo equally. This skin condition can develop at any age. Children of all age groups are affected by it. Vitiligo in childhood is common. We, at Life Force, have vitiligo patients of most nationalities (from more than 180 countries) possessing different skins under our care. So, we got a unique opportunity to understand this skin condition in a much better manner than what other ordinary clinics can. What Causes Vitiligo? Even though the exact vitiligo cause is not yet known, there are various causes known to be responsible for the development of this skin disorder. Several external and internal factors may predispose, worsen, or trigger, or maintain the unpleasant process which causes the onset of vitiligo. Most cases of this disease have a mix of various causes. Find some of the commonly known causes of vitiligo: - Autoimmune Cause: When the melanocytes in your skin happen to get destroyed mistakenly by the immune system, vitiligo occurs. As per the medical observations, particular genes present in the body may make the individual more likely to suffer from vitiligo. An overactive immune system too may be a vitiligo cause. As per a medical study, neuropeptide (i.e. NYP) may be responsible for the damage of melanin. The release of neuropeptide may occur as a response to emotional stress or skin injury, thus it happens due to a combination of causative factors. - Hormonal Changes: A hormonal disorder may cause vitiligo. Disorder of certain hormones, such as melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) or thyroid hormone, can be one of the vitiligo causes. Hormonal changes occurring in the body, for instance, during the teenage, might be responsible for the progression of vitiligo. The occurrence of vitiligo and any other hormonal disorder simultaneously can occur due to an underlying genetic aspect. - Genetic/Hereditary Factor: Vitiligo may run in families. 20% to 30% of familial incidences of vitiligo are noted among the family members of the affected individuals. If one or both the parents happen to suffer from vitiligo, the chances are that their child may develop the same. But, it's not a rule. In several cases of vitiligo, the family history of this disease is not present. We came across a crucial observation by studying several patients that most vitiligo-affected individuals have one of their family members suffering from either one or more of the below-mentioned autoimmune ailments. a. Vitiligo b. Hypothyroid or an underactive thyroid c. Diabetes d. Alopecia Areata (patchy hair loss) e. Cancer f. Other auto-immune diseases (such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, lichen planus, etc.) Vitiligo after injury - Neural theory - Autocytotoxic theory: According to this theory, melanocytes get self-destructed and so does the melanin. This might happen due to neural, genetic, stress, or immunological factors. - Stress - Exposure To Certain Chemicals: Symptoms Of Vitiligo: One of the most common [symptoms of vitiligo](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/vitiligo/vitiligo-symptoms.aspx) is the development of one or more milky white depigmented spots. You may find a single white spot or plenty of them present on your skin. Also, the shape of the white spot varies from round or circular to irregular. You may find an occurrence of generalized de-pigmentation over the entire body, in very few cases of this skin disease. Usually, vitiligo begins with a single spot and it expands in number as well as size. The affected individual may develop single to plenty of spots on his back, limbs, or abdomen that later spread to various other body parts. In some cases of vitiligo, the hair of the patient may turn grey indicating the loss of melanin at the hair roots. Certain vitiligo cases, where the body areas such as finger-tips, area around the eyes, corners of the mouth, and genitals are affected by this ailment, tend to come under the mucocutaneous junction category. Just like the spread of vitiligo is generally slow and progressive, its healing timespan too is quite long. Also, the symmetrical occurrence of the spots on the body's both sides (for instance, hands, legs, etc) is common. In very few and rare cases, vitiligo happens to affect and spread over the entire body of the person. Even though it's a common concern of most patients whether this disorder would spread to all their body areas, it happens quite rarely. How Vitiligo Spreads? Here are some factors which are responsible for the spread of vitiligo to various body areas of the affected individual. 1. Genetic activity 2. Continued Stress factors 3. Hormonal factors 4. Exposure to chemicals Actually, it is not possible to anticipate the pace at which the vitiligo would spread. In several patients with vitiligo, this skin ailment begins with a single white spot and the person might not even develop more spots for plenty of years or throughout his life. On the contrary, in some patients, vitiligo may spread quite rapidly, i.e. from one white spot to hundreds of spots, in just a few months. In some cases, vitiligo may spread intermittently. With rich experience, it is observed that individuals whose certain body areas, such as finger-tips, are affected by this unpleasant skin disease are at greater risk of experiencing an aggressive spread. However, it's not a rule. Some patients may develop grey hair, which indicates a loss of pigment in the hair root.
