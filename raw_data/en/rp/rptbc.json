I am proud to assist Dignity Health as they vaccinate Arizonans, and I encourage all Arizonans to get vaccinated so we can protect ourselves and our loved ones from this deadly virus that has caused too much damage to Arizona lives and livelihoods,\" said Sinema. Dignity Health's Arizona Division is part of Maricopa County Department of Public Health's COVID-19 vaccination roll out. Dignity Health's Southeast Valley vaccination site, where Sinema volunteered today, is leading the state in the total number of vaccinations. It has vaccinated approximately 55% of all health care workers in Maricopa County and is able to administer approximately 4,000 vaccines per day. The Southeast Valley vaccination site has been such a success that it is now the gold standard model for other vaccinations sites across Arizona. This week, Maricopa County began Phase 1B of the rollout, vaccinating K-12 school staff and childcare workers, law enforcement personnel, and Arizonans age 75 and older. Sinema [recently received](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzNKTC65WMo&feature=youtu.be) the COVID-19 vaccine to protect those around her. As an elected leader, Sinema also believes she has a duty to lead by example and demonstrate to the public that the vaccine is safe and effective to better encourage all Americans to get vaccinated.
