You educate a woman; you educate a generation.\" When a woman reaches the limits of modern medical expertise and experiences some of the harsh side effects of modern medical practise, it is certainly understandable that they seek out alternative health methods such as homoeopathy. Eliza Flagg Young, MD, a 19th century physician, once said, \"every woman is born a doctor, men have to study to become one.\" A woman is the primary health care provider in most of the families and is responsible for watching over the health needs of the children, and by their shopping and cooking, they are responsible for fulfilling the nutritional needs of the family. Talking about American women and their interest in homoeopathy during nineteenth century, there were feminists who considered both women's rights and homoeopathic medicine to be important ways to create a healthier society. Even many wives of conventional physicians in the 19th century sought the care of homoeopaths. At an 1883 meeting of the American Medical Association, a physician complained, \"too many wives of conventional physicians are going to homoeopathic physicians. And to make matters worse, they are taking their children to homoeopaths too!\" Michael Carlston, MD, a homoeopath and Assistant Clinical Professor at the University of California at San Francisco School of Medicine, asserted that homoeopathic medicines can be very helpful at the early and middle stages of endometriosis, though because of severe scarring during advanced stages of the disease, they are not very effective later on. Life for a woman today is definitely challenging! The demands are many - a mother, a sister, a daughter and a lover. Finding the time and energy to fulfill all Note: The Homoeopathic Heritage is now a peer reviewed journal since January 2013.

Call for papers for the upcoming issues:EDITORIAL these roles and cope with one's own needs can be difficult which may eventually take its toll on a women's health. Homoeopathy offers endless possibilities for women's health and that's one of the reasons I just love it and sharing my knowledge with others. Homoeopathy is beneficial for the full range of emotional, mental and physical problems that a woman is likely to experience throughout her life. A female hormonal system, when become out of balance, the symptoms can cause great distress both emotionally and physically. A homoeopathic physician completely understands that menstruation in females does not induce uncontrollable emotions, but simply lowers a woman's ability to repress genuine, often difficult emotions, which are already present. Homoeopathy helps to regulate the dramatic fluctuations and associated premenstrual symptoms, as well as heavy or absent periods, or difficulties in conceiving. A Quick Word on Issue Content: This issue of \"The Homoeopathic Heritage\" is an attempt to describe the scope of homoeopathy in genital diseases through different case studies and research papers.

Case study A woman aged 45years came diagnosed with acute depressive disorder (ADD) for the last 5 years. Chief complaints Her main complaint was excessive weeping with a feeling of sadness. She also suffered from bouts of anxiety in different parts of her body, suddenly accompanied with coldness of her body with increased perspiration. She used to feel that no one loved her, as her husband abandoned her forever, and left her all alone. She had a feeling of being discarded from his life like garbage. Many a times, in depression, she had suicidal thoughts. She used to sit still always looking in one direction for hours together. She became very indifferent to her surroundings, and didn't find pleasure in anything. She has learned not to express her anger towards her husband, because it was of no use. She used to keep everything inside. Treatment history She was on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as escitalopram oxalate (Lexapro) and tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline, since the beginning of her illness without any substantial relief. Gynaecological history She used to suffer from constipation during menses; she also had white leucorrhoea with no modalities. Physical generals She loved chocolate and coffee She was also suffering from piles, hence her stools were hard to expel. Her sleep was very disturbing because of frightful dreams; and she usually used to wake up after midnight. Life space investigations She was a mother of a sixteen-year- old girl; her husband (aged 55 years) left her six years back for a young girl aged 22 years and was staying in a live-in relationship. He did not take divorce from the patient yet stating the reason that he used to love her as well, but ever since this incidence, she has started falling sick. The husband came to meet her daily and looked after her daily domestic needs and financially as well, but all she wanted from him was true love and companionship, which he ref used to give.

July 2021 | The Homoeopathic Heritage | 11Lifestyle diseases and homoeopathy By Dr Mahakas Mandal, Dr Samit Dey Introduction The lifestyle of a particular person or group of people is the living conditions, beh aviour, and habits that are typical of them or are chosen by them. Basically, a particular lifestyle of person is a cumulative product of his/her physical capacity co-ordinated with psychological functioning, displayed in the form of habits, behaviour, dietary and living pattern based on his own training sought from childhood, and mimicries he gained from his immediate companions including parents, siblings, peers, etc1,2,3. In the era of evidence based medicine, the dictum of cause behind the cause is also included in the classification of diseases. From the life in womb to the late phase, a man becomes the victim of improperly managed lifestyle. In this growing world each and everyone is in a hurry to ride the train of urbanisation, modernisation, and social changes. The non communicable diseases accounts for 62% of total burden of DALYs and 53% of total deaths4,5. The physical quality life index (PQLI) reflects the well-being of a person, that measure the basic literacy rate, infant mortality rate, and life expectancy but not the disease burden of the person. Lifestyle diseases are ailments that are primarily based on the day to day habits of people. Previously, the major non communicable diseases, i.e. coronary heart diseases, hypertension, COPD, obesity, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia, and cancer were only regarded as life style disorders6. Recent decades have revealed a transform and massive increase in the incidence of lifestyle d isorders. Causes of lifestyle disorders can be divided into three broad categories: A. Modifiable behavioural risk factors, B. Non-modifiable risk factors, and C. Metabolic risk factors. A. MODIFIABLE BEHAVIOURAL RISK FACTORS: Behavioural risk factors such as excessive use of alcohol, bad food habits, eating and smoking tobacco, physical inactivity, wrong body posture and disturbed biological clock increase the likelihood of lifestyle disorders. The modern occupational setting (desk jobs) and the stress related to work is also being seen as a potent risk factor for lifestyle disorders . As per International Classification of Diseases, (ICD 10) problems related to lifestyle (Z72) includes tobacco use, lack of physical exercise, in appropriate diet and eating habits, high risk sexual behaviour, gambling and betting, anti-social behaviour, sleep deprivation, etc7. Keywords: Lifestyle. Homoeopathy. Metabolic risk factors. Non communicable diseases. ABBREVIATIONS: Disability adjusted life years(DALYs). Physical quality life index (PQLI). Diabetes mellitus(DM). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Polycystic lupus erythematosus (SLE).SUBJECTIVE Abstract: Lifestyle diseases refers to diseases associated with modifiable risks from adjustment management, behavioural changes, inactivity to non-modifiable factors like age, gender, genetic and environmental influences. Lifestyle diseases are emerging concept in medicine and about 62% of total population affected by its fatal effect. Children, adult, elderly person all are vulnerable to the risk factors related to lifestyle leading to non communicable disease burden that has impact on DALYs and physical quality life index. The incidence of these diseases is rapidly increasing due to rapid unplanned urbanisation, globalisation and unhealthy lifestyle of the population. Homoeopathy can be a unique mode of treatment in the management of lifestyle diseases as it involves perceiving of each individual case of disease with a thorough consideration of obvious causes, accessory circumstances, constitution, temperament, and underlying miasm. 12 | The Homoeopathic Heritage July 2021SUBJECTIVE As per Z73 of ICD 10, there are disease conditions where persons are affected by the difficulty in life management such burn out (state of vital exhaustion), behaviour pattern changes, lack of relaxation, stress, inadequate social skills, social role conflict, limitation of activities leading to disability, dual sensory impairments, etc7. Eating d isorders in children and teen can develop anorexia, bulimia, binge eating, etc. most of the causes are witnessed among children of low self esteem and deprivation of parental care. If these conditions are not corrected in time it develops anxiety disorders, depression, and substance abuse in young adult life. Study reveals, incidence of PCOS is on a rise among 18 to 25 years girls due to faulty lifestyle. Sometimes teenagers and young adults develop life management problems without any definitive causes resulting in neuropsychoendocrinal disease such as migraine, inflammatory bowel disease, ankylosing spondylitis, irritable bowel diseases, allergic rhinitis, rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, scleroderma, etc. These disease condition leads to low productivity, financial burden and the patient becomes more depressed resulting in cluster of psychological, behavioural and cognitive phenomena, and sometimes indulges in various antisocial activities, addictions or substance abuse thus adding fuel to the fire. Now-a-days the selfie wrist and cervical spondylitis, hardness of hearing from over using earphone, low back pain, high refractive errors all are the gifts of lifestyle that one can't ignore. Bargain counter medication and iatrogenic disease Nowadays, it has become a routine of taking over the counter medication, such as medicines for headache, gastrointestinal upset, constipation, sleeplessness, etc. Their injudicious use increases the burden of diseases among the people. It is witnessed that some medicine taken during the pregnancy directly relates to the increased risk of childhood asthma, childhood epilepsy, childhood obesity, major congenital malformations, musculoskeletal system malformation, VSD, ASD, etc. and thus making the foetus or new born child a victim of lifestyle disorder8. B. NON-MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS: Risk factors that cannot be controlled or modified by the application of an intervention can be called non-modifiable risk factors and include: Age Race Gender Genetics C. METABOLIC RISK FACTORS: Metabolic risk factors lead to four major changes in the metabolic sys - tem that increase the possibility of lifestyle disorders: i. Increased blood pressure (hypertension): chronic elevation of blood pressure above the normal range. Hypertension is the major contributor to cardiovascular diseases and complications. 13% of total global death is due to raised blood pressure. Blood pressure of 130/90 mm of Hg as per American college of cardiology and American heart association defined as hypertension. Major risk factors: diabetes, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, obesity, too much alcohol, tobacco uses, family and genetic predisposition ii. Obesity - It is a man-made disorder of modern era and responsible for majority of health hazards. Body mass index of more than 30 is regarded as obesity. Increased mortality from obesity is primarily due to cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, gallbladder diseases, diabetes mellitus, polycystic ovary syndrome, several types of cancer such as cancer of oesophagus, colon, gallbladder, bile duct, rectum pancreas, prostate, breast, endometrium, cervix, ovaries, etc. obesity also associated with sleep apnoea, steatohepatitis, gastro-esophageal reflux diseases, osteoarthritis, gout, low bac k pain, skin infections, depression, hypogonadism etc. Major risk factors: Obesity can result from increased calorie intake, decreased energy expenditure or a combination of two. Excess accumulation of body fat is also associated with environmental, genetic, social factors and economic condition. iii. Increased blood glucose levels or hyperglycaemia- Diabetes mellitus comprises of a group of metabolic disorders that shows the common features of hyperglycaemia. Major risk factors: overweight, obesity, physical inactivity, saturated fat consumption, stress, PCOS, alcohol, tobacco uses, family history of DM and risk factors for cardiovascular diseases comprises the risk factors for DM. iv. Increased levels of fat in the blood or hyperlipidaemia resulting in coronary heart diseases. July 2021 | The Homoeopathic Heritage | 13 Coronary heart diseases or ischaemic heart diseases is the impairment of the heart function due to inadequate flow to the heart as compared to its need, caused by the obstructive changes in coronary circulation. It expresses itself as angina with exertion or emotional upset, exertional dyspnoea. It may complicate as myocardial infarction, irregularities of heart, cardiac failure, sudden death. Major risk factors: cigarette smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes mellitus, obesity and family his tory of coronary artery diseases before age of 55. Homoeopathic management of lifestyle disorders: In this era, \"a healthy person is one who has not yet been thoroughly examined\". All persons around us are affected by some or other sort of silent killer but not everyone is not suffering from the same fate. If we consider the basic nature of psora, the patients are very anxious about their little ailments and takes medicines for everything. From the early 30s the man, his lifestyle and the internal miasm of the person paves the way to the giant non communicable diseases. The psoric will be the victim of artificial chronic disease. The syco-syphilitic persons will indulge the debauchery, night watching, faulty sexual behaviour, etc. and that will lead to the complications of the diseases. Susceptibility of an individual, mental, physical, social environment (accessory circumstances), constitution, temperament, diathesis and the predominant miasm play a major role in the production of disease. Thus, a comprehensive approach is essential that involves all sectors including health, finance, education, planning and others, to minimise the impact of lifestyle diseases (inappropriately named chronic diseases) on individuals and society. Weight reduction, regular exercise and yoga, behavioural changes, stress reduction, smoking cessation, cholesterol lowering, nutritious balanced diet, stopping the injudicious use of drugs and other substances are the commonly recommended lifestyle modification along with required treatment. The treatment of lifestyle disorder starts with a meticulous case taking or perceiving the case of disease. A proper investigation of the risk factors, obvious causes, accessory circumstances, constitution, temperament, and underlying miasm is essential for the management of these cases. Medicines should be prescribed only after the removal of the causa occasionalis (where it exists) and as per the totality of each individual case of disease. All these conditions if managed properly not only stop the progress of disease but also cure it10. Medicines having their own developmental phase and related to the different phases of life and their sufferings. From J.T.

The disorder can be morphological (polycysticovaries) or predominantly biochemical (hyperandrogeneamia). Hyperan- drogenism, PCOS, can cause inhibition of follicular development, micro cysts in the ovaries, anovulation, and menstrual changes(2 )It is now recognised as a common, heterogeneous, in heritable disorder affecting women throughout their lifetime(1). They may be at increased risk of multiple morbidities, including obesity, insulin resistance, type II diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease (CVD), infertility, and psychological disorders(3). Previous studies in Euro-American populations have shown that women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) have increased levels of \"psychological burden\"(4).The diagnosis of PCOS is based on Rotterdam criteria. As a part of homoeopathic management, this study is given importance to concomitant covering the constitution remedies. This study is given more importance to concomitant symptoms as proposed by Boenninghausen. Concomitant symptoms are based on the inherent constitutional differences and tend to remain constant with a patient, irrespective of the nature of the disease. (5) Among that, concomitant symptoms of MENSTRUATION are given more importance such as Before menstruation At the beginning of menstruation. During menstruation. After menstruation.(6) This study is to define the importance of concomitant symptoms during menstruation and their role in psychosomatisation , personality adaptation, and covering the constitutional remedies. OBJECTIVES The main aim of the study was to understand the importance of concomitants during menstruation, psychosomatisation and personality adaptation MATERIALS AND METHODS Ten cases of PCOS have been treated with homoeopathic medicines had taken up for the study. Cases are Abstract: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common heterogeneous endocrine disorder characterized by irregular menses, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries. Lifestyle modification is a first-line intervention. Existing information indicates a positive role of homoeopathy but more rigorous studies are desirable. This prospective study shows that importance of homoeopathic medicine in PCOS using the concomitant symptoms during menses. Boenninghausen was the first to realise the importance of the concomitants in prescribing and constructed his repertory. Concomitant symptoms are based on the inherent constitutional differences and tend to remain constant with a patient, irrespective of the nature of the disease. A sample of ten cases of PCOS has been treated with concomitant symptoms covering constitutional homoeopathic medicine for a year with regular follow up. Cases are collected from the OPD of Sarada Krishna Homoeopathic Medical College, Kulasekharam. This study is further focused on psychological burden of individuals and how they evolved as psychosomatisation and personality adaptation in the development of PCOS. The data is collected by the art of case taking. RESEARCH PAPER 16 | The Homoeopathic Heritage July 2021RESEARCH PAPER collected from the OPD from our Sarada Krishna Homoeopathic Medical College. Female of 11-40 years of age are included in this study. The remedies have been prescribed on the basis of symptom similarity and on the basis of concomitant and constitutional totality. Collection of standardised case record data of 10 cured cases in which acute, chronic, and intercurrent remedies has been used for the treatment of PCOS. The case has been studied on the basis of case concept form. The problem of the patient has been defined by interview technique and the data's have been recorded in clinical record. The collected data's have been organised, processed and connected each other through: Symptomatic classification and evaluation Clinico-pathological Psychological Hahnemannian miasmatic pathology - current interpretation After tha t the data's have been anal - ysed and synthesised through chronic totalities and in - tercurrent totalities. Totalities have been obtained through reportorial and non - repertorial techniques. All these obtained concepts are pre - sented totally as problem structur - alisation; here several concepts will come into play. The structuralised concepts help to resolve the prob - lem of a patient through remedial as well as non - remedial such as general- individual, general- envi - ronmental, mechanical measures and ancillary measures. These total definition of the case helps to treat the patient through specific ho - moeopathic planning and program - ming. Concept of posology, remedy response, a nd subsequent actions are taken into consideration. The improvement is assessed through the concepts of palliation, cure, sup - pression and the prognosis of the case has been obtained. RESULTS In this study age group between 11 to 40 years of female are considered among that, study showed 11 to 30 years of age women had PCOS. Most of them are students, working women and house wives. Among this, study showed the clinical features such as amenorrhoea, hirsutism, acanthosis nigricans, back pain, leucorrhoea, menorrhagia, itching and burning in genital, lump in breast, irregular menses. All of them had mental emotional state as well as disposition. Most of the females had particular, mental, as well as both mental and physical as concomitants respectively. Most of the cases developed psychosomatisation gradually from childhood. Study reveals that, more intraperson conflict and interpersonal conflicts contributes to the development of PCOS. Constitutional remedies such was useful to treat PCOS constitutionally and most of the case had given counselling to maintain proper healing. Discussion In this study, all the ten cases are selected randomly from the OPD of Sarada Krishna Homoeopathic Medical College, Kulasekharam. The females of age group between 11-40 years were selected. The high prevalence of PCOS is commonly seen in young females who follow modern lifestyle. In PCOS, stress plays the major role and effects of stress producing the psychosomatisation, considering this the topic was selected and also to find out the importance of concomitant during menstruation. Usually age of 15 to 32 years female started to play various phases in their life like responsible daughter, friend, and wife. The peak age of reproductive life too begins here. When they have emotional and behaviour disturbance, their hormones show mild to maximum variation, as it is one of the triggering or main causes of PCOS. In the western life style, students undergoing many phases as mentioned in age, mechanical aided games, school, college, and disappointment are some of the reason for increasing the stress. Some of house wives had PCOS, because they were not engaged on any other works other than household work. Housewives are mostly alone in home at daytime.so they think about the previous bitter events. But according to modern lifestyle it has been changed. In this study, Rotterdam criteria: include oligo-ovulation and/or anovulation, Excess androgen activity, polycystic ovaries (by gynaecologic ultrasound)(7)which noted the disorder as having 1. This study suggests that most of the patient presented with irregular menses with minimal functional level symptomatology and pathology. In homoeopathic disease evolution that Dr M.L. Dhawale has discussed, psora, the sympathetic, became overactive due that ovarian imbalance leads to functional menstrual disorder. Acrid non- July 2021 | The Homoeopathic Heritage | 17infective leucorrhoea with emotional background is a psoric expression. When reduce sympathetic activity and over stimulation with resultant slowing down of activity, processes, faculties and functions, accelerated by increasing activity of the para sympathetic. The system goes into a state of exhaustion. The psoric patient slips into sycosis(8). From this study, emotional symptom become more prominent, emotion plays major role for the development of psychosomatisation from suppressed and repressed emotion. Mental symptoms are classified into mental emotion, intelligent and behaviour emotion, and intelligent. Dr M.L. Dhawale explained about classification of mental symptoms, emotion plays a significant part in the livers of most of the individuals, hence the mental state open with this section. The primary emotions of anger-sadness, love-hate and fear- anxiety are given prominence. The secondary emotion like suspicious, jealousy, etc. gets attached to those dominant emotions where they arise as an offshoot. Intellectual state comprises of the complex of primary faculties (consciousness, thinking, memory), the derivations (perception and decision making) and the resultants of the emotional and the intellectual functioning (judgement, confidence, person, etc.), action (speech and behaviour) and functioning (autonomic functions, sleep and systems functioning). There is also a final conclusion as to the nature of the total result in terms of the balance achieved(9). Dr M. L. Dhawale has also mentioned about time -dimension concept and expression among that included time-change, periodicity, evolution, causation, concomitance, velocity, direction, and eternity. RESEARCH PAPER Any phenomenon in nature evolves in a field and expresses itself in various co-ordinate systems (C-S). It is possible for an external observer to single out any one of the many C-S as the main one and analyse it from the sequential point of view (causation). The other C-S evolve concomitantly with the main C-S but we are unable to detect a sequential relationship between these. These therefore fall outside our concept of causality. All the same, these can be utilised by the external observer of the phenomenon as essential identifying (as well as differential) characteristics of the phenomenon in question. Concomitant co- ordinate series thus give us another equally important dimension of the expression of time(10). The concomitant bear no other relationship to the chief complaint than this time association. The study suggests that concomitant symptom present in three forms mental, physical and particular. Psychosomatisation happens where the person emotion becomes imbalance and their inner core fails to express. Thus, the body express it in the form of psychosomatisation. From this reveals PCOS is the psychosomatic disorder rather than mentioning it as disease. This was explained by Dr Dhawale, in \"Evolution and Expression of mental symptoms\" he mentioned that, the mental symptoms which forms the most important core of homoeopathic prescribing always are an expression of the continued conflict: the conflict that is between higher and lower animal instincts; between the higher values and the blind consummation of our desires; between the spirit that guides the substance towards higher values, images and ideas and infantile egoism and egotism that erode as well as corrode all values, finally dragging the organism downward to self-destruction. The transcendence of the soul is thus prevented by the substance, and the conflict produced leads to anguish which is expressed peripherally as mental symptoms(11). For the peaceful life, person knows to follow the balance inter and intra personal relation, when in the inner core arises the conflict, the person has to suffer from the personality adaptation. It was expressed as physical or body level in physical it expressed as craving and aversion, sexual sphere and in body level it was expressed as symptoms. PCOS is one of the psychosomatic disorders with relation to inter and intra personal relation. This was explained by Dr Dhawale, in evolution and expression of mental symptoms, He says that a patient needs to examine the patient's interpersonal relationships from childhood onwards with reference to his wishes, ambitions and vocations. He can then know the affections, hatreds, resentments, vexation, humiliation, indignation, fear, conscience, disillusion, etc. which the patient experienced. His emotional nature must be understood from the stand of point of externalism, not only for the diagnosis of the simillimum, but also for the re-education which is to similimum. This remedial action helps to restore the internal governance and balance of the system and aids it in realising the \"higher purpose of existence\" (Hahnemann) under the superior guidance of the physician who regards his life as a mission to restore the sick to health(11). In modern life style, stress plays a major role, for that counselling was needed and it plays important management along with medicine. 18 | The Homoeopathic Heritage July 2021RESEARCH PAPER Conclusion As per study, homoeopathic treatment is effective in treating PCOS cases. The totality covering concomitant and constitutional remedy are more effective in treating PCOS. Incidence of PCOS was highly prevalent among the students, working women's and house wife under the age group 15-25 years. This is the age, were females have more chances for psychosomatisation from their suppressed and repressed emotion due to the value system they hold. From their value system, they have to maintain healthy and balanced environment, when there is any imbalance occurred between intra- and inter-personal relation leads to personality adaptation.

Introduction Pain, in itself, speaks a language which if it cannot be shared, becomes more insurmountable from the rest. Menstrual pain or dysmenorrhoea is most prevalent yet most neglected disorder faced by a woman thinking it to be a normal physiological process, for at least once while attaining their womanhood . It is chronic, cyclical, lower abdominal or pelvic pain which may radiate to the back or to the thighs, occurring during menstruation.1 of sufficient magnitude making incapacitate the patient in day-to-day activities2 where they may experience associated physical and emotional symptoms,3 interrupting their educational and social life4. The true incidence and prevalence are not clearly established in India.1,3 due to cultural reasons menstrual problems often get unreported5 but some studies has mentioned it in range of 50% to 87.8%.3 and found to be the leading cause of school/work absenteeism.6 It is been broadly categorised into two types: primary due to absence of any underlying uterine condition and secondary where pelvic pathology is present.2 Aetiology can be summarised in psychosomatic factors, abnormal anatomical and functional aspect of myometrium like irregular thickening, dysperistalsis, etc, imbalance in the autonomic nervous control of uterine muscle, role of prostaglandins especially PGF2, vasopressin, endothelins, leukotrienes and platelet activating factors. The pain mostly starts with or few hours before the onset of menses. The severity of pain usually lasts for few hours, may extend to 24 hours but seldom persists beyond 48 hours.2 Further investigations a re rarely warranted if th e history and examination findings are suggestive of primary dysmenorrhoea.7 Women usually seek medical advice when self-help measures such as heat and over the counter drugs fail to relieve. The mainstays of conventional therapies are NSAIDs, contraceptive pills8 and in cases where formers don't help invasive and surgical intervention is opted. But several times, these conventional therapies are not better tolerated by some females9 and have also been seen to have adverse effects associated with it.10 So many women prefer to seek complementary and alternative therapies to cope with Abstract: Introduction: Primary dysmenorrhoea is a type of cyclical chronic pelvic pain among adolescent and young women which is be due to excessive prostaglandin, leukotriene, and vasopressin production, as well as myometrial ischaemia or due to uterine malformation. Material and methods: a prospective, observational, open-labelled study having 30 diagnosed cases of primary dysmenorrhoea, selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, case taking was done on the basis of the principles of homoeopathy, prescription was based on totality of symptoms, repertorial totality and analysis and finally referring to materia medica. Follow up was evaluated by changes in clinical presentation, changes in score of WaLIDD monthly and lastly statistical analysis of data was done using MS-excel. Results: This study result shows significant reduction in the disease intensity scores after the homoeopathic treatment. Conclusion: This study result suggests a positive role of homoeopathic treatment as an alternative medicine in cases of primary dysmenorrhoea.CLINICAL 20 | The Homoeopathic Heritage July 2021the conditions.11 Homoeopathy is seen to be an effective and safe alternative to synthetic hormones without placing the patient at risk.12 Disease severity and quality of life demonstrated marked and sustained improvements following homoeopathic treatment period.13 The best part of the homoeopathic medicine is that it not only relieves pain, but also cures the tendency to have menstrual cramps. This means that after some time of treatment, the problem is completely cured and one is able to get rid of the problem permanently.14 The treatment should be continued until the patient menstruates normally or nearly so. Prescriptions made during the inter- menstrual period are seen to be most efficacious, as latent expression is shown more clearly and the acute expression has quieted down, so it is better to base prescription upon this symptomatology.15 Methodology Sources of data - OPD and IPD of Govt. Homoeopathic Medical Col - lege & Hospital, Bhopal, Number of cases - 30 cases excluding dropouts Definitions used for study purpose - Selection of medicine - was based on individualisation after proper analysis, evaluation and miasmatic analysis of the case as per homoeopathic principles. Follow up- cases were followed up properly on one month interval and results was assessed on the basis of clinical symptoms and changes in WaLIDD scores Methods of tests/procedures- Detailed and thorough case taking of each and every case having primary dysmenorrhoea. a. Relevant clinical examina- tions and lab oratory investigations, if required. b. Evaluation of symptoms as per homoeopathic principles and framing the totality. c. Analysis, evaluation and repertorisation of the totality of symptoms taking help of Computer-aided (digital) RADAR repertory. d. Final selection of medicine by miasmatic inference and consulting homoeopathic materia medica. e. On the basis of susceptibility, potency, dose and repetition was decided following strict homoeopathic principles. f. General management includes proper diet and regimen, hygiene and rest. g. Timely review of homoeopathic prescription on the basis of patient's response. Statistical methods Assessments of cases were done with the help of WaLIDD Score and changes in values at the baseline visit and last follow up visit. Final calculation was done to find out the p-value with the help of paired t- test for two variables in Microsoft Office Excel 2007. Observation and result: In total no. of cases (n=30) the critical ratio, paired-t follows a distribution on with n-1 degree of freedom. The 0.1% level is 3.659, 1% level is 2.756 and 5% level is 2.045 for 29 degree of freedom. WaLIDD score table which is the summation of the entire variables, on analysing the \"t\" value through microsoft excel, P(T<=t) two-tail value is 2.93 which is greater than the table at 5% (p<0.05) . This study provides evidence to say that, this is significant reduction in the disease intensity scores after the Homoeopathic treatment . Discussion In this study, 35 cases of Primary Dysmenorrhoea of age group 11 to 25 years were enrolled from general screening of patients out of which 5 cases were dropped out rest 30 cases completed the study with regular follow ups( n= 30). Before enrolling in the study population, every patient was evaluated and diagnosed on the basis of clinical history, clinical examination and WaLIDD scoring which is dedicatedly used for diagnosis of primary dysmenorrhoea. Proper case taking is been done with proper evaluation and analysis of case making totality of symptoms to prescribe. The patients are been prescribed indicated medicine and doses as per the totality of symptoms and requirement in every individual case. The analysis of the sample size of the 30 cases depicted highest preponderance of the primary dysmenorrhoea disorder in age group 14 to 16 years. The age incidence depicts the disease start and reporting in clinic or to physician by the patients. Among the sample size population it is been noted that the majority of cases are which are affected had the onset of menstrual period or menarche before or at the age of 13 years comprising the data as suggesting the relation of early menarche. The study expresses that the role of family history is more or less related to the disorder. The miasm is an important aspect to be taken into account while prescribing in homoeopathic system of medicine. The effect of miasm cannot be overlooked while treating any case. CLINICAL July 2021 | The Homoeopathic Heritage | 21In study's sample size, population depicted that the disorder covered more of pseudo-psora miasm and sycotic miasm. Homoeopathy is a science of individualisation in which each and every case is different and it should be dealt differently on basis of symptom similarity and totality of symptoms. The medicine should be based on strict homoeopathic principle then only it would bring out the true miraculous results. In this study all patients were prescribed on the basis of individualisation and totality of symptom following homoeopathic principles. It was seen that the remedy, Pulsatilla nigricans, relieved and brought about positive changes in majority of cases. Other medicines seen emerging in such cases were from Natrum group, Silicea To and evaluate the effect of prescribed medicine, the WaLIDD score itself is been used.16 Analysis of WaLIDD score which is the integrated tool having the entire variable showed marked changes suggesting the positive effect of homoeopathic remedies on Primary dysmenorrhoea disorder. The period of this clinical study was too short to assess the curability for primary dysmenorrhoea. Although there was good improvement in majority of cases, but continuous improvement cannot be assured, and to see the curability of the disease it demands more time. Conclusion The statistical demonstration of the study implicates the effectiveness of homoeopathic treatment in cases of primary dysmenorrhoea as it reduces the severity of complaints with other associated complaints as well.

Age - 2- 10 years Both gender Exclusion Criteria: Child should not have any other co-morbidity like tumors, cerebral palsy, hormonal disorders, chronic infective pathologies like tuberculosis, etc., or any organic disease. Individual who cannot adhere to the follow up schedule Homoeopathic group Selection of medicine: In this group, as mentioned above, after case taking, the case was repertorised using Synthesis Repertory by Dr Frederick Schroyens as per homoeopathic principles, and the physician identified a group of similar medicines, however final selection of medicine was done after referring the homoeopathic materia medica. Selection of dose and potency: Only a single drug was used at a time. Potency was selected according to the nature of the case, i.e. susceptibility. The potency of the same drug was enhanced when no further improvement was noticed and there was no change in prescribing totality. Any change (improvement/deterioration) triggered administration of placebo or change in potency (from 30C to 200C or 1M) or change in remedy following the guidelines in homoeopathy. There was no change in prescribing totality if the patient developed any acute problem like cold, fever, etc. The medicine was administered us - ing the 5 cup method.

Prior ethical clearance was taken from the Ethics Committee of the hospital to undertake the trial. The protocol adhered to Good Clinical Practices of India. Cases were enrolled from 2018 to 2019 and were observed every month for a period of 1 year. Study design: prospective randomised placebo control single blind clinical trial - parallel design. Patients who visit the neurology OPD at Bai Jerbai Wadia Hospital who have been diagnosed as purely autistic (without any co morbidity) by the Neurological team were enrolled for the study. The cases were then screened using the inclusion exclusion criteria. The psychologist diagnosed all the patients based on childhood autism rating scale 2(CARS). 92 patients were taken for this study of which after a few dropouts we had 84 children who were studied in detail. In this study, patients were randomly selected based on the randomisation table to receive placebo or homoeopathic medicines. Half of the study group received homoeopathic medicines along with occupational therapy and the other half received placebo along with O.T. Occupational therapy was on for a minimum period of 6 months before the start of the study to understand any effects it had had on the child. If any allopathic medication were on during the period of study, we waited for 3 months before we enroll the patient for the study and introduce homoeopathic medicines to allow the allopathic medicines to elicit their effect. All the allopathic medicines will be unaltered through the course of the therapy. July 2021 | The Homoeopathic Heritage | 23RESEARCH PAPER cups of equal quantity of water.

Follow up: Follow up was done every month. OBSERVATION AND RESULTS A total of 92 autistic patients were screened and 84 were enrolled after fulfilling the inclusion criteria. These patients were randomised to either receive homoeopathy (n=42) or placebo (n=42). The data of the 84 autistic children were analyzed using the SPSS version 24.0 A Shapiro - Wilk's test (p 0.05) and a visual inspection of their histograms, normal Q - Q plots and box plot showed that the ATEC scores were distributed with the skewness of 0.227 (SE = 0.263) and a kurtosis of -1.363 (SE = 0.520). This inference that the data is non parametric. Hence the non - para - metric statistics was used to analyse the data: 1. Within the study group and placebo group: ATEC score were having repeated measurements hence Friedman test was used as inferential statistics.

Median (IQR) at the beginning of the treatment was 70.95, at the end of 3 months 70.14, at the end of 6 months 69.36, at the end of 9 months 68.12 and at the end of one year 67.31. There was statistically significant reduction observed overall. However, there is no statistically significant difference observed between 3 months to 6 months. Rest within the groups have shown the statistically significant difference. Clinical effect interpretation: The Cohen's delta elicits the no effect. after the occupational therapy. The number needed to treat is 15.16; which means 100 Autistic patients take the homoeopathic treatment along with the occupational therapy for one year, 7% will have the favor - able outcome on ATEC scale.

REMEDIES PRESCRIBED: In th e homoeopathy group, amongst 42 patients, the following remedies were used. 1. Carcinosinum was prescribed in 8 patients of which 3 showed marked improvement, 4 showed, mild improvement and 1 showed no improvement. 2. Tuberculinum bovinum was prescribed in 8 patients in which 6 showed marked improvement and 2 patients showed mild improvement 3. Medorrhinum was prescribed to 7 patients of which 5 showed marked improvement, 1 showed mild improvement and 1 showed no improvement. 4. Natrum muriaticum was prescribed to 7 patients of which 4 patients showed marked improvement, 2 patients showed mild improvement and 1 patient showed and no improvement. 5. Phosphorus was prescribed to 5 patients of which 2 patients showed marked improvement and 3 patients showed mild improvement. 6. Cuprum metallicum was prescribed to 3 patients of which 1 showed exceptional improvement and 2 showed mild improvement 7. Baryta carbonicum was prescribed to 2 patients who showed marked improvement. 8. Pulsatilla nigricans was prescribed to 1`patient who showed mild improvement 9. Sulphur was prescribed to 1 patient who showed marked impr ovement Discussion The entire experience demonstrated a significant reduction in the autistic features of the children. Mean change in ATEC 15.12 and ATEC mean percent change 19.72, p value<0.05) was observed. Homeopathic intervention brought about modification in the behaviour quite rapidly followed by changes in other aspects. Children who were gradually regressing and showing a trend towards deterioration showed marked reversal in the autistic features. There was sharp decrease in the ATEC score after starting homeopathic treatment. When we examine mean scores, there also we can see that almost 34% improvement take place in the first quarter, and 60% by six months. Conclusion Even though the study was a small done, done with a few children over a short period of time, we were able to show that with homoeopathy, we could bring the mean ATEC score from 83.17 to 71.52 within just 12 months (whereas in the placebo group it went from 70.95 to 67.31 in 12 months). The study had quite a few limitations but it serves as a sample for future studies to take place in this field of autism that has a tremendous scope to be treated using homoeopathy. Further a multicenter trial enrolling larger number of participants, from different homoeopathic research centers, shall increase the generalisability of the results. We also hope for a double-blind clinical study with the option of switching remedies through the study with a long term follow up period of at least 5 years to be able to verify the results of this study.

Aarathi Reddy Introduction Presence of functioning endometrium in sites other than uterine mucosa is called endometriosis. Ectopic endometrial tissues are found at sites other than uterus and are called endometriosis externa. Endometriosis is an aggressive, progressive and invasive disease. Prevalence is about 10-15%. Sites of endometriosis: abdominal, extra abdominal, remote. Risk factors 1. Low parity 2. Delayed child bearing 3. Family history of endometriosis 4. Genital tract obstruction 5. Environmental toxins 6. Peritoneal fluid abnormalities.1 Many theories have been proposed to explain the occurrence of endometriosis but genetic predisposition is now evolving and focus has been given on alterations or genetic mutations that may start in-utero or in adolescents and young adults.2 Immune system is postulated by many to have a role in determining who can develop endometriosis, as well as the extent and clinical manifestation of the disease. 3 Adolescents with the disease are more likely to experience a variety of symptoms which can be safely improved or alleviated by appropriate menstrual management or suppression.4However; sometimes cycle pains respond poorly to anti prostaglandins and contraceptive pills and this may be attributed to internal scarring, adhesions, pelvic cysts, chocolate ovarian cysts, bowel obstruction and peritonitis.5 The diagnosis of adolescents' endometriosis is sometimes enigmatic; however, history and clinical examination usually lead the physician to suspect it.6 The use of AUS and MRI remain an important addition to the non-invasive diagnosis and should be performed before treatment, especially surgical one.7 On the other hand some biological markers may be used for prediction and treatment follow up in endometriosis, commonly CA125.8 It goes without saying that laparoscopy with biopsy of the suspicious lesions remains the gold standard for diagnosis as well as management intervention in severe cases. 9Adolescent endometriosis is an underestimated health problem particularly in developing countries. Many reasons contribute to this undeniable difficulty in diagnosis. Of these; difficult visiting of gynaecologists by young girls, the infeasibility of local examinations, trans-vaginal ultrasound and diagnostic surgical procedures. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of adolescence endometriosis among school girls with severe dysmenorrhea.6 Clinical features 1. dysmenorrhoea 2. abnormal uterine bleeding 3. Infertility 4. Dyspareunia 5. Chronic pelvic pain 6.

Sepia officinalis is having more efficacy in treating the infertility with endometriosis. The remedy was chosen according to the principles and practices of homoeopathy and given on the basis of constitutional totality after detailed case taking, recording, interpretation, and evaluation of symptoms, and repertorisation, whenever required. Hence, Sepia officinalis was chosen as the prescribing remedy. First prescription: Sepia officinalis 200+ was prescribed, three doses was advised, for 3 consecutive mornings, and placebo 15 days.CASE STUDYARTICLE 30 | The Homoeopathic Heritage July 2021Figure 4 Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 5CASE STUDYARTICLE July 2021 | The Homoeopathic Heritage | 31Conclusion Thus, it is the responsibility of the homoeopathic fraternity to make people aware about the scope of homoeopathy for infertility. The dynamic homoeopathic remedies are not only effective but can do wonders in treating infertility with the most efficient and gentle form. References 1.

They may be pedunculated or sessile(1,2), single or multiple. They may vary in size from as small as a sesame seed to as big as a golf ball (0.5 - 4 cm). It is probable that they are present in 25% of women with abnormal vaginal bleeding although atleast 10% of asymptomatic women are also likely to have polyps.(2) In most cases, the uterine polyps are benign but removal is necessary to exclude the remote possibility of infertility & malignancy. Causes The cause is unknown. It may be linked to changes in oestrogen levels. Endometrial polyps are more common in reproductive age group especially in 40s or 50s. It may be due to the changes in oestrogen levels that happen just before and during menopause.(3)It would appear that these endometrial polyps are relatively insensitive to cyclical hormonal changes and so are not shed at the time of menstruation. In addition they may contain hyperplastic foci, particularly in those that are symptomatic.(2) The other risk factors may include: Obesity Hypertension Diabetes Women experiencing abnormal bleeding while taking HRT Tamoxifen - a drug used for breast cancer (found in upto 30% of such cases)(4) Clinical presentation a. Asymptomatic, especially in case of solitary/ small sized polyp b. Unscheduled vaginal bleeding or spotting is the commonest symptom. The persistent intermenstrual bleeding for at least 3 months or more is significant.c. Heavy bleeding d. Vaginal bleeding after menopause e. Trouble getting pregnant Complications of uterine polyps Malignant change is rare but it may coexist with endometrial carcinoma. The predictors of malignancy are: (a) Size more than 10 mm; (b) Postmenopausal status; (c) Abnormal uterine bleeding(4) Polyps also interferes with fertility because they can keep a fertilized egg from attaching to your uterus or block your fallopian tubes or cervix. Miscarriages are more common in females having polyps. Diagnosis(2,3) Ultrasound (USG) Transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) Hysterosonography Hysteroscopy Endometrial biopsy Case report Introduction Miss Pink, period (LMP), aggravation (>), amelioration (>)Abstract: Endometrial polyps or uterine polyps are abnormal growths of endometrial glands which typically protrudes into the uterine cavity. Endometrial polyps are relatively common and usually benign in nature, may affect women of reproductive age groups as well as post-menopausal women. In modern medicine, surgical intervention is the only treatment but as per my little experience, most of the female gynaecological diseases can be cured effectively by a well selected homoeopathic simillimum. The constitutional approach always yields wonderful results.CASE STUDYARTICLE July 2021 | The Homoeopathic Heritage | 33CASE STUDY female came to me on 14th September 2020 with the complaint of irregular vaginal bleeding with weakness and trembling of legs. She was working as a beautician but stopped due to lockdown imposed during Covid-19. She was fair in complexion, with blue circles around the eyes. Presenting complaints The chief complaints of the patient was intermenstrual vaginal spotting since 5-6 days. Along with that, she also complains of much weakness with trembling of legs. History of presenting complaints The patient was apparently well 5-6 days back then she started complaining of intermenstrual spotting when she urinates. She looked very depressed and sad. On further enquiry, it was found that some family disputes were going on for the last 15- 20 days since then she became silent and irritable; anger was quite visible but suppressed, otherwise she was a sincere happy girl but emotional too. Menstrual history: LMP: 29th August 2020 Duration 2-3 days Character of the bleeding: Dark red in colour with few clots Past history: she had acne in the past for which she had undergone homoeopathic treatment (6-7 months back) Family history: Nothing specific was found Physicals generals The patient's appetite was quite decreased, doesn't want to eat anything. She is thirstless. She had desire for salty things. She is a hot patient. Mental generals She was irritable in nature, jealous, contradiction aggravated her. She became angry on slightest triggers but didn't express herself. Suppressed anger, used to weep only when alone, fastidious. On examination The patient was found to be hypotensive, measured blood pressure was 100/60mm Hg. The appearance of tongue was found to be clean and moist. Investigations: Ultrasound revealed that the endometrial lining was mildly thickened and heterogenous in polyp sized 11* 7.8mm.

Mind - irritability 2. Mind - jealousy Selection of remedy with justifica - tion The repertorial result of the case showed that the highest ranked remedy which covers most of the symptoms of the patient was Natrum muriaticum . After considering materia medica , Natrum muriaticum was found to be a useful remedy for menstrual irregularities, depression. The general constitution and mental picture of the patient was also similar to Natrum muriaticum as described in materia medica(7). This remedy was also covering the predominant miasm, i.e. tuberculo- psoric miasm.(5) 3. Mind - weeping, tearful mood: alone, being agg 4. Mind - contradiction: ailments from; agg 5. Stomach - thirstlessness 6. Generalities - food & drinks: salt or salty food desires 7. Clinical - hypotension 8. Extremities - trembling; legs 9. Female genitalia - haemorrhage; uterine, metrorrhagia Repertorial result Thus, according to the totality of the symptoms and miasmatic predominance, SINGLE DOSE of Natrum muriaticum 200CH was prescribed according to the susceptibility of the patient. Prescription Natrum muriaticum 200CH, single dose Followed by Placebo 30, thrice a day for one month. Management Along with the homoeopathic medicines, the patient was advised to exercise regularly for atleast 30 minutes. She was suggested few disease specific yoga exercises to be followed regularly like butterfly pose, cobra pose (bhujangasana), standing forward bend, hare pose, etc. Diet should include variety of healthy foods like whole grains, green leafy vegetables, low fat dairy products, seasonal fruits. Drink atleast 3-4 litres of water in a day. Restrict excessive salt or sweets intake. A diet rich in transfat should be avoided.

Pustular eruptions completely disappeared. Conclusion In modern era, the menstrual problems are increasing more likely due to sedentary life styles, improper diet and mental stress which disturbs the hormonal levels. Homoeopathy have promising results in such gynaeco-surgical cases and saves the patients from getting under the surgical knife. Homoeopathy treats the patient as a whole, not just the disease. Individualisation plays the major role in the selection of most similar remedy. Patients may respond well to the constitutional remedy than to a specific or therapeutic remedy.References 1.

Chotaliya Introduction Homoeopathic materia medica contains many symptoms related to female genital organs which are collected during drug proving, toxicological data and clinical experiences from various pioneers. Homoeopathic medicines give huge contribution to Gynaecology and Obstetrics department of medical science with their dynamic action in management of female disorders. Conium maculatum (from Apiaceae family) is one the medicines known for its action in female disorders. Due to its action in various female disorders its action is one of the curious matters for every physician. Study of Conium maculatum medicine in context to its role in various cases with some data regarding cellular and bio-chemical action explores its multitasker role in management of female disorders. Objective of study: Primary objective of study was, \"to explore the role of Conium macu - latum in various female disorders through various literatures in medi - cal field\", and secondary objective was \"to understand its utility from various data related to its action on cellular and biological level. Materials and methods: A literature search was conducted using various data sources like pubmed, web of science, google search engine, Encyclopedia Ho - moeopathica and other printed sources. Inclusion criteria: 1) All the lit - erature sources from homoeopathy (computerised and printed) were examined to collect information regarding the role of Conium macu - latum in female disorders. 2) While various data regarding action of Conium maculatum on cellular level were collected from various data sources with time period of 10 years (2011-2020). Exclusion criteria: Any research study related to Conium maculatum or its action before 2011 were ex - cluded. OBSERVATIONS AND RESULTS Conium maculatum as poisonous substance: (1) Conium maculatum is an erect an - nual or biennial, virtually glabrous, with a crushed. Conium maculatum , com- monly known as poison hemlock, is one of the most toxic members of the plant kingdom. The concentrations and relative ratio of different Co- nium maculatum alkaloids appear to depend on different factors such as temperature, moisture, time and age of the plant. It contains piperidine alkaloids (coniine and cyanapine). The consumption of varying parts of the plants can cause different de - grees of clinical effects. The leaves are more dangerous in spring, and the fruit (mature fruits) are in fall. Conium at cellular level (active principles):(2) potential, CD-Spectroscopy- circular dichroism spectroscopyAbstract: Background: Women are symbolised for gentleness and sensitivity, hence diseases related to women must treat with gentle methods. Homoeopathy is known for its gentle treatment and providing relief in many female disorders. Homoeopathic medicines prove their efficacy in management of female disorders, and among these medicines, Conium maculatum occupies its unique place in management of various female disorders from dysmenorrhoea to carcinoma related to female genital organ. So, it is imperative to understand the role of this multitasker in depth. Materials and methods: A literature search was conducted using various data sources like pubMed, web of science, google search engine, Encyclopedia Homoeopathica and other printed sources like different materia medica to explore its action regarding female disorders. Result and Conclusion: This study not only explores the role of conium in female disorders but also explores its action at cellular level. SUBJECTIVE July 2021 | The Homoeopathic Heritage | 43contains a principles, coniine and gamma coniceine are considered the teratogenic agents for cattle, pigs and sheep. Conium maculatum as medicine: As a medicine, it is a sedative and antispasmodic. It is directly antagonist to strychnine and therefore used as antidote in strychnine poisoning and also in tetanus and hydrophobia. It may prescribe in undue nervous motor excitability (dentition, early stage of paralysis agitans, spasms of gullet an d larynx) and as inhalation to relieve coughing in bronchitis, whooping cough and asthma. In china, it may be used medicinally to relieve pain and reputedly as a cancer cure. (1) Some articles (short summary) re - lated recent research studies about conium a re worthy to understand.

Conium maculatum as homoeo - pathic medicine: Action and symptoms of conium were mentioned by many homoeopaths in different materia medica but some are very useful data regarding the role of Conium maculatum in homoeopathy. Dr Burt mentioned about atrophic condition at glands related to genital organs. Let's explore the role of Conium maculatum in female disorders except its popular use in vertigo and neurological disorders. Menstrual irregularities: Amenorrhea : Dr Hughes mentioned about role of Conium maculatum in amenorrhoea where it is part of a general depression of sexual activity. (5) Dysmenorrhoea: Guernsey mentioned Conium maculatum for dysmenorrhoea. (6) Dr as second-class remedy for dysmenorrhoea. (7) Dysmenorrhoea, with drawing-down thighs. (8) Meno-metrorrhagia: Dr Boger mentioned about irregular menses under conium. (9) Menses delayed and scanty; parts sensitive. Rash before menses. Itching around pudenda. (8) Inflammatory condition of female genital organs: Ovaritis: In a case of acute ovaritis supervening during chronic inflammation of this organ, and where the face had already become hippocratic and the pulse filliform, Conium maculatum brought about a lancinating pain. (8) Pulsatilla nigricans is often serviceable also in more frequent chronic form of the disease; but it has rival in conium, which is strongly recommended by Dr Drury. (5) Vaginitis: Dr Jahr mentioned about utility of Conium maculatum in chronic vaginitis and also for vagi - nal fistula. (7) Leucorrhoea after mic - turition. (8) Vulvitis: Dr Jahr recommended this medicine if the inflammation had been caused by mechanical influ - ences. (7) Mastitis: suitable for induration af - ter inflammation. Mammae lax and shrunken, hard, painful to touch. Stitches in nipples. Wants to press breast hard with hand. Breasts en - large and become painful before and during menses. (8) Tumour (fibroadenoma, fibroid, polyps and other benign and Conium maculatum and corn- plaster to remove tumours of the breasts and testes, and to repress the secretion of milk.(10) Dr Burnett men - tioned about usefulness of Conium maculatum in case of tumour where cause is mechanical one( traumatic injury, fall or blow) and he also men - tioned about role of Conium macula - tum in relieving neuralgic pain.(11) Dr Nash mentioned about some indica - tion of conium with remedy differ - entiation which are as follow, Many cases of lumps or swellings in the breasts, Conium maculatum and Sili- cea terra both have hardness of -mae, Conium maculatum right, Silicea terra left nodules.(12) \"Acting, as Co - nium does, upon the glandular system, we naturally expect it to be a great anti- scrofulous and anti-cancerous remedy. We use it for swelling and induration of glands after contusions and bruises; tumour of various kinds, especially scir - rhus, coming on after injury, are also helped by this remedy. These indura - tions are quite common in the mammae, in the testicles, and in the uterus\". (13) Prolapse of uterus: Dr Guernsey mentioned in following way, Prin - cipally with Conium, fifteen years ago, I cured permanently a case of prolapsus of six years' standing, in which all pessaries and abdominal supporters, even that of the celebrat - ed Mrs. Betts but failed to keep the uterus within the vulva. The pro - lapsus was complicated with indu - ration, ulceration and profuse leu - corrhoea. This lady has since borne several children, and has never ex - perienced a return of the malady. All cases of prolapsus can be cured by the use of the indicated homoeo - pathic remedy.(14) The prolapsus was complicated with induration, ulcer - ation and profuse leucorrhoea- these indications were mentioned under the heading of cancer.(15) Indura- tion and enlargement of ovaries and womb, prolapsus uteri complicated with induration and ulceration of the cervix, with profuse leucorrhoea, have been repeatedly cured with Co- nium maculatum on the indication of these complaints having been the result of suppressed sexual desire.(13) Pregnancy, labour and parturition: Unready conception. (8) Conium maculatum is useful for symptoms like anorexia, disgust to bread, SUBJECTIVE July 2021 | The Homoeopathic Heritage | 45craving for coffee and salt things, pyrosis /acidity are seen during pregnancy. (14) Conium maculatum is indicated where fetal movement disturbs mother's sleep. (16) conium also mentioned for nosebleed during pregnancy and cough that excite the vomiting. Induration of cervix after delivery where stinging pain is indication for Conium maculatum. (17) Neuralgia: The natural enlargement of the breasts at this period causes undue pain and tension. Conium maculatum and Pulsatilla nigricans are suitable here when neuralgia predominates. (14) According to Cow - perthwaite, swelling, soreness and pain in the breasts preceding the menses, either with or without tu - mor is useful clinical indication for Conium maculatum . (18) Sterility: Borax and Conium are the medicines most in repute: the for - mer is said to be indicated by the co-existence of an acrid leucorrhoea, the latter is suitable to depressed ovarian activity. (5) Cancer : Some of the apparently scirrhous formations are developed in consequence of a blow upon the breast; many of these, whether they might have finally resulted in open cancer or not, are readily cured and caused to disappear entirely by the exhibition of Conium maculatum . (14) Grimmer mentioned about conium as drainage and canalized remedy for breast carcinoma. Dr Cowper - waite mentioned about indurations, scirrhus where sharp, lancinating pain was present. (19) In all the scir - rhous affections of the breast, womb or other parts the pains of Conium maculatum are burning, stinging, or darting, and may make one think of Apis mellifica, other symptoms must then decide between them. (12) Discussion It was small literature review regarding Conium maculatum but many indications and clinical verification are there in the homoeopathic literature. Here co-relation of anti-inflammatory action of Conium maculatum in research study and its curative role for various types of inflammation in homoeopathic literature provide a sound scientific basis for the action of Conium maculatum . Similar thing was observed in case of research study about role of cancer in Conium maculatum and its corresponding homoeopathic use of cancer by various Pioneers like Guernsey and Grimmer. So, it is helpful to study the medicine in context with recent research to understand the logical reasoning regarding the action of medicine. Conclusion The above mentioned homoeopathic data and research studies support the role of conium in female disorders. Its well-known use in tumour as well as lesser-known utility in prolapse of genital organ provide useful information regarding the action of conium as well as open the door for further clinical verification of this multitasker drug named Conium maculatum of conium maculatum extract against cancer cells in vitro: Drug DNA interaction and its ability to induce apoptosis through ROS generation.

Intro duction Since last 14-16 months, COVID 19 has kept the whole world on its toes. A pandemic of this magnitude in 21st century was far from being imaginable. All the 219 countries and territories have followed different trajectories regarding number of cases and deaths. India, facing the second wave, stands next to USA and Brazil in maximum number of COVID cases. India has to caters to a population of over 135 crores, there is approximately 1 doctor for 1445 Indians. For patients, such as this one, suffering from life threatening comorbidities, lack of hospital beds, poses additional challenge. Therefore, in a country like India, homoeopathy has a larger role to play in prevention, treatment and management of COVID-19. Case history Patient's name : Mr. M.A. Age: 68 years. Sex: Male. Marital status : Married. Socio-eco nomic group : Middle. Religion : Muslim. Occupation : Retired from job Weight: 77 kg. Height: 5'10\" Prese nting complaints Breathlessness < slightest exertion since 2 days. Initially slight breathlessness since last 6 days Cough with whitish expectoration since 4 days Swelling over both feet since 4 days Moderate fever since 7 daysAbstract: Background: COVID 19 is presently a global threat with over 169,268,157 confirmed cases and over 3,515,697 deaths worldwide as reported by WHO. Since no country, economy or healthcare delivery system was prepared to face calamity of this magnitude, there is still acute shortage of hospital beds and emergency services and here is where homoeopathy offers to help. Material and Methods Randomised controlled single blind study. Pre-diagnosed case of COVID 19 was taken up. The inclusion criteria for the study were COVID-19 RT-PCR, Rapid Antigen Test kit, HRCT-Thorax. Results The SpO2 level, symptoms and investigations of patient improved after Homoeopathic treatment. Conclusion Homoeopathy can be extremely effective in managing COVID 19 epidemic and serves as the first line of treatment. July 2021 | The Homoeopathic Heritage | 47SPECIAL COVID-19 SECTION Excessive weakness Sensation of tightness in chest History of presenting complaints Few days back his daughter in law was tested positive for COVID. He was extremely worried for her. He himself developed moderate fever in next 2 days. He got himself checked with rapid antigen test kit for COVID which detected as positive. He started with the usual prescribed government protocol for COVID. On 5th day of taking Azithromycin tablets he started having breathlessness and his SpO2 started to drop gradually. His cough and congestion too worsened. He was advised oxygen intubation and hospital admission but since no beds were available his attendants decided to try homoeopathic treatment along with intermittent oxygen intubation at home. Physical generals Appetite: Poor since onset of COVID. Otherwise he was eating normally. Craving: great desire for salty and spicy food ever since childhood. Thirst: Intense and for large quantities. Tongue: coated. Urine: diminished in quantity, non-foamy, non-offensive. Bowel: once, unsatisfactory. Sleep: disturbed due to breathlessness and cough. Dreams: of future events (frequent in past) Perspiration: mild on face and scalp. Non-offensive and non-staining Palms and soles: dry and warm (no heat, burning or sweating). Thermal: chilly Habits: non-vegetarian. Addiction: Nil.Physical constitution The patient was tall and slightly obese with pot belly. The skin was dry and smooth. Past history Hypertension since 20 years, controlled with medication Diabetes mellitus since 20 years. Taking medicines with poor control. Chronic renal failure since 5 years.

Rest of systemic examination was normal. Family history Mother - Diabetes mellitus Father - Hypertension Description of patient and life space investigations: The patient was born and brought up under normal circumstances in a joint family which is why he always wanted to be surrounded by people and had anxiety on being alone. He was in a government job where he worked with honesty and dedication. He was mild and never quarrelled with anyone. But he is very faint hearted and cannot see anyone suffering and keeps on thinking about them. The patient had been suffering from hypertension which was fairly controlled but his blood sugar remained uncontrolled despite taking medicines. 5 years back, he developed swelling over feet and on investigation it was found that his creatinine was 1.7 with moderate albuminuria. Diagnosis This was the case of pre-diagnosed case of COVID19 J12.82 and pre- existing chronic renal failure N18.9, confirmed through investigations attached.[9] Investigations HRCT THORAX (21-04-21): Viral aetiology likely COVID with CO RAD 5 highly suspicious for COVID 19.

The patient lacked the fastidiousness of Arsenicum album though he was fond of bathing, unlike Sulphur. He had no liking for fats ruling out Acidum nitricum and Sulphur, further. The patient also la cked the irritability of Natrum muriaticum and had been calm and composed throughout life under almost all circumstances. Therefore, there could not have been a simillimum better suited to the patient than Phosphorus .[4] (repertory chart attached) Date of follow up Symptoms Additional comments Prescription 19-04-21 First Prescription Phosphorus Q1.5 drops once every hour. 22-04-21 The patients SpO2 rose from 86 to 90 with intermittent intubation, which was their main concern. His breathing was also better. Mild grade fever still persisted from 99 to 99.4F. Cough, expectora - tion, Tightness of chest were also better.Since Dr Hahnemann said about 50 millesimal potency (Footnote 155 Aphorism 270) that unlike centesimal, while using 50 mil - lesimal scale, the simillimum may be given for months, if nec - essary. (Aphorism 246). Since the patient was showing signs of improvement, the same medicine and potency was con - tinued.[5]Phosphorus Q1. Contin - ued 5 drops once every hour. 27-04-21 All symptoms were better. There was no fever. SpO2 rose to a maximum of 92 without oxygen intubation. Same prescription was con - tinued.Since the patient showed signs of further improvement, the same medicine and potency was con - tinued.[5]Phosphorus Q1. Contin - ued 5 drops once every hour. July 2021 | The Homoeopathic Heritage | 4906-05-21 The patient reported much improvement. SpO2 was now stable at 95. Since ap - petite returned to normal and weakness was also bet - ter, China officinalis 30 was stopped. It was assumed the Phosphorus might also bring down the liver enzymes fur - ther. The following The blood reports of the patient showed improvement and it was necessary to bring down the cre - atinine even further. The patient had already taken 0/1 potency for 17 days, it was decided to contin - ue with next potency. Therefore, Phosphorus 0/2 was given.[5]Phosphorus Q2. Contin - ued 5 drops once every hour. 16-05-21 All symptoms were nearly normal. SpO2 now was 96 but reached 98 at times.Since the patient showed signs of further improvement, the same medicine and potency was con - tinued.[5]Phosphorus Q2. Contin - ued 5 drops once every hour. 22-05-21 The patient reported on phone that all his COVID symptoms were normal and his SpO2 was around 98 - 99 throughout the daySince he wanted to continue treatment for albuminuria, raised creatinine, Phosphorus was continued and patient was advised to get his liver enzymes rechecked. He was advised to get creatinine and urinary albumin rechecked time to time..[5] Phosphorus Q1. Contin - ued 5 drops once every hour. SPECIAL COVID-19 SECTION 50 | The Homoeopathic Heritage July 2021SPECIAL COVID-19 SECTION July 2021 | The Homoeopathic Heritage | 51SPECIAL COVID-19 SECTION 52 | The Homoeopathic Heritage July 2021SPECIAL COVID-19 SECTION July 2021 | The Homoeopathic Heritage | 53General management The patients was advised breathing exercises and to lie in prone position. He was asked to take light but nutritious food. All cold food, cold drinks, sour, oily and spicy food were restricted. Zinc and vitamic C tablets were asked to be continued. He was advised intermittent oxygen intubation whenever SpO2 level dropped below 92 or patient had any difficulty. He was asked to continue his previous medication he was taking for hypertension and diabetes. He was regularly counselled on phone to maintain positivity as many of his friends of his age group had died. Conclusion The global death rate of COVID is 3.9% but the pandemic has assumed Frankenstein proportions as no country in the world was prepared to accommodate so many patients at the same time. Just as this case, homoeopathy offers ray of hope to almost all stages of patients of COVID-19. It has been found to be extremely useful in prevention of COVID, in the initial stages of disease where there are mild symptoms, in the later stages where there are breathing troubles such as this one, in cases which are critical and hospitalized and those having post-covid illnesses. We need more cases being treated by homoeopaths to be documented and published so that homoeopathy can be established as first line of treatment rather than alternate or complementary. The burden of healthcare on the hospitals of modern medicine, especially in these times, can definitely be reduced by timely intervention of homoeopathy. References 1.

ISBN: 978-81-319-0385-8 | ` 145 | 240 pp 54 | The Homoeopathic Heritage July 2021Homoeopathic solution to the problem of lactation in mothers Lactation describes the secretion of milk from the mammary glands and the period of time that a mother lactates to feed her young. The process naturally occurs with all post-pregnancy female mammals. In humans the process of feeding milk is also called breastfeeding or nursing.[2] Breast milk is thought to be the best form of nutrition for neonates and infants.[1] Breast milk provides ideal nutrition for infants with vitamins, proteins, and fats that are more eas - ily digested than formula. This dy - namic fluid provides a diverse array of bioactive substances to the devel - oping infant during critical periods of brain, immune, and gut develop - ment.[2] It contains antibodies that help ba - bies to fight off viruses and bacteria. It provides immunoglobulin (IgA), white blood cells, whey protein (ly - sozyme and lactoferritin), and oligo - saccharides. Breastfeeding helps to minimise the risk of asthma, aller - gies, ear infections, respiratory ill - ness, bouts of diarrhea, and the risk of diabetes and obesity to baby.[3] Milk production is regulated by the maternal hypothalamus and pituitary gland-derived hormones. Oxytocin and prolactin are the main hormones that play the role of milk production and the resulting letting down reflex.[3] WHO recommends breast feeding for the first 2 years and exclusive breast feeding for first six months. [4] Even though breast feeding is a natural process, many mothers feel different difficulties during breast - feeding like low milk supply, too much supply and other issues with lactation[1]. Probable causes One of the causes of difficulty during lactation is decreased formation of milk due to the failure of mammary glands to develop fully.[2] Another cause is inhibition in milk let down reflex due to the hormonal or psychological cause such as first- time pregnancies in young women, produce anxiety or nervousness which may restrict the mother from being relaxed enough during the process of breastfeeding and phases difficulty in allowing newborn to suckle. In such highly stressed fe - male, adrenalin is secreted which in - terferes with the hormone oxytocin, which enhances milk let-down.[2] Homoeopathic remedies can be par - ticularly helpful for the most com - mon breastfeeding problems arising due to any psychological or hor - monal causes as homoeopathy treats the patient as a whole. The homoeo - pathic medicines are fast acting and completely safe for the baby and mother without any adverse effects. Diagnosis Breast examination should be done to note any discolouration, swelling or pain or cracks in the nipples. A proper case taking should be done. Homoeopathic remedies Here are the following few impor - tant homoeopathic remedies which are helpful in solving the problems during lactation and breastfeeding . 1. Agnus castus - Agalactia, with sadness. Deficient secretion of milk in lying-in women. Deficient or suppression of milk in nursing women.[5] 2.

SUBJECTIVE 56 | The Homoeopathic Heritage July 2021Chronic anal fissures with sentinel pile - a case report By Dr Shweta B. Nanjannavar, Dr Susmi S. Kunju Keywords: patient [pt], placebo [pl]. Intro duction \"There are wounds that never show on the body that are deeper and more hurtful than anything that bleeds\". Anal fissure is an elongated ulcer in the long axis of the lower anal region.[1] It is one of the very common annoying condition seen, which heals off easily and remains unnoticed in most of the cases, yet require a serious intervention due to the immense pain it causes during defecation, which also alters the emotional balance of the person affecting the QOL. It also poses a great difficulty in carrying out day today activities, hence being one of the major causes of perianal pains. Constipation, which is an unsaid neglected reality in majority of the people is one of the major causes which remains as an accessory symptom throughout their life. Constipation has different concepts in various mind. For some, it simply means undesirable passage of stools whereas in some people, it is one of the most dreadful feeling of agony due to straining. It has been proved that constipation is the primary and sole cause of initiation of anal fissure. Other causes are: Passage of hard stool Faulty bowel habits and lack of local hygiene In females, it is usually triggered during pregnancy followed by childbirth. Inflammatory bowel disease- colitis or crohn's disease, venereal infections[1][2] The annual incidence of anal fissures based on a recent study was 0.11%.[3] On the basis of another study con - ducted in south India (Bangalore) in a hospital setting, showed the prevalence between the age group of 15-40years as 15.14%. The preva - lence is higher in than in males.[4]ICD classification of anal fis- - sures is not entirely clear. It is prob - able that an acute injury leads to lo - cal pain and spasm of the internal anal sphincter. This spasm and the resulting high resting anal sphinc - ter pressure leads to reduced blood flow and ischemia, which results in poor healing. Unless this cycle is broken, the fissure will continue to persist.[6] Clinical presentation The primary symptom of anal fissures is burning pain during and following the bowel movements with great spasm of the anal sphincter muscle. The pain can be so severe that patient might be unwilling to have a bowel movement, resulting in constipation and even faecal impaction. Bleeding in small amounts which consists of blood streaks in the stools and a slight discharge may also occur Abstract: Aim: Anal fissure is most painful and dreadful feeling of agony which adversely affects the quality of life of people of any age group with stressful life style, with relapses in conventional treatment strategies. It was intended to evaluate role of individualised homoeopathic treatment in anal fissures. Methods: Present case is a female patient presenting with intense pain and bleeding from the anus from last one month. She was diagnosed as anal fissure with sentinel pile based on history and physical examinations. Constitutional treatment was given following proper homoeopathic principles and regular follow ups done in suitable intervals. Result: A marked improvement was observed during various visits with progressive change in the condition assessed by the presentation and changes in VAS scale during the course of treatment. Conclusion: This case report suggested that homoeopathy can provide an effective, safe and non-surgical treatment for Anal fissures without any relapse improving the quality of life of the patient.CASE REPORT July 2021 | The Homoeopathic Heritage | 57in fully established cases.[1][2] Bleeding per rectum where in stools are Slimy, bloody with musty, mouldy smell. Nausea and gagging before stools with prostration.[7] Diagnosis Wide, raised edges, Skin-tags(sentinel pile) at the distal end of the fissure. Hypertrophied anal papillae at the fissure's proximal end. Digital rectal examination is done in case if the diagnosis is uncertain or to exclude a suspected underlying pathology. Because of the intense pain it causes, digital examination of the anal canal is not advised unless: The fissure c annot be seen The clinical findings are not clear or if the symptoms persist even after adequate treatment In early cases, the edges of the fis - sures are impalpable, but in fully established cases a characteristic crater which feels like a vertical but - ton- hole can b e palpated.[1][6] Conservative Management Increased dietary fibre intake Drink plenty of fluids. Warm bathing of the perineum(sitz bath)[1][6] Case history A 60 yr old female patient attended outpatient department of A.M Shaikh Homoeopathic medical college, Belagavi with complaints of pain and tenderness in the anal region along with bleeding per rectum since a month. Pt has a frank dark red bleeding of few drops after stools with streaks of blood along with the stools. Burning sensation in the anus for 2-3 hours after stools. Pain in anus aggravated after passing stools and ameliorated by cold application. Pt gives a past history of chronic constipation with unsatisfactory stools since her second pregnancy and would on and off complain of anal fissure for which she was under conventional mode of treatment for the same with advice for sphincterectomy. She had the history of complaints started since her second pregnancy and since then on and off complaints of constipation with burning per anus. Mental sphere: Pt was working as Headmaster at a Primary Govt School and now retired. she always preferred the surroundings to be very neat and tidy at school as well as at home.

Anal fissures that started during pregnancy was the key indicator of the case . Kalium carbonicum was justified with Haemorrhoids, was in close scoring with Kalium carbonicum under repertorisation but was not covering the key indicating feature of the case. Prescription The patient was prescribed Kalium carbonicum 200 3 doses once a day, with placebo for 2 weeks. She was advised to stay hydrated and have a good fibre diet. Since the patient had a severe pain in the anus with bleeding, she was asked to review back within a week if she had any aggravation. She belonged to sedentary lifestyle with only functional changes, no deep-seated pathology was appreciated in the history and on examination, hence 200 moderate potency was selected at an interval of 15 days. The repetition of doses was done considering the acute state of the disease as explained in aphorism 248. Pain in anus was so severe and sensitive that it was hindering the QOL of the patient. But after the third repetition, the patient was totally free from pain.[13] Treatment Follow up with applicability of VAS scale Date Observations VAS score Remedy 2/11/2020 Frank dark bleeding during and after stools with streaks of blood with stools.

Stools- Regular and normal Pt. says her complaints are better by 85% 2 Kalium carbonicum 200 Pl for 1 month (4-0-4) Discussion The mode of treatment adopted by the conventional medicine for anal fissures with sentinel pile according to the recent studies is surgical sphincterectomy, which is effective in healing anal fissures but later develops fecal incontinence in the patient. Various other methods like glyceryl trinitrate ointment, botulinum injection, anal dilatation, cauterisation are also used but they lead to further problems like headaches, flatus and fecal- incontinence and also relapse of the complaints[14].The current case justifies the efficacy of homoeopathy by considering man as a whole, with a blend of both mental and physical generals considered under the prescriptive totality. Here VAS scale is used to assess the improvement in the patient at every follow-up. [15] Photographs for assessment of improvement of fissures with sentinel pile were not taken due to patient modesty and denial. The key feature of the case was complaints of anal fissures started since pregnancy which disturbed QOL of patient since many years and was always palliated by conventional therapy. As homoeopaths we believe that our tenets are based upon the law of nature and that we are the possessors of the only positive system of cure in existence.[16] Conclusion The present case study reviews the most common anorectal disorder, anal fissure with sentinel pile using VAS scale for outcome assessment which is the optimal tool for describing pain severity or intensity. Anal fissure is one of the very frequent and painful proctologic diseases. Even though anal fissure is not a major life-threatening disease, yet the unbearable pain in anus, affects the QOL, hence homoeopathy offers the safe, rigour, effective and permanent treatment, for such cases.

McCallion K, Gardiner KR, Progress in the understanding and treatment of chronic anal fissure, Postgraduate Medical Journal 2021 Dermoid cyst of ovary treated with bd - twice daily (bis a die), outdoor patient department (OPD), ultrsonography (USG) Intro duction Dermoid cyst develops anywhere in the mid line of the body where embry onic fusion take place like at outer angle of the orbit, behind the pinna, below the tongue, ovary etc. [1] Dermoid cysts of ovary are usually unilocular and generally grows about 15 cm in diameter. They are benign cyst teratoma or mature cyst which is a type of germ cell tumors. It may contain sebaceous material and hair. [2] They are also termed as benign mature teratomas, the most common primary ovarian neoplasm. It is more prevalent in 20 to 40 years of age group. Most patients with dermoids are asymptomatic and these are very slow growing cysts, but chance of torsion of ovary, rupture and peritonitis, spillage of contents, bowel obstruction or malignant changes scare.[3] Ultrasound is frequently used and highly effective modality for the diagnosis of a dermoid cyst. [4] The laparoscopic approach is considered to be the gold standard for the management.[5]Homoeopathic aspect: There are plenty of articles mention success - ful treatments of ovarian cyst by homoeopathy, but rarely any article is available on treatment of dermoid cyst particularly. Case study A 37 year-old married hindu female attended outdoor patient department (OPD) with the following complaints: Scanty menstruation which was persisting for 2 days only since 6 months. Backache especially of lower part which were constant but increases during menses History of present complaints: She was taking treatment by an allopathic (private) practitioner since two months for her menstrual abnormalities and backache. Ultrasound of whole abdomen on 22.08.2020 revealed that there was \"a dermoid cyst in left ovary measuring 5.4x4.7 cm in size\". (USG1). Although patient felt some symptomatic improvement in her backache by allopathic medicines but she was afraid of surgery. She approached Homoeopathic OPD in order to get a second opinion and in hope of painless recovery by homoeopathy. Past history: Nothing specific Family history: Father was suffer - ing with hypertension, Mother had gastritis. Personal history: Patient was a home-maker and mother of two children. Her appetite was good and has strong desire for sweets; thirst was adequate; bowel movement was regular and but has urgency for stool in morning since few months. Stool is of thick consistency. Urine was normal, there was no burning or pain; scanty sweat mainly in axil - la without any strong smell or stain. Her sleep was sound and refreshing. Thermal reaction of patient was hot. She was very religious lady and less interested to talk with anyone and anxious about her health. Mental generals: Religious, don't want to talk with anyone Physical generals: Low back pain which < menses during Menstrual history: Scanty flow and Abstract: Dermoid cyst of ovary is a benign mature teratoma and a common primary neoplasm of ovary. Although, it is a slow- growing tumor and most of the patients are asymptomatic, it needs active attention because torsion, rupture and spillage of contents or malignant transformation may occur. Surgical modalities are the standard line of treatment in such cases. Homoeopathy provides a safe, prompt and effective management strictly based on individualization. A case of dermoid cyst of ovary sized 5.4x4.7 cm of a 37 years old female patient has been mentioned below which was treated successfully with homoeopathy. After thorough case taking and repertorization, an individualised homoeopathic medicine brought a rapid and significant improvement. Ultrasonography report was taken as standard document to compare the efficacy of treatment.CASE REPORTARTICLE July 2021 | The Homoeopathic Heritage | 61short duration only for two days since 6 months but regular.Analysis of the case: The case was thoroughly analysed and the charac - teristic mental generals and physical generals were assembled for evalua - tion and finally totality was framed for repertorisation. Table 1: Contains evaluation of symptoms, totality of symptoms, and miasmatic analysis of symptoms Evaluation of symptoms: Totality of symptoms: Miasmatic analysis of symptoms: [6] Mental general religious religious - psora Religious taciturn - syphilitic Taciturn scanty menses scanty menses - psora Anxiety for health short duration short duration of menses - psora Physical general low back pain < menses during desire sweets - psora Scanty menses desire sweets low back pain < menses during pseudo - psora Short duration of menses morning urgency for closet morning urgency for closet - psora Desire sweets Low back pain < menses during Urgency for closet Thermal reaction- hot Repertorial analysis: Case was rep - ertorised by Repertory[7] us- ing RADAR 10.0 software. [8] Medi- cine which came out (Table-2) Discussion: Patient responded well to the homoeopathic treatment and very soon sign of improvement was marked. Morning urgency for stool improved first followed by some re - lief in backache. Medicine was given in high potency as it distinctly cov - ered many symptoms (both men - tal and physical) and seemed to be simillimum. After a considerable period of wait and watch, potency of medicine was raised because low back pain during menses was still persisting. When patient felt complete relief in her problems for which she had approached to OPD first time, i.e, scanty menses, back - ache and morning urgency, it was decided to review the case from specialist at higher centre for proper guidance in further treatment be - cause medical literature mentions that dermoid cyst of ovary may be asymptomatic. So, patient consulted at Dr. RML Hospital where ultra - sonologist found \"no significant abnormality\". Thus, h omoeopathic treatment provided her an economi - cal and painless cure not only for dermoid cyst but other problems with a single medicine. This case of dermoid cyst of ovary is considered to report because a decisive role of homoeopathy is seen here for ef - fective, painless and rapid manage - ment of case. Conclusion This case shows that dermoid cyst of ovary can be treated successfully by homoeopathic treatment. It reconfirms the homoeopathic principle of cure on the basis of individualisation and holistic approach. Financial support and sponsor - ship: Nil. Conflict of interest: None declared. References 1.
