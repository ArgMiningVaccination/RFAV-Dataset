We offer personalized in office and telemedicine services for individuals, families, and small businesses. Rejuvenating IV vitamin infusions are also available. Our goal is to help you achieve Balance of mind, body and spirit! A good life is about Balance. Unfortunately, healthcare has very little of it. In 2018, I had the crazy idea that healthcare didn't have to consume the family or business budget; there could be a balance in providing quality healthcare at a reasonable price. It didn't have to be exclusively allopathic and pharmaceutical based either. I knew that I wanted a provider that offered whole food supplements, vitamins, minerals, and lifestyle changes, rather than pressuring me to take an expensive prescription medication. One that believed in Chiropractics and Acupuncture-not just muscle relaxers and pain medication. I knew that I wanted a provider that would spend more than 10 minutes in the room with me and actually listen to what I had to say. I knew that I was interested in holistic treatments and had an open mind to alternative healthcare modalities. I knew that I wanted a provider that believed in the power of prayer and would...possibly...(GULP)...even pray with and for me...So, if I wanted those qualities in my provider, did others? Did that provider, could that provider, possibly exist?!? I didn't know. What I did know was, that was the kind of provider I wanted to be. That idea eventually became the first DPC practice in Temple, Texas, providing care for individuals, families, and business sponsored employees. I am very proud of what I created and helped to accomplish in those first few years and now I'd like to share what I have learned. Come, let us help you find balance with affordable, personalized healthcare and revitalizing, immune building infusion therapy at Balance Integrative & Infusion.
