White sage leaves with good shape are selected and the candle is designed with two layers, side and inside, with white sage placed on the side. Of course, everything is handmade by candle craftsmen. Luxurious white sage essential oil is blended in the candle to create a gentle fragrance even without lighting the candle. The candle can be lit for a long time, paying attention to the swinging and melting of the flame, returning the wick to its original position when it becomes unbalanced, and extinguishing the flame when it is in good condition. etc. The process of making candles to one's liking while enjoying their care is called \"nurturing candles. In Japan, candles are still rarely used in daily life, but in Denmark, there is a word \"hygge (hygge)\", which means a way of using time, a way of living, and a way of thinking. It is a word that expresses how to use time, how to live, and how to have a good heart. It is a word that expresses a cozy and relaxing time, and the \"sense of happiness\" that can be felt by creating such a time. Busy days. The unchanging daily life. Lit a fire at the end of such a day. Please experience with this candle the \"time to change yourself\" that LUCAS wants to convey. The candle is made of soy wax (100% natural ingredients) and is a \"MUKU\" standard product in consideration of the natural environment and safety. *Please be sure to read \"How to Grow Candles\" and \"Precautions. LUCAS soy candles are made so that as they burn, the center of the candle is concaved, leaving a wall embedded with white sage and illuminated from the inside. In order to use the candles beautifully until the end, if you extinguish the flame in a short time, only the center will melt deeply, leaving the surrounding area behind. The candle should be kept burning for about 2 hours, leaving a 1.5 to 2 cm wall at the edge. How to grow candles well If you put out the flame in a short time, only the center of the candle will melt deeply. Light the candle for 30 minutes to 2 hours, leaving a 1.5 to 2 cm wall on the wall. If there is a hole in the wall, the wax will flow from there. Always keep the wick straight and centered. If the wick is off-center, extinguish the flame and then use a special tool or tweezers to return the wick to the center. Do not blow on the flame when extinguishing. Use a special tool or tweezers to dip the wick into the melted wax and extinguish it to prevent soot from forming. (Always return the wick to its upright position immediately after extinguishing.) When lighting again, cut the wick to a length of 5 to 6 mm to adjust the flame to the proper size. For safety reasons, the candles are manufactured to extinguish when lit to about 2.5cm from the bottom, but do not use up the entire candle. The wax and essential oil used in these candles are 100% plant-derived. Even after curing, the wax and essential oil are not completely fixed, so they are constantly aging due to changes in room temperature and air pressure, and cracks and blotches of color may appear. Please enjoy lighting them in your daily life and use them as soon as possible. For example, on the night of purification day. Light a candle and meditate/do yoga amidst the fragrance of white sage and flickering flames. You may feel a sense of time passing more slowly than usual, and you may feel a deep sense of peace and tranquility. LUCAS candles will add color to this special time. There is also a \"gummy candle\" with a beautiful transparency and natural stones that are soft like gummy bears. We recommend these candles for interior decoration. Please use it as a gift for your loved ones. All products at the LUCAS main store come with \"free simple wrapping\". The wrapping in the image is for reference only.
