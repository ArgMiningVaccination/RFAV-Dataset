You will find different types of articles described below. We are constantly developing new content so please revisit this page often and share our content with those who may be interested. Science Corner showcases articles that are geared towards helping consumers and young professionals better appreciate the relevance of the scientific method, learn about concepts relevant to all aspects of scientific inquiry, and become more inoculated against pseudoscience in all its forms (so as not to be harmed by the influence of poor science and information that appears to be \"scientific\" but is sadly not). To this end, and since not everyone has a scientific background, we will often showcase shorter articles because we believe knowledge leads to more informed decisions....and more informed decisions lead to better outcomes for children and adults with ASD.
