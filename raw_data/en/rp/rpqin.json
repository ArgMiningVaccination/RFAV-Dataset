Active immunity can arise naturally, as when someone is exposed to a pathogen. For example, an individual who recovers from a first case of the measles is immune to further infection...

(See vaccine.) Sterile filtration usually removes large microorganisms (e.g., bacteria, fungi, and their spores) from heat-sensitive solutions, but this physical method does not effectively remove small infectious microorganisms...

Once stimulated by a vaccine, the antibody-producing cells, called B cells (or B lymphocytes), remain sensitized and ready to respond to the agent should it ever gain entry to...

The first method is used following specific exposures that carry a high risk of infection, such as using needles contaminated with HBV particles, the ingestion of body secretions likely to be infected, or the...

However, routine immunization in healthy people is also recommended. Advances in scientific understanding of influenza and vaccine...

Of particular interest was a vaccine made of attenuated P. falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ). In 2013 PfSPZ demonstrated early clinical success in protecting healthy volunteers against malaria. Individuals who received the highest doses of PfSPZ gained the highest levels of protection.

International efforts led to a significant reduction in measles cases and deaths, bringing global elimination of the disease within reach. At the same time, supporting this progress, many wealthier countries, including the United States and some countries in the European...

The safest and most effective vaccines are human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV), purified chick embryo cell culture (PCEC), and rabies vaccine adsorbed (RVA). With older vaccines,...
