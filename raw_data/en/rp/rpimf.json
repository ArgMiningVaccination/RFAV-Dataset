The immune system within your body is what protects you from all the attacks of various microbes from the world outside. However, the immune system itself can face problems and can defend the body only so much. Thus it is wise to add some homeopathic medicines and help the immune system fight the possible intruders better. Let's have a look at some of them: 1. Gelsemium: This medication is extracted from the vine Gelsemium sempervirens, and is known as a very effective remedy when you have [flu](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/flu) like symptoms with the cold such as, exhaustion, [body ache](https://www.lybrate.com/treatment-for-body-ache) and [fever](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/fever). 2. Arsenicum album: A very well known remedy for [food poisoning](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/food-poisoning) as well as other [digestive disorders](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/digestive-disorders), Arsenicum album can be very effective in treating a wide variety of stomach related illnesses caused by the reaction to foreign microbes. 3. Oscillococcinum: This medication contains trace amounts of duck liver and heart and is known to be a good immune booster. Effective in the cases of cold and flu like symptoms, oscillococcinum can effectively treat fever with flu and other symptoms, although it may take a bit of time for it start acting. It is thus best to consult with a homeopathic doctor before starting a course. 4. Allium cepa: If you have flu like symptoms with teary eyes and [nasal congestion](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/nasal-congestion), Allium cepa is a very good remedy. You have to take a few doses before the symptoms start subsiding. One dose contains three to five pellets and you might have to take about two to three doses daily for a couple of days for the symptoms to subside. 5. Combination medications: There are multiple medical combinations, which can help you boost your immunity as well. Consult your Homeopathic doctor to get the best combination for your specific condition. Some of these combinations are: - Calcarea Carbonica 30- 1 dose, [Phosphorus](https://www.lybrate.com/lab-test/phosphorus-fasting)- 1 dose & Lycopodium 30 - 1 dose: This combination is very effective in treating sensitive [colds](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/colds)where fever may or may not exist but causes extreme nasal blockages. - Lycopodium 30, Sabadilla 30: This combination is very effective when the cold and nasal blockages are due to pollen sensitivity and occur during the pollinating season.
