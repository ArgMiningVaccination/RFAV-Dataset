Introduction Primary Health care is well reputed and peer reviewed international journal that exposes the scientific community and the general population to various developments in the field of primary health care and public health. The currently released volume no 6, issue 4 comprises of research articles, case report, review articles and a commentary. Shrivastava et al. has briefly described the horrible situation of gender-based violence worldwide and precisely in Ukraine. After explaining the various impact of the violence in different aspects of a woman's life, it was explained that how the United Nations Population Fund is assisting the survivors of the gender-based violence by offering them humanitarian assistance and aid to manage the various problems faced by them [1]. Sharma et al. conducted a study to ascertain the cause of poor immunization coverage in an urban area of Delhi, India and even proposed cost-effective recommendations to deal with the existing challenges. It was observed that 87 children were incompletely immunized in the study area and extensive impetus has been given on the need to have sustained efforts to improve the awareness of community regarding immunization and to periodically train the health care workers to ensure maintenance of appropriate records [2]. Firdaus et al. discussed about the various conventional therapy and complementary and alternative (CAM) supplements usage for the management of hepatitis (Warm E Kabid) through a systematic review. Due emphasis has been given on the classification of the condition into sanguine, billious, phlegmatic and malencholic and the need to have a holistic approach for the management of the same in the system of Unani medicine [3]. De performed a cross-sectional study to assess the nutritional Status of adolescent girls in the age-group of 10-19 years by means of measurement of mid-upper arm circumference in the rural area of Paschim Medinipur, India. The findings of the study indicated a statistically significant relationship between the mid-upper arm circumference and the body mass index of the study participants [4]. Rivas-Estany performed a review to highlight the scope of physical Exercise in the prevention and rehabilitation of cardiac patients in the primary health care system of Cuba. It has been emphasized that to maximize the outcome of physical exercise in relation to the quality of life, morbidity and mortality of patients with cardiovascular diseases, it is of utmost important to develop an exercise regimen focussing on the type of exercise, intensity, duration, frequency and individualization [5]. Burke in his commentary pointed out the frequent incidence of violence and abuse in health care settings, especially against the nursing staff. In-fact, due to a rise in the occurrence of such events, negative consequences on their job satisfaction, performance, impairment of the psychological & physical health, and desire to quit their job has been observed. However, due to the uncertainty to decide a way to respond to these experiences, nursing staff has been targeted for years together. Furthermore, it has been reported that most of the interventions implemented with an aim to minimize workplace bullying have been quite effective. [6]. Nilvarangkul et al. conducted a multi-method study using questionnaires, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions in the four provinces of North-eastern Thailand with an aim to explore the challenges to primary occupational health care service for informal sector workers. The results obtained from the study revealed the lack of policy and budget support for executing such services. It was recommended that in order to ameliorate the primary care services for worker health and safety, there is an i`ndispensable need to formulate stronger policy directives, budget provision and management support [7]. In his commentary, Koch et al. highlighted the involvement of neurological systems in micturition. Simultaneously, some of the common conditions which can present with symptoms of urge incontinence in the primary health care set-up have been discussed. In addition, the aetiology of the same has been explored and emphasis has been given to promote research in the field of pelvic floor [8]. Xu et al. conducted a study to clinically evaluate the effect of ultrasound-guided thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) on postoperative analgesia in patients with breast cancer after radical mastectomy. It was observed that the opioid consumption in and the incidences of nausea, vomit and chronic pain in the TPVB group was significantly lower than that in the control group [9]. Dai carried out a study to investigate the prevalence of internet addiction and positive psychological health among Chinese college students and to explore the relationship of positive psychological health and internet addiction. In excess of 800 students were enrolled for online survey based study, which included the PERMA scale and Internet Addiction Test. The results of the study indicated that positive psychological health was affected by internet addiction negatively; and provided a better understanding on the positive psychological interventions in reduce internet addiction among Chinese college students [10]. Akanbi et al. did a cross-sectional study using both quantitative and qualitative approaches to ascertain and analyze the individual factors contributing to the prevalence of teenage pregnancy among teenagers assessing Naguru teenage centre in Uganda. It was extremely shocking that 40% of the teenagers accessing Naguru teenage centre were pregnant, and individual risk factors like educational level, age at the start of contraceptives, sexually active siblings, and history of siblings ever got pregnant were having an association with the teenagers' pregnancy. There is a great need for the government, stakeholders, community leaders, teachers and parents to focus on sensitization, monitoring, and counseling activities to intensify on various means of reducing teenagers' pregnancy [11].Holistic Health Saurabh RamBihariLal Shrivastava Department of Community Medicine, Shri Sathya Sai Medical College & Research Institute, Kancheepuram, IndiaCitation: Shrivastava SR (2016) Holistic Health. Primary Health Care 6: e118. doi:10.4172/2167-1079. 1000e118Page 2 of 2 Volume 6 Issue 4 1000e118Primary Health Care , an open access journal ISSN: 2167-1079 Alexander et al. performed a prospective field prevalence study with an aim to assess the proportion of adult women suffering from URTI that reported cough-induced urinary leakage. The study revealed that 53% of women visiting their family physicians with upper respiratory tract infections simultaneously had one of their complaints in the form of urinary leakage. Further, women that experienced urinary leakage with URTI almost never complained about urinary leakage to their caregivers. Thus, it was concluded that urinary leakage is a frequent troublesome symptom of URTI, and still it is largely underreported. Thus, it is the responsibility of primary care physicians to inquire about urinary leakage among female patients presenting with URTI [12]. Abah et al. in his study investigated the prevalence of Plasmodium malaria and ABO blood group among blood donors in Y enegoa, Bayelsa State, Nigeria, as it is a malaria endemic region. The prevalence of malaria infection was determined using standard parasitological method and ABO blood group was done using the monoclonal antisera A, B, and D. The results indicated that 36.4% of the donors had the infection, and that blood group O+ had the highest prevalence with 42.9% followed by blood group A+ with 41.9% [13].
