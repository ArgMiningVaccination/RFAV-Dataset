Acupuncture Many insurers offer coverage for acupuncture. We are not directly billing insurance at this time, but we can provide you a receipt that you can use to submit for reimbursement. Private Acupuncture Individuals receive care in a private room with soothing music, lighting and comfort items like blankets, pillows and bolsters. The privacy and length of appointment allow you to work more closely on issues and apply treatment methods anywhere on the body. Treatment may include cupping, gua sha or electrical stimulation, as appropriate and agreed upon, in addition to acupuncture needles. Once you've had private acupuncture, you can consider combining private treatments with community treatments to fit your schedule or for a more cost-effective treatment plan. Community Acupuncture Individuals receive care in a group treatment room with soothing music and lighting while fully clothed and seated in a comfortable recliner chair. Screens between recliners allow for safe distancing and a sense of some privacy. Treating the full body can be accomplished by accessing the lower legs, arms, head and neck. Please wear clothing that allows for easy access to these areas. Treatments are staggered with that of the others in the room. Some claim that treatment effects are enhanced because of the group setting. You are welcome to bring items that help you relax such as a blanket, pillow, headphones, eye pillow, etc. Please arrive 5-10 minutes before your appointment to allow the practitioner to stay on schedule. Auricular Acupuncture for Weight Loss and Addiction (N.A.D.A.) Are you trying to lose weight, quit smoking or curb another type of addiction? Auricular (ear) acupuncture can be an effective solution. It can aid in the treatment of a variety of health conditions while also reducing stress and increasing one's overall well-being. Treatment consists of 10 sessions spaced over approximately 2 weeks. Facial Rejuvenation Acupuncture Acupuncture facial rejuvenation involves inserting needles into the face and body to help stimulate blood flow, increase the production of collagen and elastin, and shed dead skin cells. It can help reduce fine lines and wrinkles, age spots, sagging jawlines, acne, rosacea and puffiness around the eyes. Treatments also incorporate gua sha and facial cupping to further aid in these results. Call for information about contraindications and side effects. Chinese Herbal Medicine These private appointments are the initial step to using Chinese herbal medicine to manage chronic conditions. After your intake appointment, any herbal prescriptions will be filled at an external herbal pharmacy for an additional cost. A follow- up appointment with your practitioner after 1 month will be necessary to evaluate effectiveness. Frequency of follow-up appointments will be assessed on an individual basis.

Body and Energy Work Massage Therapy Massage is a form of bodywork that can help you maintain and achieve overall health and wellness, recover from injuries and promote healing. The licensed massage therapist will individualize the massage to meet your needs. Specialized treatments include pregnancy, cancer and mastectomy massage (physician referral required for specialty massages). Lymph Massage Using very light circular motions, a specially trained licensed massage therapist stimulates the lymph system to help it work more efficiently to drain fluid and reduce swelling. This massage is beneficial for people with cancer (physician referral required), fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome, and those recovering from a sports injury or surgery (particularly plastic surgery), when lymph vessels become overwhelmed with the demand placed on them.Please note: this is not manual lymph drainage. Integrative Reflexology Integrative Reflexology\u00ae involves massage of the feet, hands or ears at specific points to promote relaxation and well-being. Reiki Reiki is a non-invasive, powerful process, administered by a certified Reiki Master, that involves the practice of moving energy to increase the body's natural ability to heal. Reiki can be administered while you are fully clothed or as part of a massage. It involves the practitioner using gentle touch or placing hands just above your body to help guide energy in a way that promotes healing.
