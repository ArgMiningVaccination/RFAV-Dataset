What is Divine Feminine Energy? When we talk masculine and feminine energy, it's important to note that, unrelated to gender, these energies are a completely separate concept. We all hold within us both feminine and masculine energy, each with their own traits. Masculine energy is that which drives competitiveness, anger, strength, dominance, and desire. The Divine Feminine is the nurturing energy that we each possess. The qualities associated with feminine energy on the other hand, also known as the Divine Feminine, include the following: - Intuition - Compassion - Love - Wisdom - Creativity - Empathy - Sensitivity The Divine Feminine is the nurturing energy that we each hold within us, and is sometimes also referred to as Gaia, Shakti, Kali, Yin, or Inner Goddess energy. The Power of Divine Feminine Energy While the Divine Masculine can be credited for helping us to be assertive and take action in life, embracing and honouring the Divine Feminine is vital for maintaining emotional wellbeing. When there's a disconnect from the Divine Feminine, it gives rise to an imbalance of energy. It can sometimes be necessary to tap into one energy more than the other to help us accomplish goals in specific areas of our lives. However, due to their nature, masculine traits can easily overpower their feminine counterparts. When this situation occurs and there's a disconnect from the Divine Feminine, it gives rise to an imbalance of energy. Practically, this might look like: - Hopelessness - Lack of purpose - Aimlessness - Feeling uninspired - Inability to tap into intuition - Relationship problems - Aggression When the Divine Feminine is active, you'll notice the opposite is true. Life will feel positive and easy. You will feel inspired, creative, and hopeful. You'll experience a sense of purpose and female empowerment. In fact, studies have shown that placing value on femininity and self-worth is positively linked to physical health [1](https://manifestinghumandesign.com/feminine-energy-crystals/#Sources).

[Solar Plexus Chakra affirmations](https://manifestinghumandesign.com/solar-plexus-chakra-affirmations/). What the Science Says Crystals are undeniably beautiful and possess ethereal, mystical qualities. But can they really be used for inner healing? According to science, yes and no. There's no evidence to suggest crystals carry healing properties. However, that's not the whole story, because in some circumstances they have still been shown to have a healing effect on the wearer (or used in meditation practice, etc). How can this be? The placebo effect. A study on crystal healing by C.C. French had fascinatingly positive results [2](https://manifestinghumandesign.com/feminine-energy-crystals/#Sources). It was presented at two international conferences in 1999 and 2001 but never published in a peer-reviewed journal. In the study, 80 participants were given either real or imitation crystals. Only 6 volunteers reported no effects from the crystals, with a staggering 92.5% claiming they felt a 'change in energy'. The cause of an improvement in mood, health, or circumstances doesn't matter; it's the improvement itself which is of value. What's so significant is the conclusion these results suggest: the likely explanation for such a notable outcome lies in the placebo effect. But that doesn't make the results of the study any less important or worthwhile. The placebo effect is powerful and valuable in its own right, and can be a great way to support your wellbeing. Ultimately, the root cause of an improvement in mood, health, or circumstances doesn't matter; it's the improvement itself which is of value. With that in mind, so long as you remain realistic and don't try to use gemstones to replace medical advice or treatments, then there's no harm in introducing crystals for manifestation as a wellness and self-care ritual, alongside proven methods.
