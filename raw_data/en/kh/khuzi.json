I would like to suggest revamp on MTK as it seems to not have much merit compared to the other stars while it requires more effort and cost. The only merit of having MTK would be showing luxurious visual effect and wealth of your character. Plus, more players perhaps could be attracted to farm and grind at Neo Tokyo. Here are some suggestions: Increase weapon attack of MTK from 30 WA to 31 WA Increase amount of MTK to 1.5-2k stars when fully charged Thank you for reading and please share "}
