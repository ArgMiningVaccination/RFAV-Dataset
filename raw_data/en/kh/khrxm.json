She c ertainly know s who she is. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I have many persons to thank for their help. Fir st I must include my main e ditor, wife and suppor ter, Bonnie. She sat through s o many rea dings, and questions that I begin to wonde r why she didn't run out of patienc e. Others in my family also helpe d greatly. U pon reading some ea rly page s, Rob ble ssed me wi th two books on writing. This was much better than just telling me that I neede d to improve or call it quits. My s on-in-law Shu's ideas regarding structure, plot development, a nd relationship with my reade rs greatly improved e arly drafts of the manuscript. His hus band (who is also my son) J osh's comments determined a number of twists in the final structur e of the novel. My daughter, Sa rah, made a few telling comments that I have certainly not have properly a ddress ed. But t hen ag ain, pe rhaps that is true for most of the criticisms t hat others have give n as well. I can't le ave w ithout thanking my ex cellent writing teache r, whom I s hall le ave na meless at this point . His many - alw ays constructive, but not alwa ys subt le - criticisms included such telling phrases as \"You mea n I've been rea ding for all this time and all tha t happened i s that your guy parked the ca r?\" Hopefully, he will c ontinue to judge my w ork destr uctively . Two other fr iends who have also been generously supportive and unsparing in their criticism mus t be named: R obert Bein and Barbara Cristy. Numerous others including all the know ledge able me mbers of our neighborhood book group, have rea d and criticiz ed one or another of the many previous drafts of this novel. I thank them for t heir input. Finally, I must mention the suppor t I have receiv ed from the Washington Crea tive Writers Club - perhaps better known as A Table in the Back - the writers' group that meets at B read and Chocol ate. Da vid the group, has been exc eptionally helpful. But all the members have be en very supportive and collec tively they formed a community that has given me confidence . I could not have w ritten it without this villag e of suppor t. They are all wonderful companions who ce rtainly deserve none of the bla me for the s hortcomings that are st ill contai ned in the manuscript.

The Bach sonata wa s silence d. Only the whi ne of the failing eng ine, the c langing of the exhaust pipe, and the vibrations fr om the road were le ft to fill the void. And then he saw it. Wha t grabbed his attention, wa s the s ign: SHARPSBURG ARSE NAL! LAST CHANCE ! BEST PRICES IN MARYLAND! GUNS, AMMO, CIVIL WAR MEMORA BILIA! NEXT LEFT T URN, THEN 300 Y ARDS A HEAD Marc had occ asionally passed the sign before, but paid it no mind. Howeve r, this Wedne sday morning, the sign caught his eye . Or was that his convenient distort ion? Perhaps he had c hosen this r oute to follow the sign to its implied solut ion to his pr oblems. One can, of cours e, neve r untangle the thousands of neurologica tions a man's mind to unders tand ultimate c auses. But here he was, the Profes sor, in a tunnel of fea r, imagining a n exit. Might the venerable Prof essor Marc Butt ervogel buy a gun? He, whose onc e loving w ife, Elsa, like so many other students, had been attracted to him a s a crusader for peac e and righteousness, was now turning a c orner. He, a responsible reviewer of manuscripts f or Ethics and Mind - he, the one time philosopher of peace , war and e vil - wa s he ready to kill? Yesterday's threats by Vera a nd Frances to tur n him over to the police ha d caused him to panic . He had started off this morning on his f rantic exit, driving far too fast. But now, the a drenaline w as wearing off, and with it his attention tur ned to his mass ive hea dache . He brushed off t he pain to the press ure he wa s under. I t was debilitating and made him feel much olde r than his 77 years. His driving began to reflect his diminished self. As he now aime d at 'The Arsenal,' he slowe d and rode the brake l ike so many of the ag ed-still-dr iving. Marc justified his extreme caution by noting that the roads were slick with slush, \"Perfect weather for an acc ident.\" But they had be en far worse when he le ft home and violate d all the posted speed limits. A car pass ed on his left. Sticking his hea d out the window, the drive r screamed, \"Get the the fuck off the road you old shit!\" Another car bega n honking behind hi m. He comple ted the turn. He wa s relieved to arrive in the dirt parking lot of the gray, two-story wooden building. Marc c ut off the motor , and sat. In the moment of intense quiet he tried to regain his composure and overcome the viol ent pulsing in his head. Exha usted, he let go. His thoughts dr ifted. Yea rs ago, he had visited another gun shop. In Istanbul, at the unde rpass near the ferries at Galata Bridge. That visit was out of tour istic curiosity. Elsa had g rabbed his arm and urged him in. She had vie wed the hundreds of guns in the shop window w ith the same sort of repellent curiosity that his vegan sister might have felt toward a la mb carca ss in a butche r shop window. E lsa was alw ays like tha t, pushed by her own maca bre interest in contradictions. It was what had driven he r toward philosophy in the firs t place . These thoughts of Elsa turned to her billowy red and bla ck skirt, her white sleevele ss blouse and long hair. W ith what joy the y had shared their exploration of Istanbul. Tur key w as their best t ime. FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 1Closed W ednesday They ye t lebrating E lsa's just -acce pted-for -publication dissertation, politica l philosophy conference on \"The Poss ibility of the Non-Violent State .\" With the memories of the Galata cross ing, Marc wa ndered further back in time. There was Elsa, entering his life. He ha d supervis ed her dissert ation, eve n while othe rs on the Cornell fac ulty had been a ware of their affair. He knew publica tions f rom dis sertations are neve r automatic. They come much as a cha nce for a close e ncounter comes from t he right costume. Of cours e, the woma n wea ring it must have something to off er. Elsa did. She had bee n 27, long le gged, w ith stunning features . But even then, the wrong dress , fumbled make-up a nd the party comes to naught. Both he and E lsa knew tha t. It was during the last yea rs of the Vietnam w ar and her dissert ation had be en on the ethic s of nonviolenc e. Like he r mini skir ts, she had sele cted the topic to be a lluring and she had found publica tion to be easy. The noise of a passing tr uck pulle d Marc out of his ruminations of details from a life once liv ed. He bega n to refocus on t he here a nd now. First task - regaining the e nergy to make it to the door of the gun shop in Sharpsbur g - Sharpsburg, the gatewa y to Antietam, site of the bloodiest one day battle in Ame rican history. They now say, \"It's hard to hear the gunfire in Sharpsbur g.\" Memories of Elsa left him. He wa s back in his murderous rage, ba ck in the problems of the day. Back with his throbbing head. Just at this point of momentous choice, of potential transformation, he felt his doubts and hesitated. The freezing February drizzl e left him chille d in his car, under the nake d branches of a large be ech tree. Like the small areas of green grass at the edge of the lot, he w as sur rounded by patches of dirty snow. All around were plow ed mounds of old s now pockma rked with mud and sand and ye llowed by urine. The prof essor flitted through the s tale c ast of characters leading to his demise. Identifying the list became terribly difficult. Of course there were more than Vera a nd Frances - there was Julia. But jus t as the other names came cl ose to the sur face, so did the pounding i n his head. How did everything g o so wrong? As if in a fast paced vide o game, the charac ters pr esented themselves as threats and required his attention. B ut as soon as he tried to focus, they disappeared. He could no longer find them. The increasing pai n in his head distracted him. Left unidentified, the cha racters encircle d him, entangl ed him, as if with barbed w ire. Targeted, hunted, he he ard his ears r inging, his blood press ure ris ing. He w as left facing threats that overwhelmed hi m. His vision began to cloud up by the random pattern of dr oplets and flakes that obfuscated his cracke d windshield. To clea r this new a nnoyanc e, he turned the ke y to start t he wipe rs and cle an the glass. But it didn't help. The radio inexpl icably blasted on ag ain, w ith a wild S hostakovich scherzo, a dance with dea th. Marc grabbed at the ke y and turned it off just as the dance leane d into its crazed climax . The wipers st uck at two o'c lock. Marc continued to sit there desperate to locate the e nergy, the c ourage to ac t. He couldn't ge t a grip on his options . A gun w as the great simplifier. Marc gave up trying to foresee its consequence s. He had to go into the long gray building; he had to understand his options , had to make his choic e. Ev en more concretely , he had to fee l a gun in hi s hand. Marc opened the door of his beat up Chev y Cavalier, slowly moved his alwa ys aching hi ps to get out of the car, and slammed the door. A rather large piece of fender rus t, speckled wi th the car's white pa int, fell onto the dirt parking lot, just mis sing the icy puddle gelling to encase the le ft rear tire. He stuck his key into the old wa gon's lock, wa tched the loc k button go down nea r the cracked FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 2Closed W ednesday window, a nd turned toward the stor e. Shive ring, he zippe d up his jacket. He touched the ca r roof to steady himself and gain his bala nce. He bit his lip to mask the headac he, and he aded up the pa th toward the door and the we athered sign to its left s tating \"Sha rpsburg Arsenal: Guns, Civil W ar Memorabilia. Prices you ca n't beat. C losed Wedne sday.\" The old profes sor turned and felt the cold wi nd on his face. He le aned a gainst the old building and held hi s head in his hands to ass uage a sense that his head wa s about to explode. He struggled back to the c ar. As he sank into the seat, he fell ba ck into his memories. FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 3CHAPTER 1: ANGELS AND ROACHES When the shyst ers and do-gooders of the East Coast look for targets, t hey c an do no better than to enter 'blind, widow , alone in apa rtment, monthly lease, land l ine only, ' and hit 'search.' For the shyst ers it would yield the low hanging fruit, t he ea sy pickings that keep c oins jingling in pock ets and bills in walle ts. And for the boy scout crowd, it would le ad to quick me rit badges. But generalities are statistical artifacts. Individuals in a sample neve r quite fit the averages they generate . One such odd ball in tha t prime target set is Vera. A lways wrest ling with, to, her macular deg eneration, V era still gets by. She doesn't ca ll herself blind, though that was the cate gory some thought appropriate. Because they be lieved in truth her parents named he r Veritas. Because Vera c ame to reali ze that her parents had betrayed he r, isolated her, and set her up for ridicule by g iving her such an unusual name, she dev eloped a tough, agg ressively self-pr otective, untrusting veneer. W hen she was in fifth grade, R alph McBride, three inches talle r than she, taunted her and threw rocks at her. He teased her about her name: w as she a boy? What kind of craz y name was Veritas? Certainly not A merican. She lev eled him. That wa s by the bike rack a t school. Even now , more than three quarters of a century late r, she occasionally recalls the satisfaction she felt when she pounced on top of him, grabbed his mop of hair and pulled his hea d up, smashing it down and pulling i t up agai n, stopping only whe n blood started to s pill out on the concrete a nd pebbles. He wa s whining as she looped her leg ov er his s houlders and stood up. She hiss ed, \"V era, not Veritas, you filthy fool!\" a nd walk ed aw ay. A nd with that, her name w as change d in all but the most official records. In late spring 2007, almost two yea rs before Marc went to the Sharpsburg Armor y, a socia l worker on a par with a n Eag le Scout c alled Vera to discuss s upport s ervices. Ve ra hung up. The state's s couting club w ould have to work harder for their victory. Frances Bus sa had expe rienced this s ort of denial many times, and ope ned her appointment ca lendar. Looking for a free hour, she found one on a Thurs day a fternoon in August, and entered 'Veritas Tablea u, Cla ridge House, 2423 Lytonnsville Roa d, Apt. 4F: sight impaired - in denial .' Not that schemers were like ly to have more luck. The kind who e mailed found they never receive d an answe r. Charity haw kers, and financia l salespeople w ere similarly blocke d by a slammed receive r wheneve r they call ed. Vera w as tough. But when, on that hot Thur sday afternoon, Frances rang her doorbell, she had been tak en down a peg. V era had dropped a glass she was carrying to her sink and it had broken into invisible shards on her vinyl tile d, gray kitc hen floor. Such incide nts were rare, but they alwa ys fed her fears of weakness and vulnerability. Now , as in other moments of terror , she slips into silent prayer, \"Lord Jesus , plea se, if you don't see fit to r estore my eyesight, at le ast find s omeone who might help me.\" So she experienc ed a totall y uncha racteristic mix of s urpris e and relig ious anticipation w hen, just a few moments after this f ervent communica tion, she heard the knock. W ith the threat of s harp piece s of br oken gla ss, Vera pla nned her detour around the most likely area of danger, and used her hands on the wall s to guide herself to t he door. Upon arrival at he r destination, so f ull of hoped delive rance, she wa s not her us ual brusque self. FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - aches \"Who is it?\" In res ponse, she heard a friendly, \"He llo, it's Ms . Bus sa, a social w orker fr om Montgomery County.\" Vera ope ned the door. \"I calle d a few w eeks ago, but we we re disconnected, a nd I thought it might be better if I just came by. Here is my county i dentification c ard.\" Frances, knowing full well tha t Mrs. Tablea u wouldn't be a ble to read it, continue d, \"If you don't mind, I'd like to see if I could help you w ith anything. Perhaps I could come in?\" In the middle of that hot afternoon in J uly, the pray ed for miracle from the broken glass led the door to s wing ope n. Vera saw her angel had arrived. \"My lord, you must've come from heaven! An answer to my prayers! Of cours e, don't just st and there, come right in. Help from s trangers, I do say!\" Vera w as renewed w ith energy by this pr ompt answer to her pr ayers, \"Just put your things on the table. Let me show y ou what's wrong.\" She was pointing to a small tabl e whe re Frances could, perhaps, find room f or her checked c anvas and leather purse and briefcase. It was also serving as the pedestal for a rather large coc kroach. Frances ey ed the roach's swayi ng antenna e and look ed for an alternative purse perch. Not seeing the wildli fe, nor the social worker's reaction, Ve ra was feeling her way back a long her path of safety toward the closet that held her broom and dust bin. \"I'd bet you knew before you knocke d,\" she continued w ith a disbelievi ng smile that reflected her new understanding of her privileged position as living unde r the shield of the almighty, \"I broke a glass and hav e trouble seeing. Y ou'd be such an a ngel if you'd j ust sweep up the splinters for me so I won't cut myself.\" Realizing tha t a full search for a safe place for her belongings would take more time than w as now ava ilable , Frances picked V era's sole upholster ed cha ir, laid down he r bags, smiled, and thought 'denia l overcome.' Notic ing a second a ffront to her middle class expecta tions, the foul odor of burnt coff ee, France s looked for t he offender. The old percolator on the counter was unplugge d. Reaching into her social w ork soul s he responded warmly, \" Of cours e, Mrs . Tableau. I'll be gla d to do it. Jus t give me the dust bin and broom. I'll have it up in no time.\" And once no time had transpired, shards were swept aw ay. He lp had bee n delive red; prayers were a nswered. Frances, looking a ngelic and feeli ng comfortably triumphant, then glanc ed around the room. On one wall a butting the kitchen c abinets, above the percolator she noticed a wooden rack that held a set of decorative, or special spoons. On an adjoining wall, with light gree n wall paper printed with yellow roses was an old three-barred Ea stern O rthodox crucifix. Off to one side of the sitting area wa s a table wi th an old Apple computer that looked as if it hadn't bee n used in a while . Frances decided i t was time to turn t o matters of business , \"Now, Mrs. T ablea u . . .\" \"Please, V era. Simply Vera. How can I thank y ou? I am sorr y, but I am really bad at na mes, did you say you w ere Mrs . Buthar? Can I give you some coffee or wa ter?\" \"No thank you. But my name is not quite B uthar. It's Frances, Frances Bus sa, like Sa int Frances of Rome. Not Buthar. B ut why don't you c all me France s? I see you have a computer. Do you use it a lot?\" FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 5Angels and Ro aches \"Oh but you must! Are you sur e you w ouldn't want a cup? It's fresh from br eakfa st. T his morning. Probably still warm.\" Urged on by the offensive odor of the burnt coffee, Frances responded quite emphatic ally, \"No, really, thanks but I s urely couldn't. But now about that computer ...\" \"That was a gift from a neighbor who got a ne w one from her family.\" \"Do you use it?\" \"Well, no. I can't rea lly read such a small screen. I don't know how to thank you. I wish I could give you something, or do something, to s how my gratitude. \" \"That's not necessary, really. Tell me now , how bad i s your eyesight?\" Not fully underst anding the purpose of what she took as a non sequitur but alway s ready to believ e in miracle s, Vera responded, \"The good lord hasn't alwa ys looked after me like he is today, you know. I ca n read large print - like headline s in the paper. And I can see thing s to t he side. The doctor says I have ma cular deg eneration. He says there is not hing to do for it. T hat screen is too small for me to s ee pe ople most of t he time. Sa me as the TV. Eve n if I s it right up to it.\" Frances turned to look a bit more at the room. Surpr isingly, the coc kroach wa s still on the small table. Its antennae w ere constantly and slowly rotating, patrolling its environment. A slight involuntary shudder went through Fr ances's small frame. In a corner, just below where the flowe red wall paper wa s discolored from age and w ater stains, s at the TV Vera ha d spied and a straight-back chair. The TV was an old 1 7 inch model. \"I guess you don't have a dig ital conve rter box.\" \"A wha t? Oh, I don't watc h . . . It's s o hard to watch TV. Sa me as the computer. I just haven' t bothered.\" \"There is a foundation that works with the county. Maybe w e can persuade them to give y ou a grant to upgrade all this. Since you c an read he adline s, we would a sk for a large screen TV and a large c omputer s creen that you c ould use. That could help.\" \"My Lord, what a day this is ! To think, it all bega n with my broken gla ss and then a prayer. And then I was sent a saint! Who sent you Frances?\" \"It's m y job. I work for the county welfare burea u.\" \"Oh yes, so you said. But I 'm sur e it wa s providence that led you to my door at just such a time. I would so like it if you could share a c offee, after all that you ha ve done. I'd mak e some fres h.\" \"Well, all right, thank you. Just a quick one. I still have lots to do this after noon.\" Vera w as sur e that must be so: angels and saints have very few minutes to s pare. Moving as quickly as her corpulent body would a llow, she moved towa rd the electric percola tor. With practiced fee lings by fingers that s ubstitut ed for s ight, she opened the ba g of grinds, f elt around for the measuring spoon s he kept inside it, a nd measured the coffee. She then carefully filled a measuring cup with wa ter 3 times and poured the water into the coffee mak er. Feeling for the plug, she set it t o perking. An ang el deserved her best and so in a similar fashion, using her hands to s ee, she reac hed for her fancy c hina cups. She fel t the rims and chose one w ith care. They a ll were somewha t cracked, FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 6Angels and Ro aches and the sauce rs were chi pped, but with practic e Vera had lea rned to identify the ones in the best shape. They al l still retained some gold on the rim. It was the gold that led them to be inc luded in the small treasure the Tablinkovic hes had struggled to salva ge whe n they fled the old c ountry. She also picke d out one of her st erling spoons from t he specia l little woode n rack on the wa ll, and put it on the sauce r. When the pe rcolator stopped its bubbling, she poured the coffee. Frances sipped, but hardly tasted the coffee. She w as too eage r to escape the depressing environment for her mor e comfortable office qua rters, and wa s forming a grac ious exit. \"Delic ious, thank you. So w hat I plan to do is to get some paper work st arted. Then one of my assist ants will be bac k in a w eek or so. She'll then do a fuller asses sment. If all w orks according to plan, we 'll begin the a pplica tion process for t hat new TV a nd computer. My assis tant will c all you firs t. We will ne ed some luck, but let's try.\" \"Oh yes, try. It would be great to have a larger scr een,\" Vera a dded with a genuine ly happy lilt. Putting down the cup Frances embrace d Vera's hand in he r two as a sincere gesture of s olidarity. She then procee ded to rescue her purs e and briefca se from the sur veilla nce of the coc kroach. As she left, she was happy to have had such an e asy time. Soon, she knew , the county w ould hire exterminators, and the apartment would be spotless ; Tableau w ould be assigned a c ase number that she could hand ove r to one of her s taff. Fr ances now had another story to s hare with her kids over the dinner table to illustrate the powe r of pos itive thinking. And Ve ra? Vera felt blessed. Tot ally blessed and in rapture. How so many things could hav e gone so wonderfully on a da y that had started to fall apa rt jus t was beyond he r. As the door clos ed, she said, once a nd once a gain, \" Thank you, Jesus!\" and then sat down heav ily on her big upholstered chair, le tting out an audible sigh. The draft of her movements was picked up by the scilla on the rear legs of the roach, and it skedaddl ed to safety even qui cker than Frances would ha ve expe cted. FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 7Memories flit into the m ind, emerging from a pa st for just an instan t to justify the present. One, two, three: they beco me a collage. The detritus of our experiences , sticking toge ther like burs, using previously stored shards of our discomforts , cutting one's time into events, g iving pattern to hap penings that float from, a nd then back into, the pa st. CHAPTER 2: MEMORIES As he sat there, in the car, outside the Armory, unsure of his own survival, Marc's memories commanded hi s attention. They were stirr ed up by his fears and pain. They formed dark imag es of past death as they strung thems elves together. ****** A faded oil cloth cove red the table in Marc's parents' kitchen. Once it had bee n white wi th little bright flowers. Like the rest of the apartment, the kitchen w as less t han spacious. His father, Is aac, had once painted the now chipped a nd dirty trim around t he narrow ca sement a cheerful yellow. Looking out the w indow over the kitche n sink, the trim f ramed a section of the blank brick w all across the ally . At age 11, Marc wa s tall enough to look down a nd to the left to see just a corner of the s idewa lk and street. He could e ven vie w the tops of the garbage c ans in the ally . And exte nding himself over the sink, if he looked up, he c ould see a sliver of sky. But now it was Esther, his mother, who was standing by the sink, staring out the window. Marc and Melissa, Marc's little s ister, were sitt ing on either side of their father at the kitchen table. Isaac was in his army uniform. His heavy duffle lay by the front door . Mom had made a special brea kfast of F rench toast. But it was not a morning of celebration. Breakfast was silent. Meliss a was deep into her maple syrup and her gloom whe n father said, \"Esther, what do you say, gorgeous? I'd love another cup of coffee before I go.\" \"I wish you weren't going , Isaac,\" w as Esther's respons e. It came w ith her immigrant parents' German acce nt. Although born here, Esther st ill used a slight 'v' in he r pronunciation of words that bega n with 'w' w hen she was anxi ous. Hers was an E nglish at the side of her mother and on the str eets of the lower East Side. Listening closely he could still reca ll those faint roots in his mind. \"Someone ha s to knock out Adolph and those krauts. I t might as well be me .\" Mom pour ed the coffee. \" Ja, but other fathers aren't getting sent to Europe. They seem to stay State-side,\" she said sadly. \"Well my fortune's diff erent,\" wa Isaac's respons e. \"You be sure to write, whe n you get a chanc e. Don't forget us.\" \"How coul d I for get my family ?\" father r esponded with a big smile for t he children. He extended hi s arm to hold Est her closer but s he broke loose and turned bac k to the window. Marc recalle d details of this 67 year old eve nt as if it was yesterday. His dad rubbed Marc's head and adde d, \"And y ou all w too.\" FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 8Memories \"Of course we will - we all w ill. W e're going to miss you terribly. What wi ll I do without you, Isaac? Isaac. Don't volunteer for any dang erous mis sion. No heroics. Stay safe. Promis e? Just finish t his war and get ba ck home,\" Esther s aid quie tly, alw ays facing the window. \"Are you two k ids going to write me? I'll be miss ing you two bumpkins. And y ou Esther. God, I'll be missing you. What do y ou say Marc? Meliss a? Are you going to write?\" The siblings were st ruck dumb, trying to underst and. \"Melissa, don't pout like that. I'll be bac k before you finish your Fr ench toast if you ea t it that slowly. I'll get ba ck here pretty quick - just got to catch A dolph's tail before he kills too many more of us.\" Marc's father t urned back to the c offee, downing it in a gulp, grabbe d his duff le and g ot up. Going to the door, he put his hand on the knob. The rest of the family ha d followed behi nd him in silence. Tea rs flowed down E sther's chee ks. Meliss a and Marc w ere stone-s till. Isaac walked out the door with the duffle in his hand. The three followed. \"Now kids, I've got to go.\" This time, Daddy w as leavi ng the building i n his khaki woole n army uniform and it wasn't for training. He di dn't express any qualms. There he was, draping E sther's back w ith his arms . Then they just held eac h other for a long time. When he let her go, he w as laughing at something they had said to ea ch other. He then stopped and said, \"There is nothing to worry about.\" But t hey a ll knew he wa s going off to war. Suddenly, Marc couldn't hold bac k. \"Don't go. Daddy , don't go.\" With moveme nts he had long perfected, Isaac reache d down putting one a rm around M arc's waist, and the other around his shoulders , picking him up and putting him on his shoulders . \"You know I've got to go, Son.\" \"No you don't! Jimmy's dad isn't l. go!\" Marc reca lled how he screamed, \" NO!\" over and ove r again. Marc's father t ried to ease his son down fr om his s houlders but M arc fought back. He kicke d and held on to his father's hair. Finally, Isaac succ eeded in plac ing his son gently next to Meliss a on the col d top st ep by the front door, and said \"Take ca re of Meliss a; she's your little sister. Remembe r you are alw ays going to be he r big brother! And help your Mom. M om's boss while I'm gone , but she's going to need those big muscles you've got. Y ou are going to have to be the man in the house!\" Then with another quick move Dad had Marc ba ck on his shoulders . This view is alway s in Marc's mind. He recalls, from up there, the top of his sister's head; his mother's eyes - reddene d by crying; and that final e ndless s woop down off the shoulder onto the s tep. He often relives that swoop - how his Dad turned Marc ups ide down a s he was swung down and then how his permanent replac ement, a l ifeless duff le bag , went up in a n arc done w ith the same simple swing of his f ather's st rong arms. T his is always followed by father going down to the street. He neve r looks back. Nev er comes back. He never holds Marc agai n. Marc was left there next to his little sist er, herself s tanding bow-le gged, not long out of diapers, and not quite comprehending that the day' s pleasant departure was apoc ryphal: Daddy was lost and would not be home a gain. FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 9Memories ****** Thoughts about the loss of his father are alwa ys tied to Jake, Jake Trowley. Even be fore the war ended, inde ed, in Marc's memories, almost immediately a fter his father left the st oop, Jake took his father's place. Of course that's not quite r ight. Marc can a lways recall the horrible afternoon when coming home from school he heard Melissa cry out, \"Daddy i s lost. Daddy is dead. \" And then the service. E veryone c hanting the Ka ddish, \"Yit'ga dal v' yit'ka dash sh'mei raba.\" But dead w as thousands of miles away . For M arc and Melissa, Daddy was absent. Then one night, the new ma n just appeared. E sther declared Jake a new 'fathe r.' But he wa sn't. Marc recoiled a t the sight and smell of this new ma n. Some horrible switch had occ urred. A pariah ha d come into their apa rtment - chosen by Marc's s uddenly unc aring mother, some substitute picked up from thos e who didn't go to fight the wa r. And whe n Marc complaine d, Mom replied, \"You'l l learn to love him. Jake vill he lp us now. He has money.\" Marc heard the words Esther had alwa ys said to Is aac now said to Jake: 'Da rling,' 'Love,' a nd 'Dear.' W hen he visited, Jake would sit in father's chair. Jake wa sn't J ewish. Marc wa s soon in tow to church. Marc's father wasn't mentioned. Then, one day , Mrs . Butter vogel be came Mrs. Trowley. The family moved to a muc h bigger, upstairs f lat on Mulberry Street. And Marc's half brother , Michael, was born. Tr owley was in finance . He had hi s own company. They lea rned quickly tha t he was not a good ma n. But it was too late. Where w ere they to go? Jake neve r liked Isaac's children. They w ere too often angry, and the stepfather never could forgive or unders tand their ange r. They never got along. For M elissa and Marc, their daily task was to st ay out of the way of his anger, his fists , his feet. Jake wouldn't budge t adequa tely for thos e children. But M ichae l got everything. Nothing seemed possible for Isaac's son. Eve rything was ava ilable for Michael. Michael g ot praise. Marc got blame. Micha el could do a nything, Marc wa s a witless do- nothing. And a lthough Marc graduated c um laude in hi gh school, Jake w ouldn't suppor t Marc's going to colle ge. The memories s tirred old ang er, new fury, and c aused Marc's temples to pound ever more terribly. Marc sat there, s uddenly fee ling himself spinning uncontrollably into a black vortex, a space detache d from t his world that previously had such a grip on him. FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 10CHAPTER 3: SUPPORTING CAST When the sky is pr operly gray a nd pregnant with rain, the bounda ries between it and the endless county office building s in Rockvill e disappea r. One of thos e modern ceme nt tombs contains the Montgomery County Office of Disability Service s. On the thir d floor ther e is a small window less cubicle occupie d by Margery Whi tman. She is one of Frances Bus sa's interns . When a ssigned to work with Buss a, Margery felt fortunate. Her profes sors at the University of Maryland's School of Socia l Work had spoken of Ms. B ussa's magnifice nt record of s uccessful struggles within Disability Services. Many of those str uggles we re wage d for her vulnerable clie nts. Of cours e, others were over purely bureauc ratic matters incomprehensible to thos e outside the government. But oft en, and c ertainly that summer, those victories had allowe d her to accumula te interns. Once she arrived, Margery discovered from the gossip around t he office coffee ma chine, tha t many others believe d Mrs . Bus sa was every bit the saint that she had he ard at the Unive rsity. Frances seemed to poss ess boundless energy a nd time to bring her cases to her s upervisors . As we might expec t of county officials overseeing disability services for the elderly, they quickly signed off on such things as r equests f or exterminators . More s pecifica lly, they also gave her permiss ion to set her summer interns t o do whatev er they could to a meliorate Ve ra's s ituation - as long as it cost no county funds. Much as Fr ances had foretold, the appointment of Margery, had been fortuitous. M argery's was no aca demic succe ss story. It followed that Margery nee ded some sign of merit on her resum\u00e9. With but a month or so left in her inter nship and a semester in her MSW program, s he wa s desperate to acc omplish s omething positive. But M argery had c onsiderable assets of her own. She w as the granddaughte r of M artha Whitman, a wealthy matriarch of local renown. Whe n Grandpa George w as alive the couple w as known for the luxurious bas hes they hosted as benefactors of pr ogress ive ca uses. Grandmother M artha's early dia gnosis of macula r degeneration did not obscure her keen e ye. She wa s renowne d for her acute judgment of generationa l slippage of her descenda nts: a fact not lost on M argery. Martha saw her grandda ughter as her only (albeit slender) hope of avoidi ng the inevitabl e social e ntropy others refer to as 'r egression to t he mea n.' Indeed, from M argery's perspective, her Grandmother's obs ession was indelibly e xperience d as an esca lating ge neral conc ern . This compuls ive preocc upation first manifest its elf when Margery's Uncle Charles began to drift downward. Grandparents Mart ha and George be came poss essed with one cause: e stablishing a family safety ne t. They established the Whitman Foundation to secure respectable employment for Charles. Indirectly The Foundation also pursued the preservation of eyesight. Mirroring her Uncle C harles' trajectory at the Unive rsity of Maryland, in lavish bashes, frequenting countless fr aternity parties. Near the end of the la st semester in her 6- year quest t o obtain a de gree, she discovered that her bac kground in partying adv antage d her neither for pos t-graduation employment nor for fur ther schooling. Indeed, Margery wa s pollinated by so many reje ctions fr om graduate programs and job opening s in physical educ ation that a g reat interest in good ca uses blos somed within her. FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 11Support ing Cast Finally, w ith some aid from t he family Founda tion, she settled in for a deg ree in social w ork at the University of Maryland. And now, after a couple of years of education, a s things unfolded that day in 2 007, Margery wa s called into he r bos s's office. \"Are you e njoying y our interns hip so far, M s. Whitman?\" Frances asked, opening the conversation. \"Oh yes, thank y ou. The orientation program has been really awesome.\" \"Good. But that is not why I have a sked you in. W e nee d to have a shor t discuss ion.\" Frances emphasized the importance of what she wa s about to s ay by leani ng forward in her chair. Her breasts hovered now low over her desk. She wa s looking str aight in the e yes of Margery, who wa s standing in front of the Director's des k. \"You should know I hav e an e xcellent plac ement record for my best interns. T hose that perfor m best r eceive my strongest r ecommenda tion. They alw ays get satisfactory employment upon their graduation.\" \"Wow . I hadn't even thought a bout that. But now that you bring it up, a solid recommendation would ce rtainly be a wesome.\" \"Recommendations have to be earned, Marge ry. Is n't Martha Whitman your grandmother?\" \"Yes.\" \"She ha s done some wonderful things in this county. Especia lly to help w ith macula r degene ration. She eve n set up a foundation. Do you know a bout her work for the poor sighted? \" \"Of course. You know, she suffer s from the disease herself.\" \"As I thought,\" interr upted Mrs . Bus sa. \"I want to discuss a case with you. I recently ini tiated a file on a ne w clie nt, a woma n call ed Ve ritas T ablea u. She suffers terribly fr om macula r degeneration. She live s a much reduced life, but some electronic tools could improve her situation greatly.\" \"Wha t do you mean?\" \"Well, a la rge flat screen for T V and c omputing, magnifying software, a nd so on. I'd like you to see if there could be money available from any local c harities, foundations or merchants to s ubsidize or even secure such equipment to improve her life. C heck it out. Then, in a few day s get back to me.\" Upon lea ving the office Margery immedi ately called her grandmother. This was not unus ual. Margery sought her Gr andmother's advice be fore s etting out to accompli sh anything more important than attendance at a fraternity party. Martha made i t clea r that Margery was to come to her Grandmother upon leaving w ork. Soon Margery was seated in Grandma's parlor. It was a formal room. T he dark parquet floor was covered w ith tightly wove n Pers ian rugs adorned with blood red floral designs. Martha was sitting in a rather vertically backe d antique English wing -chair. The upholstery was a rather severe slate gray ve lvet that we nt well w ith her own high nec ked front butt on dress . Margery was seated fac ing her grandmother and the wi ndow to the side ros e garden.

Then perhaps I would not have had a ll this res ponsibility.\" \"Yes. I am s o sor ry to tr ouble you a gain. But I need to find out what to do.\" \"Pay a visit to your Uncle Cha rles at The Foundation. He may ha ve some idea s.\" After som e plea santries, and som e social bon-mots, Margery left for the family's foundation. When properly a sked, Cha rles' blindness association is capabl e of charitable works. And it had just been asked. As its founding benefactor, Grandmother Mart ha had j ust called C harles at The Whitman Foundation to a lert Charles to the urgency of the situation. Margery travele d down FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 13Support ing Cast Kensington Parkway to a beautifully restored Victorian from the 1920's. The garden wa s known for the beautiful old be ech a nd oak trees, the roses on the south s ide of the house, and the a zaleas on the east and north. But t his wasn't a tour of Kens ington gardens. Margery wa s dropping in on her dear Uncle Charles, to r eceive a profes sional boost. She beg an tea rfully, \"Uncle Charles, what can I do? I have faile d at eve rything.

He made it clear that the ass ociation w ould be happy to match dollar for dollar any gi fts that they might be a ble to secure for her client. He also made a mental note to ask Martha wha t the Foundation should do if Margery could find no job after graduation. These s imple steps were suff icient to ensure that after the roaches left Apartment 4F, the retailer who donated the newe r PC with the latest vision enhanci ng software was paid full retail price for t he relatively large screen, hig h-definition TV that was included in the bountiful gifts bestowed upon Vera a ll before the summer had gone.

Ha d that been the end of the tale, a nd had not Profes sor Butt ervogel liv ed next door to Frances Bus sa, all w ould have been w ell in this little corner of Mont gomery County . FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 14CHAPTER 4: NEIGHBORHOOD TREMORS Like many of W ashington's liberal profess ionals, Frances lived in the onc e bucolic subur b of Takoma Park. After its f ields morphed into subdivis ions, it voted itself a 'nuclea r free zone.' Still later its electorate voted to impea ch President B ush. Fr eed of their atomic a rsenals, neig hbors were able to rea ch out to help ea ch other in times of need. Near the County community colle ge, on Tulip Ave nue, sit a row of neat Vic torian two stor ied homes, all more than 70 y ears old. Little more than the frequent pass age of nearby rushing metro trains dis turb this peac eful neighborhood. March 2008 and the y ard at 106 Tulip wa s as pr egnant with spr ing as Frances had bee n yea rs ago with Christopher, her fir st bor n. Daffodils pus hed gently against the bulging brown belly of the earth. Crocuses punched their hea ds into its crust t o be let out. A bulg ing purple-heade d preemie bloss om appea red sur rounded by a la st patch of s now in the shadow of the big oa k tree that dwarfed the front por ch. Sca ttered parts of a disass embled broken c hild's bicycl e on the porch lent the home a Norman Roc kwell aura. For young Christopher and his litt le sister, Sarah, meal time a t 106 was a ma gical stor y-telling time with a c ommon plot: Rescuing the ne edy a nd the elderly of the C ounty, Super-Mom could do no wrong. The theme neve r flagged. The two young sters had lea rned that the world was a dange rous place in the fortunate care of their mom, Fr ances. Directly to the ea st of 106 wa s another Victorian: ye llow a nd white, a bit in need of a pa int job. Its gutter thr eatene d to disconnect, but otherwise it was quite presentable. The ya rd was less manicured. No c rocuses were waiting to be born. Meal time at 104 tende d to be solitary. Prof essor Buttervogel a te canne d and frozen micro-wave d food. Meals were alone , often in his underwear, his face c overed with da ys of s tubble. But t here too, life had be en comfortable bac k when c itizens had faith that ba nks were stable and good plac es to put their m oney. That wa s also when the old Profes sor believ ed the dang erous world was being k ept at bay by Julia Burnham. Burnham wa s now Lambert. And a mother. But in his mind she was neither. Burnham was an old flame first, a financial a dvisor s econd. Burnham wa sn't the Pr ofess guardian. Profess or Buttervogel's agreea ble exi stence wa s also suppor ted by his generous neighbor. The profes sor and the social worker had long gotten along. W hen Marc moved in, she ha d invited him over for a supper. T hat repast served as foundation for an amiable relationship. From t ime to time, she looked a fter his houseplants, newspapers and mail. For his part, he colle cted her pac kages when they we re left on the stoop by the delive ry men. He ha d flirted with her a few times, but nothing was meant to come of it. Marc was more than 30 ye ars her s enior. Anyhow , a single mother, Ms. B ussa had he r hands full with two children. Now, quite suddenly the de ep foundations of the American politic al economy were g iving birth. And this newborn was not benign. Tremors traveled from st reet to st reet acc elerating w ith the aid of the internet. Foundations were developing invisible crac ks that would lead to famili es losing their savings, and then their homes, and eve n worse. Banks were shaking. The epice nter was Manhattan. Neighbo rhood Tremors Then, one fateful Friday, 200 mile s to t he Southwest of Gotham, on Tulip Avenue, the monster showed its head with a sudden outburst. That same Fr iday e vening, France s came home from work. She pulled he r neat Honda miniva n into the driveway she shared with her neighbor. She helpe d the kids with its door s. Arms laden with groceries, she ambled into the house. He lping the kids off with their jackets, she turned on the evening news. Hangi ng up her coat, she notice d her newly graying ha ir in the hall mirror and thought about whee ling the recy clables' bin back from the curb. Lost in her many fac eted reali ty - fresh evidenc e of aging , what to do about supper, rolling the blue rec ycle bin down the drivew ay - Frances absorbed none of the black tidings from the T V. She rema ined unaw are of the tremors from Wall Street. On the other side of t he drivewa y, the ev ening he adline s arrived to a different audie nce. Marc sat tr ansfixed by the da rkened screen of the television he ha d just tur ned off. Rea l news isn't only about the large scale ha ppenings in the world. It is also about neurological shifts in the minds of those hearing it. Cha nged ex pectations. Bear Stearns, a compa ny that hea dlined the da y's news because it collapsed. This news change d Marc's expectations. His entire nest-egg was held in a n account at the company . He bega n a pani cked stream within himself, \"I could lose ev erything. My money. My ho me. Everything. All my savings are there. This co uld be a ma jor disaster! Wha t can I do? How c an I get my money out? What's going to happen to me? My finances are unhi nged! Bear Stearns! I have to co ntact Julia .\" Like a squirrel that suddenly stops and cha nges direction, he snapped hi s TV bac k on, to search for mor e information. Perhaps he hadn't heard right. But no, the same news was repeated - endlessly. Inst inctively , he reac hed for his cell, and dia led his hired financia l defender. \"You ha ve reac hed the office of Julia Burnham Lambert and Associates, Financial A dvisors . Our bus iness hour s are 9 to 5 Monday through Fr iday. If you know the extension of the party you wish to reach, you c an dia l that now. To leav e a me ssage . . .\" His blood pres sure rose. His anxiety esca lated. He slammed down the rece iver and screamed to no one, \"Shit.\" Marc searched for her home or cell number. He we nt on line to find it. Nothing. A panic ked minute pa ssed before he real ized tha t he probably ha d her cell numbe r on his phone. Sure enough there it wa s. But s he didn't pick up. \"Ca ll me, it's urgent,\" he beg ged her voic e mail. Hours later he finall y hea rd from her. \"Marc?\" Remnants of her Texan roots were still audible in her voice. It calmed him. He e ven ga ined a short lived smile recogniz ing her. \"Julia. I'm so glad you c alled back. \" \"Sorry about that. I had to put the kids to bed. What's up?\" \"The news about Bear Sterns is terrible.\" \"Right you are.\" \"I know I have my a ccount with y ou, but I think my money and saving s is being he ld at Bear Sterns.

I wasn't making light. It just s eemed true. W e don't know e nough yet to predict wha t will ha ppen to your money. Y our money is probably safe even though they went bell y-up. Look on the web - there has bee n a posting by the SE C or the Federal R eserve - sor ry I can't recall which.

But I don't think that will ha ppen. Try to get some sleep. Nothing ca n be done till Monday in any c ase.\" \"My finance s could be wipe d out. I'm not as s ecure a s you, Julia. This means a lot to me. It's no small matter. You're going to he lp me, won't y ou?\" \"Hon, I'm alwa ys here for you. That's why y ou pay me . But now, I've got to go. Get some sleep, Marc. Things will be brighter and perhaps cle arer tomorr ow.\" A nd then, Marc heard her hang up. Marc hung on to his cell, motionless. The call wa s over, but not his worries. Still st aring at the blank TV screen, he ruminate d about Julia. \"Julia had been my friend . Friend? Wha t am I thinking? She was my lover . And n ow? She's cheated m e,\" he told himself. But when Marc tr ied this rewrite of his histor y the truth tr ickled in. His mind rebelled a nd snapped bac k to reality. \"Reality? what is reality? \" he fought back. \"I've neve r been a 'realist.' R ealism's ju st a bu ll shit justifi cation of the milita ry industrial comp lex. Truth's the assertion of a free mind.\" But his mind rebelled a nd snapped back to ima ges he reca lled. \"Reality?\" went the other thread in his mind. \"Isn't reality the loss o f your assets ? No invented stories g ive you back your money.\" It won. He reviewe d the steps J ulia ha d taken w hen they ma de his investment decisions. He wa s walking into Julia' s office. W hen he e ntered her fancy w ood panele d office it reflected success and showed just how far s he had c ome from their wild sexual escapa des. That day, as now, he wa s desperate for money. He wanted he r to r ebuild his financia l foundation. He had to a ccept these memories, to r eject his lie. She hadn' t cheate d him. Fault? He knew the answer as he denie d it: he wa s ashamed of his own decisions. He knew she had pa ssed him a clipboa rd with a pen a ttached. She had sat on a cha ir next to him at her big table. Hi s eye wa s on her skirt . It had ris en above her knees, those same knees he love d to touch. When he chang ed his gaze to the clipboa rd it had a pape r on it entitled \"Risk Tolerance Que stionnaire.\" FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 17Neighbo rhood Tremors a ll, he remembe red his r eaction, \"Come on, Julia! Fuck risk tolerance! W e did it without a condom e ven though we knew HIV w as around. And we weren't monoga mous. Hell, we w ere seeing ea ch other even w hen we were both married. We were screwing w hen I should have bee n at my wife's oncologi st. Risk tolerance? Jus t make me a lot of money, fast.\" That's why he had gone to her. He alw ays had trouble with tec hnical discuss ions. He had a math block. He suddenly recal led a humil iating fac ulty meeting more than 1 5 yea rs ago. C harlie wa s making some points about the undergraduate program. Something about the grades of majors in philosophy. The averag e GPA wa s going up. Marc had asked a simple question, and it was met with a rather long silenc e. \"How,\" he had asked, \" can a student get a GPA of 3.6 when w e grade w ith whole numbers. You know, an A g ets a 4, and a B gets a 3.\" Cha rlie took the question slowly, and said something about ave rages and addi ng and divi ding. Marc suddenly bec ame a ware of the ignoranc e he displayed. It wa s devastating. No one asked him to join them for lunch. For weeks, after the meeting w as over, he avoi ded conve rsations with his faculty and felt isolated by the public display of his limitations. So he had dropped into Julia' s office. He could neve r have bee n so honest with any one else. He could al so have tried to contact his half-brother, M ichae l. Michae l was also a fina ncial advisor. Michael w ould have given him some assistance. But how could Marc have expla ined his situation to his younger half-brother? Of cours e it wa s his fault that there was no diversity in his port folio. Surely, he ha d been myopi c. But he went to Julia whe n he wa s a desperate soul: retired and suddenly without the financia l assets that were nee ded to sus tain his lifestyle. As he revisited those memories , he reca lled the c auses of his desperation. \"My first big los s was from Elsa's sickness and death . The medica tions were n't cover ed and care cost so damn much. And then, a fter she died, m y work just tanked. I couldn 't even make ends m eet. Elsa was no longer there to get me grants. How co uld I save for retirement? Eve ryone was ma king money hand over fist in the stock market while my savings dwind led. Did nothing. Zap. It couldn't be so difficu lt to make real m oney - e veryone was doing it.\" So then he ha d opened a day-trader acc ount at Schwa b. Sure enough, he made a pile, a nd quickly reinvested it in Enron, MCI, and some small high tech c ompanies. By 1997, Marc figured he had enoug h to retire. He was 66, and set for life. Jus t after he left the university to s tart his new life, the tech bubble burs t. He wa s hit hard. Very hard. Suddenly , Marc didn't have e nough to suppor t himself. He went to Julia. Over the next yea rs, she had done w ell by hi m. It was now hard to admit, but he was reaping the rewards of his own overly risky beha vior. Owning his own history was depress ing of course, but it also calme d him down. And a s the evening turned to night, he rela xed, a nd other memories of Julia ca me to mind. September 1974, the semester was beginning and he had barely arrived at the Unive rsity of Maryland. Julia Burnham wal ked into his office: blond, buxom, and ba rely 18. His future wife Elsa was still in Cornell, w aiting until the ne w year to come to Maryland. Boxes of books were lying on the floor of his office, wa iting to be shelved. R ecalling those days brought him great plea sure. What better to dis tract a frightened old man tha n dipping into his youthful conquests. And s o as he brought it to mind again he soothed his frazzled state. \"Can I come in, Sir? I don't want to bother you,\" w as Julia's opener, with her Texan twa ng. \"I surely could come ba ck some other time, if you'd like. \" FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 18Neighbo rhood Tremors \"Certainly, come in. It's not my office hours. Close the door s o others will have to knock . Take a sea t and tell me w hat's on your mind,\" a response tr iggered a s much by her radiant skin as her beautiful cle avage. E ven now, a lmost 35 years later, the memory aroused him. He still held the image of thos e long le gs she dr aped one over the other as she s at in the hea vily upholstered, pea - green vel vet arm chai r in his of fice. Her tartan pla id skirt neatly exposed both her knees and their very trim connection to thighs he would grow so fond of. \"I saw your syllabus on 'The Philos ophical Rejection of Wa r and Vietna m' at the book store. It looks so exciting! I was told it is already ove rsubscribed and closed to freshman. I jus t am hoping I can pe rsuade y ou to let me in. I'd be more motivated than othe r students. I t's so relevant for me. Back home in A marillo, no one que stions the war. I just r eally nee d to be enlighte ned.

What's your name?\" Inadvertently Marc also licke d his lips. \"Julia, Sir.\" she announc ed with a flashed smile and a flic k of her head. The swing of her long blonde hai r grabbed his attention. \"Monday's anti-war rally could give you a quic k study about the iss ues. It'll be in front of McKeldin Library. I'll be there and i f you still want into the course after that, see me right after the rally. A nd Julia, it's 'Marc,' not 'Sir.' \" \"I'll e nticingly . \"I'll try to use 'Marc', Sir but it will be hard for me. In Amarillo,\" whic h from her tongue, now da ncing be hind and betwe en her pea rly teeth, rhymed with va nilla, \" people just use 'Sir' and 'Ma'a m' unless they're real close friends.\" The elongate d roll of the 'real' made hi m smile. He answered in the same spirit , \"We ll Julia, you ought to come to the rally. I am on a first name basis with partisans and st udents. Who knows, perhaps it'll be the start of a close fr iendship. So ca ll me Marc.\" How wise, how w rong, how right, was that statement. It was his inaugural rally a t Maryland. At McKeldin he used one of his f avorite parable s in his anti-war speech. He told of a mule trainer who trained mule s with kindness. A farmer came to the trainer to tr ain his favorite mule, a nd after one or two quick tries to get a harness on the mule, the trainer slugged the mule wi th a 2x4 right betwe en its eyes. The farmer was shocked. He ran up to the trainer and dema nded \"W hy'd ya hit 'em? I t wi th kindness.\" The trainer res ponded, \"I do. But I had to get his attention fir st.\" T he gove rnment was like that mule, Marc had a rgued. Marc not only had a mellifluous voice, but wi th his f lowing blond be ard, long hai r, and lea ther sandals he knew how much he l ooked and sounded the pa rt of the charismatic hippie leade r. The crowd wa s small, a s all had bee n since Nixon ende d the draft. Still, the day w as beautiful and a fter the rally c oeds, and a few of the rally's organizers gathered round to congratulate hi m for what they called a rousing talk. Marc wa s gratified to watch Julia there in pink short shor ts pus hing to the front . Whe n she got by his side s he breathlessly told him, \"That was inspirational. Y ou gave me so much to think about.\" FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 19Neighbo rhood Tremors They wal ked bac k to his off ice. Draw n to his handsome face, and his cha rismatic voic e, she wa s more certain than ev er that she wanted to be in the c ourse. He didn' t sit down when they got in the office. Nor did she. She looked a t his collection of books, most of which we re now shelved. He took a step to st and next to her. \"Ha ve you rea d all of these, Sir?\" \"Some more than once . But please, not 'sir.' \" Smiling a t her mist ake she turned aw ay from the books and toward him, and w as sur prised at how close he w as. \"No one in my famil y is much of a reader, sss ... I mean Marc. I think I love books. Marc, you already have me thinking about so much and school ha sn't even started.\" \"Now that you're c alling me Marc, we c ould start t hat friendship,\" he said, only ha lf teasing. \"Think I could also get into the course?\" \"I guess s o.\" \"Does that mean I'm in?\" He smiled in response. \"That's great! I'm in! Thank you, Sir - I m ean, Marc!\" she said excitedly . He moved slightly towa rd his des k, turned, and asked \" And wha t are you studying, Julia?\" he had said. \"I hope to be a business major,\" she s aid. So Julia nee ded a c ourse on politica l philosophy for her major. M arc wa s happy to interpret the entire interaction a s a suggested tr ade. \" Yup,\" he conclude d, \"you c an ge t used to us ing my na me, rather than sir , over the next months.\" And she did. For years. Even though w hen she'd give her invitations she'd thr ow in an occasional 'Sir,' as in \"So, Sir, woul dn't you like to remove my bra?\" or \"Will there be a nything else you might nee d, Sir?\" And so it began, eig ht semest ers of wonderful sex. Sex a fter class. Sex after anti-war rallie s. Sex in the office. Se x in her apa rtment. And then even a fter graduation on those rare occa sions when they were a ble to get togethe r. In his m ind, she was still lying there, still young, still bea utiful, st ill wa iting for him to caress her again, all w et with her sweat, on he r bed. He would trace her legs with one finger, moving up he r thigh, play ing with her thick pubic hair. The tickling g ave he r pleasure and some times, s uch as the time he now ima gined, she woul d hold his hand on her clitoris, s lowly w orking it back a nd fort h. And as these thoughts got him arous ed, he thought of the day he brought his camera and ha d taken pictures, and how before he took pic tures he r an his nails teasingly a cross her nipples. It was easy to arouse her again e ven after they ha d spent plenty of time enjoying their mating danc es. Her hairs ran thick with their juice s as he took her pictures . All this came back. And he thought of the one of those photos that was still on his wall upstairs. Of cours e, their relationship chang ed over time. But the photo never chang ed. Only rea lity did. There were brief periods where they stopped seeing ea ch other. They stopped for a short t ime whe n Elsa arrived, a nd when Marc a nd Elsa married, and a gain w hen Julia we d. But r eality intruded to end the relationship whe n, one particula r day he used Julia's phone to che ck his office's answering FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 20Neighbo rhood Tremors tape. That day there was a message from Elsa. And w hen he thought of Julia, he a lways came bac k to that day, that message. \"Whe re were you toda y?\" At the firs t sound of her voice, he remembered. He ha d miss ed Elsa's appointment with the doc tor. His immediate rea ction had be en annoy ance. He had promised to go with her, beca use she was worried, but just now she was a bother. E lsa had requested that he go beca use she had a premonition. But how could he know the weig ht of that s hadow? It had merely slipped his mind, and now there was her acc usatory voice on his office phone. Julia ha d called and sugge sted that they go to her place . Why should s uch a flimsy thread as a w orry tie him up? But t he subst ance overwhelme d the annoya nce. \" Where w ere you? Why di dn't you come w ith me? Call me .

J ulia - Elsa - Julia, his junior by more than 20 y ears. Elsa, who when she had di ed of canc er, had bee n his wife of 13 yea rs. How could he have k nown that Elsa's worries were warranted? Over these many yea rs, Marc's feelings of r emorse were relieve d by the sweet memories of that pleasure-f illed a fternoon and his s ouvenir photo. And then, soon, as Julia had a dvised on the phone, he fel l asleep. In the cha ir in fr ont of the TV. Without any a nswers t o the distur bing question of the day: w as the money gone ? FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 21CHAPTER 5: POSSIBILITIES Spring passed to s ummer and the threats fr om Wal l Street beca me known by all.

T he ye llow a nd white house that could have used a paint job in the spring, wa s revealing a he art of gray and brown, peeling and crying for care. Its gutter now dangle d free toward the rear. The deterioration of both the house, and its inhabitant ca ught the somewhat troubled eye of his neighbor. Banks were no longer unsinkable. The gov ernment no longer held ev il at bay . In September other financial g iants were falling . The large insurance c ompany A IG looked like a goner. The night AIG was on the news, Frances could hea r the prof essor screaming furiously at his T V. She e ven thought of dr opping in to console him. But just t hen Sarah c ut herself and Mot her Frances was off to help another injured soul. Most autumnal Sa turdays, Takoma Park children were off on one or another of Montgomery County's sport s teams; parents either chee red, coac hed, or did yard work. On just such a day, Frances was wee ding and pruning w hen her eye s came upon Profess or Buttervogel, sitting on his front steps . Unkempt, the da rk maroon coffee cup in his hand wa s askew. A small puddle of coffee lay on the walk benea th him. The prof essor was softly moaning. Instinctively , the social w orker moved to salve the pain. \" Good morning, Pr ofess or.\" \"Oh Frances.\" And then, a fter a pause, \"You doing OK?\" \"Sure, thanks. But you look a bit down in the mouth. Some thing wrong?\" \"I've bee n better,\" was the ea sy answer said with a forced smile. \"Want to talk about it? Sometimes talking ca n help.\" Marc took his time thinking about that. Absent to the moment, he wa sn't f ocused on anything remotely within the ne ighborhood of T ulip Ave nue. Slow ly, he g athered himself together and did his best t o respond in a friendly manner, \"Me? I've got some ser ious problems now. But you seem OK. Your kids keep growing. Your yard is looking nice . Amaz ing how y ou work, raise your kids, and still have time to have the prettiest garden on the bloc k. Frances sat on the s tep next to her neighbor. \"W ant to tell me a bout the problems? It's my profes sion you know.\" Marc looked at he r and believ ed he saw some ge nuine interest. \"I can't seem to get any thing done. I feel frozen by fea r. Jus t unable to move.\" \"Wha t is it t hat's got you so fearful and st uck?\" \"Oh, Frances. I don't know where to start. I t's so hard to explain. I'm desperate . . . maybe terrif ied. I may g o under. But t his isn't a job for a social w orker. Pr obably ne ver was. I need a banker. No, a sugar daddy. A R ockefell er.\" Marc gaine d a tight, fleeting smile. As it diss olved, he added \" I've lost everything. Just about everything.\" \"Oh, Marc - I am so s orry. B ut at least your pension and social security a re safe.\" \"Pension? I don't have a pension, Frances. I had an IRA but it's gone. R emember Bear Stearns? I had an a ccount there handl ed by a woman. W hen they w ent belly up, my ac count was transf erred. But it 's prett y much worthless now in any c ase.\" Possibilities \"Oh goodness! How did that happen?\" \"She c heated me .\" As Marc uttered the words he knew they w ere false. That this blatant distor tion was to be his public story s urpris ed him. As when he once simplified his points f or political rallies, he wonde red at the fragility of truth. What happe ns to it? Where doe s it go? How easily c orres pondence to facts on the table ca n be aba ndoned. As Marc wove in his fictions, his t one bec ame more ani mated, more empha tic. He w orked to suppr ess the reality he wa s holding captive . He shifted blame. \"S he invested eve rything in one kind of stock: ba nks, st uff like Citicorp, C ountrywide, Bank of America , Bear Stearns, AIG. She did the whole thing. Some advi sor! For a while I wa s doing great. Tripled my money. Things were going my wa y. I was about to retire my mortgage. Y ou know. E verything's chang ed. Now, I've l ost it all.\" The lies absolved him, let him retain his status, and gave hi m comfort. He continued, \"Here I am, 77, a philosopher. A philosopher with nothing to do. No one wants to hire a philosopher. I've been out of a cl ass room so long, I couldn't even tea ch at the c ommunity colleg e. I could lose my house next month if I can't pay my taxes or my mortgage. A nd then what's going to happe n to me? What if the next month I can't buy food and meds? This is a throw away society, Frances. And I'm lost, ready to be tossed. Not even Wa lmart would hire old philosophers.\" Marc grinned when he thought of that. \"Oh Marc! Let me give y ou a hug,\" Frances offer ed. Through the coverings of fall outerwear, they embrac ed. He w as expressing desperation, reaching out to her. And Frances wa s a social worker. Her kids were gone for the afternoon. So she did what she neede d to do. \"Let's brainst orm about this . Who know s, if we think this thr ough, we could think of something. You aren' t alone. Lots of people are in trouble. W e'll be getting a ne w President. Maybe he 'll help too. If we ca n just get som ething working for a whil e. Let me fix us some coffee. We c an sit and cha t. See w hat we c an come up with.\" And before he coul d even think a bout it, she got up, picked up her trowel, he aded for her back door to f ix some coffee and ge stured for him to f ollow. By the time the green wood-framed screen door had slammed twic e, Marc wa s inside her tidy kitchen a nd the kettle wa s on. Fr ances bus ied herself getting out cups, a coffee filter, sugar, spoons, milk and c offee. With the c ups out on t he kitche n table, the c offee brewing, a nd the unexpec ted suggestion of help, Marc relaxed a bit. All the c are and c oncern gav e him plea sure. A pe ace similar to that gained by a mothered infant spread over him. His facial muscle s visibly relaxed. France s Bussa was doing wha t she was best at: salving another person's wounds . She poured the coffee a nd sat down. \"Thanks, Frances. I needed this - a lot.\" \"That's what neighbors are for.\" \"Well, you, a nyhow.\" \"So let's figure out what to do, Marc. It can't be a s hard as s ome of those philosophical puzzle s you worked out. W here should we start? \" Thos e innoce nt words of his neighbor hit hard. Marc knew overcoming his financial losses wouldn't be a t all like solving philosophical problems. Solving this mess would be far more diff icult than ana lyzing the sort s of philos ophical problems he had play ed with. Philosophers in his fields FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 23Possibilities don't find solut ions: they write discursive paragraphs about how to look at problems. Nothing really needs to fit, to work. A politica l philosopher only needs a soup\u00e7on of originality a nd a social e ra that resonates with his bottom line. W hat wa s it Kahneman said? \"We have the illusion that we ca n predict the future because it is s o easy to expla in the past?\" T he philosopher needs what one' s friends label a s 'brilliance ' and 'rele vance .' With but a few friends one can slough off one's f oes who might point to 'narrow minded ana lytica l flaws.' But M arc wa sn't worr ied about the c riticism of philosophical oppone nts now: it was the potential pit of failure and pove rty that had grabbed his attention. No points would be giv en for bright ideas that didn't solve real problems now. Marc neede d something to work. Anyhow, w hat success did he ever have in philosophy? He hadn't eve n published. Marc's desperation was real, not philosophical. Its immediate manifestation wa s all about money. Putting the warm cup betwe en his palms slowly helped hi m displace these thoughts, agree w ith Frances and reach out for all the he lp he could g et. \"OK. Perhaps. We c an try. Maybe I ca n think my wa y out of this. I 've ev en got the help of my own profess ional socia l worker now,\" he added. They both smiled. Sipping the c offee, he continue d, \"You know , this was my second big financi al deba cle: y ou'd think I'd have le arned some. Seems like my stepfather was right when he said, I'm too st upid to be in finance .\" \"Why 'd he say such a c ruel thing?\" \"Who know s, maybe he w as prescient.\" \"Were your parents divorced?\" \"No, my dad w as killed in W orld War II. I can remembe r clearly how he left.\" \"That must be a pa inful memory. But I do wonder why y our s tepfather would say you c ouldn't do finance. \" Marc studied the grain in the wooden ta ble. Frances said nothing, know ing the silence could coax out more of his st ory. After a long pause, he continued, \"My stepfather was ca lled Jake . He was a stock broker. He had his own c ompany. He never like d us. T hey ha d another kid, Michae l. Michael be came his bus iness partner . Jake used to say, 'Thank God your brother has mor e sense.' My stepfather never could understand or f orgive me for being ang ry. When he died, his company was worth millions. I mean millions, but it was all put in some lega l hair-ball.

How did we e ven ge t to this subject, Frances?\" \"I asked you about w hy he said y ou wouldn't make it in finance. \" Surpris ed that she had opened such a g usher, s he wonde red nervously how to move on. Looking at he r bright yellow round kitchen cloc k, Frances was startled by the time. She ha d kids to pick up, things to tend to, and here w as Marc ready to open ye t another chapter. \"Oh Lord, it's already 5:30 . I was suppos ed to pick up the kids 15 minutes ago. W ell, this is a start . Let's both mull this over. Tomor row's Sunday; we c an continue this tom orrow. I'll call you. S orry, I've got to r un. Sit and finish your coffee. Then just let yourself out the back door. Be s ure to push t he button so it locks.

I'll take y ou up on the offer to chat tomorr ow - and I'll try to come up with some idea s tonight.\" \"Great, gotta run now,\" a nd Frances was gone in a flash. Marc picked up the c ups, coffee pot and filter and put them in the sink. Clea ning them wa s hardly more than a tiny gesture of gratitude. He thought of writing a small thank you note a nd leaving it on the table . As he turned on the water, he notic ed a nic e small silver platter in the sink. He ca refully put everything in the rac k, dried his hands, and picke d up the platter. He turned it over. Two words: \"Sterling\" \"Whiting. \" Very ornate ha ndles. Nice pie Not new . Fleetingly he thought of s lipping it under his shir t; here would be some ea sy money, possibly a month's expenses. But t he idea was absurd. He couldn't do that. Frances wa s all he had - hi s neighbor for more than 10 ye ars. What wa s he thinking? He sat down and wrote that simple thank you note with a sincerity that Frances would neve r know. Marc locked the door and cross ed the ya rd. FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 25CHAPTER 6: DINNERS With renew ed hope, Marc shuffled through the fallen lea ves, across t he drivewa y and into his yard. The faint cha nce of redemption ene rgized him sufficiently to gathe r up s ome of the unharvested newspapers that had ac cumulated ov er the past weeks. Throwing the old, faded, a nd wet ones in the big blue county recy cling box, he brought in a dry, and pe rhaps curr ent, Post to read over dinner. As alwa ys, the small TV was on inside the kitchen. Like the TV, dinner's locale w as invariant: the drop-leaf kitchen table with its one repainted spindle cha ir. Thes e day s the meal consisted of microwave d left over beans, a c ut up hot dog, and a pie ce of bread. Onc e all was ready on hi s plate, he unfolded the pa per and gla nced a t the front page headli nes. There was a violent uprising in Bolivia, more violenc e betwe en Hama s and Fatah, and a bailout of yet a nother company. A Senate aide w as being a ccused of bribery. Turning the paper over, below the fold: a feature regarding the mortgage crisis and the economic meltdown. Marc didn't ge t beyond the hea dlines. His mind returned to the conversation he had with Frances. W hy had he told Frances that Julia, the manag er of his invest ments, had chea ted him. Wa s he ashamed that he ha d made the de cisions? Julia Burnham, who had bee n his last great fling. Hadn't he told himself that stor y and reje cted it earlier? And how did he c ome to tell his neighbor about his step-f ather? Where had tha t come from? His beans were getting c old. He turned bac k to the paper and the a rticle on the ec onomic meltdown. But reading just the introductor y parag raph put him back in his memories. Wha t a mistake it had bee n to let Julia mana ge his finance s! How could he ha ve thought she would be his best bet? He had gone bac k to her, after Elsa died: to do wha t? To go to bed with her ag ain? That didn't happen. S he had move d on, was married. How c ould he hav e chosen her to handle his investments: s he wa sn't even smart enough to do well in that course. Why did he pick her as his advisor? Was it because he kne w that he c ould assert his avaricious goals without getting ridiculed? Marc breathed dee ply and tried to refocus on the here and now. But all he perceiv ed we re the echoe s of his step-f words . \"Incapa Laz y.\" A nd it was all true: Marc never eve n bala nced a chec king ac count. Whil e she was ali ve, E lsa paid the bill s. The extent of Marc's great financial gifts was earning some small salaries, and eve n that required the help of Elsa. She used her job at the Pentag on to secure the research grants that s ustained him and got him tenure - all without publica tions. Even then, he spent more than he e arned. Perpetually out of balance , his bank made the price of doing business t he cost of never-ending fees. He let it go, a nd picked a t his beans. Rega rding the kitchen tabl e he w as sitt ing at, he noticed a resemblance of it to his mother's table. She had that ratty old oil c loth on the table. His wa s painted. Many coats, all showing through the many chips of paints. B ut the shape: that wa s the same. The sudden recognition of the coincide nce le d him to open boxes he had long held shut in his mind. His f ork idly pushed the beans bac k and forth on the plate. His Mom's kitchen tabl e must have been le ft behind when they moved to Mulberry Str eet. Mulberry Street. Wha t a cha nge. That's where everything fell a part. And as he sat hundreds of m iles south, and thous ands of days away, a door in his mind opened, l ong lost details came ba ck into focus. Marc was transf ixed, reentering his eliving gradua tion, we celebrated our draft exemp t status: none of us were go ing to fight in Korea. Wh o was with me? We had some drinks at a b ar. Wh ere was that pla ce? It was da rk. I re memb er the long bar. I left. They stayed. It was a boistero us goo dbye. I walked hom e. At the front door o f that old building I fished for my key.

E merging partially from his mind, Marc slipped some beans into his mouth. T hen some bread as he reca lled the e nd of the saga. He remembe red grabbing some clothing from his s ister's bureau, and hi s own, and lea ving the a partment. He recalle d that Meliss a said she could w alk, a nd they we nt down the stairs to a neighbor. W ith Meliss a under his arm, they searched for a safe place to st ay. They asked if they coul d stay at the neig hbor. Meliss a started to bleed from br uises on her cheek, and the n her lip. The neighbors gave the tw o of them some bandage s, but not s helter. Marc asked for money to get a bus and they got to their grandmother's. She was shocked by how Meliss a looke d, and wa s surpris ed to see them at her door so late at night. She let them stay the night but ca lled her daug hter to tell her we we re there. The next morning Marc's mother picked the m up. They were ba ck at Mulberry Street. Mulberry Str eet. Melissa. Michael . Melissa, now dead. Micha el, a half-brother dis owned so long ag o. Marc sat there st illed by the shards of memory. All appe tites gone, he looke d at his plate. He rose, scraped the cold food left on his plate into the trash, and put his plate in the sink. ****** The next afternoon, Marc found hims elf continuing the c onversation with Frances. She sat facing the w indow so she could observe her children in the ya rd. Again, the re was coffee. \"Tell me once more, what happe ned? You have a financ ial advisor and you were telli ng me about her. You ha d said she didn't do things r ight for you.\" \"Right. Julia. She did rea l well for awhile. But she invested all my money in one kind of company - thos e big financ ial institutions. T hey looke .

He a dded, \"She 's guilty as hell. I bet she ruined lots of people.\" \"Let's hope not,\" answered Frances seriously. \"But I 'm glad to see y ou can smile a bout it. That's healthy. But what are you g oing to do? You are going to ne ed to make some money .\" But Marc wasn't responding. \"Marc, are you OK?\" \"Sorry, my mind wande red. I've got so many things I can't seem to do. You we re saying I'll need to make some money? Pr obably so. But I can't even figure out how I am going to pay for things.\" \"I guess t here are two sides to that problem. Your budget and your income . Your budget wil l have to ge t in line with rea lity,\" she said. \"Sta rt with income. If you can e arn some we'll ha ve less of a budget problem. So, tell me - what do you think y ou can do to ea rn money? We'll w rite down a list. Wha t can you do?\" \"I can write. But think of all the writers the newspapers are firing. I can't compete wi The philosopher plumber? I never met a phil osopher who could use a hamme r, much less a wrench. If they could, why would they be come philosophers? And I am certainly not the exce ption that proves that r ule. By the wa y, that is one of the more bizarre aphorisms . How ca n an exc eption prove a rule?\" \"I'm not going into a philosophica l swamp here. W e're looking for money,\" she doggedly ahea d. \"No practica l skills? \" \"Not that I, nor anyone I ever knew, noticed. But I was a pretty good teac her.\" \"Wha t can you te ach?\" \"Philosophy.\" \"Not much of a market for that, I'd think. Nothing else?\" \"Well, certainly not plumbing.\" Frances sipped her coffee and wa tched her kids out the window. A fter a pause she brightened up, \"Wa it, didn't you help me once w ith the kids' computer. Didn't you install some kind of software to protect it? And if you wrote a lot, you must know how to use a w ord process or.\" \"Sure. All the time.

Now, I have to ge t my kids to their f riend's hous e for a birthday party, but we w ill plan this out. Things will improve.\" And w ith this F rances picke d up her mug and the two raised their mugs for a s econd time w ith a sense that victory was at ha nd. Surpris ed by the progress made in such a short t ime, whe n the two stood, Marc quite spontaneously and gratefully e mbraced her in a hug before going out into the fall a fternoon. ****** That evening, France s was feeling like a pig in mud. W ith all her ene rgy focused on someone else's problems s he wa s like a prospector who had just found the mother lode. For years she had develope d this s ide of her being. By now i t was her str ongest suit. Dinner was the usual hodge-podge of left overs and mac aroni spiced with live ly chil d oriented banter. \"I spent the afternoon with our neighbor Profes sor Marc,\" wa s Frances' opener for sharing with the progeny. \"I don't like him,\" Sa rah remarked, ca refully tipping her gla ss so she could observe little rivule ts of milk flow onto the table. \"He's weird,\" a dded Christopher. \"Don't spill your milk,\" bega n the maternal rejoinde r.

I'd push her close to t he window , and togethe r we'd look out at the trees in the ya rd and wa tch the children on the street. At the window , Grandma told me lots of s tories of her life.

Since France s could only understand her son's disbelief as immaturity, she answered, \"E at up your dinner, boy. Some da y you w ill understand.\" And she got up to go to the sink. Without real purpos e, she poured herself s ome wa ter and sat back dow n. \"Let me tell you w hat happe ned with Profess or Marc.\" Christopher and Sarah Bus sa were often the audie nce for week end reruns of Super Mom Saves the World. But after the birt hday pa rty, at dinner, this Sunday, they e ncountered a ne w episode. They found that Mom had bee n working to save a ve ry local c orner of t he world: that old guy next door who turned out his lights and lock ed his door on Hallowee n. The plot was develope d rapidly: Poor P rofes sor Marc had lost almost all his money. He coul d lose his hous e! Christopher quickly calculated that this could lea d to a new a nd friendlier neighbor who would ope n the door and give him a bigg er stas h during trick or tr eat at the end of the month. But Mom was going down a different path; she was focused on saving the old man. \"Can I get some mor e mac aroni?\" came C hristopher's unexpected station break. \"Me too!\" as Sarah took a dvantag e of the pause in the programming. \"Sure. Be careful not to burn yours elf, Christopher! The pot is hot. Help Sarah! \" intoned Super Mom hers elf. And then, a fter a pause, \"Wha t should I do?\" \"For what?\" \"For M arc, I told you. Oh, by the w ay, C hristopher, I had to get a new cell phone yesterday.\" \"Cool, can I try it?\" \"I haven't ha d a cha nce to work it ye t.

F rances knew pl enty of elderly, and could e ven recommend him as a he lper. Marc, who might hav e had more of an impa ct on histor y as a sale sman than as a philosopher, thought of the moniker \"Dr. IT ,\" and the sloga n \"Dr. IT Makes IT Happen with House Ca lls!\" Frances told him that the big Kinko's just a mile down Ea st-West Highwa y, did nice w ork on busines s cards, and a marketing pla n was born on the phone. FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 33CHAPTER 7: MIRRORS AND MEMORIES Hearing France s's voice tha t afternoon, the poss ible felt pla usible. The plausible seemed probable. And the futur e was there for him to mold. But it was night now a nd the exuberanc e of the afternoon was disappearing. S itting in his underwear in his bedroom, Marc was reflected in the mirror hanging on the inside panel of his open closet door. T he bed side la mp left him in a dim, yellow ish twilight. As he hung up the phone, and wa s left alone seeing only his reflection, the bulb flickered a nd a cold shadow of Marc's des peration scampered a cross his eyes, replaci ng the fleeting moment of hope. Such hea vy shoulders and in the middle - a fac e with no smile, only the wrinkles of age, reflec ting the long etc hed frown of disappointment between che eks showing the stubble of sloth. How old he w as. How bent. How be aten. Hunc hed over, he saw his right s ock, the only one still left on his feet. Its most not eworthy feature wa s the hole around his big toe. Through that window e merged a toe be nt by arthritis , a na il yellowed by age and messily cut beca use of his deteriorating flexibility . Another old person's f oot on the left too. The paint around the mirr or was cracking , and ha d begun to pee l. Hanging up the phone had reki ndled his sense of abandonment. His mind drift ed through unsor ted earlie r desert ions. The chill of the October evening, ran from his gnarled, y ellow fee t to his crotch. This well w orn tr ajectory for Marc's shivers now brought him back to a nother cold day, some 30 yea rs earlier, conta ining a hi nt of pos sible infidelity. In the next moment he w as recollec ting Elsa's face. The face that ca me to mind wasn't the bea utiful, happy fac e he e mbraced when they first met. Nor was it the emacia ted hairless one she died with. El sa had hair, long a nd tantaliz ing, but her smile was replac ed by a jaw set in a nger and a lienation. It was s oon after Rea gan thrashed Ca rter. His friend Charlie, Profess or Domingo, had slipped him a copy of Gogol's s tories over what seemed a col legial coffee on ca mpus. Ever since, those stories threatened to amplify a ny wintry chil l. Gogol's portr ait of the old man le ft freezing whe n his coat is stolen. Gogol's sarcasm r egarding the man deserted by his nose. Especia lly that - The Nos e. Handing the pa perback to Marc, C harlie ha d laughe d about the comic immediac y of The Nos e. He had said \"R ead it. It's a chuckl e. And y ou won't belie ve all you ca n learn - al l you ca n imagine .\" But M arc found nothing comic in Gog ol. Wa s Charlie trying to wa rn him? Cha rlie was dating a guy who w orked in the Pentagon w ith Elsa. Marc had rea d those s tories in a fr igid January in Takoma Park in their Flower Avenue condo. El sa was coming home v ery late those day s and the two of them were going through a rough pa tch. Cold a nd desperation frequented those memories much as the smell of madelei nes did for P roust. After putting down The Nos e, he had w alked from his home along ic y streets to Sligo Cree k. Re cent floods had gene rated a pa th of fr ozen puddle s: choppy surfaces of ice. As he ca refully sought his f ooting, he wonde red what the nose symbolized. Of cours e, for any objec t to become a symbol it nee ds illumination to throw s hadows along the path of our mind's wande rings. T he irregular angl es of the walls of Marc's m ind insured the illuminations cast shadows at rakish angles. So it ca me that Gogol's nasal deta chment ca st jus t such apparitions for M arc. In the chill of that day , his crotch felt cold, and he ha d suddenly imagi ned his penis had bee n severed. How coul d the razor of the poor barber's dream become the scalpel for the removal of the philosopher's penis? The fear felt unreasonable but real a t the same time. That, of FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 34Mirrors and M emories course, only dela yed further worr ies. Wha t was Cha rlie trying to tell him that ea rly day in 1 981? Seeds for a nightmare were pla nted. See ds fer tilized by a lack of knowle dge, a dearth of information. Gogol's nos e appe ared in parties in high society, in appropriate attire. Marc envisioned his penis being pa raded around the Pentagon. There it was, erect in a full dress unifor m, highly de corated, saluted by the clerks and the col onels and being paraded into a conference room where C ap W einberger wa s pontif icating about the attraction of evil. He had ne ver been a ble to put these nightmares to r est. How cold. How alone. How powe rless and ignorant a nd how ignoranc e breeds sus picion. Now the aba ndonment he felt after Frances hung up the phone pulle d him out toward the cold again: returned him to the banks of that f rozen creek i n 1981. But Marc fought back to regain the here and now . And with e ffort he forced Gogol to return t o the shelf that held him. But though it took a terrible effort t aming Gogol di d not calm him. Instead he focused on his inade quate preparation for this new caree r, his s kimpy knowl edge of PCs. Elsa had force fed him tec hnology. W ith her job in the Pentagon, she had to le arn all a bout computers. At fir st, he had been totall y depe ndent upon Elsa. But before she died, she had pushed him to learn about word processing and eve n email. By now, his expertise, if we we re to call it that, stretched to the W indows XP fr ontier. And XP was alrea dy two ge nerations gone. He ha d to learn more. But Elsa was no longer here. There wasn't even a photo of her in the bedroom. T here wa s only that old, small photo of his father next to the mirr or. It was as if, because he kne w how to make a salad, he wa s being pushed to open a restaurant. How could he succeed? It was madness. Of course, he knew most problems were solved by rebooting. And he w ould be working w ith the elderly. May be tomorrow he'd go to Kinko's but first, he'd better go to the library and see i f there were one of those yellow and bla ck 'Dummies' books that could help him. Now howev er, he nee ded sleep. So muc h had happe ned; so much had bee n lost, any promise of a new start , any ne w roll of the dice should have been w elcome . But any feelings of relief were overwhelme d by foreboding. Marc realiz ed that he w ould have to do something. Whether any action by him really ha d a cha nce to right his ship was another question. He tur ned up the hea ter in the cold room, turned out the light, and tried to get to sleep. Sleep di d not come ea sily now that Elsa w as buzzing a bout agai n. Marc's mind was a wa lk-in closet of memories. Once in, he could l ose himself among the many items there. And now , he stumbled upon a memory of an early me eting of Elsa. She had bee n the frequent subject of humor and gossip over lunch and coffee a mong the depa rtment's faculty. She had come to Cornell to specializ e in logic and the philosophy of lang uage. Eve nts transpired to inter rupt her plans. F irst, Professor Smallw ood decla red she had absolutely no gi ft in logic. Ac cording to faculty ba nter she tion. As Smallwood's secretary put it, when he asked Elsa to mak e an a ppointment, \"Elsa c onsidered her clothing with ca re. She wore a white, la cy blouse wi th the top two buttons open, and a pplied a drop of perf ume betwe en her breasts . But even with all that preparation, Elsa c ould not successf ully persuade the professor .\" Then the Department lost its last great play er in the field of linguistic metaphy sics. Elsa refocused. Following the path of so many lesser talented souls who abandon the hig h peaks, she hoped to ascend the g entler slopes of ethics and political philosophy. A t Cornell, in the e arly 70' s this meant cross ing the threshold of M arc's many ca rtooned door. FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 35Mirrors and M emories Elsa often shared her memories of t hat deci sion, and how she planne d for t he meeting . On that day, i n need of a vi ctory, she was satisf ied with he r strategic a nalysis of the sit uation. She smiled when, a pproaching Marc's closed office door, she saw the ca ricatures of L yndon Johnson as t he devil inc arnate. Some one had told he r the path to Marc's good graces was political a greement. To mix her str ategie s, she had ta ken ca re to costume hers elf a bit like Jane Fonda. She knocked precisely in the c enter of the \"Peace NOW!\" bumper sticker affixed at a n angle below the na me 'Prof essor Butt ervogel.' He r life path was altered a s surely as if she were to have enlisted. ****** Tossing and turning, stewing about his sour ed marriage w ith Elsa, fretting about miss ed opportunities, and worrying about his curr ent financia l condition dema nded a hig h price from Professor Butt ervogel that nig ht. Dawn didn't promise better. He awok e to find his s heets balled up and damp w ith his night's demons , wrestling, and swea t. Putting on his clothing, the mirror repeated the v isions of defeat a nd despair. Br eakfa st did not ins pire. NPR bega n with unintellig ible mumbling about things in Europe and C hina. Marc's coffee helpe d morph thos e mumbls fr om noise to speech. Russians were cla iming interference by Georgia. C hina's free speech zone s were a ruse. Marc waited for news about the markets. Wha t would the millions of anonymous stock holders do this week? Would they restor e some equilibrium, or would they ke ep his safety net in tatters? The economy's spiraling into a bla ck hole g enerated a permanent sentence of pove rty for Marc. Would this sentence prove pa inful and slow or mercifully fast and lethal? Marc devel oped his fear of suf fering early in li fe. It was congea led in his earlie st memor ies. Why should the markets give him a reprise when his own family di dn't? B ut now, listen: The speaker is som e gove rnment spokesman. He is saying the markets are about to stabilize. No one should panic. The President is on top of this . Things can be expe cted to improve. But how can he trust Bus h? He turned off the r adio. He was left with Frances' plan to ke ep him afloa t in some minimal fashion. He would follow it; he would go to the library, a nd then to Kinko's. He could, inde ed he would, rebuild his future. After putt ing his dishes in the s ink, looking a t the clock (it wa s already past ten), and taking the ritual a fter br eakfa st stops t o take his morning medicine s, brus h his many- cappe d teeth, and do his morning habitual s, Marc left with new found determination, eve n if without any rea l optimism. It was a gentle dow nhill wa lk to the library. One of the blessings of his address on T ulip wa s that he could g o to the library without passing thr ough the corridor of low income housing. That neighborhood alw ays gav e him conc erns of being a ccosted, victimiz ed, terrorized. Under the multi- colored maple trees holding on to the last of t heir fall foliage , Mark st arted to revive. But a few steps more and the colored le aves we ren't enough to hold his attention. He like d the neighborhood library much more than the Uni versity's. M arc hadn't visited the University since retiring some nine yea rs earlier. His caree r had been humilia ting. Going bac k would only c all forth bad memories, especiall y of the many y ears after Elsa stopped working: yea rs during which he never got another grant. That record underscored that he had neve r published. It insured that he never aga in got a merit raise. It confirmed his profes sional identity a s enabled by nepotistic effort s of his wife: a woman he regularly a nd easily c heated on. Now it seemed that the markets merely were de aling out justice for those indiscretions and ea sy pleasures. The low slung brick library wa s a throwback to basic 1950 's cheap publ ic sector modern. The glass paneled a luminum doors with their wide push rods and their r edundant signs of gold lettering FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE 36Mirrors black backg round insis ting \"push\" opened e asily. Marc wa s in. The librarian was an attractive bleac hed blonde. He focused on the cut of her blouse: a thin blue fabric with d\u00e9 collet\u00e9 . The shape of her breasts reminded him of Julia. Pushing aside his financial ruminations he asked he r where he could find computer books. Without even trying to mee t his eyes that were still perusing the horizon of the plunging blue ne ck line , she told him, \"Look in adult non-fiction, or, if you prefer, use the computerized ca talogue. \" \"Could y ou show me how to do that?\" he responded. But s he didn't bite; the blouse w as bait for younger game. A nd so his convoluted thoughts led him to vow to ca ll Julia whe n he finished his tasks. He wa lked off alone towa rd the few computers that s at idle on the l ong wooden ta ble in the center of the big hal l. Whil e walking, he turned to look at the large room, with its many stacks of books. Mos t prof essor s, young or emeritus, would feel at home in this setting. But he neve r had enjoye d libraries. He didn't love books. Marc neve r just went into a li brary to savor a page in a n old favorite volume. He ne ver went to a shelf of a favorite author to see what he ha d miss ed. How he had chosen to be a 'scholar' didn't fit any of the narratives; no one would c all his life pla nning rational. He had ma jored in histor y to understand why his father had to die. But the answers of histor ians didn't satisf y, and he ended up tak ing a phil osophy course. Pr ofess or Black's cours e in ethics gave him tools to analyze injustices he had felt. The emergent struggles of the 60's demonstr ated others had suff ered injustice - perhaps eve n more than he had. Then V ietnam, a nd the draft, once ag ain brought to the fore the memories of his father, and pushed him into political activism. Marc ca me to see himself as a leade r for all those students who, like him, had suffered. He wa s mos t at home at the rallie s and in the cla ssroom. T his picture of hims elf as a tea cher and political leade r never included a place for hims elf as scholar; it wasn't part of his motivation. There was a sign saying \"A dult: Non Fiction.\" He didn't wa nt to us e the computer any how. A few stacks later, were the shelve s laden with computer books. And there we re the paperbac ks with the familiar bla ck and y ellow \" Dummies\" pattern. He was self scoring hims elf by passing up some of the other, fatter books that seemed to have less light-hearted fonts on their spines. I f he was to start this honest ly, he w ould have to admit his own level: Dummies it was. So many titles, where to start: \"The Internet for Dummies,\" \"Acc ess 97 for Window . \"W indows 98 for . eb for . .,\" \"W 2000 for Windows for . . .\". He reache d for t wo volumes and looke d for a comfort able pl ace to sit and read. The ca rtoons introducing the cha pters dis tracted him. Printed on a gray pa ge, they were ea sy to turn t o without wasting time in the tabl e of contents. Soon, howeve r, he was nodding off, as page after page of trivial information floated by hi m without any rea l hooks to s tore in his memor y. Fighting sleep, he stood up. He wa lked ba ck to the blue drape d blonde, a sked her for a penc il and some paper for som e notes. She ga ve him a c heap ba ll point and some scrap paper. R eturning to his s eat, he wrote a list: \"1) reboot; 2) rescue disk; 3) backup.\" Flipping through the pa ges, it didn't take long for him t o be ya wning a gain, a nd he wa s back on his feet. He drifted to the computers, the internet, and NYTimes.com Gone were the w ords of comfort from t he 'gove rnment s pokespersons .' Markets were down again. Wha t was he thinking w hen he ma de those investments? How could he have i magine d that Julia would steer him clea r of t he dang ers? But he couldn't do it by himself either. He didn't have a FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 37Mirrors and M emories good enough unde rstanding of numbers. He couldn't eve n bala nce his chec k book. Wa llowing i n self-deprecation, he sat immobilize d staring at the stock s ymbols and their prices. His mind moved from one thing to the next: the fea r engendered by the markets going down, the doubts r egarding his venture into computers , and the ne ed to get his financia l advisor to understand his f ears. He deci ded to chec k out two of the 'Dummy' books, and head to Kinko' s. The walk w ould go by Julia' s office and give him the opportunity to tell her how w orried he was. The thought of t elling he r his wor ries made him more optimist ic. \"She 's my advisor - and my friend. She'll listen. After that I'll go to Kinko's.\" He pick ed up the books, went to the che ckout desk, and left the library. A cold breez e had ki cked in, and the sun was obscured by a dull g ray mass of clouds. He immedia tely felt chil led. Z ipping up his jack et, he hea ded into the wind, a nd the falling le aves. Soon he w as in the center of the suburban downtown of Silver Spring. Wide sidewalks, surr ounded by fail ing Mom and Pop stor es. Multis toried buildings with offices of banks, accountants, lawye rs, some with small shops and franchise outlets on the ground floor s. The Everett Building had a marble exterior on the ground floor, aluminum vertical line s that went up to gla ssed in window s on cubicles above , and five inc h bronzed lettering on a bl ackened backg round on the marble: \" Julia Burnham Lamber t, Financial Advisor .\" Inside it was warmer. He felt sure that this visit would turn out well, even though he felt a bit ridiculous carrying the two \"For Dummies \" books. After all, Julia woul d be happy to see him. He took the ele vator up to the fourt h floor. Suite 406 had the same sign on the door as he had see n at the street level. Marc immediately noticed the ne w receptionist: a lithe , handsome man perhaps in his late thirties. He was dress ed in a fa shionably tailored g ray suit with navy pinstripes and a red and w hite tie on a na vy shirt. He could have stepped out of a fashion advertisement. \"How ca n we he lp you?\" he immedia tely queried a lthough to all a ppearanc es there were no others pr esent to pluralize the singular. \"My name is Marc, that's with a 'c ', Buttervogel. I am a clie nt of J ulia. I don't have an appointment, but I was in the neighborhood and c ame in to discuss s ome aspects of my financia l portf olio with her.\" \"Certainly. Let me just check i f Julia is fr ee,\" Namele ss responded. He then disappea red through a door. Some light hea rted mumbling leake d out to the reception area. A bit of laughter. A pause. The door opened and Na meless retur ned with a smile. \"Marc, wa s it? Wel l, Julia seems to have he r hands full and will be ha ving to step out for a lunche on conference a nd then to pick up her children. Perhaps it would be be tter to make an appoi ntment. Why don't y ou call us when you are at your cal endar?\" Marc was too embarrass ed to expla in that he didn't nee d a ca lendar. As he le ft he knew he had to pee , but couldn't bring himself to ask if he could use the bathroom. Leaving the Everett building, he wa lked the ha lf block north, went into the McDonald's and ente red the men's room. In f ront of the urinal he rea ched for his fly, and found it hadn't been c losed. So they we re laughing at him: the burnt out old man and his open fly. He pe ed. FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 38CHAPTER 8: TURNING POINTS Marc zipped up his fly, and thought a bout the morning. He didn't have the fortit ude to go on to Kinko's. The whole project dissolved under the weig ht of the ridicule he suffered. Leaving the men's room, he entered the overly bright, artificial ly che ery ca thedral of American fa st food. He blankly focused on the kid's menu with its picture of t he Rona ld McDonald clow n. He chose a table, but wi thout any purchase he kne w he'd be there only a mome nt. His undoing at Julia's office took the starch out of his res olution. The walk home seemed far longer and c older than the one that ha d brought him downtown. Walking down Tulip towa rd his hom e he stopped to watch France s' children playi ng in their yard. Startled by a honk , he found that he had stopped in her drivewa y, and w as blocking he r entry. How long must he have sat at McDonald' s? The day ha d just s wirled by. \"Wha t's up P rofes sor?\" came France s' greeting through the open window of the va n. \"Oh, you don't look so well. Is s omething wrong?\" \"I don't think I can go through with this bus iness idea. I went to the library, but I couldn't get myself to Kinko's.\" \"There's alway s tomor row! Come ove r after the kids go to bed - s ay 9 o' clock?\" And so it wa s left. The few hours t hat hung in the ba lance left his mind to wander through the failures of the past. They pushed out any positive possibilities of the present. He was sitting in a cha ir at his kitchen table, w ithout a light on whe n he wa s roused fr om his darkened reveries by Frances' ca ll. Minutes later he wa s facing her through the Bus as' screen door. \"Wha t turned you so gloomy agai n? You can't go on li ke this. Did you have dinner?\" poured out as she opened the door and he wa lked in. He r maternal conce rn touched a sensitive spot; the questions led him to r ealize he hadn't ea ten. He wa s hungry. In r esponse, she made him a bologna sandwich w ith a big slice of tomato and lots of mayonna ise. \"And how a bout some tea?\" she s uggested, al ready tak ing out a tea pot and teaba g. \"Sure.\" They were quie t as she made the tea in a pot and poured two cups. Then she sat down and watche d him eat. \"Now whe re were we ?\" she queried as he ate. \"Y ou can do this, Marc. It can't be the ha rdest thing you've ever done.\" She sipped her tea a nd ended a few seconds of s ilence with, \"By the wa y, wha t was the hardest thing you eve r did?\" T he question was out of her play book, one she often us ed whe n clients were despairing. The question was a stunner. M arc stopped chewi ng and stared at her. He resisted going down this r oad. \"Thinking a bout that brings out a lot of pain, France s.\" \"Well, perhaps it would help to unburden some of it so we can separate the mountains fr om the mole hills.\" A rather long minute stood silently as he thought about openi ng up to his neighbor. - 39Turning Poin ts I told you my st ep-father was nasty,\" he be gan. \" It was the sum mer after my high school graduation. One da y, whe n I got home, he wa s beating my sister and mother. I stopped him. Whe n he left the apa rtment, I tried to get them to leave the home. I couldn't convinc e my Mom. B ut I did get my sis ter out of t here, at le ast for the night. That was the hardest thing I've done.\" \"Whe re'd you stay?\" \"My grandmother's place, but only a night.\" Mark pic ked up his tea cup a nd stared at its interior. \"She didn't wa nt us s taying more than tha t night. She ca lled Mom and told her we w ere there. The next morning Mom picked us up, and we w ere right back in the battle. It actual ly wa s worse 'cause my step-father didn't feel I had any right to intervene. That translated to no longer having a right to be at home. It was some s ort of turning point.\" When Mark pic ked up his tea cup he was staring at its interior . His hand trembled and he ha d to hold the cup wi th both hands to pr event from making a me ss. \"Why do you say a turning point, Marc? \" \"Well, it wa s for both my sis ter and my mother. My mother never seemed herself again. S he could neve r look me str aight in the e ye after that. M aybe she felt guilty. I alwa ys felt sor ry for her , but neither I nor my sist er ever asked her to lea ve ag ain. It was sad.\" \"And wha t about your sis ter? Why was it a turning point for her? \" \"Melissa? I think it was that morning, when w e were sent back home that she started eating le ss: much less. She ended up a norexic. I must have told you that.\" \"Maybe, but I only remember that she died. You must have suffered greatly. It's s uch a da rk, terrible st ory. I didn't realize. S orry.\" Marc sat for a time in silenc e. Then Frances added, \" What happened to y our Mom ?\" \"She staye d with Jake. W hen I was in graduate school, in Chic ago, she die d from a concussion. My step-f ather cal led and said she got it in a fall. Melissa and I were sure she was pushed or hit by him. But what could we prove? T he only one who might have witnessed it was my brother, Michael. He wa s thir teen. That wa s way ba ck in 1958 . Melissa, who was the smartest of us kids was pulled out of her firs t year of colle ge. Jake demande d that she help out at home. She was told she could go bac k to school as soon as Jake could a rrange things,. But t hat neve r happened. I told her she should leave home, but she felt she had to help out wi th Michael. W hen Melissa died, here in Maryland, I wa s so furious I wasn't even going to tell Michael about her death. I just hated everything Jake had done to the family - including a dding that little kid.\" \"I'm so s orry for all that y ou have ha d to go through, Marc.\" \"Yeah, we ll I don't think it did a lot of good to talk about all this, but t hanks for lis tening. That sort of answers your question though, doesn't it? \" \"Wha t was the question?\" \"The hardest thing.\" \"Oh, right, taking y our s ister t o your grandparents.\" \"Grandmother. I never knew my grandfa ther and don't either of my or Gr andmother that was still a hell of a ni ght. You we re really strong - a hero that night. To your s ister. And then to be sent back. My God. Wha t a painful memory. But what strength! That memory can g ive you de termination. It s hows what sort of person you are. It would be worth remembering that taking he r out of your home that night wa s a hell of a lot harder than getting to Kinko's and following up on any le ads I can give you. W ant me to nuke the tea hot agai n? It certainly isn't st eaming .\" She w atched the tremble in Marc's hand spill some of t he tea on the table a s he reached the c up over to her. They sat without talking a s Marc slowly sipped his tea. Then they chatted a bout this and that. When he left, Marc felt more optimis tic. He w ent home, tuned the radio from its dr one of news to a classical music st ation and sat bac k. For the fir st time that day , he felt that just poss ibly he ha d hit bottom: he could make a new life for hims elf. Whe n he we nt to bed, it was with a li ghter heart. And whe n he aw oke, the optimism had bee n amplified by a restful s leep. ******** Kinko's suggested a little red logo of a la p top in the upper left corner, under \"Dr. I T.\" They gave it a couple of nice fonts, and followed his name by 'PhD' without noting that it was in philosophy. On another line, in a smaller font, the card advertised that he did expe rt PC-tune ups, lap top repairs, and made house calls. The last two lines gave his email address and phone number. All this had bee n suggested by the cle rk at Kinko's. The cost was $10 for 100, and pi cking it up w as the only a ctivity of his 'grand opening.' Now he wa s 'open for bus iness.' Psychologica lly, the a ctual ope ning ca me when he could tell France s that he had the ca rds. With Frances honesty was his policy, but it had ex acted a toll. So it was a few days before he could respond to her daily questions and tell her that yes, he had the business cards. \"Let me bring some over for you,\" Marc suggested. A few minutes later, he wa s at her kitchen table onc e more, another wa rm cup of tea in his hands, and some screaming children in the backg round. Tea done, he ha d Frances' promis e that she would refer people to him if they ne eded computer help. For the firs t time in quite a w hile, he felt like reciproca ting a friend's hug. A kiss on the chee k and he w as out the door. Hallow een found Marc with marshmallows, ca ndy and his lights on. Sarah a nd Christopher weren't interested in trick or tr eating a t their moody neighbor's door and went off with fr iends in the opposite direction. But when, at the end of the cold ni ght of spooking, they broke awa y from their pack of friends, the two goblins finally knoc ked on Marc's door. \"Boo, - tr ick or treat\" they shouted together. Sarah' s face wa s showing be hind a mak e shift mask that was beginning to tear. It had been part of a specia l costume Super-Mom had made . \"Who do w e have here? The ghost s of Halloween pa st? I hope not!\" responded Marc. He was surprised that s eeing Frances' kids brought a lump to his throat. It meant more to him than he could hav e supposed. Why ha dn't he done Ha llowee n the previous years? T he pain of not havi ng children of his own came back sharply. A nd so, for a moment he stood there not moving, a bit stunned. They shout ed 'trick or treat' a few more times before he hande d them the big bowl of treats and said in a very de ep voice : \"Take a s many as you ghosts need, and then you be tter take a few more. Your Mom needs some too. We wouldn't wa nt her to s tarve, would w e?\" They laughe d and shouted Happy Ha llowee n as they ran ac ross the driveway a nd disappeared inside their back door. FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 41CHAPTER 9: THE CHARTER HOUSE Just days after Marc delivered his cards, and Frances had gi ven Marc his hug, Margery Whitma n called her Uncle Charles for help. In spite of her s tellar record in aiding Vera Table au, and the ensuing support ive le tter that Fr ances had written for her file, Margery had be en unable to secure employment. In this endeavor, ev en Uncle Charles had been ha mpered by The Whitma n Foundation's declining e ndowment during this 'great recession.' With its newly a cquired dismal fortunes, the board, or more pr ecisely , Grandmother Mart ha, ha d imposed a hiring freeze. Thus, when a gain Margery ha d appea red at the threshold, loveable , poor and wee py Uncle Charles could offer not hing more than an unpa id internship. And so, M argery had g one bac k to her saintly former boss, hat in hand. Economic downturns leave public employe rs with somewhat different trajectories than their private sector siblings. B eing e xperience d in these things, Fr ances knew that the County 's ever- growing, monstrous budget deficit w ould soon res ult in a hiring freeze . So when a bonafide social worker knocked on he r door, even one of evidently modest quality, Frances acte d with unusual alacrity. After all, a ny live body would he lp her age ncy ge t through the coming freeze. A nd thus, even in the se tight times, our ange l, Frances gaine d yet anothe r heroic hand to help the c ounty's unfort unate a nd disabled. Margery started right away . That the Whitman family avoide d embarrassm ent only ca me about by the a lignment of the stars and the signs of the zodiac. These forces vaulted Margery a s a newly minted profess ional. Those same randomizing pow ers led some of M arc's business cards to be place d into the very profess ional, and chic , blac k briefcase of Margery Whitman. Even be fore s he we nt out to do the r ounds of her new c lients, Margery needed the proper accessor ies. At the top of the necessity list had been a set of new w heels. The ones she received would hav e bee n more appropriate as a realtor's st arter vehicle , but they we re hers. T he ca r had been the famil y's gift to her. M artha announc ed it with her typica l tight lips, \"You know, my dea r, your father would have wanted y ou to have a BMW, even if these tight times mean that we c ould only ge t you the smallest BM W.\" C haracteristically , Martha overlooked the non W hitman half of Margery's parentage. He r parents had died in a la te night automobile c rash a few yea rs back. Martha had alw ays blame d Margery's parents' ill-cons idered choic e of a che ap, and perhaps flims y, Japanese import, for t heir premature eternal incl ine, a nd so the gift of the stylish B MW had a proper redemptive, a nd schoolmarmish character. Even, or perhaps, especially , when she wa s completely a lone, slipping into the Nav y blue le ather seat of the new metal lic sky blue Bee mer was sensuous . In her mind, Margery had alrea dy spent her first pay che ck on ey e liner, a mini-dress and boots to go with the coupe's interior colors. T he pleasant conta ct with the dea d animal 's skin on her thighs felt like a c aress. Margery's fir st appointment was in Silver Spring, on Fenwic k Street: a R uth Dedrick. She opened he r blackberry and c hecke d the notes on Dedrick. Dedrick: somewhat disoriented. W idow. 87. Two minor str okes. WW II camp sur vivor. Hearing problems. Suspicious of non- Jews. Moderate paranoia. C heck me ds, well-being, environment, mental status. Charter House, 1316 Fenwic k, SS, pt 1210. (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 42The Charter House She ca lled, spoke to an a nswering machine , and le ft word f or Mr s. Dedrick. She would be there within the hour. Margery then punched the address into her vehicl e's information s ystem. The comforting baritone male voic e took over as her companion a nd guide, le ading he r effor tlessly to her high rise destination. Fenwick w as an anoma lous s hort s treet, a miniature urban ca nyon, designed i n the 1960s by haplessly displace d New Y ork architects. Near the Cha rter Hous e, the street level shops included a shoe repair st ore, a paw nshop, an army surplus store, a c leane r, two banks, and a c onvenienc e store. These had entrances both to condos above, a nd to private underground parking below . She put her leathe r clad, ba ritone directed, baby beame r in the paid subterr anean lot. Swinging her legs out of the car, her feet, high hee ls first, hit t he ground. Her shoes were the precise color of the car. Margery imag ined herself in a shoe commercia l. As she approached the building she reca lled the mixe d messages about Charter House: that it had a splendid pa st but that things had slipped a bit. But upon entering the lobby for the firs t time, she was impress ed with the fancy tile d floor and the large marble a nd wood front desk in the chandelie red lobby. She looke d around for t he human she presumed went with that front desk. But no concie rge appea red. While leani ng aga inst the s omewha t dust y, and now that it had her attention, somewha t grimy marble top, an e lderly woma n came up to her. The woman looked a bit like a New Y ork bag lady, unkempt, wea ring a house robe and faded y ellow te rry cloth slippers over grungy white socks. \"Ya sure are too fancy to have y er mother here, ain't ya ? Ya ain' t waitin' fer the mana ger, are ya ? No one eve r gets r ound to this des k no more. No one to help. If yer lookin' for som eone y a can't use the phones neither. They don't work. Jus t go up the elev ator, sweetie.\" The w oman then shuff led out to the str eet. Margery found eleva tors off to t he left, and took one to the 12 floor. Odor s in the eleva torth seemed to be anc ient references to various human waste products mixed with potent chemica l cleaners. T hey put miles betwe en her current environment and the vehi cle tha t had transpor ted her to the Charter house. The ride seemed inordinately slow, a nd the creaky noises led Margery to reflect upon her poor parents' f ate and its link to the inevitable de terioration of mechanica l objects. When the door opened she was confronted with a long c orridor . In sharp contr ast to the lobby it was dark and da mp. Holes in the vinyl tile flooring could easily c ause one's heel to c atch. The hall's odors were related to those in the eleva tor, minus the clea ning ag ents. Margery was out of her eleme nt. The door to 1210, like all the others: a chipped dirty crea m with a da rk red color beneath. It was fitted with a small knocke r-bell combination. Using it led to no a udible bel l and only a soft knock. She could he ar some classical music inside and so she banged l oudly. After wha t she took to be far too long, she heard a w oman's voice w ith a thick a ccent that marked an ea rlier era of immigration. With al l the \"w's\" disguised as \"v's\" and the \" th's\" as \"d's\" M argery hea rd a greeting, \"For vat is dis?\" Formulaic bac k and forth eventually had the desired effect and Mrs. Dedrick opened the door. \"You know , furs t you should call . De n I vod be vaiting a nd could more nice ly let y ou in, ja?\" Overwhelmed by the heat, a nd the stench, it took Margery a moment to understand and then decode the foreign sounds into comprehensible linguistic signals of somewhat standardized E nglish. The smells indicated that garbag e was the main industr y in the Dedrick household. A nd even though it wasn't more than cool outside, the thermostat in the apartment, if there was one, must have be en set to 85. Mrs . Dedrick's greeting falsely claimed (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 43The Charter House arrival. Of these three assaults on her, Margery could only de fend aga inst the last one: \"I did call, you know. But you didn't pick up, so I left a message on your answe ring machine .\" \"Vat?\" led to both a repetition of the st atement, a bit louder, and a more pe rmanent imprint of the anomal ous temperature and smell. As in all of histor y, eve ntually, thing s moved on. \"Vell, an a nswering machine I don't have. But I vas here and no one ca lled.\" Margery took in the small studio apartment. It was all quite nea t. But when her eyes settled on a veritable he rd of miniature fr ee-range roac hes that were quite a t home scurr ying a round the kitchen counter, she experienc ed a de ep-rooted shudder . She saw the te lephone /a nswering machine combination blink ing nea r the bed. \"Isn't t hat a tele phone answering ma chine, ne xt to the bed?\" Margery queried with a raised voice. \"No one told me da t.\" \"You didn't he ar the telephone ring?\" \"Dey say I don't hear vell, I vud like to, for then I could hear opera be tter. And Beethoven. My granddaughte r too. She lives in San Die go and c alls me on Skype , but I can't hear. And v at is your name?\" \"Whitma n. Margery Whitman.

Perhaps we c ould get you a hearing a id. I am just checking to see if everything is alright.\" \"Vat is, 'all is right'? Dis place is neve r right, never good now. Va t, you have a cold?

Maybe de r is someone to make de computer's sound louder, s o I could hear my kinde la in San Dieg o? Sophie is s o young.\" They sat facing one a nother in the two old stuf fed arm chairs, one dirty maroon, the other faded navy. \"I will put all this in my report.\" \"Vat report ?\" \"I will tell the c ounty that the plac e stinks of garbage .\" \"And den de y vill ta ke my pla 44The Charter House \"No. The county wil l bring inspectors to look at the building.

And Ruth coul d not get across the possible conseque nce that ma nagement would single he r out as a tr ouble make r. So the stand off just happened. It wasn't resolved. \"Coffee, Mrs. Vitman?\" \"No thank you, Mrs. Dedrick. Do you have enough medic ines?\" s he asked a gain. Marge ry was already impatient with R uth Dedrick. \"In my computer, I have no sound. Are you sure you vud have no coffee?\" \"Oh yes, I just had coffee a bit ag o. Thank you very muc h. And how a re you fixed for medicine for your blood pr essur e?\" \"Fixed for vat?\" Mr s. Dedrick was up, getting two c offees. \"Medicine . I really don't wa nt coffee.\" But Ruth had al ready turned on her ele ctric percolator. \"Vell, medici ne is alva ys too expensive. I can't buy medicine and pay for my apartment. Cream and sugar or black?\" She a sked, after pouring the coffee. \"Why don't we look a t what you ha ve, and I will write it down.\" \"Crea m?\" \"Can I look at what you ha ve in medic ines?\" Ruth handed he r the cup of coffee. \"But I don't have. S o vat to look for? \" Margery put down the cup on the side ta ble by the chair. \"Do you know w hat the doctor wanted y ou to take?\" \"My doctor? Vat about my doctor?\" \"Wha t did your doctor pr escribe?\" \"Medicine .\" And so it went. Eve ntually, w ith her coffee getting col d on the small side table, by the maroon chair she had be en sitting on, Margery decide d to look for hers elf. As she got up, Ruth asked whe re she was going. W ithout answering, she entered the bath room and opene d the medicine cabine t. Sure enough, there she found the Lasix bottle with about 15 pill s left. T he date i ndicate d it had bee n bought more than a ye ar ago. C onfront ing Mrs . Dedrick led to a clear and thought out answer. \"Vat do I have to live for? No one is left for me. My granddaughter I can't eve n talk vit in Sa n Diego. V y should I have medic ine if I can't eve n hear my Sophie ? Can't ve ha ve some one ge t my computer louder?\" So Margery left Marc B uttervogel's card with Mrs . Dedrick, a nd escaped to the lobby hoping to mak e tracks toward the underground vault whe re her metallic sky blue baby la y. The old bag la dy wa s still in the lobby standing c lose to the eleva tors. FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) \"Ya done so soon? Couldn't ya have more time for yer friend ya w as visitin'? I guess ya ain't like that,\" she warmed up as she bega n to walk w ith Margery across t he vast lobby. \"Y ou ain't got generosity, do ya ? Ya probably don't e ven ca re she can't live fancy li ke you.\" Margery picked up he r pace, trying to ditch the w oman. But it wasn't to be. \"So ya don't like visitin here do ya ? Maybe ya w asn't visitin. Not r eally. So wha t ya doin he re no how; sellin something?\" Margery, now quite de sperate, was nea ring the exit. But the woman tagg ed right along. Marge ry hurried her s teps for the front door and Fenwic k Street. Margery's st ylish heels clic ked on the tile floor. The woman increa sed her shr ill accusations. \"I bet ya wa s just doin' business , weren't ya ? You ain't got no friends here. You're just too good for us, ain't you?\" Once Margery le ft the building, she was relieve d to note the old woman hove red inside, still muttering her insult s and sus picions. Before entering her car, Margery took out a lemon scented disinfectant towlette from her black lea ther briefcase. After letting the used tiss ue float to the parking ga rage floor she spr ayed a little lil ac scent be hind her ears. Sitting on her leathe r throne with her baritone, she real ized tha t continuing to do this fr ustrating work in the environments of r oache s, stenches, and c onfused elderly clie nts forever would not be suitable. She ne eded to eng ineer an e xit. She settled bac k for a moment to r egain her calm. It ca me when in he r mind s he pictured her baby beame r holding her in its loving embrace. After the moment of r elaxation, Margery opene d her Blackberry, and looke d at her schedule. Next was Ve ra Tableau, a couple of miles to the Ea st: the very person who enabled he r career to be launche d. She programmed her GPS and entered he r notes on Ruth Dedrick. Tur ning on the ignition, the ba ritone told her precisely how to proceed. In a different tone, a few floors above, Ruth Dedrick, at that very same moment, w as yelling into the telephone to the consternation of a PhD named Butt ervogel w ho promis ed to make house c alls. She wa s to become his fir st cus tomer. FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 46CHAPTER BUSINESS MODELS Only whe n Marc anticipa ted defending his PhD, more than 40 yea rs earlier, ha d he bee n as nervous as he now was, antic ipating the w ork he was to do for Ruth Dedrick. The call from one's first customer would have led ma ny other start ing entrepreneurs to f eel more secure. But not so Marc. Ra ther, Dedrick's call reminded Marc of al l his worries . How could he poss ibly pull off this new c areer? How could it lea d to any long te rm savings? What nonsense were the promises that Frances had held out for him? At 77? This morning, the very day he planne d to make his firs t house call, he had woke n up with a toothache. The recurrence of the pa in caused a ll these fears to s urface ag ain. E verything had be en thrown into disarr ay by his loss of savings. He couldn't cove r emergencie s. His cur rent lot was to live on, a nd never bey ond, his social security income. Now : a toothache , just when Marc could not afford to go to a dentist . How could he take c are of himself when the consequenc es of his financia l deterioration robbed him of the means to do s o? This led to a la undry list of naggi ng doubts: Could he pa y his mortgage and a dentist? Was there a free dental clinic nearby? Wha t was he to do about the plumber bill from last month? He had al ready put off paying tha t bill. Now, whe n could he pa y it? When coul d he pay his car insurance? How about the roof s hingles that had c ome down? And the gutter? On the 17 of the month he would receiv e his social security chec k. It had to last a month. Heth tried to figure out if that was possible. An old shopping list was lying on the kitche n table. He turned it over. He wrote and rewrote his budget. Say he went to the dentist. That would cost 75 dollars if nothing were nee ded. A filling ? Add a hundred. Wha t if it were a root cana l? What then? A thousand? T his morning he had mea nt to check the ba lance s in his checking and savi ngs accounts. But ins tead, he was distracted. Money problems filled his mind. Two months ago he had a broken fa ucet. The plumber had come a nd charged $ 220 to fix it. Now instead of a wa ter problem, he had a mone y problem. He kept cross ing out plumber and dentist which le d the budget he w as writing to look something like this: Marc focused for a minute on his utility bills. He went to look at his thermost at. Set to 64. Turning down the heat w asn't doing it, he nee ded to figure out how to pay his bills and ha ve some thing to save for emergencie s. He got up, poured a small bow l of cereal, and boile d some water for coff ee. A fter putt ing it down on the tabl e, he sat, in his paja mas in the kitchen. The gray lig ht of the overcast winter morning wasn't s upplemented. Scribbling the numbers brought back memories of wrest ling with E lsa's expenses. Thos e were horrible days in expensive nursing homes. She wa s dying, and a ll his mind couldn't get bey ond his worries of financia l ruin. While she withered aw ay, he watche d the spending of tens of t housands ofDecem ber incom e: 2036 Social secur 450 Heat, w ater, ele ctric 220 Plumber 175 Dentist 85 medicine s 75 telep hone 185 car insuranc e 200 food 40 gas / bus ------ 2835 expenses ---------------------------------- -799 shortf all denti roof?Honeymoons and Bu siness M odels dollars each month for what passed as 'cures' and then 'ca res' in inst itutions t hat gav e neither.

That day they ha d come from termites . Extermination a nd carpentry repairs had run above twel ve thousand dollars. He couldn't pa y the bills. Staring him in the fac e had be en the pharmacy bills for September and Oc tober. September hadn't bee n paid, a nd so it was included in the October bill. It was a total that he still reca lled: $6 324. For pills. He had de spaired. Wha t was he to do? What wa s he to s ell? He had c alled Blue Cross . They put him on hold for an eternity. Finally someone ide ntified himself. \"Wha t am I to do about these bills f or my wife's medicines?\" \"You c an ask the pha rmacy for advice .\" \"Isn't any of it covered?\" \"Not once she left the hospital.\" \"But s he wa s dismissed to the nursing home.\" \"Her insurance cove rs treatment in the hospital. If you have a dditional insurance for the medicine s in the nurs ing home you should conta ct that company .\" \"But I don't.\" \"We're sor ry. There is not hing we can do to hel p you with uncov ered expe nses. You should have thought a bout that when you w ere choosing your insurance options.\" Surely he ha d hoped to remain empa thic and supportive while she la y dying , absorbing all their assets . But how could he? The long and ex cruciatingl y slow arc of Elsa's illness led him to despair. Its shadow darkene d his curr ent insecurity. Of cours e, from the advantag e of these yea rs, he would ha ve preferred that he had shown affection, rather than ang er. Not that it was all his fault. Elsa ha d a temper and pa ssions that introduced some serious ly bad time s after s he we nt to work for the Pentagon. His mind settled on one in ea rly 1981. They w ere living i n a small apa rtment on F lower Ave nue in Takoma Park. ******** She had g otten up quietly. She had grabbe d her glasses and book and come i nto the living room in the middle of the night. \"Elsa, w hat's wrong?\" he asked as he wa ndered into the living room. \"Oh, has Jesus finally c ome to ask why his parishioners are unhappy?\" Her sardonic tone hurt him. When he w ore only his briefs , Elsa often ca lled him Jesus. She said Marc's blond beard and long hair marked him as an a cademic. But in his underpants , she claime d he could be modeling for a cla ssic pai nting of Jesus . It had been mid-winter: he w as pale a s a ghost. \"You mea n, why did I ge t up and come in he re?\" s he continued, \"Why do you think? I can't sleep.\" \"Is something wrong? I mean, it's after two in the morning. You have to work tomor row.\" FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER siness M odels \"Wrong? Is that a question, or just s ome dela yed observation you'v e recently made? Are you so dumb that you don't know the answe r to that quest ion?\" \"Wha w ant me to start? \" \"There's a list? Why di dn't you talk a bout it before we went to bed? Come on let's go to bed. W e can chat a bout whateve r this is in the morning.\" \"Forget about the morning. It's now, and I ca n't sleep. I'm too angry. About eve rything.\" Making a move of subm ission, he ha d sat down on the sofa where Elsa w as sitt ing. El sa immediatel y stood up to r egain her adva ntage a nd moved a few feet awa y. \"I'm not angry, I'm fur ious, Marc. Don't you have a clue? Like, ev eryone ge ts a honeymoon! E ven fucking R eagan is getting a hone ymoon. Cronkite ha s been talking a bout it all week. A nd you ask me why I'm piss ed? I s upport you with God-damned grants; I work every da y in an e normous bureaucrac y just so you can look good a t the University, pretending to be a productive scholar. And all the while , you are e yeing the tits of every c oed that wa lks into your office. And me, I get nothing.\" Marc had blushed briefly but, give n the dim light at the sofa, it remained hi s secret. \"Is it me ... us? Or is it Reag an that's got you so piss ed?\" \"The whole thing. Of cours e, I can't be lieve I am going to have to work for Cap Weinberger.\" \"But you've known R eagan wa s going to win for a long time. C arter was toast s ince A pril, with that crash of the copters in the desert . Eve ryone knew . And you kne w since the inauguration that y our work group at the Pentagon would ha ve shit poured all over it, that he'd probably discontinue your office. It hurts me too. I'll lose my grants and then what of my tenure at the university?\" \"Poor fella. You a nd all y our young coeds who ha te war. Do you tel l them that it's your wife's job to feed you Pentag on money for that sham? Wel l, now your honey feed is drying up. Maybe if you'd be en more of a scholar you would ha ve had a research record for tenure.\" She had hi m there - squeezing his balls. She w as the sour ce of his deadbe at money, hi s grants. Maryland loved that grant money . He wa s coasting for life, bec ause she had set him up with projects on Jus t War Theory. He didn't nee d to do anything - just spr ead the mone y around the Philosophy Department. Maryland got its share and other prof essor s could hire assistants. T hat's the syst em she was support ing. He ha d counted on these grants to land him tenure. Tenure without publications. But he tr ied to cha nge the subject. \" Why a re you on me like this? Wei nberger and R eagan aren't eve rything. Wha t about us? \" \"Right, they're just som e of the detritus f rom Carter's collapse - they are the a nnoyanc es. I have pl enty of problems without them. I am marr ied to you, Marc. Y ou are about a s exciting as FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 49Honeymoons and Bu siness M odels a brick to come home to. What a m I? You treat me like yesterday's garbag e. I only exi st to feed you grants. Rea gan ge ts his honeymoon, but me? No way .\" These iss ues were buzz ing like mosquitoes around her brain that night. The job. The marriage. \"But Elsa, we ha d that trip to T urkey before we g ot married, and you said . . .\" \"Forget our honeymoon, you don't eve n remember our anniversary. How many time s have you forgotten it? It's easier to count the number of times you remembered. For Chris t sake, once? And you a sk me what's wrong? I 'm married and wha t do I have from it? Nothing. Not even a suppor tive husband. And in a few hours I 'm off to wor k to get you more grants. What's wrong with that picture? Where's the profess or who explored moral issues? Where's your ambition? What ha s happened to my life? To my week end. Burnt t o a crisp. That's what.\" Skipping ove r the pers onal a ttacks, Marc asked, \"Are y ou just angry that you're married to me?\" \"Married? I s that what I am? T o call this 'marr iage' unfortunate is t oo kind. You ma rried me beca use I was pregnant. And you w ere so embarrass ed you only permitted one member of your family to come to the c eremony: your sister, M elissa.\" \"Whoa , that's a crock, a nd you know it.\" \"And then, y ou went right back to work. When I had my miscarriage you said y ou never wanted a child a nyhow. May be you ne ver wanted to ge t married. Maybe you only wanted to stop your lif e from falling apa rt after you couldn't get tenure at Cornell . Maybe y ou just wanted me to suppor t your lifestyle by fighting for your fucking grants. Every month that's pass ed has meant more nights out here. And now, I ca n't sleep; I'm too worr ied, too overwrought.\" Marc never understood why these thoughts were dashing through her head that night. \"You're totally distor ting what's betwe en us and you know it. Who wa s I suppos ed to invite from m y family? Whi ch one of my dea d parents? Tell me! Come on! Who? My father or my mother? Or was I s upposed to invite that son of a bitch st ep father, or maybe my half-brother, who hates me? Tell me. And I had to go ba ck to teac h, you know tha t.\" He remembered the pa use. A moment of quiet. And he ha d gotten up to put his arms around her. Elsa bac ked off. \"Stay a way from m e. Don't touch me! Y ou just want to hold on to that river of m oney I get you. I'm s leeping out here.\" She stared at him as he stood there, and then, he a dded in a c alm voic e, \"May be we can ta lk about all this tomorr ow night.\" E lsa, put her glasses back on, picke d up her novel, The Tin Drum. Rejec ted, and c hilly, ruminating on some of Elsa's ac curate compla ints, he put down his arms to go back to the bedroom. But s he didn't let the a rgument go. \"I'll tell you w ho has it right - Os kar. He ha d the courage to throw himself down the stairs and beat his drum. M aybe that's what I should have done. W hy the hell did I ever dress up like Jane Fonda? T o show you my cle avage? To end up sucking your dick? For what? T o be a professor ? Well, that didn't ha ppen, did it?\" \"And now w hat?\" she continued. \"God, wha t's going to be left with my budget? They're going to bury eve rything that grew from that Fr ank C hurch committee. Ethic s, bull shit. M ove over ethics, give us some room for evil! Grass at least gave Oskar a drum. He could get a ngry.\" FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - M odels As Marc retr eated i nto the bedroom he thought about the new situation. W hat had he been thinking? The ethics of non- violenc e? Non-violent war? A pacifici st in the defense department? How could he be lieve that the path he w as on, that she was suppor ting, wa s stable? \"Give me a drum,\" began he r last s creed, \"the n I'll tell you who i s guilty: the authors - all of em - frauds. We don't get drums in life! Who's my author? Who knows what's in the hea rt of an author? That kid Os kar had it right - never grow up. Grow up and you ha ve to go into the army. You ta ught me wrong: the world is evil. R eal pe ople like me ca n't throw thems elves downstairs. T hat's what Grass got wr ong. The world gets Pope John Paul and we R eagan - nothing but a dumb ac tor. What a difference .\" Elsa wa sn't calming down. S he put down the book a nd poured herself a large hal f glass of scotch. It was like pushing in the clutch in the car: Let the engi ne idle. Let the brain addle. For a minute she hoped to focus on those few questions she knew she had to focus on: her job; her marriage. But the alcohol was str ong, and a round thr ee Elsa snuck back to bed. Marc had pretended to sleep whe n she got there. Breakfa st was overcast by the memory of the night before. It had left a bad taste in his mouth - as if he had e aten rotten food. During his dr ive to ca mpus, he thought about his profes sional status , and how i t had been supported by Elsa's philosophy project. Getting money from t he devil had seemed to require no compromise. After the Americans we re taken hostage in Iran, he had le d rallies aga inst r acism when Irania n students were targete d on campus. But how much longe r would he be a ble to pursue his anti-bellicose leade rship on the tab of the warriors ? Obvious ly, such an a genda had suited both Elsa and himself, but as a project in the Defense Department - it was out of character. It had been forced on the de partment by the Church committee. Perhaps the bill for his Faustian contract was coming due . Apparently Elsa understood t his too. The next evening Elsa returned much later than normal. He r comportm ent was greatly altered. Marc remarked tha t she looked positively radia nt. No longer agita ted, she opened up to relate her day . She ha d gotten an ide a - the seeds of which she had ac tually ripene d during their fight. At firs t it had been obscured by the scotch a nd the ange r. Her career, their income, required a stratagem. During her wait on the pla tform for a metro s he tried to recall it. A t first she could only pull up l ast night's dis gust at her 1969 dress -up like Fonda. But t hen she suddenly remembered that conj ecture of hers that the world was evil. She pondered this in the cold. That was the seed to germinate. When the train arrived she found her luck good: she ha d a window seat. Wa tching the world whi zz by gave her time to fr ee associate about her new Weltanschauung. \"Look, Marc. If I could win a PhD with the clea vage of Jane Fonda, why not a chang e of costume to win a profess ion? T oday I drafted a proposal to change the focus for the DARPA Philosophy Pr oject. I'm going to propose a project on the philosophy a nd nature of Evil. W hat do you think!\" \"Evil ? Isn't that changing sides?\" As s he hung up her coa t, he noticed tha t most of the buttons on her blouse were undone, a nd she smelled of scotch. \"Not necessarily. It depends on what I say about it. I already start ed. W ant to hear?\" \"Are there going to be grants for me to study evil?\" FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 51Honeymoons and M odels \"Apply and you shall see . I don't s ee why not.\" \"Let me hea Opportunities r egarding the Nature Philosophical Understanding of Evil. . .. ... Ce rtainly, in such terribly dange rous times, when our own citize ns are sent to defend the great va lues of Fr eedom, Family , and Fortune, we must increase our understanding of the motives of our enemie s: the attraction of evil. .. .' \" \"The words jus t flowed this mor ning, Marc. I think you should pour me som e wine to celebrate.\" \"You sure? You seem to already ha ve had a few.\" \"Well, it wa s a good day a nd Steve volunte ered to take me out for drinks.\" \"Steve? Who' s he? Some new guy? You look pretty ple ased with yourself? Did you tr y to seduce him give n our argument last night?\" She paused a nd noticed that Marc wa s looking at her blouse. She reddene d. \"Marc . . .\" \"A little tit for tat?\" \"That's crude. I was telling you a bout something we both should be happy a bout, let's not start over aga in. It was a big da y for me. If t hey a ccept these ideas, maybe you have to change your focus. B ut you could still get tenure. Y ou couldn't ask for funding for 'A Paci fist Defense of the Democratic State' anymore. But that was ending a nyhow. Y ou can reformulate that to 'A Strong Democratic State C onfront ing Evi l.' That isn't s uch a big shift . I'm not s elling my soul, or your concerns. I'm jus t baiting the hook.\" Elsa smiled for the fir st time that eve ning. She di dn't button her blous e. She obv iously had made some good moves at work today . Marc, her marriage, that w as another deal. She seemed to have a plan to dea l with at le ast one of the problems t hat had a ttacked he r last night. Hopefully, it woul d lead to both of them getting a better sleep tonight. \"How wi ll Patricia tak e to this? \" Patricia w as her assis tant in the next cubic le. Patricia had put violet colored la ce on one of her walls to sur round s ome of her family pictures. She had taken the da y off, for some family matter, Elsa reported. Elsa a lso wondered how Patricia w ould absorb this chang e in the goa ls of t heir miss ion. Would she obje ct? Never mind, it was Elsa's call. The real question was not Patricia but how the secretary, W einberger, a nd whomeve r would be a ppointed by him, w ould respond. \"Come on Marc, you said I was looking positively radiant and I've a lready g iven you a head start with my blouse. I feel like I just might have save d a philosopher with that refocus. I need a reward.\" Marc couldn't get out of his mind that the reward seemed to have a lready be en recei ved from s omeone el se. He imagi ned the whole interchange . Elsa woul d go in the la dies' room to look at herself in the bathroom mirr or. Alone in the room, she would hav e buttoned, and then again unbuttoned, that top button. She would hav e brushed out s ome of the kinks in her long FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 52Honeymoons and Bu siness M odels hair. She w ould have smiled that she had let it grow long a gain. S he would ha ve tossed her head and wa tched the ha ir res ettle on her shoulders s uggestively , and felt a c ertain satisfaction with the way the day ha d unfolded. She might ha ve pla yed w ith undoing more than the top buttons of her blouse. Smiling at he r planned seduction. But M arc couldn't resist the temptation and the pheromones. He was quite cl ose and he noticed how she w atched hi s attention shif t toward her clea vage. She smiled and di dn't button her blouse. And so it was that Marc RSVP'd her invitation. First tur ning from ethics to evil, peace to war, a nd now perhaps something more. She felt his hardening penis as he felt her hardening nipple s. Elsa's s mile had c hange d. Her radiance took an edge , and they had wa lked together to the bedroom. But after that day, E lsa's progr am had c ontinued to suppor t him. It had its down side. It led to his long time fixation with Gogol's 'The Nos e.' It required an ima ginative rethinking of her office at the Pentagon, a nd a shift in his own public personna. Happily the co-eds of the Reag an era w ere just as pleased with his new conservatism as their cohorts of the 70's had been for his liberalism. He had prospered under her guidance. So of course, he should have bee n more grateful. And whe n she was ill, w hy couldn't he have be en more of a support . But he knew that wa s spilled milk. He couldn't cha nge wha t happened, and now, y ears later, he wa s again una ble to make ends meet. ******** Marc had give n Frances his cards weeks ago. Sinc e then he ha d receive d all of one c all. Two days ago? How c ould this lead to more than chump cha nge. A nyhow, w eren't computers a young man's job? How could he mak e enough mone y to get him over the hump? He had seen hundreds of thous ands of dollars evaporate: all his s avings. All the monies that the University had put into his retirement accounts. For what? T o make a house call; to look a t some computer? How could he know wha t to do? Why w ould anyone trust him? What could he c harge? Fifty dollars f or a house call? And then what? Get two a month? Maybe, three? That wouldn't pay the plumbe r, or t he dentist. And if he broke a hi p or s omething, and ne eded rea l care? Wha t then? How could these house calls fix his problems? This wouldn't get ba ck his lost s avings. An oc casional house c all wouldn't help him support hims elf. In another black mome nt Marc realized he could ea rn mor e as a steady greeter at Sam's Cl ub. From a highly focused frenzy, his mind slipped into a dull de press ive memory bank. Focusing numbly a t his old, worn, blue paja mas he saw a loose thread, a nd picked a t it, pulled it. A w hite button (one of the few still remaining) lost its hold and slipped down to his lap, then the floor. He watche d it roll out of s ight under a cold radi ator. These ratty old pajamas: his mind slipped back to their origins. It was a cold morning in Col lege Park. Julia urged him to stay in bed rather than wa nder out into the cold of the room. Suddenly, she had reache d over with one a rm to t he side of the bed and tossed a brown paper bag into the air. She had pa inted a big heart with lipstick on the bag . She hel d him close with the other arm and the bag c ame dow n squarely on his head. Inside were these flanne l paja mas. They had la ughed togethe r when she announc ed that he c ouldn't put them on until she got another orgasm. And so he r eached over, pulled he r on top of him, and missed his of fice hours and the students who we re planning to complain a bout the last exam. It was just a few wee ks before Elsa left her urgent mess age requesting communication: \" The doctor s ays I need ca ncer screening, immedi ately.\" And whe n summer came, and Julia w ent to London, he brought the pajama s home, putting them in his closet. Elsa had a lready g iven up her job. The che mo was just too devastating. She FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 53Honeymoons and Bu siness M odels started out tough, as though she was never going to give up life. E very other wee k he would drive her to the clinic in Ga ithersbur g: part of a new me dical complex tha t was growing in that ex urb. These were dark drives. Not only did he hav e little to say, but his resentments were building up. He could foresee that he w ould no longer have either the luxurious time or t he spare cash that his dallia nce de manded w hen Julia woul d return in the fall. If he only had more money, he could hav e hired help to get E lsa to and from the clinic, to do the domestic ca re-taking. But given his lack of publica tions, the grants that got him tenure didn't yield rai ses. P entagon phil osophers didn't get top pay. Money was alw ays tight. Now without El sa's s alary, they would be strapped. As the week s, and then months pass ed, things got darker. His carefree wa ys were replac ed by a somber r hythm: cooking, driving, and liv ing on a far more limited inc ome. By the time Julia ca me back from London, she felt tot ally out of s ync w ith Marc's newly imposed, darker time. There were still a few lovel y afternoons in her bed, and eve n some exciting memories of passion in his office, but the relationship was doomed. That winter, after the affair was over, when E lsa was too distr acted w ith her own heal th to notice the a ddition to his wardrobe, Marc had begun to we ar the paja mas - some twenty yea rs ago. Now only two buttons remained. And one sleeve ha d a serious hole at the elbow. And how did his planned house c alls fit into all this? Getting up from his chair and pa ltry breakfast, Marc realized tha t he neede d a different business model. One in w hich he c ould charge for f ar more than the house call. And for mor e than the work he would pe rform. Something like that was required if he were to ga in suff icient inc ome. Perhaps if t he clie nt was too ignorant to see what wa s wrong with the computer, he could pull a fast one. Over the sink, he fleshed out some poss ibilities in his mind, and estimated the inc rease in revenues. If he only got more call s. For the firs t time he felt that he might be a ble to regain some semblance of his old life-style. And in this chang ed mood, he w ent to take a shower and meet the day. FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 54CHAPTER 11: left his r usting Cava lier unlocke d at a broken mete r on Fenwick Street. He look ed up. It threatened a cold rain. W alking from t here to his client in the C harter House, he passed an old army surplus s tore. Marc st opped to look at its window full of Christmas decorations. On the left was a rather ornate painted, woode n manger. It had gilde d ange ls hovering nume rous intricately painted ba rnyard animals surr ounded a sea ted Mary with baby Jesus in her arms. M ary wa s wearing an indigo dress. A golden ha lo hovered abov e her hea d. Near it wa s a carefully la id out table setting for a fest ive C hristmas dinner. In between the two w as propped a big sign \"Today's Spec ials.\" Beneath the sign were the more usual a rmy sur plus items: a combat knife, two pistols and an ammo clip. Marc noted that the ba rrel of one of t he pistols was a bluish s teel that we nt nicely with the color of Mary's dr ess. A few more steps and he entered the C harter House. Marc was one more newcome r impres sed by the grea t lobby. For him, the lobby's marble and wood ooz ed money. It br ought to the fore his dreams of f inanci al achieve ment as well a s the reality of his failures. He noticed the few peopl e who were milling about, but he faile d to observe their f orlorn and vaca nt countenanc es. He observed none of the clues showing the dec imated financ ial condition of his environment. His s elf-deception c ontinued in the ele vator. Ra ther than acc urately dec oding the fetid smells of decay, they brought positive olfactory memories to mind. Couple d with the ac cent he ha d heard on the telephone , the smells unlocked heretofore lost s ensory impres sions of a happy a partment life that existed before his father left f or war, before his s tep-father arrived. He pictured his mother and grandmother after s chool, preparing me als for his sister, father and himself. The dark hall going to Dedrick's apartment only reenforced the ple asant rush of sensor y memories of thos e early times. No longer holding real image s, he imagine d going to the door, ringing the buzz er and seeing his mother open it with a smile. As she had al ways done, before the bad times rolled in. Although Marc's mother had come from Russ ia with her parents at the time of the Revolution, she had be en raised in a tightly kni t community on the lowe r east s ide, whe re everyone, when forced to, spoke English with a Russian or German acce nt made for vaudevill e. So Marc was almost ready to be disarmed by the smells and the a ccents that met him once the door opened. Almost beca use these very unusual moments of inner peac e were unexpec tedly a nd immediatel y interrupted by the high volume of Mr s. Dedrick's greeting. Suddenly he wa s back in Silver Spring, on Fenwic k Street, in the Cha rter Hous e. And this nasty transpor t from his r everies came via the same a ngry voice that had upset him a few da ys earlier on the telephone . Its shrill tone inverted his mood and metamorphosized him from s chool chil d to churlish, newly minted, America n business man. Using his plumber as a model, Marc had dec ided to cha rge a flat show up rate of $75 for a house call, plus time and expe nses. So he was in no rush as Ruth Dedrick c omplained a t length that she couldn't hea r her lovely Sophie when using her laptop. Marc a sked her to s how him how she booted up. He wa tched her as she put in her passwor d: AUC H145, and w rote it s urreptitious ly in the little spiral notebook he ha d place d in his shir t pocket. After all, he also might have to boot up the machine . Whe n the Window s fanfare came on, he asked, \"Is the music loud enough, Mrs . Dedrick?\" FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 55House Calls \"Vat? Vat did you say?\" she responded to the vague sounds s he hea rd. Increasing his volume a notch a t a time, they e ventually communica ted. She ha d no idea tha t there was a fanfare w hen the la ptop began. Marc be gan by chec king the volume . It was at a max - nothing louder could be c ranked out of the tiny speakers in the machine . She obviously ne eded external speak ers or a hea dphone. These were ve ry inexpensive solutions to a very simple problem and henc e of little pecuni ary interest to him. Now that he was begi nning his profes sional developme nt he had to admit depe ndency on house calls to the elderly for any of the 'joi e de vie ' that money might buy. So Marc fished for more than additional audio ge ar for t he laptop. To gai n the gravitas to justify a larger bill, Marc thought it best to begin with some questions. \"Whe re do you use the computer, Mrs . Dedrick?\" Marc shouted. \"Right der on de table, but vy should I us e it ven I ca n't even he ar my Sophie, my yenga la?\" This didn't ring true. Marc had seen a few i cons on the desktop, one for M ozilla Firefox, another for Works , and still another for Quicken. \"Don't you e ver use it for other things bes ides the telephone ?\" \"Of course I do,\" \"Marc Butter vogel.\" \"Vas dat But tervogel? A funny name. Are your parents German den?\" \"Buttervogel it is. B utter-bir d. No, both my parents were Jewish; my mother was from Russ ia and my father's family ca me a bit ea rlier fr om a part of Germany nea r the Polis h border. B oth of their families came i n the yea rs after the firs t world war. They grew up toge ther on the lower east side.\" \"Jewish! Not German den. Gut. And a Doc tor too!\" \"Yes. I was a prof essor but I have retired.\" \"Dat is vonderful. If my son, only . . . but, don't you va nt coffee, Dr. But tervogel?\" \"No thank you, Mrs. Dedrick.\" \"Are you take no coffee?\" \"Well, actually pe rhaps. Sure. Thanks. T hat would be lovely . But don't make it for m e if it is any trouble.\" \"Trouble? Vy vod it be trouble? M y son, God bless him. He vas in Vietnam. Lost. Gone. Und my vonderful man too, in de Korea vor. Herbert. He vas handsome. So who do I have c offee for now if not you? \" And she turned toward her percolator, and started clea ning it. \"Well thank you, Mrs. Dedrick.\" \"Ruth. Plea se, Ruth,\" she insisted as s he opene d a fresh can of coffee. \"Und something to ea t, no?\" \"No, MER ) PAGE Calls \"OK. Sure, why not.. You are pe rsuasive. Don't you e ver use your computer for other things besides the telephone?\" he a sked aga in. Marc was alrea dy noting with some guilty satisfaction that time was passing while the meter was running. But he was also feeling quite c omfort able i n this throw-back to childhood situation. \"In my computer, I have no sound.\" \"Yes, I can see that will ne ed to be repaired.. But don't you . . .\" Marc stopped as he watched Ruth Dedrick go to the sink to get wa ter for coffee. W hile she turned, he we nt to the touchpad and double cli cked on Quic ken. Up poppe d the window de manding a quicken pa ssword. He typed 'AUC H145' a nd opened up a file containi ng financia l information. Mrs. Dedrick wa s getting the two coffees and he c losed down Quicke n. \"Crea m und sugar or black?\" \"Don't you eve r use it for other t hings besides the telephone,\" he queried ag ain, but now tha t he had ac cess, he didn't really ne ed to hear her answer. \"Crea m?\" \"Sure. Thanks.\" She brought the coffee, a nd some sm all cookies on a little tray, a nd sat down. \"Of course,\" she began, \"I keep a ll my records on the computer. Only dis vay ca n I remember ver tings are, and v at I have. I even pay my bills on de computer. You know I may be old, but I lea rn. It is de tventieth century now y ou know.\" \"Well, the twentie th century was almost a dec ade a go. These are very nic e cookie s.\" \"Oh ya! I made dem. I know. I am a good bake r. But now I have noone to bake for. But of course, it is t venty von now . Did you lose family i n de vors? \" \"Well, my father wa s killed in the Sec ond World Wa r. I hardly remember him. This is good coffee, thank y ou.\" \"I have no von le ft but my granddaughter Sophie. Many died in de c amp. My husband in de Army in the next vor.\" R uth was staring out the window now, lost in some reverie. Then she asked almost as an after thought, \"Can y ou fix de sound for me?\" \"Sure, but I may have to take the la ptop apart to put in an ada pter. Can y ou spare it for a day or two?\" \"I could for a day. C an I have i t on Tur sday?\" \"I'll certainly try.\" \"And den v at vud dat cost?\" The question uns ettled Marc. His mind had drifted awa y from the business side of the relationship. He was ea ger to explore the information on her computer, before actua lly setting up a pricing schedule a nd bill. \"I can't be sure. I charge for the visit, the time, and the pa rts,\" he responded, \"a nd I can't be sure wha t is needed until I open the mac hine. C ertainly le ss than a ne w laptop of this quality! I will need to test the sound s ystem in your computer to s ee what ca n be done to help y ou. Perhaps we are looking a t $150-$350.\" FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 57House Calls \"OK den. Do it. And I dank y ou so much for de trouble, Doctor. Ve Jews know a ll vor is terrible, no?\" They chatted on a bit, and then he smiled, pl acing a card in her hand, and like a trust ed son stealing his mother's m oney for a drug deal , he ca refully put her laptop in a c arry bag, a nd left. The corridor t o the elev ators s eemed l onger on the exit than it ha d been on the e ntering. Wa iting for the eleva tor, he could feel his hea rt pounding. Alone, i nside the eleva tor he leaned a gainst the side wall , light hea ded and somewha t dizzy. The profes sor realize d that his career was taking a drastic turn: not one likely to be a ppreciated by his social worker sponsor and neig hbor. Compared to the great hurdles he had to ove rcome to establish himself as a philosopher, t his career seemed to be his for the taking. The door opened, and he e xited. But his dizziness was s uch that he ha d to sit down. He looked around and saw a n old couch there in a corner of the lobby by the front door . He wa lked ove r, sat down for a moment to regain his balanc e. Depe nding upon whic h way he turned, his view wa s of either the str eet or the interior of t he lobby. He turned to look inside; the lobby wa s mos tly deserted. Outs ide, the w eather had c leared up. Indee d, it looked to be a beautiful day . He took a deep brea th. There was a scruff y old la dy ca rrying a bag, and we aring terry cloth slippers, gr ayish socks and an old blue house robe. She was coming in from the str eet. The old lady notic ed him and a fter entering, took a seat on the couch ne xt to him. She turned to face him. \"Ya waitin' fer a cab? No cab ever gets round to this place no more unless you call. No one to help. Y a new here? I'm Gladys. What's yer name, swe etie?\" The thought that he might be thought of as a resident of Charter House was sufficiently frightening to motivate Marc to ris e. \"No, I was just s itting down for a moment to catch my brea th, good day Gla dys.\" And with this, carrying his bag, the philosopher exited to Fenwick, walk ed to his car, and drove home. Moments later, sit ting in his own kitchen, he opened the c arry bag wi th Ruth Dedrick's laptop. He plug ged it in a nd logged i n as Ruth Dedrick. Typing A UCH145 led him to think that it could be de rivative of something significant. Re calling Ruth's tale tha t many of her relatives had died in the c amps, he Googled \" Auschwitz libe ration.\" There it was: January 25, 19 45. Here it wa s, almost 64 yea rs later and for Marc, it was a number that could c ommemorate more than freedom from a Nazi dea th camp. It also could commemorate his freedom from t he financi al fate tha t had befalle n him. The thought of this secondary significanc e brought a shadow of a smile to his lips. With luck , he opene d Quicken a nd then it took just a quick flick or two of the cursor to uncover all of Derrick's detailed fina ncial information. And luck hel d. The same password opened enable d Quicken to a ccess her online ac counts. Ther e it wa s: an acc ount at Chev y Cha se Bank with an astounding $31,412. 17 in it. And a n investment account a t Fidelity with more than $230 ,000. His fingers tr embled. He stood up t o give himself some time to consider his s ituation. A minute more and he found that both ac counts were fully operationa l elec tronically. A t this point , he had done nothing wrong. He ha d stolen nothing. His head wa s lost in the poss ibilities of the moment, Marc walke d out the side door onto t he driveway he shared with Frances. He beg an to rethink his busines s model so as t o take a dvantag e of his new understandings of t he facts. Cle arly, Frances' notion of IT work for t he elde rly could be tweak ed into something far more lucrative. He be gan spinning out dreams regarding his regaine d lifestyle, his escape from penury. FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 58House Calls And suddenly, there w as Frances pulling in with her miniva n. He could see one kid in the front seat. He felt guilty e ven though he ha d only contempla ted, or more accurately , begun to pla n, a life divergent from the one Frances had designed. Fee lings of guilt led him to act to deflec t any appea rance that c ould lea d to sus picions. Out came a n over-quick, \"Hi C hristopher, how come you're home from school early?\" Exce pt for the speed, it sounded perfect: no hint of coverup. But he wa s too eager. The engine hadn't eve n been turned off and Frances was still clearly ta lking to her child. Then Fr ances left the van with her own quick greeting: \"How 're you doing, Marc? Bus iness start yet? I gotta get Sarah to bed: they called me to pick he r up cause she has a fever. We 'll catch up later.\" Was his confusion of t he children a hint that something was amiss? Would she think about it and be on to him? He worried, so he didn't let it rest. \"Sorr y to hear that, Sa rah. Ca n I help you Frances? Get s omething from the list ening; she wa s pus hing her way forward, naturally herding the ne edy membe r of her br ood to the safety of a sick bed. The unexpecte d feelings of guilt, brought on by the unexpe cted proximity of Frances, distur bed Marc. To calm himself he took a wa lk along the banks of Sligo Cree k. Along the trail, he wa s afraid that his demeanor would g ive him a way. To whom, for what would have been rationa l questions. B ut irr ationali ty reigned. He avoide d both mouthing and responding to the neighborly greetings that were to be uttered whe never another adul t passed by. Momentary thought of being lost in a Gogol stor y went through his head, but most of the time Marc was lost in developing his plans and the guil t that was oozing from them. He would purcha se speakers, and perhaps a hea dphone too. And a t this point , he wouldn' t overcharge. He first would milk the PC for all it was worth: take off her infor mation - copy the files. That would allow hi m to regain a de gree of the economic security that he had lost. He could then use Dedrick's assets slowly, with luc k, imperceptibly . Why raise the old lady 's suspicions at this time, rather than take a dvantag e, in the future, graduall y and safely ? Having worked out a pl an, the weight of the guilt and risk fell off his back. He now walk ed bac k briskly, almost gaily, smiling a nd saying good da y to almost everyone. The retur n to the Charter House on Thur sday should have be en uneve ntful. Marc had the laptop in his carry bag. He wa s also carrying a shopping bag from Ra dio Shac k. But the s trange old lady w ho had sat down beside him w as aga in in the lobby, on the same sofa as when he ha d left her. She appe ared as if she had neve r moved. Indeed, she was still with a shopping bag , and we aring the dirty yellow terry cloth slippers , grayish socks and old blue house robe. Whe n he entered the lobby she jumped up, and w alked over to him. She tried to block his easy pa ssage to the eleva tors. \"Ya remember me, Swe etie? I'm Gladys. Ya know , I know ya from somewhere. Ya been he re before. And ya don't belong here. I don't trust ya. More than that, I don't like the w ay ya look. Whaddya tryin to steal here, mister? I don't like ya at all. Maybe I should call the pol ice. W hadday a got in that blac k bag of ye rs?\" The tirade took Marc abac k. The almost telepathic rea ding of his guilt, knocked him off bala nce and ga ve him a fright. Brus hing by he r rapidly, he pressed the eleva tor butt on, but had to wai t by the elev ator. \"Who y a gonna steal from? Huh, and a nyhow, w hat's yer name? Maybe I'll ge t the manage r.\" But t he ele vator came. Out of f right, Gladys didn't enter the lift with him. FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 59House Calls Gladys' words ricocheted in his brain as the ele vator ascended. The e ffect of her ass ault prevented him from noticing the ele vator's odor s. As he exited, he pa used and rearranged his emotions to pr epare for the ensuing financia l and social events. Whe n he finally entered Ruth's apartment, she noticed his agi tation. Taking them a s a sign that he was not feeling w ell, she ordered him to sit down. Ruth bega n, \"I vill make you some tea. V ait, don't get up. Y ou aren't vell Dr. Profess or. Even I can see dat. I vill be mitt you in von minute. Are you sick? Va t happened, Dr. Marc? You needn't come to bring de computer ven you a ren't vell.\" Soon she w as at his side with a pot of tea. And ag ain, a small saucer of cookies. Marc smiled in gratitude, and rela xed in the c hair. After a moment or two, and a portion of the cookies, he took out the computer, set it on the table, a nd plugged i t in. He took out the speakers and hea dphones fr om the Ra dio Shac k bag. Fina lly he plugged i n the headphone s. \"Why don't you put these headphone s on - her e I'll show you how. Now let's boot it up, Ruth.\" And Ruth log ged herself in with her password. With the headset on she wa s surpris ed to hear, quite loud and cl ear, the W indows' fanfare. \"Vas dis alvays here? Dis music?\" M arc took pride in her surpr ise and delig ht. She sat there beaming and started to s tand up to give Marc a hug, but the cord wasn't long enoug h. Marc lifted the headset off of her very scantily haired skull. \"Vonderful! How vonde rful!\" Ruth bega n. \"Herr Doctor P rofes sor Marc, I am so happy for vat you ha ve done for me. I hope you don't mind I call you Marc, Herr Doctor P rofes sor. I feel almost you are really family. If my son ver here he wud show me too just dis vay. Now take some cookies for de day, ple ase. For me. I vud vant dat. How ca n I dank you? Now tell me, va t do I have to do to al vays hea r de computer so? \" Marc showed her how to plug in the hea dphones, and then sat down to sip his tea. \"'You know , Marc, you are a life saver.

W hen I heard that he die d it brought back all the memories of los ing my Dad. I ended up pretty active in the anti-wa r movement. And it led me to even c hange what I was studying. I moved from ethics to political philosophy. I spoke at anti-war rallies.\" \"Vore cha nges us. It is alvay s a very bad time. V en de vor is good or bad it is people who a re killed.\" A silence passed as they both got lost in t heir thoughts. T hen with a big intake of breath, Ruth cha nged the subject to business: \"And va t do I owe for dis repair? Vat did you hav e to do for me? \" Marc explai ned that he w asn't sur e whic h she would prefer, the speakers or t he hea dphones. He showed her how the speake rs plugged i n. He said he ove rlooked the plug whe n he first took home the lap top, so all she owe d was the $150 for the two visits plus the time (another $75), and the cost of either the phones or t he speake rs. In the end she choose the speakers, and he set them up for FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 60House Calls her. He repac ked the hea dphones to retur n them, and a fter a bit more tea, some more warm words, and the rece ipt of the check, he left her, having be en give n an open inv itation to visit wheneve r he would like . She ke pt the door open and wa tched him go to the el evator. \"Dank y ou once more Profess or Marc,\" she called. \"And you, Ruth. The cookie s were wonderful.\" \"I am so glad.\" He could still see her standing there from within the eleva tor as t he doors closed. In t he eleva tor M arc thought about his use of her f irst name, his enjoy ment of the cookies. He felt something fundamental had c hange d in their relationship. As a philosopher of ethics he certainly kne w wha t it was. Socia l distance fac ilitates the justification of hurt ing someone. It's hard to hur t someone to whom you are conne cted. He ha d lectured enoug h about this as evidence against ethical intuition. Hurting someone you don't hardly know might be e asier, but the act is just as bad as hurt ing someone you know well. Marc now knew Ruth in a di fferent way. They ha d shared personal matters . She ha d taken c are of him, acce pted him in an une xpected fa shion. Wasn't she more or les s his age? Hadn't they had similar loss es? Could he really take a way her financia l security for his own? All these questions roiled in his mind and the associated fee lings made a ny thought of executing his plans far mor e problematic. Of cours e, he still had the i nformation. His copy of Ruth's f inanci al information was like a switch: he could use it if nee ded. He c ould siphon funds to st abiliz e his own life. W hy not? Marc was astounded that he once assigned volumes analy zing these sorts of ethical qua ndaries. There were whole classes in which he discussed thought 'experiments' that people ran. In these experiments ethicists inquir ed why people find it ea sier to pull a switch that kills one anonymous person but s aves five than to push a fat man, w ho is s tanding nex t to you on a bridge, to his death to save the same five. The switch is alw ays much ea sier. Pr oximity of any sort emphasizes the moral quandary. A nd Marc had gotten close to R uth. Marc tried to r eason that his case wa s diff erent. Wa sn't he being asked to dive off the br idge himself in a heroic ac t just s o Ruth Dedrick w as to be more comfort able? Didn't his pleasure have the same ethica l status as hers? His acce ss to her funds should allow him to share in the comfort they could rende r. But there were doubts. Jus t because he could share her wea lth, it seemed it would be ha rder to hur t the woman wi th whom he had shared so much. This jumble of thoughts were still in his head as he cross ed the lobby' s floor , toward the door where the unobserved Glady s was waiting. \"Ya weren't here long , were y a? Ya be tter not come back he re, mister. I can tel l a crook whe n I smell one. I got a good nose, I do. Now ya get out a here a nd don't ever come ba ck.\" He r assault had less effect than earlie r. But in his rus h to get out, he ac cidently brus hed up ag ainst her going out the door, causing her to loose her balanc e. He didn' t respond when she fell on her grocery bag. Eggs spilled out onto the floor and soiled her robe. As he left, she curs ed him with a rowdy, \"Y a fucker!\" Hours later Marc was in the Sa feway . Since Elsa died, Marc disliked shopping for f ood. Mealtime wa s lonely. Looking for and preparing food to prepare for only himself r eenforced the FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 61House Calls walls of his solitude. Even the pa ckaging conspired to reenforce this. Except for a few frozen meals, the pac kaging of foods was made for families. To make a hamburger, he had to buy a pound of chopped mea t. Eac h chicke n weig hed four or m ore pounds. I t was difficult to find package s for a dec ent solo diner. Often the uninspir ed ac tivity of solitary food s hopping would bring Marc's mind back to the early da ys of his marriage. Then he w ould hunt in gourmet food s tores and choose raspber ries, great mustards , prosciuto, and fancy c heeses for Elsa and himself. Meals were different. Breakfa sting across from one another at the kitchen table they would rea d the Post , discuss the news and the da y ahe ad. W hat were brea kfasts now? As he passed the eggs, he reflecte d on his last encounter with Gladys and then his confused relations with Ruth. His plans left a distinct foul taste in his m outh, and a fog in his mind: just when he most needed cla rity. He wondered if R uth was the only cl ient he woul d get. If he had others, perhaps he wouldn't nee d to borr ow from her accounts. He was preoccupi ed as he stared at the meats. His cell phone rang . He had to put down his shopping basket, and then fish for it, f irst in his jacket and then in his pants. But by the time he got it out, the ringing had stopped. \"I don't want beef,\" he conclude d, looking a t the myriad of red, blood stained pack ages in fr ont of him. Finding a small pac kage of chicken thig hs and throwing them in his basket, he drifted to coffees and sugar. Why ha d he undercut his marriage with those affairs? Elsa didn't help e ither. All those nights when she claimed she wa s working late at the Penta gon, he thought whil e looking for the chea pest coffee. No more coffees at Starbucks. Not even dece nt home made e spresso. Whatever wa s the bargain of the we ek. His firs t big financia l pinch ca me with those prescription bills , those experimental medicine s for her treatments. Each pill c ost mor e than a hundred dollars, even after the insurance. He ha d complaine d, but what good did tha t do? Every trip he had made to the drug store drained his will to take ca re of her. Elsa's cance r was a sponge, soaking up his life savings. And Elsa ha d stopped working. The can of coffee he me ant to drop into the basket slipped, and fell on to the floor. A slight, and young er, woman pic ked it up and ha nded it to him with a smile. \"Thank you so much,\" ca me the automatic respons e of all that he thought he was going to say. But he heard himself continue, \"It isn't easy. It's not nice, c ooking only for myself. Sitting at home, at the kitche n table. A lone. Going out to buy stuff t o cook, only for me. I . . .\" The woman's smile disappeared, repla ced by a look of unea se. The shadow of her invitation to communicate w as withdrawn. Marc felt emba rrassed by the tumble jumble of words, his lack of self control, his vulnerability , his age. W hat wa s he thinking? He turned and hurried fur ther down the aisle for sugar. He wa s carrying the bag of groceries to his car when Marc reca lled that his cell phone had rung. He put down the groce ries and found a message had bee n left by Margery, Frances' assist ant. She had recommende d him to a second clie nt. Would he pl ease ca ll the clie nt, a Ve ritas T ablea u. Ms Tableau w as sight impaired and nee ded software to magnify her computer screen.

FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 62House Calls And ag ain, life see med to take a nother for tuitous t urn. Ins oluble problems were put on bac k burners , reprieves were give n. How his fort unes seemed to be on a roller-coaster. His fut ure, now brighter, seemed far less charted than he ever would ha ve supposed. FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 63CHAPTER 12: SPOON For M arc, Ve ritas T ablea u was not only an unusual na me, but one with quite a legacy. 'Truth Tables' - perhaps a credible translation - ha d been his b\u00eate noire since he first encountered them in graduate school. Indee d, the name rec alled those pesky little exercises in logic, each with an opaque structure s uch as: Premise 1: Moriart y can commit crimes without leaving any trace of evidence . Premise 2: Sherlock Holmes ca n find evidenc e eve n when there w as none. To prove: Either Doctor Watson is indispens able or Sherlock alwa ys gets his m an. Thus , her name ill uminated the tie be tween Marc's genuine inadequa cies in matters of analysis and their constr aining role i n his career. Needle ss to say, the name i gnited his imagina tion. The idea of taking on Truth T able he rself, and be sting her to achieve hi s own financial stability, gav e him a rare moment of joy. His anticipation of reveng e was sweet. As he reflected on the justice of it all , he reca lled the ha ted logici an, John Smallw ood. Indeed, the plea sure of planning to flee ce Veritas Tableau wa s heightened by the conce it that any such theft would al so be an attac k on logic i n general and Profess or Smallwood in pa rticular. It gave Marc a moment to put a new shine on his caree r. After all, others also des pised Smallwood, or Peckerwood, a s Marc preferred to call him, for his cowardly silence on the war in Vi etnam. There was his memory of the pos t Christmas bombing exc hange in January of 1973. Pec kerwood, in his dark 3 piec e suit, had come into Marc's office, without knocki ng. Marc had c ome bac k from his class and had his feet up on his desk, reading the Cornell Sun . He wa s wearing jea ns and a flannel shirt. \"I hear some of our non-tenured prof essor s are dress ing inappropriately in cla ss,\" the intruder began. \"No! How so?\" \"They nd \"Unbelie vable ! Is t here a doc ument that spells out t he sartorial regulations?\" \"Don't make li ght of tr adition Buttervogel! It is what makes a university great.\" \"Do the traditions have sanctions? I f so, what might the punishment be?\" \"Tenure time is when discuss ions of compatibility and fit are raised.\" \"Is that a threat?\" \"Of course not, jus t an observation.\" \"Whil e we are making observations, let me note that the war is a threat to our nation as a whole . One eve n more notable than the sloppiness of our junior faculty's attire. I think all philosophers have to ba nd together to st op Nixon and Kissinger fr om destr oying the w orld.\" \"I believe you mea nt herd together, as in sheep. I refus e to be one of a c rowd, especia lly a crowd that support s cowardice a nd communists .\" FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) logician and losopher of s cienc e, spoke up at Marc's tenure review. From Pr ofess or Blowman's ac count, Pecke rwood began by assert ing that philosophy's singular job was the logic al and clea r headed a nalysis of arguments. Smallw ood had ca lled Marc's research papers unpublishable, mere thinly v eiled, third-r ate edi torials. He then dredged up Marc's affair with El sa and his leade rship of st udent rallies aga inst the war. He raised the observation that Marc made mocke ry of tr adition by his habit of going to c lass in outf its more suitable to mowing one's law n. His closing comment was that \"Profess or Buttervogel is totally inc apabl e of solving the simplest f reshman level problems in logic. \" Marc's st ruggle for tenure was doomed thereafter. Marc's anger wa s rekindle d just thinking about all this aga in. In contrast to the logicia n, Marc understood t hat the quali ty of a man, or a philosopher, wa sn't determined by a nalysis: it was disposit ion, virtue, and know ledge of what must be done. Marc was not wasting his time on narrow linear proofs and public ations. He wa s wrest ling with the e vils of war, that grea t scourge of human hist ory. If t his noble cause wa s not t o be rewa rded, so be it. Peckerwood ma y have had his many a rticles about arcane , foolish details of logic and number theory, and he ma y have forced Marc to move to Maryland, but Peckerwood ne ver had adoring students line up a t his door . Nor could he eve r pos sess the fabulous body of Elsa, the depa rtment's most beautiful, and liberated, g raduate student. She had ma rched out of Peckerwood's office, right into Marc's bed. So much for the little logicia n. Marc half belie ved these self-just ificatory tale s. At this moment, the conclusion of the syllogism came to him clea rly: \"Maybe I didn 't pub lish a lot. And maybe I didn't a lways have cohere nt argum ents. But ask my students. They learned wha t was right, and what wa s evil in my classes. During Vietnam, women's lib, fighting the Evil Em pire, I spelled it out for them. I was one of those w ho mobiliz ed the fists that sm ashed th e face of evil, that cha nged the world! Peckerwo od? You sat with your ye llow pad s to decide if Mor iarty could be cau ght given the premises in the exercise. Your articles were all too soo n forgo tten. I'm Marc Buttervo gel. The o rganizers of SDS and Direct Action met in my office!\" As he went through these self-congratulatory memories, images of the large rallie s in fr ont of Willa rd Str aight Ha ll, the C ornell student union, roiled in his mind. He was standing before thousands of aroused and chee ring students , urging them to withhold their telephone tax. The illegitimate gove rnment's t ax used to pay for the wa r! He could hea r his wor ds: \"Don't pay y our tax! Stop the war! Bring the troops home, and stop the spread of American evil!\" His flowing blond hair and be ard were ce rtain to show up charismatically on the front page of the Cornell Sun a fter each rally . Students s aid he l ooked like Jesus . But as he r an through his rum inations he found himself back in Takoma Park. On a day w here those dreams had ended long a go. Perhaps back then, Marc ha d a real pe rsona. Not now. Then, he was somebody. The coeds loved him. He was releva nt. But now he was a small time con-man. A parasite on the county's poor elderly we lfare clie nts. And it was in that role he wa s about to pick up the phone to ca ll a ve ry real Ve ritas T ablea u. She had be en softened up by the helpful mag ic of the Buss a branch of the C ounty We lfare Bureau. S he had muc h to be thankful for: her new large screen TV, he r monthly homemaking service to help her scrub down her small but adequate living qua rters. The list went on. During Margery's s emi-annual visit, Vera admitted that she didn't use sof tware FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 65Spoon that enlarge d the screen image s to r eadable size ha dn't been installed. Margery had immedia tely taken a ction and c ontacted Marc to arrange hi s services. And so, when the phone rang, without really ascertaining w hether the cal l was from an eagl e scout or a s hyster, Vera had pic ked up the phone, and hea ring a request for Veritas Tableau she responded, \"Why, no one eve r calls me Veritas. I am Mrs . Vera Table au. Now w hat is it that you want?\" Whe n Marc identified himself as the 'Prof essor ' who would i nstall the soft ware, she urged that Marc come as soon as poss ible to fix her computer. The thought of cheating a V eritas Tableau had l ost none of its savor when Marc entered his car. He wa s eager. Ea ger and ea rly. The route to Vera's place from Takoma Park didn't have to go through downtown Silver Spring, nor past his f inanci er's place in the E verett Building. Perhaps the joyous venom of the moment drove him there inadvertently, a nd then by the copy shop where he'd gotten his busines s cards. M arc realiz ed he w as early, a nd so s topped in the Parkway Deli for a coffee and Da nish. Getting out of t he ca r it came to him that he ha dn't done something this extravag ant, this expansive, for months . Within a wink, he remembered Ruth's investment acc ount, and the mag ic of AUC H145. Ev en without the pilfering of Veritas, the password gave him the security to tr eat himself. Returning to the ca r, the Cava lier's door lock seemed frozen. It wouldn't turn with the key. Struggling to open the door Marc came to consider it a replace able pi ece of junk. With the dreams of income security from his new role, he pictured himself soon in t he market for a new c ar. And thus ended any resistance to his material greed. In fr ont of him was the pot of gold at the end of the proverbial rainbow: the a ll America n cornucopia of imag ined consumer goods. Materialism was to blow out virtue one more time. Thirt y minutes later, after overcoming the frozen door lock, he found himself at Claridge House - a nice ly designed fa cility w ith its own landscaping in the front. The rear of the Claridge bordered on a la rge junk ya rd. The cheaper apa rtments , like the one rented by Ve ra with a little he lp from t he government, we re on the lower floors, f acing the back . He parked i n the landscape d front parking lot, and took the ele vator to the four th floor. Vera opened the door. With one foot alrea dy in the a partment, Marc introduced himself, \"Hello, I'm Prof essor Buttervogel. But please c all me Marc. I assume you are Mrs. T ablea u.\" \"Well bless you, Prof essor , do come He perused both her and the surr oundings. Tableau w as a bit overwei ght, with long, sloppily brushed, uneve nly cut, gray hair. It held an off-center brown hair comb that still had some of its rhinestones pasted to its s pine. She was wea ring a florid and long house coa t fastened with a doze n or so small buttons . Her thick ankl es were lac ed with blue veins. These led his eyes to a pair of rather old soiled, once-maroon slippers. Her f ace was set, rock like, a nd she was looking a t him with what he c ould only ide ntify the forced hospitality of a reluctant C hristian. Table au wa s the picture of congea led wil lpower impoverished by the ine vitable forces of time. She wore g lasses with a thick, bright green, translucent plastic frame. The apartment presented itself easily: two doors of f of the entrance room: presum ably to a bath and to a be droom. A small galle y kitche n showed itself along the rear wa ll. It had a small counte r where two c ould eat c omfort ably. Everything see med cle an exc ept an old dirty percola tor that had its light on. Toward the left of t he kitche n area the w all was covered wi th a floral print wallpa per. They looked lik e roses. Aff ixed to them wa s a wooden three-barred Ea stern rthodox crucifix. FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 66Spoon Just at the edge of the kitchen area , hanging on the wal l was wha t appea red to be an old woode n rack holding some spoons. It was attac hed to the wa ll nea r the eating counte r. Off t o his right he s pied a rela tively ne w, large flat screen, digital TV. It was on. A computer was also nea r it. Some overstuf fed furnitur e with la rge flower print coverings and a small table were scattered about in the rest of t he room. There were no other decorations on the walls, no pictures. \"Well, we ll. They hav e sent me a profess or! Jus t because I ca n't see well, I get a profess or! I wonder wha t sort of fella they'd a told me to call i f I was blind and deaf! I didn't think it would take a profess or to s olve my c omputer problems . Now may be if you we re comin' over to help me w ith some bigger things: like wha t to do with my life. But then you'd have to be a sort of philosophy profes sor, not one of these computer ones. Where do you tea ch, and how come if you're a profes sor you're fixing my c omputer? I could tell it wa sn't charity when you told me about that minimum charge. If I could see, I'd sur ely go out of my way to figure out how to do it so I wouldn't be pay ing you.\" All of whic h was said a bit sardonical ly, but with a n impish s mile as an accompaniment. \"I'm a retired profes sor. They ca ll people like me professor emeritus,\" he said although this honorific title had not been g iven to him by the phil osophers at Maryland. \" I do this to st ay busy.\" \"Well, this should be a simple job. Wa nt a cup of coffee?\" \"Sure, that'd be nic e.\" \"Suga sugar, if you have some.\" A mbling over to the once w hite plastic percola tor she took out two white coffee c ups and mismatched saucers. but, in a gesture to his s tatus as an educate d man, she put them both back. She opened the other ca binet, and rea ched for what appe ared to be much fancie r cups. T hen, as he w atched, she leane d over to her little rack for a spoon. She carefully put his coff ee, along with the sugar and a paper napki n, on the small table ne xt to the arm chair. Vera then sat down on the sofa with he r cup of coffee. \"This is going to be a n easy job for a profes sor. Whe n you're done I'll be a ble to see enough of wha t is on the s creen so I can do the rest myself next time. Do you hav e any kids, prof essor ?\" \"None.\" Marc w as impatient to get this chit-chat over with. He sipped the stale brew that had obviously sat far too long in the machine. Its bitterness led him to reach for the spoon and extra sugar. The s poon had a ni ce fee l, and a n old satin finish t hat instinctively le d him to turn it over. He wa s surpris ed to see an old c yrillic imprint of a silver smith, another certifying st erling, and what he took to be the Romanov seal of the Russian tsars . He estimated the spoon to be at lea st 160 ye ars old. He looked a t it again. It was an ornate, floral design, similar to many that we re attributed to European silversmiths in the ninetee nth century. How ea sy it would be to pocke t the spoon, or even better, get the set off t he wa ll. Marc wa s momentarily lost t rying to develop a plan to gain possess ion of the spoons . She obviously w ould miss them. Vera sat opposite, and a lthough macula r degeneration ha d ravage d her eyesight in the c enter of her field of vision, it was much kinder at the periphery. So w hile it appe ared that she was wa tching his face, she ac tually w as watching his hands, and had beg un to tell him the stor y of her spoons : how at the time of the revolution the Tablinskovich family , her husband's, had left with the spoons and a few gilde d, beautiful R ussian tea cups. These heirlooms had ac companie d the family in thei r search FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 67Spoon for asylum all around the world. \"W ould you wa nt to s ee the other cups? They are eac h painted differently.\" \"Sorry,\" Marc responded, \"Wha t did you say?\" And although she more or less r epeated herself, Vera had a notion that something was out of kilter. How could this profess or have bee n so los t in thought over a spoon? \"...a nd so I was wondering if you w ould want to see the other cups.\" \"That would be fun, but I should also take a serious look at your computer, to ins ure that there is no diff iculty in the software installation. Perhaps I should look at the computer firs t.\" With Ve ra leading, he w ent over to the PC, ca rrying his cup and spoon. While he was behind, he slipped the spoon into his pocket. The PC w as quite new, a nd he noted that it wa s not pass word protected. It seemed to have nothing on the desktop other than the sof tware that ca me with it once it was up and running. \"The machine doesn't look like it has seen a l ot of heavy use.\" \"No it's not. I can't rea lly see the screen, so I can't use it. That's why I need that vision enhanc ing software installed.\" \"OK, let me just see whether you ha ve a l arge enoug h hard drive and enoug h memory for t he software.\" After a moment he wa s able to report that all was ready. \"We 're set, but I think I s hould go out and ge t some DVDs to make a back up of your system before we install further s oftware. That will help in c ase something goes wrong.\" The viewing of the cups was thus put aside for the indefinite present and Marc left with a promis e of only a short absence. In the ele vator, Marc embellished his plan. He 'd go to a precious metals or antique dea ler to have the spoon assess ed. If it was worth what he thought, he'd see where he c ould pick up similarly styled spoons out of s tainless, go back a nd swap the new for t he old when he installed the software. The blind old lady wouldn't eve r even notice the difference. He dec ided to take the loop around Laytonsville R oad bac k to downtown. It led him past the Walter Ree d Annex. A lthough a hospital it wa s still a milita ry base. Many of the personnel were more educate d than at other bases, but the installation still had some of the typical properties of any military base. There we re the small stor es near the gate s of t he base: c offee shops , luncheon pl aces, used car deal ers, a tub reglaze r, a small hardware store, a tire stor e. And, passing the gate , there it was: the coin de aler, wi th a big sandwic h board sign outs ide. The sign read, \" Sell Your Gold H ere: We Meet A ny Advertised Pr ices! \" Marc pulled ove r to s ee if there was someone in the store who could assess the spoon. The door was locke d, and whe n Marc press ed the button, the salesperson ins ide buzz ed him in. She was a brunette, wi th green eye s, dress ed in a pa le green c otton tee. The nipples on her perky breasts impr essed thems elves on the fabric. But he had business to trans act. The brunette, howe ver, wasn't going to be rushed. \"Well, sir, good morning. Or is it already afternoon?\" She turned around to look at the elec tric clock na iled to the dark woode n paneli ng behind he r. \"Nope. Just thought I'd s ail right into my lunch hour but too early. Any how, you c ame knoc king. W hat ca n I do for you?\" He pulled the spoon out of his pocket, and put it on a small bla ck vel vet pad that w as lying on the counter. \"I have a small set of t hese spoons . They are a family hei rloom. I t hink they c ould be valua ble. C ould you give me some estimate of what I could get for four of them?\" Behind the counter, the young w oman picke d up the spoon and turned it over in her hand. \"Honey, I could tell you w hat I'd pay for it, but that wouldn't make sense. I don't buy this s ort of FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 68Spoon thing. We just deal in coins - you know , from t he guys at the hospital. For us, any other silver or gold we buy we just buy by weig ht. But t his looks old, and is s ilver. Wha t's the s tory on it? If I was wanting to c heck it out, I'd go on line , or to an estate auction house. There's one downtown in Silver Spring. W hat do you know about the detai ls of t his thing?\" She put the spoon back on the counter. A few mea ningless pleasantries later, he wa s leaving the store, with a ne w destination: the downtown estate dea ler. A refurbished s ign in the wi ndow of the stand alone old house on Fenton Street read 'Finer's Estate Auctions and Antiques.' No perky brea sts and soft green tees here. Jus t Mr. F iner in a ca refully tailored suit. Finer was all business, and business was not good. \"It's a beautiful piece ; I'll look at it,\" w as Finer's r esponse when Marc displayed the spoon. Finer took out a small magnifying g lass and examine d the spoon carefully. Holding both the spoon and the mag nifier, he then disappea red into a bac k room. After a few minutes, he came back w ith a big ca talogue a nd the spoon. Putt ing the spoon back on the c ounter, he opened the c atalog ue to a page with pictures of s poons. \"Here it is. From Russ ia, mid 19 century. Sterling. Good c ondition. One isn't very useful. Ath set would be nice r. Of cours e the listing value in the ca talogue i s totally out of date. Eve ryone now wants to sell things, to get cash. But no one wants to buy. I'd s ay hold i t for 3 yea rs and see wha t happens. You don't w ant to sell it in this market.\" \"Well, wha t's its value in today's market?\" \"Here on the ba ck of the see the small AK?\" Anotonovic h Kovalsky. He was working mainly i n the firs t half of the 19 century. Some of his work was for the T sar's family. A nd thisth seems to be one such spoon - here,\" a nd now Mr. Finer t urned the spoon s o the light reflected off a small crest, \"here you ca n see the Roma nov seal.\" \"Yes. That is what my pa rents t old me too.\" \"So the spoon has some his tory, some value.\" \"Right.\" \"I would assume it was made in a bout 1840 and, g iven that it is in good, but not exce llent condition, it's estimated value would be a bit below $2 50. Perhaps $245.\" \"Why 'd you say not exc ellent c ondition?\" \"The scratches, and the ellent mea ns like new.\" \"Oh.\" \"But as I was saying, no one is buying today. E veryone is a selle r. You'd be surpris ed at the quality of things that you ca n find in pawn shops as families are trying to get cash for their heirlooms. Melt it down and you'd hav e about $50 . But even at a g ood auction today , one spoon like this is likely to fetch le ss than $100. In a set it could g o for mor e. But you could wa it a long time to move the item. And the n, you'd ha ve to pay our commiss ion. You c ould try to s ell it on the internet, of cours e. Or to a small shop antique dea ler like the one s in Kensington. I'd t hink either of thos e might work better for you. How long hav e you ha d it in the family?\" FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 69Spoon \"Well, I have a small set.\" \"Good. But s till you hav e to figure that in the current market you'll be l ucky to ge t much more than 1/3 it's catal ogue va lue.\" \"I can't beli eve tha t when I am finally needing to sell, I can't get its value.\" \"Right. But everyone's selling. Now's the to buy.\" \"My luck. Ne ver the best.\" \"Well, if you nee d the money, y ou are lucky to have inhe rited the spoons .\" \"I'll have to think about it.\" \"Of course. T ake y our time. I'm alway s here.\" A few ple asantries and Marc had left. Marc left the establishment calcula ting. Almost $250 ea ch, perhaps more than a grand for a set. Taking Finer's discount as gos pel, he w ould still easily net $33 0. Better than nothing. Marc smiled at his thought of s ettling in to a c areer as a petty thie f in his r etirement. He proceede d to a paw n shop on Georgia Avenue in search of a che ap spoon of s imilar pattern. The pawn shops were lined up. One or two still had C hristmas decorations in the window. E ach had a di splay of what wa s availa ble inside. Sig ns in the windows advertized e asy money for just about any thing. Just entering one of them put him light ye ars away from t he high drea ms of riches he once held with Julia Burnham in her swank offices in the Eve rett B uilding. In his s econd pa wn shop he found a reasonably simila r spoon. Not st erling, not old, it wa s made by Oneida. It ca me in a not so complete set of flatware for 6 table settings: $12. Not quite the same heft, a tad shorter, rounder in the bowl, a nd with an unw anted dimple in the handle . Stainless, which ha d a darker hue tha n silver. Yet in other way s it wasn't a bad match. Marc thought about her vision and dec ided it would do. He put the boxed purchase under his arm, and wa lked back to the c ar. In the car he took out 4 spoons f rom the box, slipped them into his pocket, and put the rest of the box on the bac k seat. He hea ded bac k to Mr s. Tablea u conce ntrating on the details of the planned theft. Paying a ttention to driving was beyond him. His hands sweated. He pulled ove r to quiet his nerves. He had ne ver fully plotted a theft. Wa s he sur e he w anted to go through with this? What if he we re caught? But how could that be? He shook off t he jitters and start ed up ag ain. He hadn't gone but a few bloc ks when a c op turned on a siren behind him. He couldn' t believe he wa s on his way for a heist and the cops were pulling him ove r. The police woma n came to his window. \"Don't you pay attention to stop s igns, old man?\" \"Sorry sir , I didn't see it.\" Marc couldn't ve he a ddress ed her as \"Sir.\" \"They are bright red, big things at most bus y corners. And passing thr ough them is a lot of bucks and a me ss of points . Let me have your registr ation and li cense.\" She left to check him out and then returned. \"I'm so s orry M a'am, I think I'm jus t very nervous. Some bad new s today in the family, a nd what wi th no job to help out.\" FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 70Spoon \"If you're too nervous to drive safely you ought to pull ove r and rest. L ook, I'll give y ou a warning this time. But don't dr ive if you c an't pay attention.\" Marc was a puddle of nerves. He couldn't continue to drive. He pulled ove r, tur ned off the engine and stepped out of the car. He immedi ately felt nauseous. Suddenly it hit him that he w as entering an e ntirely new w orld. He was for all practica l purposes an al ien, a n outlaw - or planning to be. The police i ncident demonstrated this new social position upon Marc. This was a ne w dimension of vulnerability. The realiza tion was dizzy ing. R egardless of his lack of money, a nd his earlier lack of family suppor t, he had ne ver had this feeling of being outside the la w, outside of his community. But it wasn't only a t the gut level tha t things altered. Marc's new status forced him to reflect on what he had taught, a nd what he ha d avoide d teachi ce nter of his profes sional conce rns was an understanding of the relationship of t he citiz en to the state. As he stood ther e by the side of the road, it wa s this understanding that he felt dissolve. Marc suddenly realiz ed he ha d alwa ys focused on the st ate's illeg itimacy - in war, in segregation, a nd in sexism. Sure all the cla ssics also dealt wi th the duties of citizenship, the rights of property, and the legitima cy of community la ws. But he had skipped over those s ections. He al ways presumed the perspective of a respected membe r of t he community. The state wa s alway s the outlaw. Now he understood his relationship with his community was cha nging permane ntly. He ha d stepped outside the circle, outside the boundaries of the philosophical lessons he taught. A s he calmed dow n he asked himself, \"Should I go through with this? Is it wo rth it?\" But even as he asked the que stion he felt the answer loud and cle ar. Now wa s not a time for him to change course. \"If this is what i s necessary , so be it,\" he bravely suggested to hims elf. And then just when he most needed it, a w onderful and refres hing stream of jus tification ca me to him from the renega des of political theory - Nietzsche, Ge net, Sartre. One ca n't be bound by la w, by convention; it is nece ssary to see beyond the m. With a ne w sense of purpos e and righteousness he reentered the ca r. His heart was beating rapidly . His temples pounded and he ima gined the sounds could be he ard outside the car. He put his fingers on his temples to feel his pulsating arteries. A bird crapped to the le ft of t he crac k in his windshield. It splattered widely. He looked up too late to see the bird. But Marc found t he incide nt humorous and it ca lmed him. So many times he ha d just taken what the w orld dished out. B ut this t ime, God damn it, he was going to fight back . He would g rab what he c ould. Eve ryone else did. He took the old Che vy bac k on the road treating its old gears unkindly with a faster and more aggressive clutch. Marc wa s heade d back to 242 3 Lyttonsville Road, Apt. 4F to get his. While he drove he rea lized tha t his demeanor could make Mrs. Tableau suspicious. He practiced some mea ningless pleasantries with a ca lm tone: \"Hell o Mrs . Tableau. Here I am, bac k with the nee ded media . I can't belie ve it, but I found I had slipped your spoon into my pocket with my key s and junk. We ll let's get that old computer so it will be functiona l for you.\" No, too hurr ied. \"Hi a gain Mrs. T ablea u. I guess I wasn't gone long enough to be missed! I hope you didn't hunt for your s poon, cause I found it looped in my ke y ring when I got to the ca r. Let me clea n it for you.\" \"Christ, I need to be cal mer.\" But then all too soon, he was there, in the ele vator of the Claridge house. FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 71Spoon A thief, one w ho is to perf orm the theft as a mag ic act, in front of his victim, mus t be cal m. Calm and coll ected. He must r ehearse the conjuring trick until he is sure that the rabbit is certain to come out of the hat. The ca rd he will ide ntify will be the right one. Marc wa sn't a prof essional. Indeed, he w asn't even a n amateur. Marc wa s a firs t-timer. A fir st timer who wa s banking on the blindness of his victim, eve n as he wa s to be inst alling software so that she could see her computer screen. Marc wasn't prepared for his m agic show. FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 72CHAPTER 13: FIRST TIMERS Marc had left and V era had c losed the door when she realize d there hadn't bee n a man in he r apartment for years: since the plumber came to fix the sink. Ve ra wondered just how long a go that had bee n. She turned to pick up the professor 's coffee cup. It wasn't on the table, a nd that left her a bit disoriented. She sat down a nd tried to reconst ruct where the cup might be . Recalling that the Professor had gone to the computer, Vera pic ked herself up, and wa lked ove r to the computer. There it was, her little treasure. Picking it up brought back a rush of memories of Ivan and the life they had shared. These left her so light headed tha t Vera couldn' t make it to the sink. She sat bac k down on the hea vy upholstered chair. Her big bosom heav ed as she mourned her Ivan's pass ing. On Saturday, she hadn' t even thought about Va lentine's Day, but now that it had bee n forgott en, it seemed monumenta l. How often they ha d given e ach other a small box of chocolate in the shape of a hea rt, and excha nged Ha llmark greetings! They would l augh, e ven danc e, in their cozy apartment ac ross town, and have some liquor or a hot tea in the se little cups. The dainty golden ropes covering the rims of the cups and the spoons tied her to her Ivan, and the Tablinkoviche s. Their continued presence i n her life brought her comfor t and a sense of continuity. Seven y ears ago, whe n Ivan had die d, her sight was already going. Then, wi thout him, she had moved to this apartment. It was s maller, more confining. But also more manage able. Sitting there, she recalle d his s car, under his eye, but was a bit dissatisf ied with he rself when she coul d recall neither on which side it w as nor what had ca used it. She closed her ey es to get a cle arer image, and dozed off. When she w oke, Ve ra was startled to find hers elf in the big c hair. As the sleep lifted and he r mind clea red, she realize d she no longer had the coffee c up in her hand. That gav e her at lea st two conscious reasons not to get up. Firs t, she had no incentive to distur b the plea sant wave tha t had submerged her while da ydreaming of her husband. She w as also awa re that the cup could be caug ht in the folds of her robe. So Vera be gan to che ck very c arefully the a cres of f loral print clothing wrapped a round the chair. There betwee n the faded ye llow roses and the still s omewha t greenish ferns , she saw the glint of the golden rim: the c up, and a bit furt her down, with a nother glint, the saucer. Unharmed. V era smiled at her luck, picked the m up and ventured off toward the sink. But before arriving at her destination, it occurred to her that she didn't have her spoon. So off s he we nt to hunt for it, firs t in the cushions of the chai r and then by the computer, a nd then back to the big chair and i ts cus hions. She was down on he r knees trying to feel under the chair whe n the door knocker sounded. \"One minute. Who is \"It's m or Buttervogel.\" \"Just a minute,\" she be gged. Hol ding on to the arm of the chair, she silently thanke d Jesus that her knees had hel d for yet one more trial, and ena bled her slow rise to an erect state. \"I'm coming, I'm coming,\" she said with an a ir of exhaustion. To her self s he continued to w onder where that spoon might lie. There st ood the Prof essor , in the open doorwa y, a bi t disheveled in his old gray popl in jac ket that was zippe d tight, discolored by dirt and moistur e, carrying a blac k computer bag in w hat looked like ve ry red, cold hands. His thinning gray ha ir was wet and he bega n talking ne rvously as s oon as FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 73First T imers the door was opened. \"I'm bac k! Got the DVD, and I'll ge t to the sof tware right off. Hope you weren't looking for your s poon: it got caug ht in my stuf f, and I found it when I got to the car. Anyhow , I'll get it to you straight away ,\" and w ith that, Prof essor Butt ervogel be gan to search his pockets for t he spoon, firs t casually , and then w ith a bit of agitation. Fina lly, unz ipping his jack et, he searched his shirt pocket. W ith obvious relief he said \"Ah, got it. I'll cl ean it; it's the lea st I can do.\" And with this, he briskly came into the apartment. He pla ced his bag on the chair by the c omputer, took off his jacket, hung it over the cha ir and turned to face her. Vera, w as a bit surpr ised at the coinc idence of the prof essor immediatel y mentioning the v ery spoon s he had just gotten on her knees to find. But s he wa s relieved and be lieved that these good things happened to her bec ause of her fealty. She stood t here, unconscious that her house coat wa s quite open now, and her night gow n showed her off in a manner that was cle arly not to her advantage. Since Iva n's death, no eye s, not even hers, had peered behi nd that house coat. After Ivan's exit, Vera ha d not found it necessary to keep up appea rances. Only her mac ular dege neration had le d her to doctors . Her age had bee n adva ncing in a ny ca se, but under the housecoat, aging had occ urred beyond the vi sible, like rot behind wa llpape r. The Pr ofess or, on the other hand, could av oid neither the evide nce of her decl ine nor the reminder her condition triggered regarding his own sad state. It was in this visual asses sment that he noticed the cup a nd saucer, still in Vera's hand. \"Oh, l et me clean the cup too,\" he said briskly, a nd forcefully took them from her grasp. Unfortunately, as he pulle d at the saucer, the c up lost its balance a nd bega n its inevitable trajectory obeyi ng Newton's all he avenl y bodies attract ea ch other. Its first collision was with the arm of the big cha ir, and there its gilded rim sparkled beautifully g olden in the la mp's light. It ricoche ted off the cushion, and thence onto the rug on the floor. For Vera the alteration in he r environment couldn't hav e bee n more drast ic had the door been opened to a thief or a rapist. Within seconds her equilibrium, her quiet seanc e with her poor dece ased Ivan had be en replac ed by what she projected surely must be the destruction of her heirloom. \"How c ould you? You destroyed it! Why did y ou grab it from me? \" How indee d, was also in Marc's mind. He had to ove rcome this nervous ness. What was he thinking? Pick up the cup, ge ntly: plea se don't be broken. \"I am sorr y. Really. Look, it is fine. I'm going to cle an this, and the spoon. Rea lly, nothing broken.\" He we nt to the sink, tur ned on the water, made a splash or two, and put the cup on the counter to dry. He then c arefully turned to take the remaining spoons fr om the spoon r ack, and replac e them with those that he had purcha sed at the pawn shop. Ms. T ablea u was fully distracted, havi ng now notice d that her robe needed buttoning. Flust ered, she had turned her back on the Prof essor . Happy w ith the transaction, and sure that the rabbit had been succ essfully pulle d out of the hat, he moved to the PC w ith the confidence that had esca ped him whe n he had e ntered the apa rtment. A few minutes later, the software installed, he was sitting next to Vera, and i nstructing her on the use of M agic Lens 5.1. A bit later, he w as gone, a nd Vera w as alone. S he sat at the PC pla ying w ith her newly visible toy. First a game, then the we b. The Washington Post. Obama was giving GM a lot more money. $4 bill ion. Who kne w? She smiled at her renewe d connec tion to the outs ide world. That prof essor , he knew what he w as doing. She got up slowly a nd maneuve red to the big chai r. A glint of gold from the r ug ca ught her eye. Carefully she bent down. There it was, most certain: a chi p from her cup. She pi cked it up ve ry gingerly a nd went over to the counter. Ve ra turned over the cup and felt with he r finger. It alwa ys FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 74First T imers had chips on the rim, but yes, here wa s a new one. She felt a w ave of sadness roll over her. Everything brea ks. Everything die s. Ins tinctively , she turned to gain solace from her spoons . They seemed so dark hanging in that wooden rac k on the wa ll. It mus t be later than she thought. But no, t he cloc k still showed early a fternoon. She turned on the light, and looke d out the window. The da y was actually clearing up a bit. There was some blue sky visible. W hateve r rain had come down seemed ove r. But the spoons still looked dark. Ve ra couldn't figure out why he r eyes were behavi ng this way. She picked one spoon off the rack, if only to fondle it, to rega in the comfort s he had lost when she wok e up from her nap. But at that very moment comfort traveled to a di fferent planet. Inst ead of her belove d spoon, the implement in V era's hand ga ve her a strange feel ing. Nothing about it felt right. It was too smooth, t oo cold, too light, too small. The handle didn't feel right. She put it on the counter and took another spoon out. I t felt the same. Indeed, it fit right on top of the firs t spoon: a match. Feeling li ght-headed, she he ld on to the edge of the c ounter. Vera wa s, perhaps f or the fir st time, doubting her senses . She turned those spoons over and over trying to make sense of t he anoma lous input that came from t hose hands. Slowly a conjec ture for med in her mind. Perhaps the anomaly wasn't in her head and hands, but in the spoons thems elves. Perhaps these weren't her spoons . And then, a s reality began to clarify, she suddenly screamed, \" Son of a bitch, he stole my spoons!\" loud enough to grab the attention of her ance stors and Ivan, were they up to listening. She pick ed up the remaining spoons . They were a ll the same. Not bothering to get dress ed, Ve ra put on her rain coat. She put the spoons in her pocket, and slammed the door behind her. Methodicall y she marched dow n the hall knoc king at he r neighbor's doors . After 3 failures, Jim was in at 4B. J im was a bit young er and of good sight. Skipping a ll pleasantries, displaying he r anger, she cut to the chase. \"I think I was just robbed. B y a da mn profes sor even. Oh, Jesus, please forgive me! I think he took my husband's family's spoons but I can't rea d with these damn ey es. Oh, Jesus , plea se for give this sinner. Can y ou just r ead the ba ck of these spoons for me? Do they have a little stamp to show they are silver?\" Jim was an elde rly, big, bla ck man. The dow nturn hadn't tr eated hi m kindly. He had lost his part time job as a night time ja nitor in the Discovery building. Losing one part time janitor meant that the assis tants to t he dea l makers at Discovery no longer got their desks dus ted twice a we ek. But f or Jim, it was mor e serious. P art time meant no bene fits. Part time meant no unemployme nt check. He wa s stretching everything to liv e on his Social Security che ck, and it wasn't working. Every so often his daughter would come ov er and bring him a big bag of groceries to ease the press ure. Jim never spoke very much and ha d certainly learned, ba ck in Al abama , not to initiate conversations with cuss ingly a ngry white folk. Se eing the fury in Ve ra's eyes, his speech was reduced to an exha led soft whist le. He the n gently took one of the spoons from her hand, a nd slowly examine d it. Then speaking slowly, i n a tone that showed some self-deprecation and roots, he said, \"You know , Vera Mam, I ain' t had a lot of silver in my hands. I sur e don't know w hat kinda stamp they'd a put on a spoon to s how it wa s silver. But this one sure as hell don't say silver. It s ays, cle ar as day 'Sta inless' and then 'China .' If you bought em thinking you w as buyin' silver you sure enough been robbed, la dy. W ho done it to you?\" \"I didn't buy it, Jim. The s poons were from m y husband's family. He w as from Russia and they brought it over when they ca me.\" FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 75First T don' say ? So this here are spos'd to be old fr om Russia. But I think these a lot newe r than we are. These ain't them. And if you didn' buy it, Ms . Vera, how you sayin' y ou was robbed?\" So Vera rec ounted what ha ppened, w ith all the de tails, including the chipped c up. Re living the story, Ve ra's anger reache d a new pitch. Jim listened to it all, right there at the door. He could both hear and see he r tension r ising. His naturally protective soul (the essence of being a fine janitor) led him to invite her in. \"W hy don't you come in and sit yerself down. You'se reall y gettin' y erself r iled up right now, Ms. Vera. I'll make us some coffee. Then you ca n figure out what to do. You're sure gonna ge t your spoons back from that profes sor. You gonna whip his ass. B ut not right now. Right now , you nee ds a seat. You've had a ba d day.\" She entered, but they didn't have c offee. The coffee had be en a ruse. Jim was too hard done by to have c offee. He had a small bit of s tretched bourbon. He was nursing that along, a nd he wa sn't about to share it. Indeed, he hoped it w ould not be emptied be fore he got another job. But coffee came with his daughter, and she hadn' t been to see him for a while. \"You be en done ba d by,\" he continued a s she sat down. Jim and she had c ordial relations, but she'd never been inside his apartment. Ve ra knew he had a c at; she could smell it. But she didn't s py the ani mal. \"So wha t 'cha gonna do, Ms. Vera?\" Jim pr obed. \"I'll tell you w hat I want to do. I'd like to take the gun my good ma n Ivan left me when he passed and shoot that pr ofess or.\" \"You got a gun?\" was Jim's s urpris response. \"I sur e do. And a mmunition.\" \"You got a license?\" \"No, I never got one.\" \"You e ver shot s omethin'?\" \"No, but there's got to be a firs t time for everything, you know.\" \"That'd be a rea l bad ide a, Ms. Vera. I mean, y ou don't even see so good, if you don' mind me statin' the trut h.\" \"I know. And lik e that song says, 'Jesus don't like kill in' no matter what the rea son for .' But I sure gotta think a bout it. I mean, I was robbed blind in my own home. I need to protect myself. What would I do out on the st reet if he came up to rob me again?\" \"Now that would be a nasty situation, Ms. Vera.\" \"I need to protect myself.\" \"With a gun? You done said that county l ady a t welfare told you 'bout that professor . Why don't you just call that we lfare lady up on the telephone and tell he r what happene d. She'd lik ely fix him good and ge t yer spoons back. \" And so it came a bout that before the afternoon s chool busses were rolling to pick up the kids from m iddle school, Frances Buss a's phone rang. Sitting in he r office France s was consulting with her young assistant, M argery W hitman. Noting that it wa s a client, she pressed s peake r, and with all the speed that our modern era can muster she was talking to the same Mrs . Veritas Tableau w ho FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI 76First T imers had so resis ted help once upon a long time a go. But today, Mrs . Tableau w as not the docile handica pped clie nt who was speaking to her guardian ang el. No, Vera did not sound like the V era Frances knew a t all. R ather she resembled a ball of fur y, a firework launched to the sky rea dy to explode in a memorable display. And w hen Frances said she would ge t all the spoons back and g et to the bottom of t his affair, Vera only screame d, \"You be tter. Cause I'm calling the c ops. Now.\" And hung up. The chief of Montgomery County Office of Disability Service s was taken aba ck by this most unexpec ted information. Fr ances Bussa hadn' t become a bureau chie f without the ability to push emergenc ies back from the edge. Without batting a n eye , she informed M argery that she would tak e care of the matter, ushered her quickly through the door, and looke d at her watc h. Frances needed to leave . She ha d promis ed the kids that she would be home w hen they g ot home from s chool today. This mess with Vera w ould have to be handle d very quickl y. She w ould str aighten i t out by going directly to her neighbor. Nothing need e scalate. Frances grabbed her coa t and hat, pulle d the gloves from her pockets and tore down to her car. She wa s gone in a flash. Her image of her prof essor ial ne ighbor was morphing at light speed. Once a nee dy, elde rly, recluse, he ha d become a predator of the helpless. How could she have fed this wolf names that he used for larceny. How could this bastard dare to tear down her reputation of fifteen yea rs. Fifteen yea rs as an honest, dece nt, hard working civil servant! How could he? Who the hell doe s he think he is? She was hoping she wouldn't need a lawy er. Hopefully nothing e lse had bee n stolen. She wa s winding through traff ic on the wa y home. A lmost at the beltway. Hopefully he still had the loot. Her Blackberry was ringing inside her purse. She fumbled with the purse as she drove. Frances was neither a c areful nor a safe driver with her attention now totally diverted in three: the phone, the traffic, and the damn ne ighbor. It r ang some more. She ha d it. Someone honke d wildly on her left. She had swerved: almost hit another car. She flicke d the phone on. It was Tableau ag ain. \"I ca lled the polic e. You' d better not be his accomplic e, cause I'm going to have him strung up, and if you're involve d, I'll get you too.\" Table au hung up. Things were unraveling. Frances slowed up, and tried to conce ntrate on the road and the problems, but she couldn't. She pulle d out at Cole sville, and w ound her way to home through the sm all suburban str eets that went up and dow n the hills. Marc's old Chevy w as in the drivewa y. And she coul d see him sitting in the car. She pulled into the drivew ay be hind him, and jumpe d out of the car. Like in the cop movies. She bang ed on the door. He answe red, quite serenely. \" What's the matter,\" he wondered. Wonder is ephemeral and this wonder didn't last long. Frances was a pit bull, not a policew oman. There were no Miranda rights. The rage of betrayal made sure of that. After laying out the charges, and rega ining the spoons, s he announc ed any cordial rela tions between her and this scurr ilous rat that jus t happened most unfort unately to be her neighbor were w ell ove r and done with. \"And di d you steal from anyone e lse, you low scum? No? Well that had be tter be true or believ e me I'll make sure you a ren't ever around aga in to be a preda tor on my county's helpless. A profes sor of ethics? B ull shit! Even Jesus Chris t himself would shun you.\" And yes, he c ould assume that anything he ha d told her would go to the police if Mr s Tablea u's charges were pressed even though the spoons were reposses sed. By the time his neighbor finished delivering her message and stormed off int o her house, the old Professor was deva stated. He wa s as alone as when his mother told him that his f ather wouldn't be coming home from the war. The cente r did not hold. Maybe it neve r did. How he wished for a FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 77First T imers companion, a community, someone to speak to. Someone who would tel l him it would be a ll right. Meliss a. Elsa. Julia. Someone . And now he had burned his bridges with the one live c onnection to his community. That was clea r enough. He wa s alone. And wha t did he have to show for it? He had stolen a few old spoons - a petty theft. He hadn't eve n broken into the acc ounts of that other woman. R uth Dedrick. Unbelie vable bad luck . He had be prema turely. Wha t was he to do? How could he fight bac k? T he fixers on Wall Street had take n awa y his lifetime's earnings. He wouldn't be able to hire a lawy er. He felt adrift like a pie ce of flotsam. In the past, when the currents took him awa y from his moorings, he had saved himself by c linging to some other floating scrap: a student about to fail and now needing suppor t, or a department chair who kne w Marc couldn't del iver research but who neede d the moneys from his grants. Now in this moment of des pair, Marc grieved for his lack of support . Others had a family. His mother and father were dea d. His sis ter too. As he bemoaned his sorr y state, he kne w that there was only one relative le ft whom he could ca ll: his half-brother . This s ibling whom Marc ha d long ago disca rded. Now, at the e nd of his r ope, Marc would ha ve to plea d for help fr om this long spurned relative . And al though Marc at firs t refus ed to admit that he w ould be reduce d to this outreach, he be gan to rehea rse the conve rsation in his mind. Marc searched for phrasing that could preserve his dignity. The task occupied him fully. Nig ht fell on the small house on Tulip Avenue in Takoma Park before he reluctantly picked up the phone to contac t Michael Trowley. After a restless night, he a woke to a nother gray daw n cold enoug h to be on the cusp of snow, but more likely to lea d to one of thos e ice storms Washington residents so hate. Marc felt a strange pounding in his head. He didn't bother tur ning on the radio. Nor did he slip something on over his dirty briefs . He shuffled into the kitchen, now muc h more certainly the ol d beaten ma n than he ha d been only a day earlier. Marc had l eft a phone message a sking Michael to ca ll bac k, but Michael hadn't answered the phone . Nothing yet. He put together some edibles charitably label ed breakfast: burnt toast , bitter boiled coffee, some cheap mixed fruit jelly. W ondering how he w ould fill his day, wa iting for his brother's call, he ate slowly. Strange thoughts ran through his head, \"What is prison food like? Do es a prisoner ge t breakfast? Is it serv ed in th e cell, or in a dini ng hall ? No call. Fuck Michael!\" \"What happens to old prisoners ? Do they get re leased early? Still no call. Wh ere was Michael now that he was needed? Just like him: n ever answers when one of the family call s for help. He didn 't even speak up when we asked what ca used Mom's fall. Ja ke said she ha d slipp ed down the stairs an d Michael stood silent. Ri ght. Slipp ed or pushed ? Ask J ake ab out that one. He'd know. Tell me, Michael! Sh e was yo ur Mom too . You owe me, God damn it. C all.\" But t he phone didn't ring a nd Marc got up and got dressed befor e sitting down aga in with a second cup of coffee at the ki tchen table by the phone. A nd the phone didn't ring. He turned on the radio. One minute w orth of noise and he turned it off. Anger well ed up in him like hot lava pushing to get out. The building press ure was intense. How he ha d been screwe d! And there wa s absolutely no one to he lp. The phone! The phone wa s ringing. Marc grabbe d the offering. His br other was toss ing him a lifeline. \" Hello, Micha el?\" FLOTSAM \"Michae l? I'm not Michael, who eve r he is. T his is M rs. Tableau, you son of a bitch. Exc use me, Jesus. I just wanted to tell you I ca lled the polic e, and I hope they hang y ou from a God damn lamp post. Oh, excuse me Jesus!\" \"Mrs . Tableau, please listen to do t hat?\" \"Mrs . Tableau, please. I ga ve your spoons back to Mr s Bussa. You will ha ve them ag ain. I don't know wha t came ove r me. I didn't mean to steal them.\" \"Like shit you didn't you bastard. Oh Lord J esus, f orgive me. Protect my tongue from evil, dear Lord. You will be going straight down, Profes sor. Yes sir. One hell of a profess or you must have be en. To hell, that's where y ou'll be goi ng.\" \"Mrs . Tableau, please... \" But s he slammed down the rec eiver and Marc w as left in his kitchen, again alone . His heart was pounding. His temples throbbed wors e than ev er. He looked for his blood press ure medicine , but didn't see it in the mess t hat wa s his kitchen. \" Please, Michae l. Please! Just t his once, help me . Please Michae l.\" He w as shouting at the phone - full volume now. \"I'm not s taying he re for t he cops to get me. I am not going to prison. I gotta get out of here. Michael, Michael, please don't ignore me !\" He dial ed Michae l again in New Y ork. No answer. Michael's desperate ha lf-brother left another desperate message. He g rabbed his old jack et and pulle d his keys out of t he pocke t. Storming out of the house, he went into his old Chev y slamming the door on the seat belt's buckle. The violent collision of the door and the car knock ed some slus h and rust of f the fr ame. He turned on the motor, the r adio, a nd the wipers, and sat there. Whe re was he going ? What wa s he going to do? He didn't have a ny idea . But he was getting the hell out of T akoma Pa rk. And fast. Up New Ha mpshir e Ave nue, he turned to get on the Beltwa y, West, then north on 270. And as the traffic thinned he gunned the l ittle car. It vibrated a bit. The whe els weren't properly bala nced. The tires were ba ld. The road was surf aced with the usual wintry mix a nd it slid a bit on the slick. Marc may ha ve bee n desperate, but he wa sn't s uicida l. He slowed up. Thirty miles and he saw a sign for Frederick. Shepherdstown was down the road. He found comfort in that. It gave him a tentative de stination. The notion that perhaps he knew whe re he wa s going calme d him down. His tried once ag ain to identify his options. I n the freezing drizz le, his car wa s cold. The visibility wasn't great. A bi g rig was in front of him, pulling a way from a s top sign. He pulled up a nd stopped. His head throbbed. In front of him, off to the left was a big sign. Like the road, it was all fa miliar, but he had ne ver paid attention to it before. The sign took his breath awa y: SHARPSBURG ARSE NAL! LAST CHANCE ! BEST PRICES IN MARYLAND! GUNS, AMMO, CIVIL WAR MEMORA BILIA! 300 YA RDS ON YOUR LEFT He tried to shake off the pain in his head. His mind tried to focus on the s ign, the promise of guns. It br ought back e arly memories with Elsa, in Turkey. Mag netica lly, he was drawn, first t o the FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 79First T imers left, then down the drive a nd finally, i nto the parking lot. Marc stayed focused on his memories even a s the tension r ose within him and the pa in in his head inc reased. He tried to orient himself by just looking out the windshield. But t he raindrops obfus cated hi s reality. The radio's music was frenetic, some modern piece that bega n to diss olve into noise. He turned on the windshield wipe rs. The press ures f rom his reality w ere magnifie d and transfor med into the throbbing in his head as he wa s getting out of the car. His mind s eemed unde r attack: not only from his out law state, but a lso fr om the press ure building in his head. He felt dizz y and he held onto the door handle of the car to steady himself. But s till he turned and wa lked up to the Arsenal's door. The phone in Marc's kitchen rang. No one a nswered it. It r olled ove r to the answering machine . Michael said, \"We ll, old bro, just got your mes sages, and ca lled right aw ay, but y ou aren't there. Wonde r where you are. Its been so long not hearing from you. And now y ou aren't there. I'll call y ou back i n fifteen minutes. You sound pr etty upset. Tr y to get a g rip. If there's anything I can do, y ou can c ount on me. I'm glad you c alled. It's been far too many y ears.\" In fift een minutes Michael l eft the next message, \"W ell, call me w hen you ge t in.\" During the next ten hours or so, Michael di dn't leave any more messages, but he ca lled ve ry often. Then he calle d the State . FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 80CHAPTER 14: SINKING Gene Austermann did not cha nge out of his US Park Range r unifor m when he l eft his job as night watc hman at Ha rper's Ferry. He had put his sidearm and his hols ter, along wi th his hat, in his locker at he adquarters. For someone in security, trained to use a gun, to dea l with medic al emergenc ies, to handle a car in dang erous on and off r oad cha ses, his was the ea siest of jobs. Five nights a wee k in the bac k country of West Virginia, Ge ne patrolled the de serted s treets of the histor ical site in a conve rted electric golf ca rt. T he worst that ever happened ha d occurred late one warm autumn night. A bea r stood its gr ound on the road. It hadn't been frightened by the quiet golf ca rt. When Gene honke d, the bea r was attracted by the hig h pitched 'BEE P BEEP' of the horn. Gene was scared as the bear amble d closer to the golf cart. He knew one shouldn't run f rom a bear. And e ven if he turned the cart around and floored it, the bea r could easily be at the ca rt. He also knew that a s a park ranger he coul dn't shoot t he bea r and keep his job. Without hesitation Gene did the next best thing. He threw the bea r his last Payday candy bar. Thus distr acting the bear with pea nuts and caramel, Ge ne wa s able to hightail i t (at about 15 mph) to the headqua rters' building a nd lock himself inside. The bear hung a round long enough for Gene to take a snooze. In the morning the bear had gone and Gene did one more patrol of the park. Whe n he arrived bac k at hea dquarters he was happy to see the next gua rd ready to relieve hi m. When she asked if there were a ny notable events on his watch he didn' t identify any. Gene made no entry in the event log . But the next night when Murphy Longst reet, the guard for weeke nd nights, took his rounds , the bea r was more aggressive. And Murphy, a part timer with less t raining, wa sn't in the habit of carrying a candy bar. The shooting of t he bea r was in all the loc al new spapers. I t got a big play on a local PETA website. Murphy lost his job. But everyone else w ould know \"nothing e ver happene d\" on Gene's wa tch. This morning he was looking forward to getting ba ck to his cozy double -wide home in the Sharpsburg woods. He'd make himself an omele t and, if he could c atch a n early slee p, he would g et a start on his taxes before going ba ck to work. Gene e xited the Park's headqua rters and took a sip of chicken soup from his thermos . Wa lking to his Jeep he didn't look forward to scraping the thin film of ice from its windshield. R anger Auster mann could not know that he wa s well on his way toward his fir st heroic act as a security gua rd, even if it was to occur off duty. Gene pulle d out of the employee pa rking lot and hea ded Ea st into M aryland a nd then North to Maryland 34. W ith icy roads he wa s not r ushing home, and whe n he got to the old Arsenal's sign he glanc ed as he a lways did toward the parking lot on his left. The beat up Chev y in the lot ca ught his eye but it wasn't until he had driven a bout half a mile further down the road that it registered that he had seen ex haust coming out of the tail pipe a nd wipers on in the car. He c hecke d his watch. Wedne sday, 10:15. No way anyone should be in the lot today: the store was closed. So Gene turned his Jeep around and made i t back to the lot. Pulling next to the old C avalier, Gene c ould see for certain that something was wrong. The windows were steame d up, wipers on, motor r unning. Gene honked but got no respons e. He g ot out of the Jeep and knocke d on the window of the be at-up Chevy . An elde rly man wa s slumped over the whee l, motionless, wedged in a n awkw ard position against the driver's door . The old man's only response to the knocking wa s an awkw ard twitch. Gene went over to the passenger side, FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 81Sinking smashed the window and g ained e ntrance. The old driver was unshaven, twi tching, a nd mouthing some unintelligible guttural sounds but otherwise quite unrespons ive. Gene turned off the motor and, pulling out his cell, ca lled for an ambula nce. ******** Earlie r, Marc had stared at the wea thered plastic sign with the bold lettering ne xt to the door. He wa s shocked to find that he c ouldn't deciphe r the meaning of the sign whic h to others clearly stated, \"Sharpsburg Ars enal: Guns, Civil W ar Memorobilia. Prices be ertainly this was str ange. Something wa s dreadfully wrong. Those very linear squiggles on the plastic were c arefully printed to communica te something. He knew that. He knew that he wa s being cal led on to read, but for som e reason, he coul dn't. He tried the door, but it didn't open. As he turned, frus trated to go toward the car, he w as sur prised that his right leg didn't wa nt to facilitate hi s rotation. Rather quickly, Marc's perception of reality was cha nging into something very new , very threatening. His body seemed to de tach from his mind. He found it increasingly difficult to summon t he will to get his arms and leg s to help him move toward his car. Whe n he had g one the few ya rds to the car, he w orked hard to recall w hat he wa s doing in this place. W hat had he planned to do, now that he wa s back in the ca r? With tremendous effor t he forced himself to r emember that this was not where he wa s to s tay. The ca r would get him to a pla ce where he coul d get help. But only a He rculean e ffort over many minutes allow ed him to get the ke y in the loc k and to turn on the motor. The task exhausted him, and he slumped a gainst the door. In this state, he bega n inadve rtently to recapture early me mories. He relived his father leaving for war. And then the entrance of his stepfather in his life. Then thought seemed to leav e him. Time oozed by until he ca me to hear a knocking somewhe re in his environment. Why w ould someone knock so persis tently? What ev er it was, the knocke r didn't seem threatening a nd so M arc conc luded that he w as to greet the intruder. He tried to s ay something friendly but his own unintelligible utterings f rightened him. And w hat were these loud sounds coming from this stranger's face? Marc ca me to realize that his mind was slipping toward uncontrolled dissolution. The ambulanc e took Marc to the ER at the Seve nth Day Adve ntist hos pital in Gai thersbur g. Gene a nd the crew ha d gotten Marc's wallet out of his pocket before plac ing him on the ambulanc e's gurney. And a lthough all the i dentifying a nd insurance information was in the wa llet, the admission s taff accosted Marc with a bunc h of questions before admitting him as a stroke patient. To M arc, al l this activity appe ared purposeless . People we re loudly dema nding many things of him. Words were being thrown a t him and his mind was having i ncreasing trouble fending off their rude sounds . In his f ragile mind, the torrent of words cr ashed like brick s through window panes. They appea red as aggressive actions without intelligi ble purpose. When a sked his name he tried to give it. He aring his own unintellig ible response so t errified him that he vowed not to utter any further sounds . He wa s rushed fr om one room to another, fr om one big mac hine to another. Blood was taken from him, t ubes insert ed. He c ould make no sense of this. B ut he did come to bel ieve tha t these people w ere trying to help him. At e ach ne w turn, there were new faces demandi ng new thing s, not FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 82Sinking waiting for t he answers he couldn't, a nd wouldn't give . Time seemed to move eve r so slowly. Finally, he fell into a long slee p. ******** In New Roc helle, not far fr om the str eets mentioned in R agtime, Micha el Trowley ha d eaten hi s dinner in silence w ith his thir d wife, Mary: a pretty blonde almost thirty years his junior . He sat, as was the custom of his father Jake, at the he ad of the table, in an a rmed dining cha ir. She sat at the foot of t he table , closer to the door to t he kitche n on a slightly le ss formal chair. His daily desire for meat conflicted w ith her natural predilection for vege tables and her expressed compassion f or the fate of cows. Not that the citified Mary had eve r petted a live c ow. But f rom the many hea rings of Ella Jenkins s inging Did Y ou Milk the Cow in her Manhattan living room, Mary had absorbed an empathy for this beatific mammal a nd her other domest icated brethren. Michael, on the other hand, had divorced tw o other shapely damsels for less annoying traits t han her mea tless cuis ine. But tonight domestic s pats gave w ay to the far we ightier question of fraternal obligations. Mary had neve r met Marc, and had hea rd very little about him until Michae l had ca lled her from his off ice to inform her of M arc's two desperate messages on his of fice's answering mac hine. From her point of view, as the potential privileged i nheritor of the Trowley fortune, the sudden intr usion of what sounded like a very nee dy sibling wa s not a posit ive dev elopment. Micha el, on the other hand, wa s affected by the ca lls in a different direction. \"Wha t did you do about those two phone ca lls you got from your half-brother? \" Mary now inquired. Michae l heard a strongly self-interest ed and de fensive tone in the question. He had be en feeling regrets all da y. W ithout children of his own, Marc was the only relative he had le ft. He looked a round at the dining room, where he ha d eaten so many meals. He reca lled sitting here with his parents and his t wo siblings, Meliss a, and Marc. Time oozed through the space a nd formed a barrier between the two Trowley s. Mary waited and the n asked ag ain, \"Did y ou reach Marc?\" \"I calle d a few times, but no one pic ked up. Finall y, I got upset enough to call the Maryland police, but last I heard, they knew nothing. They'll ca ll once the y know his whe reabouts.\" \"How do you fee l about those calls? I mean you neve r really talke d about Marc.\" \"Yeah, I know. I've be en remembering him sitting right here, around this table. In my memory he wa s so often angry and in trouble w ith Father. They never really got along. That's why I have the house, and the business. Somehow, today, I reali zed how upset Marc mus t be to have c alled. I mean, e ven whe n Meliss a died he didn't call . Imagine, he was so angry that he ha d the funeral home call me to announce my own sister's death. I ca n't get over it. I can't understand it.\" \"It sounds like you don't owe him anything. \" \"Maybe. But t hat's so s implistic. I am upset about the relationship. It wasn't because of me or something I had done: it was Dad a nd Marc who neve r got along. Still I feel gui lty. I can't do anything a bout Marc's memor ies of his father or my Dad. C ertainly, the ol d man wa sn't easy. Mom and we kids took a lot of beatings from him. I didn't like him either. But I didn't know any other household. Marc and Melissa must have be en comple tely a lienated. But they didn't confide in me. They kept to themselves. I was out there all alone .\" \"Well, the only story I know about him, is when he a nd Meliss a left you w hen your mother had been ba dly bea ten by your father. You reca ll that you beg ged Marc to take y ou with him.\" FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 83Sinking \"Right. Sort of . Marc was pretty shor t change d. Look. I got everything. The business , the house, even the fucki ng dining room table. A nd what did Marc or Melissa get? Not hing.\" For a few minutes s ilence reigned a round the big table. Then Micha el continue d. \"Actua lly, the thing a bout Meliss a was much wors e. She ha d come home to hel p after Mom died. She helped raise me. For years, s he wa s the main adult in my life. She pai d a terrible cost for this. Dad's violence, a nd the loss of much of her youth. I was worried sick about Meliss a's anorexia . Later, for years, I begge d her to go for t reatment. And then, w hen Marc realiz ed she was going to die of anorexi a, he di dn't tell me. I didn't know.\" \"Looks to me that you don't owe the bastard anything .\" \"That's pr etty one-sided. He is my half-brother. T he only rel I have left. And he is begg ing me for help.\" Michael l ooked at his wa tch. \"I'm worried. Marc hasn't called me back, and I have he ard diddly from the police. I guess I'll call once more before it's too late. Then let's go to bed. In the worst case, we'll ha ve to see wha t happens in the morning.\" Breakfa st was never a time for s haring. W hat with Michae l in his blue suit, st riped tie, rushing down his black c offee and bag el, wi th the Jour nal's Markets s ection spread in front of him and keys to the Jag in his hand. Michae l's head wa s already invol ved in the problems of the day a nd the commute. Hea ven forbid that something alter that schedule - such as misplaced key s or a dela yed paper deliv ery. And these day s it didn't take any outside al teration to create problems. The problems of the market drops had crashed down on Michael' s small business like an av alanche. There wa s no indica tion that things were going to get be tter. Michael knew that in this climate, there wa s no market for his business . No one would buy it. Surely, no bookie would bet ev en on his firm's survival. The downward thrust of the market was digging the grave of his clients and his firm prematurely. Luckily it was a grave he wa s sure he had a voided. Way before the opening bell a nd the market's firs t moments, phones were ringing. C ustomer s were worried and not e ager to hear him say \"try to hold the course\" another time. By lunch time he was worn out. He told his secretary to hold all ca lls - he was going out for lunch and a drink. But no s ooner had he put down the phone when it rang a gain. Hi s secretary, w ho had in his mind, most unf ortunately ag ed over the ye ars, apologize d, \"It's t he Maryland Sta te Police.\" Michael sat down he avily, and took the ca ll. His brother had been admitted to some Adventist hospital in Gaithersburg with a str oke. He took this in slowly, a nd then quietly hung up. He exhal ed and thought ba ck to all those day s as a child, al l those days he had w anted to have a big brother or sister who would protect him from the violence a t home and do things with him. These longings were too old to be fulfilled, but the communica tions r egarding Marc's dis tress had reaw akene d them. His mind tur ned to his sis ter. Almost a quarter century ago Marc hadn't bothered to tell him about his sis ter's death. So much - on top of that fir st abandonment. Still there lay the long dormant hope for a tie to his big brother. T his brot her who had the c ourage to stand up to his brutal father. The brot her who lifted his sis ter out of t he room of violence. The brother who Michael had a lways hoped would shelter him fr om the stor m. But t he hopes were ne ver realize d. Picking up the phone had rekindle d the memory of that other phone call announcing Meliss a's death. He could hea r the indifferent voice of the director of FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 84Sinking the Colli ns Funer al Home g reeting him M aryland A nd then intoning \"Y our brot her Marc has asked me to extend my condolenc es for the passing of your s ister, M elissa.\" The message had driven his anger to a pitch theretofore not known. Michae l took it for what it was: an ugly effort by Marc to push him out of the family. Melissa had dropped dea d, emac iated, on a n elliptica l trainer at a gym when she wa s with Marc. Heart attack. His sister . Now, his brother: incapaci tated with a stroke. Al l these thoughts r ushed through and then a sudden sens e of great loneli ness, s adness, and self-pity. Placing his elbow s on his large oa k desk and cradling his hea d in his large hands he cl osed his eyes. After a period, he rega ined some equilibrium and tried to think through the situation. Marc had called for him to r econne ct - to rejoin the family to help hi m get out of som e jam. Perhaps Michae l should be generous. The loss es couldn't be helpe d. His family history was set. B ut the futur e, that might be Michae l's to s hape. Pulling himself together was what Micha el wa s best at. It had support ed his success in bus iness and now le d him to plan a response to his br other's calls for help. He a sked his s ecretary to ca ll to inform M ary of the details. Late Thursday night found Michael in a Holiday Inn Express near the hospital. His s ecretary ha d set up meetings with the attending ne urologist and nurs e of the str oke section of the hospital. Befor e Friday noon, Marc wa s staring into another str anger's face. But ins tead of being a ccosted once a gain by impatienc e and y elling, he wa s happy to experienc e a soft warmth, and a w elcoming voice. The voice w as encouraging Marc to believe that this man was different. Rather than just screaming words to communicate the impossible, this man had give n him a long hug and a k iss on his cheek. Marc found the man holdi ng his hand, and e ven massaging it. It gave Marc comfort, and hope. Marc felt that this was a friend he could trust. After piecing some hints and faci al express ions together, Marc believ ed that this man would come again to love, to help him. Michael l et Marc sleep, and ta lked to the nurses t o figure out what neede d to be done. W hen Marc woke from his nap, there he wa s: this same eleg ant man, in a blue dress s hirt, wearing a striped tie. Only e arly on Monday did Micha el lea ve. And the n he left so early as to be abl e to arrive directly a t his of fice in time for the market opening. E ven during those firs t days Michael ha d seen improvement. Physiotherapists had dema nded that Marc wa lk, albe it with a wa lker, and only a very few steps. M arc, though unabl e to talk, seeme d to be regaining the recognition of some words, and with them, perhaps, some acc ess to memory. But how, and eve n where, Marc woul d sur vive w as difficult to pin down. Michael took these da ys as if they were give n to him by Providence. It was to be his opportunity to repair the dozens of years of mis understandings that had passed between the two brothers. ******** Everyone who drives regularly on that grea t eastern highway , I-95, can give witness to Maryland's state mottos and slogans. For years \"Maryland: More Than You Ca n Imagine\" a dorned the signs welcoming drivers fr om Delaw are. But since, over time, the imag inations of Americans were inc reasingly impa ired, the implica tions of the slogan bega n to diminish in import ance. Indeed, eventua lly, the sloga n implied nothing. So in February, 2007, Gove rnor Ehrlich took it upon hims elf to replace the broken slogan. Not an intelle ctual fly-we ight, Ehrlich kne w that to raise Maryland's rank as a tourist des tination the slogan wa s mor e manipula ble than the Sta te's lack of gorges, gla ciers, volcanoe s and ) PAGE - 85Sinking sand beac hes. So he authored the slogan's cha nge to \"Se ize the Da y off - Maryland.\" Although Maryland is sur rounded by hordes of people, the expe cted bulge in touris m never deve loped. The empty hotel rooms in the grand destinations of Baltimore, Rockvi lle and Landover caused by such ineffective sloga neering, w ere understood to be a political threa t by the reigning poli ticos. Indeed, eventua lly, fac ed with such poor wordsmans hip, the voters of t he great state kic ked Governor Ehrlich out of office. They replac ed him by w hat could only be hoped to be a more talented man of words: M artin O'Malley. O'Mal ley w as a renowned pol icy w onk. Eve ryone expe cted the new governor could author phrases t o bait Maryland's renowned tourist tr aps and ca pture the touris t dollars of Americana. But at the very hour the governor was draft ing his propos al to replac e the brilliant officia l motto of the st ate (Fatti Maschii, Parole Femine - or loosely translated: \"Manly Deeds, Woma nly W ords\"), John Doe, the State Director of Senior Services Planning a nd Budgeting entered the Governor's office in Anna polis with a dire wa rning. Budget cuts br ought about by the e conomic dow nturn were projected to hurt many seniors, and this could hav e horrible political consequence s. Being quick w itted, the Governor recognized this immedia te crisis r equired his attention. In light of the recession, the rewording of the st ate motto and slogans had to be postponed. The Governor put aside his pen and lega l pad, a nd questioned his director of services. To the Governor 's horr or, this bureaucrat had not y et devel oped a rea dy solution to deal with the problems he was reporting upon. Time weighed he avily, and no a mount of their br ain storming seemed to cla rify plausible alternative policy i mplications. Finally , after what the Governor's log shows t o be more than 12 minutes of discuss ion, O'Malley choose a course of action: He would find a new director. The hapless bur eaucrat, John Doe, would be sacke d. Fortunately, John Doe had convenie ntly discovered a ne ed to spend more time with his family and sacki ng wa s unnecessary. In what appea red to be another far removed universe, on that same gray morning of February 19, 2009 France s entered the County W elfare Depa rtment. She folded her umbrella and knoc ked her feet on the mat to loosen the slus h she picked up in the pa rking lot. She wa s in a rus h to get to her desk. Frances was determined to put down in writing her understanding of Vera Tablea u's complaint. Further she planned to speak to a la wyer in the legal division about poss ible a ctions that might have to be taken. But in the r eal w orld where cha os reigns and the w ings of butt erflies can affect the c ourse of revolutions, an unexpec ted telephone call from Annapolis came. It chang ed both the ca reer trajectory of Frances Bus sa and the fate of Marc Buttervogel. Needle ss to say, with the grea t excite ment of being plucke d out of the drab job of a high ranking county bureaucrat, Frances put aside pressing matters . Inst ead of writing down a complaint, she considered he r obligation to recommend Margery Whi tman for a promot ion as her temporary replaceme nt. Word processor s in both Annapolis and Roc kville w ere quickly employe d to write the requisite memos. Pr ess conferences were planne d to mark the eleva tion of Fr ances Bussa to the post of Director of Senior Services Planning and Budgeting.

Soon to be on her fabulous new business card, complete with a n embossed illust ration of the st ate seal a nd motto. She was on her way . FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI ) PAGE Marc's condition s tabilize d, the contours of his newly reduce d self clarified for the doctors , nurses, and Michae l. All c ould see how much ha d been lost. Along w ith his general motor disabilities, Marc maintaine d an al most complete inability to c ommunicate. One wet a nd cold afternoon in late winter, Michae l tried to gain ac cess to 104 Tulip. He was testing the windows to find a non-destr uctive pa th of entry. Michael wa s seeking information to identify his brother as sets. Dress ed, as usual, in his New Y ork navy blue pin str ipes, tie and Gucc i shoes, with his r ented new red Cadi llac in the drivewa y, he w as a conspicuous sight for the young members of t he Buss a family as they arrived home in thei r van. \"Look Mom, there's a dog thief, going to break into Profess or Marconi's window!\" \"You mea n Christopher. \"I am not dumb.\" \"Are too. Any how, he isn't Marconi.\" Frances firs t glance d in the bac k to ascertain that the kids were still belted in, and not on the verge of an e ra of war. She then looke d toward the neighbor's house as she tur ned in her drivewa y. Instinctively , she interrupt ed the burgler: \"Hey , you! Just what do you think you a re doing over there?\" she hollered out of her window toward the pin striped burglar. Embarrass ed by the sudden attention, Michae l turned around a bit too quickly a nd felt his left jacket sleeve catch, and then rip, on a protruding object. \"Hi! I'm Marc's br other, Michael. This must look suspicious but its innocent. Your neighbor, Marc, has had a stroke. He is in the hospital up in Gaithersburg. I am tr ying to ge t inside to get some papers and things for him, but don't have a key.\" Thus bega n Michael' s intr oduction to the neighborhood super hero. \"So, that's where he' s been! We haven' t seen him for awhile. I had no ide a wha t had happe ned. I have a k ey, so you won' t need to break in a nd cause someone, lik e me, to ca ll the police .\" After parking the va n and ge tting the kids out, Fr ances turned to deal with this allege d brother. \"You have some ID, don't you?\" Frances said cooly. Inwa rdly, she was trying to recall if she had a ctually filed a memo a bout Vera's complaint. Marc's viola tion of her tr ust was fr esh. s till rankled. \"Sure, here's my driver's license.\" \"New Y ork: Michael Trowley. Not the na me I might have e xpected. Can you do better than this? Perhaps you have some detai ls to give me or another ID? \" \"Actua lly, I'm Marc's half-brot her. He kept his father's name: Buttervogel. I got the name of my father.

Just wait out here, and one of the kids will bring it out. Christopher ! Sarah! Let's get inside now!\" But t he last excla mation wa sn't r eceived by the intended a udience . The kids were running around the front FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 87Cat Burglar yard play ing tag: the ir school bags and papers now str ewn ove r the muddy yard. \"Hey , Christopher, Sarah! Grab your things! Pick up those papers! You are going inside! Now! And scrape off the mud on your shoes !\" Soon, under the wa tchful eye of Frances, C hristopher had hande d the pin striped man the k ey. Now gai ning ea sy entry, with only a torn s uit to show for his effor ts, M ichae l walked into the darkened house. The wa rmth of the interior was testament to the r obotics of the therm ostat. He picked up the pile of mail tha t had ac cumulated unde r the mail slot and turned on a hall li ght. Moving now down the ha ll with his stash of mail, he found himself at the kitchen. In the corner was a small table with one cha ir. Bot h were pa inted many time s, and both were chippe d so one could see their many ge nerations of f inish. He put the mail on the tabl e and sat down. Micha el beg an by moving a dirty coffee c up and a ha lf emptied cerea l bowl to the side. Thickening layers of grayish- green and pi nkish molds were growing on the surf aces of t he coffee a nd a ca rbohydrate that might have onc e bee n shr edded w heat. Turning his attention to the mail he w as still clutching in one ha nd, Michael bega n separating out the junk. The junk pile grew steadily . But ther e were a few ke epers: a bank statement, a credit card bill, and a n envelope from a \"Julia Bur nham Lambert, Financia l Advisor, Suite 406 The rett Building, Silver Spring.\" Nothing pe rsonal. Openi ng the bills and ba statement, he bega n to comprehend his brother's financia l situation. The exploratory moves revealed e vidence of a ship wreck: a n elec tric bill with January c harges of $136 but which w ith unpaid bal ances and fees, totaled $385. A similar gas bill. And the mortgage . The total was astounding. Large debts, limited ca sh in his checking account and virtually no saving s. Were finance s what he had c alled about that morning in February? B ut then, what wa s he doing in the parking lot of a g un shop mor e than 60 mile s away? Suicide? Michae l had no other clue s, but s uicide di dn't fit his understanding of his br other's charac ter. Perhaps he could get some information fr om the neighbor. He'd g o over and return the key. Turning on the porch light a nd leav ing the front door unlocked, Michael w alked across t he drive to the neighbor's house. When C hristopher answered, Michae l asked to see his mother. And soon an apparently over-tasked, impatient, and ha rassed lady came to the door. As she opened the storm door, he handed he r the key and be gan w hat he thought might be a neighborly c onversation. \"Thanks s o much, Mrs . . . name.\" \"Frances Bus sa\" \"The key rea lly hel ped. Probably saved me a tea r in my slacks. Would you l ike it bac k, or can I keep it for awhile ?\" \"No, I don't want it. kee p it,\" she retort ed with a ggrava tion and bega n to close the door. \"Can I just ask you for one more favor? \" But noting that s he wa s aggravate d, and nee ding an answer, he continue d, \"Marc hadn't ca lled me for yea rs. Then suddenly, a c ouple of wee ks ago, he called me two or more times in the space of an hour. Ea ch time he w as sounding increasingly desperate. Whe n I called hi m back, he wasn't there. Now that he ha s had this s troke he can' t communica te. Do you hav e any idea w hat wa s going on? I s there anything you c an tell me , that would let me he lp him?\" \"Mr. T rowley, I am not going to get involved, \" she bega n now showing an a nimosity that he had not previously witnessed. \"Your brother and I had a very serious f alling out.

He stole some silver f rom an elderly, bli nd lady who had be en a c lient of the County office for senior s ervices. I was the county socia l worker in charge a nd he did it all at my expe nse. Maybe he di d it out of desper ation. But he cross ed a bridge of no retur n with me. My beli ef? When a dog bites the hand that feeds it, it is time to put t he dog down. I won't be involv ed further with that br other of yours .\" And she forcefully cl osed door. Turning towards Marc's abandoned home, Micha el beg an to understand the gravitas of thos e phone calls. Reentering his brot her's home, he turned on more lights. Was his br other now a common thief? He sat down and tried to square his memories with his brother's suppos ed status. Not hing seemed to fit. His brother had heroically swooped up Melissa, had led a nti-war and other political activists. In Michael's mind, his brot her was an established a ctivist. And now a thie f? It didn't add up. Michael l ooked around. W hat could he discover to uncover the true nature of Michael by examini ng his burr ow? He got up and we nt into the hall. The once light beige paint wa s now spott ily da rkened by dirt. It was lit by a single, l ow wa ttage ba re light bulb in a c eiling fixture. A few feet down the ha ll, toward the ba ck bathroom and kitche n, under a discolored and c racked ple xiglass cover we re some old photos mounted on paper, pasted on some particle boa rd. The whole thing was jerry-built but there they were: Marc's photo album. Michael' s eye ca me to rest on a black a nd white, formal shot of his mother with the three kids. Mom was sit ting on a big uphol stered chair in some photography studio. She looked older than Michael reme mbered. Her hair wa s up in a bouffant that he could not recall seeing. A flow er was in her hair. She wa s wearing a bl ouse with an ela sticized nec k that had bee n pulled down ov er one shoulder. Michael w as on his mother 's knee with bulgi ng pants over his diapers. He looked may be one and a ha lf or a bit older. His puf fed up face reve aled the fit or cr y he must have ha d just pr ior to the snap of the camera. To the left stood M elissa, perhaps nine yea rs old. She w as wea ring a polka dotted dress and wa s the only child who a ppeared to be ha ppy. Looking a t her, Michael rea lized suddenly that he ha d no memories of how s he looked be fore the onslaught of her anorexia. Here she looked we ll fed. He didn't dig est the feelings under this obs ervation, but rather kept scanning the picture. And there w as a much olde r Marc was st anding off to the left, pouting, and uncomfortable. He wa s wearing an obv iously over-st arched shirt. Marc was resis ting any friendly facial expression beneath wha t can only politely be called a me ssy growth of hair. Next to the firs t picture was a col or enlargement of Melissa and Marc. This phot o resonated: Michael ha dn't ever seen a pic ture of his sister as he remembered her at the funeral. Here Melissa was wea ring jeans and a sweat shirt and her face appe ared horribly thin. But s he wa s smiling broadly. Marc has his arm around her waist. Meliss a was so emac iated that Marc's arm looked bloated. They a re in front of a university library. To one side there is a big bronze turtle. Michael leans bac k aga inst the wall behind hi m for s upport and sinks into a vortex of memories s ettling on the image of his emaciated sister in her casket. He reca lls the horr or of hearing the voice of the funeral director, \"Your brother asked me to call y ou to tell you that your sister , Melissa B uttervogel has passed. The funer al will be tomorrow.\" Meliss a, who ha d taken c are of him after his mot her had died. Why di dn't Marc let him know that Melissa was in dange r? How could Marc ha ve let this stranger relate the news? How could he ha ve done this to his own brother ? These questions which he has so often asked himself r esurf aced as he stood in fr ont of the pictures. FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 89Cat Burglar Michael c oped by standing up straight, and buttoning his Br ooks B rother's suit jacket. He readjusted his tie. The costume, even with its now flawe d cuff, gives him the str ength of status . The problems here, no matter how close they cut to the bone, a re histor ical - no longer his. His br other may ha ve pick ed up Melissa and ca rried her to s afety, a nd Michael ma y have often had to face the terror s alone, but he wa s strengthened by these ordeal s. He turned back to the photos. The next picture showed an e arly pre-marital scene w ith a happy Elsa and Marc. They were in front of a mosque, somewhere. Then comes a picture of a he ad shot of a bearded and l ong haired Marc with a sexy y oung blonde in a mirror . The mirr or has a dark frame, but the picture is of a very messy bedroom, f illed by the bed. Lingerie a nd underpants lie helter-skelter on the bed. Marc and the blonde look ve ry happy - indee d, like they had just both come and a ren't dress ed ye t. The picture cele brates the occasion. Michae l looked a t the blonde, and the n back a t his s ister. T he memories brought f orth by the picture galle ry exhausted Michae l and he turned a way. Once a gain a t the kitchen table , Michael turned over the financial advisor's unopened envelope . The retur n address, embos sed in golden ink a nd a nea t 'script' f ont, invoked a sense of r iches. He didn't really w ant to see what w as inside, knowing w hat it would revea l; it would reflect the rea lized nightmares of s o many of his own customers . Just holding it brought back the ma ny ang ry calls from t he suckers who had stayed w ith the market. The vast majority never sold shor t, never understood it to be a house of cards until too late. Wha t would he ha ve told his brother, had Marc been his clie nt? M ichae l hoped he w ould have told him to get out in late 2007 , when Micha el did. But M ichae l had told none of his clients to sell. And so, Michael sat there, wonde ring about his good fortune: his t ens of millions, his fancy c ars, his s ummer house, his yacht. It was a familiar list. But at that moment, not one that comfor ted him. Michael ope ned the enve lope, a nd noted the portfolio - one that mus t have e xperience d total devastation. He refolded the statement, and put it in the vest pocket of his tor n jack et. Going upstairs into Marc's bedroom he found M arc's laptop on a small tabl e. Next to it there sat an almost full box of busines s cards. Under the box was a purple note book. Micha el took out one of the business cards. It was attr active , with a li ttle red logo of a fancy script \" Dr. I. T .\" and there w as \"Marc Butter vogel, PhD.\" Michael' s mind went back to the non-sequitur: \"What de speration could have led Marc to steal from a blind woman?\" No answer appea red. Michael ope ned the la ptop. After its boot-up it asked for a pass word. Michael tried a couple: Marc's birthday, E lsa, some combinations of birt hdays and names and phone numbe rs, but they didn't work. So he put it down a nd sitting on the s ide of the bed, he pic ked up the purple note book. While reaching for t he note book, Micha el notice d the full length mirror. Showing its age the mirror 's silver had de veloped c racks and wrinkles. Its patina synchronizing with the a ging of the humans it reflected. Tucked into its fr ame w ere a c ouple of small sepia pictures. One wa s recogniza ble: Marc's father. Another: Michael' s father and mother. M arc's father looks younger, and happi er than Michael remembered him from other photos. He was wea ring a military uniform, but casually , with an ope n colla r. The s econd photo has Michae l's parents s tanding in front of a hay stack. An unfamilia r barn is of f to the left. T he whole composition is s trange and Micha el gets up to take a c loser look. Wondering whe n it was taken, he pulled it out from the mir ror frame but when he did so, a corner tears off , making the picture look still older. Tur ning it over, he noted the date, 194 6, and the inscription \"For my new chi ldren, with love, Jake.\" The photo signale d the formation of t he new family. Micha el wa s not yet a member. FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 90Cat Burglar Michael slipped the picture in his shir t pocket and e xamined the notebook. Frances Bus sa's contact information face d him on the firs t page.

Just below that information, Marc had tape d a copy of his bus iness card and put a title to the book: \"IT work.\" Two other pages followed with writing on them.

But following this there was no acc ounting of services and charges. But there again w as the note: \"See d:\\AUC H.DOC.\" The other pages were bla nk. Michae l took out the photo of his father and looked a t it again. He slipped the photo of his f ather into the notebook and took a nother look around the room. On a small shelf to the r ight of the mirr or lay a few old paperbac ks in a varied state of disintegration: The Tin Dr um, with some pages cle arly slipping out of the binding, two library books \"C omputers for Dummies,\" and a nota bly used thin volume, \"The Ove rcoat and Other Stories\" by Gogol. Michae l opened the li brary books. T hey w ere long ove rdue, and Michae l took them, the notebook, a nd the computer in his hand. Loading his loot in the Ca dillac , he drove off to his hot el, hoping tha t the sterility of t he hotel room would be a comforting contrast to the disquieting mementoes of the house. But s leep did not c ome ea sily. The images of his family remained w ith him during the night, causing him to toss about. He a woke e very few hours to find hims elf filled with a nxiety. Fina lly he fell into a long y et fitful s leep. But then he wa s visit ed by a nightmare dormant since childhood. He is a young boy, sitting in a corner of the room witnessing a ferocious fight. His f ather has knocked down his mother and his s ister. T hey a re being pummele d when his much older brother enters. Heroicall y, Marc stands up to his father and stops the fight. Then Marc picks up his s ister f rom the floor and is about to leav e the apa rtment. M ichae l finds himself s uddenly w ithout voice. He screams yet is unheard and is abandone d in the corner alone i n the apa rtment with his m other. Michael's attention is on the front door . He hea rs a key turn the lock. Now he is in a house. His mother is at the hea d of st airs. His f ather comes at her with a ba t in his hand. He starts to beat his mother and then pushes his mother down the stairs and turns t o face Micha el in the c orner. Michael wa its for Marc to r eenter, to come a nd get him but he neve r does. And Michae l is now alone, small and defensele ss. Jake a pproaches him now in fury. Try as he may , Michael is unable to move, una ble to scream. Then he wa kes. Michael a woke c overed in swea t. He sat up and swung his feet to the floor. He recalled the dream and in its many vi sitations and variations. In t hem, his father alwa ys is hitt ing someone in the family, but neve r hits Michael. Different people are hurt in different dr eams. His father is always dress ed in a pi n striped suit and a tie. Michael tries to crawl into a corner to be left alone. But as the violenc e grows, he begs Marc for pr otection. But in these dreams, M ichae l can ne ver vocal ize and Marc never eve n notices him. No one ca n hear him: Marc alw ays picks up Melissa in his arms and leaves for safety. Michael is left alone in the room. Sometimes his father tur ns into a wild anima l. And then trying to scream, Michae l wak es up agai n and ag ain. FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 91Cat Burglar Michael l ay ba ck down a nd slept till dawn. W hen the sun came up hi dden behind c louds, Michael returned to Marc's house. Walking back dow n the hall, he looked a t neither the image s of his sister, nor his mother. B ut on his way to the kitche n he did look a gain a t the blonde. W ere she more than a photo, he ima gined that she would ha ve returned his glance with an invi ting wink. The imagine d come on ca used his f irst smile of the day. In the refrigerator he found coff ee, threw out some very limp broccoli a nd some moldy cut tomatoes. There was a bad odor in the mea t drawer, and so he searched for garbage bags. Whe n he found them, he dumped a ll the spoiled contents of the refrigerator. After these domestic chores, he clea ned up the room a bit, and brew ed the coffee. But even with plenty of ca ffeine, without more clues, Michae l couldn't identify a n easy wa y to patch things together to get an understanding of his br other. His mind moved to the problem at hand. W hat wa s to be done to suppor t Marc? O f cours e, he could just set up an account w ith his own money. But what loca l would look a fter M arc's everyda y affairs? Carrying his cup of coff ee, he wande red into the living room, and looke d around. No real library. Not much sign of a lifetime in ac ademe . Noticing a wall clock, he wa s surpris ed to see it was alrea dy after 9:30. The la teness of the hour gave him a jolt and led hi m to plan his day. He would undertake two minor tasks before going bac k to the hospital: return t he books to the Takoma Park library and get a n appointment with Julia Lambe rt to develop a financ ial pla n with Ms. L ambert to suppor t Marc's pos t-stroke living. Then, hopefully tonight, he would return for a few days to New R ochelle . FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 92CHAPTER 16: AND TAKING A bright and wa rming late winte r sun brought s ome relief from the depress ing gray da mpness that often hangs over Washington's Februaries. And during just s uch a sunny moment Michae l walked past pawn shops, small ethnic groceries and e ateries and into the lobby of The Eve rett Building. \"A loc al shop. Not a swank New York financia l address,\" flitted thr ough his mind. Indeed, there we re many cl ues to let any a mateur Sherlock conc lude Silve r Spring was no financial hub. But the building was serviceabl e, and Micha el could i magine a loca l financia l firm of some reputation locating there. Once through the gold le ttered glass door s of Suite 402, greetings were exc hange d and the elderly la dy who a pparently wa s the s ecretary or office mana ger, mumbled, \"Ms. Bur nham will be right with you.\" She then escorted Michael to a darkly pa neled c onference room. It had an expansive but not overly c ostly table of polished mahoga ny vene er. Michael took a seat in one of the set of eight black A eron chairs around it. Facing him on the long panele d wall was a la rge, modernistic oil of bulls and bears s omewha t in the style of \"Guernica.\" \"Nice touc h,\" thought Michael . He al so noted the thick, multi-hued patterned brown carpet, the overhead projec tor for pres entations, the small bar cabi net in the corner, and the translucent ea rth toned drapes. A door behind him opene d and a ne w female voice w ith a residual Texan draw l said, \"Michae l? I'm J ulia Burnham. It's so nice to meet you. I must apologize , but my secretary said you were here a bout Marc But tervogel. I didn't get your last name.\" Consider now the instant of st anding up a nd turning around, and break it down to its essentials, as Michael w ould often do in the future. It bega n with swiveling and standing during whic h he first saw a tan, rather tight wool skirt . Glanci ng benea th its hem as was his wont, he wa s pleased to see well shape d knees, and muscula r yet slim calves, narrow ankl es, in attractive stockings, and then shoes. A nice pai r of t an business heels that went perfectly with the suit. On the way up, he passed a slim waist, a nic e bust, and took in that he wa s about her height. Now erect, he was startled to confront a familiar face. Although some twenty y ears older, and now w ith makeup, a nd most certainly not containing the satisfied look he ha d seen over coffee, Julia look ed eve ry bit as alluring as he remembered from the photograph on Marc's wall. Graceful a nd business like, she ex tended a long beje weled hand with a wrist r inged in a heavy , eleg ant silver bracele t. The sur prise of recognition momentarily so confused Michael that he couldn't process Julia's question. So s he repeated it. Only then, after his answer, did Julia come to understand that this was not likely to be a normal new c lient intake interview. \"You a re a relation of Marc Buttervogel? ... Half-brot her? Really ? You don't remind me of your brother at all. He wa s a philosopher. At the University of M aryland. He is a clie nt of mine. But you must know that. Actual ly, I was a student of his once. And ...,\" there was some hesitation, \"and what do you do?\" As she processed his r elation to Marc, she wa s astounded by the contrast betwee n Michael a nd his brot her. She slowly c losed the door behind her, and chose a chair ac ross from him. \"I'm in finance. Not ve ry different f rom your operation. But in New Y ork.\" From her vantag e point, Michael Trowley , in his dark blue ca shmere s weater (he had avoide d his tor n suit jacket), paisley tie , red pin str iped button down, and g old Role x, wa s the image of ca sual success, vigor and FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 93Giving and Taking command. He appea red to be the type of man she had a lways fantasized would swoop her up: good looking, strong, mature, and quite possibly rich. From t he moment Michae l recogniz ed her face , which he had seen so sexualize d in the photo, his prior objective s regarding the meeting morphed. Al though Michael' s aura of s uccess was enticing for Julia, his relation to her derisive client put an e dge on her expe ctations regarding the meeting. She stood and closed the door to the fr ont office. Slowly returning to the table, she processed the implications of the complex mixed possibilites. She chose a c loser chair catty-corner from M ichae l. Some further intr oductions and then Michae l discuss ed a bit of his brother's stroke. \"My Lord, this is just horrid. I am so sor ry for him, and for the entire family,\" she replied. \"The family is pretty much just me, and the two of us haven't bee n very close ove r the years.\" \"Still, this must be a terrible shock, Mr. Tr owley .\" \"Michae l, plea se,\" he insisted, realizing that the picture of her had exposed more had seen more than enough of her to warrant the use of firs t names. 'Michael , plea se,' instantly brought back Julia's memories of 'M arc, plea se.' So long ag o, so s eductive at the time. Sudde nly those firs t moments of attraction to his blond Jes us-like brother who ga ve truth fr om the mountain ca me bac k. And then almost simult aneously she thought of the diminished old man who he r assistant had described as coming in w ith his fly open. Wha t time squeezes from us all! \"Certainly, it wa s a terrible change to have my onl y family me mber so t aken dow n. But everyone has reversals.\" \"Still, a t the very lea st, this must have created quite a disruption in your life.\" \"Definitely. It has been. I've taken off more than a few da ys from the office. But what with a cell a nd the internet, I am usually fully c onnected a nyhow.\" \"Yes, these new toys sur ely he lp us in our line of work, don't they, Michael? You know , Marc had come in to see me just a few we eks ago. I wa s bus y with a client, but my a ssistant repor ted that he looked shocking ly dishevele d. I requested that he set up an appointment, but Marc never got back to us to set one up.\" \"Julia, le t me cut to why I am here. I am c oncerned by the combination of Marc's prognos is and his lack of resources. T hey imply a future of financial de pendenc y - quite probably on some combination of the gove rnment and me.\" Julia wa s relieved that there wa s no hint of blame: no c riticism of her fiduciary relationship in her client's undoing. She heard no threatening tone , nor any expl icit implica tion that she had not done her best by her client. Perhaps this unders tanding reflecte d empathy of one fina ncier for a fellow-traveler. After all, there were tremendous complexitie s inherent in the grave responsibilities and hea vy loa ds financial a dvisors must bear. With Julia no longer contempla ting suits and la wyers, the conversation quickly proceeded to a mutual conce rn for securing Marc's financial w ell-being. Indicating that he ha d funds adequate to any suppor t task, Michael wonde red whether he coul d legally support M arc and ha ve Marc elig ible for Medicaid. He also wondered whe ther Marc's hom e must be for eclosed or whether he, Micha el, should pay the back mortgag e pay ments. FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 94Giving and Taking \"You know , these types of choices are neve r on my radar. I jus t don't hardly worry 'bout iss ues of limited means,\" Julia a nswered. Rising to the occ asion, she volunteered that they c ould work together with a ve ry fine local estate attorney, whom she wa s happy to introduce to Michael. Michael w as pleased wi th the propos al. For J ulia, this additiona l dash of unlimited green to Michae l's wardrobe of blues and reds increased his splendor and her attraction. Couple d with wha t Julia took as Michael's forgiveness, her mind shift ed focus fr om the direct latent threats, to a spot closer t o that which Micha el had see n in the photograph. Of course, these mental wande rings were private. To consummate the deal, and reflecting the loss of t raffic in financiers' offices, she off ered a drink. They toasted to the quick a nd complete reha bilitation of his brot her. Sealing the toast with a little squeez e of his hand in a disappointingly motherly fashion, and mouthing something about hopes for Marc's felicity, the major business was tr ansacted. But the late morning dip from the bar, the meeting of hands and the fraternal toast, magica lly led to another agenda. As their conversation took on an ev en more friendly turn, their chairs were found to be edging c loser together. And thus, eventually Micha el brought up the matter that had monopolize d his mind s ince she wa lked into the room. \"I knew your face beca use yesterday, whe n I was at Marc's hous e, I saw a be autiful picture of you on his wall. Wel l, that's not fully accurate : I saw a picture of a bea utiful you on his wall. I couldn't help but notice how all uring you were. S o when y ou walk ed into the room, I was totally surprised to s ee this same face c ome to life and smile a t me.\" \"No kidding? Wha t did the photo look like?\" she asked ca lmly but the sudden blush on her neck a nd chee ks reflected her internal commotion. \"It was a picture of the two of you shot in a mirror in a bedroom,\" \"Oh, that one!\" A nd her blush left. \"Glad to hear it is the one shot in the mirr or. I don't t hink he still had any of the others .\" This r elaxed banter led to a refres her of their glass es, and to her laughter, we lcoming the ne w subject. She tossed her head provoca tively. \" So you know, I already have qui te a rela tion with your family. Y our brot her and I have ha d rather good times together.\" \"That is certainly the wa y it looks in the picture.\" \"But it s ure didn't end with proper, shall I say 'closure.' He dissolved into some s izeable puddle of guilt and grief when hi s wife was diagnosed w ith canc er. Then he sort of blamed me for his lack of caring about her ca ncer. After that we saw e ach other very rarely . But years later - way a fter his wife's death a nd my marriage a nd kids, and after I began this business , one day he burst in and demande d that I make lots of money for him. Well, you c an imag ine how I told him such goals are risky. I gave him our ris k tolerance profile to fill out. I remember his r esponse: he came back say ing how our affair was risky and I s houldn't worry about any risks he was taking. In exc hange , I asked him to retur n some of his photos.\" While she wa s saying this, s he couldn't he lp thinking about the great diminution of Marc over time. Suddenly , she beca me self-conscious at how much she had just told Marc's br other. So she altered course. \"But tell me about yourself! What ha s life dealt you while y our brot her whiled a way at Maryland in phil osophy and then retired into a virtual bankruptcy?\" Not unhappy with the turn to personal matters , Michael responded \"Nothing as beautiful as you, if I may say.\" FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 95Giving and Taking The words wor ked their cha rm and sharpened the contrasting appea l of this hands ome, younge r brother. M ichae l, content with the c hange in conversational tone a dded to his quip by giving he r a peak a t his accomplishments - s enior partner at Virtuality Financ ial Se rvices, along w ith a scanty list of mergers and IPO's t hat he ha d engine ered. Wi thout mentioning his nepotist ic climb on to Daddy's lap, the achie vements had a he roic ring to thos e with a n MB A in financ e. He c rafted his abbrevia ted list of pos sessions and achie vements to bait a hook a nd indica te his interest in fishing in her pond. She like d the bait. \"Perhaps we should make a nother toast t o our continued relationship with the goa l of helping your brother? \" she said, aga in putting her warm hand on his. She got up slowly and, looking him straight in the e ye with her sof t gray-green ey es, t he'd like to imbibe this time. With still more alcohol a nd a conve niently c losed door, the paneled room helpe d incubate a verbal intercourse that promis ed other dimensions. She returned fr om the bar with tumblers containing more single malt and he stood up t o intercept her trajectory. Standing , now far closer than their chairs had bee n, he made the toast, \"to our working and other relationship dedicated to the felicity of membe rs of both your and my families.\" \"I like these contracts. They contain the promis e of fulfillment: of both a giving a nd a taking .\" she said with a big smile a nd more of the light laughter that she was so good at bringing to the negotiations. So the conferenc e room came to host a second, more intense and fervent expl oratory meeting. He bega n it by putting his hand on her shoulder and saying, whi le looking into her eyes, \"Is this company a ll your acc omplishment? \" ... \"It is? You mus t be very proud of it. You must be very good a t your work.\" Noticing that she didn't move a way, he put down his drink and plac ed his other hand at her wa ist. She moved closer to thank him, in a rather quiet voic e. Slowly , and ge ntly, he pulle d her to him in a fashion pregnant with promises. She gave hi m a light kiss on the check saying , \"I like you. \" His hand slipped from her waist to her ass, pulling her thighs to him, s o she could feel the ha rdness and hea t. As she also tabled her drink, the light kiss turned to s omething far more serious . He could fee l her tighten the muscles benea th his hand and faintly push forward to r ub aga inst his crotch. She reac hed for pants, and he added hi s hand to hers , press ing it more tightly to him. Smiling, he let go of her hand, a nd moved his to undo her s uit jacke t. With it falling ope n he ga ined ac cess to a sheer white silken blouse cove ring a visibly la cy bra, through whic h he bega n to gently massage her nipples. As they responded, she leane d aga inst the edge of the table a nd searched for the top of his fly. \"Let's go into my off ice w here we w on't be interrupted,\" she said and led him through the door s he closed. He stood next to her as she sat at her off ice de sk and call ed her receptionist. \"This meeting is continuing in my office, and don't interrupt. I'll get back to y ou when it is over.\" She swivell ed her cha ir back in his direction, a nd now her hea d was at precisely the right height to peruse the fly she had yet to open. He pressed it gently into her face , and she pushed him awa y enough to continue the play. \"We 're lucky i t's almost lunch time, a nd I have a g ood appetite,\" she said, licking her lips. And after a moment she was play ing with her food most deliciously with her tongue, her lips, and her hands. As he bec ame more aroused and sway ed to her pulses he caressed her head a nd bega n to moan. Just before he would ha ve come , he pulle d awa y and sugge sted moving to her couch, w here she might enjoy some role reversal. \"You've also worked up an a ppetite?\" FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI PAGE - 96Giving and Taking \"Nothing better.\" \"Great!

And as he move d down the aroma of a v ery aroused Julia egg ed him on, and lead hi m to the nub of the project. Clea rly, the two of them found there was ample room for mut ual satisf action in the c ontracts they were considering. Spent, Julia wa s putt ing her bra bac k on, with that same ex press ion that Michael had observed in the photo. But he could now also observe her long leg s, and tight fanny still without panties on. Her blonde bush was dripping from t heir fluids and he smiled as he took her back i n his arms , \"Let's not mes s up your carpeted office.\" And he wiped thei r fluids onto his hand with a slow, and sensual brus h of her crotch, just tickling the tip of her clitoris. It s ent a final tremor through her spine, and put another smile on her face. Flexing her thigh muscles she trapped his hand where she wanted i t, and wig gled on it a bit, kissing him deeply. W hen she relaxe d a bit, he le t her lick off one finger, and did the other. Walking ove r toward her desk, s till with only he r bra, in fr ont of what he presumed to be tinted or mirr ored windows,\"W e still haven't gotten to a ny of the details to secure a financ ial future for your brother. T hat might require a second visit,\" she said with a coy sound in her voice . \"Well we c ould do that after I visit Marc - s ay late this afternoon or this evening.\" \"That might be arranged.

We should be able to sustain a pleasurable business relationship.\" FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 97CHAPTER the next week s, Michael's respons ibilities in Montgomery county grew. Not only did he hav e to come down to see Marc, but he ha d to set up a fiduciary ac count with the help of his new, l ong legge d, soft eyed friend. Everything took time a nd attention to detail. For example, to have Medicaid a ccept respons ibility for Marc's nur sing home bills, Marc could have no more than $ 2000 in a ssets. That meant no home and no ca r. The car was a junke r in any case. A nd given the fa ll in home prices and the mortgag e, the home ha d no value for M arc. Michae l took out the few things of pers onal interest such as the family photos and had them framed for Marc's r oom at the hospital. The photo of J ulia, he put in his br iefcase to be ta ken out only on special oc casions. Julia sold the assets left in Marc's investment account at wha t everyone c ould later identify as fire sale prices and used the cha nge to pay off s ome of his s maller bills. Bankruptcy court would dispose of mos t of the res t. All Marc would be left with to show of his earlier life w ould be some clothing, and a few personal pictures. Even his big be nefit, his health insurance inherited from Elsa's long employ at Defense had no va lue if he coul dn't pay the premiums. Marc's pr ognosis was not pr omising. Soon Marc would have to be moved to a reha b facility. The doctors made it cl ear that Marc would c ontinue to need he avily assis ted care, e ven if the most optimistic s cenarios f or rehab were obtaine d. Marc neede d a suitable pla ce to continue his life. The task was difficult, and time consuming. Suc h needs bred respons ibilities and Micha el had to tak e sufficient trips and time from home to make sur e the arrange ments were right. These fr equent dal liances with Julia, mea nt more familiarity. And so Michael' s ardor , induced by his initial introduction to Marc's s exual ized pa st was diminished but hardly extinguished. And for Julia, the path to the real green, to the money beyond the simple c ommiss ion for handling the assets Michael put into the fiducia ry acc ount, was getting ev er less vis ible. W ith that shr inking monetiz ed allure, Micha el, though still attractive, l ost some of his immediate eroticism. But t here remained pleasure enough, a nd whene ver he wa s in town, he and Julia settled into a qui et routine of meeting at his hotel for a nightca p. The erotic can be improved by ele ments of s urpris e, and Micha el deve loped a fa ntasy that, even before being ca rried out, put an edge ba ck into their meetings. Michae l considered reintroducing Julia to Marc. Julia would, of course, be introduced a s Marc's lover. Just thinking about wi nning this f orm of s ibling compe tition increased the plea sure of their sexual encounte rs. The knowledg e that no one could judg e this fr aternal c ompetition as fair, perversely aroused Michael ev en more. So it was that one a fternoon, after t he two of them had spent a coupl e of hours looking for a nursing home for Marc, Julia and Michae l were discussing this plan in her silver M ercedes, parking a t the National R ehabil itation Hospital in downtown DC . Turning off the motor, J ulia be gan, \" You know, I hope you're right that Marc doesn't recognize me. It would be a te rrible shock if he did. Don't introduce me as your lover or partner. At least wait until we rea lly establish that he doesn't know me. Just s ay I am a n ex-student of his . I am after all. OK?\" Michael l aughe d. \"Sure, bea utiful.

You've got the wrong impress ion, you a nd I aren't about Marc. You are one of the very best things that's happened in my life.\" Julia took her time taking this in before reacting. \"OK, let's go in.\" W hen they g ot out of t he ca r they were hit by a blustery late March wind. They buttoned up their jacke ts and st arted wal king into the wind. \"You know , I got an idea this mor ning. You' re having some trouble finding a g ood place . I had the same problem looking for a nursing home for m y father. I got in touch with some woman a t the County Se nior Services Office. She wa s super. They gave me two or three names, and they were a ll really g ood. So maybe that's the place to go for help. They ha ve no dog in this fight and could g ive us a better scr eening as to where to look.\" \"OK, I can do that tomorrow. But for t oday, i t's M arc and then, are you goi ng home to your kids, or can we ha ve a l ittle supper? \" \"Is this an invitation only for supper? \" \"I didn't think we nee ded a publi c discussion of the menu.\" \"Supper could be arranged,\" she said w ith some of t he old coque ttish er otic references and flamboyanc e that had ma rked their passionate beginning. S tepping out of the eleva tor; they were quickly in It's me,\" wa s Michae l's greeting. Julia, who ha d not been to the rehab c enter before, was stepping in the small room behind Michael. She wa s taken aba ck by the sight of the man that she last considered a la ughing stock. Here he wa s immobilized in a w heel c hair. With a n effort , he could rai se his head a bit from a slumping position on his chest. This movement all owed Marc a field of vision beyond the floor. He didn't speak. Michael sped on, \" How is the big guy doi ng?\" Still no reply. \"I wonde r if you recall this beautiful la dy here?\" Marc couldn't move his hea d enough to see her. Michae l put his arm around Julia's waist and moved he r to be visible. \"Ca n you see her now Marc? Reme mber her?\" J ulia thought she s aw a small shudder pass through Marc's face. Marc couldn't get his head to go more ve rtical. All he wa s seeing were le gs in trous ers. J udging by the shoes, one set was masculine, the other femine. Hi s visit or had alwa ys come alone : a routine that had bec almed his tumultuous br ain. The second pa ir of legs led Marc to feel uneasy. But he FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 100Sibling Riv alry had no wa y to communica te any of his internal world, a nd so, in every wa y, he w as unable to master any of the deta ils of his environment. He felt himself an inert objec t being ac ted upon. Michael took no note. \"Tell him who you a re, hon!\" Michae l's use of \"hon\" violated her understanding of the bargain: she wa s to be intr oduced a s an ex student, not as M ichae l's partner. Although Marc took in most of t he words as pure nois e, he did unde rstand them to be a communica tion attempt. He wa s regaining passive lang uage recognition but speakers had to slow their speech for M arc to understand any of it. And now the other person was talking to him. She was knee ling down. He r face ca me into view. A face that he recogniz ed as coming from his past. M ore noise, \"Hello Profess or Buttervogel. I used to be a phi losophy student of yours. Do you remember, you were a profes sor at the University of Maryland?\" Marc wanted to a sk who she was. He wa nted her to speak more slowly. He w anted time to study her face, to give hi m time to underst and. He tried to say something. Al l that came out was a sound combining a moan a nd a soft grunt . It was his f irst verbal communic ation since they had come in the room. \"You do?\" said Julia wi th mock exci tement. Silenc e. Julia c ould no longer imag ine how she a nd this old man had related. W hat wa s their connection to those two pass ionate love rs who, so long ago a t the University of M aryland, fucked aw ay thei r afternoons as if there was no tomorr ow? And what wa s going on in the hea d of his br other? T he answer to that last question was answered rather quickly . The man was speaking . \"Surprise of all times, M arc. Your ex-student and I are in love. We' re partners, t rying to set up a home for you, and to take c are of you. She i s wonderful - in lots of ways. I wish you could imagi ne. Any how, may be you'd li ke her to give y ou a kiss? \" But M arc could not turn his head to see him. A nd he wa s speaki ng slowly now, deliberate ly. Marc understood the words 'love' and 'home. ' He wa nted to tell the man to speak slowe r. But of cours e that wa sn't possible. Dutifully, Julia lea ned forward, held on to the arm of the whee l chai r, and kissed him on the cheek. But M arc's head ha d drooped back dow n on his chest. Julia took his head in her hands and moved it so they could look in e ach others' eye s. Again, a lthough Marc couldn't identify he r face, he knew she ca me from his past. Standing a bit apart, Michae l observed that if Marc had just been able to move his head, to look in the right direction, he woul d have be en able to see the swell of Julia's heave nly breasts down the front of her s coop-necke d blouse. The blouse had been put on to tease Micha el. It gave him a thrill that she could have been tanta lizing hi s brother, that her breasts were inc hes fr om him, and ye t, totally out of his reach. FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 101CHAPTER LAZARUS Following Julia's advi ce, Micha el tried to phone the director of the Montgomery County Senior Services Office. For weeks he nev er got past the fr iendly robotic a nswering message, \"At the tone, please le ave y our mess age for t he Director.\" Of course he tried to do this . But the s ame friendly robot r esponded, \"W e are sorry. The Dir ector's voice mail box is full. Tr y again la ter.\" Eventua lly, giving up on the possibility of directly communic ating wi th a fellow huma n, Michael sent a rather detaile d email. Having no e xpecta tions of a switch in personnel, he w as confident of a prompt respons e to help secure a quality pla ce for Marc. On the other end of the wire, over almost the same period, Margery had settled into her new salary (and office). She chec ked her ema il wee kly. More to the point, a rectang ular elec tronic slave displayed c olor photographs on t he corner of her desk. Her Dr oid was alw ays on Pandora streaming her favorite techno to her wireless headset. And most wonderfully, she had a reserved space for her metallic blue BMW. These upgrades gav e her considerable c omfort . Margery had so gaine d in self-confidence that her uncle Charles had not been consulted since her promotion. And with the 2009 flowe ring of crocuses and daffodils and the budding of az aleas, Margery had been forced to take time to cull out la st year's mini-s kirts, and sort s ome of the lighter items in her wardrobe. On rare occa sions she st ill called Frances for help, but most of the time, Margery felt she could handl e her job. Frances, after all, ha d left meticulous records. After years of r ecrea tional drug use at fraternity parties M argery did not have Frances' laser-like ability to retrieve de tails of cases. Nor was s he a c areful librarian of records. B ut one Friday, she was chec king her ema il, and one of them caught her attention whe n she saw the name 'Buttervogel' in the subject line. Hi s brother wanted information regarding a quality a ssisted living facil ity. Although she could not reca ll how she knew the name, see ing the name generate d unsympathetic vibes. Given a ll the eve nts of the last months , she felt it unimport ant that she could not recal l the details. She dismissed the idea of going into he r computerized notes to explore what might be leading to this f eeling of aliena tion. But s he did search a few of Frances' notes. Finding nothing, Margery respected her own lac k of enthusiasm f or helping this 'But tervogel,' a nd moved on to the next emai l. A few w eeks later, howe ver, she reread the emai l. Now the still extant, ne gative valence regarding Buttervogel was considerably faded. A v ague pull to action oc curred. She responded to Mr. T rowley by directing him to Phillip Thompson, t he mana ger of the Charter House. And so Michael ma de an a ppointment to visit T he Cha rter Hous e, whic h he hoped w ould be a most s uitable pla ce for his br other. Michael's initiation to the C harter House was not tot ally unlike those who had precede d him. It happened on one of those trips to Silver Spring, squeeze d betwee n other urgent bus iness meetings with Marc's f inanci al advisor. M en are rela tively rela xed after sex, and so Michael w as daydrea ming about other things when he a rrived at the Cha rter Hous e. Not being ve ry attentive to the matters at hand, the cobw ebs on the chande liers never attracted his attention. Nor did the dust on t he lea ves of the plastic plants. He didn't even notic e the woma n approaching him from t he side. Wha t did occupy hi s mind, was the very sexy removal of those red lacy panties Julia had be en we aring and how her hips s ubsequently felt under his hand as he lay next to her on her couch. FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 102A Home fo r Lazarus These thoughts were interrupted when a n apparent ba g lady screeched, \" Whatcha doin' in he re, mister? Waitin fer a manag er, huh? Well he a in't coming, that for sur e.\" The woma n asking those questions was only inches from him. Where she came from wasn't clea r although she looked as if she had just left panhandling. He r breath sm elled l ike an overripe garbage dump. \"Scared? You don't belong here do you? Why don't you give me some of that money you got in yer fancy suit and I'll go get me a me al.\" \"Glady s, please; Glady s, please!\" ye lled a chea p suited man, running through an office door behind the la rge marble and w ood front reception area . The presumed Gladys wandered off toward the front door . Not st opping to regain his breath, the ma n continued, \"Y ou must be M r. Trowley . Phil Thomps on here. Don't mind Gladys. She' s had a number of minor s trokes. She's harmless . But s he doesn't put our best foot for ward, does she?\" Mr . Thomps on stuck out his hand. But when Micha el did not take it, Phil withdrew it to his pocket. \"W hy don't we retire to my office where we won't be disturbed.\" They wa lked through a door to a servicea ble, pa neled office. It reminded Michae l of the sor ts of offices given to the salesmen at his Ca dillac deale r. On the wall were some photographs and a few c ertificates of merit f rom the Silver Spring Chambe r of Commerce. There was a large picture entitled 'The C harter House Community, 2002.' To its right hung an a ward comple te with a photo of Mr. T hompson. I t was captione d, 'Mr. T hompson, Manage r of t he Ye ar, 2003 - First Centrum, L LC.' The next line , in a bold ita licized red font: 'America's Most Experienced Develo pers of Senior Thomps on sat behind his desk, and motioned Michae l to a large , over-st uffed leather club c hair. Next to it was an 'a ged' w ooden table and a l amp. \"Now, Mr. T rowley, c an I get you if I recall from our phone conversation you were looking to place your brother her e. He ha d a major stroke, no? I presume you were thinking of something like an assisted living arrangement. W hy don't you giv e me some idea of his medical and fina ncial situation.\" And so Michael be gan w ith the latest prognosis . \"Of course, I can't say for s ure. But t he doctors are telling us that my brother , Marc, will probably never wa lk aga in, eve n with a w alker. But he may become qui te capa ble of 'transfer ring' from a wheel c hair to a bed or toilet. He is begi nning to vocaliz e a bit, but I don't think he'll rega in a fluenc y in his speech. So he will ha ve difficulty articulating hi s interes ts to aides eve n were they patient.

I can recommend some of the area's finest nurs ing facil ities to you if that would be helpful.\" Mr. T hompson didn't r ush, but he fingered the woode n pull of his desk's right hand drawer, whe re he kept the list of recommended homes annotated with their referral payme nts. \"Do you know if Marc, that was your brother's name, wasn't it? Would Marc be elig ible upon le aving the rehab hospital?\" \"My brother's bankruptcy is now being processed. He has lost his home, and ha s virt ually nothing left. So I am assuming Medicaid wi ll go through for him.\" \"But excuse me sir, then how would he ha ve pai d rent here? We aren't a Medic aid fac ility.\" \"I am setting up a support fund for him to be manag ed by a local attorney and financ ial advisor. It will be sufficient to purchase all the addi tional services, equipment, a nd help that could ma ke his life more comfortable.\" \"So you a re thinking that you might pla ce him he re and purchase, privatel y, the medic al support services? M edica id won't pay toward his expenses here. So I think that could be prohibitive. A s I mentioned, if you w ant, I can gi ve you a referr al. Y ou can ima gine w e have good working rela tions with a number of exce llent homes in the neighborhood since ma ny of our res idents come to need more intensive care from time to time.\" Running out of patie nce w ith this lack of closure, and not wanting to inve st the time himself, Michael a sked if he might just call his brother's financia l advisor. \"Ce rtainly, and to gi ve you some privacy, why don't you do this from our conference room next door.\" No sooner in the conference room Michael c ontacted Julia, \"Hi, sweets. We got a no-winner from t he Senior Servic es Lady.\" \"Who w as she?\" \"I ditz ca lled W illiams or Wittman. I'm pretty sur e it bega n with a W .\" \"Well that's not who helped me . My helpful lady must have left.\" \"Well I can save a bundle by putting him in a nurs ing home.

I 'm a hig h maintena \"OK, I'll get his list of r eferrals. See you a s usual, a round 9?\" And then flicked off his phone and we nt back into Thompson's office. Less t han hal f an hour later he wa s leaving the C harter FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 104A Home fo r Lazarus House with the referrals. Walking a cross the lobby, he stepped bris kly to avoi d any possibility of the bag la dy who w as moving to intercept his passage. ******** And so it came a bout that in May, Marc wa s placed in a nurs ing home a round the corner fr om the Cha rter Hous e. Michae l had put aside e nough money to insure his comfor t, and more importantly, to insur e the nursing home had an i nterest in his continued we lfare. He soon recovered sufficiently to be able to be taken out for occasional strolls in his wheel cha ir. Michael, Julia , and sometimes even the two of them, came to visit. Soon after, he was given a n elec tric wheel c hair, courtesy of M ichae l and his funds. Eventually , as a highe r-functioning resident, Marc was able to use it to have some limited control of his whereabouts in the facility. On be autiful days, the three of them could be seen ta king a w alk toge ther outs ide and e njoying the w eather. By now, he wa s used to his brot her's woman friend. Marc never grew comfortable w ith Julia. Some unsettling thread of recognition wa s still in tact. It led him to feel a nger and vic timhood. Their r elationship put him on edge . Without the guida nce of an inta ct memory, Marc couldn't locate these two in his past. Of course, he had bee n told that Michael w as his br other. Were he to take this for knowledge, then so be it. But Marc was insecure in factual conjec tures. Not that he felt Michael a stranger. He had some understanding of what it would feel like to hav e a brother, and to be with one. But he never arrived comfortably to such a plac e in the presence of Micha el. His mind rarely felt as it ought to when Michae l was there. So, a lthough he wa s told M ichae l was his brother, he neve r was secure enough to own the rela tionship. B ut in most other res pects, Marc was fortunate. Unli ke other patients in the home, he w as neither regularly ove r-drugged, nor neg lected. The doubts went dee per than angst regarding the rela tionship. Marc unders tood that he had a brain disease. The disease threatened his comprehension of who and w hat he once was. Since , a man without a pa st does n't have a full present, there was little depth to his every-day life. These two visitors often told him that he had once been a profes sor. He had be en Julia's teac her. Wha t precisely that mea nt, he couldn't grasp. Though he couldn't remembe r or r eally comprehend the meaning of these things, he did have dee p-seated feelings regarding both of these people. Marc knew a nd felt that he had some relation w ith Julia, and a lso with Michael. But the labe ls didn't fit his feelings and so he didn't comprehend the situation. It led him to furt her question his own cognitive capa bilities. In any ca se, Marc liked that they c ame to visit. This, even though every time he noticed the physical intima cy of the two of them, he w as uncomfortable, even a ngry. Whe n they hugge d, or kissed an alarm we nt off in his mind, signaling a n unrecoverable distant memory. This jarring was always distas teful. By June, when Julia a nd Michael w alked with Marc, his condition had improved sufficiently so he wa s given control of the wheelc hair's joystick outside. He rejoiced in the sense of power and freedom this gave him. Though watchful, Julia a nd Michael w ere at some distance, tal king on their own. C racks in the sidewalks rolled under the whe els, lampposts r olled by a nd Marc felt exhilarate d. This ability to propel himself around the block with his joystick controller gave him some release. The use of the joystick usually required a ll his concentration. But this beautiful June afternoon he was suf ficiently alert to shift some attention to a heav ily accented woman's voice calling out his name. Her ca ll to him caused him to let go of the joy stick. The scooter s topped. FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 105A Home fo r Lazarus \"Mister Butt ervogel!

Vhy is dis new cha ir for you?\" Still not fully ca pable of raising his head, Marc c ouldn't fully see Ruth Dedrick , but her thick German acc ent brought on a smile. Marc smiled. For t he first time in his new life. He smiled. Michael a nd Julia, we re behind the whe el cha ir, and couldn't see the smile. They move d forward to introduce themselves. But t hey w ere stopped by Marc, who tried to utter a respons e. Only some of the words came out properly formed. \"Egh ha p see too. Egh ha p hear too! Who y ou?\" Quickly striding to be at his side, Michael que stioned the old woman, \"Y ou know Marc? Were you a student of his? \" But he couldn't really fathom that poss ibility, gi ven her ag e. So he qui ckly followed wi th \"How do you know my brother? \" \"Ja. Your broder has helped me y ou know. De professor helped me vit my Skype to talk to my yenga la. Y ou ver vonderful, ja? Herr P rofes sor. Unt. Unt. Now look a t you vid all dis ts oris. Terrible. A nd who are y ou two?\" \"I'm his br other, Michael. A nd this is Julia, my friend. Profes sor Butt ervogel's firs t name is Marc. He's no longer himself.\" \"Nice me eting you, Julia Burnham-Lambert,\" added Julia with her hand ex tended. But the proff ered handshake was overlooked. \"Vat did you say? I can't hear so good.\" The greetings were repe ated, w ithout the extended hand, a nd a friendly protocol wa s established. \"V at den ha ppened to de Profess or?\" \"He ha d a stroke,\" boomed Michae l, who dec ided that without further evidence, he should assume he needed to y ell as loudly as she did to communicate. \" And who a re you?\" \"I am sorr y.\" \"Who a re you?\" repeated el. Julia g ave Micha el a k nowing look, putting her doubts regarding the sanity of the procee ding on the table . \"Ruth Dedrick from de Cha rter Hous e, right here. But ver do you go? I can valk vi d you for a bit, no?\" And so the 4 of them walke d, two by two. First it was M ichae l and R uth taking the le ad, but after the initial interview , Ruth recla imed her Profes sor. They went a round the block a second time, until they found themselves on the sidewalk, once a gain, di rectly outside the Cha rter Hous e. \"Good bye Mrs. Dedrick,\" bega n Julia. \"Y ou know Marc live s practically across t he street, at the Wonde rCare Home right on First Avenue .\" \"Vell I vill visit Herr D octor. Tell him. Unt maybe ve can a lso take valk s, no? \" Michael a nd Julia wa lked Marc in, a nd told him of his newly found old friend. For the firs t time, there was a positive response, a smile of recognition and unde rstanding. A nd then, they le ft him in the care of W onderCare to retire for part of the night. ******** FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 106A Home fo r Lazarus What would one ex pect from a lonely, elderly w oman who finds an ac quaintanc e that nee ds help?

The meal s were magic ally paid for by whomeve r was picking up Marc Buttervogel's tab. They w ere a va riety welc ome to the limited pal ette of her own cooking. And Marc took to her as a child reuniting with a mother. She even c ame to understand some of his babbles, whic h she could then turn into conversations.

FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 107CHAPTER 19: BULL'S-EYE Life had improved for M arc, eve n if he couldn't fully unde rstand his situation. Gone were his financia l problems. T he threat of criminal prosecution was history. Even his solitary existence ha d been spiced up by the occa sional visits of his s urviving relative . But mos t surprisingly, his mother miraculously repea tedly returned to check in on him. She e ven took him for outings. T hese positive chang es had give n him a reason to work harder at his physical therapy. His improvement had been noted and his doctors s ubstantially cut ba ck his anti-depressants . Although others might describe him as sitt ing immobile, this Friday in Novembe r, he was exc itedly a nticipating the unfolding of the day. Looking out of the window in the tele vision lounge, he w as fully awa re that the good wea ther could bring another visit from his mother. If Aus chwitz ha d insured one thing, it guarantee d that Ruth Dedrick w asn't supers titious. Indeed, on that fateful Friday, Novembe r 13 , she was feeling most fort unate. Y esterday's call,th from Sophie, put her in a wonderful mood. They had shared a long conversation. Sophie w as planning a rare visit to t he Ea st coast. At last, s he wa s seeing a wonde rful man. What coul d be better. And this mor ning, with its bright blue sky, and unusually warm breeze s the idea of a wa lk around Silver Spring put a smile in her hea rt. She would share her joy whe n she visited Marc at WonderC are. Marc had be en an une xpected bl essing, sending her back to times so many yea rs ago: before the death of her only son. Her frequent visits with Marc and their slow perambula tions through the quiet str eets of the neighborhood brought her a feeling of completion. A fter putt ing on her worn, but ser vicea ble, brown coa t she s tood in front of her s mall frame mirror, and tied a silk scarf to keep her ears warm and her hair in pla ce. She felt for her cozy gloves in the coa t pockets. They were there. A ll was well in the world. Down the ele vator then, and a cross the foyer toward the str eet. There remained but one obstacle, her enc ounter with Gladys. Long ago, R uth had lea rned that a preemptive g reeting could defuse her neighbor's anger. \"Gut morning, Gladys! It is s o gut to see you are ve l, unt up unt about, today, ja?\" \"Course. Wa ddya think I am? Gotta go get my ke ep. Top of the mornin' to you too. B ut watch out for all de thie ves, Ruth. Dem guy s are all around now. A nd everyone is packin'. Y ou gotta be ca reful,\" Gladys' replied. \"I most certainly vill. Y ou be ca reful too! T ank you so much.\" A nd then it was out the door, to the right, and over to Wonde rCare. E ntering WonderC are wa s alway s bur eaucratic. The firs t obstacle wa s the 'Welc ome Desk.' The Wel come Desk woma n was in essence a corporate security officer. Corporate security, for t he Wonde rCare faci lity wa s part of the eponymous national chain of nurs ing homes, was the raison d'etre of the welc ome desk, required a ca reful handling of any visitor on t he premises. After all, the company wouldn't wa nt the visitor to see an overly drugge d patient, or a soiled bed. The Welc ome Lady, a nd it was alw ays a la dy, inva riably dressed gayly in a fully a ccessorized, bright suit , had col or coordinated makeup, and displaye d a la rge font identification tag. Today , the woman in the red suit and pink sca rf was Sally Perkins. Sally knew Mrs. Dedrick. Sally knew this visitor t o be harmless and so her greeting was enthusiastic and not particularly sec urity oriented. Today's Welc ome Lady c hecke d on Marc's whereabouts, discovered it to be the TV lounge, a nd FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 108Bull's-Ey e called over an e scort nur se's ass istant to accompany Ruth to the lounge. Of cours e, by now Ruth knew the routine, a s well as the route. She wa s even used to the faint smell of chlorofor m in the eleva tor. When exiting she looked to the left, and sure enough, there w as Marc, in his wheelc hair. As she hailed Marc, the e scort t ook the ele vator back dow n. \"It is vonderbar out side, Herr Doktor . Vye not ve go now outside unt valk in town, and g et a cookie, ja?\" Although a lmost mot ionless, and still with only rudimentary speech, Marc ha d the internal reac tion of a happy c hild, who just was reunited with his long absent mother. One of the few plac es the observant could see his happiness was in the wrinkles around his eyes. \"So ve g o now unt get your svetter, ja?\" Somehow, R uth's accent a nd locution made her speech more comprehensible to Marc than the Eng lish of native speakers. Marc responded by pushing on the joystick that controlled the whe elcha ir. But it hadn't been turned on. R uth bent down, turned the switch on and ga ve him a w elcome hug. He be amed. Soon, he wa s outs ide, wi th his warm blue sweater. There he wa s joining Ruth on one of their ritual walk s around Silver Spring. They turned right at Georgia Avenue , toward downtown, a nd she talked slowly , always eve r so slowly, of recipes: wha t she us ed to cook for Thanksgiving when he r son was st ill with her. And the n some more banter, what did Marc like to e at? With patienc e, and Ruth had ple nty of this, t hey c ommunicated. He could ge t the gist and she could decode his guttur al expressions . He like d sweet potatoes and stuff ing. So like Ruth's husband, which le d Ruth to talk of him again. Aga in, he die d in the wa r, tying Marc's vision of his mother's return a bit closer to his subconscious expectations. \"My vonderful man, he vod ha ve love d Danksgiving, ja ? But that vas not to be. So Marc, am I so like your Mutti? I vonder vat she vas, ja?\" Marc too wondered about this question. Why would hi s mother ask him such a question? What did it mean a bout who he wa s, what was his reality? But t hen he rela xed ag ain into the enj oyment of the str oll. So they w ent, down Georgia , cross ing over to stop to get a cookie a t a small pastry shop, and then ha nging a left on Way ne Ave nue. Just after the turn, Marc s topped the whee lchair. It was just pr ior to the Everett Building by a sign for a Fortune T eller. He di d that some times. I t was tiring to pres s on the joystick all the time to go forward. \"Y ou vant a rest? Ve can shtop here, ja? Ve ha ve no such rush. Vat a spot to s htop; here is die Fortune T eller. She can tel l von de future. You pay ten dollar unt she tell you va t vill come vor you. Is it true? Vat you tink, Marc? Can she tell de future, oder nicht?\" l? What she is a gy psy in dis s tore here, Marc. Dis s ign tells us s he give s us de future for only ten dollars.\" \"Mine?\" was the cle ar question fr om Marc. \"Ja, dat is vat a g ypsy says. She tells about you. It is a magic .\" \"Here?\" was all that Marc uttered. But behind the stroke's mask of difficult speech a de sperate thought took shape in a mind baffled by the simplest f acts of existence. W as his mother saying that the fortune teller would uncover the a nswers t hat elude d him? Would she make intel ligible the world he could no long er underst and? The sign told of a cha nce to rega in some grasp as to who he was, is, and wil l be. It gave him a hope tha t he could understand who his brother was. Who his mother is. What it meant to be a professor . Who w as that student? Why w as he alw ays angry in their presence? T he magni tude of the PAGE - 109Bull's-Ey e leane d on the joy stick without convic tion. He moved further down the sidewalk. He wa s reluctant but he wa s choosing against knowledg e. Ag ainst rebirth. A s low twenty five feet or so further down the sidewa lk and they were in front of the Everett Building. The big bronze letters with the name \"Julia Burnham Lambert\" could have put a link in pla ce in R uth's mind, telling her this f inanci al advisor was the partner of Marc's br other. But the bronze on blac k tie wa sn't sufficiently interesting to be st ored in her mind. In a far more opaque and fuzz y fashion those s ame bronzes had signifiga nce for Marc. And with his slow improvement som e old conne ctions were regene rated inside Marc. They ca used a memory to st ir. By thems elves, the le tters were unintell igible. But in combination with the quivering memories, they stirr ed up still unclea r but long uncovered and a lmost los t emotional connec tions that had once bee n central in his mind. Bits of unintelligibl e history came bubbling up. As he stared at the Everett Building, once Silver Spring's most ambitious constr uction, its black marble exterior and strong aluminum vertical li nes evoked something positively primitive w ithin him. Somehow, those bronzed le tters brought to mind his brother's partner more clearly than i f he had bee n able to rea d the sign. Although not tied to any internal narrative, free floating from any factual e nvironment, they tied that woma n who cla imed to be his student to complicated feeli ngs: feelings of desperation and fury. But M arc could ma ke no sense of it. Patterns were restructur ing themselves into shapes that though new, echoe d something old. Wha t thos e shapes were a nd how they tied to his past wasn't clea r. Images of a beautiful woman ne xt to him, remembrances of sexuality, a nd then a sense of deep betraya l by Michae l all c ame up a jumble. Feelings of anger and some va gue a pparition of a gun all came to his mind, in a tangle of immediate ma dness. Not hing fully made sense, but neither had those very recently a cquired imag es of Michael a s a caring brother and those of M ichae l's lover. As he wrestled with this mons trosity he turned to his mother to explain that something wa s terr ibly wrong a nd deeply troubling. Overwrought, he wa s unable to spare the energy required to form s peech. He couldn' t verbalize his frustration. Ins tead a primitive instinct to f lee w elled up i n him. Upstairs in the Eve rett B uilding, on the fourth floor, J ulia stopped working a t her computer, and slowly rotated in her cha ir. She looked a t her watch. A bit after noon; time to get some lunch. She was hungry. W ithout a luncheon a ppointment, she decided to browse the many sandwich shops locate d in the new pl aza across t he street fr om her building. Looking out the window wall of her office she saw the sun was bright; people we re dress ed for a slight chill in the a ir. She stood up, stretched, a nd put on her coat. She c hecke d to make sure she had her wall et. She looke d in the small mirror she kept in her purs e and smiled. Life wa s good. Michael w as generous with her, business was picking up aga in. And she wa s happy that her husband and chil dren didn't have a clue that she was having this affair. She put on a fresh coat of her burgundy colored lipstick, a nd blotted it on a tissue. She exited he r office and told the receptionist that she'd retur n in less than an hour. Tearing at his joystick with a hithe rto unknown determination, Marc jerkily turned the whe el chair around, ba ck down the bl ock. He w as speeding toward the fortune teller: toward promised knowledg e, no longe r rejecting his speculative rebirth. The chai r raced forward and his foot r ests hit the entrance door of the small shop with a subst antial thud. A n overweig ht, late middle -aged woman c ame to the door and opene d it. As she s tood to the side, Marc went in. Although he was clearly not overdress ed, and i t was somewhat chilly , he wa s now sweating profusely. Hardly hal f a minute behind, R uth followed him into the store. Marc excitedly tried to express his des ire to know his fut ure. But he was too excited to articula te the words. What ca me out was gibberish. Further , FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 110Bull's-Ey e his uncertain control of his t ongue a nd facia l muscles, so impor tant in speech, le d him to drool as he got excite d. The woman had returned to her position. She was seated be hind a small table which ha d a low wattag e bulb in a highly de corated but small lamp. The la mp had a translucent shade tha t gave the off-white wa lls an amber glow . The fort une telle r took in the attributes of her clients as a high quality priva te sleuth might observe a crime scene. As a ca mp sur vivor, Ruth also had hone d her skills of observation. Ruth noticed the g ypsy-like costume, the heavy make up on the fortune teller's face, the many c heap but hea vy rings. To the right of the entry was an overstuf fed chair, wi th the requisite black ca t reclining, methodic ally licking its right front paw. Its tail flicke d as if ticking off the seconds, as on a fus e that might lea d a bomb to explode. The ce iling wa s pressed tin. T he room was darkened by a padde d deep purple muslin curtain that hung over the pla te glass fr ont of the s tore. The whole shop was clea rly an ela borate stage set, but one quite imperfectly de signed. For s tarters there was the iPad wi th headphones on the table ne ar the lamp. A cell phone lay on a rather out of place fashionable l eather purse. The incongruities led R uth to realize this gypsy fortune teller had no mag ic. R ather, she had a sec ond persona. Noting the difficulty that Marc was havi ng articula ting his desires , Ruth tried to intuit the meaning of his ut terings for the fortune teller. \"He vod va nt you to tell his for tune to him.\" The gypsy wanna be took in her clie nt slowly. She w atched hi s spittle drip fr om the gray stubble on his chin. She looke d at his rigid upper tor so, his s eatbel t, and his untied left shoe. She took in the agita ted guttural sounds representing his diminis hed ca pacity to speak. She w atched a s his chest heave d, as the sweat bea ded on his brow. And she made up he r mind. \"Here, here ist ten dollars, ja?\" Ruth voluntee red as she opened her purse. B ut Ruth did not see the gypsy's grimace. She did not see the flicke r of anger fly across t he woma n's face as the money was mentioned, indi cating a deep a nd sudden aliena tion with this s taged role she repea ted for a living. \" Does dis make it den, ja? Ca n you do it?\" Stepping out of her role, no longer play ing a c entral Europea n Romani , out came a dense New York tirade, \"He don't need me to tell hi m his fuckin' for tune. He know s his futur e. Any one ca n see that. I don't sell people their own worst nightmares. Whadya bring him in for, lady? I gott a look in de mirror at night, lady. I ain't ha rd up. I got pr inciple s too. I 'm not some cheap whore on de street. Y ou take him ba ck oudda he re. You take back y our ten bucks and get him oudda my store.\" It was fast , and loud, but Marc absorbed wha t was an obvious refusal. A refusal of help, of knowledg e, of rebirth. As he took it in, it reverberated in his mind as an enormous explosion. He suddenly imagi ned seeing himself in a mirror: drooling in a whee l chai r. He saw, for an instant, what the blac k eye s of t his gypsy woman took in. A nd through thos e eyes he realiz ed his worst fears: his reality. He jerked at his joystick, a nd almost backed up i nto Ruth. The gypsy stood and opened the door. Marc's f irst thrus t for the door hit the fr ame, a nd chipped a piece of the wood to the floor. His hit was hard enough to rattle the window be hind the curtain to the left. The blac k cat le apt off the chai r into the darkened bac k of the stor e. Ruth picked up the ten dol lars and put it carefully back i n her purs e, trying to think of what this was going to do to her companion's self-confidence and wil lingness to s truggle for an improved futur e. Ruth stepped out of the shop and looked bac k toward Georgia A venue a nd then in the other direction, toward the E verett Building. Her mind was busy considering the knots in the net that had FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 111Bull's-Ey e been suddenly thrown ove r Marc's mind. Why had they g one into the store? Wha t had upset him so in fr ont of the Everett Building? Should s he bring up the gypsy in c onversation with Marc? Or would that threaten his condition? Preoccupied, she wa s no longer aside her companion. Marc was now in his whee l chai r about thirt y feet past the entrance to the Everett Building. He was going towa rd the bus s top. There a big elde rly woman w as carrying an ol d style canva s shopping bag w ith a woode n frame. She wa s standing in the pa th of the wheel c hair. She seeme d flushed red, and wa s staring intensely a t Marc. Vera ha d been w aiting for the J2 bus. She was carrying a shopping ba g lade n with groceries. The bus was r unning late . Since she couldn't read the bus numbers, s he had a sked a man w ho was also waiting for a bus t o tell her when the J2 arrived. But t he man ha d left on the 37 bus a few minutes ago, and now she was silently praying tha t someone would come to take his place. W as this man coming qui ckly i n a whe el cha ir the answer to her prayers? Was Jesus s till watc hing over her? The poss ibility made her feel all was right in the world. He stopped not far f rom her. She turned s o as to greet the man, and the n to make her request of aid. But as s he did so, she thought s he recogniz ed the face . It br ought up some very hostile urges. This invalid de finitely appe ared familia r and loathsome. Slowly her memories put t he puzz le together. He wa s that guy who stole her spoons . He wa s the prof essor . She turned so as to get a better look; she was sure it was him. Vera's fury welled up, a nd led to a righteous cal m. She had knowledg e that justice wa s on her s ide. She quick ly discounted the whe el cha ir as evidence of his diminis hed state. A scoundrel would use such paraphernalia to diminish s uspicion of his would be victims. How dare this thief show up here on the street after r obbing her? Did he intend to steal from her again? Disr egarding any evidenc e of the Prof essor 's handicaps, she lunged forward and l et out the banshee cry of the aggriev ed. Ruth, who w as still tr ying to coll ect her thoughts, suddenly was ale rted by the shriek. Ruth turned to s ee an unknown hea vy set woman, ta king off to attack Marc in the whe el cha ir. As s he moved, Ve ra was quite a sight. She had hurried out to catch the shuttle from t he Cl aridge House and had not repla ced he r slippers. As s he ran, one of her slippers f ell off and her thick, pow erful, lower leg s impelled her toward her prey. Her long g ray hair ca me undone in he r move, and wa s now flailing in the air. With memories of her fight with Ralph McBride at the school bike rac ks, Vera grabbed Marc's head a nd slapped him in the fac e. She y elled a nd her spit f lew onto his forehead. But by this time, Ruth had rea ched the w heel c hair and wi th all the strength of a loyal, but small dog a ttacking the foe of his mas ter, she s creamed for Vera to stop. She grabbed a t the arm that was str iking Marc in the face. V era swung at her new pint-s ized a ssailant with her other hand that still held her bag. The bag came down with a painful crunch on R uth's head. Stagg ering bac k, Ruth ca lled for a cop. R uth's scream carried down the bloc k, and into the e ar of Gladys who wa s panhandling a t the far corner of the Eve rett B uilding: he r mos t prof itable ve nue during lunch hour. Glady s had few equa ls when it came to elderly fighters and she moved in to protect her only friend in the Cha rter Hous e. Within seconds Gladys arrived. \"I told ya ta wa tch for thieves didn't I . Now move ba ck. I'll ge t her.\" But Vera was not about to go down. A mig hty swing of the shopping bag and Gla dys' knees buckled. She dropped to the ground. Her foes' defenders now 'taken out' Vera now set up to do in FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 112Bull's-Ey e her nemesis. Reac hing into the shopping bag she produced the prec ise item that had felle d the two champions of the invalid. She pulle d out her gun. \"Ah no ca n shoot me.\" cried Marc, with almost dece nt syntax. He lea ned on the whe elcha ir joystick and it lurched to the side. But shoot Vera could. And w ith neither her youthful eyesight, nor her s trong s ense of balanc e the bulle t sailed passed the chair, towa rd the entrance of the Eve rett Building. Who ca n fathom how it came about that the bullet's arrival should arrive so precisely timed with the exiting of Julia. W hen it entered her ca lf, blood pushed out of t he entry onto the str eet; blood flowed down he r leg and into her fabulous Guccis. Piece s of f lesh tore fr om the skin next to the exit hole. He r scream woul d have c urdled the milk in young mothers ' breasts. Only Ruth did not process the sounds well. With her ac utely diminished hea ring and with her focus on M arc, she had not followe d the sound, and never turned to see the unintended targe t. But she had taken i n the gun. Not since the ca mps had she s een a gun being shot so close to her. T he noise of the report sent feverish s hudders thr ough her frame. Julia fell to the ground. The fall and c ry of the more youthful and attractive blonde v ictim brought an immediate response from a rus hing police man, who g rabbed Ve ra. Vera, rea lizing tha t she had not yet destroyed her prey wa s not defens eless and bit deeply into the hand of the policema n who had g rabbed at her gun ha nd. He screamed a nd smashed his t runcheon on her head. Silent now, on the sidewalk, Vera w as handcuffed. As he rushed past t he falle n Gladys and he aded towa rd Julia, he ca lled for ambulanc es and police backup. Bending down to Julia's face, he said \"Don't move; you w ill be a ll right. You we re shot in the leg. It's a flesh wound. I don't think it hit a bone. You'l l be al l right. We're g oing to get you to a hospital.\" Julia wa s in s ubstantial pain but wa s very awa re that this policeman had save d her life. \"Thank you so much,\" she said in a w obbly drawl, too Texan for anyone native to Maryland. He he ld her head, a nd kept an e ye on his downed, handcuffed criminal up the str eet. \"Do y ou know why that woman w anted to shoot you?\" \"I have no ide a. I never saw he r before in my life.\" Marc had hea rd the cry, and turned to see Julia supine on the pave ment. Wa tching the policema n cradle he r head, he now knew he also had held he r head close. His past rus hed together as in a slow motion rewind of a movie showing a gla ss being unbroken. For reasons he couldn't fathom, he took satisf action that she wa s shot. And when hi s mother came to him, and hugge d him and said \"I vas so afraid. Come le t us leaf dis crazy plac e,\" he assented. Slowly , as was their wont, he rolled ne xt to her as s he wa lked. The we ather was cha nging. A wintry breeze was blowing in from t he North. The s ky wa s clouding over as they hea ded bac k toward Wonde rCare and the Charter Hous e, silently a nd privately una ble to come to grips with the storm that had destroyed their equilibria. The wails of police sirens came in from the East and the South, a nd those of t he ambula nces from t he North and the We st. FLOTSAM (OPPENHEI MER ) PAGE - 113 "}
