Ironically, this very success now threatens thedevelopment of better therapeutic modalities. Considerable controversy swirls over the ethical legit- imacy of placebo-controlled trials. This continues despitea 2001 note of clarification by the World MedicalAssociation about its revision in 2000 of the Declarationof Helsinki, stating that the use of placebos \"may beethically acceptable, even if proven therapy is available . . .where for compelling and scientifically sound method-ological reasons its use is necessary to determine theefficacy or safety of a prophylactic, diagnostic, or thera-peutic method\" (Declaration of Helsinki). Nonethe less, virtually all ethicists agree with Temple and Ellenberg(2000) that \"placebo controls are clearly inappropriatefor conditions in which delay or omission of availabletreatments would increase mortality or irreversiblemorbidity in the populations to be studied.\" The concept of equipoise provides the ethical under- pinning for the randomized clinical trial (RCT). Thisterm may be used, in the construct of Miller and Weijer(2003) \"as the full set of answers to the question, 'Whenmay a physician legitimately offer RCT enrollment to herpatient?'\" As originally described by Charles Fried in1974, equipoise required that an individual researcherbe genuinely uncertain about the relative merits of thetreatment alternatives in a clinical trial before offeringenrollment to a patient. Freedman (1987) later definedclinical equipoise as a state in which \"honest, profes- sional disagreement among expert clinicians about thepreferred treatment\" exists and leads to the institution ofa clinical trial \"with the aim of resolving this dispute.\"Both authors have sought to provide a sound moralframework for the RCT. The former assured satisfactionof the physician's \"duty of care,\" whereas the latteroffered guidance to guarantee \"overarching social approval\" (Miller and Weijer 2003) of the trial. (FE) andFreedman's clinical equipoise complement oneanother by addressing different aspects of moral concern.By satisfying the demands of the requisite fiduciaryrelationship between physician and patient, FE protectsindividual patients who are either potential or actualsubjects in clinical trials. This is critically importantbecause informed consent alone, while supporting theprinciple of patient autonomy as stated in the famousBelmont Report (1978), does not guarantee the protectionof human subjects. Many patients readily believe thatanything recommended by the physician is intendedfor their benefit (Levine 2003), a phenomenon termed by Appelbaum et al (1982) the \"therapeutic miscon-ception.\" On the other hand, CE meets the \"need of the state to protect its citizens fr om harm\" and provides guidance for institutional r eview boar ds. Thus, successful application of these principles can allow theethical completion of an RCT. Given the constraints and concepts cited above, is the conduct of placebo-controlled trials ethically justifiablein MS? I believe that neither a state of clinical equipoisenor adequate protection of patient safety exists to permitthe use of placebo controls for phase 3 trials in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). As a task force of the NationalMultiple Sclerosis Society concluded, a legitimate ex-ception would allow such trials for patients whorefuse currently available treatments or have failedtheir use (Lublin et al. 2001). However, in this cir-cumstance ethically proper recruitment of subjectsmay be too difficult to allow successful completion ofthe trial. Whether placebo controls may be utilized inshort phase 1 or 2 studies for RRMS is debatable.Clinical equipoise does exist regarding treatment ofpatients with clinically isolated syndromes and theuse of placebo controls is arguably permissible. Sim-ilarly, their use is ethically justifiable in both primaryand secondary progressive MS. ETHICAL ISSUES IN MS CLINICAL TRIALS A Miller Mount Sinai School of Medicine, Department of Neurology, New York, New York, USA ACTRIMS 2004 \u2014 Ninth annual meeting of the Americas Committee for Research and Treatment in Multiple Sclerosis T oronto, Ontario, Canada October 3, 2004 Page 1What options exist then for clinical trials in MS that will allow us to achieve the ethical social mandateto develop better treatments? Active control trials areone possibility despite the cautions about \"assay sen-sitivity\" (Ellenberg 2003). \"Add-on\" trials may be thebest cur rent approach for treatments whose mecha- nisms of action dif fer from those of existent therapy (Brody et al. 2003). The potential use of virtual controlgroups based on computer-modeling warrantsconsideration, but has not yet reached a state that isready for acceptance in a major clinical trial. The desire to achieve better treatment for MS is strong, yet the ethical requirement for the protectionof human subjects remains paramount. Only withacceptance of this principal and a firm commitmentamong the MS community to think \"outside the box\"will we succeed. A workshop addressing issues in MSclinical trials, sponsored by the National MultipleSclerosis Society to be held December 2004 in Wash-ington, DC, should be a major step in this direction.

It our previous observationsdemonstrating profound inter-individual heterogeneity,but intra-individual homogeneity in patterns of myelin desctruction (1). Earlyactive lesions have (OG) degeneration in the periplaque white matter (PPWM).Hypoxia may contribute to tissue injury in pattern IIIlesions (2). Differences in chemokine receptor expres-sion (CCR5/CCR1) between patterns II and III, suggestdistinct inflammatory microenvironments (3). To date, 286 MS cases All active lesions from a given patient continue todemonstrate the identical pathological pattern, suggestingthe presence of a single dominant effector mechanism ofdemyelination within that patient. The identification offour MS lesion patterns suggests MS may be a disease withheterogeneous pathogenic mechanisms. Furthermore, dis-tinct patterns may require different therapeutic interven-tions. Clinical and paraclinical correlates are needed inorder to differentiate between these pathological patterns. Critics suggest these observations may not be gener- alizable to prototypic MS since they may either reflectalternative diagnoses or represent atypical or exception-ally severe MS. A study of the clinical course of 91patients with pathologically confirmed inflammatorydemyelinating disease, however, indicates that patientsin this biopsy group are not unique. Eighty-two metPoser or McDonald criteria for definite/probable MS,whereas 9 patients had an isolated demyelinating syn-drome (IDS) at last follow-up (4). During the follow-upperiod, no patients had developed symptoms, or signsrevealing an alternative diagnosis. Clinical course of the82 definite/probable MS biopsy cohort was comparedwith the Olmsted County MS prevalence cohort (n /H11005 218). Although the biopsy cohort was on average olderand had a higher proportion of men, the clinical course was similar to the prevalence cohort, with comparableproportions of RR and SPMS. The frequency and type ofsymptoms prior to biopsy differed from onset attacksymptoms in the population-based cohort (motor 22% and sensory symptoms 36%vs. 56%). These less typical presentations may have inpart led to brain biopsy. Although both cohorts had thesame median EDSS at last follow up (3.0), the meanduration of follow up was much longer for the popula-tion based prevalence cohort. The biopsy cohort had amean of 1.65 EDSS points higher then the populationcohort after correcting for gender, age at onset, and dis-ease duration. However, 70% of the biopsy cohort hadan EDSS /H110884. Though a statistically significant differ- ence was found, the disability progression of the biopsycohort compared with the population-based cohort wasclinically less significant than expected. There was no correlation between disease duration pre- biopsy/autopsy, and the pathological pattern. However, asimilar distribution of patterns I, II, and III was present inpatients biopsied up to four years after disease onset, sug-gesting distinct patterns of myelin destruction appear topersist over a period of time (at least four years). There wasno correlation between immunopathological pattern anddisease course of prototypic MS, or EDSS at last follow-up. However, pathological analysis of the most severe vari-ants of inflammatory demyelinating disease, such as neu-romyelitis optica (NMO) and Balo's concentric sclerosis,have revealed that NMO is the most severe manifestationof Ab-mediated demyelination (5), whereas all patientswith Balo's concentric lesions have a DOD, and evidenceof hypoxia-mediated injury (6). A novel and highly spe-cific serological biomarker (NMO-IgG) has been identi-fied in NMO patients, which localizes to the perivascularregion in a pattern similar to the perivascular distribu-tion of complement activation and immunoglobulin dep-osition, as described in NMO lesions. This marker forthe first time reliably distinguishes NMO from otherinflammatory demyelinating disorders, including MS(specificity 91%; sensitivity 72%) (7). UPDATE ON THE INTERNATIONAL PROJECT ON PATHOLOGIC CORRELATES IN MS CF Lucchinetti Mayo Clinic, Department of Neurology, Rochester, Minnesota, USA ACTRIMS 2004 \u2014 Ninth annual meeting of the Americas Committee for Research and Treatment in Multiple Sclerosis T oronto, Ontario, Canada October 3, 2004 Page 3We have also observed a striking correlation between the therapeutic response to plasma exchange (PE) in MSpatients with evidence for antibody and complementactivation (pattern II pathology), versus no response inpattern I (n /H110053) or pattern III (n /H110056) cases (p /H110210.0001) (8). These observations suggest that pathologic hetero-geneity has therapeutic implications. We found no cor-relation between IgM/IgG antibod-ies and pathological pattern, disease course, PE response,or disease duration. Preliminary results suggest no asso-ciation between HLA DR or DQ carrier status or HLAhaplotypes, and MS patterns of demyelination, however,there is a trend towards HLA DR1 exclusively presentwithin patterns I/II. MRI-pathological correlates reveal that the accumula- tion of macrophages in a sharp border at the plaque edgecharacteristic of pattern I and II lesions, is highly asso-ciated with the presence of ring enhancement on Gd-MRIand hypointense T2W rims, whereas these imaging fea-tures are not seen in pattern III lesions (p /H110210.0001) (9). Review of follow-up MRIs from pattern III cases does notreveal evidence for ring enhancing lesions (n /H1100513 cases). Cross-sectional follow-up imaging of biopsied MSpatients suggest the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)of normal appearing white matter and cortex is higherthan normal. However, the ADC of pattern III patientswas statistically significantly higher than patterns I andII, for both NAWM and cortex (p /H110210.03). In the serial patients (n /H110056), the single pattern III patient showed marked increases in ADC values of NAWM, whereas theADC of NAWM of pattern I and II patients remained sta-ble. Although these ADC changes may reflect an inher-ent abnormality of the NAWM in pattern III cases, furtherstudies are needed to confirm whether these ADCchanges are primary, or secondary to differences in lesionload or lesion destructiveness. We conclude that the pathological findings and resultant new insights into the underlying pathophysi-ology of MS based largely on biopsied patients, can beapplied to prototypic MS. Furthermore, it would appearthat specific immunopathological patterns, with likelydiffering underlying mechanisms of CNS damage, areseen across a wide clinical spectrum of MS. The clinicaland radiologic observations reported to date on a largeseries of early MS cases continue to support pathogenicheterogeneity in MS, which persists over a period oftime, rather than a single mechanism dominating theformation of all lesions. The future will lie in studyingthe underlying immunopathological mechanisms in-volved in each pattern, determining the chronicity of thepatterns by identifying patients with longer diseaseduration prior to biopsy/autopsy, and developing pat-tern specific therapies and pattern specific serological,radiological, and genetic markers which reliably differ- entiate between these patterns. Beyond these accomplishments, the MSLP has accu- mulated an enormous resource of interactive investiga tors, invaluable research experience, and a carefully organ-ized tissue/clinical/radiographic/genetic database. Thisresource will uniquely allow investigators to directlydefine the pathogenetic role of MS susceptibility/severity genes on the development of the lesions, toevaluate the usefulness of paraclinical markers fordiagnosis and subtyping of MS patients and lesional stages, and potentially allow therapeutic interventionsto be more specifically tailored to lesion subtypes References 1.

The chemokines and theirreceptors exert well-characterized roles in inflammationand physiological function of the immune system, biological secretion, Campbell 1999; Gerard and Rollins2001). Chemokines act through plasma membrane G-protein coupled chemokine receptors on cellular targets(Luster 1998; Rollins 1997). Chemokines and theirreceptors have been implicated in various pathologiesof the human central nervous system (CNS) and haveemerged as salient targets for therapeutic intervention(Asensio Mennicken et al. 1999; Trebst and Ransohoff 2001). The current study addressed the expression of CC chemokine receptors (CC-CKR) on mononuclear phago-cytes in multiple sclerosis (MS). Two variables wereimposed on this characterization. First, we evaluatedCC-CKRs on mononuclear phagocytes in various stagesof lesion evolution. Acute MS lesions (less than 1 monthold) exhibit three major zones of demyelinating activity.In the inactive (IA) lesion core, myelin removed and myelin debris in macrophages islimited to neutral lipid (Lucchinetti et al. 1996). lesion edge, in zones, intra-cellular epitopes such as the MRP-14 isoform of theS100 family. In the intermediate late-active (LA) zone,only the abundant myelin proteins such as myelin pro-teolipid protein (PLP) are found in the intracellularinclusions of macrophages, which also may be demon-strated to contain the lipid-intercalating dye luxol fastblue (LFB). Based on our prior results, we hypothesizedthat monocyte recruitment to MS lesions could be ana-lyzed by focusing exclusively on the EA zones (Trebst etal. 2001). The further differentiation and activation ofthese cells could be monitored by evaluating the LA andIA regions of these acute lesions.Second, we compared mononuclear phagocyte CC- CKR expression in lesions exhibiting different patholog-ical patterns, as described by Lucchinetti, Bruck, andLassmann (Lucchinetti et al. 2000). This categorizationprotocol has been reported and recently reviewed (Lass-mann et al. 2001). Lesion patterns were defined by theseinvestigators, as described in Materials and Methods.EA, LA, and IA zones of demyelination were evaluatedin both lesion patterns. We found striking differences and informative similar- ities in our studies of CCR1 and CCR5 expression in pat-tern II and pattern III lesions. In EA zones of both patternII and pattern III lesions, infiltrating monocytes (located inperivascular aggregates and expressing MRP-14) expressedCCR1 and CCR5 in the majority of cells. This observationwas consistent with our previous report, which was con-fined to pattern II lesions (Trebst et al. 2001). Taken in thecontext of data from experimental studies using CCR1orCCR5-deficient mice, these data support a role for CCR1,and possibly CCR5, in the accumulation of monocytes inthe human CNS (Rottman et al. 2000). Regulation of CCR1 and CCR5 diverged when LA and IA zones of pattern II and pattern III lesions were com-pared. Specifically, percentages of CD68 /H11001cells express- ing CCR5 rose from about 30% in EA zones of pattern IIlesions to approximately 80% in LA and IA regions.This observation led to the logical conclusion that CCR5was maintained on infiltrating monocytes and upregu-lated on resident microglia in the lesional environmentof the pattern II pathology. By contrast, CCR5 expressiondiminished in LA and IA zones of pattern III lesions,from about 35% in EA zones to 25% /H1100630% in the older regions of these lesions. One possible interpretation ofthis disparity was that interferon- /H9253, known to upregulate CCR5 (Hariharan et al. 1999), was present at high levelsin pattern II but not pattern III lesions. Expression of CCR1 also differed. In pattern II lesions, as noted above, about 20% of infiltrating cells expressedthis receptor, but CCR1-immunoreactive cells werescarce (5% /H1100615%) in LA and IA regions. This finding was interpreted to indicate activation-related downreg-ulation of CCR1 and could be recapitulated of monocytes to serum-coated tissue cultureflasks (Trebst et al. By CCR1 wasIMMUNOLOGIC CORRELATES OF MS PATHOLOGIC SUBTYPES RM Ransohoff Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, Department of Neurosciences, Cleveland, Ohio, USA ACTRIMS 2004 \u2014 Ninth annual meeting of the Americas Committee for Research and Treatment in Multiple Sclerosis T oronto, Ontario, Canada October 3, 2004 Page 5expressed on a relatively uniform proportion of CD68/H11001 cells throughout all zones of pattern III lesions. The cumulative distinction between pattern II and pattern IIIlesions could be shown most clearly by calculating theratio of CCR5 /H11001cells/CCR1 /H11001cells in EA, LA, and IA zones of pattern II and pattern III lesions. In EA zones,the ratio approximated 1 in both lesion types, reflectingthe recent infiltration of CCR1 /H11001/CCR5 /H11001monocytes. This ratio remained unchanged in LA and IA zones of patternIII lesions, but rose progressively in pattern II lesions, asCCR5 was upregulated and CCR1 was downregulated. InLA zones of pattern II lesions, the CCR5/CCR1 ratio was10, and in IA zones, the ratio approached 20. CCR8 was expressed in a similar fashion in pattern II and pattern III lesions of MS (Trebst et al. 2002). In partic-ular, CCR8 was present on phagocytic macrophages patterns. We did notdetect CCR8 /H11001lymphocytic cells in MS lesions under any circumstances (Trebst et al. 2002). Among the lesion vari-ants of MS, patterns II and III exhibit differences definedby the mode of demyelination and the presumed inflam-matory mechanisms. We undertook to determine if thesedifferences were reflected at the level of chemokine recep-tor expression on mononuclear phagocytes. We foundthat patterns of chemokine expression were similar insome respects but dramatically different in others. What were the similarities? First, the infiltrating mono- cyte population in both lesion patterns appeared to and CCR5. Further, expressed byphagocytic macrophages activated microglia in bothlesion patterns. What were the differences? Most strikingly, the micro- glial population in pattern II lesions strongly expressedCCR5 in LA and IA zones, but not in the correspondingregions of pattern III lesions. Second, the number of cellsexpressing either CCR1 or CCR5 significantly changed inrelation to demyelinating activity of pattern II but notpattern III lesions. In conclusion, these studies support the hypothesis that lesional environments in patterns II and III differ, asreflected, for example, in CCR5 expression patterns, sug-gesting the presence of interferon-c in pattern II but notpattern III lesions. Additionally, the proposal that CCR1 /H11001/ CCR5S /H11001monocytes accumulate in MS lesions is sup- ported by these studies as this population was detectedin both lesion types.

ACTRIMS 2004 \u2014 Ninth annual meeting of the Americas Committee for Research and Treatment in Multiple Sclerosis T oronto, Ontario, Canada October 3, 2004 Page 6Featured Presentation MRI has been shown to be an exquisitely sensitive technique for the detection of multiple sclerosis (MS)plaques (1) and this has been confirmed in early (2) andsubsequent (3) MRI-pathological studies. Early studiesin the pathologic correlates of these focal MRI findingsattempted to relate specific histopathologic features tothese changes. However, it became apparent that thesechanges were not specific for pathology and that a vari-ety of histopathologic changes, either singly or in com-bination, can lead to the same MRI abnormality evidentas a focal lesion on the MRI scan (3). For example, thehyperintense lesions in T2-weighted imaging of MShave been attributed to demyelination (4), gliosis of the or macrophage of T1-weighted MRI have shown that\"black holes\" are markers of tissue destruction withaxonal loss (10). However, it is now apparent that someof these abnormalities are reversible, at least some prob-ably being remyelinated (11). Thus, before a given \"blackhole\" can be considered irreversible tissue destruction,a significant period of time should elapse. While the findings on routine MRI in MS have not proved to be directly translatable into specific histo-pathology, the patterns of intensity within lesions mayprovide important information with respect to the gen-esis and age of that lesion. For example, the imagingabnormalities seen at the periphery of a lesion may beindicative of the rim of macrophages at the edge of achronic active plaque (9,12), and alternating rings ofnormal and abnormal signal would be indicative ofBalo's concentric sclerosis variant of MS (13). The very earliest event in the pathogenesis of a focal lesion in MS is uncertain and this is true of its MRI cor-relate. The first change seen at the location of a futurelesion (which will later become apparent on T2-weightedimaging) is a focal abnormality on magnetization trans-fer imaging (MTI) (14). This can antedate the enhance-ment, normally evident as an early change in routineimaging of a new lesion, by quite some time, and itspathologic basis has not been determined. Enhance- ment, on the other hand, has been associated withinflammatory infiltrates (9,15) and neo-vascularization(16) in the lesion, MRI-pathology cor-relative studies. A number of non-routine techniques show promise for histopathologic specificity (17). The most obviousof these is magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).While no formal histopathologic correlative studieshave been employed with the technique, the specificityof this technique is implicit in as much as it representsan assessment of the presence, absence, increase ordecrease of a specific biochemical marker which maybe cell-specific. For example, N-acetyl aspartate (NAA)is a marker for axons and has been shown by MRS to bereduced in MS lesions (18), correlating with the nowwell-established finding of axonal loss shown inhistopathologic studies (19). Similarly, the lipid peaksin MS lesions most likely indicate lipid degradationproducts in macrophages engaged in the demyelinatingprocess (20). MTI shows promise of demonstrating his-topathologic features at various stages of plaque for-mation (21,22,23). The same is true of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (24), and diffusion tensorimaging elegantly displays tracts within the CNS,allowing for assessment of tractal Wallerian degenera-tion in MS (25). T2-weighted relaxation data can befractionated into several components, the shortest ofwhich, referred to as short T2 (26), correlates with thedistribution of myelin (27) and may prove to be a use-ful tool for following demyelination and remyelinationin MS patients. More recently, great interest has focused on the white matter not associated with MS plaques, the so-called\"normal-appearing white matter\" (NAWM). Techniquessuch as MRS (28) and DWI (29) have shown diffuseabnormalities in the white matter which appears normalby routine MRI techniques. Thin-slice MRI (30) andhigh-field strength magnets (31) have revealed verysmall focal abnormalities in the NAWM. Formal patho logic MRI CORRELATES OF MS PATHOLOGIC SUBTYPES GR Wayne Moore University of British Columbia and Vancouver General Hospital, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada ACTRIMS 2004 \u2014 Ninth annual meeting of the Americas Committee for Research and Treatment in Multiple Sclerosis T oronto, Ontario, Canada October 3, 2004 Page 7correlative studies have not been done to determine the basis of these findings. However, pathologic studies ofgrossly normal-appearing white matter have shownmicroscopic abnormalities, particularly axonal loss (32)thought to be due to Wallerian degeneration as a resultof axonal destruction in plaques (33). On routine T2-weighted and proton density studies, there is a subtle abnormality intermediate in intensitybetween plaque and the remaining NAWM (34). Thishas been referred to as \"dirty-appearing white matter\"(DWM). Preliminary data from our studies would indi-cate that in addition to axonal loss, there is a prominentloss of myelin in these areas of DWM (35,36). Thus, it would appear that in the future our under- standing of the histopathology and pathogenesis of agiven MS plaque may be determined by the superimpo-sition of data from a variety of MRI techniques, both rou-tine and those which at present are in the researchsphere. Moreover, MRI-pathology correlations of theabnormalities in non-lesional MS white matter (NAWMand DWM) may provide important insights into diffuseand probably degenerative processes in this diseasewhich up to recently was thought to be exclusively mul-tifocal and inflammatory in its pathogenesis.

ACTRIMS 2004 \u2014 Ninth annual meeting of the Americas Committee for Research and Treatment in Multiple Sclerosis T oronto, Ontario, Canada October 3, 2004 Page 9Featured Presentation Despite extensive clinical and experimental investi- gations on the genetics, immunology, imaging and clinicalinvestigations of the disease, fundamental questions stillremain over the etiopathogenesis of multiple sclerosis.There are many reasons for attempting pathologicalclassifications of multiple scler osis. First is the need to try to predict and control clinical behavior in patientsby trying to determine cases that are similar or differentin order to differentiate etiopathogenic comparisons onefrom the other. In the absence of a definitive etiology,much has to be inferred from the study of the extensivebody of experimental literature which has produced sim-ilar conditions in laboratory situations. This approachhas both practical and conceptual limitations, but doesyield some information as to what could be happeningin multiple sclerosis. Secondly, modern diagnosticimaging techniques have transformed both the clinicalmanagement of MS (9), and the potential to carry theseetiopathogenic inferences to a new level. The revival ofthe suggestion that MS is not a single homogeneousprocess has led to an attempt to develop a classificationof type and stage, which will be recognizable by non-invasive imaging techniques, and will enable tailoringtherapy to the individual patient. Classifications and staging systems also depend on delineating the state of progression of the disease.Classically the disease has been delineated into acute,sub-acute (acute on chronic) or chronic (10), but it isimportant to recognize that the definitions which governthe d esignation of each of these stages may vary. In this regard experimental evidence as to the progres- sion of similar inflammatory diseases has beenextremely useful (10). Recent work from the laboratoryof Prineas and Barnett have raised the suggestion thatthe progression of the disease may not show classicalinflammatory parameters early. This has led not onlyto questions as to etiopathogenesis, but as to the abilityto stage lesions. Nonetheless, MS is a disease withcommon neuropatho logical processes including edema, inflammation, axonal damage, demyelination, remyeli-nation and gliosis. Each of these plays a role in both the development and the resolution of the lesions, andeach will have a role in determining the clinical andradiological presentation. It becomes critical to incor-porate these elements in any common classification. Although most classifications of the disease has tradi- tionally relied on determining the temporal nature of theprocess, with the report by Luchinetti et al. (6,7), anattempt was made to determine the pathogenetic basisfor the disease by examining the various components oflesions seen at surgical biopsy and relating them toexperimental processes. While this approach has notbeen uniformly used, and may not be operant in all cases,an enormous amount of information has been generated(8), and has led to the delineation of various forms, withsuggestions as to etiopathogenesis. One of these includesthe suggestion that many of the changes are related tolocal changes in tissue blood flow. This idea has beenpicked up by Prineas and Barnett in their recent studyof what they postulate is the earlier stage of inflammationwhere the predominant lesion appears to be ischemicrather than inflammatory (1). Most of the current classifications and staging systems have not incorporated two very important features of thedisease that are increasingly recognized to have enormousclinical and diagnostic significance. The first of theseis the status of a normal appearing white matter(NAWM), which is increasingly found to play a signifi cant role both clinically, and also potentially in the develop- ment of new lesions. The second is the realization thatmany of the clinical and prognostic parameters of MSdepend on the degree and severity of axonal (2,4,5), aswell as cortical (3) pathology. Both these features needto be incorporated into common classifications and stagingsystems. Reliance on older concepts that cover onlydemyelination, remyelination and inflammation,exclude the utility of this most important aspect of thedisease. At the moment however, pathological classification, with attendant in vivo diagnostic imaging, remains of PATHOLOGIC CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS IN MS: WHAT IS THEIR SIGNIFICANCE?

However, the lack of certainty as to what thesechanges represent, together with incomplete pathologi-cal and clinical data will continue to impose limitationson their utility. A utilitarian approach in the future thatsearches for a classification based on pathological, clin-ical and radiological information will ultimately proveto be of more value. References 1.

Central to the future suc cess of stem cell transplantation in MS is the ability of trans-planted cells to migrate from the site of transplan tation to relevant foci of disease, while exhibiting remyeli-nating and trophic properties. A new approach to non-invasively assess how far and at what speed cells aremigrating is the use of MRI and magnetically labeledcells. Objectives: To assess the biodynamics of cell migra- tion of transplanted neurospheres and to correlate the dis-tance and speed of cell migration to the clinical diseasestatus. Methods: Newborn mouse neural spheres were labeled with iron oxide nanoparticles and BrdU. Chronic EAE wasinduced in mice by immunization with MOG peptide.Clinical scores were assigned daily. (Undifferentiated)stem cell transplantation was performed on day 6 follow-ing EAE induction in 8 mice, all of which underwent MRI.Serial MRIs, were performed in vivo using a 4.7 Tesla scan- ner. High resolution ex vivo imaging was performed at 9.4Tesla. The distance of migration was calculated from the3D MRI dataset, and validated by histology of BrdU- andPrussian blue (iron) positive cells. Results: Magnetic labeling did not affect differenti- ation of neurospheres into the oligodendrocytes 27/H110067%, and neurons 1.0 /H110061%. In vivo MRI showed that at days 1-2 after transplantation, cells were mainlywithin the ventricles. At 6 days (disease onset), cellsstarted to migrate along white matter tracts, with furthercontinuation at days 13-14 (peak first relapse) and 30(chronic phase). Most migration occurred early duringthe acute phase of disease. The clinical score demon-strated a good correlation between disease severity andmigration. The histological distribution of labeled cellswere found to match the MRI findings, with differenti-ation of cells occurring in vivo .Conclusions: The observation that the greatest degree of migration occurred very early in the course of diseasehighlights the narrow time window in which trans-plantation of remyelinating cells may be effective forobtaining clinical results. These results show thatinflammatory signals associated with the clinical scoremodulate migration in a positive manner. Disclosures: JWM Bulte has nothing to disclose.

WHITE MATTER ATROPHY CORRELATES WITH CLINICAL DISABILITY IN PATIENTS WITHPELIZAEUS-MERBACHER DISEASE J Laukka, J Kamholz and J Garbern Wayne State University School of Medicine, Neurology, Detroit, Keywords: to clinical disability in the acquired demyelinating diseasemultiple sclerosis (MS). Axonal degeneration occursduring acute attacks, associated with inflammation, andduring the chronic progressive phase of the disease inwhich inflammation is not prominent. To explore therole of interactions between oligodendrocytes and theiraxons in CNS demyelinating disease, we analyzed thebrains of rodents and humans with a null mutation inthe gene encoding the major CNS myelin protein,proteolipid the PlP1 null mice aswell as in the CNS of patients with a PLP1 null muta-tion, suggesting that disruption of PLP1-mediatedaxonal-glial interactions was the likely cause. Objectives: To extend these studies to patients with other PLP1 mutations, we analyzed the brains of anadditional 30 PMD patients by MRI. Twenty-five of thesepatients had one of a variety of PLP point mutations and5 had a duplication of the region of the PLP gene Methods: For each patient we measured total brain volume (TBV), white matter volume (WMV), mid-corpus callosal area, and intercaudate distance (ICD). In addi-tion, we calculated a functional disability score (FDS) for each patient which was developed specifically forthis purpose. ACTRIMS 2004 \u2014 Ninth annual meeting of the Americas Committee for Research and Treatment in Multiple Sclerosis T oronto, Ontario, Canada October 3, 2004 Page 12ACTRIMS 2004 \u2014 Ninth annual meeting of the Americas Committee for Research and Treatment in Multiple Sclerosis T oronto, Ontario, Canada October 3, 2004 Page 13Results: Comparison of the MRI and the functional data demonstrates that white matter volume decreaseslinearly with functional disability, suggesting thatdisability is the direct result white matter atrophy. Sinceintercaudate distance also correlates with the FDS, thissimple linear measurement must also be proportional towhite matter volume, and can thus be used as a substitutemeasurement when volumetric data are not available.Corpus callosal area also correlates with functionaldisability, but not as well as WMV or ICD. Conclusions: Taken together, these data demonstrate that white matter atrophy is the likely cause of neuro-logical disability in patients with PMD, regardless ofmutation type. In addition, they support the notion thatoligodendrocyte dysfunction is an important cause ofneurological disability in patients with MS. Disclosures: J Kamholz has nothing to disclose.

ANTI-MYELIN ANTIBODIES: FREQUENCY, STABILITY AND CLINICOPATHOLOGICASSOCIATIONS IN A BIOPSY Pittock1, (MBP) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein(MOG) are present early in MS and may be an earlypredictor of conversion to definite MS (MOG) ormarker for overall brain damage due to MS (MBP). Objectives: To report the frequencies of MBP and MOG antibodies in patients with biopsy proven demye-linating disease, and investigate their association withHLA DR genotype and immunopathological patternsand to ascertain their reproducibility over time. Methods: The biopsy cohort consisted of 71 patients with pathologically confirmed inflammatory demyelin-ating disease with adequate follow up, stored sera andDNA available for testing. Follow up and EDSS scoreswere ascertained by interview and examination, telephoneinterview and chart review.Results: 61 patients had MS and 10 patients had an isolated demyelinating syndrome (IDS). The mean dura-tion of disease was 6.3 /H110065.7 years with median EDSS of 3.0 (range 0.0-8.5). For MS patients, 23% had MBP IgG,39% 34% had MOG IgG and 61% hadMOG IgM. For 10 IDS patients with mean follow up of5.8 /H110064.9 years since attack, 1 had MBP IgG, 2 had MBP IgM or MOG IgG and 5 had MOG IgM in sera drawn atlast follow up. Clinical course and disease severity weresimilar for both seropositive and negative patients.Serial blood draws were collected in 4 patients, at 3 monthly intervals, 9-22 months after disease onset; 3 were positive for MOG IgM at some point in theircourse and subsequently became negative on at least 3serial testings. Similar changes were seen for the otherpostulated markers. Immunopathological classificationwas available on 51 of 71 patients; 11 pattern I, 29 patternII and 11 pattern III. MBP and MOG antibody seropositivitydid not correlate with immunopathological patterns.There was no association between seropositive status ofany of the antibodies tested and HLA DR hetero orhomozygosity. Conclusions: Frequencies of myelin antibodies in biopsy proven MS patients are similar to rates previ ously reported for prototypic MS. There was no associationbetween these antibodies and HLA DR status orimmunopathology. Although fluctuations in MOG IgMantibody status in patients with definite MS may reflectdisease activity, further longitudinal studies are needed todetermine whether this is a stable biomarker.

CXCL13 AUTOIMMUNE DEMYELINATING DISEASE BM Segal, L Bagaeva, P Rao and J Powers University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Neurology and Microbiology and Immunology, Rochester,New York, neuroinflammation Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis(EAE), are chronic, relapsing demyelinating diseases ofcentral nervous system (CNS) white matter. Histo logicallyand EAE are characterized by perivascular white matter infiltrates, composed of T cells, B cells and myeloidcells, within demyelinating plaques. We speculated thatthe formation of organized CNS infiltrates duringautoimmune demyelination might be governed bychemokines, such as CXCL13, that are normallyinvolved in the development of lymph node and spleenduring embryogenesis. CXCL13 is a lymphoid chemo-kine that attracts both B cells and a subset of T cellsbearing the CXCR5 receptor. Here we test our hypothe-sis that CXCL13 is ectopically expressed in the CNSduring EAE and drives chronic inflammation withinthe brain and spinal cord. Objectives: To investigate the role of CXCL13 in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Methods: EAE was induced in susceptible strains of mice by active immunization with myelin antigens or bythe adoptive transfer of myelin-reactive lymph nodecells. Representative animals were sacrificed at variouspoints during the clinical course and CNS CXCL13 levelswere measured by RT-PCR, RNAse protection assaysand/or Western blot analysis. In parallel studies, spinalcord mononuclear cells were analyzed by flow cytometricanalysis to detect CXCR5 /H11001leukocytes. The clinical course of EAE was compared in CXCL13-deficient andwildtype mice as well as in wildtype mice treated withneutralizing anti-CXCL13 or isotype matched controlantibodies. Results: We readily detected CXCL13 on both the mRNA and protein level in spinal cords from miceafflicted with EAE but not from healthy controls. CXCL13expression rose steadily throughout the course of relapsing-remitting disease. CXCR5 /H11001CD4/H11001T cells, bearing a memory cell surface phenotype, accumulated in spinalcords beginning with the first exacerbation. Blockade ofCXCL13 attenuated adoptively transferred disease. Consis-tent with these results, CXCL13 deficient mice experienceda relatively mild disease course characterized by anabsence of relapses. Conclusions: CXCL13 is ectopically expressed in the CNS during EAE and plays a pathogenic, non-redundantrole during the effector phase of the disease. Moststrik of CXCL13 relapses. Agents that block CXCL13 interactions might be amelio-rative in the treatment of multiple sclerosis or otherorgan-specific autoimmune disorders. Disclosures: BM Segal has nothing to disclose.

Yet, reconstructing the pathophysiologyof autoimmune disease with only auto-reactive alphabeta T-cells often only approximates aspects of theactual diseases, thus implicating a possible role for addi-tional components. For example, a disproportionatelyhigh percentage of gamma delta T-cells (up to 30% of thetotal number of T-cells) is found in brain lesions associatedwith multiple sclerosis (MS). Infiltration of gamma deltaT-cells is also observed in experimental autoimmuneencephalomyelitis (EAE). Objectives: Since gamma delta T-cells have the propensity to respond to self-antigens (such as non-classical MHC class I molecules T10/T22) and T10/T22mRNAs are found in the mouse brain, the goal of ourstudies is to find out the linkage between gamma deltaT-cells and CNS autoimmune disease. Methods: T10/T22 mRNA was detected by RT-PCR and protein expression revealed by T10/T22 specificantibody staining. In vitro disassociated myelinatingexplaints were generated from 12 BALB/cembryos. Mice expressing a transgenic G8 gammadelta T-cell receptor (TCR, specific for T10/T22) wereimmunized subcutaneously with complete Freund'sadjuvant (CFA) and adoptive transfer was performedby IV injection. Results: We show that T10/T22 are expressed on myelin forming cells; their recognition by T10/T22specific gamma delta T-cells induces demyelination.Importantly, the demyelination process can beblocked by of monomeric T22-beta2M.Furthermore, T10/T22 specific peripheral gammadelta T-cells are activated by injection; theirmigration to the central nervous system (CNS) ACTRIMS 2004 \u2014 Ninth annual meeting of the Americas Committee for Research and Treatment in Multiple Sclerosis T oronto, Ontario, Canada October 3, 2004 Page 14ACTRIMS 2004 \u2014 Ninth annual meeting of the Americas Committee for Research and Treatment in Multiple Sclerosis T oronto, Ontario, Canada October 3, 2004 Page 15induces CNS inflammation and motor dysfunction. Upon adoptive transfer to the na\u00efve syngeneic recip-ients, the in vivo pre-activated T10/T22 specific gamma delta T-cells alone are capable of inducing thepathology and clinical symptoms. Conclusions: The recognition of activation/infection induced self-antigens such as T10/T22 by gamma deltaT-cells may contribute to the initiation of autoimmunediseases. Thus, an important 'trigger' for autoimmunediseases such as multiple sclerosis may occur throughthe activation of peripheral gamma delta T-cells duringthe course of an infection.

PHASE TWO TRIAL OF FAMPRIDINE-SR IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AD Goodman1, JA Cohen2, T Vollmer3, M Johnson4, R Cohen4, A Blight4, and the Fampridine-SR Study Group 1University of Rochester, Department of Neurology, Rochester, New York, USA; 2Cleveland Clinic Founda- tion, Mellen Center, Cleveland, Ohio, Institute, Department of Neurology,Phoenix, Arizona, USA; 4Acorda Therapeutics, Hawthorne, New York, gait distur- bance; motor dysfunction; potassium channel blocker;timed 25 foot walk; weakness Background: Previous studies of the potassium channel blocker, fampridine (4-aminopyridine), in multiplesclerosis (MS) have reported improvement in variousaspects of neurological function including measures ofmobility and muscle strength. Objectives: This was a phase two, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial to evaluate thesafety and efficacy of fampridine-SR in subjects with MS. Methods: In this multi-center study, 206 subjects were randomized equally to one of four cohorts: fam-pridine-SR 10, 15, 20 mg bid or placebo. An initial placebo run-in period (2 wk) was followed by periods ofdose escalation (2 wk), stable treatment (12 wk), down-titration (1 wk), and follow-up evaluation (2 wk offdrug). Eligible subjects were ages 18-70 yr with MS (asdefined by McDonald) who had adequate cognitivefunction and could pe rform required study procedures, including a timed 25-foot walk twice (required range:8-60 sec). The primary efficacy variable was percentchange from baseline in average walking speed over 25ft. Secondary variables were Lower Extremity ManualMuscle Test (LEMMT), Ashworth Score, clinician'sglobal impression of change, subject global impression, 9 Hole Peg Test, Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test 3 /H11033, the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life Inventory, and the12-Item MS Walking Scale. Safety was assessed by moni-toring adverse events, changes in vital signs, clinicallaboratory test results, ECG, and physical examination. Results: In total, 195 subjects from all 4 groups com- pleted the trial: fampridine-SR bid 10 mg (n /H1100550), 15 mg (49), 20 mg (51), and placebo (45). The Timed 25-FootWalk demonstrated a significant effect for all dose groupscompared to placebo at the first visit after up-titration.There was a strong trend toward increased walking speedduring the stable dose period. LEMMT demonstratedstatistically significant improvement across doses at up-titration and during stable treatment (p /H110050.007). Addi- tional analyses of efficacy are ongoing. The adverse eventprofile was consistent with previous experience andincluded dizziness, insomnia, paresthesiae, and nauseathat were mostly mild to moderate in severity. Twosubjects receiving 20 mg bid experienced seizures duringthe trial, one from an accidental overdose. Conclusions: These preliminary results demonstrat- ing a strong trend on the Timed 25-Foot Walk, a statisti-cally significant increase in leg strength, and a favorablesafety profile support the continued investigation offampridine-SR in MS.

Methods: In these studies, we used the TMEV model of demyelination to test the hypothesis that vaccinationwith a coxsackievirus B (CVB)-based vaccine containinga PLP epitope and/or the coding sequence for inter-leukin-4 (IL-4) could redirect the immune response froma harmful Th1-dominated response toward a benignTh2-dominated response. Mice were i.p. vaccinatedwith 2 doses of 2 /H1100310 5TCID50 of the CVB vaccine either before or after TMEV infection. Results: Survival studies demonstrated that survival was not impaired by vaccination in the presence of TMEVinfection. Mice receiving the chimera containingPLP178-191 and IL-4 experienced a depressed delayedtype hypersensitivity (DTH) response compared withmice receiving the vaccine containing only PLP178-191(0.07 /H110010.02 vs. 0 /H110010.03 /H1100310 /H110022mm change in footpad swelling), supporting the hypothesis that the IL-4 contain-ing vaccine could reduce the cellular immune responsein animals receiving this vaccine. Mice receiving thePLP178-191/IL-4 chimera also had higher levels of PLP-specific IgG1 as determined by ELISA compared to micereceiving the vaccine containing PLP alone. IgG2a levelswere similar in both groups of mice. Conclusions: Together, these data demonstrate that this immunization approach can be used successfully tomodulate the self-reactive immune response in TMEV-infected mice. We are undertaking studies to assess the impact to these vaccines on demyelination. Disclosures: KM Drescher has nothing to disclose. Funding: No funding reported. COMBINATION OF PACLITAXEL AND VITAMIN B12CN ATTENUATES DEMYELINATION MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN PACLITAXEL ALONE IN AN ANIMAL MODEL OF MS FG Mastronardi and MA Moscarello The Hospital for Sick Children, Structural Biology and Biochemistry Research, Toronto, we described the effects of low dose paclitaxel (taxol) in attenuating diseasein a primary et al., 2002, Mult Scler 8:130) and in EAE models (Cao et al., 2000, J Neuroimmunol 108:103). These studies revealed a significant and modest sup-pression of clinical signs. Objectives: Determine whether combination of pacli- taxel and vitamin B 12is more effective in attenuating demyelination than paclitaxel alone. Methods: mouse received 4 pacli- taxel intraperitoneally once/week for four weeks. Controlsreceived phosphate-buffered-saline (PBS). 12 was given once/week intraperitoneally on a continuingbasis. Results: Consistent with the reduction of clinical signs, we found a reduction in astrocytosis, increasedmyelin basic protein (MBP) in white matter tracts, ultra-structural evidence of remyelination a reduction of MBPcitrullination. Decreased citrullination was due to areduction of peptidyl argininedeiminase (PAD) mRNAand protein in brain. In addition to stabilizing micro-tubules paclitaxel induces an increase in microtubulesin differentiated oligodendrocytes in culture. The en-hanced effect of the paclitaxel and B 12CN resulted in activation of endogenous interferon-beta in the brain ofND4 mice. Interferon-gamma expression was reduced inthe combination treated mice. Part of this mechanisminvolved the stabilization of STAT-1, an interferonresponsive transcription factor, by methylation.

MXA INDUCTION CAN BE REGAINED AFTER LOSS OF NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES WITHCONTINUED IFN-BETA TREATMENT PS Smyth1, A Pachner2 and J Oger1 1University of British Columbia, Medicine, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; 2UMDNJ\u2014New Jersey Med- ical School, first treatmentwith interferon-beta (IFN /H9252). Binding antibodies commonly used to screen for NABs; BABs usuallyprecede NAB development. With continuous treatment,/H1102260% of neutralizing antibody (NAB) positive patients on IFN /H9252-1b lose their NABs (Rice et al., 1999). a marker for IFN /H9252bioavailability, is consis- tently in the presence of persistent high titresof NABs (Bertolotto et al., 2003). It is unknown if MxAbioavailability re-appears once NABs disappear. Weexplored MxA responses in patients treated with IFN /H9252 /H110914 years, and compared past BAB, NAB status to the present. Objectives: To explore MxA response to IFN /H9252in MS patients who have lost their NABs over time. Methods: We measured MxA induction in lympho- cytes of MS patients who fulfilled the following criteria:continuous treatment with a single IFN /H9252preparation for /H110914 years with past BAB and NAB measurement. Con- trol groups included either MS patients receiving theirfirst injection of IFN /H9252or in the first 6 months of treat- ments with an IFN /H9252. Patients had BABs (ELISA), on 2 visits to UBC MS Clinic. Results: 32 patients participated in the study, 3 with- drew; 23 were female. Three patients with previouslyhigh NAB titres were now negative, with mean (SD)'present' MxA induction of 19.33 (6.36). This patients remaining NAB positive(n /H110056), 0.93 (1.64) and similar to the MxA induction of one long-term group (n /H1100512) never found to be NAB postive, MxA 24.10 (13.19). Control groups werepatients receiving their first injection of IFN /H9252and patients in their first 6 months of therapy (n /H110058), their mean MxA induction was 24.81 (18.92) that was similarto those patients NAB negative at present, regardless ofprevious NAB status. Conclusions: Some MS patients on IFN /H9252lost their NABs with treatment continuation and regained MxAinduction to IFN /H9252injection. Conversely, those with con- tinued high NAB titres continued to have no MxAinduction to IFN /H9252injection. Long-term treated patients, NAB-negative, continued to show good MxA induction.Further investigation is needed to confirm these find-ings, and to ascertain clinical outcomes.

Regulatingthe resting membrane potential might provide a directcontrol of the behavior of the OPC. We have identifieda potassium (K +) channel, Kv3.1, as an associated protein of oligodendrocyte specific protein (OSP)/claudin-11 via yeast two-hybrid assay. K +channel block and membrane depolarization adversely affectsOPC proliferation, migration and axon myelination,specifying K +channels in OPC OSP/claudin-11 is essential for forming CNSmyelin and testicular tight junctions. It is involved inproliferation and migration of oligodendrocyte pro-genitor cells (OPC) and is a candidate autoantigen inmultiple sclerosis. Objectives: Our objective in the present study was to establish the presence of Kv3.1 potassium channel, itsrelative contribution to K +conductance, its association with OSP/claudin-11 and its role in proliferation andmigration of OPC. Methods: combination methods Results: Blocking Kv3.1 specific currents or knocking out Kv3.1 gene decreased the sustained K +current com- ponent of OPC by 50-75%. OPC from OSP/claudin-11knock out mice had reduced K +currents indicating that the interaction with OSP/claudin-11 is important for K + channel function. Blocking Kv3.1 specific currents orknocking out Kv3.1 gene significantly decreased prolif-eration and migration of OPC. Conclusions: These results suggest that Kv3.1 cur- rents represent a significant component of outward K +conductance in OPC and Kv3.1 protein in associationwith OSP/claudin-11 is important in regulating OPCproliferation and migration, important processes formyelin formation, maintenance, and repair.

A DOUBLE-BLIND, RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED STUDY OF ORAL PIRFENIDONE FORTREATMENT are no proven treat- ments for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS)in stabilizing or reversing the neurological disabilitiesassociated with this disease. Pirfenidone, an orallyeffective small molecule, was found to be therapeu-tically beneficial in improving and stabilizing the dis-abilities in two independent open-label studies insecondary progressive MS. Objectives: We studied the effects of pirfenidone in a phase II double-blind, randomized, and controlled,clinical trial in secondary progressive MS for 12 months. Methods: Eleven (11/18) patients (61%) on oral placebo and sixteen (16/25) patients (64%) on oral pir-fenidone remained in the study for 12 months. Seven(7/18) patients (39%) in the placebo and nine (9/25)patients (36%) in the pirfenidone groups dropped outfrom the study. Results: The oral pirfenidone significantly (p /H11021 0.001) improved the Scripps Neurological Rating Scale(SNRS) scores as early as 3 months and the scoresremained improved for 6 and 12 months as compared tothe baseline SNRS scores of this group. In contrast, thebaseline SNRS scores of patients on oral placebo did notsignificantly improve at 3, 6 or 12 months of the study.In addition, the patients on oral pirfenidone had signif-icantly (p /H110210.05) higher rank in improved SNRS scores from their individual baseline scores than the patientson oral placebo at 3, 6 and 12 months. Oral pirfenidonewas also associated with a marked improvement in blad-der dysfunction in eight (8/16) patients (50%) as com- ACTRIMS 2004 \u2014 Ninth annual meeting of the Americas Committee for Research and Treatment in Multiple Sclerosis T oronto, Ontario, Canada October 3, 2004 Page 18pared to three (3/11) patients (27%) on placebo. In addi- tion, oral pirfenidone reduced the incidence of relapsesfrom five patients (45.5%) on placebo (12.5%) on pirfenidone (p /H11021 0.027). Other indices of MS such as EDSS scores, andmagnetic resonance imaging failed to reveal any statis-tically significant differences between the oral placeboand the oral pirfenidone. Conclusions: In view of the findings of the present clinical trial that oral pirfenidone significantlyimproved the clinical conditions (SNRS) of the second-ary progressive MS patients, a larger, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial is recommended.

EFFECT OF INTERFERON BETA-1A ON GREY MATTER ATROPHY PROGRESSION INRELAPSING-REMITTING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS R Zivadinov1, L Locatelli2, longitudinal; MRI; trial Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the centralnervous system (CNS) that involves most prominentlythe white matter (WM) of the brain. It has been demon-strated that substantial gray matter (GM) damage in thebrain occurs from the earliest stages of the disease. Tworecently concluded clinical trials showed that Avonex \u00ae (IFN beta-1a; Biogen, Inc., Cambridge, MA) slows downthe rate of brain atrophy progression in the second andthird year of the trial. However, more detailed informa-tion on the effect of this disease-modifying treatment(DMT) on the topography of CNS atrophy yet. Objectives: To determine whether Avonex \u00aeslows down progression of brain atrophy by reducing predomi-nantly GM or WM damage, or both. Methods: Thirty-one patients with MS have been included in the study and followed for 3 years. Theinclusion criteria were: relapsing-remitting (RR) MS, Expanded D isability Status Scale (EDSS) 0-5.5 and one exacerbation in the 12 months prior to study entry. At study entry, the therapy with Avonex \u00aehas been offeredto all patients. Fourteen patients started treatment with Avonex \u00ae, whereas 17 decided to delay the start of DMT and served as study controls. Both groups had quantitativecranial MRI scans at study entry and after three years,and standardized clinical assessments every 6 months.Brain parenchymal fraction (BPF), grey matter fraction(GMF) and white matter fraction (WMF) percent changeswere calculated using SPM99 software program. Results: Three patients in the control arm have been excluded from the study, because they started DMTbefore the study conclusion. Baseline demographic,clinical, and MRI measures were well matched betweenthe two study arms. None of the patients on Avonex \u00ae developed neutralizing antibodies during the study.Mean the Avonex \u00aetreatment arm. Both treatment groups developed similar amounts of WM atrophy over 3 years(p /H11005NS). Conclusions: The results of this preliminary study indicate that Avonex \u00aemay slow down brain atrophy progression preventing predominantly the developmentof GM atrophy.

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF HISPANIC PATIENTS WITH RELAPSING-REMITTING MS J Derwenskus, MJ Tullman and FD Lublin The Mount Sinai Hospital, Corinne Goldsmith Dickinson Center for Multiple Sclerosis, Neurology,New in Hispanics with a prevalence of 5-8/100,000 in Latin America. There isscant information regarding the clinical features of MSin Hispanic individuals. Objectives: To study the clinical and radiographic characteristics of relapsing-remitting (RR) MS in His-panics. Methods: We reviewed medical records of all His- panic and Caucasian patients seen for the first time at anacademic MS center in New York City during a 1-yearperiod. The diagnosis of MS was made according to theMcDonald criteria. Relapses were determined by historyor diagnosed prospectively while patients were followed.Fisher's exact test, unpaired t-test, or the Wilcoxon ACTRIMS 2004 \u2014 Ninth annual meeting of the Americas Committee for Research and Treatment in Multiple Sclerosis T oronto, Ontario, Canada October 3, 2004 Page 19rank-sum test were used to assess differences between the Hispanic and Caucasian patients. Results: Of the 79 patients diagnosed with RR MS, 9 (11%) were Hispanic and 64 (81%) were Caucasian.The 2 groups had similar age at onset, gender, type ofinitial demyelinating event, and length of follow-up.Although the mean number of relapses between the 2groups did not differ, the Hispanic patients had a signif-icantly shorter mean disease duration (4.2 /H110063.4 vs. 9.9 /H110068.1 years, p /H110050.024) and a higher average annualized relapse rate (ARR) (2.1 /H110062.3 vs. 0.8 /H110060.9 exacerbations per year, p /H110050.004) than the Caucasians. More ics (8/8, 100%) than Caucasians (38/62, 62%) met theMcDonald criteria for MRI dissemination in space (p /H11005 0.04). 67% and 73% of the Hispanics and Caucasians,respectively, were treated with a disease modifying agent(DMA) and the average duration of therapy was similarbetween the groups (22.2 /H1100620.5 vs. 23.0 /H1100620.3 months, p /H110050.92). After beginning therapy, the Caucasians had a 50% reduction in the ARR (0.8 /H110061.9 vs. 1.6 /H110063.0; p /H110050.14). The average ARR in the Hispanic group was nearly identical before and after (1.3 /H110060.9 vs. 1.3 /H110061.1, p /H110050.95) therapy was initiated. Conclusions: In this study, Hispanics had a signif- icantly higher ARR than Caucasians. Furthermore, a significantly greater proportion of Hispanics fulfilledthe McDonald criteria for MRI dissemination in space.After beginning treatment with a DMA, there was a 50%reduction in the ARR for Caucasians, while no changewas seen in the Hispanic patients. As the Hispanicpopulation in the US is expected to rise nearly 40% overthe next 15 years, there is a need for a large prospectivestudy of Hispanic patients with MS, including theirresponse to DMAs.

HERPESVIRUSES AS POSSIBLE ETIOLOGY OF MS D Koptides1, M Pantzaris2, T Kyriakides2, A Constantinou1, and C Christodoulou1 1The Cyprus of Neurology and Genetics, Molecular Virology, Nicosia, Cyprus; 2The Cyprus Institute of Neurology and remission; The hypothesis of viral infection in the etiology of MS has been investigated for several years.However, until today no single virus has been isolatedfrom tissues of MS patients. Objectives: We are These viruses are able toremain in latency in lymphocytes and have commonepitopes among them and probably with cellular pro-teins (i.e. myelin). These characteristics could be a keyin the initiation of an autoimmune mechanism, reap-pearing every time a virus is reactivated. We are inves-tigating samples of 100 MS patients for the presence ofviral DNA in serum, lymphocytes and CSF and viralantibodies in serum samples. Serum, lymphocyte andCSF samples are collected during the first MS attack andserum and lymphocyte samples during remission andrelapse periods. Comparison of viral presence will beperformed between three groups of samples. Methods: MS patients' samples as well as 20 CSF and serum samples from patients with other neurologi-cal disorders (OND) are under investigation. To detectIgG and IgM of herpesviruses ELISA kits are used withexception of HHV7 and HHV8 where 'in-house' proto-cols will be used. PCR reactions were standardizedusing 10, 100 and 1000 copies of purified viral DNA.PCR is followed by Southern blots for optimization ofdetection. Results: Herpesvirus DNA was detected in 36 out of 50 CSF first attack MS samples analyzed so far. The mostfrequent viral DNA is HSV1 DNA found in 13 samplesfollowed by EBV DNA in 9 samples. All herpesviruses,with the exception of HHV8, are present in the 50 MSCSF samples. The viral DNA presence in the serum islower than in CSF. HSV1 DNA is present in 8 patients(CSF and serum) but 5 more patients have HSV1 DNAonly in CSF. In the control group only 2 serum and noCSF samples are positive for viral DNA. IgG antibodydetection of 5 viruses in 100 first attack MS samples and20 OND controls do not show significant difference. Theprevalence of IgM is 7% in the control group and 16%in MS patients. Conclusions: Although these results are only prelim- inary and the number of patients is small, we canobserve a significant difference of viral presencebetween MS and control samples. This difference couldcorrespond to an acute infection coexisting with thesymptoms of the first MS attack. Disclosures: D Koptides has nothing to disclose.

TheValine66Methionine (V66M) investigate the associations the Methods: Six R-NMO patients and 71 RR-MS patients enrolled in 3 separate studies were evaluatedusing the EDSS and MRI. The V66M genotype wascharacterized using discrimination. Results: Five patients (83.3%) the were (5.6%) patients were M66M, which is similar tothe distribution in a control population. Despite thesmall sample size, the frequencies of the V66V, V66Mand M66M genotypes in /H110050.039). Fur- ther assessments betweenoptico-spinal MS presentation and the V66M polymor-phism are underway. Long term quantitative MRI data,available for a subset of RR-MS patients, is being ana-lyzed to determine the associations between genotypeand MRI parameters.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that V66M poly- morphism is associated with R-NMO but not withsusceptibility to RR-MS. In RR-MS, this polymorphismmay be associated with disease course. These findingsrequire confirmation in a larger cohort but the BDNFgenotype shows promise in distinguishing between thedifferent types of demyelinating diseases.

PARTIAL TRANSVERSE MYELITIS RATETO TF Scott1, S Neurology, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA; 2Allegheny General Hospital, Neurology, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, resonance imaging; prognosis;transverse myelitis Background: To date, there have been only a few long-term follow-up studies that have addressed theissue of conversion from APTM to CDMS in patientswith initially normal cerebral MRIs. Objectives: To determine the long-term risk of devel- oping clinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS) inpatients with acute partial transverse myelitis (APTM). Methods: We studied 30 consecutive patients with clinical evidence of APTM. Patients with symmetricsevere acute transverse myelitis were considered to havecomplete transverse myelitis and were Allpatients underwent spinal and cerebral MRIs, 13 under-went cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, and 11 patientsunderwent evoked potential studies. Various other studieswere performed to assess for connective tissue diseaseand causes of acute partial transverse myelitis other thandemyelinating disease. Results: After an average follow-up of 61.1 months, all laboratory and clinical evidence, including relapsehistory, indicated that 3 patients developed lesions oncerebral MRI and could be classified as CDMS by eitherPoser criteria (2 patients) or MacDonald criteria (1patient). Relapses limited to the spinal cord clinicallywere seen patients. patient transitioned ACTRIMS 2004 \u2014 Ninth annual meeting of the Americas Committee for Research and Treatment in Multiple Sclerosis T oronto, Ontario, Canada October 3, 2004 Page 21to CDMS. Unifocal lesions of the cord were seen in 19/30 (63%) patients, multifocal lesions were seen had negative MRIs. The 3patients who converted to CDMS did so within 5 yearsof the onset of myelitis. Conclusions: APTM with normal cerebral MRI had a low rate of conversion to CDMS in this long-term study.The presence of oligoclonal bands in several patientswho have yet to develop evidence of cerebral demyeli-nation may indicate a limited utility for this test inpatients with APTM.

PREDICTING FACTORS OF INITIAL DEMYELINATING EVENT (IDE) SEVERITY ANDRECOVERY T West1, E Waubant1, (ON), brainstem and/or cerebellardysfunction. Baseline demographic, clinical and MRIcharacteristics may predict severity and recovery fromIDE, and time to subsequent MS onset. Such predictorscould guide patient management. Objectives: To 1) characterize a cohort of patients followed prospectively from IDE onset, 2) determinewhich baseline demographic, clinical and MRI char-acteristics predict IDE severity and recovery. Methods: Data on all UCSF MS Clinic patients seen within 6 months of IDE onset was entered prospectivelyinto an ACCESS database. Scores on EDSS, FunctionalSystems (FSS) and visual acuity (VA) were used todefine IDE severity shortly after onset and recovery over6 months. Severity of IDE was defined as mild /H11005FSS 0-1 or VA /H1109120/40, moderate /H11005FSS 2 or VA 20/50- 20/190, severe /H11005FSS 3 and more, or VA /H1102120/200. Recovery 6 months afterwards was defined as complete/H11005FSS 0 or VA 20/20, fair /H11005FSS 1 or VA better or equal to 20/40, poor /H11005FSS 2 or more, or VA of 20/50 or worse. Results: We identified 119 such patients (84 women) with an average onset age of 34 /H1100610 years, 58 of whom received IV methylprednisolone at the time of onset. IDEwas monosymptomatic in 105 patients (51 spinal cord, 31 brainstem, 4 cerebellar, 19 ON), and polysympto-matic in 14. Onset severity was mild in 46%, moderatein 47%, and severe in 7%. Recovery was complete in46%, fair in 49%, and poor in 4% of patients. Averageage, sex ratio and ethnicity were similar across groupsof various severity and recovery. Patients with mild IDEwere more likely to fully recover than patients withmoderate or severe IDE (Fischer's exact test, p /H110210.005). Patients with polysymptomatic presentations were morelikely to have a worse recovery regardless of onsetseverity (Fischer's exact test, p /H110210.005). Conclusions: Explanatory variables including MRI that are potentially predictive of the severity and recov-ery of IDE, and time to second episode will be tested inunivariate and multivariate models. This preliminarywork has resulted in an ongoing international effort thatwill merge data on patients seen prospectively since IDEonset to expand our findings. DNA will be collectedfrom these patients to determine if specific genetic poly-morphisms predict IDE severity, recovery and time tosubsequent exacerbation.

THERAPY OF RELAPSING EAE BY NEUTRALIZATION OF LYMPHOCYTECHEMOATTRACTANT CYTOKINE IL-16 University, Neurology, Detroit, Michigan, USA; 2University of Colorado, Computer Science, Denver, Colorado, USA; 3Wayne State University, Anatomy and Cell Biology, Detroit, Michigan, USA; 4Boston University, Pulmonary Center, precedes onset and relapses of experimental auto-immune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We reported that (B6/H11003SJL) F1 (H-2b/s) mice, with severe relapsing-remitting disease, had extensive infiltration by CD4 /H11001T cells compared to C57BL/6 (B6) (H-2b) mice, myelinoligodendrocyte peptide 35-55 (MOG35-55). Objectives: This observation led us to search for mechanisms that specifically regulate trafficking of ACTRIMS 2004 \u2014 Ninth annual meeting of the Americas Committee for Research and Treatment in Multiple Sclerosis T oronto, Ontario, Canada October 3, 2004 Page 22CD4/H11001T cells in relapsing H-2b/s mice. We found that the CD4 /H11001cell chemoattractant cytokine IL-16 has an important role in regulation of relapsing EAE. Methods: We analyzed levels of IL-16 and identified sources of IL-16 immunoreactivity in CNS throughoutrelapsing-remitting disease. Finally, effects of IL-16 antibody on clinical and patho-histology of relapsing disease were evaluated. Results: We found that production of IL-16 within the CNS of mice with EAE correlated well with theextent of CD4 /H11001T cell and B cell infiltration during acute and relapsing disease. In the CNS IL-16 was producedby infiltrating CD4 /H11001T cells, B cells. Treatment anti-IL-16 antibody success-fully reversed paralysis and ameliorated relapsing dis-ease. In treated mice, diminished infiltration by CD4 /H11001 T cells, lesser demyelination and more sparing of axonswere observed. Conclusions: We show an important role of IL-16 in regulation of relapsing EAE and describe a novel thera-peutic approach to specifically impede CD4 /H11001T cell chemoattraction in EAE, by neutralization of IL-16. Ourfindings have high relevance for the development ofnew therapies for relapsing EAE and potentially MS. Disclosures: DS Skundric has nothing to disclose. Funding: No funding reported. ANTI-GLATIRAMER ACETATE ANTIBODY LEVELS IN TREATED MULTIPLE SCLEROSISPATIENTS J Oger, E Gibb, E Basile and T Aziz University of British Columbia, Medicine, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada Keywords: enzyme PWM Background: Previously, GA has been shown to induce antibodies in up to 100% of treated patients.These antibodies have also been shown to peak at month3, but gradually decrease, and over time return to pre-treatment levels. Objectives: To study the kinetics of anti-GA antibod- ies in treated MS patients. Methods: In a randomized, double-blinded placebo controlled study, we analysed the kinetics of anti-GAantibodies, and also both in vitro and in vivo total IgG levels in 16 GA treated and 9 placebo patients. Serumsamples and PBMCs were collected pretreatment and every 3 months thereafter, for up to 36 months. Anti-GAantibodies were measured using a direct ELISA method.Serum IgG were measured using nephelometry. PBMCswere cultured for 7 days with and without pokeweedmitogen (PWM), and secreted IgG measured by ELISA. Results: All placebo patients (n /H110059) tested negative for anti-GA antibodies. In the treated group, all patients(n /H1100516) were negative having a mean value of 0.19 /H11006 0.03 OD for anti-GA antibodies at pretreatment, butbecame positive at month 1, peaking at month 3 (1.64/H110060.37 OD), and remained so for the duration of the study (36 months). The difference between pretreatmentand during treatment was significant (p /H110210.005) throughout the study. Serum IgG levels did not differsignificantly between treated and placebo patients.Spontaneous (without PWM) IgG secretion levels wasnot different between placebo and treated patients.However, within the treated patients there was a signif-icant increase in spontaneous IgG secretion immuno- modulatory drugs, is highly immunogenic. Antibodiesto GA peaked at month 3, as shown in other studies andremained elevated for at least 3 years. The clinicalsignificance of these antibodies needs to be explored.The fact that spontaneous IgG secretion increases intreated patients probably indicates a switch from a TH1to a TH2 response.

It is widely depicted as a prototype of Th1-mediated organ specificautoimmunity. In this study, we analyzed the cytokineprofile of myelin-specific T cells from lymph node,spleen and CNS during EAE on the single cell levelusing a highly sensitive Elispot assay. Objectives: To analyze the cytokine repertoire of myelin-reactive T cells in the CNS dur-ing on lymph nodecells, splenocytes and spinal cord mononuclear cellsharvested from mice with detail. Results: Our studies demonstrate that the myelin- specific T cell repertoire is more diverse than previouslyportrayed, with comparable numbers of IL-4, IL-5 andIFN-gamma producers detected in lymph nodes andspleen. Two color fluorispot analysis revealed that IL-4/IL-5, and IFN-gamma were secreted by distinct sub-populations. By contrast, cells isolated from the in-flamed CNS represent uniform population, exclusivelysecreting IFN-gamma. the CNS EAE such as MIP1alpha, SLC and RANTES. Conclusions: Our studies suggest that EAE should be classified as a Th1-mediated disease based on the bio-logical functions of the effector cell population withinthe target organ as opposed to in the periphery. Th1skewing occurs within the CNS at least in part due topreferential recruitment/retention of IFN-gamma pro-ducers in response to locally produced chemokines.

Objectives: The primary objectives of the present study were to examine PM in MS patients and evaluatewhether an \"implementation intentions\" mnemonic thathad been effective in healthy elderly would improve PMin MS patients. Methods: Participants with MS and without MS (controls) played a board game, mimicking a week ineveryday life, which included 59 PM tasks. Participantswere tested on noticing when actions were to be com- pleted and on remembering the particular actions. Half the participants formed implementation intentions (e.g.,stating \"I intend to pick up my niece at 3 pm\" and pic-turing themselves picking up the niece) and half rote-rehearsed. Results: Preliminary results are based on data from 24 adults with relapsing-remitting or secondary progres-sive MS (11 females, 13 males; age 25-58; mean educa-tion 15.0 yr) and 15 without MS (controls; 7 females, 8males; age 25-57; mean education 15.8 yr). Adults withMS were significantly less successful on the PM tasksthan the controls, both in terms of noticing when actionswere to be completed and remembering the particularactions. Among participants with MS, implementationintentions did not improve PM performance on thegame as a whole, although it slightly improved perform-ance on the final round of the game. People who wereolder, had higher EDSS scores, or had lived with MSlonger did more poorly on the PM tasks. Participants ACTRIMS 2004 \u2014 Ninth annual meeting of the Americas Committee for Research and Treatment in Multiple Sclerosis T oronto, Ontario, Canada October 3, 2004 Page 24had relatively good awareness; those who rated them- selves better on PM in everyday life tended to demon-strate better performance. Conclusions: People with MS had more difficulty performing PM tasks than did controls. Clinicians canexpect that MS patients who are older, have higherEDSS scores, or have had MS longer will experiencegreater difficulties with PM tasks, and patients are likelyto be aware of their deficits. It is possible that the imple-mentation intentions mnemonic may be helpful to somepeople with MS, with extended practice. Disclosures: DM Clawson has nothing to disclose.

COGNITIVE STATUS AFTER 10 YEARS OF PROSPECTIVE EVALUATION IN PATIENTS WITH RELAPSING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS SR Schwid1, AD Goodman1, Rochester, Biostatistics and Neurology, Rochester, New York, study of glatiramer acetate (GA), improvements occurred in neuropsychologicaltest scores during two years of treatment regardless ofwhether patients received GA or placebo, likely due topractice effects. Because most of the patients originallyenrolled in this study are still being followed in an open-label study 10 years after baseline testing, we had anopportunity to reassess neuropsychological functionafter a much longer period, when it is more likely tohave changed. Objectives: The primary objectives were to assess long-term changes in neuropsychological status follow-ing 10 years of prospective evaluation and to determinewhether baseline characteristics and changes in neu-ropsychological function after 2 years predict long-termchanges. Methods: Participants in the pivotal trial of GA repeated the Brief Neuropsychological Battery of Neu-ropsychological Tests an average of 10.6 /H110060.4 years after their initial baseline evaluation.Results: Demographics and baseline cognitive test scores were similar for the subset of patients who werere-evaluated (n /H11005153) compared to those who were not evaluated (n /H1100598). On average, tests of memory and semantic retrieval showed stable function over 10 yearsof follow-up, but tests of attention showed declines forthe group as a whole. Using a threshold of a 0.5 SDdecline to define significant worsening, individual testsshowed declines in 27-49% of participants and a com-posite score showed worsening in 19%. After 10 yearsof follow-up, there were minimal cognitive differencesbetween those who were originally randomized to beginGA immediately or to delay treatment for 2-3 years.Controlling for age, gender, and education level, cogni-tive tests tended to worsen more in participants withlower baseline cognitive test scores and higher EDSSscores. The change in cognitive test scores during thefirst 2 years of observation was predictive of 10-yearchanges. Conclusions: Most patients with relapsing MS had stable cognitive performance during 10 years of prospec-tive evaluation. Patients with impairment at baselineand interim evaluation were the ones most likely toworsen during extended follow-up. The overall groupstability may reflect benefits of immunotherapy, butconclusions are limited by an incomplete understandingof the natural history of cognitive impairment in MS.

RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL OF AN ENERGY CONSERVATION COURSE FORPERSONS WITH MS VG Mathiowetz1, KM Matuska2and M Finlayson3 1University of Minnesota, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA; 2College of St. Catherine, Occupational Therapy, St. Paul,Minnesota, USA; 3University of Illinois at Chicago, Occupational Therapy, Chicago, Illinois, USA Keywords: energy conservation strategies; fatigue; quality of life; randomized clinical trial; self-efficacy;work Fatigue is a common and very dis- abling symptom for persons with MS. The MS Councilfor Clinical Practice Guidelines, 1998, on Fatigue and ACTRIMS 2004 \u2014 Ninth annual meeting of the Americas Committee for Research and Treatment in Multiple Sclerosis T oronto, Ontario, Canada October 3, 2004 Page 25MS reported that teaching energy effectiveness (conser- vation) strategies was a well-established practice butthere was no scientific evidence to support its efficacy. Objectives: To assess the short-term efficacy and effectiveness of six-week energy conservation (EC)course by Packer et al., 1995, on fatigue impact, qualityof life, and self-efficacy for persons with MS. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 169 persons with MS were randomly assigned to an imme-diate intervention group or a delayed control group usinga crossover design. The outcome measures: FatigueImpact Scale, SF-36 Health Survey, and Self-Efficacy forPerforming EC Strategies were measured before and afterEC course and no intervention periods. Data wereanalyzed from intent-to-treat and compliers methods. Results: A mixed effects analysis of variance model determined that when individual subscales were ana-lyzed separately, seven out of nine Fatigue Impact Scaleanalyses were decreased significantly (p /H110210.05/3) and six out of nine SF-36 analyses expected to change weresignificantly increased (p /H110210.05/8). The secondary outcome, Self-Efficacy for Performing EC StrategiesAssessment increased significantly (p /H110210.05) post- course compared to pre-course. Conclusions: Results support the efficacy and effec- tiveness of the EC course to decrease fatigue impact, andto increase self-efficacy and some aspects of quality oflife. This EC course taught by occupational therapist isa legitimate non-pharmacological approach for managingfatigue for persons with MS. Disclosures: VG Mathiowetz has nothing to disclose.

ASPARTOACYLASE IS EXPRESSED PREDOMINANTLY IN OLIGODENDROCYTESAND IS DECREASED IN MS PLAQUES D Hristova, J Kamholz and J Garbern Wayne State University School of Medicine, Neurology, Detroit, in high concentrations in neurons in the central nervoussystem. Because of its abundance and relative cell speci-ficity, measurement of NAA levels by magnetic reso-nance spectroscopy (MRS) has become a common toolfor the analysis of neuronal pathology in patients with avariety of neurological diseases, including multiplesclerosis (MS). The steady-state level of NAA reflects thebalance between NAA synthesis and causes theleukodystrophy, also be involved in myelination. Consistent withthis notion, previous experiments have demonstratedthat NAA can donate acetyl groups to myelin lipid. Objectives: To investigate further the regulation of NAA synthesis and breakdown, we produced a rabbitpolyclonal antibody to a region of the aspartoacylaseprotein, and used it to analyze ASPA expression in bothmouse and human CNS. Methods: Aspartoacylase expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry of brain sections and oligo-dendrocytes in culture as well as by Western blotting ofbrain and cell protein extracts. Results: We find ASPA expression mainly in differ- proteins or adenomatosis polyposis coli (APC)protein, both in intact brain and in primary cultures ofmouse oligodendrocytes. This observation supports thepossibility that neuronally produced NAA can serve asa substrate for myelin lipid and protein synthesis. Inaddition, analysis of tissue from the brains of severalpatients with MS demonstrated decreased ASPA expres-sion within the plaque area, probably the result ofreduced numbers of oligodendrocytes. Conclusions: Therefore, reduced white matter NAA levels in MS patients, measured by MR spectroscopy areprobably due, at least in part, to a reduction in NAA syn-thesis rather than an increase in NAA hydrolysis. Thetransient reductions reported in patients with MS likelyare the consequence of more subtle disturbance in axo-glial interactions. Disclosures: J Garbern has nothing to disclose.

While relapse is clearly a function of inflamma-tion, the mechanism of progression is less clear. Thisstudy investigated the role of glucose metabolism in pro-gression. On the basis of findings linking abnormalpolyol metabolism to white matter disease and to MS,we hypothesized that progression is in part mediated byan increase in glucose metabolism by the astroglialpolyol pathway. Objectives: To differentiate relapsing-remitting (RR) from secondary progressive (SP) types on the basis ofcerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose metabolites, particu-larly polyol pathway polyol metabolites of glucose\u2014as well as myoinositol, glucose, and lactate in premortem CSF and plasma samples from 100 patients and 12healthy controls. 25 samples each came from patients designated as RR in remission; RR in relapse; SP; and SPwith glucose/lactate to measure glucoseand metabolites. Comparisons were made with nonpara- metric statistics with alpha adjusted to p /H110210.005 for multiple tests. Results: SP patients had significantly elevated CSF glucose and lactate levels compared to RR patients, irre-spective of current clinical state (medians /H1100564.2 vs. 57.2 mg/dl and 1.74 vs. 1.52 mmol/l, CSFglucose and lactate levels did not correlate significantlywith IgG index, CSF albumin, or CSF cell counts. Incomparison to healthy controls, both types had signifi-cantly elevated CSF sorbitol and plasma lactate. Con-trary to our hypothesis, types did not differ in terms ofCSF polyol pathway metabolites. Conclusions: Our results suggest that CSF metabolic profiles are abnormal in MS and differentiate RR and SPtypes. Elevated CSF sorbitol indicates increased metab-olism of glucose by the polyol to glycolysis\u2014in types. CSF accumulationof lactate\u2014the neuronal substrate for aerobic glucosemetabolism\u2014in SP patients is consistent with impairedmitochondrial glucose metabolism\u2014an already postulatedmechanism of MS progression. These CSF findings andthe elevated plasma lactate in both types warrant furtherstudy to determine their significance for energymetabolism and potentially for fatigue in MS.
