They are characterized by creative bursts of energy, immense curiosity about the self and the world, sudden changes in the physical, emotional and social dimensions and expanded need for communication. They are also periods of grappling with an identity crisis, feelings of isolation, anxiety, alienation and confusion. Each individual is unique with inherent positive attributes and latent potential and it is the responsibility of the school to provide opportunities for young talent to blossom and flourish. The biggest killer in the world today is not war, disease or natural calamity. It is life style related diseases. Health is an important component of the concerns regarding adolescent issues. Obesity, lack of physical activity and exercise, mental and emotional stress are major concerns. The experiences gained as children often stay with us throughout life. Therefore there is a need to create health oriented school climate so that appropriate ambience is created which is sensitive to the health needs of school going children and helps to promote their well being. The new millennium schools must provide a setting where in education and health programmes come together to create a health promoting environment which in turn promotes learning. It must constantly strengthen its capacity as a healthy setting for learning and preparing for life. Such schools use its full organization potential to promote health among students, staff, families and community members. Schools need to provide a safe healthy environment which includes safe, clean water and sufficient sanitation facilities, freedom from abuse and violence, a climate of care, trust and respect, social support and mental health promotion. The school can work in the areas of Food and Nutrition, Knowing Your Body, Personal, Environmental Hygiene and Sanitation. Behaviour and Life Skills, Physical Fitness and Being Responsible and Safe. The Manual provides guidelines to all stakeholders including managers, principals, teachers and students. There are activities designed for different levels in the different volumes of the Manual. The first part of the Manual recommends setting up of a Health ans Wellness Club to further carry on these enrichment activities within the school. The ultimate objective of the Manual is to involve the school going child in making healthy life style choices. The Comprehensive School Health Manuals are an outcome of the collaborative effort of CBSE along with the guidance provided by WHO India. The Manuals would not have been possible but for the effort and support provided by the material production team. I would also like to thank Dr. Sadhana Parashar, Head (Innovation & Research) and Mr. Pramod Kumar T .K., Asst. Education Officer, CBSE for coordinating and editing the Manual. There are four volumes in the package. The First volume is Introductory and the other three consist of graded activities for each level : Primary, Upper Primary and Secondary as well as Senior Secondary. Any further suggestions for improving the Manuals are always welcome. Vineet Joshi CHAIRMANThe Board has strengthened the School Based Assessment and Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation in 2009-2010. As part of Comprehensive assessment of co-scholastic aspects, the grades obtained in Health and Physical Education will be reflected in the Report Card as well as Certificate of School Based Assessment. Learners can choose any two activities from the options provided.Advisors: Material Production: Contributors: Cover Page-Courtesy : Joshi (IAS) Cherian Varghese New Delhi.

Frequently Asked Questions Health Manuals address a basic gap in schooling that has crept in over the years. This is largely to do with the aspect of school health which has somehow been relegated to sporadic health check-ups or in some cases a few hours of health instruction in the curriculum. It is imperative that something is done urgently to take up the issue of holistic health in school going children which includes physical, mental, emotional and psychological health. The School Health Policy and the Manual proposes to view health holistically, utilize all the educational opportunities for health promotion including formal and informal approaches in curricular pedagogy. Providing a safe school environment, an activity oriented health education curriculum to prevent health-related risk behavior, ensuring physical fitness activities and sports, providing nutritious snacks in the school canteen, ensuring access to primary health care services and integrated family and community activities and a staff health promotion policy are some of the expectations that a school should fulfill as was advised earlier in a circular issued to all the schools regarding the setting up of Health and Wellness Clubs. There are four Manuals in this package. The first Manual-Volume I is addressed to all stakeholders concerned with school health. A health promoting school strives to provide a healthy environment conducive to students' health, education and school health services along with school/community projects and outreach opportunities for physical education and recreation, social support and mental health promotion. School Health and Wellness Clubs can become the focal point of school health promotion which would encompass the entire school environment and become a school campus activity. A checklist for a Health Promoting School is included so that schools can monitor their own School Health Plan. The responsibilities of the Administrators, Principals, Teachers, Counsellors and Community leaders have also been enlisted. Monitoring, Evaluation and (i)About The Comprehensive School Health ManualsAbout The Comprehensive School Health ManualsSustainability of the Health Plan in each school is extremely essential. Fact Sheets regarding a Health Promoting School, focusing resources on Effective School Health and Improving School Performance through health promotion are other areas of concern. The other three Manuals are activity based manuals for teachers. Vol II is Teachers Activity Manual which consists of activities for Primary Level (Classes I-V), Vol III is Teacher's Manual for Upper Primary Level (Classes VI- VIII) and Vol IV is Teachers' Manual for Secondary and Senior Secondary Level (Classes IX-XII). The activities revolve around six different themes - Knowing your Body, Food and Nutrition, Personal, Environmental Hygiene and Sanitation Physical Fitness, Being Responsible and Safe and Behaviour and Life Skills. The objective of the modules and activities is to focus on the different aspects of growth and appropriate development of the child. will take the child from knowing body parts and their functions to appreciation of the importance of each body part. This will lead to heightened understanding of the need for correct information regarding growing up processes which will help in creating a well informed individual. focus on the effect of the right food and nutrition intake to generate positive energy and thus influence learning capacity. Variation in geographical location alter or modify nutritional intake. Food can effect energy levels, concentration and learning. emphasize on the need to ensure that children follow clean and regular habits regarding bath, bowel movement, sleep, oral hygiene, nails and hair. Once personal hygiene becomes a part of the regular system the child will look forward to having a cleaner environment. Sanitation activities have been added in the Revised Manual. Knowing Your Body Activities Food And Nutrition Activities Personal, Environmental Hygiene and Sanitation Activities (ii)Physical Fitness Activities Being Safe And Responsible Activities Behaviour And Life Skills Section will help children to maintain fitness, strengthen cardiovascular and respiratory system, keep bones and muscles strong, ease depression, manage pain and stress and above all make one feel alive, vibrant and energetic. help learners to understand the consequences of risk taking behavior and create a safe environment for themselves and others. This would lead to a better quality of personal life and would enhance positive behaviour towards self and environment. Security and an environment that is physically and emotionally safe is the need of the hour and equipping a child to handle situations that are age appropriate is the task of the school, family and community. focuses on bringing about an awareness and in-depth understanding of behavioural issues revolving around a child which will certainly influence his or her academic performance and social development. The module is an attempt to forge clarity for the teachers to facilitate the child's learning progress. The objective of the activities is to highlight self management and infuse skills within the child which will help him or her emerge as an individual who will be well equipped to handle related issues. The Manuals are holistic in their approach since they deal with not only physical health but also mental, social, emotional and spiritual well being. Their uniqueness lies in their participative and interactive approach. The activities mentioned can be easily incorporated in the classroom transaction, keeping in mind that hands on learning is internalized faster than conventional learning. It is also recommended that teachers may modify or customize the activities according to their social, cultural and demographic needs. The CBSE had also undertaken a Global School Health Survey across different types of schools in various parts of the country. This was to collect data on health behaviours and protective factors that affect the immediate (iii)and long term health status of young children. The results from the survey will help in policy formulation at the local and national level. The activities for teachers in each Section are suggestive and it is earnestly hoped that they will be implemented in the spirit of each section through curriculum plus intervention strategies within the school. The activities are learner centred and will help learners to empower themselves to acquire knowledge for themselves in a classroom or out of the class setting. The Board has strengthened the School Based Assessment and Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation in 2009-2010. As part of Comprehensive assessment of co-scholastic aspects, the grades obtained in Health and Physical Education will be reflected in the Report Card as well as Certificate of School Based Assessment. Learners can choose any two activities from the options provided. These include Sports/Indigenous Sports, NCC/NSS, Scouting and Guiding, Swimming, Gymnastics, Yoga, First Aid, Gardening / Shramdaan. Teacher may record observations about the student's participation over a period of time either in Anecdotal Records or a Portfolio. All students must take up at least two activities to ensure maximum health benefit in terms of physical fitness. The future of young India is being shaped in the schools and it is imperative that all of us take a proactive role in ensuring that healthy and balanced young minds leave school and forge ahead confidently. We wish teachers will find the Manuals useful and enrich them further with their wisdom and experience. It is an investment that each teacher, principal and parent must make to generate and augment creative and protective capacity of young people in school. This will go a long way in creating a sustainable, social, healthy and peaceful society. Dr. SADHANA PARASHAR HEAD (INNOVATION & RESEARCH) (iv)Activity : Awareness Kit BACKGROUND : METHODOLOGY: l l l l OBSERV ATION:Awareness \"You're doing a good job in drawing that hut!\" \"Your teeth are sparkling!\" \"What a nice smile you have!\" \"You were very graceful in aerobics that day!\" \"You are a very fast runner . Keep working on your strengths and weaknesses too!\" \"I appreciate your 100% attendanceis the first step to realization. Knowledge of one's body parts helps in understanding the various changes taking place and those that have already taken place in the child's body so far. The identification of parts and their function helps a child to convey properly if he is facing any discomfort or is unwell physically . The teacher starts the class with positive and specific reinforcement statements like: The teacher puts up a chart on the board showing parts of the body. Talking about functions of every body part the teacher asks the students to list down what according to them is the probable function of each body part. Important points of discussion can be put up on the board. The questions can be graded i.e from simple to complex depending upon the class and age appropriateness. Students will be able to write down most of the functions of body parts themselves. Teacher can give inputs wherever necessary . 3CONCEPT : OBJECTIVE : MATERIALS REQUIRED: MODE : TIME REQUIRED :To know the functions of various parts of one's body. To help in identifying the various parts of the body and to know their functions. Two chart papers showing parts of the body . Indiv idual 45 minutes1Knowing Your Body CONCLUSION: INFORMAL ASSESSMENT : KEY MESSAGES: SUGGESTED ACTIVITIES: Every part of the body has a specific role to perform. A healthy body doesn't feel fatigued or tired easily . (i)In the human body, one fine day the liver decides to go on a holiday . A lot of problems start arising and the other organs decide to write a letter to the \"Brain\" citing their problems and the crisis which arose after the absence of the liver. Draft a letter to the brain (in not more than 60 words) on behalf of the organs of the body citing why liver should be immediately called back from the holiday .[Students can be asked to write similar thematic paragraphs in situations like what if the heart goes on strike OR What if the stomach decides to go to his parent's house OR What will happen if ears will stop listening to sounds. ] (ii)Do you watch Television? If so identify positive advertisements or images that project the importance of body parts. (i) Self analysis (ii) Self regulation (iii) Knowledge of one's body parts (iv) Awareness of \"feeling good and looking good\" (i) Invite friends over and encourage them to wear whatever makes them feel good-sweat suits, flip flops, pyjamas\u2014and serve delicious food or snacks without any guilt. Urge everyone to come prepared to talk about their feelings and experiences. (ii) Try a new physical activity just for fun. Stop weighing yourself, and change your goal from weight loss to improving your health. (iii) Conduct a \"Love Your Self Campaign\" in the school. (iv) Write a poem on \"My Eyes\" (v) Empty outline method:- The teacher can give a short paragraph involving the various parts of the body using incomplete sentences. The child will be required to complete them. (vi) Select rhymes, poems or stories that talk the about relevance of body parts. Knowing Your Body 4 Activity : Small Wonders BACKGROUND : Finer parts of our body are equally essential for the proper functioning of our body. The nostrils and their mucous lining, eye lids/lashes, fingers, ear muscles, tongue, teeth ,lips etc. play a vital role in conduction systems of our body efficiently . There are certain other parts called as \"vestigial organs,\" which are present in our body but they don't contribute much to the functioning of the body. Examples of vestigial organs are villi, outer ear lobe muscle, eyebrows, hair and nails. Divide the class into groups comprising two students each. Each group will be given the task of finding details regarding a particular \"fine body part\". For e.g. one group works on fingers, the second works on nails, the third works on hair, fourth works on eyelids and eyebrows, fifth works on tongue etc. Allotment of the \"parts \" should be done in such a way that it covers all the major systems of the human body. The students should be given at least two days time to find out relevant information about the body part. Every group will do presentations in the class. While one group is doing the presentation, the other students will be noting down the key areas (the function/presence/mode of action etc.) of the presentation in their science copy. The teacher sums up the exercise by elaborating the importance of the \"small wonders \" on the blackboard. Children already have some prior knowledge about the different parts of the body. They will be interested to know the science behind every organ/body part irrespective of how small it is.METHODOLOGY: OBSERV ATION: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 5Knowing Your Body CONCEPT : OBJECTIVE : MATERIALS REQUIRED: MODE : TIME REQUIRED :Knowledge of various parts of the body, even the minutest one will lead to self-knowledge in child and respect for those parts To make oneself aware of the need to take care of the minutest part of the body Copy, Pencil, Crayons or Colours, Chart P aper Group 30 minutes 6CONCLUSION: INFORMAL ASSESSMENT : Our body is a combination of different systems which work collaboratively in terms of functional aspects of its processes both at cellular as well as sub-cellular level. Divide the students into groups of four(QAXP-Q for question, A for answer , X for expand and P for paraphrase) and conduct a quiz.e.g first group asks a question: What is the role of our nostrils in respiration? The second group provides answer to the question. The third group explains the role of nostrils in detail while the fourth group summarizes the answer . Every group gets a chance to switch roles i.e if once a group asks a question, the next time they answer the question asked by the second group, the third time a question is asked by a group they expand the answer given by another group, and in the fourth time they get a chance to paraphrase the answer . Highlight the need to be healthy rather than slim. In this context highlight the role of muscle building with respect to age, sex and geographical locations. KEY MESSAGE: SUGGESTED ACTIVITIES:(i)Importance of exercise (ii)Self-monitoring (ii)Team work. Ask questions (i)What is \" appendicitis \"? What are \" villi\" and why are they called \" vestigial organs \"? (ii)Conduct simple exercises for increasing the flexibility of fingers. (iii) Play a game. Let children look into the eyes of their neighbouring student and watch who blinks the eyelids first. This exercise will not only help in improving the concentration levels of a child but will also be a good exercise for the eyes.[Overstraining of eyes should be avoided. This exercise should never be done if one is suffering from any minor/major eye infection] (iv) Write an autobiography of an ape.[P oints to be included:] -relationship with man -development of body parts -social interactions -beauty both inner and outer -development of the brain -thinking skills (v)Put on good rhythmic music and let children understand that every part of their body is involved in the exercise. Knowing Your Body Activity : Having Fun ! BACKGROUND : METHODOLOGY:The need and necessity of each part of the body helps to maintain the general appearance and up-keep of the body.

Children will develop motor skills which will help them to actively participate in class activity . At the conclusion of this lesson the students will be able to identify the anatomy of the hand including the fingerprints. They will also know the importance of the hand and its many uses for different activities.OBSERV ATION: CONCLUSION: KEY MESSAGES: SUGGESTED ACTIVITIES:1.Importance of body parts should be acknowledged and every body part should be given equal importance. 2.There are children who are differently abled. 1.Other body parts like nose, eyes, ear , legs and feet may also be considered to illustrate the importance of body parts. 2.Let the children try out activities with body parts other than the ones they use. 3.A game of Simon says can be played where in teacher says, Simon says, raise your hands so the students raise their hands. - She can continue Simon says eyes see and students can touch their eyes. - For every sensory organ she can call out phrases. Activity : My Personal diet ! BACKGROUND : l l l l METHODOLOGY:Learn the four basic food groups: milk products: milk, cheese, yogurt and ice cream meat/eggs: red meat, poultry , fish and eggs grains: bread, cereals, rice, pasta and so forth \u00b7 fruits/vegetables: may be consumed as solids or juices. One should know what to eat before exercise. Eating meat does not improve athletic performance. The best food items to be consumed before prolonged exercise are complex carbohydrates. These include bread, pasta (no odles), potatoes and rice. These should be consumed 3 to 4 hours before the athletic event so that they have passed out of the stomach. Water consumption continues to be important upto the time of participation and every 20 to 30 minutes during the activity . 1.Let the children bring pictures related to the above four basic food groups. 2.Working in groups, let the groups make a collage based on the components of a nutritive diet. CONCEPT : OBJECTIVE : MATERIALS REQUIRED: MODE : TIME REQUIRED :A proper diet helps a person to be healthy . To make oneself aware of the nutritive value of food items. Chart papers for the groups, pictures related to the four basic food groups.

Your friend should develop a positive attitude of self-consciousness. It may be an attitude problem or a medical problem. He should talk to a good counsellor so that he can be helped for the development of confidence and take a diet which is rich in calcium.

So \"dieting\" is the solution where they eat less and work more on exercises to remain thin. How healthy is it?l l l l 56This is a classic myth. One needs to have proper dietary habits to remain fit. Fitness has nothing to do with slimness. To be fit one should be healthy which can happen only when one eats well in the required amounts. On the contrary , eating less and doing more workouts may lead to cardiovascular problems, poor strength of muscles, malnutrition arracmia like anemia and weakness. The above mentioned arts help in promoting greater aerobic capacity , balance, flexibility , muscle endurance and strength. They can be considered as an excellent form of exercise for the promotion of fitness in adolescents and an alternative method to the traditional exercise. No, this is not true. Balanced diet is a diet which contains all the components of food in proper amounts. So it can be achieved from vegetarian as well as non-vegetarian sources. Yes. It contains a huge amount of fat that takes a long time or extensive workout to digest. So, once a week is fine but definitely not on daily basis.

If you eat one chocolate daily it may harm your oral health. Research shows that missing meals can actually lead to an over-compensation and increased food consumption at the next meal. The result can be a gain, not loss in weight. Not only that, when a meal is missed, the body makes up for lost energy by conserving what you have already eaten and thus slows up your metabolism. Vegetarian diets vary greatly and can range from avoiding meat to a strict vegetarian diet, where all foods of animal origin are excluded. Some studies show that vegetarians suffer less from heart disease, some cancers, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes, and that they live longer than meat-eaters. However , any beneficial effect is also likely to be due, in part, to a generally healthier lifestyle adopted by vegetarians including not smoking and taking more exercises. It is not simply a case of omitting meat from the diet. Thus, a vegetarian diet is not automatically healthier than an omnivorous diet and non-vegetarians who are health conscious can live just as long as vegetarians. Vegetarian diets can even be unhealthy if meat and animal products, rich in essential vitamins (e.g. vitamin B12) and minerals (e.g. iron, zinc), are not substituted by nutritionally appropriate foods or compensated by adequate food supplements.Q18 Will martial arts ,aerobics ,dance classes ,kung fu etc. help me to stay fit?

Q30 In case of a fire at home/school what should I do? Q31 Why is it important to have the phone numbers of all family members? Q32 What do I do incase of a road accident?When sugar is consumed, the hormone insulin is required to bring blood sugar levels back down to normal. Diabetes is caused due to a lack of sugar in the diet and not excess. Once someone has diabetes it is important to manage the frequency and amount of eating and the types of carbohydrate, (including sugar) consumed to allow the body to maintain good blood sugar control. You do not inherit fat, but you have a tendency to become fat. The women in your family may tend to store excess weight around their thighs while the men expand around their bellies. But whether you accumulate this fat or not depends on the way you lead your life. If the number of calories you eat each day match those which you burn then you will not gain weight anywhere on your body, regardless of your parents' shape. What tends to happen, however , is that we inherit eating and lifestyle habits from those we grow up with. Kick those habits, eat well, get active. You will look and feel better . As such there is no set rule for drinking water . It is said that water should be taken only after meals are complete. This is just a myth. Fire and burns, motor vehicle safety , choking, suffocation, poisoning, falls, water drowning, risk of any adventure for which one is unprepared for etc. Newspapers carry large coverage on road safety . The Internet has it in plenty . Moreover , police stations, traffic departments and other government departments related to transport have information about it. At home such matters should be immediately informed to parents/elders present at that time in the home and if in school the matter should be reported to any teacher /principal. However a knowledge of use of fire extinguisher and water , switching off the main electricity connection can come in handy . It is important to have the phone numbers of all family members so that people surrounding you can contact your near and dear ones in case of any emergency . An Identity Card is always helpful when one is out of the house for any reason. The nearest police station is to be intimated immediately or the person be rushed to a nearby hospital if he requires any medical help. 58Q33. When do we get an electric shock? Q34. How does one act responsibly when parents are out or when one is all alone at home? Q35. Why do we have mock drills in our school? Q36 I know my father hates me. He finds ways to beat me. What should I do? Q37 I do not have a thumb. I feel ashamed and try to remain indoors. Q38 How can I know that my friends like me truly? Q39 Is my IQ level appropriate according to my age?Electricity is always trying to get to the ground. It takes shortcuts whenever it can. If something that conducts electricity gives electricity an easy path to the ground, electricity will take it. You can never tell when contact with electricity will be fatal, but you can be sure that it will always hurt. Electric shock can cause muscle spasms, weakness, shallow breathing, rapid pulse, severe burns, unconsciousness, or death. Appliances have protective insulated cords and coverings to keep you from contacting the electricity inside. It's important to use appliances and cords the way they were designed to be used so you don't damage the insulation or contact live electrical parts. If a live wire inside an appliance, toy, or power tool touches the inside of the device and you touch the device, it would be like touching a bare live wire. In a shock incident, the path that electric current takes through the body gets very hot. Burns occur all along that path, including the places on the skin where the current enters and leaves the body. The house should be locked from inside. Care should be taken of the younger siblings. Any emergency should be reported to the neighbours first and then to the parents too. The telephone numbers of the neighbours is a must. One needs to apply one's presence of mind in problematic situations when parents have gone very far off. Help of neighbours should be taken judiciously . One of the key objectives of these safety programmes is to create awareness about issues related to Road Safety amongst students and general masses. The students are told about safety rules and regulations through the use of audio-visual aids, interaction through quizzes and live demonstrations wherever undertaken. Other events such as skits on road safety and traffic drills are also organised to educate children on road safety . Mock drills expose a person to situations, which he/she has never encountered before. So the information helps in tackling them. Mock drills are also a part of evacuation drills in case of disasters. Parents just don't beat up their children because they want it that way. There might definitely be some ways by which you may talk to your parents and find a good communication channel with your parents. Not having a thumb is a body deformity but it definitely is not a disability . Even Eklavya did not have a thumb. But he became a legend and was a master archer . So respect yourself for what you are and get ahead in life. It is not a measurable quantity to be known. But if you get along well with your friends and you are able to keep up a good communication with your friends you have already won the hearts of all. IQ of every person depends on the logical approach that an individual has developed as he grows 59up. So IQ's may vary in the same age group. You are tall because your genes carry dominant height genes. Your parents might also be tall. So you do not have to worry . Feel privileged, carry yourself well and enjoy being tall. Your immune system might be not as strong as it should be for your age. Consult a good physician who will advise you on proper eating habits which will help you to develop a strong immune system. Your white spots may be due to deficiency of some minerals and vitamins that may be required by your system. Do not get obsessed by the fact. Instead, consult a good physician and a good dermatologist. You are short in height and may have small stature because of your genes. Your parents might be short. So you do not have to worry . Sixth sense is your inner consciousness that helps you to guide yourself in adversities. As you grow up you may feel guided by this sense. Yes, this is very important as this helps you in case of any emergency . Who decides what is good or bad? If you are able to analyze yourself and make a positive effort to come out of the so-called bad habits you have done a great job! Writing a daily diary may also help you in your self-introspection.

(ii)Recapitulate all that you have listened to as early as possible. (iii) Try to jot down important points. (iv)Avoid any kind of distraction when involved in serious work.Q40 Why am I so tall compared to others in my class? Everybody says I am a Giraffe!!

Children lead happier lives as a result of being actively involved in sporting activities and it has long been established that fitness and improved academics performance go hand in hand. Physical Education and Sports activities during the school hours reduce boredom and help keep students attentive in the classrooms. The Board is of the firm opinion that the Physical Education & Sports programs teach important conflict resolution skills including team work, fair play and communication leading to reduced violent behaviour among children. Further , children who participate in Physical Education & Sports develop a positive attitude towards their every day life activities. In the above background, it is advised that the following in respect of the Physical Education & Sports may be strictly adhered to : a) There should be at least 40-45 minutes of Physical Activities or Games period for Classes I-X everyday . b) For Classes XI-XII it should be ensured that all the students participate in Physical Activity/Games/Mass P.T./Yoga with maximum health benefits for at least two periods per week (90-120 min/week). c) In case the school has constraints of space, climate conditions, presence of enough PE Teachers, or coaches it may consider indoor activities which would provide maximum health benefits (Aerobics/Meditation/Y oga & Asanas). d) Mass P.T. in the morning keeping in view the climate conditions is another alternative the school can have.

ACAD/EO/2006 Dated : 31.5.2006 Circular No. 09 All the Heads of the institutions affiliated to CBSE. Subject: Comprehensive School Health Programme and Creating Health Club in the school. Dear Principal,Childhood and adolescence form the most joyful period of an individual's life. They are times of immense creative energy, self-discovery and exploration of the world. They can also be fraught withfeelings of isolation, loneliness and confusion. They can be due to various factors relating to thephysical, social, emotional, mental and spiritual well being of the younger generation. Schools, families and communities need to play a positive and responsible role in bringing up young children in a healthy environment which would enable each one to maximize their potential. Schools can provide dynamic settings for promoting health, for enabling children to grow and mature into healthy adults. Yet the potential of the school to enhance health is often underutilized. 'SchoolHealth' has largely remained confined to medical check-ups of children or some hours of healthinstruction in the curriculum. There is a growing recognition that the health and psycho-social well-being of children and youth is of fundamental value and the schools can provide a strategic means ofimproving children's health, self-esteem, life skills and behaviour. Although schools have undertakenmany initiatives in promoting school health, the comprehensiveness and sustainability in these initia-tives is not clearly laid out. The need of the hour is a comprehensive school health policy integratedwithin the school system. The Central Board of Secondary Education suggests that schools plan out a Comprehensive School Health Programme which could be initiated through HEAL TH CLUB in each school to begin with. Need For Creating Health Clubs in SchoolsHealthy living incase of school children is the prime concern of all stakeholders including principals, parents, teachers and the community. To achieve this objective collective responsibility needs to beassumed. An important dimension is that of experience and development of health skills and phy-sique through practical engagements with play, exercises, sports and practices of personal and com-munity hygiene. Health and Wellness Clubs in Schools would focus on the overall well being comprising emotional, social and mental health of the child. It would act as the enabling and organizational point for conducting activities related to various dimensions of health and wellness. A Health Card needs to be created for students which would form a continuous part of their growth and development. This could form aneffective monitoring and feedback system for the overall health of a child during his schooling. ...................../- - 2 -Appendix-IV65Constitution of a Health Club Principal as Convener Counselor / Psychologist / P . T Teacher / Nodal Teacher as Secretary Student representative (one boy and one girl from each level) Identified teachers from each level Parent for each level (preferably a doctor) Responsibilities of the Health Club As an organizer of all health relevant activities (at least 8-10 activities in the year at each level). As a Resource Centre for the overall well being of students Objectives of the Health Club To create Health Cards for each student To create a health newspaper at least twice a year/poster competition related to health issues To conduct surveys on health related concerns To organize 'health walks' as part of social campaigns To organize health fairs and immunization projects To tap the local resources in the community to arrange health talks To render service in any area affected by a disaster or a calamity To create health help line within the school to distress, cope with emotional and social behaviour and to clarify misconceptions regarding sexual and reproductive health To teach the students techniques of yoga and meditation from an early age To inculcate in the students healthy and positive ways of living To teach health songs on various health topics Celebration of important days (World Health Day - April 7) Creating awareness regarding 'World No Tobacco Day' (May 31), 'World AIDS Day' (December 1) etc. The Board is suggesting a plethora of activities in Annexure A for various levels which can be conducted as part of co-curricular inputs during the calendar year.

Subject : Importance of Nutrition for Bone Health. Dear Principal,Bone Health is a neglected area and has resulted in various problems both for adults and young children. The major causes for the poor bone health in India are genetic predisposition, lower bone mineral density due to deficiency of calcium and vitamin D, inadequate exposure of body surface area todirect sunshine even though the country has plenty of sunshine throughout the year, clothing pattern,relatively pigmented skin, poor diet, lack of availability of foods fortified with essential vitamins andminerals and lack of physical activity. Childhood and adolescence is the time when bones are beginning to be modeled until around the age of 30 when peak bone mass is achieved. Diet in the modeling phase is extremely important. Acritical element that helps absorb deposition of dietary calcium into bone mass is vitamin D. Defi-ciency of vitamin D is one of major contributory factor responsible for lower bone mineral density(BMD). A related bone problem is flurosis. It is prevalent in 17 States and has affected 66 million people including about 6 million children below the age of 14. It results from consuming ground water withexcessive fluoride leading to bone disorders. Inadequate exposure of body surface area to directsunshine, clothing pattern, relatively pigmented skin, environmental pollution, faulty housing archi-tecture which does not allow enough sunshine, poor diet and lack of required food fortification, areamong the major factors responsible for compromised bone health. It is important to pay attention to bone health right for childhood. It is in this regard, schools may be advised to take steps regarding the following aspects : 1. Schools should promote outdoor physical activity after 9.00 a.m. and before 4.00 p.m. for adequate exposure to sunshine. Sunshine is the most important source of vitamin D. NVitamin. D helps absorption of calcium. The main source of vitamin D is the exposure tosunlight. Exposure of legs and arms to sunlight for about 25 minutes between 9 AM and 4PM is adequate. NPhysical activity at all ages, particularly weight bearing activity, is important for bonehealth. It also reduces the risk of falling by strengthening muscles and maintaining bal-ance. NCalcium is critical for sound bone health. Foods containing calcium like milk, leafy greenvegetables, etc. should be a part of the normal daily diet.703. During the educational programs, schools should emphasis the importance of calcium and vita- min D and thus the schools play a crucial role in creating awareness on such vital issues bysharing this message with the entire student community as well as the parents.

CBSE/ACAD/HELATH/2007 20th June,2007 Circular No. 29 All the Heads of the institutionsaffiliated to CBSE Subject : Comprehensive School Health Programme : Dear Principals,The Central Board of Scondary Education in continuation of its Circular No. 09 dated 31.5.2006 regarding Comprehensive School Health Programme and creating Health Club in school would like toreiterate and create awareness about the following issues : 1. School must have by now intiated the creation the creation of Health Clubs to implement the Comprehensive School Health Programme. i) Health and Wellnesss Clubs in schools need to focus on over all well being comprising mental and social health of the child. These would act as nodal centres for creating an enabling environment in the school to ensure an ambience of wellness and fosteringreventive health care. ii) The Constitution, responsibilities and objectives of a Health Club have already been stated in the previous circular. iii) Activities for promoting health and wellness in schools have also been stated in the circular. 2. Comprehensive School Health Manual The Comprehensive School Health Manual addressed a basic gap in schooling that has crept in over the years. The is largely to do with the aspect of school health which has somehow been relegated tosporadic health check ups or in some cases a few hours of health instruction in the curriculum. It isimperative that something is done urgently to take up the issue of holistic health. The School HealthPolicy and now the Manual proposes to view health holistically, utilize all educational opportunities forhealth promotion including formal and informal aproaches in curriculum and pedagogy. Providing a safe school environment, an activity oriented health education curriculum to avoid health-related risk behaviour, ensuring physical fitness activities and sports, providing nutritous snacks in the schoolcanteen, ensuring access to primary health care services, providing emergency care for illness orinjury, providing counselling services and integrated family and community activities and staff healthpromotion policy are some of the expectations that a school should fulfill as was advised earlier in thecircular issued to all schools regarding setting up of Health Clubs. Comprehensive School Health Manual will be available to all schools by August 2007.3. Health Websites :The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), Government of India has commissioned a website on Health Living ( www.healthy-india.org) to address the concerns in India on the lifestyle preventable diseases.72The objectives of the website are : a) to harmonize the burden of preventable chronic diseases in the country by creating awarenessb) to bring in the need for a healthy lifestylec) to create Agents of Change among school children with regard to health issuesd) to encourage the setting up of a health fostering schoole) to create awareness regarding canteens as social responsible outlets which inculate healthy eating behaviours f) to ensure that there is enough emphasis on physical activity in schools and on enjoyment of this physical activity. The website has been so designed that it is user - friendly and containg a number of dynamic sections for interative sessions. As India advances economically and gains greater control over traditional health threats, diseases related to distorted lifestyles and unhealthy living habits are rapidly growing as major public healthproblems. Imbalanced diet, physical inactivity, tobacco consumption and alcohol abuse are leading tomany Indians suffering from diabetes, heart disease, cancer and lung disease. Many of these diseasesare preventable. Such preventive efforts are best started in childhood and in schooling years. Armed with appropriate health information people can protect and promote their personal health and families can create healthy living conditions for individuals of all ages. Schools and colleges areimportant stakeholders in disseminating healthy lifestyle information to children and youth. Healthy India endeavours to advance consciousness of disease prevention opprtunities, encourage earlier detection and treatment of chronic diseases and foster healthy living through information andresources on healthy lifestyle viz. Healthy Diet; Physical Activity; Dealing problems; Yoga Stress Management; Diabetes; Cancers; Heart Attacks and Strokes.

Subject : Comprehensive School Health Programme and Release of School Health Manuals in four Volumes. Dear Principal,Children are the greatest asset of a country and those in school have a right to a happy and healthy life within the school environment as well as at home. Investment in the health of children is an investment in the future of the nation. It is essential to build on the components of knowledgerelating to health and nutrition, develop healthy attitudes and enhance Life Skills to overcome themultiple health concerns affecting school going children both in the urban and remote areas of thecountry. This is further to our circulars (No. 09 dated 31.5.2006 and No. 29 dated 20.6.2007) on Comprehensive School Health Programme in which the Board has requested schools to set up `Health Clubs' in order toimplement the Comprehensive School Health Programme. It is heartening to note that some of theschools affiliated with the board have responded positively in this regard. Comprehensive School Health Programme and Health Manuals : The objectives of the School Health Club as mentioned in the earlier circular are also being reiterated: To create Health Cards for each student To create a health newspaper at least twice a year / poster competition related to health issues To conduct surveys on health related concerns To organize ` health walks' as part of social campaigns To organize health fairs and immunization projects To tap the local resources in the community to arrange health talks To render service in any area affected by a disaster or a calamity To create health help line within the school to distress, cope with emotional and social behaviour and to clarify misconceptions regarding adolescent health To teach the students techniques of yoga and meditation from an early age To inculcate in the students healthy and positive ways of living To teach health songs on various health topics ................./- Celebration of important days (World Health Day - April 7) Creating awareness regarding `World No Tobacco Day' (May 31), `World AIDS Day (December 1) etc.75Health Manuals : The Comprehensive School Health Manuals address a basic gap in schooling that has crept in over the years. School Health has somehow been relegated to sporadic health check-ups or in some cases afew hours of health instruction in the curriculum. It was imperative that something is done urgentlyto take up the issue of holistic health in school going children which includes physical, mental,emotional and psychological health. The School Health Policy and now the Manuals propose to viewhealth holistically, utilize all educational opportunities for health promotion including formal andinformal approaches in curriculum pedagogy. Providing a safe school environment, an activity orientedhealth education curriculum to avoid health-related risk behavior, ensuring physical fitness activitiesand sports, providing nutrituous snacks in the school canteen, ensuring access to primary health careservices and integrated family and community activities and a staff health promotion policy are someof the expectations that a school should fulfill. There are four Manuals in this package. The first Manual-Vol I is addressed to all stakeholders concerned with school health. The other three Manuals are activity based manuals for teachers. VolII is Teachers Activity Manual which consist of activities for Primary Level (Classes I-V), Vol III isTeacher's Manual for Upper Primary Level (Classes VI-VIII) and Vol IV is Teachers' Manual for Secondaryand Senior Secondary Level (Classes IX-XII). The activities revolve around six different themes -Knowing your Body, Food and Nutrition, Personal and Environmental Hygiene, Physical Fitness, BeingResponsible and Safe and Behaviour and Life Skills. The objectives of the modules and activities is tofocus on the different aspects of growth and age appropriate development of the child. The Manuals are holistic in their approach since they deal with not only physical health but also mental, social, emotional and spiritual well being. Their uniqueness lies in their participative and interactive approach. The activities mentioned can be easily incorporated in the classroom transaction, keeping in mind that hands on learning is internalized faster than conventional learning. It is alsorecommended that teachers may modify or customize the activities according to their social, culturaland demographic needs. The activities for teachers in each Section are suggestive and it is earnestly hoped that they will carry on the spirit of each section through curriculum plus intervention strategies within the school. Theactivities are learner centred and will help to empower them to construct knowledge for themselvesin a classroom or out of the class setting. ................./- The graded activities provided in the manual follow outcome based approach to learning, teaching and assessment. They are positive in attitude and stress on developing health promoting habits from an early age which emphasizes the concept of learning throughout life. For the success of the school health programme it has to be developed and implemented by a strong indigenous group committed teachers under the guidance of the dynamic head of the organization aswell as a committed management. A special feature of this development would be a cooperative,caring and concerned atmosphere which it is hoped will be the key note of the school learningenvironment while implementing the programme. The integration of school and community efforts should be related where the school is regarded as a social unit providing a focal point from which the school may reach out to the family, to the localcommunity and to the community at large as a whole which in turn may support the efforts of theschool.76It is hoped that the Health Manuals will foster the need to provide for a healthy environment for each child studying in a school and in that sense the CBSE Comprehensive School Health Program is dedicatedto all children. The Health Clubs can be used to conduct the activities which are detailed in the School Health Manuals in four Volumes being released to all the schools. One set of the four volumes is being sent to allschools free of cost, however, for additional volumes the school will have to make a request as thesewill be priced documents. These will be available from the Stores, CBSE, 17 Institutional Area, RouseAvenue, New Delhi as well as from the Regional Offices.

CBSE/EO(L)/ACAD/2008 1st Sept.,2008 Circular No. 33/08 All the Heads of the institutionsaffiliated to CBSE. Subject : Creating a Healthy School Environment Dear Principal, One of the lofty aims of education is to shape young individuals into caring, thinking sensitive and value enriched citizens of the country. These are achievable when the schools provide a nurturing environment and create a value based climate within the school. The schools affiliated to CBSE are seen as powerful resources of Human Resource Development. This is possible and can be ensured only if the schools themselves are convinced of the positive benefits of a value enriched environment. The conflicting role models thrown up by the social context as well as the explosion of media often result in giving out ambiguous signals to young minds. It thus becomes even more mandatory that the schools serve as agents of change and transformation by bringing out the best from within eachchild. The inspiration, motivation and upliftment of spirit should go hand in glove with transaction of academic knowledge. The Central Board of Secondary Education has received feedback about certain schools where the school authorities forcibly keep the children back in Classes IX & XI under various pretexts. This has been viewed very seriously. The Board requires all heads of institutions to reflect on the long term objectives of imparting holistic education in schools. It is impossible to create vibrance and a joyfuland friendly learning ambience to ensure there is collaborative synergy between learners, teachers, heads of the institutions, parents and the management of the school. Unless the heads of schools realize their own responsibility towards all these stakeholders there will bea serious backlash from all these quarters. Cases of indiscipline, rowydism, bullying, smoking and other kinds of drug abuse in some institutions have also been reported to which a blind eye is turned by the school authorities. The Adolescence Education Programme and the Life Skills ................/- Programme as well as the Comprehensive School Health Programme advocated by the Board focuses on the growing concerns of adolescence which need to be addressed with an urgency and immediacy and unless stringent action is taken at the right point of time in collaborationwith the parents of the adolescents it may become a matter of serious concern. Life Skills Education is an excellent tool for bringing about positive behavioural changes in individuals. It is essential that all stakeholders involved in imparting value based education within the school environment should come together to find an answer to some of these areas that ultimately concern all of us. This may be brought to the notice of all teachers, students and parents through staff meetings / assembly meetings, circulars and advisory issued and reinforced from time to time.

Dear Principal, The Central Board of Secondary Education has recommended the setting up Health and Wellness Clubs and launched the four manuals in the package of Comprehensive School Health Manuals (vide circular no. 27 dated 24th June, 2008). We hope that you have received the following four volumes of the Comprehensive School Health Manuals : 1. Comprehensive School Health Teachers Activity Manual Volume I 2. Teacher's Manual for Classes I-V3. Teachers' Activity Manual for Classes VI-VIII4. Teachers' Activity Manual for Classes IX - XII In continuation of the above the Board would like to bring to you an advisory on some of the components related to health such as Physical Fitness, Substance Abuse and Emotional Concerns. 1. Physical Fitness : a. There should be at least 30 minutes of Physical Activities or games with maximum health benefits for Classes I-VIII everyday. a. For Classes IX - XII it should be ensured that all the students participate in Physical Activity / Games / Mass P .T / Yoga with maximum health benefits for at least 2 periods per week (90- 120 min / week). b. In case the school has constraints of space, climatic conditions, presence of enough PE Teachers, or coaches it may consider indoor activities which would provide maximum health benefits(Aerobics / Meditation & breathing exercises / Yoga). c. Mass P .T . in the morning keeping in view the climate conditions is another alternative the school can use. d. Too much of time being spent by children at house in watching TV or playing computer games needs to be carefully monitored by the parents. An advisory can be sent by schools to parents and reinforced in the beginning of every term. e. Parental Awareness Programmes regarding Adolescent concerns including the above may be held at regular intervals by the schools.802. Eating Habits and Diet: School canteens should provide healthy snacks which can be monitored by the Health Clubs of the schools. Doctors / Nutritional Experts/ dieticians / Counsellors / Nurses/ Home Science Department may be involved in designing the recipes for the menu (healthy, nutritious, wholesome) and monitoring quality of the food items. Junk / fast food needs to be replaced completely with healthy snacks.Carbonated and aerated beverages may be replaced by juices and diary products (Lassi, Chach, Flavored milk etc.) 3. Substance Abuse : Passive smoking is as harmful as indulging in active tobacco use. Awareness regarding the hazardous effects of passive smoking need to be created among the students and this may also be a part of the Parental Awareness Programmes. Awareness on recent laws enacted on prohibition of Tobacco products in public places needs to be created among students. Heads of Institutes should ensure that noTobacco products should be sold either by minor or by major children in the vicinity of the educational institutes. Regular vigilance against smoking at home and school needs to be emphasized. The matter can be discussed in PTA meetings with parents. Project work on Substance / Tobacco abusemay be assigned to students as part of school assignment across disciplines and `No Tobacco Week' may be celebrated in school. A substance abuse control committee at school level involving PTA member's local leaders and students may also be initiated. Value Education and Value Enhanced Life Skills should form a part of the larger curriculum plus activities in the schools. Schools should also be able to integrate unstructured programmes on Value Education through their Literary Clubs, Health Clubs and Eco Clubs. 4. Emotional Health: There is a need for Value Education aided Conceptual Framework of Life Skills related to values for sensitizing teachers and learners to the Universal Skills such as Thinking Skills (Creative and Critical Thinking, Self Awareness, Problem Solving, Decision Making), Social Skills (Interpersonal Relationships, Effective Communication, Empathy) and Emotional Skills (Managing feeling / Emotions, Coping withStress).

All students study Science as a compulsory subject upto grade X and a significant percentage of them continue studyingPhysics, Chemistry, Biology, BioTechnology, Home Science etc. at senior secondary level. This requiresconduct of regular practical work and use of variety of equipment, instruments, gadgets, materials, chemicals, glassware etc. It is of utmost importance that in order to ensure safety of students working in Science laboratories, every essential precaution is taken well in advance. It is not uncommon to observe that in many cases, the essential safety measures are either not given much attention or are ignored altogether. Gas fittings in chemistry laboratory often do not fulfil themandatory standards and requirements. Chemical are, in many cases, not stored in safe manner and kept under safe custody. It is also observed that exhaust fans are sometimes not provided in chemistry laboratory. Mandatory items such as laboratory coats, goggles and gloves are not used while doingexperimental work. Electrical fittings are at times done with sub-standard materials and components.Laboratories are not located with easy and open exits. Fire extinguishers are not installed at desiredlocations. First aid facilities are inadequate or missing. Medical facilities are also found wanting on many occasions. All such negligent actions may result in dangerous and unfortunate incidents and need to be attended to urgently. In order to ensure safety of students in Science Laboratories, there is an urgent need to look into its different aspects and make the following provisions: Designing of all science laboratories according to necessary norms and standards. Two wide doors for unobstructed exits from the laboratory. Adequate number of fire extinguishers near science laboratories. Periodical checking of vulnerable points in the laboratories in relation to possibility of any mishappening. Ensuring gas fittings in Chemistry laboratory fulfilling desired norms and standards. Periodical checking of electrical fittings/ insulations for replacement and repairs. Timely and repeated instructions to students for careful handling of chemicals and equipments in the laboratory. Display of do's and dont's in the laboratory at prominent places. Safe and secure storage of all chemicals. Proper labelling and upkeep of chemicals. Proper safety and protection provisions such as fume hood, goggles and gloves while doing practical work. Careful supervision of students while doing practical work. Advance precautionary arrangements to meet any emergency situations. Conduct of any additional experimental work only under supervision and with due advance permission.83 Availability of First Aid and basic medical facilities in the school. Proper location of the laboratories. The tragic fire incident in a school at Kumbakonam in 2004 is still afresh in which nearly 100 children lost their precious lives. The Board had issued a detailed Circular no. 28/2004 dated 26th July, 2004 asking schools to take all safety measures for meeting adverse situations and ensuring safe custodyof children in the school. It is reiterated that all necessary safety measures may be taken and theabove guidelines may be discussed in detail with the teachers as well as students for greater awarenessand sensitization on safety matters. The Board may depute an expert team to visit your school to find out whether all safety provisions in Science laboratories have been made.

Dear Principal, Schools are dynamic settings for promoting health and wellness through various correlated areas such as Physical Education and Sports as well as through Health and Wellness Clubs. There is a growingawareness that the health and psycho-social well-being of young children is of paramount importance and schools can provide a strategic means of improving children's health, self-esteem, life skills and behaviour. Healthy living incase of school children is the prime concern of all stakeholders including principals, parents, teachers and the community. To achieve this objective collective responsibility needs to be assumed. An important dimension is that of experience and development of health skills and physique through practical engagements with play, exercises, sports and practices of personal and communityhygiene. The CBSE through its various advisories (Circular No. 09 dated 31.5.2006, Circular No. 29 dated 20th June, 2007, Circular No. 27/08 dated 24th June, 2008, Circular No. 49 dated 6th Nov., 2008 and Circular No. 57 dated 20.11.2009) has directed schools to set up Health and Wellness Clubs which can be used to conduct the activities which are detailed in the School Health Manuals in four volumesalready released to all the schools. It is well established that participation in Physical Education & Sports activities is highly beneficial to one's health and it leads to improved performance by students in schools, in addition to helping them in developing many life skills. Children lead happier lives as a result of being actively involved in sporting activities and it has long been established that fitness and improved academics performance go hand in hand. Physical Educationand Sports activities during the school hours reduce boredom and help keep students attentive in the classrooms. Keeping in view the above, the Central Board of Secondary Education has time and again recommended for providing compulsory time schedule for Physical Education & Sports activities for the students ofall classes. The Board is of the firm opinion that the Physical Education & Sports programs teach important conflict resolution skills including team work, fair play and communication leading to reduced violentbehaviour among children. Further, children who participate in Physical Education & Sports develop apositive attitude towards their every day life activities. In the above background, it is advised that the following in respect of the Physical Education & Sports may be strictly adhered to: a. There should be at least 40-45 minutes of Physical Activities or Games period for Classes I-X everyday. b. For Classes XI - XII it should be ensured that all the students participate in Physical Activity / Games / Mass P .T / Yoga with maximum health benefits for at least two periods per week90(90-120 min / week). c. In case the school has constraints of space, climatic conditions, presence of enough PE Teachers, or coaches it may consider indoor activities which would provide maximum health benefits(Aerobics / Meditation / Yoga & Asanas). d. Mass P .T . in the morning keeping in view the climate conditions is another alternative the school can have. As part of Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation the students will be assessed on participation and performance in by choosing any two activities from the 13 activities given for Classes VI-VIII and 08 activities given for Classes IX-X. It is earnestly hoped that all schools will follow these directives to ensure that all students draw maximum health benefit in terms of physical fitness and team building as well as collaborative skills.This may be brought to the notice of all teachers, students and parents.

PRO, CBSE CHAIRMAN91BASIC EMERGENCY CARE Cardiac arrest occurs in 70% of individuals at home and 20% at workspace and only in 10% at hospital. It is therfore important that non-healthcare persons such as schoolchildren, teachers, police anddrivers should learn how to o save life and transport the patient to the nearest health facilit. Cardiopulmonary resucitation (CPR) is a procedure to support and maintain breathing and cirulation for a person who has stopped breathing (respiratory arrest) and/or whose heart has stopped (cardiacarrest.) Basic Emergency Care (BEC) is the emergency care which can be provided by schoolchildren, teachers, police and drivers in the absence of advanced medical care. If one school kid is trained in CPR, he or she can take care of his peers, family members and community at large. Beside CPR and foreign body reomoval, it also includes considerations of patient transport such as the protection of the cervical spine and avoiding additional injuries through splinting andimmobilization. When witnessing sudden collapse in victims of all ages, the rescuer should first telephone the emergency medical services system and then return to continue CPR (phone first) . But for unwitnessed arrest (eg drowning, drug overdose and injured), the rescuer should deliver five cycles of CPR before calling emergency number and then continue CPR (phone fast) . THE CHAIN OF SURVIVALThe highest survival rate from cardiac arrest can be achieved only when the following sequence of events occurs as rapidly as possible : 1. Early recognition of warning signs2. Activation of emergency medical services3. Basic CPR 4. Defibrillation 5. Management of airway and ventilation6. Intravenous administration of medications Figure 1 : The adult chain of survival. The 4 links of actions in the chain are (1) phone (2) CPR, (3) early defibrillation and (4) advanced care Appendix-V92These events have been likened to the links in a chain - The chain of Survival. It was introduced in 1991 as a model of efficiency and synergy in resuscitative efforts. If any link is weak or missing, the chances of survival are lessened. The links in the Adult chain or sruvival are : 1. Early access2. Early CPR3. Early defibrillation4. Early advanced cardiac life support Reference : Basic Emergency Care - by Dr. Sanjeev Boi, Dr. John. Bera, Dr. Chhavi Sawhney, Published by "}
