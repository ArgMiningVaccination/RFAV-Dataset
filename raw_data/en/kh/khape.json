Maybe you're thinking about trying a colon cleanse, also called colonic treatment, hydro colon therapy, colonic irrigation, or colon detox. These types of treatments are often advertised as a proactive approach to good colon health, but are there really medical benefits? \"Colon cleanses do not replace the need for regular screenings with your doctor.\" What is a colon cleanse? Colon cleanses, which date back thousands of years, are usually done by a colonic hygienist. During a colon cleanse, the hygienist inserts a tube into the rectum while you lie on a table. A large amount of water is pushed through the tube to flush the colon. The water is then released through the colon in a way similar to a bowel movement. What are the benefits? Practitioners boast a variety of supposed health benefits, including removing toxins from the body, improving the immune system, helping with weight loss, improving digestion, boosting mood, and even reducing the risk of colon cancer. But is there any truth to these claims? \"The presumed health benefits of these treatments are not proven,\" says [Dr. David Group](https://www.cedars-sinai.org/locations/tower-hematology-oncology-medical-group-167.html). \"There are no established scientific benefits and in fact, there's actually risk when doing these treatments in a non-medical setting.\" \"There are no established scientific benefits and in fact, there's actually risk when doing these treatments in a non-medical setting.\" What are the risks of a colon cleanse?
