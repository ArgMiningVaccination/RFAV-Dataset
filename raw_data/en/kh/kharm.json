PFAS are in non -stick pans, firefighting foams, and many oth er materials, and have leached into the drinking water of millions of Americans. While a patchwork of state regulations has sought to address PFAS contamination, the federal government has been slow to act, despite increasing evidence of PFAS' toxicity. Th e federal government's failure to regulate PFAS is egregious on its own, but it is also a symptom of a larger issue that plagues the chemical regulatory framework: presumptive innocence towards toxic chemicals. This article tells the story of PFAS regulati on in three parts. First, it covers attorney Robert Bilott's early discoveries of PFAS contamination and his pioneering tort claims, followed by the federal government's ability and failure to regulate PFAS under each pertinent federal regulatory scheme. I t concludes with a discussion of compelling alternative regulatory frameworks, all of which embrace a version of the precautionary principle. While there have been many efforts to tell a coherent story about the toxic threat posed by PFAS, most popularly t he 2019 film Dark Waters , this article situates the failure to regulate PFAS within the broader failings of our chemical regulatory system and offers an alternative vision for chemical regulation: one that embraces the precautionary principle and protects human health as the ultimate priority of the federal chemical regulatory scheme.

INTRODUCTION A quick scan of the Environmental Working Group's map1 of sites contaminated by PFAS shows a crowded constellation of data points blanketing every state in the nation. Research shows that PFAS are found in the blood of the general population in every geographic region in the United States.2 News outlets from the New York Times to regional blogs have highlighted the health dangers posed by PFAS, dubbing them the \"forever chemicals.\"3 The Environmental Working Group estimates that up to 110 million Americans are exposed to dangerous levels of PFAS in their dri nking water.4 Millions of Americans are asking: what is the federal government doing to protect us? Very little, unfortunately.

This article seeks to synthesize the vast story of PFAS in the United States and explain how this family of chemicals has evaded strict regulation under various pertinent regulatory schemes. This evasion presents a learning opportun ity for American regulators and legislators, as PFAS demonstrates that American chemical regulation is not the airtight system is purports to be. This article contends that more stringent chemical regulatory frameworks \u2014particularly those offering less defe rence to manufacturers, like the EU's REACH program and California's Green Chemistry program \u2014present compelling alternatives for federal regulation of PFAS. Part I I of this article discusses the story of PFAS in the United States to the present day, illumi nated largely by attorney Robert Bilott in his book, Exposure .5 Part II I explains how PFAS managed to evade federal regulation despite the seemingly expansive American regulatory state. In that Section, this article explores the failure to regulate PFAS u nder the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, its subsidiary, the Emergency Planning and Community Right -to-Know Act, a nd the Clean Water Act. Part IV discusse s alternative regulatory systems that provide templates for more effective and health -protective chem ical regulation. Finally, Part V contains reflections and recommendations for the future of federal chemical regulation. II. THE STORY OF PFAS IN THE UNITED STATES PFAS is a generic term for a family of thousands of synthetic per - and polyfluoroalkyl substances that are used in various consumer products because they are fire resistant and effectively repel oil, grease, and water.6 They are found in firefighting foams, insulation, cleaners, textiles, clothing, and cookware.7 Due to their widespread use in consumer products and persistence in the environment, PFAS have been nicknamed \"forever chemicals\" and are now present in the environment worldwide.8 Domestic ally, the primary sources of PFAS are manufacturing (for products such as nonstick pans) and powerful flame retardant foams used most often in military exercises.9 PFAS have been linked to kidney and testicular cancers, thyroid disease, decreased fertilit y, and decreased response to vaccines.10 5 ROBERT BILOTT , EXPOSURE (2019). 6 Kray & Wightman, supra note 2 , at 36.

Mr. Bilott took Mr. Tennant's case and unraveled a complicated story of environmental malpractice and corporate greed. Despite DuPont's own studies confirming the toxicity of PFOA \u2014the main PFAS in Te flon, which was produced in Parkersburg \u2014the company did not provide regulators with all of the information they had on PFOA's health risks, as they were required to under TSCA.18 3M, another American chemical giant, had stopped manufacturing PFOA because i t determined that PFOA was toxic. Instead of interpreting 3M's move as a warning against manufacturing PFAS, DuPont embraced 3M's absence from the market as an invitation to start manufacturing its own PFAS.19 By failing to report the toxicity data they found, DuPont circumvented the TSCA regulatory process \u2014eventually resulting in a $16.5 million fine \u2014and was erroneously permitted to dispose of PFOA -contaminated sludge in an unlined landfill designated for non -hazardous waste.20 Shortly after DuPont started disposing toxic waste this way, the company learned through its own water sampling that 11 Mr. Bilott 's story is also the subject of a recent film, DARK WATERS (2019). 12 ROBERT BILOTT , EXPOSURE 16 (2019). 13 Id. at 10, 16. 14 Id. at 18 -19. 15 Id. at 5. 16 Id. at 19. 17 Id. at 17 -18. 18 Id. at 81 -82.

Although Mr. Tennant's experience presented a particularly egregious example of corporate malfeasance, his consumption of PFAS -contaminated water is far from unique. An August 2016 study found that the drinking water of at least six million people contained PFAS at concentrations exceeding the level deemed healthy by EPA.22 Our knowledge of the toxicity of PFOA comes from an epidemiological study of a class of 69,030 plaintiffs in Parkersburg and the surrounding area that was part of Mr. Bilott's litigation with DuPont.23 Scientists discovered PFOA in the class members' blood at rates five times higher than normal.24 Subsequent studies established links between PFOA and six adverse health outcomes: pregna ncy-induced hypertension and preeclampsia, testicular cancer, kidney cancer, thyroid disease, ulcerative colitis, and high cholesterol.25 These massive epidemiological studies demonstrate the overwhelming effort required to overcome the presumptive innocen ce baked into the federal chemical regulatory system: originally slated to take two years at a cost of $5 million, the 2009 study took seven years and cost $35 million.26 Most people harmed by PFAS simply do not have the time or resources to gather this ty pe of data. In addition to Mr. Bilott's advocacy, PFAS are rapidly entering political conversation because of improved analytical methods for detecting the presence of PFAS and, consequentially, an increase in available data and academic awareness about th eir pervasiveness.27 As a result, PFAS have been exposed to increased media coverage, public concern, and lawsuits.28 However, the federal government still has not comprehensively regulated PFAS under any relevant environmental laws. In response to the inc reased awareness of PFAS contamination, some states have made significant headway in regulating PFAS, primarily those that have high concentrations of PFAS in their soil and water.

Multiple reports from news outlets across the nation are added every day, with titles like \"Should you be concerned about what 's in your drinking water? \" and \"Manmade chemical has contaminated wells, could trickle into communities across Wisconsin. \" 42 University of California, Davis [Vol. 44:1 officials identified 34 PFAS in concentrations as high as 70,000 parts per trillion (\"ppt\") in water within a 65 -mile radius of the Saint -Gobain plastics factory.29 In response, New Hampshire has set a groundwater quality standard of 12 ppt \u2014 approximately 0.0002% of the high concentrations found near M errimack \u2014 meaning that the state believes any more than a few droplets in an Olympic -sized swimming pool would be an unsafe level of contamination.30 In Vermont, liquid with PFOA or PFOS concentrations over 20 ppt is considered hazardous waste and is subjec t to hazardous waste regulation.31 A few states have set enforceable drinking water standards, including Michigan, which recently enacted stringent maximum contaminant levels: 8 ppt for PFOA and 16 ppt for PFOS.32 Before Michigan, New Jersey led the way by setting a 14 ppt maximum contaminant level for PFOA.33 States have started to increase pressure on EPA, as attorneys general from California, New York, Illinois, and Massachusetts have called on EPA to set drinking water standards far below its current no n-enforceable health advisory level of 70 ppt.34 In their public comments under EPA's preliminary determination that a National Primary Drinking Water Regulation (\"NPDWR\") is appropriate for PFOA and PFOS, the attorneys general explained that they did not have the resources to pull off the regulation themselves: \"Without a federal NPDWR and [maximum contaminant level] for PFAS, public water systems in many states will not be required to monitor or address PFAS contamination.\"35 As the state attorneys genera l point out, the federal government has been slow to act. The FDA has banned three PFAS in food packaging,36 but EPA has not utilized its primary regulatory tools to remedy PFAS contamination. In 2016, EPA issued a \"lifetime health advisory\" level for PFOA and PFOS in drinking water of 70 ppt under the Safe Drinking Water Act's (\"SDWA\") authority.37 This advisory level is non -binding, however, and EPA has no authority to enforce that level against contaminators or utilities.38 EPA has not formally committed to 29 Tom Perkins, The 'forever chemicals ' fueling a public health crisis in drinking water , THE GUARDIAN (Feb. 3, 2020, 5:00 AM), https: //www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/03/pfas - chemicals note 2 , at 38.

In the face of governmental failures, the tort s ystem has served as a crucial regulatory backstop for exposing and stopping PFAS contamination. Without the tort system, we would not have the knowledge that we currently do about the harms from PFAS. This data had to be extracted from DuPont in the crucib le of trial, and the PFOA study still provides the most comprehensive information available about any PFAS. And the courtroom battles continue: lawsuits have been brought by people exposed to PFAS, like Earl Tennant, as well as utilities, local governments , and even shareholders facing financial risk.42 In February 2017, DuPont settled 3500 lawsuits in Ohio and West Virginia for an eye -popping $670.7 million.43 Judges in South Carolina and Ohio are handling hundreds of lawsuits consolidated in multidistrict litigation related to firefighting foams, and class actions are pending in Vermont, Michigan, North Carolina, and New York against PFAS manufacturers DuPont, 3M, Saint -Gobain Performance Plastics Corp., and Wolverine World Wide Inc.44 An Ohio firefighter, Kevin Hardwick, assisted by Mr. Bilott, is also attempting to certify a class of plaintiffs exposed to PFAS through firefighting foams and is requesting a nationwide epidemiological 39 U.S. ENV'T PROT.

III. PRESUMPT IVE INNOCENCE, REGULATORY INERTIA, AND THE FAILURE TO FEDERALLY REGULATE PFAS In a House Oversight Committee hearing on PFAS regulation, actor Mark Ruffalo \u2014who plays attorney Robert Bilott in the 2019 film Dark Waters , based on Mr. Bilott's book \u2014summed up the situation powerfully: \"In America, it falls to us, the ordinary people, to prove that these chemicals are toxic before the chemical is regulated by our government. That is simply backwards.\"47 As law professors Steve Gold and Wendy Wagner recently obse rved in Science magazine, \"assessments for PFAS chemicals appear to have been conducted \u2014at best\u2014on an ad hoc basis and primarily through negotiated agreements.\"48 This informational asymmetry is the fundamental barrier to effective, health -protective chemical regulation, along with reticent agencies and onerous statutory obligations on regulatory bodies. The United States purports to have a comprehensive chemical r egulatory system: the Toxic Substances Control Act (\"TSCA\") to regulate chemicals in production and distribution, a variety of workplace safety laws governing the use of chemicals in employment, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and L iability Act (\"CERCLA\") and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\"RCRA\") to regulate disposal of chemicals, the Clean Water Act and SDWA when the chemicals enter our waterways, as well as disclosure requirements like the Toxics Release Inventory. The Ho use Committee on RCRA went so far as to say that RCRA \"eliminates the last remaining loophole in environmental law.\"49 But, as the PFAS saga shows, this is not the case. EPA has made only hesitant steps towards using its authority to address the PFAS probl em. EPA lauds its 2010/2015 PFOA Stewardship Program as one such proactive step taken to address PFOA contamination50 \u2014the PFAS used in 45 Id.

No. 94 -1491, 94th Stewardship Program Fact Sheet ]. 2021] Presumptive Innocence v. the Precautionary Principle 45 Teflon, and the subject of the West Virginia contamination brought to light by Mr. Bilott. The Stewardship Program invit ed eight major PFAS manufacturers51 to commit to a ninety -five percent reduction in PFOA emissions \u2014using a baseline of the year 2000 \u2014and work towards complete elimination by 2015.52 Consistent with the broader self -monitoring theme in chemical regulation, all participating companies self -reported that they had met the PFOA Stewardship Program goals.53 However, EPA confessed that after the conclusion of the Stewardship Program, existing stocks of PFOA could still be used, and some PFOA could still be importe d in products.54 Allowing this type of residual usage is particularly problematic when dealing with a so -called \"forever chemical.\" In addition, PFOA, despite its historical prevalence, is only one of thousands of potentially harmful PFAS present in the en vironment. Given the scale of PFAS contamination, this voluntary PFOA cleanup program was a drop in the bucket. Moreover, it is possible that the PFOA Stewardship program was a band -aid solution that may have slowed EPA's more comprehensive PFAS regulatory efforts at the time. This article explores multiple potential avenues for regulation that have been substantially unused for PFAS thus far, despite some incremental regulatory steps taken under each statute. These include SDWA, TSCA, CERCLA and its subsid iary, EPCRA, as well as the Clean Water Act. Under each statute, this article explores the progress made towards PFAS regulation and the barriers to fully utilizing the statutory authority to address the PFAS problem. Of the laws discussed here, TSCA poten tially provides the most regulatory tools to the federal government, while SDWA addresses the pressing problem of contaminated drinking water, like in Earl Tennant's situation. Regulation under CERCLA would likely be quite effective for remediating PFAS co ntamination, but it would expose polluters to enormous liability, and industry groups have pushed back against CERCLA regulation. The Clean Water Act is a comparatively rare avenue for pollutant regulation, but some legislators are hoping to use it to addr ess the PFAS problem. There is significant overlap among these laws, but no combination has yet been used successfully to comprehensively regulate the PFAS family of chemicals. A. Safe Drinking Water Act SDWA is the primary federal regulatory tool for prot ecting drinking water in America. No PFAS are currently regulated as contaminants under the SDWA, even though EPA is monitoring certain PFAS under SDWA authority.

See text accompanying note 85 , infra . 46 University of California, Davis [Vol. 44:1 years, EPA publishes a list of contaminants that are known or likely to exist in public water systems and may require regulation under the SDWA, known as the \"contaminant candidate list.\"55 PFOA and PFOS \u2014the two most \u2014were included in the 2009 contaminant candidate list56 and remained on the renewed 2016 list, committing E PA to \"further evaluation,\" but EPA has yet to issue any regulations regarding those PFAS.57 Under the SDWA, EPA also has authority to issue non -binding health advisories for contaminants, even if EPA declines to regulate a contaminant.58 These health advi sories provide information on \"health effects, testing methods, and treatment techniques for such unregulated contaminants of concern.\"59 As mentioned previously, EPA has issued a non -binding health advisory level of 70 ppt for PFOA and PFOS in drinking wa ter, separately or combined.60 To generate further data, EPA required roughly 5,000 water systems to monitor for certain PFAS, finding that approximately 5.5 million people were receiving drinking water with PFOA and/or PFOS levels above the EPA health adv isory level of 70 ppt.61 To regulate a contaminant under SDWA, EPA must find that (1) the contaminant may have adverse effect on health of humans, (2) there is a known or substantial likelihood that the contaminant will occur at the frequency or levels of public health concern in public water systems, and (3) regulating the contaminant will provide a meaningful opportunity for reductions of health risks.62 EPA has not officially made these conclusions for any PFAS chemical, which would trigger the regulator y process, despite mounting evidence of the toxicity of PFAS and their prevalence in drinking water. The EPA Administrator signed preliminary determinations to regulate PFOA and PFOS on February 20, 2020;63 however, as of this writing in November 2020, no substantial process had been made to regulate PFOA and PFOS under the SDWA.64 Thus far, SDWA 55 Drinking Water Act , https://www.epa.gov/ccl/contaminant -candidate -list-3-ccl-3#federal -register - notices. 57 Drinking Water Candidate List 4 -Final, 81 Fed.

Some observers have recommended that EPA utilize the Urgent Threat and Emergency Powers provisions of the SDWA to set a nationwide PFAS drinking water stan dard to remedy the pressing problem of PFAS contamination of drinking water.65 The Urgent Threat provision allows EPA to bypass the traditional rulemaking process when a contaminant's presence in drinking water requires immediate attention.66 However, EPA has never used the Urgent Threat provision.67 Moreover, in its 2019 Action Plan, EPA affirmed that it intended to follow the traditional SDWA rulemaking process to regulate PFAS.68 Similarly, EPA has stated that the Emergency Powers provision \u2014which also al lows EPA to sidestep the traditional regulatory process when public health is imminently threatened \u2014cannot be used to set a nationwide drinking water standard.69 EPA has used the Emergency Powers provision to require PFOA/PFOS decontamination of water at f our sites, including three Department of Defense sites,70 but this site -by-site adjudication is not sufficient to address PFAS contamination of drinking water. Thus, despite the potential promise of these provisions, they will not be used by the current EP A to regulate PFAS in drinking water. B. Toxic Substances Control Act TSCA allows the government to regulate chemicals apart from their impact on drinking water. TSCA gives EPA the authority to require reporting, record - keeping, and testing of chemicals, a nd restrict the use of chemical substances.71 Under Section 8 of TSCA, EPA keeps a list of each chemical substance that is used in the United States under TSCA authority, known as the TSCA inventory.72 All substances in the inventory are deemed \"existing\" substances, meaning that new chemical regulat ions generally do not affect use of those substances. However, an inventory listing is not accompanied by any regulatory requirements.73 EPA reports that of over 600 \"existing\" PFAS in the TSCA 65 Hannah Levine, Zombie Chemicals -Learning From Our Past to Prevent Haunting in the Futu re: Why the EPA Should Regulate PFAS Chemical Compounds , 21 VT.

Analyses of TSCA by the National Resea rch Council, Government Accountability Office, EPA, and others have widely concluded that TSCA has failed to meet the intent of Congress in enacting a comprehensive chemical regulatory system.75 Federal regulation under TSCA has required testing of only 200 chemicals and banned or restricted fewer than 10 of those chemicals in the forty years since TSCA was enacted.76 Scholars at U.C. Berkeley's Center for Occupational and Environmental Health observe that TSCA has produced three \"gaps\" in U.S. chemical pol icy: a data gap, because investigation and reporting requirements are insufficient; a safety gap, because the government lacks the tools it needs to mitigate health and environmental risks; and a technology gap, because lax chemical regulation has discoura ged green chemistry research into safer alternatives.77 These data and safety gaps in particular are crucial to understanding how PFAS have gone largely unregulated under TSCA. When TSCA was passed in 1976, it grandfathered in the 62,000 existing chemical substances that were already in commercial circulation \u2014including PFOA and other PFAS \u2014essentially deeming these chemicals innocent until proven guilty.78 That deferential approach extended to new chemicals as well. Under TSCA's original scheme, before EPA c ould require manufacturers to produce hazard and exposure data for the chemicals they produce, EPA had to establish for each individual chemical either (1) that a chemical may present an unreasonable risk to human health or the environment, or (2) that the re is either significant human exposure potential or substantial quantities of a chemical released into the environment.79 Thus, EPA had to meet a significant burden before requiring chemical data under TSCA. This evidentiary burden exacerbates the \"safety gap\" because EPA can only regulate a dangerous chemical if it makes a finding that the benefits outweigh the costs to industry and presents the \"least burdensome\" means of addressing the risk.80 Further, although TSCA requires manufacturers to notify EPA of any new or unpublished chemical hazard information, this creates a perverse incentive for manufactures to avoid 74 U.S. ENV'T PROT.

III.B, recent history indicates that the Act's improvements have not yet been truly effective, and the \"gaps\" in TSCA will persist if the Lautenberg Act's TSCA amendments are not properly implemented. Instead of regulating the use of exis ting PFAS like PFOA under TSCA authority, EPA has relied on more permissive Significant New Use Rules (\"SNURs\").82 Under Section 5(a) of the Toxic Substances Control Act, EPA can use a SNUR to require manufacturers to notify EPA before using chemicals in ways that may create concerns.83 In 2015, EPA announced a SNUR for PFOA, requiring manufacturers and importers of PFOA and some PFOA -related chemicals to notify EPA at least 90 days before using these chemicals.84 In February 2020, EPA issued a supplemental proposal that would require it to review new uses of imported products containing certain PFAS as a surface coating.85 EPA posits that this rule closes \"an important loophole that currently allows products containing certain PFAS chemicals that have been phased out in the United States to still be imported\" \u2014the PFOA loophole left open after the PFOA Stewardship Program.86 In July 2020, five years after being announced, the SNUR for PFOA was finalized.87 Concerning new PFAS, according to its February 2020 program update, EPA has reviewed around 300 new PFAS chemical notices and regulated approximately 200 of them with conse nt orders and/or SNURs under TSCA authority.88 (Note that this is separate from EPA's review of existing PFAS in the TSCA inventory, discussed earlier in this section.) However, these case -by-case adjudications for new and existing PFAS do not marshal all of EPA's TSCA authority to provide the protections the public needs against PFAS. New variations of PFAS continue to be introduced into the environment and persist indefinitely.89 The burden TSCA places on EPA before it can regulate a substance, combined w ith an industry -friendly EPA, present significant obstacles to comprehensive PFAS regulation under TSCA. EPA should require toxicity data from PFAS manufacturers and use that information to implement rules under 81 Id. at 1205 (restating requirements under TSCA section 8(e)). 82 EPA PFAS Program Update , supra 74 , at 10. 83 U.S. ENV'T , supra note 74 , at 10. 85 Id. 86 Id. 87 Long -Chain Perfluoroalkyl Carboxylate and Perfluoroalkyl Sulfonate 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 721 (2020). 88 See EPA PFAS Program Update , supra note 74 at 10. 89 See, e.g. , John W.

Once PFAS are introduced int o the environment, however, other laws provide opportunities for regulation. C. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act CERCLA \u2014also known as the Superfund law \u2014allows EPA to hold emitters of hazardous substances strictly liable for their past emissions.90 It is the bedrock law for environmental liability, requiring reporting of emissions as well as environmental remediation and cleanup.91 However, reporting and remediation can only be required under CERCLA if a chemical is desig nated as a \"hazardous substance.\"92 For hazardous waste currently being emitted, RCRA applies, and designation as a RCRA hazardous substance would trigger liability under CERCLA as well.93 Groups such as Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility an d the UC Berkeley Environmental Law Clinic have initiated parallel efforts to use RCRA to designate certain PFAS as hazardous substances.94 However, CERCLA designation is the focus of this section because CERCLA has a broader scope than Subtitle C of RCRA, and the most harmful PFAS, like PFOA, are largely stored \u2014CERCLA's domain \u2014and not manufactured much anymore, which RCRA would cover. During a speech in September 2019, EPA's General Counsel Matthew Leopold indicated that EPA was actively considering design ating PFOA and PFOS as CERCLA hazardous substances by the end of 2019.95 Doing so would allow EPA to set reportable quantities for PFAS under CERCLA and require parties responsible for contamination to clean up their sites.96 EPA did not accomplish this in 2019, and Congress removed provisions in the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act which would require EPA to designate PFAS as hazardous substances, rendering the liability provisions of CERCLA unusable.97 If PFAS are des ignated as hazardous substances, PFAS polluters would be liable for cleanups and remediation of contaminated sites \u2014a terrifying possibility for large private polluters like DuPont and government actors like the Department of Defense.

PFAS contamination has been confirmed at almost 300 military installations, with many more sites being tested.102 EPA repo rts in its 2020 PFAS Program Update that CERCLA enforcement action has been taken against one PFAS polluter, Wolverine World Wide, in Michigan;103 however, on closer examination, the federal CERCLA action was actually related to other hazardous waste, while the state environmental authorities compelled action on PFAS contamination.104 Rep. Debbie Dingell's PFAS Action Act of 2019, passed by the House in January 2020, would require EPA to designate PFAS as hazardous substances under CERCLA, but the bill is sti ll being considered in the Senate.105 There is little question that if EPA designates PFAS as hazardous substances and requires reportable quantities similar to the health advisory maximum contaminant level, the designation would expose polluters to enormou s liability for cleanup. Thus, while EPA has the potential to require stringent clean -ups of PFAS under CERCLA, significant opposition exists to designating PFAS as CERCLA hazardous substances.106 D. Emergency Planning and Community Right -to-Know Act There has been some minor progress towards gathering toxicity data under the EPCRA.

As Scott Faber, the senior vice president f or governmental affairs for the Environmental Working Group, points out, \"[w]hen your water is polluted with toxic PFAS, it's not much comfort to know who is polluting it.\"112 E. Clean Water Act The Clean Water Act contains a Toxic Pollutants List for subst ances which must be regulated. Section 307 of the Clean Water Act authorizes EPA to designate certain contaminants as toxic pollutants.113 Under Section 307, when a contaminant is listed in the Toxic Pollutant List, EPA is authorized to promulgate Effluent Limitation Guidelines that establish requirements for those pollutants.114 Adding pollutants to the Toxic Pollutant List triggers additional requirements for states, requiring them to adopt standards for pollutants on the list.115 However, since the adoption of the initial list in 1978, the list has not changed substantially.116 Representatives Chris Pappas (NH -01) and Annie Kuster (NH - 02) introduced legislation on July 2, 2019117 that would add certain PFAS to the Clean Water Act's Toxic Pollutants List, but t hese efforts have been unsuccessful 107 U.S. ENV'T PROT.

REGULATORY ALTERNATIVES THAT EMBRACE THE PRECAU TIONARY PRINCIPLE The preceding sections outline how PFAS have slipped through the cracks of federal regulation for decades, despite the complex and seemingly extensive federal chemical regulatory scheme. Due to prohibitive statutory requirements, oppositi on from the powerful chemical lobby, and fear of liability, in recent years an industry -friendly EPA has allowed numerous opportunities for meaningful PFAS regulation to pass by, and many of the substantive provisions of the nation's bedrock environmental laws gather dust while American soil and water are contaminated.118 Ultimately, however it manifests, EPA has used these statutes to embrace or allow forms of \"presumptive innocence\" towards chemical manufacturers, and the American people pay the price. The PFAS saga offers an opportunity to critically examine our chemical regulatory framework and consider compelling alternatives to the system we currently have in place. The most effective of these alternatives \u2014EU's REACH and California's Green Chemistry app roach \u2014embrace the precautionary principle: \"when an activity raises threats of harm to human health or the environment, precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically.\"119 A. A Rec ent Attempt at TSCA Reform In response to TSCA's well -documented failings, Congress passed improvements to TSCA in the summer of 2016 through the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, one of the first major environmental laws pass ed in decades.120 As discussed in Section II.B, in its original form, TSCA did not allow EPA to require testing of a chemical without adequate prior data about that chemical, but it also did not allow EPA to request such information from the industry unless it already believed that the chemical presented an unreasonable risk to public health or the environment.121 In other words, TSCA 118 See, e.g. , Washington, et al., infra. note 171 . 119 Devid Kriebel et al., The Precautionary Principle in Environmental Science , 109 ENV'T HEALTH PERSPECTIVES 871, 871 (2001). See generally PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT IMPLEMENTING THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE (Carolyn Raffensperger & Joel Tickner eds., 1999). 120 Toxic Substances Control Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 53. 121 Watnick, supra note 76 , at 385. 54 University of California, Davis [Vol. 44:1 only allowed EPA to request safety data from manufacturers if it already knew that the chemical was dangerous.122 Through the Lautenberg Act \u2014named after the former New Jersey Senator who introduced the TSCA reform bill \u2014Congress required that new chemicals be reviewed for safety before being introduced into the market and eliminated the requirement that EPA make a prel iminary finding of risk before requiring manufacturers to submit more data about a chemical.123 For existing chemicals, EPA must now designate substances as high or low priorities based on their potential risk, then issue a rule within two years of finding that the substance poses an unreasonable risk to health or the environment.124 The Lautenberg Act also places more stringent regulations on pre -manufacture notices, which allow manufacturers to commercialize new chemicals without adequate testing data if the new chemicals had a similar compound structure to an existing chemical.125 If applied to PFAS, the Lautenberg Act could prevent new harmful PFAS from being introduced and allow EPA to regulate existing PFAS more easily. Under it, EPA could require manufacturers to submit more data about PFAS' hazardous properties and could desig nate the PFAS family of chemicals as high priority, providing an immediate path to regulation by weakening the presumption of innocence. For new chemicals, although pre -manufacture notices can still be used, EPA can now require additional testing data from parties without showing that the chemicals pose a health risk during review of the notice.126 For the first time, EPA can also restrict the distribution of a chemical by order if the data are insufficient to determine if a chemical presents an unreasonable risk, if the chemical will be produced in a large volume, or if the chemical's use presents a risk under the conditions of use.127 While still requiring cost -benefit analyses in risk assessment, the TSCA amendments make clear that such analyses should not control whether or not a substance is regulated.128 The Lautenberg Act, while progress, is a compromise between industry and environmental advocacy groups. The cornerstone provisions of the law require pre-market safety reviews of new chemicals and preempt states from regulating EPA -designated \"high priority\" chemicals once EPA decides to regulate that chemical itself.129 Industry groups advocated for the latter, as it meant manufacturers would not be exposed to multiple different state regulations of 122 See discussion supra Section II.B 123 Watnick, supra note 76 , at 390. 124 Id. at 393. 125 Id. at 386. 126 Watnick, supra note 76 , at 392. 127 Id. at 392 -93. 128 Id. at 393.

Although the Lautenberg Act offers promising improvements to TSCA, the Trump administration has been bent on pressing its de -regulation agenda and diluting EPA's power in the process. Be fore the Obama administration's EPA could finalize rules implementing the Act, the Trump administration took the reins at EPA and finalized its own rules.132 The Trump administration removed the planned default high -priority designation for existing chemica ls, recommending that EPA take a \"low -priority\" approach instead for most existing chemicals.133 In seeming direct contradiction to the Lautenberg Act's intent to regulate chemical substances from manufacture to disposal, EPA stated that it would not consid er all exposures to existing chemicals from manufacture to disposal, instead allowing the EPA Administrator to determine what conditions of use should be considered for existing chemicals.134 EPA's rationale for limiting evaluation of existing chemicals in this way is that other EPA laws, like the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, regulate exposure during the life of the chemical.135 EPA's narrow approach to reviewing existing chemicals excludes \"legacy uses\" as well \u2014 exposures from ongoing uses as well as di sposals of chemicals that are no longer being made for that use \u2014which restricts EPA's review of many PFAS (like PFOA).136 For new chemicals, the Trump administration's EPA stated that it would consider their effects in \"intended, known, or reasonably forese en\" uses, instead of considering the whole life of the chemical as the statute requires.137 This interpretation significantly limits EPA's power to regulate dangerous chemicals, as it narrows the scope of hazards that EPA is allowed to consider. Additionall y, instead of using its authority to issue orders restricting uses of harmful chemicals, EPA has pivoted to using SNURs for PFAS, which require persons to report any \"significant new use\" of designated chemicals.138 By requiring this reporting, EPA 130 Id. at 389 -90. 131 Toxic Chemicals , NAT.

See discussion, supra Part II.B. 56 University of California, Davis [Vol. 44:1 has an o pportunity to evaluate the risk posed by new PFAS -related manufacturing. However, SNURs do not apply to existing uses and hamper EPA's power, as they cannot be easily modified and significantly slow down the regulatory process.139 Finally, because EPA has f ailed to embrace the TSCA regulatory power offered to it by the Lautenberg Act, it is unclear whether the Act's burden -shifting provisions will have their intended effect. If EPA simply fails to pursue regulation under the reformed TSCA, there is no opport unity for the evidentiary burden to be placed on chemical manufacturers. Thus, although the Lautenberg Act presents a significant step towards overhauling federal chemical regulation, it is only as powerful as its implementers allow it to be. B. The Europe an Union's REACH Program Legislators in the European Union have taken a more proactive stance for regulating chemicals. On June 1, 2007, the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) law went into force.140 The law requir es all chemical manufacturers who produce or import more than one metric ton of a chemical per year to register the product by submitting data about the properties of the chemical and its uses \u2014including how risks associated with the chemical should be mana ged\u2014to the European Chemicals Agency.141 It disposes of the distinction between \"existing\" and \"new\" chemicals, opting instead for a default requirement that manufacturers produce data on their chemicals.142 Registration is required for all new chemicals ent ering commerce.143 The European Chemicals Agency reviews the data submitted and highlights chemicals that could have negative effects on human health.144 Manufacturers of chemicals deemed \"substances of high concern\" may have to apply for authorization of th eir intended uses for the substances, which are granted only if the manufacturer can demonstrate that the risks to human health can be adequately controlled.145 If a company does not obtain authorization, they will be prohibited from manufacturing, importin g, or using that chemical after a specified date.146 Further, manufacturers are required to submit an analysis of potential substitutes for the harmful chemical or a research and development plan if there is no adequate substitute.147 139 Watnick, supra note 76 , at 399. 140 JERRY H.

In contrast with TSCA, it requires all chemical manufacturers of a certain volume to pro vide data about the chemicals, rather than requiring disclosure only when hazardous environmental effects are discovered by the manufacturers. REACH also provides regulators with broader authority to regulate potentially dangerous substances and shifts the burden to producers to demonstrate that the risks to human health from their product will be adequately controlled. This burden -shifting sends a message to chemical manufacturers in the EU that chemical risks must be controlled, eliminated, or justified b y manufacturers.153 Under the REACH system, scientific uncertainty around chemicals of concern is resolved in favor of disallowing a chemical to enter the market.154 Applied to American chemical regulation, this type of burden shifting would not allow indust ry resistance \u2014embodied as purportedly inconclusive safety data \u2014to prevent regulation. As REACH demonstrates, it is sensible to require the producers \u2014who have the capacity and the motivation to refute accusations that their products are hazardous \u2014to bear th e burden of proving the appropriateness of regulation. Further, REACH does not allow pre -existing chemicals to evade regulation by being \"grandfathered in\" to the scheme. REACH's benefits are fourfold: (1) without sufficient safety data, chemical manufactu rers cannot market their products in the EU; (2) the burden of proof is shifted to industry for chemicals of concern; (3) chemical risks are communicated more clearly with the public; and (4) companies are incentivized to substitute safer chemicals.155 The benefits of 148 Wilson & Shwarzman, supra note 75 , at 1202. 149 Substances restricted https://echa.europa.eu/substances -restricted -under -reach/ 150 Annex . 151 Id. 152 Candidate List of substances of very high concern for Authorisation , EUROPEAN CHEM.

C. California's Green Chemistry Approach Domestically, California has taken federal regulatory reticence as an opportunity to craft its own precautionary chemical r egulatory programs. In response to the fears that federal toxic chemical regulation does not go far enough to protect human health, California has passed laws to implement a \"green chemistry\" framework.157 California has long been a leader in chemical safet y and disclosure, familiar to any American consumer who has seen or heard the words \"this product is known to the state of California to cause cancer.\"158 The state's \"green chemistry\" approach seeks to avoid the use of toxic chemicals altogether, rather th an accepting such chemicals as essential and subsequently attempting to mitigate their harmful effects.159 The first \"green chemistry\" law in California, passed in 2008, created the Safer Consumer Products program, which empowered the state to identify and prioritize chemicals of concern in consumer products used in California.160 Under the Safer Consumer Products program, the Department of Toxic Substances Control (\"DTSC\") promulgated regulations requiring manufacturers to seek safer alternatives to harmful chemical ingredients in consumer products.161 The regulations proposed a four -step program for DTSC to use when regulating chemicals in the state: (1) establish a list of candidate chemicals that have harmful qualities, (2) identify \"priority products\" that contain one or more candidate chemicals and notify manufacturers of such products, (3) require manufacturers to analyze alternatives for limiting exposure to environmental harm, and (4) implement any regulatory responses that will protect public health an d maximize the use of alternatives to dangerous chemicals.162 Under the second step in this scheme, DTSC has listed products containing PFAS as priority products and is 156 Wilson & Shwarzman, supra note 76 , at 1202. 157 Oladele A. Ogunseitan, Embracing Global Warmth and Climate Resilience Through Green Chemistry Legislation , 25 HASTINGS ENV'T L. J. 301, 304 (2019). 158 See Safe Drinking & Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, CAL.

The second law, also passed in 2008, directs the state DTSC to create a Toxics Information Clearinghouse, with the goal of increasing public knowledge about the potential hazards associated with chemicals used in California, thereby decreasing the informational asymmetry so prevalent in chemical regulation.164 Requiring manufacturers to submit data on potentially harmful substances allows the public to understand t he risks associated with certain chemicals and reduces the burden on the government to gather toxicity data for regulatory purposes. In its final statement of reasons for the regulations, DTSC explained that the regulations will \"set in motion a preemptive strategy that reduces the use of toxic substances in the design of products.\"165 The Department views its regulations as a \"possible national model for chemical reform.\"166 California's approach effectively combines increased enforcement power and maximal p ublic disclosures to protect its citizens from harmful substances like PFAS. Recently, California has also extended its proactive approach towards PFAS to drinking water sources, requiring water sources with more than 10 ppt of PFOA or 40 ppt of PFOS to be treated or removed as water sources.167 These types of enforceable, health -protective standards flow downstream from the state's green chemistry approach. V. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS As the preceding pages show, some small victories have been won in the fight to protect Americans from PFA S. Most recently, in July 2020, the House Armed Services Committee passed amendments to the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act that would require four primary responses from the Department of Defense: (1) phase out the use of products containing PFAS; (2) meet state PFAS cleanup standards if they are higher than federal standards (as they are currently in some states); (3) publish results of PFAS water testing near military 163 Comment Period Detail on the Regulatory Proposal for PFAS in Carpets and Rugs, CALSAFER , https://calsafer.dtsc.ca.gov/cms/commentpackage/?rid=12751 (last visited Oct. 24, 2020); Comment Period Detail on the Regulatory Proposal for PFAS Tre atment of Textiles or Leathers, CALSAFER , https://calsafer.dtsc.ca.gov/cms/commentpackage/?rid=12746 (last visited Oct. 24, 2020). The products include carpets and rugs containing PFAS (https://calsafer.dtsc.ca.gov/cms/commentpackage/?rid=12751) and treatme nts containing PFAS for textiles and leathers (https://calsafer.dtsc.ca.gov/cms/commentpackage/?rid=12746). 164 Ogunseitan, supra note 157 , at 305 (detailing the codification of this law as SB -509). 165 CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL , R-2011-02, FINAL STATEMENT OF REASONS , SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS 9 (first proposed July 27, 2012) . 166 Id. 167 Jeffrey Dintzer & Peter Masaitis, California Takes the Lead in Regulating PFAS Chemicals in Drinking Water , LAW.COM [Vol. 44:1 sites; and (4) require funding and research into the risks of PFAS contaminatio n.168 However, these small victories \u2014amendments, state rules, disclosure requirements, and others \u2014fall far short of the comprehensive federal regulatory effort required to protect Americans from PFAS contamination. And the contamination from PFAS continues, with endless variations on the same toxic mixture. In 2009, DuPont heralded the arrival of its newest PFAS, called GenX, manufactured in a plant on the Cape Fear River in North Carolina. 169 Responding to fears that the area would become the next Parkersbu rg, DuPont explained to worried locals that GenX was a safer chemical than the ones produced in West Virginia and elsewhere.170 They explained that this new PFAS was designed to be less persistent in the environment than their previous products.171 However, in the following decade, PFAS were identified in the water172 and cancer levels spiked among the 250,000 people who relied on the Cape Fear River for drinking water.173 These revelations come like clockwork. In June 2020, scientists disclosed that they found new variations of PFAS compounds in New Jersey soils.174 Very little is known about these recently -discovered PFAS variants present in the environment, but little evidence suggests that these new substances are any less toxic than their predecessors.175 For all of EPA's talk of PFAS regulation, the agency is poised to approve four new varieties of PFAS in 2020, and new chemical notices for the chemicals indicate potential threats to human health.176 No health studies, chemical names, or other pertinent data have been disclosed for these chemicals.177 In the last three years, EPA has approved 15 new PFAS compounds, and at least 600 PFAS 168 PFAS Reform Provisions Included in Defense Spending Bill , ENV'T WORKING GROUP Environmental Protection Agency Keeps Approving Dangerous Chemicals , HUFFINGTON POST (Feb. 4, 2020), https://www.huffpost.com/entry/epa -pfas-dangerous - chemicals_n_ 5e384be0c5b69a19a4b39504. 170 Id. 171 See Sharon Lerner, New Teflon Toxin Causes Cancer in Lab Animals , THE INTERCEPT (Mar. 3, Carboxylic Acids (PFECAs) and Sulfonic Acids (PFESAs) in Using Accurate Mass Time -of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (TOFMS) , 49 ENV'T SCI. & TECH. 19, 11622 -11630 (Sept. 22, 2015). 173 Perkins, supra note 169 .

These reforms could open the door for comprehensive PFAS regulation if EPA can free itself from the self -destruction that has characterized the Agency in the Trump era. During the brief period after the Lautenberg A ct was passed, and before the Trump administration took over, EPA scrutinized new chemicals as it was supposed to and slowed down the approval process for new chemicals.182 But the success of the Lautenberg Act was short -lived. In order to embrace the preca utionary advantages embedded in the Lautenberg Act, EPA must take a more active role, similar to the European Chemicals Agency, by requiring safety data before allowing chemicals to market, placing the evidentiary burden on manufacturers, and restricting d angerous uses of toxic chemicals. The PFAS saga demonstrates the major gaps in American chemical regulation and suggests that the industry's fears of liability influence EPA's regulatory decisions. Plausible regulatory alternatives are emerging that could fill those gaps, notably the EU's REACH and California's Green Chemistry approach. Both alternatives embrace the precautionary principle, prioritizing human health and scientific conclusions over industry concern. These laws leverage their large constituen t populations to shape global policy, offering models for the federal government of the United States. It is clear that any successful PFAS regulation must tackle the chemicals as an entire class and provide regulators with the tools to gather data on pote ntial harms from the chemicals, shifting the burden onto manufacturers to prove that their products are not harmful.183 But disclosure is not enough \u2014it must be paired with increased enforcement power.

They must leave behind the \"innocent -until-proven -guilty\" approach to chemical regulation and embrace the precautionary approaches now underway in California and the Euro pean Union. At a minimum, EPA should enforce the Lautenberg Act to achieve the goals that Congress intended when it passed the law. Advocates can hope that a Biden Administration's EPA will at least enforce the Lautenberg Act, but a paradigm shift is neces sary to leave these dangerous chemicals in the past: regulators must consider human health first and foremost and adopt regulations that reflect this reordering of priorities.
