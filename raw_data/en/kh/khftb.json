The Institute of Medicine, which advises U.S. policymakers, convened a meeting on \"integrative medicine\" -- combining prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and recovery efforts while also promoting wellness rather than reacting to disease. Institute president Dr. Harvey Fineberg said the approach embraced alternative medicine such as meditation, massage, acupuncture and herbal treatments. It also envisions personalized care tailored to individuals, he said. \"The key concept in all of these ideas from my vantage point is that what matters is whether the evidence shows that the intervention works,\" Fineberg told reporters. President Barack Obama and congressional leaders have pledged to make major changes in the U.S. healthcare system, which is the world's most costly even as it lags other nations in many quality measures. The government says 45.7 million Americans, or 15 percent, had no public or private health insurance in 2007. The concepts being discussed at the meeting could become part of the healthcare overhaul. For example, the economic stimulus measure Obama signed last week included an infusion of money for disease prevention efforts. Dr. Ralph Snyderman of Duke University, a leading player in the institute's meeting, said that \"it is far more effective to intervene early for chronic diseases and to treat them coherently over time rather than treating events when they occur,\" he added. Many chronic illnesses such as heart disease, diabetes and some types of cancer can be prevented through such simple steps as a better diet and more physical activity. Heart disease and cancer are the top two killers of Americans. Reporting by Will Dunham; Editing by Peter Cooney Our "}
